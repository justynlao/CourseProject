Aaron Gordon wants to be traded.  He’s had a good run and now sick of this losing ass franchise that I’ve followed since I was a kid.  He signed a deal for $80 million dollars bro.  If he was on a different team he’d be a super stat.  They tried to trade him to play with Lebron when LBJ was in Cleavland but cavs didn’t take the trade offer.  Imagine it would have been Gordon instead of Love.  What!!!!
"Ok fine you want to do this? I was not going to dignify this with a response while I was on my phone but I have the time now.  &gt;Simmons  You're whole argument of ""he was just boxing out and Simmons jumped"" might hold up, but Lowry moved back into him while he was in the air...he was trying to take out his legs. And yes whole weird incident happened directly after where they both acted like bitches...Lowry shoved his ass in his face on purpose (not dirty but weird af) and Simmons elbowed him in the balls..its a good thing I'm not calling Simmons the clean player here, or else you might actually have an argument.  &gt;Paul George  The Paul George one is 100% an intentional and dirty play by Lowry, and by far the most dirty play on this whole list..as he was going down, he locks PG's arm up intentionally knowing he was going to fall with all his weight onto it..that was fucked up and the most damning example on his list..its embarrassing you're trying to duck this one. If you aren't willing to concede this one, you have zero credibility..although that was already obvious.  &gt;Aaron Gordon  You glossed over it but again, an extremely damning video of him putting a guy in an extremely dangerous situation, and it ended up injuring him exactly as you'd expect. His lack of remorse and tough guy attitude after only solidifies that.  &gt;Bradley Beal  Flagrant and dirty, if it was a one off and the only incident on this list, fine..could write it off, but its not and Lowry is always going way too far and then tries to act all innocent. He wound up and aimed straight for his head.  &gt;Porter Jr  If you ever played basketball in your life, you'd know that if you are not going to go up for a rebound, then you clear the hell out from underneath the guy jumping or else you are going to take out his legs and hurt him. He makes no effort to get out of his way here. He literally stops, looks at Porter, then runs to the spot he is landing...he has really mastered the art of ""accidentally being at the wrong place at the right time"".  &gt;Delly  Great you agree, elbowing a player in the face is dirty, cool. Even though you still feel the need to qualify it lol like you really can't concede an inch though...""ya it was dirty...but he started it!""  &gt;Lebron  Of course you try to get out of this one, he literally latches onto his arm and then once the play is clearly dead, and then he purposefully tries to throw him to the ground and trip him. Just because it didn't result in injury doesn't mean a play isn't dirty..the fact that Lowry is constantly looking for plays like this only solidifies that he is dirty.  &gt;Last Video  He blatantly shoves the guy while he is mid air...did you not just see the Lebron-Embiid play a few games ago? That will always be dangerous and needless...just because the guy didn't end up losing his balance and falling doesn't change the fact that Lowry is once again, looking for a chance to put a guy in a dangerous position...like why make that shove at all? Answer me why that would be a basketball play in any scenario?  And then there is the hipcheck on Ennis...and the close outs underneath shooter's feet and probably countless other instances that weren't captured in a clip.  You think one other Raptors fan chiming in is me getting ""dumped on""...dude you asked what other examples there were and I gave you a whole list and you think I'm the one getting dumped on? lol You and your thin skinned Raptors buddies should just call it a day and keep quiet when your precious players do questionable shit and stop trying to defend their bullshit. I never thought that Raptors fans cheering after KD's injury was a fair representation of your base, but honestly its starting to seem like it is, you guys seem to get off on this shit.  Anyway, I hope you have fun watching the playoffs from the sidelines this year."
What about Aaron Gordon and Kyle Lowry?
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"The way he jumps, the cock back, the flush, even the landing. That’s why for me no matter what kinda dunk Aaron Gordon pulled off there’s no way he could deserve a higher score than LaVine cuz Zach’s shit is just beautiful. Gordon had the difficulty yes but his dunks were almost always ugly from the unclean finish through the rim even to the awkward celebrations lol    Don’t even get me started on LaVine’s jumper. It looks how I thought my jumper looked after watching a bunch of Kobe highlights and going to play with my buddies lol his game is so glamorous"
"Anyone paying attention knows this was just a case of how terrible the Magic (one of the worst teams in the league) were, not how good FVV is. Also, is Aaron Gordon even still in the league?"
"Kuz, Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris, Lonnie Walker"
"&gt;against the most skilled players in his field   Chill, dude. It's Orlando minus Aaron Gordon"
With Aaron Gordon and Cole Anthony why can’t the magic simply jump over the competition?
Kyle Lowry has as many dunk contest titles as Aaron Gordon
"But dude, he has a history of hating Aaron Gordon so of course he knew EXACTLY where his leg was &amp; what he was doing. /s  If Aaron Gordon throws any weight around in attempt to play the the ball this is a non issue. Not Lowrys fault Gordon stood there with his knee straight not playing basketball."
I don't understand why they did this. 2 days later...a flagrant for a normal box out. Did Aaron Gordon and Orlando cry to the NBA? Or do they hate Lowry for some reason
Ok him and Aaron Gordon and crossed off the short term TPE list.
"I like how the Wolves are starting Josh Okogie, a 6'4"" guy who isn't a threat on offense at all (although he does have a 7' wingspan) at power forward because they're so void of defense at the 4.  Aaron Gordon would look immaculate on this team man."
"oooh yeah, rough stuff.  That trade was bad when it happened and only looks worse now.  He also gave Bismack Biyombo all that $$$ in free-agency, didn't he?  Looking at his draft record, he actually did okay all things considered.  I liked the Aaron Gordon pick at the time (and it's been written about that they really wanted Porzingis who went just before their pick), I was frustrated that he didn't make it to the Celtics that year.  Hezonja looks rough now but he was highly regarded coming into the draft.  Jonathan Isaac instead of Donovan Mitchell isn't looking great, but again at the time Isaac was a much more highly regarded prospect than Mitchell was.     Well whatever happens hopefully the Magic can turn it around.  Maybe this year they'll embrace a tank with a strong draft class and minimal revenue to be lost from attendance and they can build something new from the ground up."
How else do you expect a 6 foot guy like Kyle Lowry to box out a giant like Aaron Gordon? Its not like Kyle intended to bump into AG's knee. Unfortunate that it happened but I just don't see the flagrant
Cottonelle. How else do you expect a 5'6'' man to box out a 7'8'' behemoth like Aaron Gordon?
So Aaron Gordon can sucker-check kyle lowry to the ground behind the play and stay in the game  but this gets a tech?
Gonna go down some more for this week due to Aaron Gordon being injured and Nikola Vucevic just got denied at the rim by Yuta Watanabe.
Not every top draft pick is gonna be a superstar. Aaron Gordon is a solid starter in any NBA team. He was drafted 4th. He's not a bust. He's just okay.
"I don't think it helps to bring up another play in comparison the way you are really. And maybe I'm wrong about the asshole part as I hadn't and haven't put much thought or consideration into that and kind of don't want to bc even though def. not a fan of Lowry I kind of am in the sense that I love how good he is and he's someone fun to root against and I'll be sad when he retires. But I think your example is very very different. You didn't know what you were doing and got confused. With the Gordon play he left the air and if you watch Lowry he doesn't even try to jump at all, he knows he absolutely has no chance at the ball and seems to know like an nba vet would that he's about to make a very dumb dangerous foul play , and I've always been of the opinion any foul when someone is in the air is dangerous, and to me Lowry is just being careless af hitting him up top dangerously, and to me it's a dirty play and at very least he's being an asshole that play and should know better from now on. My strong guess too is that Gordon consulted about the play w/ a few others, who of course were biased in his favor so that doesn't help, but Aaron doesn't seem like the type to want to retaliate like that unless he strongly felt as I do also that it was dirty. Just my take."
Rumor has it if he would’ve won at least one dunk contest he would have activated a superior Aaron Gordon but never happened
"I'm just saying that's probably why, I really don't care about how Aaron Gordon is playing"
Lowry boxing out and hurting his knee is... the reason Aaron Gordon rolled his already hurt ankle when he stepped on someone's foot?  This man's reeeeeaching
I feel like every year people say Aaron Gordon will have a breakout season and then he turns out to be the exact same player as before
"I love the Magic and I like Aaron Gordon so I'm sad about this.  Get well soon, Casper."
Pleasant: Terrence Ross  Unpleasant: Aaron Gordon
"All I said was  &gt; 2 things can be cheap  And you jump into whataboutism regarding Lowry's past like it validates AGs check as acceptable.  &gt; This play (among many others) would not have happened if it weren't for Lowry cheap-shotting Gordon mid-air.  How do you know that, are you Aaron Gordon?"
do you not think 6’10” aaron gordon would beat the absolute shit out of kyle lowry? lol
"Biggest takeaway from this game: Siakam's been dealing with nagging bumps and bruises all season, but said postgame that he's finally feeling more like himself. He was assertive and aggressive attacking the paint the last 2 games, maybe this'll be the spark for him to take the next step a lot of Raptors fans were expecting him to!   I for one don't mind it when he shoots a few open threes when he's being this aggressive getting to the rim and earning trips to the free throw line. It brings another dimension to the offense and other teams simply struggle to guard him when he's made up his mind to get to the hoop.   On another note, I watched both Aaron Gordon/Kyle Lowry plays, and Lowry may have put a little extra into the boxout but if you're Gordon, you can't allow the other team's PG to be boxing you out with his hip. That's just lazy, and then to top it off by blindsiding Lowry on a shoulder check is weak shit. Hope his ankle feels better, but man, this dude isn't ever going to live up to expectations playing dumb like that."

"Considering what he did to Aaron Gordon in the bubble and the boxout in the same game that got his knee hyper-extended, I can see why."
"I suffer through Magic games watching Aaron Gordon play the 1, Vucevic be the only player able to buy a shot, our (while very gifted ) rookie have terrible shot selection, and another one of our starters get injured"
Lol Aaron Gordon literally tripped over his own leg out for a couple weeks with ankle sprain lookin baseballish he deserves it kyle plays basketball and is not a dirty player by any means. The hate on this board and anger from not having a chip is real
Aaron Gordon doesn’t want that smoke.
Aaron Gordon is a saint and Kyle Lowry is the dirtiest player of all time.
So you think Aaron Gordon just laid out Lowry for no reason?
"&gt;If it was a boxout then why didn't AG retaliate for the first 1.5 quarters? Why did he retaliate the play after that, and then leave the game because of it...   Players get injured doing routine basketball plays ALL of the time. Are you really using the fact that Aaron Gordon was frustrated, as proof that Kyle Lowry tried to injure him on that box out? I swear this sub's pitchforking has gotten out of control."
Post Kyle Lowry hurting Aaron Gordon
Lowry is a big booty rat and that's all I gotta say about that. I'll join the Kickstarter to free Aaron Gordon
Kyle Lowry has literally eaten charges from Embiid. He isn’t scared of Aaron Gordon
Shit rlly went downhill for aaron gordon after the flagrant
Aaron Gordon.  The definition of average . Don't ever touch the thicc god again bitch ass
*Aaron Gordon casts Vanish*    *Aaron Gordon casts Cheap Shot*
"There's lot's of teams with holes at PG, can probably get an aaron gordon type player for him"
"&gt; If you have to resort to cheap shots on people you are soft as fuck.   Yah, just like Aaron Gordon did this game. If anyone's on Lowry's balls it's you. You can't even see AGs baby food movements past your Kyle Lowry hate."
"If you ""genuinely"" can't tell which part of this clip ""even looks like"" Kyle Lowry taking a shot at Aaron Gordon, then there's literally no room for discussion. The homer goggles are on way too fucking tight"
"Lmao Aaron Gordon is such a scrub. I've watched his entire career and he just doesn't have it. Nowadays he thinks he's a guard, which is hilarious"
You don't know a 10 inch in height and 50 pound difference my friend  Aaron Gordon would literally clap Lowry's Alexis Texas like booty
Aaron Gordon disasterclass today
Lmao seriously. Hip check? He gets boxed out and falls over. Are people on here afraid to call Aaron Gordon soft like they do with every other nba player
How do you know Aaron Gordon grew up privileged? He hooped in Oakland his entire childhood
Its actually unbelievable to me that Magic fans are crying about this. Let me know when the new Aaron Gordon diss track drops.
"I promise you, Aaron Gordon would whoop Kyle Lowry’s fat ass lmao"
Lmao tf is Lowry gonna do to him. Aaron Gordon is almost an entire foot taller
Lmao Kyle ain’t doing shit to Aaron. Gordon would whoop him.
"We can debate that, but tonight (and in this highlight, it's Aaron Gordon taking a cheap shot not Lowry. Seems like youre the one upset about it nephew lol."
Aaron Gordon is soft
Yeah I’m sure Aaron Gordon is just terrified of a guy 30 pounds lighter and 8 inches shorter that goes down from a breath of wind touching him
"AARON GORDON = PIECE OF SHIT, what a fucking loser. HEY MAGIC FANS TRY TO DEFEND THIS AND YOU CAN BE FUCKING LOSERS TOO.   I wanna see you try to defend this!   Piece of shit, ZAZA wannabe. Get absolutely fucked, what a baby."
"Anyone calling Aaron Gordon cheap, how about the clothesline Lowry dropped on AG in the bubble that made injure his hammy that he's still recovering from. All he did was a little shoulder check. Call it square then"
Aaron Gordon still hates Lowry from Lowry taking him out in the bubble
At least Aaron Gordon gave him a leg press workout.
Yeah Barnes is ideal. I think Semi could still play but he shouldn’t be the first wing off the bench. A lot of Celtics fans are talking about Aaron Gordon I’m not into that idea at all unless we somehow get Fourier too
He's got quite a few posters in his highlight reel.

"Aaron Gordon will never be a star, fultz will never get his jumper back, Vuc isnt good enough to be a franchise player like dwight or shaq ,and issac cant be depended on to stay healthy and isnt going to be a superstar."
Cheers just voted Aaron Gordon
When he was with us he had a weird way of making spectacular plays looks so regular. Hes so damn good he makes it looks easy. This clip is blowing my mind because Aaron Gordon is as athletic as they get and he just iso blow by dunked on him like it was nothing.

Yeah the trade doesn't look bad in terms of asset analysis I just think they could've got someone better bc Shamet was very highly valued at the time and the pick was considered valuable too. Like aaron gordon as a spot up and defensive guy who can handle a little. Or even just trading for shooter types like Doug McDermott or Joe Harris + another piece
They gotta move off Aaron Gordon too. Boy he looks checked out
"btw, just noticed this. what the fuck is Aaron Gordon doing up at the top of this thread? 😂"
Aaron Gordon?
"I think Aaron Gordon has the athleticism to be a perennial all-star. He was a 4th pick, insane vertical, 6'8 240lbs with crazy strenght. But he never got to where I thought he would... I thought he would get to a prime Blake Griffin level of play, a bit smaller but more athletic... and he never got even close."
"Guys like Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball will have plenty of suitors -- versatile young guys that have size and upside. They're nowhere near the level of guys like Beal or Harden, but plenty of teams would take a flier on them."
"Would be interesting considering the rut Orlando has been in for the last 5 years. I have no idea what they would give up though. Aaron Gordon, Birch, and a first rounder?"
Aaron Gordon wasn't even mentioned. 😅
"don't forget blake griffin, zach lavine, aaron gordon and pretty much all nba dunk champion"
"Bullshit. Javale McGee did this to Aaron Gordon when he shit all over him last year and it wasn’t even a foul.   Cry harder embiid. It’s a physical sport, no matter how soft the league wants the game to be"
"True, but I’m gonna have to doubt on that one. The Aaron Gordon project is long past due and vucevic can’t do everything alone on that team."
"But then what if you one day say you should have never traded Vucevic, Fournier, and Aaron Gordon?"
Because he did the same shit to Aaron Gordon last year.
"Three $20M guys for one $40M guy, you tell me?  ## [Jerami Grant](https://www.spotrac.com/redirect/player/15391/)  ## [Myles Turner](https://www.spotrac.com/redirect/player/17839/)  ## [Aaron Gordon](https://www.spotrac.com/redirect/player/15356/)  For Curry/KD/Harden/LeBron/AD?"
"Terrence Ross, maybe Aaron Gordon, Larry Nance, Harrison Barnes...  Hard to know who will be available the moment as most teams are playing hard to win."
"Porter fits into the TPE, we just need to send out enough salary to get under the apron. Our TPE is for 28.5M and Porter Jr. makes $28.4M. For all we need to do is send out a little more that $6M to make a trade work.   Thad does fit a hole. He's one of the best Giannis defenders in the entire league and is a capable 4/small ball 5. He's a good high post passer which is something we were missing against Miami's zone last season, and a good switchable defender. He's not a great floor spacer, but he can knock down shots. He's a smart cutter, positional defender, and probably has better touch around the basket than anyone on the team. Essentially he's a fully developed Grant Williams.   He's not the biggest upgrade, but in terms of lower cost moves compensation wise he'd be one of the better ones. People love Aaron Gordon for us, but Thad is cheaper and is relatively comparable for the role we'd have for both."
I'd love to see Aaron Gordon in Boston. He'd be a great TPE option.
"Outside of Brogdon, I'm thinking about Lauri Markkanen, Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Scary Terry, and Bradley Beal.  They bot peaked much imo but they was either underappreciated or simply overlooked."
People act like he robbed aaron gordon of the slam dunk championship. His dunks were legit 10s any year you put those. Not his fault that the judges extended that contest instead of declaring it a tie. AG might have had some better dunks but his were also 10s.
Rosas is certainly a good GM. Him not wanting to overpay for Aaron Gordon isn't a sign that he's bad lol.

Uh oh. Don't Aaron Gordon curse yourself
"Yeah it's tough for us, we played at least 1 game missing every starter except Vooch. Then we got Aaron Gordon back, but he's not an offensive powerhouse. Now that Evan Fournier is back, our offense will come back a bit, but losing Markelle and his ability to drive to the basket took away a major offensive weapon for us."

We need another wing player not a big - basically nobody in the league can guard Embiid/Giannis/AD.   Someone like Harrison Barnes or maybe Aaron Gordon or something.
I bet $100 when they were down 10 late in the fourth and turned it off once I saw Aaron Gordon miss the 3. I log back on an hour later like wtf lol
Yeah but that's because Kemba wasn't healthy.  On most teams he's a SF.  You guys just happen to have 2 SFs.  Like how on our team when healthy we start two PFs but no one would call Aaron Gordon a SF because he plays that position.
Aaron GORDON?!?!?!
Kyrie for Aaron Gordon and fillers  No?
Trading aaron gordon (preferably to us) would help the process
"I legit think that if Aaron Gordon won, he would've given a speech challenging Zach Lavine to run it back next season. Good GOD Wade really robbed us of what could've been the GOAT dunk contest rivalry."
"At first I didn't like the new rule, but imagine if last night when they showed the judges' decision if everyone had picked Aaron Gordon? Shit would have been hilarious."
There's Aaron Gordon if u want a big wing. Probably cost Bridges tho
They had a great dunker with Gordon and didn’t reward him so now why is anyone else gonna do it?  Dude had legendary dunks and no trophy. Imagine trying to waste someone’s time for the dunk contest only to lose for no reason at all.  It’s hard for the dunk contest to be hype because you can go on YT and see someone do a double backflip dunk or some shit nowadays but Aaron Gordon was still impressive.
I mean it was pretty good just a few years ago with Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon. And Derrick Jones jr. this year was just a weird one that not even kids would find entertaining I think. For all the old heads out there.. sorry nothing is going to top dunks like Jordan and VC. Cuz they did it first . But don’t cancel it the kids still like it and it’s still better than nothing
"No I think expectations just need to be lowered. People expect every dunk to be something brand new and amazing, but there is only so much that a person can actually do. Then Aaron Gordon gets both legs over a mascot on a hover board and dunks a ball out of his hands only to lose the contest.  The dunk contest is broken because past dunkers have been too good. That doesn't mean it's a bad contest, it just means we are spoiled."
"The judges could have just said, “You know what guys, we see no winners today. We’ll just give the trophy to Aaron Gordon since he was robbed last year.”"
RIP Aaron Gordon. Looking at you DWade
Pass. Take his 1st dunk championship trophy and give it to Aaron Gordon
Imagine being Aaron Gordon and seeing this win the contest..
"Only because Aaron Gordon and DJJ both brought it hard, and then Gordon got screwed which created a shitstorm thanks to D-Wade  The dunk contest is only as good as its contestants, when your contestants aren't bringing it yeah I'd rather watch Steph Curry tbh"
You might be the first person to ever cause Aaron Gordon a star
Aaron Gordon got robbed during last years contest and decided it’s not worth trying anymore.   Zach is playing in the game so doesn’t seem ideal to use the half time to do a dunk contest.
Last year they screwed Aaron Gordon by manipulating the score - Dwayne wade wanted his ex teammate on the Miami heat to win the championship so he made sure it happened. Now known names backed out.
So I’m an nba casual. Don’t know much. Why didn’t they have aaron gordon or Zach lavine back? I’ve never heard of these dudes and their dunks were pretty whelming
Eh. I was on board on the two or three years prior to the show Lavine and Aaron Gordon put back in 2016. That was by far the best contest I had ever seen.  I think it’s about finding the right dunkers to be honest. It can be exciting...but hard to get everyone up when the dunkers themselves are doing stupid shit like tonight.
Aaron Gordon was so disappointing that year
I don’t wanna see a dunk contest without Aaron Gordon or Zach Lavine ever again in my life
If aaron gordon participated this year he would of still got robbed.
Just give this dunk contest trophy to Aaron Gordon
Shit's so depressing when you remember the good old Aaron Gordon days
Shit's so depressing when you remember the good old Aaron Gordon days
Those were pretty lame dunks... everyone sitting on the bench could do that. He was right to say no one was hyped. Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine was special.
Look at at this way. Aaron Gordon didn’t win but his dunks will be remembered for years while these guys will be forgotten unless they have long success in the nba
Simons really got more dunk contest wins than Aaron Gordon I am sick to my core
Aaron Gordon didn't even dunk this year and he got robbed
Aaron Gordon got robbed man...
Aaron Gordon and Zach lavine really spoiled us and it shows
Apparently aaron gordon should have just tried to do basic as fuck dunks but jumped higher
"Honestly, this just left me feeling bad for Aaron Gordon. I know it's all about the competition in each year (same thing happens with the Oscars), but come on..."
Aaron gordon robbed 🤡
"Aaron Gordon like ""This man won and I dunked underneath my legs and lost"""
Just give this one to Aaron Gordon to make amends for last year
They should have given it to Aaron Gordon after this showing ngl
aaron gordon was robbed
And Aaron Gordon never won one lol
Aaron Gordon got robbed how many times?
Reminder: Aaron Gordon is not a Dunk Contest Champion  But the guy who just dunked eye level with the rim for his best dunk is.....
No one kept this same energy when Aaron Gordon failed to jump over tacko
Aaron Gordon in shambles
Aaron Gordon didn't even participate and still got robbed
Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine really set the bar way too high lol
Aaron Gordon got jipped again
How this guy have a trophy and Aaron Gordon doesn’t
Give it to Aaron Gordon instead
I’d kill to see Aaron Gordon step out like some WWE shit and just maul these guys.
Man just dust Aaron Gordon and Lavine off and lets have round 3
"Okay so this was lame as fuck.  But I'm sorry, even if it had been Zion or Aaron Gordon it would have been lame as fuck.  It's just boring."
Aaron Gordon got jipped again
Did Aaron Gordon &amp; Zach Lavine really kinda ruin this competition by being so good
Aaron Gordon got robbed twice
Either Aaron gordon or zach lavine have to be in it or it's automatically a trash contest
Just watched highlights from last year.  How tf did Aaron Gordon not win?
"I’m still salty Aaron Gordon didn’t win that one. As awesome as Zach’s dunks were, I jumped out of my seat after seeing AG’s dunks. Those were so creative, difficult, and unbelievable"
"Yep. Seems like we've seen almost all the dunks that can be made through almost all of the seasons of the contest. Aaron Gordon made it fresh but even the most creative minds must be having difficulties in trying to think up a dunk which we haven't seen ever. They need to do something to make the dunk contest more fresh though, like a 2v2 all dunks only contest lol"
Aaron Gordon taking the ball out of a spinning Stuff The Magic Dragons hand and 360 dunking it still the best dunk I've seen the last decade
Aaron Gordon got robbed twice
Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon put the dunk contest standard to the moon lmao
When Aaron Gordon should've won it.
They should just give the trophy to Aaron gordon
"""I could dunk CP3 into the basket better than these dudes dunk a basketball"" - Aaron Gordon"
aaron gordon fuming rn
Damn if he did do the Aaron Gordon without the mascot tho....
Trying to copy Aaron Gordon. No way
Stanley trying to do the Aaron gordon
and this is why Aaron Gordon says this shit is a joke and will never return.
These judges would have given Aaron Gordon a 5
"Aaron Gordon and deserves most of their 50, can't blame them."
cassius got aaron gordon syndrome rn...
Something Aaron Gordon does a good job of is hyping up his own dunks when he's done. Stanley needed to make it seem less casual. Great dunk tho.
This ain’t nun without aaron gordon
Unless you’re Aaron Gordon.
Aaron Gordon is sipping bourbon at home and not watching this.
People are gonna be pissed when Aaron Gordon loses this one
Aaron Gordon has put up some amazing dunks to get snubbed multiple times.
The last great dunk contest was the one with Zach and Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon got robbed
Aaron Gordon has been robbed... twice!
"Idk if his knees are up for it tbh, I’m thinking maybe a mysterious man in a hoodie will win the contest and then reveal himself to be Aaron Gordon"
1. MJ 1985 double clutch... cradle... reverse?  2. VC 360 Windmill  3. Aaron Gordon under 2 legs  4. Jason Richardson reverse between the legs off the bounce  5. Josh Smith windmill over K-mart
Aaron Gordon sitting on the ball mid air over the mascot has to be the GOAT dunk.
"That is why I don’t even bother watching this rigged contest anymore. After Dominique Wilkins got robbed because of all the MJ fans I was disgusted and swore I would not ever watch the slam dunk contest again but Kobe changed that. I would sparingly watch these contests and when one of my favorite Arizona Wildcats, Aaron Gordon, made it into the contest and got robbed two years in a row I will definitely not ever watch this contest again no matter who is in it."
I’m a Lavine fan but one of those trophies belongs to Aaron Gordon.
Aaron Gordon
"Harrison Barnes but I don't see why the Kings do that.  Maybe Aaron Gordon, but his injuries are concerning.    Lonzo Ball maybe  and get back another pick from Pelicans."
Buddy for Aaron Gordon direct swap
"For Collins, some possible packages:  Covington + GTJ  Aaron Gordon  MPJ  Dejounte Murray"
Aaron Gordon
So you think that Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine shouldn’t have ever been in the contest?
"God, TJ is my favorite player to have ever played at Arizona. His heart and what he did for those teams was unreal. Both of his seasons were absolutely a blast to watch but that Aaron Gordon was something special."
I have as many dunk contest wins as stupid Aaron Gordon
"You’re talking about that 13-14 season right? Team was nice asf. Nick Johnson was deadly, had a Freshman Aaron Gordon, Ashley and Hollis Jefferson on the wing with TJ running the point smh"
The dunk contest is dying. There isn’t really much you can do right now that hasn’t been done. Last year it got boring watching Derrick Jones Jr. do a between the legs dunk every time and win. Aaron Gordon truly got robbed. Maybe if he won he runs it back this year too. Going to take an extreme amount of creativity to keep it interesting year after year.
Everyone talks about Aaron Gordon being robbed (probably true) but DJJ also had a great ending taken away. DJJ absolutely could have won fair but Wade just handed it to him so people will shit on his award from now on
Aaron Gordon
That's why I'm saying there's got to be some kind of limitation. The /r/nba survivor had fanbases teaming up again the lakers and celtics so if it got down to the final round with aaron gordon and DJJ it wouldn't have been an issue. The first rounds can be judges majority rules since it's usually a non issue. The finals is what needs to be fixed. /u/mogul_w
"Aaron Gordon and Derrick Jones Jr were in a tie breaking round going back and forth at the end of the dunk contest.  The judging table was trying to extend it to go to another round, so they were going to give both guys the same score and just let the best dunk win.  Wade pulled a fast one on the table and gave Gordon a 9 so that Derrick Jones Jr could win because he played for the Heat (if you hear jokes about D Wade and the number 9, that's why).  He basically kinda just ruined everybody's fun by taking a tough competition and giving it to his guy (Derrick Jones Jr had great dunks too, but it was a sour ending).  Part of it was everybody wanted Gordon to win because he's one of the best to participate ever and hadn't won yet, but also just in general having the judging pan out like that got on people's nerves."
Aaron Gordon gave it a 9 tho
Well Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon were pretty good.
"This is what everyone says about someone until they do the contest. Happened with Dame and even Aaron Gordon. The shit these guys can do with no defender and all the time plus angles in the world to run up and do whatever dunk they want will surprise most people.  There are times it didn't turn out right for guys like Richard Jefferson, Shannon Brown, Giannis, etc but I don't think in game dunks themselves are an accurate measure of creativity. The air time itself or practice dunks they do is probably a better measuring stick. I'm curious to see what Caruso can do"
There were people still saying they should have taken Aaron Gordon up until the second Embiid debuted. You're not alone bud!
"i don't disagree. cj's playoff value comes from his ability to buy a bucket, and this has saved us in the playoffs, most recently the nuggets series in 2019. However, i think we would be much better suited with a strong wing player. we've missed out on a variety of trades that could've better suited our team (harden, aaron gordon, gallinari to name a few) and ultimately we're worse off for it. my personal hope is to somehow get derozan this offseason, but we would need to probably sign and trade for salary purposes and the spurs dont need another guard. ben simmons could be a potential trade target if the sixers flame out in the playoffs this year. this comment ended up being a lot longer than intended, my b"
"they needed to get an Aaron gordon really badly, for size + his short roll ability would have been such a monster with Dame and CJ"
Aaron Gordon seems revitalized now. Jokic is so good though. Life must be great playing alongside him
Get Aaron Gordon out of here
"""All-Star potential"" is a weird thing to say about multiple former and current All-Stars. Kinda disrespectful to put Aaron Gordon in with guys like Simmons, Brown, and Ingram tbh"
Really don't understand how Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball are in the same category as Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram.    Gordon has been in the league for 7 years and hasn't sniffed an ASG. Lonzo will never get there. BI and Brown (and KP for that matter) are already All Stars.
"When the Nuggets lose in 5 we’re gonna sit here like “well the games were close until...”   I wish there was parity but I don’t think Aaron Gordon moves the needle more than the Lakes additions in the off season. If they’re back to full health they’re gonna stomp through the west. Bron was the best player in the western conference last playoffs, and AD played like the second best player in the west last playoffs."
"Jazz should have made a push to get Aaron Gordon, but they stayed pat. What a blow."
Does someone want to tell him or should I? If you think Aaron Gordon can reasonably guard Lebron....😭.
"Yeah we have this Murray that averages more points, assists, rebounds, steals on better fg% 3pt% and ft% with less turnovers thab than in the bubble. But speak out of your ass like you usually do. Also we don't have Porter tho is shooting 66% ts and has 22 straight games with 50+% from the field. Yeah, we also don't have the statistically best Lebron defender last 6 years in Aaron Gordon. Oh and I almost forgot that we don't have the MVP"
"Nuggets. I'll call Murray and Mitchell a wash based on last year's series, maybe a slight edge to Mitchell since he's the #1 scorer on his team.   Defense goes to Jazz, but I think Gobert is less impactful because he (and admittedly nobody else) can't stop Jokic at all. I think the Jazz are deeper but the Nuggets have the higher offensive ceiling, and then Aaron Gordon is the difference maker based on how he's meshing with his team so far.   I wouldn't be shocked to see this go 7 games again, I think both teams have their advantages and it just comes down to who elevates in the playoffs"
"Should be Lakers, I don't know how Denver guards Drummond as a lob threat and AD + LeBron.  Lakers will have enough big bodies for guys like Aaron Gordon and Jr.  Lakers should be the better rebounding team as well."
"Kentucky born and raised. Huge college basketball fan of course, always loved the NBA but never had a team to root for. In 2016 I jumped on the Nuggets bandwagon right after they drafted Jamal Murray with the 7th pick and never looked back. I know I missed out on the years of struggle but I’m here now repping like crazy in the KY. Full believer that the Nuggets are taking the west this year. I drove to Nashville right after they announced the Aaron Gordon trade and put 100 on a +1200 future bet. Lakers fans will hate but their time of reigning West Conference Champion is coming to an end. They better be praying we don’t see them in the 1st round. Would hate to ruin Lebron and AD’s legacy with a 1st round exit!!!"
"""Same"" thing is happening to Aaron Gordon in Denver. He never stopped dunking in Orlando (well, 25yo), but he is getting waaaaaaaaay easier buckets with Denver because of the playstyle/gravity around Jokic/Murray/MPJ."
Aaron gordon for mvp is a sleeper pick I like it
Aaron Gordon is going to average like 11 PPG on the Nuggets but be considered an all star and in 15 months get a max contract. It’s actually inspiring watching him become an elite role player.
is aaron gordon the mvp frontrunner?
"Really thought this was a scheduled L, against a solid Spurs on a B2b, no Jamal, Moach gets tossed. Encouraging to see this guys play so well right now... 7-0 in the Aaron Gordon era."
We're seeing that now. He does not have a good team around him compared to some of the fire-power that the superteams have. The man is dragging his team to a high seed in the west. He makes everyone around him seem much better than they are and gets the most out of their skillset just like LeBron did on the cavs. Just look at Aaron Gordon. Traded over and instantly slides in and starts performing.
That’s why I wish we could have got Aaron Gordon. Him getting the ball 4 v 3 out of the trap would have been so good for the team.
"I had(and still do) have some doubts that Murray can be the number 2 on a true championship level team, but Aaron Gordon has definitely helped as a good playmaker that doesn’t really have any major weaknesses. Add on Jokic’s mvp-caliber season and Laker health issues and for the first time, I can really see this being a Finals caliber team. They’re playing better than anyone else in the league right now and will be tough to beat with the Denver home court advantage if they can push into a top 2 seed."
"Aaron Gordon has done a great job on Luka i’m pretty sure, could be wrong"
Depends on what murray and will barton we get game 2 and 3 last year where legit trash by us I was ready to rally behind the fire malone movement because everybody else other than jokic was legit ass those games then murray went nuclear and jokic did what he did. Covert is honestly not that good at guarding jokic on the post and you can see that on how they have defended them this year if jokic mantains his shooting they are going to have gobert outside the paint which weakens their defense. Mpj is also a completely different player he is now a knockdown shooter and plays well to his roll. The problem for us is going to be our defense since we struggle against perimeter threats. I have to see more aaron gordon to see how much we improve on that side
Close series but I’ll go with the Nuggets in 6 or 7. They’ll have the best player on the floor in Jokic and I think the Aaron Gordon addition will help them a lot this year in the playoffs.
He didn’t give Aaron Gordon a 50 in the dunk contest
Giving Aaron Gordon a 9 sure didn't help him in the likability department
Robbed Aaron Gordon of a well deserved Slam Dunk title.   He was also a very dirty player in his playing days.   He is a horrible human being all around.
Ask Aaron Gordon
That's because Aaron Gordon took like 2 pull up 3s a game and like 4 pull up 2s. And hit only 30% of them. He shot like 38% on catch and shoot shots.
Aaron Gordon is huge for them. MPJ has been a completely different player. Jokic is better. Murray is just as good as before. They're a better team than before.
"I will say Jokic neutralizes a lot of what Rudy Gobert does. He is able to stretch the floor and take Rudy away from the rim on defense where he plays best. I think it’s a close matchup but if I were the Jazz I would be scared to play the nuggets. Jokic is going to put up his usual MVP numbers and Rudy has never really slowed him down. MPJ is one of the best shooters in the league and can pull up against anyone. Jamal Murray elevates his game, plays better under pressure, and has proved this season to be clutch. Then you throw in Aaron Gordon, who is proving to be elite at cutting to the rim and get easy looks with his athleticism.   I think the nuggets win the series 5-6 games. Jokic neutralizes Rudy which is the reason the Jazz have such a dominant defense. Then you have 3 players that can hit off balance and difficult shots at a high percentage. And on top of this Jokic and Jamal Murray have arguably the best two man game in the entire NBA. The playoffs is a much slower, more physical, and half court game and the nuggets two best players both excel in this environment."
It certainly will be important.  The West is loaded with elite wings and Denver filled a glaring hole from Grant's departure with arguably an upgrade in AG.  Aaron Gordon is big and strong enough to guard Kawhi and LeBron (and Luka for that matter).
"He's efficient because he plays with Jokic and Murray and he is a 3rd option  Don't get me wrong, MPJ is a gifted scorer and will always be a very good efficient scorer but the efficiency sky rockets when you are playing like that, defenses have to worry much more about the others   Look at Aaron Gordon in Orlando vs now, career 53% TS to 67% TS"
"Small sample size, sure, but Aaron Gordon is having a massive impact in every facet of the game. Not only have the Nuggets climbed to the top of the league in offensive rating, and not only has their defense started closing off the paint, but he's also helping them become a much better rebounding team     Shouts to u/flurray for posting this in r/nuggets: Look at these improvements in rebounding:     Overall we went from:   51.5% (10th) - 55.4% (1st)  Offensive: 29.2% (6th) - 33.6% (1st)   Defensive: 73.9% (13th) - 77.2% (6th)     Last night we out rebounded the Pistons by 14, and doubled them up on the offensive glass."
AG50? Just call him Aaron Gordon lol
Aaron Gordon understands his role perfectly and plays it very well. Great fit for the Nuggets
"I feel bad for how disconnected you are from reality.  Take an athletic forward like Aaron Gordon and compare how slow and unathletic LeFlop was at his advertised peak. NBA has had a good crop of athletic forwards who all leave a loser like the LeShit in the dust in every possible athletic metric.  If the nba wasn't trying to fabricate a fake star, LeCrap would never have made it into a second unit on a real team playing proper basketball.   You are literally trying to carry water for an unathletic bad basketball iq good who has bad hand eye coordination and literally travels and pushes on almost every possession be it on offense or defense.  NBA marketing team convinced the board of directors that they can take one of the worst players to ever make it into the nba into a super star and they won the bet. The turned a guy with minimal skills into the most talked about name in a sport where the skilled players are ignored while LeCrap is talked about. That son is the power of marketing."
I definitely believe the Nuggets have a good shot at taking the chip this year. But won’t be because Aaron Gordon locked up Lebron and Kawhi
Aaron Gordon to Denver is one of my favorite nba moves in awhile.
"Best 3P% season vs. 2nd best vs. 3rd best  * Draymond: 38.8% – 33.7% – 33.3% * Flip Murray: 36.0% – 31.7% – 31.2% * Mike James: 44.2% – 38.6% – 38.4% * Eric Gordon: 44.8% – 39.1% – 38.9% * Aaron Holiday: 39.4% – 34.1% – 33.9% * Roddy Beaubois: 40.9% – 30.1% – 29.2%  Didn't run some kind of advanced search, just a couple guys off the top of my head."
Bulls are one of the winners for sure. But Aaron  Gordon also fits *insanely* well in our lineup   The main lesson seems to be that the Magic are the best bros and best at making teams better with their players lol
Going from Aaron Gordon to Zach Lavine has to be one of the biggest differentials of all time.   What an upgrade for Nikola Vucevic
Going from Vucevic to Jokic has to be one of the biggest differentials of all time.   What an upgrade for Aaron Gordon.
Better dunker than aaron gordon
Nuggets went 5-0 since acquiring Aaron Gordon. That is an 82 win pace.
"Who talks about him as an underdog?  And Harden isn't in the running for it, most people mention Embiid.  Only knock on Jokic is team record. There really isn't an excuse to get a top 2 seed, especially with LeBron out and with Aaron Gordon on the team now."
all this to beat Aaron gordon
Nuggets team will just take turns isoing and Aaron Gordon does what he did in Orlando with Jokic there instead of Giannis. I think Giannis is a better player but the offense isn't going to be close to how it is with Jokic
"Aaron Gordon a noted Doncic defender? You what?  The ""worst"" game Doncic had against Orlando in the last two seasons was a 20/10/10 TD. Otherwise he has scored around 30pt. If you call that a ""noted defense"" then you are really grasping at straws lol"
People must have forgotten that Igoudala back in his philly days was a #1 option. Not a good enough option to take them deep or anything but still an alpha dog. Lonzo is a #6 scoring option on the starting five.  Igoudala was Aaron Gordon athletic while Lonzo is Shaun Livingston(post injuries) type of athletic. Except Lonzo doesn't have nowhere the scoring ability.  Even Lonzo's assists are inflated because he is just throwing the ball to a guy who goes 10/12 or 15/18 in games. Real Lonzo is the guy pre Zion. And that Lonzo is what every team that trades for him is going to get.
That's why I wanted Aaron Gordon so badly
A defensive player. Just like what Denver did to get Aaron Gordon.
"JTA is also from Oakland.  As someone whose lived in the Bay Area my whole life, them Oakland boys are different.   Put it this way, Oakland produced JTA, Gary Payton and Dame.    Go a bit down south and up-town San Jose produced. . . former Mitty (Mitty = Archbishop Mitty High School) star Aaron Gordon.  Gordon is good, no doubt, and I had a lot of friends who went to Mitty, but he's not wired like those Oaktown guys are."
"I think a big part of it also has to do with how poorly run certain franchises are - they obviously don't have the big FA draw that teams in big markets do, so star players probably feel like there's no way up in terms of contention. If their team is contending, then there's no reason for them to stick around (no city life/big market to take advantage of)  Outside of Kawhi - with his really weird situation/breakdown of trust with the Spurs FO - a decent amount of trade demands have come from stuck-in-the mud franchises. AD gave NOLA a lot of solid years, but unfortunate circumstances combined with a poorly run FO led him to leave. Butler demanded out from Minny because it's Minny. And although not a star, Aaron Gordon wanting out from ORL isn't really a surprise - they never choose to tank but constantly make mediocre moves to float around the 7th seed/playoff fringe time for the past few years. Hell, even Kobe was demanding to be traded because of the Lakers FO at one point."
"I think CJ is more consistent than Murray but they're in the same tier of player (you could argue that Murray's ceiling is higher).  Really what separates them for me are the other pieces, I think MPJ/Aaron Gordon/Barton/Morris are better than RoCo/Norm Powell/Nurkic/Kanter.     Also the Nuggets still have Millsap/Green/Dozier &amp; Facu, none of whom are amazing players but all of whom can at least give competent minutes on a regular basis (except maybe Dozier who is up &amp; down but I really like his energy &amp; potential).  Once you get past Nurkic &amp; Kanter for the Blazers there's Derrick Jones Jr. and then some really wild unknowns like Nasir Little &amp; Simons, you can't count on those guys when it matters in any kind of meaningful way."
Aaron Gordon actually kind of resembles Shawn Marion in this situation. He’s extremely versatile defensively that can guard pretty much all positions and he feasts without the ball cutting/diving for easy finishes. Like Matrix his perimeter game isn’t world class but it’s serviceable enough that defenses have to respect it.   The Nuggets look like a championship team now and the only real upgrade would be trying to dump Barton for a defensive 3-and-D guard. Gary Harris was a perfect fit except his offensive game disappeared over the years and he was always constantly injured.
I feel like an Aaron Gordon level player would get a package like that
"Nuggets clearly first, the Blazers/Mavs/Warriors would all kill to have Aaron Gordon &amp; MPJ as their 3rd &amp; 4th best players.  Also Monte Morris is the best reserve guard on any of these teams (Norm Powell is a starter &amp; a wing)"
I'm pretty sure you would get ANT in a deal for Simmons.  Look at what Kevin Love went for. You don't think you could get a good deal for Simmons when every trade involving a star to a desperate team is including multiple firsts these days? Even the trade for Aaron Gordon lol.
"More like will love to see Zach Lavine, vc and Aaron Gordon together in a dunk contest. All in their prime and with proper judges"
Awesome trade. The Nuggets are the next Golden State Warriors. Homegrown and now players are starting to think they have a chance at ring chasing.   I'm glad Aaron Gordon finally gets to play on a contender. RJ Hampton went from a 3rd string rookie to starting. Orlando lost one of the best dunkers in the league but replaced them with a very enthusiastic and young RJ Hampton. Gary Harris was a fan favorite in Denver and always did what was best for the team. So it is fitting for him to make the move to Orlando as well. Denver fans really appreciate Garris's tenure with the Nuggets.
Yes I mean bums like Aaron Gordon
"No, you’re slow. I’m referring to Aaron Gordon not making the HOF"
Aaron Gordon is exactly what the Nuggets needed to finish off the brownie fudge sundae.
I really liked this kid prior to the injury. Think he’ll be a good replacement for Aaron Gordon.
"you're getting downvoted but you're right..Orlando never had a proper guard or floor general during the years Aaron Gordon was there. He was working with literally only developing PGs, Elfrid Payton and Fultz for a majority of his time with one year of DJ Augustin leading in assists (but he isn't really an elite floor general)"
Their offense has been though when Aaron Gordon was with them. They’ve been a bottom-10 offense every season and bottom-5 a handful of times. In 2019 it was because they were the 8th ranked defense.

The sample size for Aaron Gordon is miniscule and shouldn't even be taken into consideration
Nuggets let Plumlee walk though. They don’t lose in 5 if Aaron Gordon is defending AD on that shot.
"Or, even if his handles don't improve, he could be doing what Aaron Gordon is doing for the Nuggets. Off-ball movement for an easy dunk, that doesn't require handle to do, just a desire to make a play. Wiggins has such amazing athleticism, there's no legit reason he so frequently disappears. That dude should be causing chaos for defenses all game long without even having to take a dribble. Cut -&gt; dunk, Catch -&gt; shoot, defend using all the tools at your disposal... he could be so damn good."
I forgot that Wendell Carter Jr left the Bulls and I thought I missed something and Aaron Gordon was on the Nets as well
These new nuggets line up has some nice size. And all of them can ball. Going to be a scary team in playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  Jamal Murray 6'3  Will Barton 6'6  Aaron Gordon 6'9  Michael Porter Jr 6'10  Nikola Jokic 6'11
"Yep, and if somebody is going to say that he was carried by Aaron fucking Gordon and then turn around and then give the MVP to a guy who plays with Durant they're out of their fuckin' mind."
"yeah, but Aaron Gordon"
Fuck Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon is a Rasheed wallace on 04 pistons level fit and I hate it
Undefeated since Aaron Gordon trade. Did someone call the cops cause now they’re 5-0
Aaron Gordon is the truth
"Refs were absolutely dog shit. I mean, I don’t believe in conspiracies or anything, but jeez man....  Carter played real well, our boy RJ looked good, we are all rooting for him —- our 2nd bench lineup was way better than our first, Ross was a good player.... but Aaron Gordon is the fucking man. I was so bummed when he lost Grant but seeing this guy makes me not a give a shit. This dude is so smart, so good on defense, his strengths are our weaknesses before him, he’s a stud in offense, physical, athletic, has been big in big moments.... he’s the bees knees"
Aaron fucking Gordon
"oh wow, an Aaron Gordon dunk that actually means something"
Aaron gordon is Walmart brand okeke
I don't miss Aaron Gordon bricking free throws
Denver owes the magic a win for giving them Aaron Gordon
The Aaron Gordon trade was awful.
Our post game threads have been POPPIN.  So much optimism around the Aaron Gordon trade.
"I mean, you could theoretically give him a co-star like Chris Paul or even a guy like Chauncey or Rip. if that's against the rules then you'd need like the highest level of role players possible to make a championship team. You might make the finals in the East or something, if it all breaks right at least, but not a championship.   Beyond that, let's say you could just import him to a team and hope to wins. championship, honestly, put him on the Spurs and that could get you pretty far. the issue would be defense, so maybe you could have traded for Aaron Gordon or someone like that to help fill out the defense. tough to say if you aren't going to give him another star in his tier."
"Nuggets gonna make their own album this year.   JaVale McGee aka [Pierre](https://youtu.be/Y89lvA-LrfE) with the production. Aaron Gordon aka [Aaron Gordon](https://youtu.be/8iD9clrWhUs) got bars, and of course the OG Will Barton aka [THRILL](https://youtu.be/TNaJRsguFqE) bringing it.   Nugget, Nuggets, Nugget, Nuggets, and Nuggets because we spit hit fire."
"Don’t be surprised if we lose some of them tho.... I feel like it don’t matter who we play because we can blow out teams like the bucks but also get blown out by the raptors. I think Aaron Gordon really helps that though so maybe 13-0 maybe?!?! Also the first week of may is tough with like nets, knicks, Jazz, Lakers, Clippers"
They’ve also added Aaron Gordon since than
"I mean, I don't think KAT does xD  It's like Lowry and Aaron Gordon."
"He is a ""December baby"", for many things that have a cutoff at Dec 31 these people are going to be among the youngest. For some things it is great (NBA Draft) but for other things it is not so great (school).   Giannis is also a December baby, he is just 2 months older than Andrew Wiggins and 3 months older than Jabari Parker, both selected in the 2014 draft. Only 9 months older than Aaron Gordon who was the youngest in 2014."
Nuggets are better with d arrival of Aaron Gordon. Nugs in 6 games.
"That’s the risk you take. If they develop a shot, then you’ve got a scary athletic player that can shoot. See: Richard Jefferson, Aaron Gordon, Kawhi, Paul Millsap, Jerami Grant, D Rose, Amare Stoudamire. All athletic guys that couldn’t shoot but learned to."
"And it’s especially silly because every top player needs specific complimentary pieces in order to be a contender, with pretty much no exceptions. I bet if KAT had Aaron Gordon or Siakam at PF next to him the Timberwolves would immediately look different, and this conversation would change."
Who has a better story than Aaron Gordon?
"Yeah, but was he being held back by Aaron Gordon.  In reality it’s not the case.  He is just getting slightly more minutes and a higher usage but he was doing well before the trade playing off of those guys.  He just fits in like a glove regardless of role.  I just think it comes down to coaching and the fact that Lavine was injured.  Also AG is doing fine in Denver and Evan is turning things around in Boston when he doesn’t have to watch everyone else iso for the whole shot clock."
"Aaron Gordon is 25, hardly part of a young core  Fultz is bad"
"Bagley in the future probably. Aaron Gordon, DLo."
Duane Reade wouldn't give Aaron Gordon a 9 for that dunk
Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon looks like a taller Matthew Lillard.
"Keep in mind, none of the 3 are main options on the Nuggets and Gordon wasn't the main option on the Magic, Vucevic was.  Until he got injured, Jamal Murray was averaging 21.2 pts, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists.   Aaron Gordon is averaging 12.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.3 assists while playing easily the best defense on that entire Nuggets team.   Michael Porter Jr. is currently averaging 19.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.1 assists and will be an All Star next season or the season after, especially if he continues this pace."
"MPJ has the potential to be an all star, but he isn't one yet. And Aaron Gordon is not an allstar nor I don't think he will ever be one"
"3 of their 4 other starters. Jamal Murray (before he got injured this year, obviously), Michael Porter Jr., and the trade deadline pickup Aaron Gordon."
I apologize so much. Now I finally realized that they have AARON GORDON
Dude you’re not getting it - they have AARON. GORDON. Who has never really done anything of note ever!
well thats really...weird. lol you know the nugs lost their second best player right? you think we can't take the nugs to 6? youre def down on us if thats the case. Youre way overrating Aaron Gordon as a defender lol
"You’re way too down on us man, Luka is one of the best playoff performers in the league and ain’t no Aaron Gordon gonna stop him"
"Aaron Gordon does not defend Luka better than fucking Kawhi Leonard, maybe better than PG, but I have no worries, he will be able to score, and the Nuggets other defenders are even more abusable on the switch than the Clips."
"Thats the Millsap from a few years ago, there is a reason he got replaced with Aaron Gordon."
Minnesota could’ve really used a PF like Aaron Gordon next to KAT
"If Kawhi,PG,Morris and Bev for 1 game didnt stop Luka im sure Aaron f-ing Gordon wont stop him lmao. Yall putting to much faith in him. Luka lives in the pnr and he will get rid of Gordon everytime thru it. Same thing happend with Kawhi and i let you guess for yourself who is a better defender between them."
Who's stopping Jokić over a seven game series? Willie Cauley-stein? Dwight Powell? Boban? Jokic would feast.   Nuggets at least have a few decent wing defenders in Aaron Gordon and Will Barton who can try to slow down Luka.   I think nuggets win this in five.
"&gt;Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, Kristnaps, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson.  Yes I'll take one of those, thanks."
"Well obviously they’re gonna have to settle for less than KD/Harden those are like top 5-6 players in the league lol.  They still have all of them under contract for another year. And we’ve seen that all 3 have missed big chunks of the season yet their roster has really solid role players. They got their shooters already in Harris and Shamet (who has really come on lately). Claxton has all the tools to be an elite defensive force in a year or two. Brown has been solid. Dinwiddie may also be a possibility to stay (we’ll see if he gets a good contract elsewhere). So even Kyrie with the exiting players is good enough to be an 8 seed in the East, they can go off spending chunks of money on guys like Derozan, Aaron Gordon, JV, etc. and still be a playoff team in the east even if they’re not a contender. Worst case they can take on overpaid contracts like Wall that’ll still make them competitive.   I truly think there’s a big chance that the rockets don’t get a single lottery pick out if it. The fact that they got a big mystery box with no known value to it for a top 5 player in their prime is absolutely egregious to me. I don’t think that’s ever happened before."
"I watch Aaron Gordon play (who most people would assume is a far better athlete than Jokic). But, he is always falling over while trying to take the ball to the rim because has sub par balance and coordination. It's just one of the few reasons why Jokic is so Robust and injury free."
"&gt; Also, if the Minny picks conveys this year, the Dubs should be charged with robbery as a result of this trade.  Injuries to Russell and KAT have drastically changed the perspective people have regarding this trade. Here is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ezw6ph/wojnarowski_golden_state_has_agreed_to_trade/)from when it happened.  In the end, I truly believe there is no way to view the trade as a robbery because:  1) Wiggins clearly wasn't able to be maximized by the Wolves organization  2) The theoretical benefit of keeping KAT happy cannot be measured (he wanted to play with D-Lo)  3) At worst the pick conveys this year at 4th overall (or in theory next years draft at #1 overall). Although lottery picks are always valuable, it's really the 1 or 2 pick that usually provide immediate value. Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, **Kristnaps**, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson. Obviously different organizations can be better at drafting but that's 11 drafts in a row where the #4 pick (outside Porzingis) hasn't produced all-star level talent.  4) On top of all that, the Wolves do not need more young, developing talent. If the pick conveys this year at 4 (in what is supposed to be a strong draft) we miss out on that asset but with KAT on the team we should be trying to compete for a playoff spot.  Looking back at the thread, many people predicted a Wiggins renaissance. Clearly the Warriors saw that potential and I'm assuming our front office did as well. But it was definitely the right move for the Wolves to make, even looking at it now."
When did Aaron Gordon become AG? I legit had to google it haha mental block
I feel that Zach Lavine vs Aaron Gordon dunk contest will still be seen a few decades later. It won't be as famous as either the Vince Carter or Dwight Howard one but still will be in top 3 best dunk contests.
"&gt;what the fuck are you talking about dude. this wasn't some bullshit ""flash"" play that had no utility beyond aesthetics.  It precisely was.  All Campazzo needed to do was throw the ball over the four defenders, and he could've done so earlier in that case.  &gt;this was simply a brilliant pass.  No, it wasn't.  It was riskier than necessary, for the reasons I clearly described.  Fun to watch, but not brilliant.  &gt;it's not like Aaron Gordon is Kwame Brown or something. he's fucking Aaron Gordon!  Doesn't matter who he is, all bigs are worse at catching low passes.  Bounce passes are also harder to catch in general, because bounces aren't always predictable."
"what the fuck are you talking about dude. this wasn't some bullshit ""flash"" play that had no utility beyond aesthetics. this was simply a brilliant pass. i mean, it fucking worked perfectly. it's not like Aaron Gordon is Kwame Brown or something. he's fucking Aaron Gordon! dude can catch lobs with the best of 'em, since when are his hands a concern and since when is he a ""big man""? he's literally one of the most athletic players in the league."
So huge.   People focus on the Murray injury not realizing how many other significant injuries we’ve had or still have  Aaron Gordon Monte morris Will barton PJ dozier  Even millsap missed a game or two.
"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.   That roster will be a conundrum for people in the future  &gt;Kyrie Irving &gt;Jaylen Brown &gt;Jayson Tatum &gt;Gordon Hayward  &gt;Al Horford  That’s just insane considering the role players like Marcus Smart, Aaron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris. They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it’s hard to forecast the future.  Can’t believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
"Unfortunately wings don't grow on trees.   CJ makes near 30M a year and needs to be a point guard. I think the best-case scenario is getting someone like an Aaron Gordon-level player back but who's available that would fit that role? Also once again, salary match is a thing."
"I haven’t watched the Nuggets recently, isn’t that what Aaron Gordon is supposed to do?"
"Oh, is this that thing again where the Knicks are allegedly a Top FA destination, and instead end up with Pat Beverly and Aaron Gordon?   It’s a tradition as old as time."
if u think aaron fucking gordon can guard KD idk what to tell u dawg lmfao
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
"He’s kind of a tricky player to hide, because he can’t protect the rim at all yet also can’t guard all the modern 4’s who are basically just big wings.    So even pairing him with a good rim protector in Turner doesn’t really work, I’m not sure how you solve it.  Maybe he needs a defensive 4 like Aaron Gordon?  I think it’ll always be difficult to figure out where he fits on that end."
So we’re just gonna pretend he hasn’t had murray for most of the year? How about porter? Will Barton? Aaron Gordon? Warriors are giving two way guys 30 min a game lol.
The nuggets bench is kinda sketch. I guess Aaron Gordon resting really fucks up their depth
"Pretty much. Aaron Gordon,Bam or even Larry Nance Jr. would be the perfect pairing."
"Anytime I say that in the celtics sub I get downvoted lol.  The excuses are always ""But Tatum's still young!"" as if he isn't nearing his mid-20's with a wife and kid.  Brown clearly defers (to his detriment) to Tatum and Tatum is too busy doing his best (not good enough) Kobe impression most days...but if he scores 40 one game then all the bad play the weeks prior gets overlooked.  They need to trade Kemba *and* Smart, try to get a proper PG like Ball, and then get a proper PF/C.  So many people think Turner would've been bad but he would've definitely been better than Kornet/TT/Parker/Fall/GW.  Hell, they could've made a serious offer to Orlando for Vucevic.  Ainge def coulda beat Wendell Carter, Otto Porter, and 2 firsts.  But all the delusional fans in the sub were like ""Nah, Vucevic is overrated"" or ""Aaron Gordon is garbage, just wait for Grant to hit his stride"" (lmao)    Collecting picks like pokemon cards all these years and only ending up with Fournier (who has been terrible) and Kornet is a failure.  Brad has lost the team, they maxed a PG who definitely isn't ""the guy"" (and also can't stay healthy), and they're wasting the Jay's while they have them.    No one seems to realize that in today's NBA...you consistently put a mediocre team around a star they're likely to leave the first chance they can and they'll probably team up somewhere.  I wouldn't be surprised that if Boston is consistently an early playoff exit the next 2-3 years then Brown is gone in 2024, and Tatum would follow in 2026 when they're both UFA's."
"Well like  Aaron Gordon, KD, Tatum, Marcus Morris, Bojan Bogdanovic, these are your “forwards”, and are players you probably wouldn’t want playing either SG (struggle to guard quicker players), or C (too small, not strong enough, for bigs)"
"Iunno man. Hield just got a $20+ million per year contract and I think Wiggins is better than him. Aaron Gordon is on the end of a $76 million over 4 years contract and his best season was 17/8/3. Jerami Grant, who is a year older than Wiggins just got a $20 million per year contract and his best year was 14/5/1. And people are acting like it's a steal with him averaging 22.5/5/3 this year and those numbers Wiggins could definitely hit as a first option.   Wiggins is almost certainly gonna get a second max or a near max, in my opinion, unless he takes a cut to stay with the Warriors."
Wiseman is out for the season and Oubre is hurt. Looney is solid when he’s healthy. Draymond is amazing on defense but outside of him and Curry you have a bunch of role players. Wiggins is a decent 2 way player. Aaron Gordon averaging 10 ppg only furthers my point.
"Lol bro Aaron Gordon has averaged 10/5/2 with the nuggets in 20 games with everyone injured  I’ve watched a couple of their games lately and campazzo has a bigger impact  Draymond is probably still a top 5 defender plus he’s a great passer, Wiggins is pretty good this season, oubre is mediocre, wiseman is the #2 overall pick, looney, and yeah the rest are role players   Warriors aren’t as elite as they used to be but they still probably got a better they still have more talent imo then a grizzlies or wizards outside of Curry, aren’t the warriors like top 5 in spending this season?"
Look at the nuggets roster compared to the dubs. How can you argue that Jokic has done more with less? Even without Murray. Warriors are playing 2 way players big minutes and nuggets just picked up Aaron Gordon.
"They probably wouldn't have gotten any better a deal at the deadline. Guys were getting traded for pennies.  He brought them a FRP and salary relief... Basically the same deal that Aaron Gordon went for.  But by dealing when they did, it brought back some very BIG (albeit unforseen) benefits.  1. The trade created the friction in the Cavs locker room that spawned KPJ's outburst, leading him to get traded to Houston almost immediately afterwards.  2. The Milwaukee FRP opened up a path for extracting more value for PJ Tucker at the deadline than they were otherwise likely to get."
They added Aaron Gordon and MPJ got a year it’s close
Aaron Gordon
"I remember when someone said that Jokic doesnt deserve MVP because he has Big Three in MPJ and Aaron Gordon. I like Aaron, but he scored 0 points tonight."
Where did all the Aaron Gordon stat lines go?
I blame Aaron Gordon.
"What's going on with Aaron Gordon? I think he's a great addition, but ever since Murray went down he's not really producing. I thought it'd be a perfect opportunity for him to step up, MPJ on the other hand has been balling since Murray got injured."
"I've always assumed their first choice was to trade Trent for Aaron Gordon, so they can have the Gordon-Covington-Nurkic front court to make up for the defensive liability of Dame-CJ, but Orlando would rather have picks than Trent, so Portland went with plan B trade for Norm.  Norm's been great but I think Gordon would have taken the Blazers to a higher level due to his size and defense."
Aaron Gordon/Millsap pairing is *killing us* right now
Aaron Gordon is really playing the 2. And it’s working beautifully
"Ya that's what I was trying to say haha.   Nuggets have a good defense. That means they have good defenders executing a defensive scheme properly.   People trash Nuggets players on the defensive end because they have no clue about Malone's scheme or watch many of their games. MPJ and Jokic are both plus defenders.    And just logically if they aren't good at defense...... then Aaron Gordon must be the best defender in NBA history to carry lineups with those two, Facu, and Austin freaking Rivers to great team results. Lol."
"We lost our second and third best players to injury for half/most the season. We not only lost our starting SG and C but also our backup C/PF (gone for the whole season, maybe his career is over). Keeping in mind that the replacements we found for these guys are deeply flawed cast off pick ups. Damian Lillard carried us to the 4th seed (I think it was 4) before HE went down to injury for a stretch that saw us drop to 7th seed.  I'll admit I'm not aware of any of the teams ahead of us having nearly that level of sustained injury problem.  Nuggets lost Jamal for the rest of the season recently, but they also picked up Aaron Gordon.  Suns...who has been injured on the Suns?  Jazz...Injuries? Donovan Mitchell recently turned his ankle right? Out for a week? Have they had any major injuries?  Clips, I know you guys have enough talent to actually rest your players on back to backs and such. What kind of injuries have you had?  Not sure about the Mavs. Porzingas is probably hurt though.  Lakers, Obviously just recently Lebron and earlier this season AD for a while. So, while they have had injuries...again they also have actual talented basketball players to fill those gaps. Whereas we do shit like play our 10 day contract Rondae Hollis-Jefferson for significant minutes."
"Yes, but Lavine is beating Westbrook in Dunk Contest Championships That Arguably Should Have Gone To Aaron Gordon."
"I’ve wanted Thad Young on the team for the longest time, maybe since LMA left. Aaron Gordon would also have been perfect but apparently our GM didn’t want to give up Anfernee Simons for him"
"The Pelicans hired Aaron Nelson, the Suns' head athletic trainer back in 2019 who had been with the Suns for 26 years before then, so their staff is probably on the rise.  Before then they were bottom tier, sporadic injuries to AD and Gordon with minimal updates."
"Neil Olshey should get a lot of blame. They have 0 ball handlers outside of Dame and CJ and its not like CJ is an amazing playmaker, so as soon as Dame gets doubled they just stand and watch (and I know that's on coaching). They need a major roster revamp and players like Aaron Gordon for example who can help push the pace and allow Dame to play a bit more offball."
"He’s at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He’s at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He’s at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn’t worth anything close to what he’s making. He’s turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don’t make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."
"Trezz, KCP, Caruso, Kuz, Gasol would all be welcome additions on your roster bro stop lying to yourself. The only player on your roster that would benefit us is MPJ and Aaron Gordon.   And I xould care less about free agency. Thats the dumbest argument. Am I supposed to feel bad people want to come to my city. Should I cry when Lebron would choose LA over Denver."
We have a never injured Carsten Edwards for them for the low low price of Aaron Gordon
2019 Aaron Gordon better than 2019 Lebron confirmed.
Where were you when AD talked crap after taking a contested floater over Aaron Gordon?
okay aaron gordon!
My brain thought that had to be Aaron Gordon even though my eyes knew that wasn't exactly what he looks like.  This jist reminds me of that game when McGee was on the Warriors and hit a similar shot only for the camera to find a flabbergasted Jon Stewart in the crowd right after.
Do you think Javale's nephew is Aaron Gordon?
Aaron Gordon saying he was shooting that lol
Still salty that Aaron Gordon has an argument for best Slam Dunk participant ever and doesn’t have a single trophy
I just wanna say I was right that Aaron Gordon was a really good player in a bad situation
Let’s be real if we cared about tanking we would’ve kept a disgruntled Aaron Gordon who would’ve done all the tanking for us by pouting and pretending to be Kobe.
vucevic and aaron gordon are no longer on the magic :(
Reverse Aaron Gordon
One of my all time faves are also the magic with  PG - Penny Hardaway SG - Tmac SF - Vince Carter or Aaron Gordon  PF - Dwight Howard C - Shaq
"How is Curry carrying a team by putting up 20 3s less exciting than your standard 1-8 or 2-7 first round match-up? You're talking about the playoffs like all 30 series are incredibly close best of 7s with comparable talent on both sides when it's the exception to the rule to have a low seed even make a game or two interesting before being kicked out of the playoffs.   To be clear, you are saying you would rather watch the Magic lose to the Bucks 4-1 in a boring first round series that no one watched instead of the Skyfucker fuck the sky? You're objectively wrong to prefer watching Vucevic and Aaron Gordon have no chance in a series over Steph Curry have no chance in a series if you actually like watching basketball."
"THT is ""definitely"" worth what Aaron Gordon went for."
"I was impressed by him against the Lakers in the playoffs last year. Denver has so many pieces they can plug in seamlessly, and the Aaron Gordon trade was a master stroke by the FO.   Such a shame Murray got injured."
"Man imagine how bad the Mavs would look if Luka was having to carry some true scrubs like MPJ, Aaron Gordon, or Will Barton instead of this excellent team /s"
"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
I'd be surprised if Nuggets don't win a championship in the next 5 years.   Jokic. MPJ. Murray. Aaron Gordon.
And? They didn’t have Aaron Gordon when they beat the lakers with everybody playing by 17 points a few days later. None of this necessarily means anything but the Bucks have played as good or better games than this last one and it’s discrediting them to say otherwise
Aaron Gordon fits so well on this Nuggets team.
"Look, I'm not the one who brought up this nonsense about the Lakers lack of playoff experience. That other guy did and you wholeheartedly agreed with him, so that's on you. Don't be mad that I just pointed out how ridiculous that was.  &gt; What matters is how did they play in those games, how many series have they won, *how many minutes have they played.*  See, you're still trying to pursue this stupid line here. FYI, MPJ has played 451 total playoff minutes and Aaron Gordon has played 164. Here's the numbers for the Laker guys you think have little experience:  * Schroder - 1077  * Trez - 434  * Matthews - 1537  * Gasol - 3307  * Morris - 998  * Drummond - 258  Meanwhile Jokic has played a total of 1251 playoff minutes and AD has played 1299.   You really need to step back and look at how absurd your argument is. Out of one corner of your mouth you're saying the Lakers don't have much playoff experience (even though they have much more than Denver does), but out the other side of your mouth you're saying they're too old. So to you they're both too experienced and inexperienced at the same time. You'll have to let me know how you've squared that in your head. I mean, check out these two statements from you:  &gt; I'm not saying Lakers ""lack of playoff experience"" will hurt them in this postseason.  and   &gt; Thats what I mean, exactly  Additionally, you say this:  &gt; you can't ignore that ""very young team"" won back-to-back series when they trailed 3-1.  And *you* can't ignore that that same Denver team got absolutely smacked in the WCF 4-1 by *checks notes* the fucking Lakers! Your entire argument is basically ""if we only look at the selective things I want to look at and ignore everything which would counter what I'm saying, then I have a pretty good argument."" But that's not how this works, and you're absolutely awful at trying to present a case here so I think you should just quit."
Aaron Gordon smart for cutting right there unsung hero
"I didn’t say unnecessarily. Reading is hard.   You don’t treat those guys as being *untouchable* which is how the Mavs FO acts. If there’s a Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, etc. type out there then you can’t be afraid to give up solid players to make your team better. Dallas’ FO over the years has chosen to stand pat when they’ve had opportunities to improve their team, primarily because they, like you, overvalue their current players."
"Are you *really* trying to make the case that Denver has more playoff experience than the Lakers? The Lakers are one of the more veteran teams out there while Denver is very young. If you look at all the top West teams, tell me who has more experience than the Lakers do? Utah? Phoenix? Denver? The Clippers? Dallas? I mean, what a truly bizarre thing to attack the Lakers for.   &gt;I know it’s not as much as LeBron but outside of him who has gone deeper in the playoffs other than when they were Lakers? schroeder? AD? Morris? Drummond? Outside of LeBron these players have minimal experience in the playoffs.  First, does the playoff experience the Lakers got last year not apply for some reason? They won a championship, but for the sake of this argument you want to just throw that out like it's not something those players can build on and draw from?   Also, just FYI, Schroder has played in 46 playoff games in his career (by comparison Jokic has only played in 33). Morris has played in 45 playoff games. Wesley Matthews has played in 46. Montrezl Harrell has played in 26. Marc Gasol has played in 94. Anthony Davis has played in 34. By comparison, MPJ has played in 19 and Aaron Gordon has played in 5, but for some reason you think the Lakers' lack of playoff experience is gonna hurt them in the postseason?"
"We should have done anything to get Aaron Gordon. He compliments our team so well. Some passing, some finishing, mobile defender and can reliably hit the open three? Would have been perfect"
"MPJ was shining before Murray got hurt though. That Aaron Gordon trade really unlocked him.     In the 10 games from the deadline to Murray going down MPJ scored 22ppg on 16 shots, shooting 55 percent from the floor and 40 percent from three.      In the 10 games since Murray got hurt, he's scored 25ppg (seems like he's had more room to grow and take more shots, right) on 17 shots (nope, he's just become more efficient), shooting 57 percent from the floor and a mind numbing 51 percent from three.      I think the injury that's really opened the door for MPJ is Barton.      From the time Murray got hurt to when Barton got hurt, MPJ scored 22ppg on 14 shots, shooting 57 percent from the floor and 51 percent from three.      From the time Barton got hurt through today, he's scoring 29ppg on 19 shots, shooting 57 percent from the floor and 51 percent from three.      MPJ didn't get more shots until Barton went down, and we had no choice but to make him the second option behind Jokic."
"I get the point you’re trying to make but CP3, Conley, Tobias, Jrue Holiday, Aaron Gordon were all added via trade to these teams and Randle was added via FA. They’re all a mixture of both homegrown talent who added pieces vis trade/FA to make them contenders"
"How come the fully unleashed MPJ didn't do that with a healthy Murray tho. The murray injury gives him more of an opportunity to take more shots. His shot attempts increased by 8 after the MPJ injury so I doubt he would be playing at the level he is playing rn. Don't get me wrong, he will still play great, but not at the current level he is playing rn. Also how can you say their defense has improved when their defensive rating last year was 110.4 but this year it is 111.4. I also think Jerami Grant is a better defender than Aaron Gordon personally."
"they didn't get better, nah. remember before the injury? the nuggets looked like the best team in the league, Aaron Gordon was blending in perfectly, had a crazy win streak"
Same for Aaron Gordon.  But I think Rivers and AG contributions on defense more than make-up for their shooting woes.
"It is SUCH a shame Murray is hurt. The Aaron Gordon trade was so good. Jokic is mvp, and they are playing out of their minds. They had a legit chance at getting a ring."
"Aaron Gordon on Luka, you sure you want that? Lmao"
"Great cut by Aaron gordon.  Got Kawhi to help, leaving Facu open."
Aaron Gordon holding the ball for way too long
"Aaron Gordon has been so good for the nuggets, guards Kawhi as well as anyone"
"I like Jokic and acknowledge his year, but no one seems to ever make note of the supporting casts here. Jokic &amp; Luka are doing basically the same thing except one guy has Jamal Murray, MPJ, and now Aaron Gordon plus a deep bench. The other got KP for what won’t even be 45 games so THJ has prob been the second best player. Like 4 wins separate those two teams so you tell me who’s having to do more?   CP3 also just pulled a 9th seed to 1st seed this year."
"Nice! That’s a great def. rating.   Like I said, I don’t know much but man did he struggle 1:1 v Aaron Gordon, Jokic, etc. that last ten minutes probably helped his rating skyrocket so not sure if the numbers tell the whole story on that one but yeah you asked, I just gave my opinion of one game I watched."
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."
"Definitely Aaron Gordon. That's his number, mr fucking 50"
"Well your original comment made a fairly specific criticism.  I think he can guard 4’s fine. For the most part if teams like Denver want to post up Aaron Gordon on him, I think they’d live with that. Gordon had 10 points in the game."
"It's so bad. The Sixers could have sold high any of the previous years but they held out hope that Simmons would get better, at anything at all. Now, they're pretty much bound to sell this offseason and will 100% get the worst return they possibly could off of him. Last season he'd fit in star trade rumors; this season he might be worth a few more picks than Aaron Gordon.  For most players their welcome to the NBA moment is getting destroyed by a superstar on another team. For Ben it'll be being unceremoniously shipped to a bad team for mediocre assets because he's only gotten worse in a league that was already moving away from his skillset."
Aaron Gordon is Simmons without playmaking.
If Aaron Gordon is so great then why trade him for Simmons? Everyone that saw the Suns series know Gordon stinks.
Rich Mans Aaron Gordon
"Aaron Gordon stinks, no thanks."
Aaron Gordon + Barton for Simmons.
"THANK YOU!!! Finally someone said it. I’m a huge nuggets fan but any time you call any player on that team below average on r/Denvernuggets I get downvoted into the ground. There is literally no one else on that team Jokic had to play with. As much as people hate to admit it MPJ is not that guy. He disappears in the playoffs. I got in a heated argument the other day just talking about a fun daydream of trading MPJ, Aaron Gordon, and will Barton for Dame. Some dude called me a moron for giving up 3 super important pieces for 1 guy. Those 3 super important pieces sure disappeared when it mattered the most. Idk man I’m just ranting but I wish some of ours fans would get their heads out of their ass."
Joe Harris is having the worst playoff series since Aaron Gordon against the Suns
Harden looking like Aaron Gordon out there
"They got swept lmao. They still had MPJ, Aaron Gordon and a bunch of solid role players and couldn't even steal a game. KD would have taken that team to at least a game 6"
"He is Aaron Gordon with a much better handle and a better body. That's it. Gordon has a better catch and shoot stroke with no confidence...just like Ben. Oh yeah, Ben can pass. So can Fultz. Both can average 12 points a game."
The fuck ? Do you even watch booker ? And he actually hits those shots at a good percentage. Tatum is has shit percentages in the mid range.   You saw that mid ranger he hit early in the game against Aaron Gordon in game 4
"What are your thoughts on Aaron Gordon?   I had high hopes for him in the postseason, but he was unable to establish his presence or develop a rhythm offensively.   Late in Game 4, there were stretches where you could see him trying to generate offence but unable to buy a bucket."
Aaron Gordon might honestly be the worst nba player in the league
Let me get you the rest of the way there.   It’s still a lot better than what the Nuggets would be without Jokic. Unless you’re saying Tobi and Simmons aren’t better than MPJ and Aaron Gordon.
They wish he was Aaron Gordon in the half court lol
"Aaron gordon has a jumper, below average but he shots midrange shots"
Is he as useless as Aaron Gordon was or more?
No.  But you get Aaron Gordon
"Aaron Gordon is that guy that sends you 15 Xbox Party invites for Fortnite and the moment you go ""Okay, where we landing?"" You realize that the bus auto dropped him cause he's off texting and making a ham sandwich"
"I have said it on my sub a few times now, and I probably expect to get downvotes for it, but I don't understand the Aaron Gordon hype at all for Denver and as a player in general.  He is a career 13 PPG scorer, 32% shooter from three and averages 2.5 ast per game.  This is not a small sample size, he has been in the league 7 seasons now and is what he is, which is ...   Not a great offensive player, basically below league average at everything on that side of the ball except dunks.  He can't get his own shot and can't playmake for others.  His post moves are not strong, didn't get to the foul line a ton, and when he does shoots below 70% there.   He is a good defender, but at the time of this trade tons of talking heads were really playing up the move, Jokic and Murray can really ""unlock him""... And again I just didn't see it then or now with or without Murray.  If Jokic, the league MVP and one of the best passers / playmakers in the league can't get you involved and you just continue to hang on the perimeter and brick jumpers, then I am not sure what anyone else can do to unlock your game offensively."
I think it shows that both Ayton and Book are significantly better players than Aaron Gordon - which isn’t as much a knock on Gordon as both those young Suns are studs.
"No idea why this is the most upvoted take. We typically *dont* play drop because drop puts more pressure on his lack of footspeed/lateral agility.  Typically we play him at the level and have him hedge up to try to force the ball away from the ball handler. He’s also got good enough hands to disrupt passing lanes. The problem is that means we need to rely on weak side rim protection, usually from our 4, like Aaron Gordon. But we were getting killed on lobs to ayton, especially when we had Gordon manning up on booker (because all of our guards are unavailable).  So it seems like in the “pick your poison” scenario, we decided to let them have the midrange all day in hopes that perhaps some of those would rim out. The alternative is to play hedge and hope that the ball handlers can’t make the reads/passes or that the secondary ball handlers they outlet to can’t reverse it back to take advantage of any defensive rotations. The suns absolutely can. And they have a big who will punish you rolling if you do.  All in all, given our roster limitations, I think it was probably the best we could hope for/ask for. Suns are a tough team. Any time you can put the other team in a lose/lose scenario, you’re doing something right. And if they just don’t have the personnel to counter it and adjust to it? Gonna be a short series. Like we saw here."
Aaron Gordon has enter the chat
"The Denver Nuggets were 13-3 before the playoffs and were playing some of their best basketball WITHOUT MURRAY. Though I do agree that they would definitely be a much better team with Murray, it wasnt as if they were a lottery team before the playoffs, especially after they got Aaron Gordon.  Fans should just appreciate what the Suns have done:  ""The Suns are in the midst of one of the most dominant stretches in recent playoff memory. They are the only team to take a 20-point lead in 5 straight playoff games in the last 25 seasons. They've led by double-digits 58% of the time during that span.""  7 straight playoff wins by an Average of DOUBLE DIGITS IN THE PLAYOFFS should be impressive regardless of who they were playing. The fact that they did it over the defending champs with one of the best defenses on the NBA even without one of AD or LeBron and a sweep over the no 3 team in the West with this year's MVP amd one of the best records going into the playoffs WITHOUT JAMAL MURRAY, is something that should be recognized and not placed with quotation marks or labelled ""mickey mouse"" etc...the Suns are playing beautiful basketball right now and I hope the next generation of basketball youngsters get to learn from these Suns because thats how basketball should be played...  Heres to the Suns first Championship :-) Go Suns!!!!"
what aaron gordon does to a mf
"We had like what, eight or so games post-trade deadline with all our starters?  And it was amazing. Beautiful basketball, everything looked great. Nuggets looked terrifying. Those same guys ragging on Aaron Gordon now were singing his praises then.   And then it went up in flames. Injuries suck... Oh well, our guys are young and talented, and there's a good mentality around our team for hard work. I believe they'll be back better than ever next year."
Aaron Gordon sure is good.
He was always ass even on the Magic. No idea why people think Aaron Gordon was ever good
An Aaron Gordon that didn't regress in every conceivable way probably would've been helpful
Is Aaron Gordon any good? I watched them play a lot with him this year and expected a lot more. Id rather have kept Gary Harris and RJ Hampton than whatever he provided
"Denver was 13-3 before the playoffs and looked like a juggernaut WITHOUT MURRAY. they beat a good Denver team fair and square which just beat a healthy Portland Trailblazer team. Dwnver had a good team when they faced the suns, especially when they picked up Aaron Gordon. They were beaten an AVERAGE of 18 ppg in 3 straight playoff games With MVP Jokic balling out.   Monty just outcoached them and together with James Jones, put together a COMPLETE roster that could run his offensive and defensive schemes.   7 Straight playoff games is also an unreal streak. At some point in time, youre going to have to respect the style of basketball they have been putting on the floor, both offense and defense, against anybody, whether it be Lebron and AD, who they beat fair and square in Game 1, or against MVP Jokic who they swept (Jokic flagrant came in the 3rd qtr... He made a mental mistake and shouldn't have tried winding up to swipe the ball in the first place... So he should be also faulted for putting himself in a positon to be thrown out of the game). The type of basketball they play is beautiful and that is something that demands our respect. Go Suns!!!"
"Leave homeless people out of this, they've got greater problems than being compared to what Aaron Gordon has become."
"They made the big trade for Aaron Gordon and it backfired tremendously. He stinks out loud. Good coaching can't change some players. Also, MPJ turned into old MPJ. Getting cooked defensively and his ability offensively can't overshadow how bad he is on defense."
Aaron Gordon would be working at Raising Canes if it wasn’t for the 2016 dunk contest
&gt;I don’t give a fuck who did it  99% of people wouldn’t have cared if it was Aaron Gordon who did this.  This is a textbook flagrant 2. People will come around when the emotions aren’t so high.
"heads up Nugget bros. excited to see what more rest, a healthy Murray, and fully integrated Aaron Gordon can accomplish."
Aaron Gordon
"Tonight's ejection aside (dumb), it's not as if he was stinking up the joint. His supporting cast was only slightly better than mops being propped up by folding chairs. Aaron Gordon has been replaced by a homeless person and you can't convince me otherwise."
Aaron Gordon is seriously just a non contributing useless player.  A glorified dunker that's all.
Bad defense or no Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers will never have another series or even stretch of games like that. Monte Morris too but he’s decent.  I literally don’t think Aaron Gordon could shoot better in practice wide open than he did in the series.
Aaron Gordon kinda disapointing this series. Guy shit the bed.
Aaron Gordon is either useless on defense or completely gassed and gave up the last minute or so
Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon doesn’t even know how to intentionally foul
Aaron Gordon was out here making a wish list of teams to be traded to just to contribute nothing but cardio in the playoffs.
Aaron Gordon getting blown by and outrebounded by Booker get that son of a bitch out of Denver man LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
"Oh yea, Aaron Gordon plays for Denver 😂"
Aaron Gordon has regressed to his rookie days.
I though Aaron Gordon was good
Well Aaron Gordon can go back to whining about the dunk contest now
bruh wasn't Aaron Gordon a borderline superstar on Orlando?
Aaron Gordon is fuckin useless
This is where Aaron Gordon can prove his worth and... yeah
Aaron Gordon shoulda listened to that player who gave that speech in the lockerroom to step it up
Aaron Gordon has played exactly like a dude who would make a documentary about losing the slam dunk contest
What da Dog* doin  * ^aaron ^Gordon
Jerami Grant 10 billion times better than Aaron Gordon. JG&gt;AG
"Remember when Aaron Gordon was the push the Nuggets needed haha? Shame Murray went down, they need him."
Like what happened to Aaron Gordon? Are we sure he's even still alive?
Aaron Gordon with 6 points is fuckin embarrassing     He gets too many touches to have 6 fuckin points
What is Aaron Gordon doing lmao
Aaron Gordon Fucking Sucks
Aaron Gordon is trash lmfao
Aaron Gordon 1/6  THIS GUY
Aaron gordon should take 0 iso jumpers
Aaron Gordon has been disappointing. I wished Murray was healthy. Jokic needs help and spacing.
Aaron Gordon sucks
What the actual fuck is Aaron Gordon doing
Aaron Gordon is not very good
"Aaron Gordon is one of my favourite players, and I wrote a post about him just a few days ago.  He has been solid defensively but completely absent on the offensive end and the Nuggets need additional scoring to win this game."
"No, this happens more than you think. Aaron Gordon is just more of a household name due to the dunk contest."
I can't believe they traded a young Gary Harris for Aaron Gordon.  HUGE L
Bruh Aaron Gordon is so frickin ass lol
I forgot Aaron Gordon was on the Nuggets
I’m still waiting for Aaron Gordon to bust out a JR Smith 360-windmill against the Heat.
Aaron Gordon gonna look great catching lobs from Jimmer Fredette in Shanghai
I guess Aaron Gordon being invisible wasn't the fault of the Magic.
Did Aaron Gordon lose some athleticism
"You can describe Aaron Gordon with the same grant description lol, its not working too well I would say"
Aaron Gordon being lazy. Jae was his man once MPJ was beaten off the dribble.
"Magic fans, can Aaron Gordon score?"
How bad has Aaron Gordon been from a scale of bad to terrible?
Aaron Gordon is so bad.
You know it's bad when Aaron Gordon has to create off the dribble...
Is Aaron Gordon good at basketball??
"I love it when I see Aaron Gordon out there, makes the game feel like its 6 on 4"
"TBF sometimes Aaron Gordon will do something to kill your momentum too, offensive foul usually"
Torrey Craig &gt; Aaron Gordon 😒
I'm a neutral fan that doesn't really care who wins.  And I'm frustrated that Aaron Gordon sucks so much.
"I’m always amazed when pros can’t use their left hand when it’s crucial to do so. Left handed layup Aaron Gordon scores, righty layup it’s an easy block"
The best Suns player is Aaron Gordon
Look. I love Aaron Gordon because I’m a huge UA fan.   But I’m loving watching him shit the bed
Aaron Gordon getting punked by BOSSMAN99
Aaron Gordon has such low Basbetball IQ. My goodness
Aaron Gordon should have dunked that anyways
We got Aaron Gordon cause we lost jerami grant.
That’s exactly why they got Aaron Gordon
He was traded to the Magic along with RJ Hampton for Aaron Gordon
"Aaron ""Christopher Claus Andersen"" Gordon"
"This is so stupid lol they still had the league MVP, Aaron Gordon, and Michael Porter. That should've been enough to at least win a home game. You guys act like it was Jokic and absolutely nobody"
Aaron Gordon. Didn't do dick to help out Denver
"I’m not high on Aaron Gordon as a player since well before he went to Denver, and mpj and Jokic being sieves on defense against the exact sets that we like to run bodes well for us. Jamal isn’t fixing what we did to them in the pnr.   We split the two healthy games during the regular season then they beat us in double ot without book. And it’s the regular season. Those games don’t mean anything lol. I still take us over the nuggets for sure."
"&gt;t to the 2nd round with Austin Rivers, an undrafted 30yr old rookie, newly aquired Aaron Gordon, young MPJ, and Jokic. Bench was diminished due to Will Barton &amp; Dozier also being hurt. Ta  tbf they had a hobbled CP3 for the two games that the Lakers won"
"They are definitely good enough. They got to the 2nd round with Austin Rivers, an undrafted 30yr old rookie, newly aquired Aaron Gordon, young MPJ, and Jokic. Bench was diminished due to Will Barton &amp; Dozier also being hurt. Take Devin Booker off the Suns, and have them play a Nuggets team with Murray. Probably be a sweep as well. Nuggets way overachieved for what they had."
Aaron gordon baby
"Offense: G Jamal Murray, G Monte Morris, F Will Barton, F MPJ, C Nikola Jokic  Defense: G PJ Dozier, G Shaq Harrison, F Aaron Gordon, F Paul Millsap, C Javale???"
I think there's a big difference between the firsts of a team like Charlotte vs Denver. Denver thinks they can win a title right now Charlotte is still building and draft picks are their only real way of potentially acquiring young viable talent. PJ Washington at 2 yrs left on a dirt cheap deal I would also consider a flat out better trade asset than the ever overrated Aaron Gordon in general.   If you protect the picks enough you might do it. But zero chance I would give up some lightly protected firsts and PJ for Sabonis if Im Char.
"Charlotte would. That's an absolute steal.   A young, salary-controlled All-Star in Sabonis for 2 firsts and a role player?  They'd be getting an All-Star in Sabonis for a similar price to what Denver just paid for Aaron Gordon."
"Thought it was pretty clear it's my opinion because the term super team doesn't actually have a definition. That said, the media and fans only flip about these teams when they're built in one offseason. The Nuggets aren't ever going to be polarizing if Jokic, Murray, MPJ and Aaron Gordon all become all stars."
Oh that’s good to know.  I know Bob used to be big on Aaron Gordon. Any chance Mavs try to trade for him?
"I've thought about this time-share idea a lot  Basically the Nuggets and Bucks need to come up with a list of guys that make 2 Supermaxes worth of money to get banished to the Shadow Realm of getting traded for Giannis and Jokic every year  Aaron Gordon and Lopez are obvious candidates due to redundancy, but I have a hard time figuring out how to do it without one of Middleton, Jrue, Murray, MPJ getting stuck in the Shadow Realm. Probably no way to do it tbh. I guess MPJ can just get a max and shoot a lot on a bad team lol"
"Look at that Nuggets roster and tell me that Jokic is the main reason they can't keep up on D. Trading for Aaron Gordon was a good move, but he can't do *all* the work. MPJ is an *abysmal* defender, and the Nuggets backcourt was small even *before* the starters got hurt."
"Seems a bit greedy, he's not the hottest commodity right now with 2-3 years of being continually injured and he's a tough roster fit for a lot of teams. Why not try to win a chip and dominate with Denver?  Maybe doesn't like the new Aaron Gordon / MPJ situation"
"Dame for Jamal Murray + Aaron Gordon  Nuggets don't lose their 2 year window before MPJ hits RFA, Blazers get a really good young player who is basically going to miss 2 years which gives them an automatic tank  It fixes the biggest problem for each team: Nuggets need a guard who can run DHOs all game with Jokic and fast before MPJ gets expensive. Blazers get one of the best players under 25"
Aaron gordon
Aaron Gordon doesn't put up any stats haha  The whole reason he plays is to defend big wings
"Eric Bledsoe, CJ McCollum, Aaron Gordon, Marvin Bagley, Andre Drummond"
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
"&gt; Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Josh Richardson, Caris LeVert, Lonzo Ball  That team would be damn good as a player controlled 2k team."
"I forgot about Dozier completely, I guess that's why they had to go after Rivers.  I feel like Barton has always been out and they're use to playing without him. But agreed they were definitely short handed.   I was pretty surprised they got by without a 3 and D wing. They lost Gary Harris , Torrey Craig, and Jerami Grant! I've never considered Aaron Gordon to be a 3 and D wing but he did a good job on defense in the playoffs."
Blake griffin would have been better  Or even Aaron Gordon
"Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, and a 1st?"
Aaron Gordon is a complete bust.
"When we drafted Aaron Gordon, Hezonja, Jonathan Isaac. The picks above us, Embiid, Porzingis and Trae Young"
"Mo Bamba, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja"
"It’s down to how different websites define what a possession is — that’s why I couched it as **isn’t necessarily entirely true**. Pbpstats gives an explanation [here](https://dblackrun.github.io/2019/04/15/why-pbpstats-possession-counts-lower.html):  &gt; This season the NBA stats website started using exact possession counts instead of the estimate they had previously used. While exact counts had previously been available on some smaller sites, including my site, PBPStats, it was good to see what I would assume is the most visited site for NBA stats finally use exact counts. If you have compared numbers on the NBA site and on PBPStats you have probably noticed that the possession counts are different. How can the counts be different if both are using exact counts? Well it turns out defining a possession is not as simple as one might think. I will use game 1 of the Raptors Magic series to show a few examples of this.  &gt; At the end of the second quarter Danny Green makes a three with 0.4 seconds remaining. Orlando inbounds the ball to Aaron Gordon who fails to get a full court shot off before the buzzer sounds. Should this count as a possession for Orlando? Their percentage chances of scoring here are probably in the low single digits so does it make sense to count it the same as we would count a normal mid-quarter possession with a 24 second shot clock.  &gt; At the end of the third quarter Pascal Siakam misses a corner three. In the play-by-play Michael Carter-Williams is credit with a rebound with one second remaining in the quarter. Does that mean Orlando gets credited with a new possession after the rebound? As you can see from the video, it would take a miracle for them to score after the rebound.  &gt; At the end of the fourth quarter Kawhi Leonard missed a three pointer that would have tied the game and the ball went out of bounds with 0.5 seconds remaining. Orlando just needed to inbound the ball and have time expire to win the game. Should this be counted as a possession for them?  &gt; If you look at the stats for this game on the NBA site it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 99 possessions. On PBPStats it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 96 possessions. I don’t know exactly how possessions are counted on the NBA site, but the most logical guess I can make is the three possession difference is because the three examples above are all counted as possessions for Orlando. None of them are counted on PBPStats. Any possession that starts with two or fewer seconds remaining in a quarter isn’t counted as a possession, unless points are scored. I arbitrarily picked two seconds, but the goal was to limit counting end of quarter possessions with little to no chance of scoring.  &gt; This is why you will see the team efficiency stats 1-2 points per 100 possessions higher on PBPStats. This isn’t the only place where decisions need to be made on how to count a possession, flagrant fouls are another place (I count the free throws and possession following the free throws as two separate possessions), but it is the biggest one that would be causing most of the difference. I understand why one would count possessions the way they are on the NBA site - it’s easy to understand and easier to code, but I think not counting those end of quarter possessions give a better representation of a team’s efficiency. There is no perfect way to do it. Working with play-by-play data is always going to be messy and there will always be issues you hadn’t considered that come up. I think it’s good to have options available that make different choices and let the user decide which one makes more sense for what they are looking for."
"They’re under max contracts which is exactly why Denver won’t be able to pay MPJ, Aaron Gordon, or anyone else who’s going to demand a larger salary. Same reason why they lost Jerami Grant, because they couldn’t pay him enough to stay. Nuggets are so fucked with Jamal Murray being given a max contract."
Only a small minority of high school teams could. Like Monteverde academy and IMG probably could but there’s only so many schools like that. I played varsity basketball in the same high school league that NBA players like Aaron Gordon and Tyler Johnson played in (so this league is proven to be a very tough league) and we had a few WNBA players come to our gym to run 5’s with us and they legit dusted the varsity team. Our varsity team was better than most schools and it wasn’t even close
"Lol kawhi went through aaron gordon, ben simmons, middleton, iguodala all throughout that playoffs. Im sorry but ariza and odom aren't any better as defenders than those guys he already cooked"
AAron goRdON tH0
Zach LaVine reminding us why Aaron Gordon is so salty
didn't they switch Aaron Gordon onto him because he was getting cooked?
"Marvin bagley is from az! He actually played on the same high school team as Ayton.  James harden went to Arizona State U. Aaron Gordon, TJ McConnell, Kevin knox. There’s actually not that many"
"Campazzo, Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon works cap wise. I wonder if that would work with another first or two added.  Simmons next to Murray and Jokic would be stellar."
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, Will Barton for Dame, RoCo  Then Aaron Gordon for Norman Powell Sign and Trade"
What drug are you on bro? Aaron Gordon is not worth much.
"&gt; But I really don't know that for Denver trading Aaron Gordon straight up (in a world where the salary could be made to work) would make sense for Denver.  Gordon was pretty awful in the playoffs as well.  11 ppg, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, 50% true shooting, 10 per, 64% from the line."
Simmons is such a tough trade piece.  I thnk on paper him playing next to Jokic would be the perfect fit. Him on offense having to do nothing other than just making hard cuts to the rim and he can add the defense and rim protection that Jokic lacks.  But I really don't know that for Denver trading Aaron Gordon straight up (in a world where the salary could be made to work) would make sense for Denver.  That would just complicate the cap so much unless the Nuggets were willing to pay a huge Luxury tax bill once MPJ got his new contract.  Simmons is just such a hard piece in a trade because he does good things but also destroys a team's spacing.
Kenyon Martin----Aaron Gordon(there isnt a great one for this)  Keith Van Horn---Bojan Bogdanovic/Tobias Harris   Kerry Kittles----Will Barton  Richard Jefferson----yeah I guess Bridges isnt bad
Did u just slip Aaron Gordon in their lol
"I don't know. Wouldn't you consider guys like Nurkic or Myles Turner as middle class big men ? Aaron Gordon, Steven Adams, Capela, Al Horford ...  These all feel like middle class bigs."
"players who get wishfully compared a lot to Draymond Green because they are pretty skilled, they look like they are too small to play center a lot but center is still probably/aspirationally their best position, and if you squint hard they seem like maybe they could be multi-position defenders  Tier 1 - Draymond Green, ΟG Anunoby, Ben Simmons  Tier 2 - Onyeka Okongwu, Daniel Theis, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson, Robert Covington, PJ Tucker  Tier 3 - Grant Williams, DJ Wilson, JaMychal Green"
"Jokic, look at his help this year, inexperienced mpj and aaron Gordon who played like trash in nuggets uniform and a bunch of other bums. I think the bucks would be better if you swapped him and giannis"
We couldn’t get Zion? John Collins would have been good too? Aaron Gordon? Just somebody who can crash the glass.
Herro is way too much of a zoomer. Same with Aaron Gordon.
"i mean why would GSW want this. it seems like theres other players that would fit with this team so much better.  They're essentially booklyn style, all in on offense. But they will have less size and defense. Wouldn't they rather have someone like aaron gordon or even derozan for less assets and use the remaining assets for role players"

Nobody really cares about the slam dunk award but Aaron Gordon won the internet with that.
Don't forget as a judge he screwed Aaron Gordon out of a slam dunk contest win to pump up Heat player Derrick Jones Jr.
Aaron Gordon
"Aaron Gordon, he has all the tools to be great."
Notable snubs from notable snubs being Myles Turner and Aaron Gordon sounds about right. I'd add Wiggins to that group.
Except wr haven't been rebuilding.  The problem was we had teams trying to compete for the playoffs since about 2016 and failing miserably.  No team rebuilding hires Scott Skiles to be coach.  No team rebuilding hires Frank Vogel or Steve Clifford.  Those are teams trying to compete.  So no you are wrong we haven't been rebuilding we've been poorly constructing teams trying to compete.  This is the first real rebuild since we drafted Aaron Gordon.
AG- Aaron Gordon?
Aaron Gordon in mix
"Lonzo was decent, just extremely overhyped. Never deserved to be picked number 2 and have those expectations weighed on him (an opinion I’ve held since before draft night). It amazes me more ppl didn’t see his game right out of college just wasn’t ready to be a contributor night in and night out, at least until he changed his jumper.   Ingram was always good, don’t know where you’re getting that notion from. It was just a matter of us waiting for him to fill into his body.   Randle was the same beast, different animal. Had all the potential to be great, just made a bunch of boneheaded decisions and settled for jumpers too much. As he got better at shooting and decision making (more time in the league), he made different jumps in his game.  Just from watching, all of those players had a much different feel to the game than kuzma. He’s much more likely to trend on the Aaron Gordon track of progression than what those other guys did"
"Also helps explain why so many players in FVV’s position at time of draft will not have a career 10% as good.   He’s a favored draft comparison because his strengths on court are not very flashy. I always like to stress that what makes FVV good for his team is actually not his strengths but his relative lack of weaknesses. He is not exploitable on defense, not trappable, can shoot off the dribble, is willing to spot up, will make cuts, will push in transition, will help defend in smart ways. This is also true of Aaron Gordon, another player who will get 36 minutes every game but people just don’t talk about because so few qualities stand out.  He’s obviously not good because of 2 extremely specific skills, he’s good because he’s trying really, really, really hard compared to NBA players. Maybe he’s also an example of outlier cardio, like Steph is or Stockton was, which doesn’t figure as prominently. But if you see someone compared to FVV in the draft (this is equally true about Bam for centers), it’s usually because people don’t understand why FVV ever made it off the bench."
"Not necessarily true. A lot of people were warning about Wiggins bust potential. For example this guy had Wiggins and Jabari #7 and #8, behind guys like Embiid (obviously), Smart, Aaron Gordon, Nurkic, Capela, etc.  https://deanondraft.com/2014/06/26/mega-board/"
Aaron Gordon was in fact a trade
"Saying “athletic primes” in the mid to late 20’s isn’t 100% correct.   Most players are at their peak performance in their late 20’s, but that’s largely because their skill has improved a lot more than their athletic ability has declined.   Look at a player like Aaron Gordon, he was 20 during his dunk competition and jumping out of the gym. He definitely isn’t as explosive now as he was back then. Also injuries can happen, so a lot of people’s peaks don’t necessarily align with major sporting events. This was an athlete at the top heading into an Olympics, definitely a chance she isn’t on top anymore come 2024."
"Which is why LMA signed with SA in the first place right...big market?   Also the guy above you pointed to Pau gasol, marvin williams and teague. Obviously BKLYN got the big names because they had the best chance to win the title a couple months ago. Same shit was happening to the Warriors, Spurs and other championship contenders.   I forget, but how did Nuggets get Rivers and Aaron Gordon? Was that a trade?"
"PJ Dozier, Aaron Gordon, Bol Bol, Barton, 2 FRP, 1 pick swap for Simmons and Shake Milton.   Nuggets go with Monte/Murray/MPJ/Simmons/Jokic. Bench of Facu/Shake/Nanji/Green. Not bad"
"Right. He’s a finesse player, so it’s not really surprising that he can hit a 3, or that he has great touch.   It’d be more surprising if a power athlete like Aaron Gordon had great touch even tho if he’s considerably smaller than Boban."
"Aaron Gordon, Will Barton and.a 1st"
Only the ones without Aaron Gordon
"Cause I see Barnes becoming Aaron Gordon 2.0, they play identical"
"kemba walker, Joe ingles, Michael Carter Williams, Aaron Gordon, Kevin love"
"Yes, but they play nothing alike, especially when both of them were 19. Watch more Barnes tape man. The fact you didn’t even know he played point means you should really watch some more. Barnes is like Aaron Gordon"
Unless Aaron Gordon is in it. That is must-see TV
"Barnes is so bad offensively though. There were times in college where, he’s clearly the most talented on the court, but just refused to take over the game. He’s very very pass-first with little offensive game other than rim-running. Siakam is a poor comp imo, he’s more of an Aaron Gordon / Draymond type - defensive playmaking 4 with little offensive game other than athleticism  I like Barnes’ defensive versatility like he can legitimately guard 1-5. But yall overrating his offence, there’s a reason he came off the bench in college and wasn’t a starter"
"Agree with this one... Nowadays i am too looking forward more to the 3 point shoot out and not that lame dunk contest..  Note: when i am still a kid up to college days, my fave NBa all star event is the Slam dunk contest but since entering 2010's the only exciting dunk contest i have watched are the Aaron Gordon vs Zach Lavine and the other Aaron Gordon dunk where d wade gave him a 9 score"
"Hill only started 5 games the year before his trade, he wasn't a big deal. Probably around the same level as Boucher.  I promise you're in the playoffs. Obviously no one is beating the nets, but playoffs. You run out Siakam, Lowry, OG, FVV... who has a better roster? Bucks and Nets are locks, after that it gets debatable.  Aaron Gordon just went for a 1st and he's twice the price. Plenty of teams would like a stretch big with some rim protection. The Clippers would love that.  Take what lands to you, if it's Suggs/Green move Lowry. That team is probably a 5-6 seed. Far better than another year of lottery and the risk of having your stars get upset. Or trade next years first and move up a spot. not competing can be a real killer especially to a small market."
"https://youtu.be/d2iDnKPyxvw  Right about the 5min mark.   Plus, the injury occurred on a drive, a fairly common basketball play. It didn't matter if it was Ingles guarding him or Wesley Matthews/Aaron Gordon."
"Aaron Gordon did too, but unfortunately there were only one of him"
I took a class with Aaron Gordon and the professor literally went over the test in a study session before-hand. (It was a science credit people took for the required credit). Easiest A I've ever gotten.
Aaron Gordon
"Having Murray back doesn’t help the Nuggets defense. I said it at the start of the year, but losing Grant and Craig really weakened their defense, and while Aaron Gordon helps make up the difference, they lost another great perimeter defender in Gary Harris. They’ve gotta sure up that end of the floor before I could hypothetically say they beat the Suns healthy"
"&gt; Who would you rather have for a dunker: Prime Blake Griffin or Prime Aaron Gordon  Griffin, because he could do it better in game."
MPJ was hurt lol and Aaron Gordon was trash   Also Giannis still had Middleton who was an all star and Malcolm Brogdon shot 50/40/90
"Millsap, Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon is still a better supporting cast than Matthews, Ilyasova, Bledsoe"
Aaron fucking Gordon
You think they’re better without him ? They were just really good after the Aaron Gordon move. If they still had Murray they would have been even better.
"I remember how hyped all those guys were, especially Wiggins and Parker at 1 and 2, I remember both Wiggins and Parker had sick ass mixtapes with the most epic sounding beats that year.   I was a freshman in high school that year and Aaron Gordon was a senior at my school and was like the 4th-6th ranked player in the class. The harrison twins were ranked either just above or below him and my school traveled to the houston area and played them in a game that was on ESPN.  Embiid, Randle, and Wiggins are definitely doing the best out of the top picks from that year but i have faith my guy AG can add to his offensive game this summer and the nuggets would be strong contenders to be at the top of the west along with my warriors hopefully."
You would probably move Aaron Gordon for a shooter too in that scenario
I think Siakam lack of a consistent 3 pointer would force the Nuggets to find more perimeter players which is hard when you are cap stuck. Plus that would force Aaron Gordon to move to the bench because you can't have him and Siakam out at the same time.
But what about Aaron Gordon of the Oakland Soldiers?🤔
"Take Aaron Gordon as an example for the going rate of those style of players - RJ Hampton (a rookie, so essentially a FRP), a future first and Gary Harris (expiring who can potentially be flipped into another FRP).   Gordon's a better defender but Barnes is a better scorer."
"No argument. Tyreke is more talented but I would say on the flip that Evans can't do what Gordon can do for a contender which is be the best on the floor at something. In this case Defense. Its really funny having such a back and forth about Aaron Gordon and Tyreke Evans of all people, haha."
"Tyreke evans is very similar to Gordon bc they were both the second second option of fringe playoff teams. Tyreke evans for the 2014-2015 pelicans and Aaron Gordon for the 2018-2019 magic. Aaron Gordon is a 4th option for the nuggets and evans would most likely be that too for teams like nuggets. I just put evans above Gordon bc evans was capable of being really good on a bad team. Even on a bad team, Gordon was never that good. Evans on Memphis was a 19/5/5 guy on above average efficiency and on the kings he had a rookie year of 20/5/6 on above average efficiency. That’s something Gordon could not do even tho he had the reigns to do so on a terrible magic team."
"Blazers jump at that, don't really see why Denver does it though.  &gt; Gordon/Jokic/Dame sounds like it can compete with the top of the top,  Did we really just include Aaron Gordon in there?  He's a role player, nothing to build around."
"Slightly, yes. Aaron Gordon I'd say is probably the 4th best player on a title team, and that's still a damn good player, but based on his early returns and physical tools I thought he'd be an even better player than he is.  Aaron Gordon's best season was back in 2018-19 when he averaged 16.0/7.4/3.7, and while the efficiency wasn't great(53.8 TS%) he was still only 23, so I had expected that he'd get more efficient as he got older and more experienced. Turns out that did not happen."
"I may be missing something but how would they have a depleted roster if hypothetical they traded Murray and MPJ. They would still have Aaron Gordon as a solid 3 option. They still have Barton , Campo, and Morris. It does accelerate their timeline for sure but Dame and Jokic offensively could keep up with the elite teams in the West. They would also be able to add talent through the draft as well if they traded Murray and MPJ I doubt they would have to include many draft picks. They can find low level 3D players in FA to fill out their roster. Denver is competitive enough to attract veteran FA"
"1. They were 13-5 without Jamal  2. They had the MVP 3. They won their first round matchup against a healthy 6 seed  Those 3 things, none of which are dependent on Jamal Murray, clearly showed that the Nuggets were a legit top seed and second round playoff team. You could even include MPJr’s progression and getting Aaron Gordon. That team without Jamal isn’t far off in terms of talent and production from the Sixers, especially when Simmons no shows. The Nuggets without Jamal are a harder second round matchup than many teams get.   Cool, I’m not saying none of that didn’t happen. I’m saying you’re insane if you think the Suns have had an easy, or even dumber historically easy, wcf run. Like complete lack of knowledge about basic NBA history."
Just having Murray makes it so we don't start Campazzo and don't depend so much on Aaron Gordon to produce. I might be biased but i think we have a chance
"Nah Fournier is way worse than Barnes. Fournier is literally one of worst playoff performers I've seen. He has averaged 11-1-2 on 37% FG% and 30% 3P% while playing 30 minutes. Those are abysmal offensive stats and that doesn't even factor in his bad defense. Fournier has made a living scoring and handling the ball on bad teams during the regular season.    Barnes on the other hand was a starter on a title team. He is a better defender, he has better length, he's more efficient and he provides you more lineup versatility. Barnes does pretty much everything better than Fournier and can fit into any team seamlessly.   Look at the return Aaron Gordon got, 2 late firsts is not unreasonable for Barnes. Big wings like him are more valuable to contenders than (inefficient) scoring guards. Also Fournier went for 2 2nds because he was expiring. Barnes has years on his deal. If anyone gives Fournier 60 or 70 million this offseason they're making a big mistake."
Jamal murray Aaron Gordon and picks... plz
next dunk contest: LaVine jumps through a phone to dunk it. Aaron Gordon gets snubbed again.
"The Trade would be Simmons + Thybulle + Maxy + 3 firsts + 2 swaps. No team can outright beat that offer. It'll be about what that FO values. Sure they could prefer Aaron Gordon and Jamal Murray, that's totally possible but not every FO would. BEcause the 76ers need to make a deal and have the pieces to offer a highly competitive one it should surprise no one if that deal materializes.   &amp;#x200B;  Portland would probably end up trading CJ, or hoping he plays next season as he did the start of this season and Portland is a favorite to make the playoffs. **They could offload Nurk to the Nets for Dinwiddie in a sign and trade.** Makes better sense with Simmons."
"Four? Jokic… Murray assuming he comes back looking the same and even then calling him max level is debatable right now because he’s so wildly inconsistent… MPJ himself assuming he a) stays healthy and b) gets better… Who else? Aaron Gordon? Barton?  They don’t need Dame specifically, it could be anybody who improves their chances of winning for the next 3-4 years over hoping everything goes perfectly and you get a decade-long window with Jokic/Murray/MPJ. Just in general, youth shouldn’t be a factor for teams ready to win right now and how “cheap” they other is an issue for owners, not armchair GMs."
Aaron Gordon
&gt; Kyle Anderson is better than Aaron Gordon  What?
"Suspiciously not advocating his team be the one to trade these picks. But hey, if you wanna side with the guy who think Brooks is as good as Aaron Gordon and Marcus Smart then go ahead."
Aaron Gordon got traded for basically two 1sts.  There is no way in hell Dillon Brooks on a 2/$24M contract isn’t getting the same return or equivalent value.
"Kyle Anderson is better than Aaron Gordon (and he went for two firsts).  Im not convinced this isn’t Memphis just shopping for an overpay.  Celtics, Warriors, Suns.  There’s capped out teams that could definitely offer the equivalent value of 2 firsts for him."
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
Aaron Gordon is just Pascal Siakam drafted into a worse situation.
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
"I think (hope) the more likely scenario is finding upgrades via trade and signing some B-listers.   The last time the Pistons had this much cap space, they used it on Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, and spare parts, including broken down, twilight versions of Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins. *(They also let Sheed and McDyess walk, and traded away Aaron Afflalo &amp; Amir Johnson for basically nothing - Fabricio Oberto, whom they immediately cut, and a second round pick. That off-season was an absolute disaster.)*"
Aaron Gordon has 1.1M
Does Aaron Gordon nail the dagger in this game?
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about that. There aren’t many good free agents available and the projected cap increase is going to mean that teams have money.   I just looked at available 2022 free agents and outside of James Harden (PO), Bradley Beal (PO), Kyrie Irving (PO), and Zach LaVine, Terry Rozier might arguably be the best unrestricted free agent available. The only guys he’s really competing with is Aaron Gordon. It’s a pretty empty free agent class. Everyone is just re-signing with their original teams.   **TL,DR:** There aren’t many good free agents next year. Outside of Harden, Beal, Irving, and LaVine, Terry Rozier might be the best UFA available. His only real competition is Aaron Gordon."
"Aaron Gordon: Leap/ Dunk Leandro Barbosa: Explosiveness Jose Calderon: P&amp;R Andrei Kirilenko: Random quintuple double potential  Actually, overseas players are fun to examine in this light because by definition they're scouted because they have at least some elite developed ability.  But Peja... what a great pick! Classic ""the more it'll hurt, the bigger the chance I'll make it"" kind of guy...   oddly, a common trait amongst european legends.."
"I honestly doubt the Suns are that high again. I’m thinking the nuggets take the 2nd or 3rd seed if Murray comes back healthy, but regardless jokic carries them pretty well, plus a full year / training camp with Aaron Gordon should help and MPJ might take another leap"
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"""How much do you have to gameplan against them"" ""How much do they stress your defense by how they operate"" are getting at the same things which is what he means and which matter alot.  It's a big part of why you get so many players where the idea of the player exceeds the actual reality of them. Lonzo Ball/Aaron Gordon/Caris LeVert syndrome. Sound good on paper but you just dont ever feel their presence and they do nothing that actually stresses an opponent or makes you really account for them."
"&gt;Jokic just got Aaron Gordon this year and Gary Harris has been washed the last 3 years. Talent wise they are similiar but lets not act like KAT didnt play with some solid players. Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.   He had Paul Millsap who was very good until last year and the perfect partner for him in the frontcourt and Gary was good 2 years ago and okay 1 year ago certainly not bad players.  &gt;Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.  HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM PLAY IN MINNESOTA? BAD DEFENCE,NO REBOUNDING,DIDN'T PASS,SCORED 20 PPG ON 54% TS. THERE IS A REASON ONLY KAT IS ON THE ROSTER STILL FROM THOSE TEAMS"
"Jokic just got Aaron Gordon this year and Gary Harris has been washed the last 3 years. Talent wise they are similiar but lets not act like KAT didnt play with some solid players. Wiggins may not hae lived  up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris."
"I absolutely believe that. All those guys I listed put up crazy numbers. He is already acting as 1A on his own team and has been for many years. He has one playoff appearance where he lost in 5 games. That team was awesome.   Also, his lack of talent around him is highly overrated. Jokic beat the Blazers in a playoff series with a much, much worse team than KAT generally has. Like two backup guards starting, a very young 2nd best player in his third year in MPJ and Aaron Gordon who, unless you really overrate, is a pretty meh number two or three guy.   Not only did he win the series, but they didn’t lose a step after Murray was injured.   KAT is always fighting for 8th seed or at the bottom 2 in the West. 1B on a championship team. Lol."
"It sounds weird but go look at a picture of KAT shirtless and you’ll see why his defense is terrible. Legitimately has not an ounce of muscle on his entire body. His legs and arms are toothpicks giving him almost no upper/lower body strength when it comes to defending centers. Jokic can at least use his big body as a deterrent against big men. It only take 2 or 3 bumps for any center to back him down. Lowry, melo, Tobias, and aaron Gordon are all players I’ve seen bully him in the post easily."
"Why is Jokic the only one who ever gets brought up in these conversations? He's not a dominant defender like Gobert or Embiid, but if you think he's below average then you need to actually watch some Nuggets game. We also had Austin fucking Rivers and a 5'8 30 year old rookie starting in the playoffs, so I think it's a little unfair to blame it all on Jokic.  You also conviently left out the fact that Aaron Gordon is also a part of this front court and is a great defender lmao.  Posts like these just remind me that most people on r/nba don't know what they're talking about."
Are we talking about the same Aaron Gordon?
"It's unlikely at this point, though not impossible.  MPJ has room to grow on defense for sure, he's already improved a lot in his time in the NBA.  But he needs to get better, ideally Jokic gets better too, and Aaron Gordon or potentially another player not yet on the team can come aboard and help shore up any weak spots.  It would be great to have a great rim protector off the bench, but we don't (and when we did, Malone didn't play him...)"
Jeremiah grant was the ideal frontcourt. And Aaron Gordon is more of a name than actual abilities.
I think Aaron Gordon helps because with Grant gone they lost their wing defender but they got rid of Gary Harris who was their best guard defender. I felt better about them when they had both last year which was enough to slow down Paul George and Kawhi
I know Aaron Gordon is more of a fake good defender than an actual good defender but I think the idea is that he helps
"Maybe 25+ easily but 6 assists? Aint no way man. His decision making, playmaking and handling is not up to that standard yet and they run the movement through Jokic and whoever their PG is whether it’s Facu or Murray. Aaron Gordon would have a better chance of averaging 6 assists IMO"
&gt;Who were those players on the Magic teams besides Fournier? Aaron Gordon? DJ Augustin? Michael Carter Williams?  When you have those kinds of shot creators  Vucevic? TRoss?
"I think Magic fans are still upset about Lowry undercutting Aaron Gordon in the Bubble. Which seems a bit petty given that it was one thing over a year ago.  Between Lowry/FVV flagrantly fouling DiVincenzo and Giannis elbowing OG in the face in the final seconds of a Raps blowout win, Raps-Bucks tends to get a bit chippy, but after 2017 and 2019 I'm hesitant to call it ""petty"". It can seem that way in hindsight because the Bucks reached the mountaintop and the Raps fell off, and aside from being annoyed with all the Giannis To Toronto rumors most of the Milwaukee fans I've talked to have been generally pleasant.  Also I'm insanely jealous that Kawhi left the first chance he got, whereas Giannis is on his way to becoming the Bucks' franchise-defining all-time great on the level of Curry, Kobe and Dirk."
"Barns would really help you guys.  I felt bad for you when Aaron Gordon went to Denver.  He would have been a way better return for Gary Tent Jr. than Norman Powell was, but I don't think Portland had the fist round pick to offer (because you sent your 2021 pick to Houston for Covington)."
Thats a pretty massive exaggeration. He was really only targeted consistently by PG and only sporadically by Aaron Gordon.
"I disagree that he needs to be “second options”’as you describe it. Draymond green is definitely not a second option but effectively functioned as the pre Durand warriors second “creator” helping to unlock their offence. klay was their second best scorer of course, but draymond was the second option for creating offence as a passer, transition, hit a head passes, short roll etc.   I think he could help unlock KP as a the mavs “second scorer” but functioning as the creator for KP as a combined second option to Luka.  Simmons + KP = second option while neither by themselves can be.  As for a nuggets, I like the fit you describe if you remove Aaron Gordon."
Most egregious of all? He gave a 9 to Aaron Gordon.   I acknowledge his abilities but never a fan of the guy.
It's mostly the Reddit hive mind and a majority of this sub is too young to have watched prime DWade so they parrot the nonsense they read here.  Wade also pissed off a bunch of casuals when Derrick Jones Jr. won the dunk contest over Aaron Gordon.
"Aaron Gordon  Not as bad as bench/out of the league, but i really thought AG was primed to be a superstar"
"Tbf, 2014 was one of the weakest drafts in a while outside of Embiid/Randle/Lavine/aaron gordon (Jokic was 42). 2013 and 2014 were always bound to be full of lottery selections that don't reflect the usual talent of top picks."
"What OG Anubody/Aaron Gordon type player could they get that would be better than Harrison Barnes? He’s not the best, but who’s available that would be an upgrade?"

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"I mean I agree Trae is fucking terrible but these werent some offensive juggernauts targeting Devin Booker either. Aaron Gordon was going at him for parts of that series despite getting swept. Clippers just went at him every time they could and they werent doing it with Paul George in a number of cases also. Booker's on ball defense is generally mostly passable but he just does alot of smaller stuff that wont always get noticed as easily to hurt a defense that adds up.   If we're going by defensive metrics both guys defensive metrics are horrible. I dont think Booker is as bad as those defensive metrics state but there's a pretty clear gap in playmaking and Booker's frequency getting to the rim has fallen off only 10% in the postseason. That's one of the clear edges he has over Trae physicality getting to the rim and finishing, if he's not getting there as much he's mitigating that advantage."
I wouldn't consider Lowry a dirty player just because of this but I did remember that Aaron Gordon foul in the air that wasn't even close to ball. That one was pretty rough.
"Disagree. (Nuggets fan bias)  Jokic does complicate the defense a bit, but most normal centers are getting played off the court in the modern game.  You can stick Jokic on the 3 and D cone of the opposite team and get away with it if there is another guy that can hang with the best offensive big / big wing.  That's why the Nuggets got Aaron Gordon to be that guy.  Jokic is going to win a championship.  He's too special and driven not to.  I just hope it ends up being with the Nuggets."
Start him ahead of that bum Aaron Gordon
Aaron gordan is actually their third option. Just beating out gordon
"What about literally everyone else on the floor for the nuggets? Their only good defender is Aaron Gordon.   Rivers, Facu, MPJ, Markus Howard, Millsap, Morris were all horrendous defensively but yeah it’s definitely all Jokic."
"Aaron Gordon was the only help he had on defense. MPJ, Rivers, Facu, Monte, even fucking Markus Howard couldnt stay in front of anyone. Only center that could do a decent job when his perimeter players can’t guard anyone would be like Gobert or Bam.   Dude has never had good defensive help unlike pretty much every other big who people consider to be good defenders."
"Oh yeah no doubt, Lebron is probably the only forward that gives him trouble in the post. Dudes like Aaron Gordon, who I think is pretty built and strong, look like little kids in front of Jrue, but LeBron makes Jrue look like a little kid"
The funny thing is that Aaron Gordon said that the team didn’t have any energy in the locker room when he was getting torched by Ayton and booker while going 2 for 10 from the floor
With his only defensive help being Aaron Gordon pretty much and his only offensive help being Barton for two games coming back from an injury

"All I know from the years I've watched, if Summer League was at all a reliable indicator, Aaron Gordon would've been a star."
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
"Not all that strange. Off the top of my head, Aaron Gordon and Larry Nance Jr have similar set up deals"
"San Jose- Aaron Gordon at 1,2,3,4, and Drew Gordon at the 5."
Aaron Gordon
"Bridges, Morant, Westbrook are my favorite in game dunkers just off how hard they go at the rim and the intensity of the slam itself. Aaron Gordon on a fast break is a solid 9/10."
"Not much, Jamaal Wilkes would replace Cliff T Robinson as the starting 4 but the only other NBA players from the Bay Area but not Oakland IIRC are Matt Barnes and Aaron Gordon"
"&gt;He's worked JJJ, Jalen Johnson, JR Smith, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Clarkson  What about J Jonah Jameson? Or Jonas Jorgenson?"
"ChrisJohnsonHoops on IG.  He's worked JJJ, Jalen Johnson, JR Smith, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Clarkson and others recently too. Not much to read into."

"Smoove and Crash were both so hype back in the day. I feel like we're missing a player like that nowadays, who's even close? Miles Bridges or Aaron Gordon are closest I guess, but they're not nearly the defenders those 2 were."
"Well maybe not all my ideas would work but I still think we have a responsibility as a society to try something. As for does capitalism make people smoke crack unironically in some cases yes. In instances where people turn to drugs to escape the banality and humiliation of the underpayed monotonous 9-5. Or when they’re born into families that have been destroyed economically in previous generations.   My friends are clowning on my Lakers right now because they think Russ equals no spacing, ballhogging, locker room diva and they think he’s gonna ruin the Lakers. I told them to keep that same energy in ten months when they say LeBron needed Westbrook to win another chip. Chicago definitely upgraded the most but I also think if Kemba is healthy the Knicks had a really good offseason too bringing back all their key contributers and upgrading from Payton and Bullock to Kemba and Fournier. I think Denver will be right back there near the top next season with Jamal Murray back and a full season with Aaron Gordon. Suns and Jazz will probably fall back to the mid tier with the Warriors back but there is a little more of an opening for top seeds with Kawhi looking like he’s gonna miss most of the season. Nets should handle Miami and Milwaukee but their depth isn’t the strongest right now which is the only thing keeping me from calling them hands down favorites. With Boston I don’t even fucking know what’s going on over there anymore. A couple years ago they seemed like the present and the future and now they seem like neither."
Not even sure you need to get Murray into the deal to beat the Sixers package.  MPJ and Aaron Gordon fits the high ceiling / low level all star criteria and leaves Portland with a still competitive team.    From the reports I have seen regarding a possible team sale I don’t think the blow it up scenario option is on the table in Portland.
Denver pretty easily can put together a better package.  They have a young high ceiling guy on cheap contract in MPJ along with Murray and Aaron Gordon.
" In no order:  PG: Simmons, Jrue, (healthy Dunn), Murray, Zo?  SG: Thybulle, Smart, Dort, Harris, Brooks   SF: Kawhi, OG, PG, Jimmy, Mikal   PF: Giannis, AD, Dray, healthy Isaac, RoCo  C: Gobert, Embiid, Bam,Turner, Capela  HM: Jakob Poeltl, Pascal Siakam, Derrick White, Aaron Gordon, Pat Bev when he’s not hacking, and Bledsoe when he tries. I think any of these guys could easily be swapped into that top 5 of their respective positions."
Aaron Gordon is probably better than Tatum and KD. Hell maybe even PJ Fucker
Aaron Gordon going to be an all star.
Aaron “2x dunk champion” Gordon
"&gt;We had the best record in the nba when Jamal went down.  is that true? i thought the jazz held it for almost the entire second half of the season. i remember them being undefeated since the aaron gordon trade when murray got hurt, but i thought they were still in third"
&gt; The ideal situation for both teams would've been a CJ for Aaron Gordon trade **two years ago**.
Aaron Gordon ain’t that guy
"It depends what you can get back in the trade. If you're brutally honest about it, Dame and CJ are an unworkable playoff backcourt together - they lack height, they lack defense, and they don't score enough (i.e. they aren't combining for 80 a night) to cover those up.  The ideal situation for both teams would've been a CJ for Aaron Gordon trade two years ago."
Garry Harris trade for Aaron Gordon
Definitely. The Aaron Gordon trade was a great move by the front office. Also having Jeff Green as a backup I'd nice because that guy can still play
I wanna see the 9s Aaron Gordon dunked after this.
"Bro they made Austin look like an elite role player, that’s already tragic enough to scrap the three guard lineup forever.  Imagine if Portland took a swing on butler or aaron gordon or any good wing when they had the chance.. they’d be real scary"
d book shooting like aaron gordon
"&gt;  they were steamrolling teams, and they beat the fully healthy Clippers in their house in that streak.  It's still mid March basketball we just pick and choose when we care about it. They had 2 games anybody cares about rolling through the Hawks and beating LAC that's it, 2. And this also includes them having embarrassing 2nd half collapses at home to Boston or vs GSW it's again the same idea of only certain games counting in the general perception and the others get dismissed or rationalized away(not referring to you or anybody in particular)  This really just comes down to what you think of Aaron Gordon and how much of a difference maker you think he is and that's just where Im not a believer at all. Idea of the player has always exceeded the reality and he's much closer to a good not great defender not someone who alone isnt going to change that much. The offense is great but I dont think its any kind of Nets situation the Nets literally had a 130 offensive rating in their first round series all 3 of their stars played its just something else. I still largely think Phx beats them in 5-6 games even with Murray"
"Well that's not true.  Miles Bridges, Lonzo, Marvin Bagley, Shump, Javale, Aaron Gordon, and more have all dropped a fair amount of rap music.  Like unless he explicitly called out Dame that is a very misleading statement and wrong assumption."
"Who would you define as starting caliber, like a Robert Covington or Aaron Gordon?"
"You're getting a lot of troll responses, but the Olympic 3x3 was really fun to watch. It's difficult because of the qualification requirements, but if USA Basketball wanted to take the men's 3x3 as seriously as they take the women's 3x3 (and I think they should), then it's definitely possible. Ideally, you'd have one taller point guard (Dejounte is a good pick), and then 2 big wings who are good one-on-one defenders (Harrison Barnes, Mikal Bridges, and Kyle Anderson come to mind), and one mobile big as a roll man who can also guard on the perimeter on switches (John Collins definitely works here, as does someone like Mason Plumlee or Aaron Gordon)."
"Harden/Irving/Durant all come off Brooklyn's books in 2022. Other big ones are Beal and Lavine. Then there's a crop of solid starters, like Valanciunas, Thad Young, Aaron Gordon, Rozier, Nurkic etc. It's a pretty big FA."
Aaron Gordon + Will Barton + Bol Bol + 1RP
"He did, but he’s a pretty big anomaly though because he’s an otherworldly talent and can not only score but pass like no other his size.  Even with his abilities, they recognized a large defense-first 4 in Aaron Gordon was vital to cover for his rim protecting deficiencies too. And they still haven’t won it"
"What free agent class?  f Brooklyn's big three extends this off-season, Zach Lavine will be the only top tier free agent available and Chicago can offer more money, a better market and a comparable winning situation.  The next tier sucks. It's pretty much Aaron Gordon, TJ Warren, Jusuf Nurkic and Marcus Smart with Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton and Jaren Jackson Jr. as restricted free agents that would almost certainly get matched."
I'd take him to the Nuggets for Aaron Gordon and a pick if it wasn't for his atrocious attitude
"Yeah I would think you have to give up MPJ and salary filler (Aaron Gordon?) to make it work, which wouldn't make sense for the Nuggets."
"Didn't they just signed Jeff Green? On top of Jamychal Green and Aaron Gordon, I feel like they just running small."
"Higher on Ben Simmons than consensus:   Once he gets out of Philly, and possibly moved to a forward spot I think he will be great. People get caught up in the circle jerk and just wanna pile on. He had a bad playoff series, yes he was very much in his head - but who put him there? People wanna talk about he's a coward for not shooting 3s, when he's watched Philly fans shitting on Embiid for shooting 3s for years and he knows he's a worse shooter. Watched them turn on Markelle. Make-a-Wish kid treatment fake cheering if he attempts a three doesn't help.  Maybe he should be ""mentally tougher"" and because he's making 170m he shouldn't have feelings. Or maybe Philly fans just suck. They aren't ride or die, they are ""what have you done for me lately"".   Lower: Aaron Gordon -   played well with a full Denver team, but I think his desire to demonstrate he's a star with send him back down the road of taking dumbass fadeaways and pullup 3s. We already started to see that when Murray went down, and I'm v sure AG is going into next season thinking he can make an All-Star bid, and taking the shots he thinks will get him there."
Aaron Gordon was robbed of the slam dunk contest. Lavine is a better player but Gordon schooled him.
Dante Exum trying to steal my heart.  Orlando should draft him head of Aaron Gordon.  Calling it now.  Exum for the 5th pick
"3 of the top 5 picks, what? Everybody watch out when Wiggins, Aaron Gordon and Dante exam team up. 2014 draft class coming!   Also, you said Bron at ‘36 and Russ at ‘32 isn’t old. But somehow Paul Pierce 32, KG 33, Ray Allen 34 and rondo 23 is old"
"yes but i don't see any trades. fine...you didn't want to get a rental of kawhi and harden didn't want to go there.  Aaron Gordon was traded.  vucevic was traded.  jonas valanciunas was traded.  did you try to do a sign and trade for derozen or anyone else?  from the outside, it looks like blazers are afraid to make a move out of fear they'll make the team worse.  blazers have been dame, CJ and nurkic with pieces.  thats good enough to make the playoffs but not much else.  morey would have blown that up 2 years ago.  Riley would have traded CJ for butler or someone else.  you are keeping Dame...thats a given but everyone else should have been on the trade block."
"It was pretty strong to end the season, but ran into a specific issue that Denver started 2 6'10 forwards and we had to put 6'3 Norman Powell on one of them... Aaron Gordon and MPJ's stats fell significantly going from the POR series to the PHO series.    There is something to be said for trying to run it back.  Hope the team is healthy most of the year, learns to play better defense, younger guys get better, Nurk/CJ in better shape.  However we badly need a SF."
"3 or 1   Would replace Marques Johnson with Iso Joe and take 5 tho.    Some others to add   Curry family   Tim Hardaway, THJ, Anfernee Hardaway  George Hill, Grant Hill, Solomon Hill   Anthony Davis, Baron Davis, Terence Davis   Ben Gordon, Aaron Gordon, Eric Gordon"
"Yeah it’s a real Aaron Gordon mentality. If he ever gets to a contender and fulfills that role, it’s gonna be great."
"Man, I don't know why my dumbass read this as Agent Aaron Gordon. Had me thinking ""Aaron Gordon is DeMar's agent?!"""
"Wait hold on, whose made the huge moves in the West?   The Lakers yes. The Nuggets yes, they added a starter in Aaron Gordon last season. The Clippers no. The Suns re-upped. And the Jazz, no, Rudy Gay and Mike Conley don't seem like they're enough to get em over the playoff hump.  I think only two teams could say they got better, with the Suns, Grizz and Mavs probably banking on internal growth to get them to the WCF/finals. Of course, the best out of these teams is the Suns."
"Drummond had the 4th most post-ups in the league with a blistering 82 ORtg on those possessions.  Sabonis was top-10 in attempts with an 84 ORtg on postups.  Westbrook, Siakam, Nurkic, Wiseman, Aaron Gordon, Kevin Love, …  All these guys were in the top-25 in post-ups per game while scoring fewer than 0.90 PPP. Absolutely awful offense.  The Blazers had one of the best offenses in the league and still posted up Nurkic on 30% of his offensive possessions with a ghastly 0.74 PPP  If teams see a small guy on a big, they go to that post up regardless of how bad the big is at posting up. They shouldn’t, but they do."
"I always think of this play when people are trying to rate NBA players as athletes but conveniently ignore anyone outside the top 50-100 players.  There are few guys stuck at the end of the bench/g-league ([like DJ Stephens, though he's in France now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WKb_j3acH8) who can outjump people like Zach Lavine or Aaron Gordon with ease- they just aren't good enough at basketball to get on the floor very often."
Vooch averaged 28/11/4 on the Bucks in their playoff series a couple years ago... the Magic's 2nd option was Aaron Gordon. He shot 40.9% on 3s on 8 attempts per game  Don't worry about vooch is all I'm saying
The Nuggets remind me a bit of how the Bucks built their team. Jokic is their Giannis and Murray is their Middleton. They gotta find their Jrue and I have a feeling that Aaron Gordon is not that guy. Hopefully MPJ can fill in the role
"This is exactly true. How many big, punishing PFs are there in the NBA anymore? Giannis and...? And how many PFs nowadays really bully the opposition like that? Maybe Julius Randle also? Aaron Gordon? I think LeBron is going to be fine. If they really need to go big occasionally, they can always put Dwight in there and slide AD and LeBron down a spot."
Would you take Aaron Gordon for Simmons straight up out of curiosity?
Except someone like Aaron Gordon can lmao. He  nowhere near top tier yet he pulled the Magic card. It’s gonna keep happening too
Aaron Gordon
"His value won’t change as long as he doesn’t play, but GM’s have different opinions on him. I’m sure some small market teams see superstar potential in him but they don’t want to pay over his current value. It’s more so teams going into tank mode that want to give away their stars. Vucevic got traded for two picks, Wendell Carter Jr and Otto Porter Jr. Aaron Gordon got traded for Gary Harris and RJ Hampton. Other players will lose value and deals will become available."
He got Aaron Gordon paid
Aaron Gordon is under Klutch
Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon.  Collin Sexton.
"I think you're maybe taking Rotation Player the wrong way. Rotation Players are like solid guys that you want on your roster. And I'm just guessing that anything Prospect is probably constrained by years in the league. They probably aren't categorizing anyone going into their 4th year as a Prospect.  Don't want to put words in your mouth. I think rotational player is probably right for him. His ceiling is definitely higher than that, but I'm guessing this is looking at his most likely scenario.   Norm Powell is also a Rotational Player. Gordon Hayward is a Rotation Player. Aaron Gordon. But so are guys like Frank Ntilikina and Derrick Jones Jr. It's a big range."
Don't think they filled the Murray void. Also I think Aaron Gordon sucks.
And Drew Gordon (brother of Aaron Gordon) lasted 9 games.
"plenty of role players have better stats playing with lebron, lot of guys are catch and shoot guys and lebron is one of the best at creating open shots for teammates.  Simple one is kcp had the 3 most efficient years of his career playing with lebron.  also ad had his best year ever with lebron in 2020 but let me guess that was all due to his own development and had nothing to do with lebron.  Ofc volume will go down when you play with lebron or a ball dominant star but that's expected whenever you move to any more talented team. You'll have the ball less and get less shots and play less minutes.    aaron gordon scored 15ppg in orlando, he scored 10ppg in denver and jokic is the absolute opposite of a ball dominant star.  Denver is fine with that too he was more efficient and shouldnt be scoring 15 on a great offensive team.  To use a great player as an example, james harden wont average even 30ppg in bkn most likely while he was putting up 35 in houston and KD isnt luka/lebron ball dominant either."
I feel like adding Aaron Gordon was the perfect move. It's just a shame Jamal went down and Aaron's role got bigger.
"Still think the Aaron Gordon sign was a bit much considering what they were gonna give the guy he replaced last year. Though if the cap is looking to go up again soon it really isn’t a problem.   Solid offseason, mostly retained players and replaced a vet for another."
"I really don’t like Aaron Gordon, but they likely were in a cap situation where they either pay him or lose him.  If I were the Nuggets, I would try to explore some Murray/Gordon for Lillard type deal…"
I like the Aaron Gordon signing. Its a lot of money but he brings a lot to the team. His defense is solid and his slashing ability is elite-ish. Im curious to see what level Jamal Murray comes back at. Hopefully MPJ continues to get better.
Every player is +/- 5     Giannis   Gobert    Embiid   AD   Draymond    Bam   Simmons   Turner   Jrue   Kawhi   Dort   PG13   Thybulle   Poeltl  Jimmy    Smart   Aaron Gordon   LeBron   Durant   Capela   Pat Bev
Because Aaron Gordon scores 8 points in an elimination game
"&gt; Facundo Campazzo - Key Role Player  &gt; Aaron Gordon - Rotation Player  lol ""30 year old rookie"" Facu has a higher rating than 90M dollar Gordon"
"FO really chose Fournier over Oladipo because they wanted better shooting next to Elfrid Payton and Aaron Gordon… we also gave up on Tobias Harris. With Oladipo, Harris and Vuc we could’ve had a decent team that would atleast be fun to watch"
"Pg: Chris Paul (all-star)  Sg: CJ McCollum  Sf: Paul George (all-star)  Pf: Kevin Durant (superstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  Bench: Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, Mikal Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Clint Capela,"
"Starters:  steph (superstar)  klay (all-star)  og anunoby  giannis (superstar)  deandre ayton (all-star)  Bench: fred vanvleet, seth curry, caris levert, michael porter jr, aaron gordon, chris boucher, brook lopez   Good combination of offense, defense, play-making, and fit imo"
We also had the 2nd best record in the league after he went down. The addition of Aaron Gordon was huge for us.
"This is why Aaron Gordon is so important to the Nuggets. MPJ and Aaron can switch roles on offense and defense. MPJ playing the 3 on offense and the 4 on defense, with Aaron doing the reverse."
"Especially because people seem to think that team dynamics/schemes stay static when they add a new player. When you add someone, you want to maximize their potential on the team while retaining what works, and sometimes the trade off for adjusting to a new players/new players is more beneficial than their ‘fit’ coming in.  Like, Aaron Gordon was an absolutely natural ‘fit’ for Denver this last season, in that not much of the team’s offensive/defensive scheme needed to be adjusted to maximize his abilities as a player.  But when it comes to adding someone like Westbrook to the Lakers, it’s not like they’re going to ask Russ to play like Schröder or be a spot up 3pt shooter while LeBron runs the offense – the payoff from adjusting the scheme to maximize his abilities has been analyzed as beneficial (this one is different bc we haven’t seen it yet, but what we do see is how many people are voicing conjecture without actually seeing how it will play out).  Maybe that was too much to explain something basic, but it irks me"
"Ingram better or he will become the next Aaron Gordon (yes i am aware Ingram is much better, im talking about the potential to reality factor)"
"This is the very obvious answer to LeBron's question btw  It's fun. Most these guys love basketball and trying to replicate a Kyrie handle, a Lillard Three, a Luka Trickshot, or an Aaron Gordon dunk is done because it's fun."
"Aaron Gordon. Going on season 8 and he’s still all potential, little refinement"
"Aaron Gordon, he's not really great at anything aside from finishing yet a lot of people treat him like a high-end roleplayer."
"But that's exactly my point. The trophy doesn't matter at all, being remembered is the real prize. When we look back at the dunk contests throughout history, who comes to mind first: Aaron Gordon or Glenn Robinson III? Does anyone give a shit that Fred Jones won a dunk contest in 2004? The trophy is literally an afterthought. If Aaron Gordon wants to be pissed that he doesn't have a decoration for his mantelpiece, he has that right but it makes him look stupid."
Found Aaron Gordon
"Aaron Gordon is (at worst) the third greatest dunk contest performer in NBA history. He might have the greatest collection of dunks ever. That being said, the fact that he whined so much about losing makes him look like a bitch. Nobody gives a fuck who wins the dunk contest, we just wanna see a good show."
at least Aaron Gordon will forever be remembered this way. Because everyone is going to remember that dunk contest and his dunks. Greatest dunk context since vince 360 windmill
"Right now its 50/50 fkk or fkl  Fuck Kyle Kuzma Fuck Kyle Lowery  We hate Kyles!   Kuzma is due to an off hand comment he made about being a no one in LA is better than being a star in Orlando, and Lowry is because of a dirty play on Aaron Gordon in the bubble playoffs where Gordon missed most of the rest of the series due to it."
"The Denver owners know how to hire good execs. Karni and Masai are former Nuggets. Denver's current pres Tim Connelly is one of the best and apparently, Nuggets GM Calvin Booth was instrumental in bringing Aaron Gordon to the team.  I'm surprised Karni isn't GM or pres yet. Or is VP higher than the GM? I dunno."
Wizards had to give up a 1st round pick to give up John wall. Let’s see what rockets have to give up to get rid of John wall.   This has nothing to do with Aaron Gordon. Idk yet if the contract is bad or just right or good.   I’m arguing with the poster saying that bad contracts can be easily traded when they really are not
yeah because aaron gordon signed a super max. and john wall did get traded so i don’t get your point.
I believe so. Similar players but aaron gordon offers just a little more. I think he guards SF's better than Grant but Grant was a better shooter where Gordon is more creative offensively
I was watching his scrimmage/training video with Ja Morant and Aaron Gordon the other day and noticed him taking a few pull up jumpers and fadeaways.  I hope so. I’m a sucker for a redemption story
"Aaron Gordon has a good handle, decent court vision, above average passer. Is strong and fluid. Gets himself open 10 ft jumpers and bricks most of them. Just an awful jump shot. Its like he is too strong to shoot normally so its all in his arms and hands and it has a super inconsistent release. Every 3 pointer he makes still somehow looks awkward. Crafty in picks, sees backdoors well, but not everytime. Finishes around the rim, and not just dunks, actually has alright touch.  If he could shoot he would be an elite offensive player, but his shot is so bad it limits his scoring, and therefore limits his gravity outside of the paint. Sometimes he got lucky and jumpers would fall in Orlando and thats why he would have these random high scoring games.   Strong and crafty in 1v1 defense. Can guard guards who dont rely on quickness and post players that have to be in close to score (he is strong enough to hold position, but not tall enough to stop a mid range jumper from a 7ft guy)."
"Some people don't get that defense is about consistency. It is like shooting ability.   People post highlights to prove defensive ability. I could post a highlight of Marcus Smart splashing threes. That doesn't make him a great shooter because I'm editing out the 67% that he clangs.   Rob Williams might have one of the best defensive highlight reels in the NBA. He isn't close to prime Al Horford as a defender, because Al made very few mistakes. Rob still makes mistakes (although less than he used to).   Aaron Gordon isn't a bad defender. He is useful. And his size with good defense is valuable. But this clip makes him look like a DPOY candidate."
"&gt;I think being up 3-2 on KD/Curry Warriors is just as, if not more, impressive than making the Finals in a historically weak conference.  From the Rockets 3 wins against the Warriors in 2018  Harden: 76 points on 25/71 FGs, 6/38 3 point shooting shooting with 11 assists and 12 turnovers  Chris Paul: 63 points on 22/53 FGs, 10/23 3 point shooting with 16 assists and 6 turnovers  Eric Gordon 65 points on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 point shooting with 4 assists and 1 turnover  It doesnt make sense to say any of these performances were better than iverson's carry job. His 2nd leading scorer was Aaron McKie. And reducing how impressive it is because it is the east doesn't make much sense. The sixers finished the season tied for the 2nd best record of anybody in either conference"
"lol i didn’t mean shit about denver, aaron gordon is not all-defense calibre no matter who he plays for  hes not even on the same planet as some of the guys who didnt make all-d last season, let alone the 10 who did"
"Aaron Gordon, Rui, Obi Toppin"
LeVert Brogdon and Warren are injured all the time  Clint Capela is a defensive rim running big man. Their market value is never gonna be as high as high end wing defenders  Aaron Gordon is a better player than Duncan Robinson imo  Jae Crowder was the closest player to Aaron Gordon in terms of archetype but also does less than AG on offense and have similar defensive abilities. He was also 30 when he signed his current deal.  I feel like people keep viewing the AG deal in terms of a 109M cap instead of a ~120M cap that it’s gonna be when his deal expires.
"If Aaron Gordon aka Shawn Marion-lite is getting paid that much, we'll eventually see a player reach $1B in career earnings through salary alone by the end of the next decade."
This is just my guess but it probably had something to do with Grant wanting a chance to prove to himself that he could be a star after numerous years being a role player - whereas Aaron Gordon seems ready to accept after years of being given a chance to star that he's really more of a role player.
I just feel kind of bad for Denver because they wasted a FRP on Grant.   A big wing defender was obviously a huge need for Denver so when they struck out on Grant (check the other comments for reasons why) - they tried again with Aaron Gordon and he's bought into that role of a swiss-army knife guy better than Grant ever did. Aaron Gordon's already tried (and failed) at being the primary guy. He's just not that type of player and luckily the Nuggets don't need him to be that.   I don't blame Grant for wanting the opportunity to bet on himself though especially if it was for the same amount of money. Showing that he can produce well at an increased usage rate can lead to bigger bags on down the line compared to the role he had in Denver.
"They don't need Aaron Gordon to be anything more than a swiss-army knife guy and he's already bought into that role a lot better than Jerami Grant did.  I do think he's overpaid, but big wings get the bag."
"The Denver Nuggets just gave Aaron Gordon a four-year, $92 million contract.  I guess they keep re-watching Uncle Drew with the hopes that he'll finally turn into Casper Jones.  Someone should probably tell 'em it ain't gonna happen."
"huh i thought aaron gordon was a great pickup for them, surprised at everyone saying it's an overpay.."
"Magic/Nuggets fans bet.....  Who pulls down more rebounds per game this year.   Aaron Gordon, or growth spurt Rj Hampton?  Game on!"
Marcus Smart   Tobias Harris   Aaron Gordon  Julius Randle   Robert Williams
Aaron Gordon has as much value to the Nuggets as he does because of how his strengths complement MPJs weaknesses. They are both more valuable playing with each other
"Sometimes non all star players play like all stars but not Aaron Gordon, he's trash"
Obviously an Aaron gordon deal wasn’t going to affect MPJs deal
"I get what you’re saying, but 2025 Aaron Gordon - barring a truly incredible turn of events - will not be anywhere close to a top 80 NBA player, so the point still remains."
"i didn't watch your games but every time i caught one or some clips of one, aaron gordon was either going off or fitting seamlessly with your players and it was nice to see"
"I think it makes sense for them to do that, but I also don't think there's anything else they could say. For the next two years at least I don't think anything will change, but the 23-24  season is when we'd see if they mean it, because Jokic will be on a supermax, Murray on 33.8 million, Aaron Gordon on this deal, and MPJ in the second year of his extension."
"This is dumb. They're never going to be major FA spot, and its nearly impossible to get top players at the end of the draft. I'd much they ""overpay"" for MPJ &amp; Aaron Gordon, when it's shown other franchises that have no one on their caliber would pay it (ala Jerami Grant). I don't get how this is a ""bite in the ass"" unless they're not paying their two other stars. Denver is all in for next few years, that's what NBA is all about."
Giving Aaron Gordon 23 million makes MPJ’s agent job wayyyyy easier  Hell I could be MPJ’s agent right now and use Gordon’s contract as leverage to get MPJ a max deal
I hardly watched the nuggets (I liked the team just they were never playing a fun matchup when I was watching basketball) But in the playoffs watching them against the sun's even tho you were losing just made me respect will Barton and Aaron Gordon alot they were just playing great
Kuzma&gt;Aaron Gordon
"“People Aren’t Going To Take Us Lightly And If They Do, We’re Going To Blow Them Out” - Aaron Gordon (Oct. 28, 2017)  The Magic were 4-1 at the time. They went on to finish the season 25-57."
cap jrue is a borderline top 30-40 player that was coming off 19/5/7 while being an elite defender best known for being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and aaron gordon is a role player coming off of 10/5/2 (with the nuggets) while being an above average defender best known for coming in 2nd in dunk contests they're not the same
Aaron Gordon got dropped and picked up more than almost any other player in my leagues last year lol
"It’s not, Aaron Gordon is great on defense and is a much needed athletic talent the nuggets needed. A healthy nuggets squad scares the shit out of me and are the only team capable of beating the lakers in the west."
How is Aaron Gordon worth that? If this were 50 million I would still be surprised. That guy has a fantastic agent.
Fuck Aaron Gordon seems like he should be older than almost 26
"I get what you're saying but I think you're misunderstanding. The average pay just keeps going up, if a player of Aaron Gordons calibre signs a 4 year contract in 2024, I'm guessing the amount  Gordon is being paid in 2025 (his most expensive year) will be far from the 49th highest paid player. It would realistically be in the realm of 70-80th highest paid player.  You're right that we compare present day to 5 years from now, but that's why no one uses salaries in 2025 with present day earning ranks (49th)."
Wowww happy to see Aaron Gordon with the nuggets for this contract. One crazy team when everyone's healthy.
Wtf is life. Is Aaron gordon really worth 23 a year??
The idea of Aaron Gordon is a lot better than Aaron Gordon
"To be fair, I’ve been hearing about what Aaron Gordon “can be” for a long time now."
"The hard cap doesn't work like this at all, I think you're just talking about them being salary capped. It's true that the nuggets are over the cap pretty much regardless - even if they got rid of the cap holds for all of their FAs (including MPJ) they'd only have something like 7 million in space which is completely pointless (the MLE you get from being over the cap is worth more than that).  All of that being said though, this is kind of wonky reasoning to give if you perceive this as an overpay. Like yeah they can't sign someone to replace Aaron Gordon, but they have options - they could trade for someone with longer on their contract for example. Also, if you don't think a market for Gordon at that price exists, it still doesn't make sense to pay that much.  Not saying I agree or disagree with it being an overpay, just pointing out that it's not like the nuggets have to pay him whatever he asks for."
Also... Aaron Gordon can pretty much get an open 3 whenever he wants simply because he's not worth defending... Doesn't really matter who is running the point
"So who was better, Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon?"
"Jokic is the reigning MVP, MPJ dropped 25 a game down the stretch, Murray was a 21-6-5 guy before his injury, and Aaron Gordon is a 4th option who can ballhandle, and ideally he can hit open threes, maybe he will take a step past 12 a game. Thats a championship level core, not a super team but can absolutely win a ring. Throw in good role players like Facu, Bones, Barton, Nnaji, and maybe Bol Bol if he ever becomes something, and I don't really see the issue."
Draymond Green and Aaron Gordon are both NBA players
Grant for Aaron Gordon. 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
"Why would I compare what Aaron Gordon is going to make in 2025 to what Enes Kanter made in 2020?  You can't know exactly what individual contracts are going to look like, but the distribution of salaries is relatively predictable since that's basically just determined by the salary cap which is determined by league revenue which is largely determined by media contracts that are signed in advance.  Obviously covid has thrown a wrench into some of those projections, but the cap is still going to go up over the course of this contract"
Aaron Gordon is the Myles Turner of forwards....and I say that respectfully. Lol.
Aaron gordon is a lot more useful as a cutter though and can actually dribble.  You pay a premium for wings who can both dribble and defend as opposed  to catch and shooters
"Seems it's closer to $88m but I'm curious how it's structured. Hell of a lot to pay for Aaron Gordon, especially when they could have kept Jerami Grant for less."
"My point isn't that the Nuggets should've tried to sign Powell in the off-season, rather it's about the value of the contract. Norman Powell is in a different league than Aaron Gordon on the offensive side and is a solid defender (not better than Gordon to be fair). I think the point is that Gordon is a good fit for the nuggets, but they probably could've gotten him for a reasonably cheaper amount."
What does that say about his framework?  Was Gordon ever going to be a start in the NBA?  Aaron was one of the few people that bought in his hype and believed he would be the league's next Blake/Marion.   I believe his confidence was harmed by his loss in the Dunk Contest. Things like that can boost your confidence as a young player.
"Aaron Gordon just signed for 4 years for $92 million, thoughts?"
"I don't think you understand the difficulties of signing and keeping great talent in small markets. These aren't panic moves, they are necessary. To quote the r/denvernuggets mod u/IdRatherBeLurking:  &gt;This is maybe the best way I can put the Gordon extension:   $24 million per year for Aaron Gordon for most teams: massive overapy   $24 million per year for the already cap-strapped Nuggets: slight overpay   Not keeping Aaron Gordon in free agency: Disaster.  We don't get the luxury of matching salaries and keeping players (see Grant last year when we matched his 20M / Year offer with Detroit)."
every year a sucker drafts aaron gordon and every year aaron gordon ends up on the waivers by week 3
Pay Aaron Gordon and run out of space for MPJ would be funny.
"Harris, Grant, Wiggins,   pretty huge gap,  Barnes, Gordon.  Aaron Gordon is in like his 7th year and is still all potential. I’m sick of that dude"
Look up his numbers against some of the best players on the league. Gordon puts guys on straps. He’s one of the best wing defenders in the league.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/nuggets/news/what-aaron-gordon-adds-to-nuggets-032521
"Interestingly, Jerami Grant will be getting paid less than Aaron Gordon. I'd say Harris, Barnes, Wiggins, Grant, and Gordon."
"People are out here saying Harrison Barnes getting payed $20 million a year is a grossly overpaid contract, say whatever your want, Barnes is a far superior player to Aaron Gordon Jesus"
23M/yr for Aaron Gordon?? His agent deserves a bonus for that contract
"Lol man what are you talking about? This is possibly the stupidest list I've ever seen.  Mario is **out of the league** and EP will probably be out of the league soon. Sabonis didn't play 1 second for us because he was traded on draft night. Aaron Gordon has done what exactly? He's not the player you thought he was because he dunks good. He's a roleplayer, not a star. He had ample opportunity to shine here and we tried him in many different roles and he was never more than a roleplayer. He's the fourth option on the Nuggets. It's so easy to just say because he never took a leap that it was our fault but of course you have no idea what you're talking about. If anything he would have had a much shorter leash on another team. Oladipo had 1 great year and has been pretty mediocre since that one year. He's been the laughing stock of this subreddit for the past year.   Why not just admit you don't actually know what you're talking about and are just parroting what you see everyone else say?"
* Aaron Gordon * Mario Hezonja * Victor Oladipo * Elfrid Payton * Domantas Sabonis  The sample size and pattern here cannot be ignored.
Get that trade value up. I could see a contender overpaying to get him similar to Aaron Gordon
Got him as the salary filler for Aaron Gordon at the deadline in March
I would confuse him for Aaron Gordon
"Yeah, some people probably hate the idea of getting rid of the dunk contest, but I think it's just gotten stale. The best guys don't compete in it, and it feels like all the best dunks have already been done. I think Aaron Gordon trying to use a drone was the sign that the dunk contest has officially jumped the shark."
"The fit isn’t there.  Aaron Gordon does everything besides the passing, although, with good instead of great defense, and much better shooting.  I wouldn’t want to give up Murray or Porter Jr for Simmons at all especially when apparently neither was on the table for Harden."
Nice to Monte and Aaron Gordon improve. I'm not too worried about this game and jazz are looking quite decent
aaron gordon looks like a total drama character sometimes
yeah his teammate aaron gordon
"occasionally aaron gordon is like ""heres how good you guys thought i would be"""
who the fuck took over aaron gordon tonight
Aaron Gordon and MPJ about to cook us aren't they?
Where did this Aaron Gordon come from?
I find it odd that Mike Malone addresses him as Aaron Gordon
LeBron watched highlights of Keldon Johnson big body slamming Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter Jr into oblivion the other night and was like... Nah fam I'm good.
Nah he'll deserve it but Aaron Gordon will be awarded it instead.
"**G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **G:** CJ McCollum  **F:** Tobias Harris   **F:** Serge Ibaka  **C:** Myles Turner  **Bench:** Lou Williams, Alec Burks, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic"
This game is hammered. 2021 Kevin Love faceups vs Aaron Gordon off the dribble
You missed the point. It would be unfair if we have another Aaron Gordon situation. Nobody cares about the league we care about the players getting screwed over.
I don’t think anything will ever top Aaron Gordon vs Zach Lavine
That Zach Lavine vs. Aaron Gordon dunk off was GOAT.
"&gt; Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Austin Rivers is a better SG than CJ McCollum?  &gt; 18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further.  18-19 was also a year where Dame carried a series that, frankly, the Blazers *should* have won...and then the Blazers won a series that, frankly, Dame didn't carry.  And then they ran into a buzzsaw.  Hardly a case of Dame being let down by his roster.  And this is the limitation of only looking at   &gt; how we lost to better teams.  Because *of course* the conclusion of that assessment is that Dame is let down by his teams.  That's the only conclusion that *could* be reached from this sample other than ""Dame and the Blazers both deserved to lose every time they lost.""  Which is very unlikely and also a shitty-feeling conclusion to reach."
Aaron Gordon
Something about Aaron Gordon really annoys me.
Aaron Gordon is a better fit for this team than Grant. Grant was great but his rebounding and playmaking just aren't up to par with what Gordon brings to the Nuggs
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
Aaron Gordon.  Y'all romanticise the past way too much
Aaron Gordon going for the best role player in the nba title this year
Kyle Lowry is seemingly friends with every single player in the league. Except Aaron Gordon.
He is long and athletic and has the full potential but he’s also disinterested in it and it shows. It’s not jabari Parker level and he can get away with it more now that they have Aaron Gordon but c’mon are you gonna sit there and pretend he isn’t hunted on defense in close games?
Lmao then they should put Aaron Gordon and Zack Lavigne there then Vince Carter just isn't a top 75 player
I don't mind giving Aaron Gordon and something else for him if he is willing to play. Our issue is still defense and Simmons would definitely help hide some oj jokic s and mpjs issues
MPJ was injured in the suns series. He and Aaron Gordon were both playing through injuries because the team couldn't be down both those two and a number of their guards (not even including Jamal Murray).
"goddamn it, i'm so tired of these shit articles that only ever look at stats without any eye test and then proclaim conclusions as if basketball is played in a vacuum  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, however, are Thunder sophomores Aleksej Pokusevski and Théo Maledon, who according to multiple advanced metrics rated as the two worst players in the league last season.   if all it takes to figure out the value of a player is to look at his stats on paper, Westbrook is the greatest player of all time. If this dude who wrote this article actually watched a single OKC game last year, he'd know that Poku is a bonafide diamond in the rough, even though his stats were horrible. He's got both the size and the skill, and he's shown genuine flashes of brilliance in almost every game he's played.  How the hell is sad ass Orlando Magic rated higher than OKC when their top 3 best players were all over 25, and they traded Aaron Gordon for RJ Barret that wouldn't even break the top 5 in Oklahoma??   Christ, what a trash article"
That Aaron Gordon block was money 💰💰💰
Not really talked about was that Porter Jr and Aaron Gordon carried injuries that entire series.
"Ah yes, as we all expected, Will Barton and Aaron Gordon pulling our ass out of the fire in the fourth.  Jokes aside, legit great game from our side, and we'll hold our munders high tonight."
AARON GORDON MY GOD
"I liked the Barnes pick a lot more, after seeing him play with the team.  His upside is actually ridiculous and he has the size advantage over Suggs, which is actually considerably huge in today’s league.  I think he can become like a rich-man’s Aaron Gordon, or at least that hypothetical player."
Does only Orlando frontload contracts these days. Cavs could have gotten him big bucks early to see what he delivers today with the potential of offload in the cheap later if need be. Magic were doing it with Aaron Gordon and now Wendell Carter Jr
Aaron Gordon is being payed 19 million next year.  Wiggins will be making 33 million.
"Aaron Gordon is a good comp.   That’s why those stats are very deceiving, he was guarding the other teams best player every night. Eye test showed he did very well."
"Nah. There will be teams that will try to get him as a cheap addition of talent, regardless of his current behaviour.  They'll probably value him somewhere between Draymond and Aaron Gordon. A great defender, with playmaking ability and a good cutter but he won't turn himself into a shooter anytime soon, so he won't be a centerpiece to build a team around.  If you are looking for a player who can defend 1-4 and some 5s while being your secondary playmaker and you've good plenty of shooting on your roster already, sure offer some first round picks and you might have a player who can be a missing piece for you. But no franchise player."
"&gt;The Clips without Kawhi were far better in the playoffs than the Nuggets without Murray and Kawhi is far superior to Jamal  you know they were missing more than just murray right?  they had to play austin rivers 40 mins and he was picked up 3 weeks before the playoffs lol  &gt;they wildly overreacted to some 7 game win streak in March about the Nuggets.  the ""7 game win streak"" was actually a 23-7 after the gordon trade, which is a 63 win pace over a full feason  &gt;Same team that needed multiple 3-1 comebacks just to win playoff series in the bubble before getting punked by the Lakers  ...are we shitting on a team for getting to WCF and losing to prime lebron + AD?  &gt;they really arent that good and no Aaron Gordon really doesnt change as much as people claim he does.  pretty sure people are projecting them as a contender mostly because MPJ is entering his 3rd season looking like a 6'10 ray Allen   OP asked for spicy takes, not ""I haven't watched a game in 3 years"" takes"
"The ""healthy"" Nuggets are the most overrated team in the NBA and still wouldve lost comfortably in 5-6 games last year even with Jamal Murray. The Clips without Kawhi were far better in the playoffs than the Nuggets without Murray and Kawhi is far superior to Jamal, people just dont hold the Nuggets to expectations of top market teams and felt sorry for them due to the Jamal injury. Same team that needed multiple 3-1 comebacks just to win playoff series in the bubble before getting punked by the Lakers, they really arent that good and no Aaron Gordon really doesnt change as much as people claim he does."
"Aaron Gordon averaged 9ppg in the Nuggets/Suns series and got $92M, what’s your point?"
Aaron Gordon and Ben Simmons together on the floor isn't a great idea since both are horrible for off ball spacing
it makes them easier to trade if they don't pan out for us. see Aaron Gordon.
There must be an Aaron Wing in that hospital where Aaron Gordon and Aaron Judge were created. Couldn’t even change their faces either.
"Yeah, he doesn't do Aaron Gordon/Zach LaVine type dunks, but those aren't even feasible in game. Giannis cleared an entire 6'6'' person while dunking. That's exciting"
Aaron Gordon got a good deal tbf
"Slight overpay but given the chance of another cap explosion and going by the current trend of contracts of similar level players, it's a good deal for both sides   His contract is somewhere in the range of lonzo and Aaron Gordon and he's still improving so I think it's a W for the suns."
That’s Aaron Gordon money
"No you made a stupid comparison lol the original comment about Aaron Gordon making an all defense team is unlikely but possible, therefore being a hot take. No one in history has ever said Marco Bellinelli is the greatest player ever. That was just dumb lol"
"Why?  He’s a great defender player, but isn’t good enough to warrant himself in the conversation of the league’s top-best defensive players.  I actually like Aaron Gordon a lot too."
Time for my annual Aaron Gordon for All Defense prediction.
Aaron Gordon for example. Will get 23m a year which is a bit too much but Barnes is making less and is a bit better imo. Can't really call Bojan a two way forward but he's making around what Barnes is making and i think Bojan is worth it. Jerami Grant obviously deserves 20m a year. I think 19m a year for Barnes is reasonable. There just aren't many two way forwards in the league.
I feel like Aaron Gordon never had good impact stats though. However they are very similar in that people delude themselves into thinking they will change a team
"He's a better player, but I feel like the exact same thing happened with Aaron Gordon a year apart. Suddenly everyone was talking about these guys as huge difference makers in the middle of the season."
Honestly anything that was saying he was a #1 pick caliber player was not accurate. He's a bad shooter and good not great at everything else. Could be an Aaron Gordon type player.
Aaron Gordon
Aaron “Lemmywinks” Gordon
"They'll be better with him for sure but if Aaron Gordon plays close to his full potential after getting the off-season to mesh with the team even a lineup of Morris, Barton, Gordon, MPJ, and Jokic has plenty of play making ability. They'll still be fun to watch, and will just get that much better when Jamal comes back."
AARON GORDON WITH THAT WEIRD GERBIL THING WITH HIS EX
"East: rozier, levert, jerami grant, tobias harris, turner .  West: murray, mccollum, harrison barnes, aaron gordon, wood"
aaron gordon with that weird gerbil thing with his ex
Best player in the Aaron Gordon trade
"Right, and sun's fans act like it was only Murray who the nuggets were missing. Aaron Gordon was at like 75% Barton was out, MPJ was at like 80%. Sun's just aren't as good as they think they are."
I doubt Aaron Gordon improves or wins it in his 8th season. Garland is possible but how much can he improve from 17 PPG and 6APG? And Brooks? Cmon lol. He’s missing the start of the season and they just aren’t giving it to 3&amp;D guys.
Aaron Gordon or Darius Garland
I'm not sure he's a good fit with Jokic because he's too slow to play the 3 and you need a defensive 4 next to Jokic. Nuggets defense isnt stopping anyone in the playoffs with just Aaron Gordon.
No idea why we don’t copy what Denver do with their offence and team build but have Bron on the Jokic role. Imagine that with a guard like Lowry and then have AD spacing/cutting off ball like Aaron Gordon.
Well done. The real question -- is the effect opposite for [Aaron Gordon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrDcm2MwRlw)?
DWade rigged the dunk contest in 2020 against Aaron Gordon
The Aaron Gordon trade made sense but damn I miss Gary ‘Gary Harris’ Harris as a Nugget.
He went over in the Aaron Gordon trade.
"Aaron Gordon too, but it seems like training with Kobe did absolutely nothing."
In the other hand +2 for it being kyle Lowry. He only tried to cripple Aaron Gordon for instance.
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"Doug McDermott is like, a freak cutter.  I love Aaron Gordon, and Jake Layman is/has been a great cutter.  Willie Caulie-Stein has always been a cutting big I've had a soft spot for.  Naz Reid is coming along, his weight loss keeps adding so much burst and he's got such good touch on the finish."
Aaron Gordon is a very good cutter.
"Dunno how far back you wanna go but Andre Roberson had super clean backdoor cuts with the Thunder.   Current players, I like watching Jerami Grant and Aaron Gordon when they cut."
Aaron Gordon
Simmons is a devastating player in transition and a wonderful defender. The problem is that we collectively have treated him as a poor-man's LeBron when he was closer to Aaron Gordon 2.0.
"Thing about Aaron Gordon is it doesn’t matter what his stats are, the Jokic/Gordon lob &amp; slam’s worth 90mil on its own just for the aesthetics"
Will probably make less than what Aaron Gordon just signed for. More than Marcus Morris’s contract. So 15-22m per year
"It's all right, the rim refuses Aaron Gordon, too."
Zion.  A couple of years ago it was Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon had a fantastic second jump in college. It was pretty good in his early NBA years but admittedly I haven't watched him play as much so not sure if he still has it to the level he did.

Aaron Gordon
last I checked Aaron Gordon played in the second round of the playoffs last season
"Everytime I see anything featuring Aaron Gordon, he seems like a real dickhead."
Aaron Gordon enforcing 6ft separation.
"Luka put up huge numbers while being guarded by two of the best wing defenders in the league, dame did it while being guarded by Austin Rivers Facu and Aaron Gordon (a great defender but not quite the same as Kawhi/PG)"
Aaron Gordon loved this**
"I know it's fun to dump on Porzingis now but he's not worse than Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo, or Aaron Gordon"
Aaron Gordon joins in the approval.
"The main thing that's wrong with Simmons is that he's on a max contract and becau of that Philly has him in as a PG.  If he was on a contract like the one Aaron Gordon just got with the Nuggets, he'd be correctly paid for what he does--elite defense and transition scoring, occasionally dunking in the half court, and excellent vision and play-making."
"Sorry, prepare for a long one....  MPJ was amazing for the 18 games after Murray went down, yes. But in the playoffs he was basically a 3&amp;D role player. Had some really great quarters, some really bad games (game 3 (or 4?) against Portland he scored just 3 points for instance). Put it this way - MPJ to this point in his career has not shaped a playoff series in the way that Jokic completely controlled the series against Portland, or against LAC / Utah, or Portland and SAS 3 years ago, or in the way that Jamal Murray completely changed the Utah series / Game 7 vs LAC, for instance. Hell, MPJ's never even affected a playoff series in the way that Aaron Gordon has (back with Orlando he actually did a good job defending Kawhi in their series vs Toronto, Orlando was just so overmatched it didnt really matter).  So to your point - there are a lot of guys stepping up in ways that they werent able to last year. Aaron Gordon has been terrific all year. Defensively he's been incredible, guarding 5 positions and usually the best player on the opponent. Offensively he's really blossoming in the last two weeks since MPJs injury - he's punishing switches when he has a smaller wing or guard on him (which is most games), and getting to the rim relentlessly. He didnt really get a chance to show that stuff last year. Will Barton is CLEARLY much healthier than he was in the playoffs against PHX - people will say he and Monte were healthy against PHX but they clearly are moving better, more explosively this year, etc. It's really not close. So until Jamal Murray comes back the big fill in's for MPJ will be AG and Will Barton who have been terrific all year, again, and some others here and there.  Bones is fun because he gives them a dynamic off the bench that Denver just hasnt had, maybe since JR Smith? Or since Will Barton was much younger? He can come in and immediately just fill it up and score in bunches, plays with such enthusiasm and energy. They definitely didnt have a guy like that last year off the bench.  Last point to be made as well - right now, they're starting Jeff Green at the 3/4 in place of MPJ and while the ceiling is *so much lower* for what he can do and what those lineups can do compared to the possibilities with MPJ, the frontcourt of Gordon, Green, and Jokic is something like +26 in net rating so far - 130 offensive rating, 104 defensive. That rating will come down. But Green as a smart vet who's been around just understands how to play on both ends. Understands where and when to cut, and he's enormous, and can also punish switches just as AG can, which opens more avenues for Jokic and Gordon. MPJ is more talented than Green. No doubt. But MPJ also very clearly doesnt really understand 5 on 5 basketball yet for whatever reason, at least not consistently... That's part of why he has had stretches where things look great, and stretches this year where things look bad and super clunky because he doesnt really know where to move without the ball to open things for himself or his teammates. Or he's hesitant which makes it a beat too slow.  So all that said - the Nuggets really just need to hover around 4th-6th until Jamal Murray comes back. My bet is he's back in March. And when he's back, they'll go on a big time run (partly because he makes them that much better, and partly because after ASB, the Nuggets have 23 games, 14 of them at home, and only 2 b2bs in that stretch... it's the easiest schedule in the league post ASB)."
They didn't want Aaron Gordon and MPJ focusing on money making stats over winning during a year where they had a realistic title shot  The Nuggets have also placed a big priority on loyalty and culture under Malone/Connelly regime.  It didn't work out in this case but I find it hard to nitpick a team too hard when they built a legit contender without top 5 picks or a star free agent
Jokic  Embiid  Clint Capela  Julius Randle  Jerami Grant  Marcus Smart  Jusef Nurkic  Possibly Aaron Gordon
1. Jokic 2. Clint Capela 3. Embiid 4. Dwight Powell 5. Julius Randle 6. Jeremi Grant 7. Marcus Smart 8. Aaron Gordon 9. Kyle Anderson 10. Jusef Nurkic 11. Wiggins
"I think they're gonna be a dynamite regular season team. All the pieces just fit so well together offensively they're gonna blow the doors off a lot of teams.   The playoffs are a huge issue though as you say. They really have no shot against the Nets or Bucks if those two teams are healthy. Giannis is uncoverable for them. KD the same (hell, honestly, Aaron Gordon absolutely cooked them in the first matchup vs. Denver because... they had to use DDR and Zach and Caruso against him, and he's very good at pounding smaller guys - they survived only because Jok didnt play)."
"He’s also missing his 3rd best player now. So if he carries his team to a top 4 seed with Aaron Gordon as the second best player, I can see the narrative for him as mvp as well. It’s going to be a super competitive mvp race this year"
He’s your next Aaron Gordon with better passing
"The Nuggets starters are still pretty good compared to their bench. And Jokic is just that good, Luka doesn't even compare to how valuable Jokic to Nuggets is right now. And btw Aaron Gordon and Monte Morris on/off are also above +20, but bench player like Campazzo and Rivers have -20."
"The only thing I can figure is that he was looking at Aaron Gordon. If you keep pause it, you can see he throws it to the corner the millisecond Gordon starts going straight to the basket. So Jokic must figure that when Gordon, who has a lot of lob gravity, goes toward the basket, someone needs to tag him, most likely the corner defender.  I think it was intentional, though he was soley going off of Gordon cutting. Or I might be dead wrong idk"
oh right I forgot lonzo has an afro now too  so whats the all afro team  PG - lonzo  SG - immanuel quickley  SF - aaron gordon  PF - marvin bagley  C - jarrett allen  maybe there are other afros around I dont know of them though
Aaron Gordon or robin lopez
Aaron Gordon vs the ghost of Gabe Vincent lol.
"Come on now…Ya’ll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they’re all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don’t know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that’s the MVP."
"I think you’re not taking into account how easy it is to sign good role players when you’re a contending team and well-managed. We had our two key guys in Giannis and Middleton, you have Jokic and Murray. After that, the vast majority of our team was built on FAs (Lopez, Portis, Connaughton, Hill) or trades (Holiday, Allen). We let Brogdon go after he was just about the only guy to show up in the ECF because we didn’t think it was worth the money.  What makes the Nuggets so uniquely unappealing compared to Milwaukee that it’s impossible to sign young FAs that need to develop (Connaughton) or get guys on slight discounts (Portis) or get guys past their prime that still have a bit in the tank (Lopez)? Shit, you already had a version of the Holiday trade where you picked up Aaron Gordon and that’s going great. Not every player in the league is desperate to jump to LA as soon as possible, a lot of them just want to compete for titles."
"Jokic+Murray is a Championship core. They were right there in 2020 when MPJ was a rookie and just a glorified Will Barton (at that point, he's obviously much better now and going forward).   Could've easily flipped MPJ in a trade like the Aaron Gordon trade for a superstar."
"Jokic, Barton, Aaron Gordon, and Monte Morris is a good enough team to compete for a lower seed in the west. Who knows maybe Murray comes back"
Aaron Gordon is not a bad role player.
"1. 3rd surgery happened after he signed the contract  2. There are more ""max"" players than you would think, with every team capable of supporting at least 2 max players. The cost of a max player is lower than people think, with people assume that there should be at most like 20 max players in the NBA. When there are at least 60 max ""slots"" in the NBA. You max a young player with promise.  3. Its the CBA -- the NBA has a soft cap, BUT you have to use exceptions or Bird rights to go over the cap. That is why all the players who want to go to a big market it force their way out of contracts early go to a big market with your bird rights intact, thenthe team signs its free agents, and THEN resigns the player with bird rights.  ALL contending teams spend into the luxury tax, its almost as if you need a lot of good players tp contend. So if you think you are about to contend you get into the luxury tax and an easy way is to use Bird Rights. If the young player doesn't work out you attach assets and trade for role players to a team that will try to rehab the player and then flip for more assets (like OKC right now)The Nuggets did believe they were about to be a contender based on the bubble playoffs and their performance post Aaron Gordon trade). I understand what the Nuggets did, I have no idea what the Suns were doing with Ayton, cause even if he is not worth the max, sign him, trade him with assets attached(ie. picks that are worthless for a contending team anyways) for a couple of players that fit better, but you don't just not sign him unless there is no doubt that player isn't worth a max AND won't develop into a near max player."
"They have Jokic and Murray, as good a duo as you could ask for.....and paired them with Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon......"
"10-15%? Lol where are you getting these numbers from. Draymond never would’ve been close to Aaron Gordon… part of AG’s identity is his crazy hops and athleticism and Draymond is strong but nowhere nearly as bouncy.   You keep focusing on these “could have” when what we see them as on the Warriors are probably the best versions of themselves… which is All Star level NBA players. They have an amazing coach, amazing organization behind them and all the staff to develop it. Not many other orgs could really extract that much more talent from already world class athletes."
I didnt mean improve to be like steph. I meant more like 10-15% better. He would train way more his handle rather than his defense for example.  And draymond was a scorer in college. And he could have developed into a more aaron gordon type of player imo.
They would need to 6 man Aaron Gordon and have bol bol play defensive lineups potentially at the 5 on defense and 4 on offense with jokic
"Jokic could stand to get better on defense, but it's just as much an issue with roster construction. Most everyone they have is good offensively, and the players they had for defense in the past seemed to have flamed out; don't watch a lot of Nuggets games, has Aaron Gordon been good this year? Seems like they could maybe use another trade to try and even out the roster a bit."
"So I think there’s a very fair case that Steph is the best in the world, and he’s probably who my pick would be. But you’re kind of accidentally arguing that Jokic is the best right now lol. Dudes been playing with Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris and a bunch of cardboard cut outs where NBA players are supposed to be"
Dumb as fuck. Aaron Gordon is what you get if you take away all of lebrons skill.
No he isn't first why would new York trade for someone who can't play in the homes state. Second kyrie is an excellent basketball player beliefs aside. Plenty of teams in the league would probably take him for more than just Aaron Gordon. If he is out of state he can play.
You're looking at getting Aaron Gordon or Emanuel Quickly and a bad contract or two in return for Kyrie.  He's less valuable than Ben Simmons right now.
Fuck Aaron Gordon tho...

"I often talk about the ""Hall of Very Good."" The logo is Thaddeus Young with Jeff Green in the Top 10. But Aaron Gordon doesn't even make that team. Instead he is in the Hall of ""Oh Yea, he was in the NBA"""
"&gt;Aaron Gordon isn’t even that good, i’d rather have Larry Nance.  Lol. K."
"yeah this comment is terrible for a bunch of reasons.  &gt;The rest of the roster aside from Dame and CJ isn’t very good.  Yes it is, but even if it wasn't, you judging our role player's talents based on their ppg is beyond idiotic.  1) None of those guys you listed except for Powell are expected to carry a significant load. Even Nurk, while expected to score, is not needed to score more than 12-15 as a 4th option.   2) Powell at 17ppg as a 3rd option is great, how many 3rd options do that? And how many of them do it at his efficiency?  3) How can you say scoring is our problem when we're one of the best offensive teams in the league  &gt; Having lost Melo’s scoring makes a CJ trade less likely because who are you replacing his production with?  This is how I know that you haven't watched a single Blazers game last year or this year.   1) Melo is inefficient, we don't really need anyone to replace his scoring in the first place  2) Anfernee Simons and Norm Powell MORE than make up for Melo's scoring  3) Trading CJ just gives more touches to Simons and Powell, who can absolutely replace his production sufficiently between the two. Late game situations might be the only time we might miss CJ, but when you have Dame, late-game situations is not something you'll lose sleep over.  4) Once again, scoring is not our issue by any means, not for our starters and not for our bench  &gt;Get mad at the GM for not getting Aaron Gordon when he was available   1) We literally gave the Magic a better offer than what they ended up taking from the Nuggets   2) Aaron Gordon isn't even that good, i'd rather have Larry Nance. Which we do"
"The rest of the roster aside from Dame and CJ isn’t very good.  Covington is giving you 7 ppg, LNJ 6.5 ppg, Nurkic 12 ppg, Powell 17 ppg.    Having lost Melo’s scoring makes a CJ trade less likely because who are you replacing his production with?  Do you really want Simmons giving you 10 ppg in the playoffs?  You would need to be the best defense in the WC for that to make sense.  Get mad at the GM for not getting Aaron Gordon when he was available or a similar trade but CJ isn’t the problem."
"They've gotten significantly better since then. Jokic took another step forward, they added Aaron Gordon and Porter Jr has begun to emerge. The only question for Denver is health"
"Yeah, it's not like the following factors will play a role -  Jokic has made a significant leap since that time.  We were missing our 2nd best guard.  We signed Aaron Gordon who's arguably one of the best wing defenders in the league.  Anthony Davis will have to shoot the ball outside the bubble."
Aaron Gordon deserves love
"It’s makes me so sad as a nuggets fan. We have a big 3 and Aaron Gordon all locked in. Once Murray was healthy I thought we could compete for a championship, and now it looks bleak. Especially since half our team is hurt right now."
"According to wikipedia, Aaron Gordon: Gordon's great-great grandfather, a Native American Osage Indian, was seven feet tall."
"A lot of Zach Lavine's dunks during in the dunk contests he was in. IIRC he kept doing the same ones over and over but with only a *slight* difference each time, but kept getting 50s because his reputation and the judges being faulty as always. Aaron Gordon should have won at least the first one, maybe even both."
"THis year Aaron Gordon, last year MPJ, the year before that Jerami Grant"
"I remember the hype behind a potential D’Lo for Aaron Gordon or Robert Covington trade.   Back then a lot of people wanted the Warriors to take Covington instead of Wiggins lol, in hindsight that sounds disgustingly bad considering the Warriors were going to be over the cap either way."
"That's a major undersell. Guys like Luke Kennard, Malik Beasley, Marcus Morris, Bertans, Markkanen, Duncan Robinson, Bojan, Joe Harris, Aaron Gordon are all making 14 mil+. There's no reason Bobby couldn't get that much."
"Since Ant is from Minny, i would say Aaron Gordon"
"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"
Aaron Gordon definitely isn’t perpetually injured.
"I like that Aaron Gordon sees Lillard near half court, and still runs out to contest the shot. That's some respect."
Aaron Gordon has to step up now lol
How's Norm who's 6'4 suppose to guard Aaron Gordon who's 6'9 and probably has 50 pounds on him.
Aaron Gordon on the bench looked like he appreciated that one. At least more than Austin lmaoo
I feel bad for Aaron Gordon. I want to go back in time to last season when we first acquired him and the Nuggets were on a nice winning streak. Now… :(
"Besides the Mavs and Clippers game there's a severe lack of good games to watch tonight. Jokic is out vs the Blazers and watching the Aaron Gordon led squad isn't fun, LeBron was out against the Knicks and didn't think they'd make a game of it but I was apparently wrong, and Pistons vs Heat was too much of a mismatch although they did a good job of keeping it close.  The one night so far this week that I needed some games to rid me of my boredom and i gotta wait till 9:30..."
Wiggins  Randle  Aaron Gordon  Jabari Parker   One of these is not like the other
"Sincerely,   Aaron Gordon"
"I hate Aaron Gordon. I'm happy he never won a dunk contest, whether he deserved it or not and I hope that almost winning like 4 dunk contests is the only meaningful thing in his professional career. I love Jokic and Murray, want them to win a championship or two someday, but not while Aaron Gordon is on the same team. As long as Gordon is a Nugget, they could get knocked out in the first round for all I care.  The worst part is, there is no reason for this. I've never met the guy and, as far as I'm aware, he's never done anything worth hating. I mean, the only annoying thing he's done is whine about losing dunk contests, including writing a terrible song about the one in 2020. But all that being said, fuck Aaron Gordon."
Yall ever have a player that when you look at him you just angry? Yeah thats Aaron Gordon for me. Fuck Aaron Gordon
"Some guys respond differently to ACL tears. In general they are not career threatening / altering as they were in the 80s but you can see guys like Aaron Gordon, Lowry and others move like they never tore them"

Such a bummer to see Aaron Gordon fit so well on a team finally and then the team may have imploded due to injuries

"It’s almost like the nuggets look like a completely different team without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji. Who could have predicted this?"
"""Pouring milk before the cereal is a perfectly valid approach""  - Aaron Gordon (possibly)"
I dont like Aaron Gordon and I dont really know why.
"I think the foul Ayton got on Aaron Gordon was kinda bullshit, but besides that, the refs have been just about equally ass for both teams"
Aaron Gordon looking like he having flashbacks of Feb 2020 lol
"Aaron Gordon couldn’t miss tonight even if he wanted, he was making some insanely hard shots and we sure didn’t make it easy on him.   Also not having vuc really sucked on this trip but it just means that much more that we came out of this west coast trip with a positive record"
"Wood and Grant. Both have 1.5 years contracts, both are in tanking teams (though Detroit might try to jump into play in). Deadline is the best time to trade them, their value will only go down afterwards. Both can be acquired for a similar package to Aaron Gordon last year: lottery protected pick, a decent promising young player, and a filler."

"First of all, as another person born and raised in SJ I'm very disappointed in you being a Harden and not Steph or maybe Aaron Gordon guy (kidding, kind of).  I think an issue here is that both sides (generally, not necessarily you and me) are accusing the other side of an extreme view that isn't relly being advocated. As I tried and perhaps failed to explain, I agree that Harden is a really good basketball player. He is really fucking good. I don't think his entire game is free throws. In fact, if he averages like ~5 a game, I would probably love him (well, maybe like him a lot. I don't love the heliocentric offenses like him and Luka that much)   But he doesn't average 5 FTs a game, he averages 11 or whatever. He basically has led the league by a lot every year on the Rockets. As I have repeated too many times, he has more FTs than FGs in his career. Leaving aside the flailing and the flopping, just the fact that he is the **only person in the entire history of the NBA** to make more FTs than FG is really telling of his playstyle and the way he approaches the game.  He's not just another guy that shoots a lot of free throws, he is literally in a class by himself in the 75-year history of the league when it comes to free throws, and it has made the league and his teams less fun to watch in my opinion. The flailing and flopping is just the cherry on top.  But to reiterate, I don't think he is a bad player or not otherwise skilled. In fact, part of the frustration is that he is obviously so good but chooses to rely heavily on fouls instead of more fun ways to play."
"First of all, who the fuck is the mitten? Second, aaron Gordon isn’t the same dunker anymore. He’s a poor man’s Dirk Nowitzki."
"No. The mitten, Aaron Gordon, lavine. 1 of 3"
Aaron Gordon probably having PTSD from giving his best effort and losing to Lavine again
"Aaron Gordon letting Zach know he hasn’t forgotten about the dunk contest. Huge win to end the road trip, big ups to Derrick Jones Jr. for always being ready to contribute despite up &amp; down minutes early on so far this year. I know the Bulls’ bench isn’t elite or anything, but after the past few years just having some guys who are reliable &amp; have a/some strong skill sets is an enormous upgrade in general for our depth"
Stacy and Adam are definitely homers but they get excited when the opposing team makes a great play or when an opposing player does something crazy. I guarantee you they would've given us a good reaction if it was like Aaron Gordon dunking that instead of Jones
God damn it now I feel like an ass arguing about stupid shit. Anyways Aaron Gordon is fucking sick
Yeah pure effort from DJJ and Jevonte Green. Just pure hustle boards. I didn't know Aaron Gordon was so damn good.
Aaron Gordon couldn’t miss. He should have gotten the ball way more than he did this game.
Aaron Gordon turned into lebron and Campazzo turned into god
Zach LaVine defeats Aaron Gordon yet again. All is right with the world.
Aaron Gordon was hitting everything tonight lmao. Played his heart out
I'm sure there are some fans down in Orlando who are wondering why exactly Aaron Gordon couldn't play like this all the time.
is this the best game Aaron Gordon has ever had?
Aaron Gordon with the business decision on that one lol
"That's an awful lot of words for ""I don't know what I'm talking about"".  Denver tried to bring him back but he picked Detroit so he could have his own team. The Nuggets missed him to where they traded for Aaron Gordon to fill that role.   You literally said what he does well, which are very important in today's game and don't understand why he's viewed positively?   I think he's going to get better because the man puts in the work."
Siakam definitely needs to be playing like an Aaron Gordon type role.
Aaron Gordon for the Nuggets
Do nuggets fans like Aaron Gordon? Dude is not worth his contract

"From the article:  “It’s all well and good that we have some other things to entertain us, like Steph Curry doing Steph things with a real team around him in Golden State and the DeMar DeRozan-led Bulls trucking teams in the East.  Just don’t lose sight of the big picture, folks: Jokic is still the most effective regular-season player in basketball. Voters seemingly reluctantly gave him the MVP last year and again appear to be scanning the universe for alternatives, and it may be harder to convince them after seeing Curry go amazeballs on Tuesday in the league’s most prominent TV game of the season.  People: I get the Stephmania and all because the Warriors have been unbelievable (and we’ll get to that soon here), but for the love of all that is holy, would you please stop dismissing Jokic? He’s basically a 7-foot point guard at this point, dragging an injury-riddled Denver team to competence.  Yet we’ve heard comparatively little Jokic banter thus far, despite the fact that through 13 games, his PER of 35.4 ranks … (checks notes) … first all-time.  All. Time.  By a wide margin, actually — the all-time best heading into this year was 31.86 by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019-20. It’s only 13 games, and maybe Jokic’s numbers will dip as the year goes on, but nothing about his start has seemed particularly fluky or weird.  Even relative to the other four players who have been notably awesome in the early part of the season, Jokic has been on a completely different level.  We’re blessed with some awesome players right now, but in terms of production, it’s The Joker’s world. Yet, reading the tea leaves, it already seems very possible Jokic won’t repeat as MVP due to some combination of voter boredom and embarrassing oversight.  (Also, while we’re here: It is an unconscionable, embarrassing mistake that Jokic was left off the league’s top 75 players of all-time list, just to leave room for misty-eyed wistfulness about the fourth-best players on Lakers, Celtics and Knicks teams of yore. “Sure, this Jokic fella is good, but he’s no Dave DeBusschere.”)  The breadth of what The Joker is doing is overwhelming. Skill-wise, he’s the best passer in the league, but he’s also second in rebounding; oh, and he’s shooting 38.3 percent on 3s. And — get this — he’s sixth in scoring, while very nearly leading the league in 2-point shooting percentage at 66.3 percent.  Defensively, he’s less off-the-charts awesome, but his IQ and giant mitts still make him effective. (Fun fact: Jokic has more steals than Giannis, Trae Young or Kevin Durant. He’s in the league’s top 50 in both steal and block rate.) The Nuggets, quietly, are third in the NBA in defensive efficiency despite missing multiple key players, which sort of neutralizes the “WuT AbOUt hIs D?” angle.  In addition to having the best individual stats in the league, Jokic’s impact stats are borderline hilarious. The Nuggets are plus-14.2 points per 100 possessions when he plays, minus-11.6 when he sits, nearly a 26-point swing depending on whether he’s in the game.  The eye test backs up the numbers. He’s steadily improved his doughy physique and now moves better than ever, gliding past opponents in transition and making guard-like moves closer to the rim. As a roller, it’s been interesting to see him use long strides and (gasp!) athleticism to get chances close to the rim rather than ambling into jump hooks like he used to.  And mixed in, of course, are assorted displays of a rare basketball genius. He’s reinventing the game on the fly, doing stuff no big man has ever done and adding to the repertoire as he goes. Oh, here, let me just whip this one-handed, no-look, pick-and-roll dish to a driving Aaron Gordon.  Even as the Nuggets scuffle along in fits and starts through early injuries and bad bench units, Jokic has been unbelievable. Night to night, he’s not just the most effective player in the league, but he also makes at least one mind-blowing play every single game … and everyone just kind of ignores it and goes about the day. Playing in the Rocky Horror Time Zone doesn’t help, but it’s still weird. It doesn’t help that the league still markets him like he’s Mason Plumlee.  Fans of good basketball: Appreciate this guy. He is an awesome, generational talent at the absolute peak of his powers.”"
Have we ever seen prime Aaron Gordon? Not sure that guy has ever existed
I will never not be pissed about Aaron Gordon not having a dunk title. He’s the most insane dunker I’ve ever seen.
Ceiling: Prime Aaron Gordon
Didn’t he tweet something about never doing it after they did Aaron Gordon dirty twice?
"He’s been guarding PGS pretty exclusively this season. He shut down Trae pretty easily, among others. Just Twitter search “Aaron Gordon defense” and watch Malone talk about how he puts AG on “that guy” from every team and how good his impact has been on the production from the stars from each team."
Can’t wait to see how Aaron Gordon matches up! Steph’s not playing the same game as everyone else right now though. Hard to guard a guy whose range begins at the opponent’s 3PT line and runs 20 miles a game.
He reminds me of Aaron Gordon with handles
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
Imagine AD playing where Aaron Gordon plays. All those cuts and lobs from Jokic. Wow
Aaron Gordon should be in the mix. Not top 3 but he’s the core of a much improved defense.
No Aaron Gordon? Weak
"Hypothetically  If you could trade Kyrie and get back Lonzo, Aaron Gordon, Fournier would you trade Kyrie?  ORL would get some picks and Bledsoe from NO who would get Kyrie."
Aaron Gordon
1) Aaron Gordon. Let him be your starting 3. He'd be slightly miscast there but they just need him to guard their best guy and attack the rim (he'd have spacing everywhere else)  2) PJ's a 36 year old expiring deal. Boogie's washed and Oladipo is also an expiring looking for either a max contract or to go to Miami. That leaves John Wall who has a mammoth enough contract that you can't really build around.
"&gt; they have way too much talent to be 3-9   do they? KAT has missed 8/12 games so far, Edwards is having typical rookie struggles, and their only other good players are Russell and Beasley. Everyone else on the team is mediocre at best, and most of them suck on defense.   They didn't make any win-now move to improve from last season, and the West is stacked. I thought maybe they'd try to make a move for like Aaron Gordon or someone, but they haven't done anything. They're winning 40% of their games this year, tops. They need that pick because they simply don't have very much talent."
"Zion, Harden, Kat, and if these still count: Kemba, Vuchi man / Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin"
Can't wait to see him get Aaron Gordon for Nesmith and a first rounder.

Aaron Gordon
hasn’t the “aaron gordon at the 3” experiment failed every time it’s been tried?
"God, I would love him on the Celts although he would definitely be accepting a smaller role in the offense and more effort would be expected on defense. The thought of him taking all those wide open threes instead of Theis is so tantalizing though.   He could be absorbed into the Hayward trade exception, but if I understand correctly we would need to send out some smaller salaries to stay under the hard cap. If we included one or two of our more intriguing young guys hopefully a small pick package would be enough to get it done.  For better or worse though, I hear more people talking about us going for Aaron Gordon, since we already have so many bigs on our roster."
We'll take one Aaron Gordon please and thank you
Aaron Gordon would do well to get away from the Magic. My mans went out and almost won the dunk contest and then went back to playing with Play Doh.
Marvin Bagley Aaron Gordon and kevin porter jr
Aaron Gordon maybe
Aaron Gordon was playing like Ben Simmons in that final minute lmao.
Aaron Gordon looked great in the fourth but I can't help but think he lost them the game near the end
Why did Aaron Gordon have the ball in his hands so much to end the 4th? Felt like he single handily lost them the game
Aaron Gordon taketh away
Aaron Gordon +22 in this game
"He probably needs to go to a new organization. I haven’t watched the Magic in years, but I tuned in when they faced Brooklyn recently and to me Aaron Gordon plays like a rookie—doesn’t have a style, doesn’t make much of an impact, and generally looks happy to be there."
"What’s best about Aaron Gordon is that he lacks exploitable weaknesses, but relative to the best players in the league it’s like he’s not actually great at anything.   If he got a 50pt game it’d be pretty surprising, and that shouldn’t be the case for a guy built his way to just never really get that go-to move."
"Lol this doesn't prove your point at all man. As I said, the first list is primarily 1s/2s, whereas the 2nd list is primarily 2s/3s. Aaron Gordon would never guard Dame. Trevor Ariza would never guard Dame. Shabazz Napier would never guard Luka, etc.  You have a few guys that are SG/SFs that unsurprisingly appear on both lists, because Dame is a pure point guard, whereas Luka is a SF/SG in a pinch. Aka, defensive minded 2s can sometimes guard both, like Jrue, Harris, etc  You are not a point guard if you are never guarding the opposing teams PG unless they're tony allen level offensive players  Idc what Carlisle says. If Stotts said Dame was center, that doesn't make him a center. Luka primarily guards other 3s/2s and almost never guards PGs, whereas Dame primarily guards 1s/2s, and almost never guards 3s - note that the **only** time either strays from their position defensively is in the case of guys who are  poor offensively.  Dame primarily guards the weaker of the 1/2. Luka primarily guards the weaker of the 2/3 - the only reason there is some overlap is because both will guard weak offensive 2 guards."
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
"Aaron Gordon, Mo Bamba, Marvin Bagley"
Aaron gordon hasn’t really lived up to expectations from his first few years.
"I love RHJ! Hope he finds a team soon. My answer would probably be Aaron Gordon. He’s a really good player, but not the all-star level player people thought he could be"
Aaron Gordon says hi
"Aaron Gordon.  Every year is the year he's going to take the leap.  At some point, you have to realize he is who he is.  Stellar defensive role player, but not a potential all star."
NBA players height/weight is so weird in real life. I've only ever seen Aaron Gordon and Tristan Thompson and AG looked like he was malnourished and Tristan Thompson looked a lot smaller than 6'9. Weight looked spot on for Tristan though but I thought he was maybe more like 6'6 than 6'9.
"Okay, let's analyse that timespan then by possession:  1. Harris blows by Fultz and help is stuck with a shooter (Green and Curry) while Aaron Gordon is way too late to help because he either hesitates with Simmons at the top of the key or he reacts way too slow, could be both to me. 2. Simmons brings the ball up, Fultz tries to steal it and gets called for a reach-in. From the inbound, Curry and Embiid attack the basket with 3 guys at the rim except for Gordon who guards Simmons, but he focuses much more on the paint/ball than Simmons. 3. Simmons drives down the lane himself and kicks out to a \*wide open\* Seth Curry who hits the three. Not much here either. 4. Simmons stays in the dunker's spot for nearly the entire possession, Embiid hits the jumper. Not much here either. 5. Simmons runs up the floor, gets attention from two guys, passes to Harris who hits the 3. The attention could also have been to prevent a Simmons drive and open dunk/layup so unclear too, but probably not because of his three-point threat. 6. Simmons brings the ball down the court. At the top of the key, his man (AG again) seems more concerned with getting around the Embiid screen than a Simmons three, despite the large gap between the two. Embiid then makes a gorgeous move to dunk on Vucevic, but Simmons in the dunker's spot didn't have any three-point threat this time either. 7. Curry and Embiid in a pick and pop with Simmons in the corner. His man doesn't seem concerned with a three though, which might be because a pass out to Simmons from Curry's position would have been very risky, but he is at the edge of the paint either way. 8. Simmons isn't at the three-point line at any point in this possession. 9. Simmons drives down the court in transition, gets doubled and passes to a trailing Harris who hits the lightly contested three. 10. Simmons passes at the beginning of the shot clock but stands in the dunkers' spot until he screens for an open three for Shake Milton. 11. Simmons isn't even a part of the offense, as he crosses half court after Harris gets it to Embiid in the paint who earns free throws. 12. Embiid draws a foul early into the shot clock, no special attention for Simmons again.  So I guess you were right, as Simmons didn't get much extra attention (\*maybe\* in that 1st possession I guess) at the three-point line, but he wasn't in that position very often either. A better explanation for this (difference with previous season) would probably be that the Sixers defense got them many transition opportunities (in which Simmons does excel) and that guys like Green, Curry and Shake force guys to think about their shooting before they help out/double Embiid or a driver. Maybe you could bring a bit more to the table to support your argument than just ""lol"" next time I guess."
What is aaron gordon doing in this convo to begin with
Aaron Gordon
Who is Gordon? Aaron Gordon? Gordon Hayward? Eric Gordon?
Lol was that aaron gordon? He didnt move at all after Harden took the screen.
"To top if off they haven't even figured out what to do with Aaron Gordon at that point, was he a SF or PF? Then they went and signed Biyombo as you mentioned for whatever the fuck reason  Rob Hennigan is in the conversation as one of the worst GMs I've ever seen, and I sat through GarPax's bullshit"
Aaron Gordon is such a meh player.
Still no Aaron Gordon.
Aaron gordon as a jump shooter just looks ugly and awkward
Nets should trade for Aaron Gordon.
aaron gordon should be so much better than he is
"I'm digging Aaron Gordon with braids, better look than the fro."
Is Aaron Gordon still  on the annual trade block or has that died down?
"Illyasova was part of the Ibacka trade too, they moved Harris to give Aaron Gordon more playing time. Gordon be the bettet defender and more willing  passer at the time"

"Here you go:   &gt; Dort is morphing from curiosity to basketball player. He has hit 44% of his ceiling-scraping 3s on decent volume -- about 6.5 attempts per 36 minutes -- even though the shot flies so high, the atmosphere might alter its trajectory. He has a bulldozing pump-and-go game, and a surprising ability to decelerate.   &gt;Dort is averaging about 12 drives per 100 possessions, up from eight last season, per Second Spectrum. A cautionary note: Oklahoma City has scored a paltry 0.714 points per possession when Dort shoots out of a drive or dishes to a teammate who fires -- 178th out of 190 players who have recorded at least 20 drives.  &gt; Dort is wild and turnover prone. He has zero midrange game; he is 1-of-10 on shots from between the restricted area and the 3-point arc. Still: it's encouraging to see him stretch himself.  &gt; He remains a growling brick wall on defense. His motor is incredible, and occasionally a little disconcerting.  &gt; Nine guys are playing basketball there. Dort is playing his own game, scrambling around as if someone has challenged him to guard an entire team at once. He denies Evan Fournier an open 3, rides Fournier's hip into the lane, and slashes outside to fly at Dwayne Bacon. He then drifts right to deter a potential pass to Aaron Gordon in the corner, and finally U-turns out to deflect that kickout to Fournier.  &gt; I'm tired just watching that. It looks like someone is controlling Dort with a remote control.  &gt; In conclusion: MAKE THE DORT MINI-LICENSE PLATES!!"
You want to trade the dude who’s arguably playing better then Dame for aaron gordon
Also need to trade CJ tho. Aaron Gordon you up?
"the big names I've seen on the Celtics sub are Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Terrence Ross, PJ Tucker, and most recently Oladipo (even tho dipo is more of a ball handler than a wing)"

I believe he means Aaron Gordon
He should’ve learned from Aaron Gordon.
"Vanderbilt is probably the best we have and odds are he might crack the starting lineup soon.   It was a known issue this roster is missing a 4. We tried to get Millsap, JaMychal Green, Derrick Jones Jr, and Jae Crowder in free agency. Some we couldn't afford but others just chose other teams. We've also been rumored to be probing trades for PJ Tucker, Larry Nance Jr, and Aaron Gordon.  Our GM has been trying but not much has come our way."
"Well the Celtics' biggest weakness is wing depth, but normally people have been thinking Harrison Barnes or Aaron Gordon with the TPE.  Not really thrilled by the idea of Oladipo since that seems like a rental and I doubt he'll be happy there."
Aaron Gordon does not make more money than this entire sub combined
"Aaron Gordon, Demar.  Maybe Vucci Mane?    I don't remember many white centers requesting a trade though, as strange as that sounds."
"Right but again, you will need to find someone to take Thompson into their cap space and you will have to give up a 2nd rounder to get them to do that.  You’ll have to do the same for a smaller (2M ish) salary.  Then we could use the entire TPE and we would need to give up more picks, first rounders this time most likely, to get anyone that would help.  For example, in order to get someone like derozan we would need to give up 1 or 2 first round picks. Same to get someone like Aaron Gordon."
oof I dont know. maybe if that was the only deal I could find but I think id rather get a less reliable defender for less. I kind of stopped paying attention to Aaron Gordon but his offense has always been so bleh
I remember thinking at the time when they traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry that must mean they really arent gonna make a move on Harden because of all this lol.   The problem is this new play in format reduces the number of teams who are gonna be looking to tank post deadline.   This will never happen but hypothetically lets say they keep Maxey would you be willing to do Maxey and Seth Curry for Aaron Gordon. I think I would.
Have fun with Aaron Gordon lol
They had Orlando in white and orange as well made me think Aaron Gordon was on the Suns
Legit thought Aaron Gordon was on the Suns when I saw the clip of him dunking on Giannis yesterday
Aaron Gordon has the potential to be a damn SUPERSTAR!!!!!!  Not while playing in Orlando...

That's NBA dunk champion Aaron Gordon to you sir
I would buy Zach LaVine vs Aaron Gordon dunk rematch on PPV.
I was really confused and started to google when Aaron Gordon was traded to the suns.
Aaron “7 rebs a game” Gordon. No reason why that guy doesn’t dominate the boards
Ok I don't know much about basketball but isn't this an offensive foul because Giannis had position and stood his ground? Aaron Gordon straight up ran into him to dunk the ball.
That’s unofficial 2 time dunk contest champion Aaron Gordon for you!
It’s too bad Aaron Gordon has only proven to be “just a dunker” so far in his career. I feel like we only hear about him when he dunks the ball. He needs a new environment IMO.
Aaron Gordon posterizing Giannis ended up being like shooting Mongo in Blazing Saddles for the Bucks.
3x dunk contest participant Aaron Gordon still isn't producing much on the court
Aaron Gordon deserves to be on the All defensive team.  He’s incredible.  Even Bucks fans can agree with that.
remember when Aaron Gordon said the same thing last year or the year before.
I never understood it. He  comes up big when needed and some people were advocating trading him for AARON GORDON

Aaron Gordon has zero touch and never will
Much credit to Aaron Gordon. Dude was swarming
He’s actually the same age as D’angelo Russell and Aaron Gordon which feels weird to me
"&gt; You don’t want him guarding the other team’s best offensive players  he's guarded Paul George, John Wall, James Harden, Jimmy Butler and Aaron Gordon all successfully so far this season."
I want an Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon gave him a really hard time
aaron gordon redux
I.e. Dallas should trade for Aaron Gordon.
Ahh the Aaron Gordon special
The Aaron Gordon special
I remember when Aaron Gordon did the same thing lol
"Aaron Gordon on 28 Oct 2017: “People aren’t going to take us lightly and if they do, we’re going to blow them out.” The Magic then went 7-19"
is aaron gordon good now?
This years Aaron Gordon award goes to John Collins and the Atlanta Hawks
Didn't realize Aaron Gordon was rocking a fro
Don’t forget other comparisons from that draft lol.   Joel Embiid was next Olajuwon and Aaron Gordon was the next Blake Griffin.   One of the more overhyped draft classes haha
Aaron Gordon Justise Winslow Jordan Bell
We’ll give you Tremont Waters knees for Aaron Gordon
Where's Aaron Gordon?
Aaron Gordon maybe
Aaron Gordon was robbed by DWade for Derrick Jones.
"He was a top-5 pick, and there were plenty of guys taken after him that did much better  Isn't the definition of a bust a player that has high expectations coming into the league, taken with a high pick and then fails miserably  Teams aren't looking for a role player with a top-5 selection, they want a star or at least a starting caliber guy. Aaron Gordon is probably a decent baseline for what a top-5 pick should be"
Just your daily reminder: Aaron Gordon didn't clear Tacko on that dunk...like at all.
fuck dwade for robbing aaron gordon of a slam dunk champ title
Lmao someone tell this to Aaron gordon
Jarrett Culver + Juancho Hernangomez + Filler for Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon even said that prep for the dunk contest took attention away from the season in the past
"The dunk contest as a whole (Unless Aaron Gordon is involved) has been really disappointing for a long time now. Specifically though, I honestly don't like Kenny Smith's announcing. He's good in the studio, but when he tries to become a hype man at All-Star weekend it becomes annoying imo."
I wish the dunk contest would go on hiatus. Lavine aaron Gordon is the only good one in the past few years.    Maybe they can bring it back in five years and hype it up as nostalgia.
"It’s already an issue, and will continue to be until he is finally traded for Aaron Gordon."
I know a guy who partied with Aaron Gordon and said the same thing 😂
"I think Orlando is an even better example at how hard it is to pick outside of the top-2, even if you have a high pick:        2013: Victor Oladipo #2 overall (not bad, but traded him before he broke out)       2014: Aaron Gordon #4 overall         2015: Mario Hezonja #5 overall         2016: Domantas Sabonis #11 overall (traded to OKC)               2017:  Jonathan Isaac #6 overall           2018: Mo Bamba #6 overall"
"I'm okay with shipping him along with Lonnie being honest, getting someone like Aaron Gordon in return doesn't sound unrealistic to me"
Lowry did it to Aaron Gordon and he got called dirty.  Just because it isn’t dirty doesn’t mean it isn’t reckless and doesn’t mean it isn’t a flagrant. In every level of basketball taking a guy out from behind like this is a flagrant.
"lmao probably nothing of value. Barnes would be cool, same with Aaron Gordon or maybe Thad Young. I don’t think any of them make us good enough for it to be worth it though. Only hope for this team is KAT requesting a trade or trying to get Vucevic w the TPE this off-season, neither of which is realistic for this season though"
"Magic are missing their projected starting PF, SF, PG. Vuc's second best teammates this year have been Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier, who have both missed time. Compare them to Turner and Brogdon. If it means usage is higher, it also means that he is getting much more defensive attention and double teams. Sabonis is shooting a higher percentage and has a couple of more assists per game but Vucecic is better or same at everything else. More points, more 3s, better FT% with equal RPG, SPG, BPG.   Not saying one is definitely better than other. To me they've both been pretty equal in terms of value."
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"He still might. But injuries + lack of playing time. With Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, Jonathan Isaacs (not this season), it’s hard for him to get good minutes"
"His shooting numbers will look bad all season long cuz of a few really had games. But he looked good yesterday, and the 3 games before the Pels he was the old Kemba again. He also won us the Clippers game in the 2nd half. Just give him time to find his consistency.   Team defense improves with Smart + a wing traded to us. The biggest difference between last years team and this years is that we don’t have Hayward. That’s why our defense has been bad. We’re trying to run a switch everything system without enough wings who can switch everything. I know Barnes isn’t a great defender, but neither was Hayward and Barnes also is 6’8 250 lb and athletic (if it’s Aaron Gordon then even better on D). Having that guy there to fill a huge role in perimeter defense helps our interior defense by being more competitive on dribble penetration. It’ll require us to have less off ball switching. He’ll take a 4th option role on offense (think JB last year) which will take some burden off our top guys letting them focus their energy on D more.  Team ball movement is bad right now because we’re missing the best playmaker on the team in Smart. Too often we’re forced to roll with offensive zeros on the court in Javonte and TT (center rotation will shorten with more wings) which also hurts our ball movement by allowing the D to focus in on our top guys.  So yea I don’t think we’re a JJ away from a contender, he’s been terrible this year. I don’t think we’re a KP away, he doesn’t fit our team too well. But a Barnes/Aaron Gordon + Romeo + more consistent Kemba, maybe. Guys can put us over the top even if they’re the 5th guy on the team by taking the load off the best players.   I think we all fancied ourselves as title contenders last season. So let’s go out and replace the dude we lost. Obviously no one is fully replacing Hayward. But we can sure do the next best thing and hope that our top guys can step it up."
"The magic have 3 of their regular starters out for either the whole season or for a very long period (Aaron Gordon). Fournier has also barely played. For the pacers, Sabonis, Brogdon, and Turner (besides the brief absence for the hand injury), have been healthy. The magic are the most depleted roster in the league and it’s not particularly close"
Aaron Gordon in shambles
"Lakers only had 2. Toronto had 1 good one plus a lot of ok ones. What you need for a title changes with the quality of the rest of the league. Really there’s only one true big 3 in the league (Brooklyn) and they also have worse depth than us.   Kemba’s been playing well as of late sans the Pels game. He’s been getting much better and looks good physically. If he’s not playing like he was last season then it doesn’t matter who we get, we’re not contenders anyways.  I get that rotations shorten in the playoffs but we still need at least one other wing (preferably 2). Going 2 big so often in the playoffs is risky, but even if we do we still gotta have a dude come in to spell the Jays. We can’t be running 2 guard with 2 big lineups in the playoffs. Defensively our team works best with 3 switchable wings to guard tight on the perimeter and not let guys get to the paint. It worked great last season with Hayward and then Theis could man the paint while switching on PnR. The defense works less well with him as the 3rd wing and a less switchable big being attacked in PnR.  We don’t need to use all 28 right now, it can be split up. Also we’re hard capped (around 18 available) cuz of TT’s contract. Think targeting Harrison Barnes would be awesome or even Aaron Gordon. Just to get another big wing on the perimeter who’s better than Semi."
"Id go Capela over Warren. Warren had a decent run for a bit last year and that’s it. I’d go Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, Jordan Clarkson and would debate Joe &amp; Gary Harris over Warren too from that draft class."
I’m a week older than Aaron Gordon  Do you have any idea how mentally taxing that is
"The hype that the 2014 draft class had is finally starting to show. Now we gotta get Wiggins, Jabari, Aaron Gordon and Dante Exum to the all star game"
"If portland really wanted to shake things up they could do something like CJ + Nurkic and a first for Aaron Gordon and Vucevic. Dame-GT-Covington-Gordon-Vucevic is a more balanced starting 5 imo. Magic get younger with Nurkic and gain a high level shot creator who would flourish with his own team, and draft compensation."
I can't believe I forgot Ben Simmons and Mikal Bridges for on ball.  They are probably better than Aaron Gordon.  Gordon would be like 7th.
On ball  OG Dort Marcus Smart Aaron Gordon Jrue Holiday  Off Ball  Giannis Davis Gobert Embiid Jonathon Isaac
Aaron Gordon in last year’s slam dunk contest
"Many players like that.  Celtics sub: We NEED Aaron Gordon for this team, it’ll be great, he’s a missing piece!  Magic sub: take him!"
I think it's time to ask ourself who's better between Aaron Gordon and Lebron james.
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
"There's just a hesitancy to tank in Orlando. Wasn't Steve Clifford specifically brought in to lead them to the playoffs?  They've obviously hit their ceiling as a perennial 8th seed, but also the rest of the East has made enough progress that even when healthy there's no guarantee that they'd be a lock for the playoffs.  Fournier is an expiring and I can see him moving on. That might be enough to get the ball rolling on shipping out Aaron Gordon too. I don't think they can get a good return on Vooch though - every team wants him but only for peanuts.  Fultz and JI are the future of the Magic moving forward, just hope they recover well."
Sports Illustrated had him ranked 75th in the NBA.  https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/14/top-100-nba-players-2021-daily-cover  Players ranked ahead of Lavine:  * PJ Tucker * Aaron Gordon * Bojan Bagdanovic * Blake Griffin
"So what you what you will, but I am more impress by a little guy who can dunk and still pull off a trick than I am of someone who is 6'6. Unless it's Aaron Gordon and Zach lavine."
"And what if he does? A lot of players are overvalued in relation to their skillset because of their popularity. Nate Robinson, Aaron Gordon and Spud Webb are a lot more widely known than some career 15-5-5 players. Vince Carter's name is taken in the same breath as Kobe and Tmac among 2000s wings only because of his high flying heroics. The NBA is an entertainment industry. The top entertainers will always be valued. We're talking about a league that keeps introducing rules to stop unrelatable freaks of nature from completely dominating other players for crying out loud."
Hopefully. Aaron Gordon is still out with injury for a few weeks so I could see it happening
Aaron Gordon is that you?
like maybe Steve Nash and Aaron Gordon lmao but I don't get what that does for Kareem considering he was already unstoppable around the basket anyway.
Really Aaron Gordon you could have at least said Kobe or Vince
All I seen was a bunch of HOF level players and then somehow Aaron Gordon got involved
Aaron Gordon deserved to beat Lavine in the dunk contest
"The most annoying are typically the biggest fanbases, because the more people you get together circlejerking, the more the per capita circlejerking increases due to mob mentality.   In my personal experience, the Lakers and Raps fans can be quite annoying.  I remember as a Raps fanboy, it was cringey watching people excuse Lowry's dumb play on Aaron Gordon in the bubble and how they all flipped out about Aaron retaliating this year. Pure homerism."
You really think people hate Lowry because he’s “loved by players and by Toronto fans”? oh please  &gt;	There are way worse dirty players than Lowry. A hard foul isn’t dirty. Aaron Gordon is just soft   Very good
"No, people just hate Lowry because he loved by the players and by Toronto fans, but anyone outside of that think he doesn't deserve his accolades.   There are way worse dirty players than Lowry. A hard foul isn't dirty. Aaron Gordon is just soft and is currently writing his next diss track on youtube to slander Lowry right now."
&gt;Your own boy Kyle Lowry has a history of dangerous plays against Aaron Gordon  okay shaq lmfao
"I mean I can pull out some clips of almost every player in the league getting a flagrant 2. Your own boy Kyle Lowry has a history of dangerous plays against Aaron Gordon, doesn’t mean I think he’s dirty. But whatever helps you sleep at night."
"There’s a 3pt contest so I feel like there should be a dunk contest. I want DJJ, Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Zion"
"But the situation they currently are in might make them tank. They are 2.5 games out of the 8th seed but they will need another full reset sooner or later. That reset will likely involve ditching Vuc and Aaron Gordon unfortunately. Maybe they don't trade them during the season but I'd bet on one or both being traded this offseason.   My personal dream is Celtics trading for Vuc, him becoming a 35 minutes per game guy for us with Robert Williams developing into great back up for 15-20 minutes a game"
"People know what Aaron Gordon is, I don’t know what his value is but i’ll give him up for a first in a heartbeat"

"Aaron Gordon, Zion"
"Recently it was Wiggins.  Currently, Ben seems like the obvious one. I kinda wanna see what Kuzma would be like if he were a main focus. Aaron Gordon is someone I can see being in this category but I'm not actually invested enough in him to actually wonder if he should be somewhere else or not if that makes any sense"
the nuggets should trade for aaron gordon
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
"Vince is retired now but a couple of years ago, he definitely got shat on in this very Reddit for it. Hyper athlete that showed a lot of promise only to get caught middling and never taking it up a notch. Still though, Vince isn't the first guy to not live up to their potential despite the tools and he wouldn't be the last. Vince was obviously a significantly better but Aaron Gordon is probably the best example right now. Dude has insane athleticism and has decent handles, shown flashes of a jumpshot but never putting it together at the same time for a long enough period."
Aaron Gordon honestly... watch his smile during the games
"...legit their entire team has been hurt. Fournier is coming back, Aaron Gordon is coming back"
I'm pretty sure that's not the Aaron Gordon losing
"Lonzo, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, Aaron Gordon, and AD at the 5"
$1 Lonzo  $4 Jaylen Brown  $4 Jimmy Butler  $1 Aaron Gordon  $5 Jokic
Fox holiday kawhi Anthony Davis Aaron Gordon   Cheating but I like this lineup
Lol we make the playoffs if half the team wasn't dead with injuries.  People like to talk about the Markelle injury but conveniently omit that MCW our other point guard also got injured around that time.  So we had to play Aaron Gordon as a backup point guard.  Even if we just have Cole Anthony with MCW I think we make the playoffs.
"And then OP mentions MCW as the ""floor general"" that's going to take them over the top?   The answer is a 3rd string PG from a 10-18 team that was forcing Aaron Gordon (before he got hurt) to play point forward?"
"No, Aaron Gordon is never going to get traded.  One vastly overrated player on that salary.  LMA would be a nice though."
"Nah, he's slowly coming back. He postered Aaron Gordon and almost did the same to Theis. This time he had to go for a layup because the contact before stopped his momentum."
"At some point our sub got full of toxic waste and you can see it pouring out here. It’s full of people wanting to trade the whole team, fire Danny, fire Brad and pin all our hopes on getting Aaron Gordon. Or ridiculous trade scenarios for Harrison Barnes, Vucevic or Porzingis. Players that aren’t even viably available."
"I was being serious. I want to know OP’s definition of a role player so I can answer the fucking question. If they think Robert Covington and Aaron Gordon are Role Players, then The next step up from them would be borderline all-star quality players."
Does Aaron Gordon have a defined role other than being a really good athlete that isn’t very good at basketball?
"No stars (unless they give an absolute haul of picks), but could get an Aaron Gordon/Lamarcus Aldridge type. Could maybe go balls to the walls and grab Vooch? Would definitely be far more expensive"
"Sadly, those numbers are what 5 years/80m get you these days...if that. Kyle Lowry has been pretty shit for the stupid money he makes, and I’m not even sure Aaron Gordon is still in the league."
If you ask any person who they think of when they hear the words “air” and “basketball” I promise you Aaron Gordon ain’t it. A lot of your list just comes down to lack of creativity by whoever calls the second dude someone else’s nickname.
Between stars maybe. But I promise TJ Warren hates Jimmy Butler. And Kyle Lowry and Aaron Gordon hate each other
I mean he’s hurt right now but Bamba doesn’t deserve minutes over Aaron Gordon and won’t deserve minutes over Isaac when he’s back next year. And then they’re playing guys like Chuma Okeke and Khem Burch over him. You have to think they’re seeing something in practice we’re not. There’s most likely a reason he isn’t getting minutes.
"Aaron Gordon; Wil Barton, Hartenstein, 2021 2nd rnd pick, 2022 2nd rnd pick for Aaron Gordon + Mo Bamba."
"Aaron Gordon wouldn’t even require mpj.  Earlier in yr when siakams value was down and Toronto wasn’t winning, I liked a siakam idea even if it meant giving up mpj.  Likely doesn’t happen now"
"Happens in bball man. Chris Paul, Reggie Miller, Michael Jordan, Blake Griffin, Aaron gordon come to mind. The younger brother has to grow up faster to play with their big bro/sis and thus has to develop more skills"
Raise your hand if you have as much dunk contest wins as Aaron Gordon 🖐️🖐️
That's 3x Dunk Contest Participant Aaron Gordon
5 years ago Aaron Gordon had the best dunk ever*
"I feel like PJ would be great you guys, but I don’t think Houston does it for less than a 1st. Aaron Gordon would have been the ideal target, but I’m not sure since his injury."

"*Aaron Gordon standing in the wings with a remote, decked out head-to-toe in Intel gear.*"
"in a 3 way trade, bulls get jalen brunson, mavs get aaron gordon, and the magic get shafted"
Remember when people were mad that we gave him more than Aaron Gordon?
"White men can’t jump. There are tons of examples, such as Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin, and Tyler Johnson /s"
Yeah people are really going to miss Aaron Gordon try 6 times to dunk off a drone presented by Intel™️
Kyle Lowry has as many dunk contest titles as bumass Aaron Gordon
"That whole season was amazing. Curry going supernova in the regular season and the Warriors break MJ's 72-10 record. Kobe's final season, scoring 60 points in the final game. OKC taking down a 67 win Spurs team in the WCSF, warriors comeback against OKC in the WCF down 3-1, only to have the same thing done to them against the Cavs in the finals. On top of that, probably the greatest dunk contest in recent history between Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine. 2016 was just a good year in general."
I would honestly have Aaron Gordon over Jonathon Isaac personally.  AG is a better on ball defender and is pretty good with his help still.  Isaac is an elite help defender but is kind of below average on ball.
Only one of these that made me go “i guess maybe” was DAngelo Russell for Aaron Gordon. And even then ehh
Watch it be some bum like Aaron Gordon
"They would need a roster on par with like the 2019 Raptors or current Jazz talent wise where 1-8 every dude is solid. Dame, Trent, CJ, Nurkic, Melo, and Covington are all solid. The Derrick Jones Jr role is the weak link, but he would be fine off the bench. Rodney Hood was also playing crunch time minutes for them and I just don't have much faith in him anymore. Even when Zach Collins is healthy he wouldn't be enough. They need defense. The dream replacement would be Draymond but that will never happen. The only hope would be to take a gamble on an Aaron Gordon type player or younger and hope you can turn them into Draymond lite. I don't see Dame and CJ breaking up either. It's not like CJ would fetch much. If you could replace CJ with like Gordon Hayward or Jaylen Brown that might help but again I would doubt that would happen. Maybe Myles Turner? But that may just create more problems."
Im still angry at you. D. Wade for not letting Aaron Gordon win the dunk contest
"Aaron Gordon is effectively TJ Warren lite. They play the same position in the offense, except Aaron is a better athlete and TJ is a craftier scorer. TJ is also more efficient than Aaron.  The only reason a Pacers fan would want AG is because they've forgotten how good TJ Warren was for us when healthy."
"Some famously injury prone players would be Blake, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, AD, Cousins and Kristaps. Some others would be Bagley, Kevin Love, Marcus Smart, Gallinari, and Aaron Gordon."
"The idea that Portland is one Aaron Gordon away from contending is some good shit, thanks for that."
"Gotta think it's a team with players we know are musically gifted..  Rockets have Oladipo singing, Magic have Aaron Gordon who's a piano prodigy. And there's a tonne of rappers in the league"
he wont be an afterthought if they can force their way into a top 2/3 seed.  right now they just dont have the record.  think hes going to get a big boost now that theyre getting healthy and if they snag someone like aaron gordon at the deadline.
"tbf, aaron gordon is at least a pretty damn good defender generally. cant lump em in with those other guys imo"
"3 team trade  Indiana gets: Aaron Gordon, ???  Orlando gets: JJ Reddick, salary filler, two FRPs from NO  New Orleans gets: Myles Turner"
He’s better than Aaron Gordon
"Everyone's talking bout Aaron Gordon, Thad Young is a guy we need"
Larry Nance Jr/John Collins/Jeremi Grant/Aaron Gordon   I think the pattern is clear...
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
He absolutely will be able to. I think he's still 18 months away from being a consistent starter but that would match up with us potentially trading for Aaron Gordon. Then eventually we could trade Gordon for bench depth and let JMac run wild
Pacers get: Larry Nance Jr. Javale McGee 2022 top 8 protected 1st  Cavs get : Aaron Gordon  Magic get: Miles Turner
"Defensive 4s off the top of my head that MAY be available for trade: Theis, Pj Washington, OPJ/Thad, Millsap, Aldridge, Tucker, Aaron Gordon, Nance"
Is Aaron Gordon worth that much.
i assume they could turn around and offer one of the picks for Aaron Gordon and hope Orlando is finally willing to give up their fight for the 10th seed
I've been open to trading either Turner or Sabonis for a while but the issue is we'd need a defensive-minded power forward back.  I would've been fine to roll the dice on a Hayward trade but that didn't work out. I'm a bit more open to someone like Aaron Gordon now since Sabonis has developed a 3-point shot but I don't know if that actually makes us better or not.
"Works in the trade machine:  Portland gets: Aaron Gordon, James Ennis  Orlando gets: Gary Trent Jr, Rodney Hood, Zac Collins"
"Portland gets: Aaron Gordon, James Ennis  Magic get: Rodney Hood, Gary Trent Jr. , Zac Collins  ???"
Dubs about to trade Oubre for Aaron Gordon
Jokic worst plus minus on the team? Time to trade him for Aaron Gordon?
when aaron gordon wins 2021 finals mvp w the pistons i’ll be back in this thread to shit on u bud
"Theis and the TimeLord are a perfectly fine big man duo. TT a sieve on defense who isn’t quite athletic enough to be superswitchy or big enough to stop opposing C’s. Most fans would rather Grant Williams be our third string center at this point, maybe get a big body on a minimum contract. No interest in paying TT $10 million next year.   C’s actual need is playable wing depth. Hence interest in Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, etc. We’d rather Semi not need to play 15 minutes in a close playoff game (although his shooting is being underrated by our fans right now)"
"The interest in Dwight Powell makes a lot of sense, that way they still have one player who looks like Aaron Gordon"
Bruh what? That's way too much for fucking Aaron Gordon. Picks and 1 player is enough
Aaron Gordon has been in the league for 7 seasons all on the same team and I have no idea how good he really can be.
"I feel like SF/PF tweener guys are the ones that suit the rim protecting wings. Guys who were considered awkward fits at the 3 and too small for 4 20 years ago who've fully slid into the 4 now. IMO Thad Young would be an SF 20 years ago and so would Aaron Gordon, Covington etc. They protect the rim by playing a free safety, shot blocking and helping from behind role, not necessarily by standing under the rim. Not disagreeing, that's just how I define rim protecting wing in my opinion."
"There's value in playing with adults, even more value when they're actually good because their voice carries more. All the young guys will learn a lot playing with him. Cole Anthony is going to be better in the long run throwing entry passes to Vuc than idk, Mahinmi or something. Aaron Gordon would be a more ideal player to trade given the clean line of succession to Isaac. Fournier too, he plays a more disposable role."
Spurs? Aldridge and Aaron Gordon swap?
"I think his value right now is lower than it’ll ever be. When he comes back then he could be worth a lot, but as a currently injured &amp; injury-prone player, he isn’t worth much. He’s already been injured [20 times](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/aaron-gordon-player-injuries) lol"
Eric Bledsoe for Aaron Gordon is more to my liking but Magic would laugh at that
"Danny Ainge: ""We nearly traded for Aaron Gordon, twice!"""
Aaron Gordon is a bum.  What the fuck is taking him so long to be even decent?
Aaron Gordon played the 3 in most of his time with Isaac
"no clue tbh. Gary Harris for Aaron Gordon swap works salary wise, and we could attach a few picks to that as well."
You mean Aaron Gordon?
Aaron Gordon has nearly been traded every day since about 2018
Aaron Gordon to Denver I am manifesting it 🙏
"also did you [see this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2936163-rival-nba-execs-see-major-trade-opportunity-in-orlandos-available-stars), werent you the one who months ago said you would trade Caris LeVert for Aaron Gordon. Apparently the Nets tried! Article says ""before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure.""  So it sounds like they wanted LeVert and more than a bottom 2020 first perhaps back then.   Also sounds like he's generating more buzz than Vucevic: ""Vucevic's market does not seem nearly as vast.'"
"Drummond has passed the torch to Aaron Gordon as the perennial ""he's only ___ years old"" guy"
Worse. So much worse. Aaron Gordon is not a good basketball player. He makes up for his skill shortcomings and lack of BBIQ with athleticism.
"yeah bro uhh naw. Fultz was looking like an above average point guard before he got injured, Isaac was also a top 5 defender in the entire nba and cole anthony was a solid back up as well. Plus aaron gordon generally being good and fournier providing reliable scoring. And i’m a heat fan"
"Can’t forget trae young, Steph curry, isiah Thomas, Bam, Aaron Gordon, and Tony snell."
Aaron Gordon.
A little bit too late for that. And now the dunk contest is going to be weak for the the upcoming years. Aaron Gordon got robbed in 2020 and now he's not going to participate any more and new dunkers are not going to be creative and not score 50's like Aaron Gordon did.
"They were missing Aaron Gordon, Fournier, Ross, James Ennis, Cole Anthony, Isaac, and Fultz tonight. There's only so much you can do with such a crippled roster"
Aaron Gordon over mascot
Aaron Gordon under his butt over the mascot
Aaron Gordon spinning mascot. Or John Collins demolishing a paper mache plane
"That would be a horrible overpay. I wonder if the Magic would move Aaron Gordon for him, they need a guard and AG is (in theory) spare parts with Isaac starting"
The franchise would rest in the hands of... *checks notes* Aaron Gordon.  Hinkie would have been shot by now
"I like the fit of Collins in Minny but the Wolves are in no position to trade future firsts.  Aaron Gordon would've been a beautiful fit on the Wolves and I'm kinda sad to see that the Magic didn't trade him last offseason.   Minny owned Brooklyn's pick which was like #17 in the previous draft; that, a high second and salary match would've been a great return for Gordon. But, the Magic still aren't ready to blow it up and I think they were holding out for a lottery pick which you just aren't going to get for AG."
You'll need a defensive PF aka Larry Nance/Aaron Gordon type
Aaron Gordon?
even if he won he would still be criticized for not being on the same level as Zach Lavine or Aaron Gordon
Why does Aaron Gordon insist on taking the ugliest fade away I've ever seen?
The Aaron Gordon of centers.
Just stop.  Aaron Gordon took huge strides this years as a playmaker and his defense has always been elite.  If anything Isaac has been overrated by everyone until he suddenly became this great offensive player in the bubble.  And Markelle improved big time this year.  We just lack consistent shooting. We really need to load up on shooters instead of pure dense types or whatever it is that Dwayne Bacon does.
"Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, probably could get some guys from the Rockets(Gordon, Tucker, Oladipo, maybe Wood would be available), Pacers(Brogdon &amp; Myles Turner), Demar Derozan, Aaron Gordon, John Collins, Kevin Love &amp; another piece from Cavs. Lotta help out there."
Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon been to the playoffs twice
"I think Vuc and Magic org likes each other.   Magic has a lot of injuries, that's why they regressed. They where up and coming IMO when Isaac showed growth. Then they were winning games with Fultz, but he got injured as well... It sucked to see those guys go  down. I like the Cole Anthony pick and I think they're going to be fine, if they get everyone back.   Maybe look for the right deal with Aaron Gordon and/or Evan Fournier? I think it's the right call to be patient and wait for their injured players to get back on the court."
"""Aaron Judge come on man. This is the nba subreddit. His name is Aaron Gordon"
But what the fuck can the King's realistically do with a TPE? I don't think a team is wanting to drop a player while the Kings are able to find real use for that player. Maybe Aaron Gordon but that may cost draft capital
"&gt; Based on what?  Based on their defensive skill sets.   &gt; Im telling you what Milwaukee did. They clearly thought Fournier was someone worth targeting on defense, they did it and it worked.   And I’m trying to explain to you why using a 5 game bubble sample for a guy coming off covid who played like shit all around relative to his general standards is an absurd way to judge defensive value. Fournier was targeted in both the milwaukee and Toronto series because of our lack forward depth that meant he had to switch onto or even straight up match up with dudes like siakam, Kawhi, and giannis. That is not an issue for the lakers. In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier.   &gt; Fournier guarding the opponents top option frequently is a byproduct of Orlando's roster not his actual defensive capabilities. Who else is going to chase Dame Lillard around a million screens, Aaron Gordon?  In theory it should be markelle fultz, the 6’4” hyper athletic young point guard. But it’s not because Evan is a very good defender and his size bothers guards a lot on the perimeter. Another funny thing to point out is that you’re saying our perimeter personnel is trash defensively and that’s the only reason Fournier gets the best assignment, but we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years, despite our other back court defenders being Fultz, DJ Augustin, terrence ross, so clearly he’s doing something right. If we were just getting torched on the perimeter every night that couldn’t be true."
"Based on what? Im telling you what Milwaukee did. They clearly thought Fournier was someone worth targeting on defense, they did it and it worked. Nobody targets KCP like that. I actually think Fournier is more competent off ball defensively than on ball.   Fournier guarding the opponents top option frequently is a byproduct of Orlando's roster not his actual defensive capabilities. Who else is going to chase Dame Lillard around a million screens, Aaron Gordon? Fultz didnt even always close games last yr"
"He can be considered an all star by the public sure because we all know he is more than good enough to be all star talent. But should he officially get the accolade on his resume? I don’t think so because he didn’t take part in it. If Aaron Gordon tells the world a year later he’s gonna participate in the dunk contest then he gets hurt and replaced, is he still a dunk contest participant?"
So more like if Aaron Gordon played the role that the Nets are hoping Blake Griffin can play.
I think that's OP's idea but I don't think that's what would happen in actuality. I think realistically you get teams playing 4 out super small heavy shooting lineups with 1 big rim protector. Unlike when the 3 second previously didn't exist there are now tons of shooters. Like I think we may see someone like Terrence Ross playing the 4 while Aaron Gordon is basically out of the league.
"Picks, whatever else Orlando would like, I’d do anything to get just JI next to Zion and BI let alone Aaron Gordon."
One of my favorite jrue defensive highlights is him clamping Aaron Gordon in the post.
Yep. Compare him to Aaron Gordon.
"Judges choice is great because we saw Aaron Gordon lose because he and LaVine/JonesJr kept doing 10/10 dunks even though Gordon's were a little better. He would have won if they did judges choice, but instead it became who did a 9 first. This is a flaw with star ratings and yelp reviews too. Since there's a maximum score, a restaurant with ten five star reviews where people thought the meal was solid will look better than a restaurant with nine five stars from people who thought it was the best meal of their life plus one four star review."
"I must be reading this wrong, but the Magic’s draft history is pretty nuts   John Issac, Sabonis, Saric, Aaron Gordon, Oladipo, Kyle O’Quinn, Courtney Lee, JJ Redick, Varejao, Dwight, Mike Miller, Chris Weber, and Shaq. That’s what, 14 half decent players, and Kyle O’Quinn, in a 30ish year history? And I’m gonna go out on a limb and call Cole Anthony a steal also  So yeah, trade the dude for picks."
They 100% should.....They are going nowhere.....Fultz and Isaac could potentially never be the same after tearing their ACL's.....Aaron Gordon is never going to take it to the next level.....Mo bamba hasnt improved at all....might as well get all you can for Vuc and Fornier while they are still valuable.
"Aaron Gordon. 3-0 with his new team. All seriousness, Jokic. He’s the best player this, Nuggets climb to the three seed it’s a wrap."
Statistically ive heard aaron gordon is one of the best at guarding lebron. So thats a definite improvement there

"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
"What does that even mean bruh. Aaron gordon had crazy hype and physique too, just because he didn't reach it doesn't mean he isn't a good role player. Same with jr smith   Forget all that off court shit. Wiggins is a good role player"
A week ago the answer would be Aaron Gordon
"Trent does not really seem to have all-star potential... He seems like a potential Aaron Gordon type player that is a really solid all-around starter, but not a star."
"How is Clippers a better team? You're bringing up regular season as if that fucking matters, it's the regular season. You think Jazz are actually the best team in the league?   Point is Clips brand of basketball doesn't and won't translate in the playoffs. Over reliance on jumpshots and isos. They get none of the easy looks that teams with actual playmakers get. Their defense isn't as good as it should be. Clips just have too many red flags, while Denver has little to none after getting Aaron Gordon to fill in the Jerami Grant role.   The real question is, what makes Clips a better team than Denver to you? I surely hope pointless regular season wins aren't your argument."
"Jokic is even better than before, MPJ has improved his defence and is a solid rim protector. They got Aaron Gordon. I’d say they’re definitely better this year"
He needs to play more offball. He'd look incredible in nuggets playing a similar role like Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon has been balling tf out after getting traded from being the 1st option to the 4th.
"Man IDGAF about those series lol it’s super hard to not like Denver regardless of what team you rep.   Joker, Murray, MPJ, Bol Bol and now Aaron Gordon.   You guys play your cards right you could end up being the NBA sweethearts"
"Idk Lakers Have... Dennis, KCP, Bron, AD, Andre Drummond.   Bron &gt; Jokic  AD &gt;&gt; Murry   Andre &lt; MPJ   Dennis &gt;= Aaron Gordon  KCP &lt; Barton   So the best players on the lakers are better than the best on the nuggets while the other 3 players are all pretty close with slight edges to nuggets players."
Aaron Gordon gonna be shooting bong commercials on top of Pike's Peak
"It’s not any fault of ur teams lol look at Aaron Gordon leaving Orlando or Christian wood leaving the pistons. Sometimes teams have better situations and utility for players, and tbh, I don’t think anyone would argue the wolves are even above average in putting their people in a position to succeed. Wiggins was and to this day, not even close to his potential, that’s his own fault, but he’s decently better with the warriors for real reasons"
&gt;But in a fully healthy scenario I'd still take our team over yours 10/10 times  Yeah because you have Aaron Gordon at PF and we've been playing SG's there all season long.
Aaron Gordon is the perfect example...Hes putting up almost the exact same numbers as he did in Orlando now all of a sudden hes a great player. This sub cant get enough of him...Thats because he is the 4/5th best option instead of the 2nd. Funny how that works.
Aaron Gordon addition to Denver making you guys look scary as fuck
"Remember when people tried to disrespect Aaron Gordon, saying trade deadline is hyping him like he's prime Scottie Pippen?"
"Weeeeell jok did fine against AD last year. Drummond old as balls, not that he’s not a fine defender but he’s not some lock down guy. Plus jok doesn’t need to score for the team to be successful (like we saw last night.) Aaron Gordon also had the fewest points scored against him by Lebron on average since 2015. So AG 100% is covering lebron and he’s very very good"
"Aaron legit did try for a period this year, he's always been like this. The Magic had a stalwart defense for a long time - anyone who thought they were bad were ignorant.  The problem is 40% of our starting lineup tore their ACL in the first month of the year. It was just monumentally deflating. As long as there weren't any disasters, there was a chance for a 50 win season.  I will say I don't think the Magic's offensive system benefited Gordon though. This I think was mostly due to how Vuc &amp; Fournier play. I love me some Vuc &amp; Fournier, but we really needed to re-jig our offensive system to be more dynamic. It was frankly way too predictable."
"Lmao Lakers got Drummond and AD to suffocate Jokic. Do u even follow the league?  And Aaron Gordon ain't guarding LeBron lol. Last year they said jeramj grant, didn't work. No one can guard LeBron really, he's still gonna get his points  And the fact that u think nuggets have no chance against the nets who haven't developed chemistry between their big 3 says a lot about how much u follow the game"
"Yeah he has help now. He was carrying in the first part of the season because Jamal was injured and MPJ had not developed on defense and their chemistry was off, but now that Jamal and Barton are healthy and they got Aaron Gordon, yes Jokic has help"
You wont have dwight howard hugging jokic anymore. I think aaron gordon could potentially be your anti-lebron.  Nets... no chance. They are too fucking stacked.
on the 3 he is bad aaron gordon has already impacted mpj hugely imo. seems like he is motivating him
"Teams are generally always going to give a center space because you don't want your center all the way out on the perimeter but when it's kawhi switched on to him I don't think that's the right decision, and it looks especially questionable juxtaposed with his defense on Aaron Gordon"
"LMAO nice examples of good recent dunk contest, Dwight Howard from 13 years ago I guess fits in the recent category. Name some good dunk contest outside of Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in the last like 10 years. You can’t because the dunk contest has been absolute garbage because no name or fringe all star players compete in it. The dunk contest has been trash for years it became a joke when the jazz’s 13th man off the bench won it."
Harris had enough impact to turn our series around and shut down Clarkson and game 7 Mitchell. Aaron Gordon can't do that.
Forever the dunk contest outside of like 2 instances has been shit for years. We really forgetting Jeremy Evans winning the dunk contest. Outside of Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine the entire thing has been pretty much trash. You can tell your like 20 years old because the dunk contest has been trash for years.
My best friend is a Detroit fan but he went to the same high school as Aaron Gordon. He believes AG has the potential to be an All-Star now that he's on the Nuggets.
"Lol like 2 games of Aaron Gordon with the Nuggets and we’re gonna crown them 2nd in the west? They’re in a tier with Clips, Jazz and suns behind the lakers. All of those teams can beat one another"
"I know it’s been said a lot but Aaron Gordon really is a great fit on this Denver team. In his post game interview he praised Jokic and his passing ability, and said “he’s got eyes on the back of his head.” They connected on some great passes last night with AG cutting to the basket. They’ve got good chemistry already and the more they play together the more crazy passes we’re going to see them connect on. His defense significantly elevates the Nuggets too. He guarded both Kawhi and PG and did a great job. He also had 3 steals/2 blocks.  MPJ continues to impress. I remember last year during the playoffs, people were saying he’s a black hole on defense. I think he’s playing great defense this year. Using his height and being more aggressive.  Last thing I wanna point out... the Nuggets shot 52% from 3. Their overall FG% was 48.1."
"LMAO you guys get pissy over the stupidest shit, Aaron Gordon and Wade have literally buried the hatchet and had several talks since the dunk contest, y’all more hurt then Gordon is."
Luke ate 50 eggs. Aaron Gordon = #50. Coincidence??? 🤔
"DJ Jr had much smoother dunks than Aaron Gordon, the right man won"
What do you mean? Aaron Gordon won both of those contests. You must have it mixed.
"Aaron Gordon is so much better than Grant on defense it’s mind boggling. I’ve watched the Nuggets 4 straight years. They have never been remotely this good on defense. Also, MPJ and Jokic are much better than they were last year."
Kawhi abused Aaron Gordon in the first round of the playoffs when he was with Toronto. Maybe Kawhi sees significant improvement.
"Some dude was claiming yesterday that Aaron Gordon was robbed in the 2016 dunk contest because at some point, the commentators (Kenny Smith specifically IIRC) had said that 'it was over' after an AG dunk.    Like... IMO it was close enough that it could've gone either way, and I can definitely understand how some people thought AG was robbed, but pointing to a commentary team that is, at this point, notorious for overhyping dunk contests is just peak ridiculous."
aaron gordon GOAT
Y'all can complain about dunk contest he clearly lost forever for all I care what's really egregious here Aaron Gordon rubbing his nipples on TV for 3 minutes straight
"Takes off that Korver mask.... ""Oh look, it's Aaron Gordon!"""
"Forgot who I heard put it this way but they traded their best defender, Gary Harris, for their new best defender, Aaron Gordon. They’re not all of a sudden going to be a great defense."
I’ve never really watched Aaron Gordon until tonight and is it just me or it his shot ugly af? Like really really bad?
"What a loser Aaron Gordon is for putting a lot of effort into competing in the dunk contest and putting on a show for the fans lol  Also the reaction after every bad dunk contest: This is so trash, these players didn’t put any creativity in this. Not entertaining."
I love how Aaron Gordon has become the bad guy when he got fucked over arguably twice but at least once in the dunk contest
Aaron Gordon cares alot about his dunk contests
"I'm just happy to see Aaron Gordon having success with his new team, after being eluded by playoff success and dunk contest wins for years."
Aaron Gordon fits on this team perfectly
Aaron Gordon is a game changer for the Nuggets
Aaron Gordon got damn
3-0 in the Aaron Gordon era!
Is Aaron Gordon Scottie Pippen with a bigger dick?
Aaron fucking Gordon
Is Aaron Gordon the defensive player of the year?
Wtf has aaron gordon always been this good?
Aaron Gordon is a top 10 most beautiful man in the current NBA. You can't change my mind
"He's just very hot or cold, nickname is the human torch and all. Can learn to live with those types of shots because he tends to only take a bunch when he's making them left and right. Otherwise he tends to ride the bench most of the game so need to worry about it.  And i agree 100% about Okeke, already refreshing sometimes to watch him instead of Aaron Gordon, just better IQ"
Aaron Gordon was the best deadline deal. I can’t believe they got him. Such a great fit for the nuggets. They are going to be tough to beat. Damn.
"The reason people underrate Denver is because they don’t see Jokic as what he really is: the 2nd best player in the league, and the best player this season. Come on guys, his PER is around 34, no one else’s PER in NBA history has been above 32. He impacts the game so much and commands so much attention that the nuggets starting 5 is basically unguardable now that MPJ has developed and Aaron Gordon is here. Too many weapons"
"People have underrated the Nuggets so ridiculously all season long even after making the conference finals last year and being a couple of minutes away from the conference finals in 2019. Now Aaron Gordon is here, who’s a better player and fit than Jeremi grant. When will people understand?"
"I must admit, Aaron Gordon is so much better than Grant on every aspect of the game. I never thought we would be able to replace Grant with even better version of him. Maybe Grant is a better shooter but Gordon does everything else better"
"Aaron Gordon is a bonafide Kawhi stopper. Yeah, Denver in 5 over the Clips."
Aaron Gordon is perfect for the nuggets leygo
Man the more I think about it the more I like the Aaron Gordon trade for Denver. I think that’s a really good situation for him.
I know I’m supposed to not like Denver because of our “rivalry” but this team is just so damn likable. Especially with the Aaron Gordon and campazzo additions I’m pretty sure it’s impossible to dislike Denver lmao
Was Aaron Gordon the sneaky best trade of the season?
All this to beat aaron gordon smfh
Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball. Both are decent but neither is a star at this point. Give AG Lonzo’s point guard skills and 3pt shooting and you have an all-nba player
"Come to the nuggets bro, comeback kids, Underdogs, getting better every year, generational talent in jokic and MPJ, showtime glue guy in Aaron gordon and the Guin as emotional leader.  Bol!!!"
"First of all, the Nuggets' current win record is closer to a 51-win pace than 50 wins. Also efficiency is a thing, as is strength of schedule (the Nuggets' remaining schedule is easier, they've been on a hot streak, and Aaron Gordon should help them win more than they did early in the season.)"
"Before this year, blazers fans begging to trade CJ for like aaron gordon was hilarious. CJ plays about as good as Dame in the playoffs"
pretty sure aaron gordon and javale have done this
I've literally seen Aaron Gordon do this
Aaron Gordon
I'm sorry but MPJ will never be the high flying muscular specimen that is Aaron Gordon.
"&gt; i love how you assume that just because doc rivers played a morris/harrell frontcourt vs jokic, that the lakers would be doing the same.  Harrell is their 3rd best offensive player and the only positive offensive player on the team by most metrics other than LeBron and AD, they need his scoring, the problem is it comes with a tradeoff because of his defense.   &gt; and nuggets also lost their best lebron defender  Just got Aaron Gordon for exactly that purpose"
Imagine thinking Aaron gordon is going to push you over the top
I like our trade a lot and honestly more than anything just glad to see the front office make moves to get better and go after all star caliber players to compliment our all star.       Aaron Gordon is great for Denver though.  He’s a perfect fit for them compared to anyone else available so kudos to them
"Two reasons. First, the draft really is less predictable than you think and even if you try to simplify things and go ""let's throw upside out the window and just go after someone who's ready to contribute from day one"" you're not going to identify those players with 100 percent accuracy; Malachi Flynn and Grant Riller also had a lot of people talking up how NBA-ready they were going to be.  Secondly, being able to help in the postseason when rotations are tighter and everyone's read the scouting report on you is a higher bar and contending teams can make better use of their prospects/picks than just acquiring a competent enough bench guy. Let's pretend Bane was drafted #15 or wherever you think he deserved to go: would it be better for a team like the Nuggets to have used #24 and a future 1st to move up and get Bane, or to get Aaron Gordon at the trade deadline?"
Idk why but Aaron Gordon on the nuggets just sounds rignt
"I was watching the Nuggets v. Sixers game live. MPJ was on fire in the first quarter. Looked pretty solid for most the game too. I'm really enjoying the Nuggets Roster this year, especially with the addition of Aaron Gordon."
"Aaron Gordon might not put up the same stats, but I doubt he's gonna mind. Frankly the fit is perfect and he wasn't contending on Orlando to begin with."
"If Aaron Gordon and Aaron Judge enter the same room do they become a singularity?  Both 6'8"", similar build, (similar face)[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9Rjd91UQAAcJ28?format=jpg&amp;name=small], elite athletes."
"We literally got Aaron Gordon to address this issue and Mike Malone had a press conference two days ago where he talked about lack of ability to defend big wings as the reason for getting him (specifically describing Craig's and Grant's departure), yet for some reason you think you know better.  If you can't tell the difference between Grant / Craig and Dozier build, get new glasses."
Where did this myth that Cliff hates young players come from.  He like any coach plays anybody as long as they are good.  The fact that Bamba who sucks has had so many chances is counterintuitive to this idea that he doesn’t let guys play from the jump.  Chuma has gotten minutes from the beginning of the season even if you can argue he didn’t earn it because Cliff saw something from the start.  The fact is he was never gonna start over Aaron Gordon who is a proven player and he really didn’t want. Chuma playing tne3 because he is a natural PF.  If he is on the bench next year it’s not gonna be because he sucks or that Cliff hates him it’s gonna be because Cliff doesn’t want to start him and Isaac together because they both play the same position.
Aaron gordon and MPJ are a more alike than blake and gordon.
I thought it was Aaron Gordon
How did Denver pull off getting Aaron Gordon for nothing...
Damn getting Aaron Gordon was a genius move by Denver
Aaron Gordon sucks
He didn't put Aaron Gordon back in  Guess he felt the bench guys literally couldn't run functional offense against your garbage squad without Jokic / Murray / MPJ to prop them up.
"Oh yeah, that was a dominant win by the Nuggets. The margin doesn't tell the story. If the Nuggets were worried about margins, Barton and Campazzo wouldn't have gotten all those minutes and Aaron Gordon would have played more. They took their foot off the gas when the game was in hand. I don't personally feel a team should ever do that, but whatever."
Aaron Gordon has now closed out on Simmons twice this season when he was about to shoot a 3 lol.
"this is a situation where adding a player actually means more than the player itself, Aaron Gordon is a big good athletic player. hes not more than that but it just by default helps the team defense and offense so much just by existing  when you have unathletic bums (like we do) that are 6 foot 5 or shorter sit on the perimeter and then shoot average at best from 3, then be a liability in defense because they are unathletic and undersized they can't keep up with speed or block or make shots difficult, your team looks worse."
"Aaron Gordon not getting calls, welcome to Denver."
Its like the trade supermotivated the nUggets..brought them all together. Aaron Gordon was so happy to about it. nUggets right now are playing better than they ever have I think. Even better than the playoffs last year. I hope they can continue.
Hot take: Aaron Gordon was a good acquisition by the Nuggets
Damn!!!! Everybody having a fucking blast out there Aaron Gordon
Nuggets just have so many weapons now..Porter has blossomed Aaron Gordon has joined the team. Murray has gone back to bubble Murry. Jokic what can you say..
Aaron Gordon and Aaron judge
What an amazing trade. Got Aaron Gordon and dumped a bad contract for 2 late firsts essentially.
Aaron Gordon looks so happy.
"I love your guys' entire team with one glaring exception... MPJ. And Aaron Gordon can miss me, but that's just my bias as a Raptor fan and he has (legit from his perspective) beef with Kyle."

"Denver Nuggets. Their 3 tall players ( Aaron Gordon, Michael Porter &amp; Nikola Jokic ) are all handsome guys."
"It will still be Lakers in 5, Jerami Grant is better than Aaron Gordon."
"just tuned in, thought Aaron Gordon was wearing buttas for a sec lmao"
"And, Jokic has the spacing of Austin, Facu, Harrison, Aaron Gordon and PJ Dozier and is still winning games."
"You are also playing a pretty tough team tonight, don't forget what we did to your team last time we played eachother. It's very clear Raps are the best team in the league. Aaron Gordon will also get ejected early on tonight since he is playing vs. Lowry."
"Everytime I look at the Nuggets box score, I see Aaron Gordon with like 8 attempted shots in average. What's going on with him?"
On an eFG 10% higher 🤦🏻‍♂️ Aaron Gordon matches Oubre’s scoring on an eFG 8% higher. And before Murray went down he was averaging 21 😂 I could go on. How much help does Jokic need?
AG like Aaron Gordon? He's definitely played in the playoffs before..
"&gt;But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys.  ?? Yes it does, this whole conversation is about how you are worse after losing those guys. Other teams have been able to replace guys who leave easier.  I don't blame you for trading for Kemba - at least that was an attempt to replace Kyrie, but you didn't replace Hayward, Horford, Morris, or Rozier with good enough players.  Contenders are able to find value in the bargain bin every year, don't give me the whole ""woe is me"" bullshit as if you didn't have options available. Covington was traded for a mid-round first. Horford himself was dumped for nothing. You could have moved Hayward last year before he jet set on you. Dwight Howard is a backup C on a contender, Torrey Craig is a rotation player for a contender, You didn't want to move for Aaron Gordon last year when you had 3 1st round picks for up grabs. Jordan Clarkson went to the Jazz for nothing. George Hill, Delon Wright basically moved for nothing but you went for shitty ass Jeff Teague instead.  Please don't act like there was no alternative. Ainge made some wrong moves in trusting goes, drafted the wrong people, etc and these are the consequences."
"I think we just differ on how we define “good defenders”. For me, good defenders are the guys who take the tough matchups. If MPJ is assigned to defend a guy who can’t do anything off the dribble, sure I think he could be really solid in that role. But if he gets switched onto Steph or Dame or Luka, you feel like he’s going to be able to defend those guys well? Do you think he can be an Aaron Gordon level defender? Highly switchable?"
How about the conflict of interest at the dunk contest when he gave Aaron Gordon a 9 so his boy on the heat could win the round
"Neither MPJ nor Jamal are the liability they once were. MPJ is clearly getting better at it as the season progresses. He might get blown by, but he might just end up getting a chasedown block these days. Aaron Gordon can lock down and block. Facu can easily piss off whoever he is defending (and their fans) and hold someone like curry to 25% shooting with 5 turnovers. Jokic is actually good at defense using advanced metrics, even if he isn't the best rim protector. He is one of the league leaders in steals and is great at interrupting passing lanes. McGee can be our rim protector if we need that. Dozier is solid. Shaquille Harrison has been clamping down and getting a good amount of steals and deflections in his short time on the team."
"You're forgetting Aaron Gordon, (should've been) 2x NBA dunk champ, just flying around"
Honestly the dunk contest isn’t the same without Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine
Week 17 stats.  Jamal Murray | Will Barton | Michael Porter Jr. | Aaron Gordon | Nikola Jokic  Stats: 133.9 offensive rating | 100.0 defensive rating | +33.9 net rating | 90 minutes played  That was what could have been.  Get well Murray.
If you've got something like:  Luka / Beal / Mikal Bridges / Aaron Gordon / Capela  you're certainly a contender.
Aaron Gordon Lol
"Speaking objectively, there was the Aaron Gordon incident but also that arm bar on Paul George during the 1st round of the 2016 playoffs (wasn't a great look for Kyle)"
"The Grizzlies were keeping up pretty well but just looked like they got so tired in the second half. I don’t blame them — last night was the last game of a 7 game/11 day road trip for them. When these two teams played each other at the beginning of the Grizzlies road trip the game was much closer, going into double overtime with Denver winning by 2 points. Ja Morant has some amazing moves for finishing at the rim. Brandon Clarke looked good on defense.  The obvious things to point out about the Nuggets are how amazing Jokic is, and MPJ’s awakening. Mpj scored 31 last night after getting a new career high 39 points in their last game vs the Rockets. Last night Paul Millsap was the man. Looking at the box score he’s only credited for one steal but he definitely had a hand in at least one other one. He was also hitting some pretty clutch shots. Jokic had a full court pass to Austin Rivers for an easy two points. Aaron Gordon has been a revelation. He’s thriving on this team.   MPJ’s younger brother Jontay is on the Grizzlies. He got put in at the very end for the last 4 or 5min. But J Porter was fouled on a 3pt shot and made all 3 freethrows. MPJ was smiling at him from the bench. It was a sweet moment.  Next play Bol Bol got fouled. Made both his freethrows. The crowd was chanting MVP, lol. He also had a crazy dunk to end the game. His teammates and the crowd were loving it."
"Well, yeah lol that’s why the title of the post is “what held Aaron Gordon back from becoming a star”"
I see Aaron Gordon as Josh Smith lite.
Aaron Gordon ain’t part of no big 3 and that team would get slapped by the Lakers
You're a moron if you couldn't understand that comment.   Denver didn't have Will Barton in the playoffs last year either. Jokic was already the best player in the series and he's even better this year. Denver basically added MPJ as a player since he wasn't good last year and also Will Barton and Aaron Gordon.
"Aaron Gordon, Blake Griffin, Drummond, list goes on of guys who didn’t pull this shit on bad teams"
"That'd be my ranking *if* they were fully healthy. I don't think people realize how well they've been playing recently, particularly MPJ. And Aaron Gordon has fit in really well."
No Jamal Murray or Gary Harris makes things a lot easier for the Jazz though. Aaron Gordon simply doesn't exploit our weaknesses like those two do.
Aaron Gordon = Aar Jordon
Aaron Gordon lol
"Malone’s biggest weakness is his rotations IMO. Other than that, I think he’s a pretty good coach. Yeah, maybe he gets bailed out a bit by his star players, but every coach does. NBA is a star driven league.  Strengths:  -	Culture/chemistry/locker room. Not sure exactly what you want to call this, but he’s absolutely been great at getting guys to buy in to the culture. After the shaw debacle and our culture was in the toilet, he rebuilt it. Jokic was a big part of that, but you also have to think about the fact that there’s plenty of orgs where Jokic could have gone and never achieved the greatness he has now. The culture and locker room are part of that. Same thing with MPJ. -	player development. This kind of ties into the above, but we have had a seriously great run of young guys coming in. A big part of that is Connelly drafting well, but you have to give Malone credit for his staff developing those guys into players as well   Weaknesses:  -	Rotations. I think that all of us routinely want to pull our hair out at some of his rotation decisions. Especially when he falls in love with a defensive hustle guy (like facu or craig) and arguably plays them way too often and in lineups that don’t make sense. I think there’s also an aspect of line up identity - more so with the bench than the starters - that sometimes gets lost. What roles is each guy playing? What is that lineup trying to do? I think Malone doesn’t look at it from the perspective of “okay this bench unit is going to have the 1/5 pnr as its bread and butter with XYZ as secondary options out of ABC sets” etc. I think for him he views everything through the lens of effort and defense. Even if it means playing a 4 guard lineup with PJ dozier at PF and Millsap at C. All that said, he is a pretty successful NBA coach, so it’s possible he knows more than we do here - and part of these baffling rotations might actually tie in to his management style that helps with the first bullet point under strengths to build a good locker room chemistry.  Middling:  -	X’s and O’s. I put this here because I don’t think it’s explicitly a weakness, but I also don’t think it’s a huge strength like it is for some of the other coaches in the league. And that’s OK, since different coaches have different styles. Especially when you have a savant like Jokic who just needs a loose framework in place to build off of and he does the minutiae himself. I do think part of the reason this isn’t a strength is tied back into the rotation thing. A coach who is strong at X’s and O’s is likely going to extend that same strategic thinking to the overall lineups and rotations. Guys are in for a reason because they are cogs in the machines and the sets. They have a role and a purpose. That’s not to say that’s totally absent with Malone, but again I think he views everything through effort and defense first and foremost. His overall philosophy is if you have those ingredients first and foremost, everything else will work itself out. You can overcome lineup deficiencies through that effort. I don’t necessarily agree, because I think there’s sometimes where you’re just simply outmatched on the chess board, but given that this is lost lot gripes about bench units, it doesn’t matter as much. Starters being matched up on the chess board is much more about the GM constructing the roster (ie getting Jerami grant and Aaron Gordon to match up with lebron/kawhi). Assuming the GM and coach are on the same page, anyway. Not always the case with guys like Javale McGee not getting minutes, but again that’s more of a bench thing."
"Once LaVine comes back full strength, we need to have this conversation again. Can’t rule out Vucević just yet.   Aaron Gordon and Rondo. Obviously ROSE. Knicks are winning a lot"
How many buzzer beaters has Aaron Gordon hit since being traded?
Aaron Gordon and Rondo/Lou Will (both sides won so far)
Aaron Gordon to the Nuggets.
"Have to mention Aaron Gordon to the Nuggets.  As a whole, the Magic did very well; finally decided to have a proper blow-up and they got solid returns for their 3 guys."
Aaron Gordon to Nuggets was the best trade
There are probably bench players who are better than Aaron Gordon at defense but they can't fully maximise their strengths because they suck at everything other than defense.
"Probably the Aaron Gordon package and another first? He's still got 2 years left on his deal and he's a nice 3&amp;d player.  &amp;#x200B;  Usually see him in trade rumors for young player + 2 firsts and I think that's fair. Also, if they want to create space for Holmes, wouldn't it make more sense to move Buddy instead?"
"sometimes it can be good developmentally to put undersized or tweener 4's at the 3 for a season, it forces them to learn more wing skills, which gives them an advantage when they slide back into their best role. i remember orlando fans being confused about why aaron gordon played the 3 for a season, but afterwards they kept saying it greatly improved his ball handling and shot creation."
"If player has a talent he will develop everywhere. What players Wolves failed to develop? Wiggins? He was given all the opportunities here, and he is not better in GS now. Culver? He is a bust. Towns ended up being a bad player? I don’t think so. Edwards and McDaniels have shown huge progress this season. Naz Reid is a completely different player after 2 years, and he was undrafted.  Another question - who did Detroit, Magic, Cavs or Rockets really developed over last years? May be Hezonja? Mo Bamba? Aaron Gordon was expected to be a better player, though he is very good. Even Oladipo was not that great there, he became all star in Indiana later. Detroit were consistently selecting mediocre players in lottery - Stanley Johnson, KCP, others. Who they did actually develop so you can say - WOW, this player is really great? Rockets did not have high picks for a while. Cavs got couple in a row and their young players look good, though not good enough (may be yet) to say that the development matters.   You are just biased because Boston really nailed down their top picks with Tatum and Brown as well as their development and roles. However, there is nothing wrong with being drafted by Timberwolves. In addition, our new GM hired a lot of development coaches and all of recent rookies have shown a progress besides Culver."
Aaron Gordon plays SF for us
"Here is what a PF looks like in 2021: Anunoby, Tatum, Maxi Kleiber, Aaron Gordon, Kevin Durant.   We're not talking Otis Thorpe here. Simmons (6'10"") is clearly better equipped to chase these guys around."
"Blake has a crazy good handle for a power forward and showed that from a very young age, so that’s probably setting unrealistic expectations.  A solid handle like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon could be possible tho"
Nugs also added Aaron gordon
"Aaron Gordon brought some of that Magic luck with him, huh?"
Wasn't defense why the Nuggets went after Aaron Gordon? How'd he do on Steph?
Aaron Gordon is gonna stab Denver in the back
"Imagine how they feel! Especially Aaron Gordon, that swing must be gutwrenching for him. Had the prefect situation for the first time in his career and then poof forced to take shitty ISO possessions again"
"Jokic has a trash ass roster? Huh?   Even without Murray (who still played 50 games) they have MPJ who's putting up a super efficient 18 ppg and gets daily KD comparisons, Aaron Gordon who I've been told many times is a perfect fit on the Nuggets and good to great roleplayers like Millsap, Green, Morris, Dozier, Barton and Facu."
Uhh Murray got injured fairly recently and Barton LITERALLY just got hurt this game. Aaron Gordon is without a doubt a solid starter and you’re not changing that. You can make a case for jokic being MVP without being disingenuous.
"He has definitely been carrying the team since Murray’s out  Barton: 12 points on 53 TS this season  Aaron gordon: 12 pt on 55 TS since the trade  MPJ has been good averaging 20-10reb on 65 TS but that’s about it  Subpar defense, no playmaking. The only reason we didn’t immediately fall in the standings was largely Jokic and MPJ being a good enough shooter."
"Not only that, but using the record as a metric forgets the impact of Aaron Gordon."
"Aaron Gordon went from the best pickup of the trade deadline to not a “starting caliber player” real quick then. Barton literally just got injured, you’re making it sound like Jokic has gone the whole season without him or Murray."
"Why is Aaron Gordon shooting 3’s, that’s not what he’s supposed to do in Denver’s offense"
"Curry inspired celebration, so inspiration   Also did Aaron Gordon throw the towel at him?"
Aaron Gordon looks like Malibu's Most Wanted.
"I can't wait, man. Reminds me of Aaron Gordon with maybe just as much potential."
welcome to the aaron gordon experience!
"There was no part of that play where Aaron Gordon had any advantage, but he just kept going lol."
Barton and Morris are two of the most underrated guards in the league. Aaron Gordon fits them perfectly (as did Gary Harris before him). Bucks are solid but it’s not like they’re the Nets. I prefer Jrue over Murray but they’re 100% comparable (sucks Murray got hurt only recently). Middleton is underrated but he’s more of a third option kind of guy.
Thank goodness Aaron Gordon got out of that basketball purgatory that is Orlando. I got so tired of Magic fans trashing him because they didn’t know how to use him. Killing it in Denver.
Thank goodness I don't have to irrationally defend Aaron Gordon anymore as the best dunker.
"Have you forgotten about Wiggins? Steph, Dray, Wiggins, Oubre, then Baze. That top 3 is honestly pretty solid, and Oubre has had some awesome games this year. He's a fine role player.   Assuming MPJ is the second best, who is the Nuggets 3rd best player right now? Aaron Gordon who is a very solid player, similar to Wiggins, maybe? After that though? It's a pretty fucking steep drop off. Like, Will Barton is good but not any better or worse than Oubre or Bazemore. They just bring different skills. He's a worse defender but he can handle the ball and pass a bit. Monte Morris is good, but again, just a role player like those dudes. The rosters are not as different as you make out without Jamal Murray."
Does Kyle Lowry have a single enemy outside of Aaron Gordon?
"Not necessarily. Even though you could pair together two top flight facilitators (lebron, Jokic, Luka, harden etc) there would still be some friction/tension because those players are both best with the ball in their hands.  Similarly, you *could* put AD and Giannis on the same team as hyper athletic guys who are defensive monsters and can finish at the rim with a variety of other accompanying skills and they would do just fine.  But the ideal marriage is one guy from column A and one guy from column B because their strengths and weaknesses mesh well together. Lebron can create offense for AD better than AD can for himself. And while lebron is a fine finisher on his own shots, having a lob threat like AD puts a lot of pressure on the defense and opens things up elsewhere.  Aaron Gordon isn’t even close to being on the same tier as those guys, but you can kind of see why we made the deal to get him when you saw how impactful he was playing off the jokic/Murray two man game on offense as a rim runner and cutter and then on defense he just takes whoever the biggest threat is.  Team construction is more important than people give it credit for IMO. Lebron and wade, for example, was never a perfect fit in my mind. They made it work because they were both two of the best in the league. But AD - despite being a worse player than Wade - fits much better next to lebron IMO. Same thing with kyrie."
"I just hope nurk can get in better shape in time for the playoffs, he looked so good in the 1st but he was just gassed vs jokic at the end. Gg tho nuggets. y'all are scary with aaron gordon and mpj. Sucks about murray tho"
"you do know lakers lost dwight green rondo mcgee right lol.  you got schroeder drummond and harrell, all suck in the playoffs or have no experience.  clippers got significantly better. nuggets got better with aaron gordon and will barton back  stop comparing previous seasons to current one you clown casual fan lmao"
*Undefeated with Aaron Gordon cornrows - FTFY
"Aaron Gordon to nuggets was an all round great move by all parties. Special bias mention to ariza for us, been awesome so far"
"Boys boys, he’s in a committed polyamorous relationship with Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter Jr called the Triforce  Edit - Changed polygamous to polyamorous, because their love for each other stays between them"
Aaron Gordon or maybe Evan Fournier if he didn't get covid
Maybe 6 games because healthy Nuggets + improved MPJ and Aaron Gordon is a slight improvement from last year’s team
Aaron Gordon is the perfect fit for Denver especially after losing Jerami
Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon to the Nuggets. We are 11-2 since the trade and 26-18 before.
"LOL  Removing the protections in spots like this usually costs a SRP or something  We were ALSO after Aaron Gordon, which is probably the real reason we said no"
"We have a big chance of falling out, considering our schedule. Even then, I think Neil tried to get you guys to remove the protections so we could probably send a pick for Aaron Gordon. And I’m guessing y’all said “Fuck you” and didn’t remove the protections. So I will kindly say fuck you and have a nice day"
Didn't the nuggets win 8 straight when Aaron Gordon joined the team?
Just being honest. Nobody is scared of Aaron Gordon and MPJ.
"Wow, Aaron Gordon. I’m so scared"
Is Aaron Gordon not good?
Current Aaron Gordon
Simmons would basically be a better version of Aaron Gordon who is fitting quite well in the nuggets system.
Aaron Gordon
They were without their 2 best defenders Johnathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon
"These are the teams he ""Dominated""  \- Pistons without Blake Griffin   \- Magic without Johnathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon  \- Kyrie celtics with a unhealthy hayward"
Can someone explain to me what’s going on with Aaron Gordon? PJ Dozier was getting minutes over him last night.
"He's already like a billion times better than MC fuckin W lol,  and injuries are a risk for absolutely every player. Joel Embiid got maxed. Simmons got maxed.   Who else replaces 22/10 on elite of the elite efficiency with room to improve?  And go scope some Aaron Gordon to nuggets threads, it gets talked about a ton"
Is Aaron Gordon banished to the shadow realm?
"&gt; Jamal Murray (24)  &gt;Aaron Gordon (25)  &gt;Jokic (26)  Those guys are all making ~30m/year. That's not a young core, that's who you have to win with now."
"Jamal Murray (24)  Monte Morris (25)  MPJ (22)  Aaron Gordon (25)  Jokic (26)  Am I missing something? Would you mind explaining to me your logic on how we're 18th and the Spurs, Cavs, and Knicks are higher than us?"
Aaron “Mr. 50” Gordon
If Aaron Gordon is your key you are not going far.   Murray injury was devastating for the Nuggets
"I mean you're just wrong. I've watched every single minute of every single nuggets game, many more than once. The defender he was early in the year is NOT the same player you see now. The things you're saying don't happen anywhere near as often. As I said, there nights where he has dominated, never getting blown by or losing his man, while protecting the rim and disrupting passing lanes. I don't know that from box scores, I know that cause I watch every single game. I use data to back this up, and all available data is saying that since moving to power forward, he has been an average defender and the nuggets have been average defensively despite having no elite defenders pre Aaron Gordon"
"His saga in Phoenix lionized him and made him, in my opinion one of the most overrated players. People were acting like he just got let out from prison when all he was was an above replacement level starter stirring the pot. He was like Aaron Gordon the last few trade deadlines; the most important player to have ever put up 10 points at league average efficiency. Are they ever going to be the reason you win a playoff series you shouldn't have? No. Are fans of both, the team trading them and team trading for them going to act like they're the last piece to Exodia? Abso-fucking-lutely."
Why would you pay Aaron Gordon? Look how you’re using him. He’s not the player he was
Wait where is Aaron Gordon and Jokic
Aaron Gordon 🤢🤢🤢  Anti-Vaxx KD 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
"Aaron Gordon is so disappointing, he hasn't had a stand out game where he steps up despite the Nuggets being down several players. Looks like Jokic is going to have to play at an historic pace every game for Denver to compete."
“Aaron Gordon has unlocked our championship potential”
Aaron Gordon = 2021 Ira Newble
No Aaron Gordon
This has been my thought on Aaron Gordon for years. He is 6'9 and been in two dunk contests because he can leap to the moon.   However the kid can't get but 5 or 6 a game most of the time. He almost never has 10 or more.
That time is past. Should’ve tried to move CJ in the off season for somebody like Aaron Gordon and promote Gary Tent Jr to starting SG.
They really should've tried outbidding Denver for Aaron Gordon. The irony that he's tasked with guarding Dame now is kinda funny.
[Aaron Gordon and Facundo](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/027/174/veggie.jpg)
"I think Aaron Gordon would’ve been exactly what you needed, same with Jerami Grant. Maybe Danny Green is an option for next year, he’s still a good defender"
Aaron Gordon
Bro what? You hear about this Aaron Gordon trade??
We regret man... would have done the Aaron Gordon trade for sure
Fucking beautiful move by Aaron Gordon
I can’t take Aaron Gordon seriously with those corn rows
If Aaron Gordon was an actor he would be typecast as the bully’s older brother
Why do they not like Aaron Gordon? I don’t see what Serge did wrong either
"They currently dislike Aaron Gordon and it's got me kinda torn. Lol. Hell, almost any remaining Magic alumni in the playoffs gets hated on by Magic fans. Elfrid, Aaron, Dwight, Serge, Jeff Green etc. Magic fans got problems with all of them. Tobias is the only one safe."
"Aaron Gordon to Denver and Derrick Rose to NY are definitely the biggest hitters. I will say that getting Fournier for two seconds *could* be a steal, but only if we can resign him— it would've been a lot more of a win if he hadn't spent most of the season after we traded for him in COVID protocol (fuck this season)"
If Gary had left or we overpaid him we would have been criticized for that too. There was no other real winning trade once Aaron Gordon was off the table for us.
Aaron Gordon and Derrick for sure. I’d also add Daniel gafford to the list.
James Harden but that’s was more early season  Aaron Gordon was the biggest addition   DRose is huge for the Knicks too
Aaron Gordon couldn’t have been any more perfect of an addition to the Nuggets
Aaron Gordon but iirc rarely have any midseason trades actually worked out and resulted in that team improving substantially.
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
"Aaron Gordon sure single covered Dame and shut that down real quick  yeah Luka gave everyone that work. Pat Bev, Kawhi, PG, Morris, you name it  and nope. Luka has a higher eFG% than Dame but can't make FT's. so Luka getting tougher defenders and still more efficient at shot making"
"Kawhi really fucked up.  Clippers with Kawhi, SGA, Gallinari, and all their picks to make a different move would actually be a really good team.   Probably could have gotten Aaron Gordon at the deadline this year and had some cap room to sign a FA."
"Ok, so we beat the suns. Then we have to play the Nuggets who have the MVP, as well as MPJ who is a walking bucket, and Aaron Gordon who plays great defense. If they don't make it out the first round then we play the Blazers. Who are awful on Defense, but offensively have Dame, CJ and Powell, as well Melo who can give them 20, or Nurkic. Both teams will be very hard to beat at their best. If we beat one of them, then who knows who we play. Could be the Jazz who make 15 threes per game. Could be the Mavs who are giving the Clippers all sorts of problems. The Clippers could come back and make it to the WCF. The grizzlies could stun the Jazz.   The West is a Dog-fight and every team is hard whether they are a title contender or not."
About a year ago I suggested they trade him for maybe Aaron Gordon on the knicks sub and I got 25 downvotes and everyone said I was an idiot for thinking they could get someone as good as Gordon for randle
"They picked Noel, Embiid, and Jah in 3 straight drafts. Only one of those guys lived up to their potential. Imagine how much worse they’d be if they had drafted Aaron Gordon instead of Embiid just because they thought they didn’t need another centre  Wiseman could very easily be like Jah or Noel, and even if you’re talking “win now”, the team was better when Wiseman was injured. Green does not add much to a lineup that already has Steph, Klay, and Wiggins   As for Cleveland, Allen is what he is. He’s a good centre, but not an elite centre. There’s no way they’d pass on a good big man if they thought he was better than Green just because Allen is there"
"Campazzo doesn't space the floor well enough to fit with Aaron Gordon.  Jamal Murray's on- and off-ball gravity really unlock Gordon's offense. Murray and Gordon screening for each other off-ball was killer because Jamal's a physical screen-setter and a shooting threat, and Gordon is big and strong enough that you can't switch Jamal's guy onto him.  My tin-foil theory about Campazzo is that our FO reached out to him assuming that we would put Monte Morris in a Jrue Holiday trade (and re-sign Grant), and didn't want to go back on their word when the trade fell through. Because he'd have been a nasty bench guard to run alongside either Murray or Jrue."
"Aaron Gordon is better equipped to guard Lillard than like 99% of the 6'7+ guys in the league. Giannis can guard Butler like this because he can go under screens, as Butler can't shoot 3s. It would be a totally different story if he could, and that's why Giannis can't guard Curry, he would have to run around screens all game long."
"I think Giannis guarding Butler is the biggest difference. I've wondered why guys like Curry, Dame, Harden etc..  haven't had 6'7 - 6'9 athletic guys chasing them around for the last few years. We're seeing it now. The Nuggets put Aaron Gordon on Dame last night too. That was also effective."
Aaron Gordon hounded him for the second half
Ty Lue: Kawhi maybe you can be a bit more like Aaron Gordon
"Portland's defense is so bad that y'all might as well put out Shaq Harrison (when Aaron Gordon isn't on), otherwise Dame might score 30 at the half again as it's clear a P&amp;R with Campazzo and MPJ trying to contain Dame is totally hopeless. Shaq can also actually penetrate and get to the rim against this porous Portland defense and his inability to shoot shouldn't hurt that badly."
LOL Aaron Gordon was from g league? I knew you guys got him cheap
"for anyone else reading this chain, just to show you how disconnected this dude is from reality, he doesn't consider 2:43 left in a game to be ""2 mins"" lmfao  &gt;2:43		Vlatko Cancar enters the game for Michael Porter Jr.	104 - 125	 2:43		Markus Howard enters the game for Monte Morris	104 - 125	 2:43		Shaquille Harrison enters the game for Nikola Jokic	104 - 125	 2:43		Zeke Nnaji enters the game for Aaron Gordon	104 - 125"
"Fo real. We’re missing our starting PG and SG and backup SG, while integrating an international 30 year old rookie Facu Campazzo, former free agent Austin Rivers, and Aaron Gordon into the starting lineup and former free agent Shaq Harrison and rookie Markus Howard into the second unit in the goddamn playoffs! That’s ludicrous. But if we lose this series the narrative on this sub will be because Jokic is a defensive liability who will never win a title. Even though he’s literally played at an elite level in the playoffs his entire career thus far..."
"We adjusted and put Aaron Gordon on him, I think that's why he was reluctant to shoot in the 3rd"
I think we actually have Aaron Gordon guard Dame Lillard for the rest of the series
Kudos to Aaron Gordon for cooling Dame off. You could see his frustration continuing to build up in the second half
Aaron Gordon locked him up the second half
Full credit to Aaron Gordon  stopped the bleeding and more
"We put Aaron Gordon on him, and Shaq Harrison for a few minutes. Both players did not guard him game 1. They've been amazing on him. In Dames defence he's absolutely gassed, and has had no help."
Aaron Gordon did a great job and he got cold afterwards
Well Malone made an adjustment and put Aaron Gordon on dame.  Stotts had no answer for that adjustment.
"If Aaron Gordon gets hot behind the three point line, I don't think anyone in the league can stop him in that span."
If denver holds on to win this... Jokić is clearly our best player but Aaron Gordon might deserve the game ball. Dame was going nuclear and he managed to slow him down
He’s an 80 in 2k. I just looked it up on [Google](https://www.2kratings.com/aaron-gordon).
Aaron Gordon has been huge so far for this quarter
aaron gordon cute as hell ngl
Lillard nearly bringing Aaron Gordon to his knees only for Nurkic to brick the three might be the perfect metaphor for this game so far.
Traded to Orlando for Aaron Gordon
"Hurt a bunch, forgot how to shoot, thrown in the Aaron Gordon trade"
For Aaron Gordon.  I guess.  You'd think Greg Anthony would trash him for dipping out on his son's team.
Traded for Aaron Gordon
He’s on Orlando. In the Aaron Gordon trade  Also he got hurt a bunch and forgot how to shoot
Aaron Gordon overrated
"Aaron Gordon trade would’ve been so much helpful against any other team than us tbh. Losing Gary Harris combined with all your other injuries is brutal when it comes to guarding Dame, CJ, and Norm"
"The year after the next is 2022-23 right? It’s hard for me to say Denver because of their cap situation that year.   Aaron Gordon, Will Barton and most importantly MPJ’s contracts will expire after the 2021-22 season (the odds are however they extend MPJ’s contract before he hits free agency). Then you have Jokic eligible for a supermax extension that same offseason which is going to take up a lot of cap space as well. Thus their cap puts them at a really difficult spot that they’ll eventually have to let go of some of their key players, so it’s a bit hard for me to pick Denver."
"You should really consider trading him to us for Aaron Gordon, he just doesn't have it anymore"
Maybe because Aaron Gordon is just not that good of a shooter? Not surprised he played meh
They have Aaron Gordon. Isn't he supposed to be their defensive 3/4 guy?
"for someone who's said ""bye"" more than once you still seem to be hanging around an awful lot.  You acknowledge that my comment was a joke &amp; yet you are taking this awfully seriously, as if highlight threads on r/nba have been a bastion for civil &amp; enlightened discourse at any time in recent memory.  The point is that perhaps you should lighten up and feel free to scroll on at any time.  Despite trying to attack me for being a ""casual"" and for somehow stereotyping you based on your flair, you seem to be more than willing to do the same thing back to me.  It seems like really you have an axe to grind &amp; took offense to me not living &amp; dying with the Bucks, which is insanely weird.  Did you ever stop to think that my comment about cellar teams in the NBA was pointed more at the Kings/Bulls/Hawks years of Jabari's career?    Since you want r/nba to be a shining beacon of intelligent discourse, how do you feel the Nuggets did tonight against the Blazers?  Do you think Jokic will be able to score enough to punish the Blazers &amp; force them to double so he can pass &amp; really unlock what makes Denver dangerous?  Do you think that MPJ &amp; Aaron Gordon can create enough offense to make it easy on Jokic and draw enough attention to even up the series?  Does Denver have anyone that can help Jokic punish Portland's PnR defense and expose Kanter?  To me, isoing Jokic against big bodies like Nurkic &amp; Kanter may not work, getting those guys moving &amp; into rotation and hitting the smaller Portland guards with screens seems like a recipe for success.     At face value it seems like Facu &amp; Austin Rivers won't have nearly enough to offset what Dame &amp; CJ can do, but maybe if Will Barton comes back they'll have a better shot.  The real X-factors will likely be whether or not Monte Morris can be healthy enough to give the Nuggets anything and how long Portland can survive with Anfernee Simons on the floor.  How do you feel about his development in general?  Do you think he's worth extending this summer?"
Aaron Gordon only played 28 minutes plus I thought Facu was doing a decent job on Dame. Portland also had a lot of offensive rebounds and Nuggets had some dumb fouls
The Aaron Gordon trade is so interesting. You get him to specifically defend Kawhi and Luka and LeBron and he’s great at that. But you gave up Gary Harris and RJ not knowing you’d be playing the one team in the west that has no wings that need Gordon’s specialties but have 3 guards. Like if you could travel back in time knowing this series is happening and you don’t make the trade and you have Gary and RJ on Dame and CJ I think this series is actually a pretty easy win for the Nugs. But if they win and go against the Lakers you’d want Aaron Gordon so I don’t know. Just a weird thing.
"I was trying to think who would be a good Draymond type next to Dame. Anyone else come to mind? I remember people saying Aaron Gordon could be in that mold, but I'm not sure."
Literally the only really good defender in denver's lineup is aaron gordon
Correct he was traded in the Aaron Gordon deal - so technically *missing*
The reason Nuggets lost: Aaron Gordon. With 3 minutes to go he turned the ball over and Blazers brought it down the court to score a layup and Aaron Gordon fouling for the and1. 10 seconds later he trips over himself and lets the ball go out of bounds giving the ball to Blazers resulting a 3 pointer from Lillard. Aaron Gordon literally melted down and caused Blazers to go from a 4 point lead to ahead by 10.
"Just as expected, Aaron Gordon making the big shots for the Nuggets down the stretch"
Aaron Gordon is overrated
Aaron Gordon getting exposed on both ends of the court 🤢
Aaron Gordon sucks ass.
Aaron Gordon is useless in this series.  Really no one for him to guard.
Feels like Aaron Gordon is so much worse than he should be
disaster game from Aaron Gordon
"10/10 times you take Aaron Gordon, but man if this Dame stretch doesn't show how important a Gary Harris level defender is to the Nuggets"
When Aaron Gordon and Lebrons dad have a kid?
Blake griffin is the perfect comp to Aaron Gordon no? Obviously not present Blake
who thinks aaron gordon can become a much better player? it seems like he doesn't have great instincts or much of a shot. i hope he can get to that next level
Aaron Gordon feels non existent on this nuggets team
Aaron Gordon can’t play basketball. I feel like this is going to be a problem in this series.
Srupid Aaron Gordon has as much dunk contest wins as me
Do you think Aaron Gordon jumps higher in Denver because of the thin air.
"Denver is matched up so poorly against the blazers. They brought in aaron gordon to defend 3-5, i.e. to help defend lebron, kawhi, pg, because their fromtcourt was weak defensively. But blazers' offense comes primarily through their guards, lillard, mccollum, and powell. And denver's guard rotation just got ravaged by injury, so now you have literally just campazzo trying to guard two great offensive players. Even if he does decent on lillard, which is hard, they'll have no one to put on mccollum. And if you double lillard, which you probably will have to, it's gonna be rough. Powell and mccollum will make that hurt.  And the kicker is that the problem isn't mutual. Portland's biggest problem is lack of defense in the backcourt, and now denver has no offensive threats in their backcourt. And portland's best defenders? A power forward (covington) and a center (nurkic) while denver's offense will need to run almost entirely through jokic.  It's a testament to how good the nuggets are that the odds are still 50/50. The loss of murray and barton makes this matchup look so bad on paper. Aaron gordon becomes useless, campazzo is trying to guard three people, nurkic will do about as well as you can expect someone to do on jokic...it's tough."
"I thought the same thing! They should have traded for vooch and aaron Gordon Could’ve traded wiseman, min 1st, wiggins, oubre and extra picks"
They can trade Aaron Gordon to get a better defender
What is the logic here? Give curry mpj and Aaron Gordon and he's doing ok
You’re joking right? Draymond and wiggins &gt; mpjr and aaron gordon
"I feel like Aaron Gordon would have been amazing on this team with Ant, DLo, and Rubio"
"Aaron Gordon could be here as well, even after the trade and with two starters down he hasn't done shit for the nuggets"
"Aaron Gordon could be here as well, even after the trade and with two starters down he hasn't done shit for the nuggets"
"You really underestimating Aaron Gordon lol like he doesn't have the flashiest stats, but he is the best defender on the Nuggets with how he is able to guard players like Kawhi, Lebron, Giannis type of players."
"Was looking for the deep cuts  Luke kennard, Aaron gordon and Kendrick Nunn"
"MPJ has a higher ceiling but he's not as proven as Murray. And if MPJ does pan out and becomes a perennial all-star, I think they just keep them both and get rid of a role player like Aaron Gordon or Will Barton."
Pain. Our starting guards are broken and we play one of the best backcourts in the west at the very least they can't stop jokic and mpj and Aaron Gordon might surprise me with his defense
"Larry bird to Aaron Gordon interestingly enough are connected by only two franchises, BOS and ORL. 3 players who played for both franchises connect them - Greg Kite, Shaq, Jeff Green  It goes Bird/Kite (BOS), Kite/Shaq (ORL), Shaq/Green (BOS), Green/Gordon (ORL)"
need aaron gordon to catch a body this game
Aaron Gordon = Dollar store birdman.
You can count on Aaron Gordon and MPJ to sell out.
"As long as Aaron Gordon isn't a complete dud, Nuggets should be ok."
The issue really is having him on the floor at the same time as Aaron Gordon. He makes more sense with JaMychal Green
There is almost no bet in existence I could feel more comfortable making than betting that Aaron Gordon will in fact not be making the hall of fame.
"Aaron Gordon could make the Hall of Fame, and in his speech he would cry about not winning the dunk contest."
Aaron Gordon is trying to get people to call him “Mr. 50” lol cuz of his dunk contest scores without a win  He even made a YouTube documentary titled that lol
A healthy KP and a Aaron Gordon as the 4 would be a great frontcourt.
"Yeah, but is Joel Embiid more valuable on the Bulls than Zach Lavine plus X player (joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Aaron Gordon, Tim Hardaway) is on the Bulls"

That magic that Jokic has that we can’t quantify Aaron Gordon is lacking it
Akin to Denver losing Aaron Gordon for 3 weeks
How about you try to trade CJ for a forward before blowing it up. Hell Aaron Gordon might be available after his performance against the Suns
Aaron Gordon?
"And y’all had Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, and Monte Morris play some of their best games of the season. Aaron Gordon shooting 60% from 3 for the series will never happen in another stretch of 6 games in his career."
Because Aaron Gordon is an average player.
"Aaron Gordon is a good player, but like literally has never been projected as a superstar lol. There's like five in the league at any given time, so a lot of talented people will be left out. It's either a lack of skill or a slightly lighter work ethic, I'm sure dude puts in plenty of work, but when there are people already better than you putting in more, you aren't closing the gap. That's okay too, theres no shame in just being a good NBA player. Not everybody has that drive."
Aaron Gordon
"Most players never achieve superstardom.  Aaron Gordon has never even achieved stardom, let alone superstardom.  He's had some years where he was a decent player on bad teams. Now he's a bad player on a good team. The answer is simple; he's not that good."
"I agree with you but the defensive scheme was obviously, no switch. It’s not jokic’s job to contest that jumper, you could tell every time he sagged in the paint and Aaron Gordon or whoever tried to contest the pull up, but failed. I think the whole nuggets defensive scheme got cooked in the second half. If Malone says to jokic to stay in the paint and guard the roll, don’t you think that might be a reason why Ayton isn’t rolling as hard?"
Aaron Gordon is not a second option. In fact he is barely even a third option. People are expecting way way too much out of him.
Aaron Gordon listen to me when I say this. You... are trash.
"They’d stand a good chance if MPJ’s scoring was more consistent, the back seems to be really bothering him. And Aaron Gordon couldn’t score to save his life yesterday. Morris and Barton were the only other guys that could score last night save for MPJs garbage time shots. Even then, Denver kept clawing themselves back into striking distance. A healthy Murray might not mean that they beat Phoenix but it sure as hell makes this a 6/7 game series instead of what’s shaping up to be a sweep"
Aaron Gordon has also played like absolute buns. Him getting 20 a night changes the outcome of all 3 of these games
Aaron Gordon and his turnaround floaters and fadeaways against much smaller defenders... Just cringing watching it happen
"I missed the game due to working a night shift so I'm trying not to jump to conclusions based on the stat lines, but what the heck does Aaron Gordon do out there?"
"The Nuggets really traded Gary Harris, RJ Hampton, and a 1st round pick for Aaron Gordon."
"The Suns haven't just played well this series, they also match up incredibly well against the Nuggets defensively. Case in point with Deandre Ayton essentially shutting down Jokic. Jokic had 32 last night, but it took him 29 shots to get there. People were saying he needed help, but it's hard for the starters to get in rhythm when he's taking as many shots as the rest of them combined. (Aaron Gordon was a mess tho, dont get me wrong)"
"Oh for sure, 29 attempts to get 32 points is definitely inefficient. But look at what the other Nuggets starters did. Aaron Gordon provided no help, MPJ who was quoted as saying no Phoenix defender can guard him couldn't do much at all either. Overall Jokic really had no help, and the Suns exposed that."
"Aaron Gordon: ""Yeah wtf Joker, get your shit together"""
"Aaron Gordon had a reverse arc, went from failing at being the man to failing at fitting this system versus grant who was successful at fitting the system and (not really super but still) successful at being the guy."
can't stop thinking about the Aaron Gordon hype speech and how he followed it up with whatever that was
"Aaron Gordon was on his bullshit, so was MPJ until the 4th quarter. Also, how many middys were they gonna let CP3 hit before they changed anything? 🤦‍♂️  I am rooting for the Suns in this series but I don't wanna see Denver go down like *this*. Come on, make it a series"
Aaron Gordon
"They have a limit on their defense with Jokic.  He’s not quick enough nor does he have the athletic jumping ability to be a great rim protector.  You also can switch with him a so the only options is a flawed drop back scheme, trapping, or zone.  The thing is if he had a longer wing span even without the athletic ability with his smarts he could be a good rim protector with his timing.  What they need is a PF who can protect the rim and help Jokic but also recover on the perimeter.  Maybe even play Center in spot minutes to relieve Jokic on defensive possessions.  What they need is like Giannis or AD type of defender at the 4.  The problem is they have Aaron Gordon who has always been better on ball then in help."
Aaron Gordon is a major let down
He’s talking about Aaron Gordon.
I am just glad dubs didn't get in the Aaron Gordon trade scenario... Ufff.
Aaron Gordon really demanded a trade to go and stink it up in Denver
I’m old enough to reminder when people thought Aaron Gordon was gonna be a super star.
Does Aaron Gordon line up? Because him.
If you could you would be on the nba not bitching about Aaron Gordon of all players
"MPJ is a firecracker, but he fucks up A LOT on defense. The thing is, i know he has hustle, I see him tip balls in passing lanes and he rary gets backed down. Its when he has to check guards, thats the lapse. I think the nugs got to get ANOTHER PF, this time for defense. Oh wait, that was meant to be aaron Gordon, but he went like 0-7 during the game. Man wtf idk what you can feasibly add to this team cp3 is added to the suns from last year.... instant deep playoff run. I just don't know what they can do after this."
“Great pass from Austin rivers” as he airballs a three into jokics hands and “oh boy” when Aaron Gordon was 0-8 and tried a turnaround floater
aaron gordon
Aaron Gordon isnt good at basketball.
I'm going to put it like this. If jamal and Barton weren't i justed they would be starting both are great shot creators and Murray is a good distributor this means we can put way more pressure on offense and make them work harder as wright now we have zero isolation scoring. This means Aaron Gordon isnt our second option and can focus more on defensing like he did when we traded for him and due to us having more capable shooters he can do his cuts better as they don't have to pack the paint. I'm still counting Dozier as I juries but this means Morris can lead the bench unit he is quite good at that task and our bench doesn't look complete ass. We are also not playing Campazzo more than 10 minutes so he doesn't get smoked for his size and has more energy to be effective offensively. Because mpj isn't the second option and guarded as tight on defense he has no need to create for himself because he can't dribble and is probably shooting better. Or I'm wrong just saying
"I think Portland and Dame also had great shooting variance but, we got extremely lucky with G league level players shooting 40+ from 3 and Aaron Gordon shooting 60%."
"throw aaron gordon in there too. obviously didnt have much expectations, but man does he disappoint offensively. like so many others, he really needs to put all his fucking effort into some post moves/dribble moves and a decent fucking shot."
"Oh definitely but you can certainly cover a lot of his inadequacy up with good defensive schemes and rotations. They’re completely giving the midrange up because Jokic doesn’t have quick enough feet to recover if beaten off the dribble - basically selling out on stopping guards getting in the paint. Problem is Book &amp; CP are lethal midrange shooters. The open 3s given up however, is just complete lack of defensive communication by the entire Nuggets team. They look tired &amp; lethargic most times. I don’t even know why Aaron Gordon is on the floor 70% of the time"
"Imagine if Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter, Jr. made a few more shots each... 😣"
"Yes, definitely. If you think otherwise you're a Suns fan swingin at the air, or you don't watch basketball. Fuck, if Aaron Gordon and MPJ would just wake up I can see it going to 6-7 games STILL."
We tried to tell them with our couch analysis. Aaron Gordon just isn't a very good basketball player.
That's the vintage Orlando Magic Aaron Gordon right there.
Aaron Gordon looks like Beasley with those braids
"Aaron Gordon hasn’t been a factor in this series, that’s for sure"
MPJ and Aaron Gordon might legit be morons
Wtf happened to Aaron Gordon

Aaron Gordon trick yall
Aaron Gordon was a jerk in Uncle Drew
"Nuggets never stood a chance down jamal, starting facu and Austin Rivers, with injured will barton and Paul millsaps corpse off the bench. Oh an aaron gordon picked the perfect time to turn into ekpe udoh lol."
AAron Gordon hasn't done anything after calling his teammates out after game 1.
Aaron Gordon is literally just a light skin version of JyMychal Green. Get Jokic some help already
I think if Aaron gordon and micheal porter jr could hit their shots with a jamal murray to help with leadership and scoring would make this a legit 7 game series toss up.
Not sue how you can be a better defender than Aaron Gordon when he is able to clamp 2 teams at the same time.
"Imagine being Aaron Gordon, absolutely psyched to finally be in a situation where you're only asked to play to your strengths, then two weeks later that team loses their entire backcourt and it's back to the same shit you were doing in orlando"
Aaron Gordon really just an ass version of Chris “Birdman” Andersen huh
"lol holy fuck aaron gordon made a FG, games over"
Serious: is Javale McGee actually worse than Aaron Gordon?
"MPJ, Kyle Kuzma, Aaron Gordon"
"Aaron Gordon pickup is atrocious, 6 points 1 rebound last game and now 0 points this game"
Trade Aaron Gordon. He is a waste of space. Terrible trade by Denver
Aaron Gordon is fucking useless
God bless you Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon has the same amount of points as I do.

Aaron Gordon has been so bad for Denver
Gf says that Aaron Gordon looks like handsome Squidward
Aaron Gordon just getting cardio out there
Hope Jamal pans out as that missing piece. Also hope Aaron Gordon has a bit more time to find his rhythm with the team. Also Hopefully for nuggets fan MPJ can bring that next great scoring threat along with with good defense. So mainly they just need to develop what they have.  Because I got feel the have the right pieces to go all the way. They just weren’t all together this year.
"The kicker is that the Pelicans can throw in their 3 recent 1st rounders (NAW, Hayes, Lewis) and 1st rounders from themselves, Milwaukee and LA.    Meanwhile Denver just gave up Hampton and multiple 1sts for Aaron Gordon. They have less to offer (unless they add MPJ)."
You have almost all your picks and a good young player in MPJ. You also have Aaron Gordon/Jamychal Green/Will Barton (if he opts in) to match salaries and Monte Morris on a team friendly contract.   Although I would probably move Murray instead of MPJ because Lillard and Murray will be essentially playing the same role.
Aaron Gordon on D Wade
Aaron Gordon on Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry on Aaron Gordon
"I would trade Aaron Gordon for Ben Simmons., Nuggets needs a defender atm, maybe even MPJ."
"Well said. I just don't see how Simmons fits unless Simmons turns into Aaron Gordon, and that's not a $30 million a year player."
"The whole post is a reaction to a lot of fans I see here always saying ""what if"" and giving excuses for why their team is out of the playoffs as we speak, and the entire idea about championship teams having *asterisks beside their names just because of injuries to the opposing team.   The Championship should be awarded to the teams that react and prepare for any and all eventualities that may happen to your team during the course of the season. My point is that it's not totally on luck and that there are some teams that handle it better than others...case in point is Denver. After Jamal Murray went down, they strung together a 13-3 record leading into the playoffs and were playing their best basketball after the Aaron Gordon trade. In short, they controlled what they could control DESPITE injuries to their best guard.   I believe prevention is also a huge part of the equation and also planning JUST IN CASE injuries happen because they will at some point in time. If you can make your team play through injuries by having BETTER PLAYERS ,which is a function of an outstanding coaching and player development staff, then you are better equipped to handle injuries when they occur. The point is, the organizations that do their homework and preparation will have a better opportunity to control their own destiny and help their teams win despite all the bad luck that may happen along the way, which may include injuries to their best players."
"Because the nuggets had to play drop coverage due to their defensive limitations (which has more to do with injury than anything else).  If we are fully healthy, we are playing him at the level and switching basically everything 1-4. But given that we weren’t healthy enough to do that AND those same injuries also meant Jokic never got a single play off on the offensive end he was totally gassed. Which makes drop a little bit better from an economy of energy standpoint.  Playing him at the level typically requires our weak side big to rotate over as the rim protector - in this case it would be Aaron Gordon. But we had to put him on booker because our guards were facu campazzo and Austin rivers. So that kind of took that option away.  So we could keep running the hedge system and give up flushes to ayton (and tire Jokic out more) or play him in the drop and let CP3 shoot middies. Not great either way, but sometimes you have to pick your poison. But literally every big would get cooked on drop there. That’s kind of how drop works - you concede the midrange. Cp3 is just very good at the midrange. But it’s not like we had the guards who could fight through the screens that make life more difficult for him. And it’s unfair to Jokic to say “well he couldnt show on the screen AND tag ayton as the roller” because very few guys can do that. And none of them can do it consistently and contribute at the offensive end the way he did.  We gonna re-litigate the entire jazz series and the way they put them in a bind where Rudy couldn’t be in two places at once and exploited their defense? How about Trae feasting on embiid in the pnr?   News flash: offenses are good in this era. Defense is hard. The best thing you can ask is to be able to have a roster that allows you to do different things based on your scheme. The truly atrocious defensive players are the ones that can’t play in any scheme at all."
"I mean look, Murray like you said was a top lotto pick. Aaron Gordon was a top lotto pick, but because the magic did a horrible job/bad injury luck his value diminished because of the magic tanking again.   Jokic is the biggest draft exception of all time…and that’s widely noted. Again there are exceptions but this is not the norm"
I mean look at the nuggets? We’re any of those guys besides Murray drafted in the top 10?? I guess Aaron Gordon now. But when they made the conf finals it was a bunch of mid first and second round guys. Our last 3 mvps were picked after 15. It’s unlikely but you’re acting like it’s wayyy out of the realm of possibility
"Nope. The lottery and the NBA for that matter is a lot like life.  It’s not fair.   When we start creating rules to allow for equal outcome rather than equal opportunity, we are opening up a can of worms that we wouldn’t be able to come back from.   You want to complain about the system? How about complain about the front offices of the Kings and Magic that can’t build a winning team after many years of top 10 picks.   It’s not the Cavs/Raptors fault that the Kings drafted Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson with top 10 picks in the recent years.  It’s also not their fault that the Magic selected Mo Bamba, Mario Hezonja and a bunch of good but not great players for them like Jonathon Issac, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo all in the top 10."
"Look at from this perspective.  Hampton was a late 1st rounder on a team that has  constantly found gems late in the draft over the last few years.   They found this year's MVP in the 2nd Round of a Draft that the ""experts"" say was a top heavy class.  Their GM's 2 biggest draft night mistakes gave the Jazz their best 2 players &amp; made them into an contender.  When Orlando made the deal to send Aaron Gordon to Denver, it was not about Gary Harris (who's a FA after next year) or the 1st round pick that will likely be at in the 20-30 range, it was about Hampton. That guy is going to be a big part of the Magic's rebuild."
"Denver traded RJ Hampton 25 games into his rookie yearfor Aaron Gordon, and this is after people were shocked that he fell this far and that Denver got another steal in the draft. It happens.   The fact that Orlando wanted Hampton in exchange for an popular and established player like Gordon shows what the Magic thought of him too. They played him immediately and his numbers went way up. 11 PPG, 5 Rebounds with Orlando as opposed to 2 PPG in garbage time with Denver.  Getting traded it's not always a bad thing. While your team is getting rid of you, it's because somebody else wants you. It's not nearly the same as getting cut or demoted to G-League."
"Wtf I hope the Raptors take Kuminga so the Magic can get Suggs, they don’t need Aaron Gordon 2.0"
"&gt; multiple of those calls were weak as fuck too  They really weren't. He got two other double technicals (one where he and KCP both got T'd up for jawing at each other, and one where he and Aaron Gordon both got T'd up), but the other two were totally on him. [One was for being pissed that the Lakers were gonna win Game 3](https://youtu.be/yjVfRkoqOqU?t=241) of the 1st round after Booker got ejected for shoving Schroder in the air, and the other was for taunting at the end of Game 6. At the time I told a bunch of Suns fans that was stupid because those can add up, but they all said ""totally worth it."" That shit can come back to bite you in the ass though. Just ask Draymond Green."
"I felt like the Magic had a promising future with Aaron Gordon, Payton and Hezonja but they all sucked ass.  Honestly…   What can you do?"
I can't wait to pass on the next Devin Booker in this upcoming draft for the next Aaron Gordon.
"Yea no shit if we tried our hardest and played lowry 40 minutes a night we couldve gotten 30-odd wins. No fucking team thats not on the playoff picture would do that, are you delusional? Even with 30ish wins we aint making playins or even sniffing playoffs. If yall didnt trade away vuc and aaron gordon to tank u coulda done the same thing, pre obv yall mother fuckers were tanking too by getting rid of ur best players"
There’s also the chance he becomes Aaron Gordon and they return to the same purgatory they just traded out of at the deadline
Jamal Murray is really good. He was great in the bubble and then struggled early in the season so I know this subreddit was ripping on him. He's a similar player to Donovan Mitchell. Not always the most consistent player but when the lights are bright they play well and can carry a team.  MVP Jokic + playoff Murray would have been really fun to watch. Porter could have just done his thing as the third option and Aaron Gordon could have focused on his defense and energy more so. I know there were a ton of injuries for these playoffs but I feel this one was one of the biggest.
"I think there’s no blanket right answer for this. I think situation and context really matter. BPA I believe is a smart approach when your cupboard is bare and you’re searching for THE guy. But look at the Hawks. Once they got their guy in Trae Young, Atlanta drafted BPA at positions they needed to fill around Trae, and now they’re in the ECF way ahead of schedule. I think Orlando is a better example than Philly of BPA gone wrong, actually. Oladipo and Elfrid Payton in B2B drafts, taking Aaron Gordon while they’re investing in Tobias Harris, and then tanking another raw wing in Hezonjia in 2015, all while playing often through the slower, more methodical Vucevic down low. Channing Frye compared all those pieces to “rats climbing a ladder.”"
"The draft actually hurts smaller market teams because it handicaps their ability to grow organically and allows bigger markets to just tank and pick up the best prospects, since smaller markets can't tank without hurting themselves financially.  Look at the Pacers, without a draft we could have had the likes of Gordon Hayward, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, etc. come up, not to mention Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Shawn Kemp and other historical greats. Instead we have to try hard every year to be competitive and end up with Goga Bitadze, Aaron Holiday, TJ Leaf etc."
He might become an empty stats bad team guy. I was surprised how BAD Aaron Gordon and Fournier looked on their playoff bound teams
He’s a perimeter defender not a rim protector. Playing him as a big negates his defensive strengths and leaves a hole in the middle. His best position is probably the 3/4 like Aaron Gordon
"Well it’s kind of weird to think about but all of Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr, Monte Morris, and Aaron Gordon are 25 or younger. Plus, they have some other intriguing pieces include Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, PJ Dozier, and Markus Howard. They could run a respectable NBA rotation with just their young guys, which makes them all the more dangerous with some veteran signings."
This is the new Aaron Gordon trade.
Would trade for him if we hadn't gotten Aaron Gordon with Dozier and monte both are great passers and can create consistently on offense and bring some good defense and whatever pick compensation nessesarly. But right now a trade would require us to move mpj which honestly I'm not willing to do
"Think kelly and Aaron Gordon are two kinda similar cases in personality. They would, in a vacuum, like to go to a big market like NY or LA to show off their skills, but if they land on a good team like Gordon did in Denver, they’ll stay for the chance to compete at a high level"
KP at least has the skills to be a 2nd/3rd option on a winner. Ben at this point has to play the Aaron Gordon role on a winner... On a max.
Agreed and since we has Aaron Gordon trading for Simmons wouldn't make much sense. There wouldn't be enough offense.
Simmons is like Aaron Gordon but less scoring and more playmaking.  Hes a great player but needs a very special space carved out for him to be most effective.
"Agreed, I think he could be great as a nominal PF on a team with shooting at all the other positions (like a supercharged Denver Aaron Gordon)"
"Uhhh.. dlo, Ingram and lonzo are all decent players that I’d take over Simmons bloated contract at this point and definitely over Noel, Okafor fultz etc. realistically aaron Gordon probably too."
"as opposed to Aaron Gordon, Mr 3 point shooting contest champion lol"
I mean this is basically the role Aaron Gordon plays right now.  Simmons could play that role just fine if we didn’t have Gordon. But we do (for now). And I doubt we would give up any assets to make a swap or anything
If he just accepts he’s Aaron Gordon with better passing then yeah
"I know it's a Ben Simmons hate hour, but he's still noticeably better player than Aaron Gordon.   He need someone to relieve him of his ball-handling duties and to provide him with space for cuts, dunks and occasional post up. I can't think of a better player for that than Jokic."
"What does Simmons give the Nuggets over Aaron Gordon? Why would you ever want Simmons doing the playmaking instead of Murray or Jokic? And if Ben Simmons isn't playmaking, then what else is he doing for you that Aaron Gordon doesn't already provide? The upgrade in defense wouldn't really be worth the considerable drop in offense, I'd think."
Most players we think of as non-shooters still shoot but just not at great efficiency. Simmons just doesn't shoot at all. Simmons on the Nuggets would be similar to them telling Aaron Gordon to only go for layups with his off hand.
I believe he let Aaron Gordon get away with it
Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon as main piece
I think he would fit well with the Nuggets (replacing Aaron Gordon).
Simmons for Aaron Gordon.
You really want another Aaron Gordon on your team except he can't play offence?
Bench: Pat Bev and Aaron Gordon
I'm so glad we drafted Aaron Gordon over Devin Booker guys.  Cant you see how happy I am that we did that.   Don't regret it at all.  😃  see happy 😊
Aaron Gordon should be like team captain.
Denver should trade Aaron Gordon for Gary Harris
"Honestly, every game.  I remember when Aaron Gordon was the greatest player of all time after his first game with the Nuggets."
Aaron Gordon was in a China bball meme lol
Weird that Aaron Gordon is at this game
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
"Jokic also plays with a real PF and always has, which is really important. It means that if he gets drawn out of the paint he can get blown by and there will be someone to cover him. This is clearly something the Nuggets front office is aware of since they’ve gotten Millsap, Jerami Grant, and Aaron Gordon, all who are real PFs and not just wings playing up."
"The Snyder overreactions are dumb. We have no other players worth putting in, maybe Juwan Morgan wont look worse than Niang, but even then he's not doing shit as a small ball 5.   Jazz need more versatile players like Royce. We have no perimeter defense outside of him. Jrue Holiday, Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, Aaron Gordon, etc all got moved and we couldnt get any of them."
The Jazz will never be a big free market destination. Our best chance is to find a player that we can sub Rudy out for when a team goes 5 out (like an Aaron Gordon type of defender) and hope Donovan continues improving offensively.
"When I think of the Magic, I think of guys like Aaron Gordon, Vucevic, Fournier, and DJ Augustin."
"OKC one year did their own dunk comp with all the freak athletes they had, and Perry Jones was pulling some crazy shit. Did the under the legs dunk Aaron Gordon did a few years before he did it."
Seems like a poorly run franchise. Trading Fournier for two second rounders means you missed the boat. If your not competitive don’t wait until his contract is up to trade. Issac seems like a nice player not sure about a franchise player. Aaron Gordon was a waste of time. Fultz reclamation effort meh.  They need to bottom out and get a franchise player.  Seems to be the plan now.
"Could the rockets have gotten an additional 2 or 3 first round picks from another team for him?  Vucevic got 2 first rounders at the deadline by the way. Aaron Gordon got a 1st and RJ Hampton.  It is objectively way more than the Nets paid, regardless of the Rockets' subjective feelings"
You’re insane if you don’t think Aaron Gordon is going to get at least $18 mil.
What does Ben Simmons do significantly better that would cost 2x-3x as much as Aaron Gordon?
What does Ben Simmons do significantly better that would cost 2x-3x as much as Aaron Gordon?
"It was more my super-high belief in MPJ as the #2 and Murray’s inconsistency. I thought it made sense to put the ball in Jokic &amp; MPJ’s hands, but this playoffs has shown he is not quite ready for that…yet.  But, because he and Jokic aren’t the best defenders, having a defensive stalwart on the perimeter to keep them from going hard in the paint was something I thought would be extremely valuable. He basically would perform as a super-duper Aaron Gordon, which everyone agreed was a great addition to the team. At least that was the thought. Obviously, it didn’t happen so you’re probably right—it never made sense in the first place.  But, now, Simmons offense is just too much of a negative to where I don’t think anyone’s defense can compensate for that."
Then the Aaron Gordon drone dunk was a trainwreck
KAT is probably the best center to pair Simmons with now that Denver traded for Aaron Gordon. Towns can space the floor better than any center save maybe Jokic and Simmons helps cover for KAT on defense.
"I’ll always cringe at the the aaron Gordon dunk where he had the tik tok stars and dancers out on center court when he dunked.  Like great that added so much to the dunk, well done"
That Aaron Gordon dunk over the Orlando mascot spinning around on a hoverboard was super dope.
That was the wackest dunk ever almost as bad as that trash drone dunk Aaron Gordon did
Aaron Gordon to the Suns confirmed?
"But it creates this myth that you could get one of those guys and if they become available and get traded elsewhere it craters the value to a level below what you could have gotten if reasonable in the first place.  If Beal or Lilliard become available, Denver can drop the all star level player and high ceiling package for them by doing some combination of Murray, MPJ and Aaron Gordon."
How did Aaron Gordon find his way onto this list smh
"&gt;I'd say he is possibly the second best player on the team  Definitely not. When Jamal Murray is healthy, Barton becomes the 4th or even 5th best player on the team, depending on how good Aaron Gordon is offensively on that day."
"It was 10 games after Aaron Gordon arrived and before Jamal Murray got hurt.  Nuggets went 8-2 in those games, and beat some really good teams comfortably."
I love the Knicks going all in on being us even down to having a point guard who can't shoot and trying to get a Center who shoots threes.  Only difference and it's a big one is they have Randle and not Aaron Gordon at PF.
"A true pick-up game.  They have the captains, LeBron and Giannis probably, pick their teammates on the court.  They have other all stars stand at halfcourt.  They pick their teams.  Then a commercial break, then they play the game.  They scrap the Dunk Contest unless Zach Levine and Aaron Gordon agree to take part.  Instead of the Dunk Contest, they play Knock-Out (or as it is known in some areas, Lightning) from the 3 point line."
"I’d remove the dunk contest. It feels like we’ve seen it all, and star players rarely participate.   The most memorable recent dunk contest was when Dwyane Wade “messed up” his score as a judge, leading to a controversial Derrick Jones Jr win over Aaron Gordon."
"Aaron Gordon was the primary defender on kawhi that series I’m pretty sure, Isaac was on siakam. Probably wouldn’t have mattered, kawhi was giving it to everybody that playoff run."
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"Same.  I used to watch Aaron Gordon highlights on a daily basis, and then he goes out on the court and materialize into this?  I feel like he could have been way better."
"Two role players and a pick, that's basically what Magic got for Aaron Gordon.  I'd rather just hold onto Pascal if that's the offer, I don't see why we have to trade him lol."
Aaron Gordon
Because he stole the dunk contest from Aaron gordon
Ben Simmons would be his ceiling.  Aaron Gordon would be his floor.  IMO.
"Honestly the question that makes it difficult is who is the matching salary. You need to be able to send out 30 million bucks worth of dude for Ben Simmons without completely screwing your team post-trade.  For us the matching salary would have to be Aaron Gordon and Will Barton, but like, IDK if I even want to do that trade straight-up, Barton is our starting 2-guard and Aaron Gordon is like 85% of Ben Simmons for 60% of the money. Maybe if the concept is Gordon / JaMychal Green / Zeke Nnaji? IDK, still not even that stoked.  So you kind of have to be like ... who has 30 million bucks worth of slightly overpaid role player that would help the Sixers. Porzingis from Dallas? Cam Reddish and two of (Capela / Gallo / Bogdanovic - who has a trade kicker btw) from Atlanta? Bagley and one of Barnes / Hield from SAC? Hayward from CHA?"
Aaron Gordon is the worst I can think of but I’m not sure if he could
"What would you say a good age cutoff would be to train a different model on just older players? 32/33, or set it as in their 30s vs not?  In terms of identifying whether a player was on a tanking team, I feel like that could be a slippery slope in subdividing an already pretty small dataset (4 years of free agents from 2016, 982 observations). Is the classification tanking vs non-tanking, or do we split the league into top-10, middle-10, bottom-10? What if a player spends half a season on a tank then gets traded to a contender, a la Aaron Gordon this year?"
"I'm not the only who he sees Booker's look and is reminded of Aaron Gordon, right?"
Offense. They're sick and tired of trying to develop an athletic wing who can't shoot (Aaron Gordon).
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
Aaron Gordon	and Eric Gordon  I keep hearing the names and thinking the announcers are making a mistake.
"I really think Denver is the best spot for him.   They could run a *super* legit high/low with Jokic/Simmons, and Simmons wouldn’t need to be the primary ball handler as long as Murray and Jokic are healthy. He could comfortably be a dunker spot/baseline cutter in the Nuggets motion offense, and he could lead breaks off rebounds. Outside of that he could just really focus on playing defense. He’d be a super charged Aaron Gordon."
Ah yes I just got transported to 2014 and the magic fans are excited for a Oladipo Elfrid payton and Aaron Gordon core.
"I don’t agree that they play at the 5 when it matters most. I think they play at the 5 when their traditional big isn’t performing or there is a matchup to be exploited.  That said, my point is that while most GMs and coaches would prefer everyone on the court to have a triple, I don’t think a three-pointer is a prerequisite for a successful PF: Giannis, Draymond, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson don’t have a triple or have only shown it in spurts.  I’ll agree with you that these guys are increasingly anomalies and a PF with a 3 is generally preferred over one without, though."
Orlando fans beef with him. Probably with that minor Aaron Gordon thing. I think he regained a lot of respect around the league post the championship run and then in the 2020 season.
"There’s always an unlikely source.   Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon for Dame?  LeVert and Sabonis for Dame?  Lauri, Williams, Coby White for Dame?  This may start the framework of some deal, but there are teams and pieces out there."
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
There are better PFs too. We could have least gotten Aaron Gordon or John Collins or something at worst.
"The Denver Nuggets are one healthy season away from winning a championship. They're not exactly up and coming so people forget that they're still very young: Jokic is 26, Jamal is 24, MPJ is 23, Aaron Gordon is 25, and Monte Morris is 26. If everything falls into place, they have the potential to be a dynasty.  In the brightest timeline, MPJ becomes Tracy McGrady, Jamal proves that he's the real Maple Jordan, Aaron Gordon turns into Warriors Iggy,  Jokic is Jokic, and they go on to win three championships in four years.  The brightestest timeline also involves RJ Hampton coming back home when he's an all-star, future league MVP Aleksej Pokusevski choosing the hardest road and joining the Nuggets dynasty because he can't win with those cats, Tim Connelly drafting another generational superstar in the 2nd round (i.e. Kai Sotto), Jokic playing well into his 40s without any decline in his play, and Bol Bol finally taking the leap to become a serviceable NBA player.  Or everything goes to shit because nothing good ever happens. Either way you'll still have fun because every single Nuggets player is hard not to root for."
Remember when he awarded the dunk contest to his boy Derrick Jones over Aaron Gordon last year? After Gordon dunked over tacko fall?
2020 - Patrick Williams - Bulls   2019 De’Andre Hunter – Hawks   2018 Jaren Jackson Jr - Grizzlies   2017 Josh Jackson  – Suns   2016 Dragan Bender - Suns   2015 Kristaps Porzingis - Knicks   2014 Aaron Gordon  – Magic   2013 Cody Zeller - Bobcats   2012 Dion Waiters - Cavaliers   2011 Tristan Thompson - Cavaliers   2010 Wesley Johnson - Timberwolves   I wouldn’t trade Ben for a decade of number four picks now that the unicorn has vanished.
"From 2010-2019, the number 4 picks have been deandre hunter, jaren Jackson, josh Jackson, dragan bender, KP, Aaron Gordon, Cody zeller, dion waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Wesley Johnson. How many all star appearances do those guys have between them, 1 (KP in 2018)? The draft is a massive crapshoot, prob bigger than people think Edit: JJJ and hunter are obviously good young players, but the median player in that list is probably Tristan Thompson"
Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon.
"Orlando Magic have been horrible at drafting for the last 7 seasons. They picked defensive specialist Mo Bamba 6th while SGA, MPJ, Sexton, Miles, Mikal, GTJ who are more fan favored offensive players were still on the board. They picked another defensive specialist the previous year at 6th with Mitchell, Bam, John Collins yet to be picked. Hell, picking Kuzma, Dennis Smith jr, Markkanen or Monk would've been more exciting for the fans. Dallas picked DSJ 9th who is basically out of the league now but they still sold the heck out of him in that one season of inefficient volume scoring and athletic showmanship. Going back further, they picked Aaron Gordon 4th who actually did generate some buzz and I'm sure there was no shortage of Orlando fans clamoring to see him succeed in the stands early in his career. The year before that, they picked Oladipo 2nd, who played like a prototypical volume scoring lottery pick and got the fans going but apparently he was also picked for his defense- WTF Orlando! Stop picking players for their defense in the top 6 when you don't have an offensive superstar."
"Aaron Gordon in a full season with Denver becomes an All Star and All Defensive player. Denver has 3 all stars next year in Jokic, MPJ and Gordon😬"
Aaron Gordon was drafted in 2014.  Same age as cam Johnson drafted in 2019
Damn. We’re at that point where we’d rather have Aaron Gordon over Wiggins. I’m not disagreeing its just that …. my heart kinda hurts seeing that man
Would love a front court player like Siakam or Aaron Gordon. Would not be surprised if Zach LaVine or Sabonis were part of Discussions. I think Siakam is the most likely acquisition
"Orlando :  Cole Anthony, Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Isaac, Sabonis"
"He still had Aaron Gordon, Porter Jr. As the MVP that should have been enuff to win or steal at least 2 games"
didn't the lavine vs aaron gordon legendary slam dunk contest happened in 2016 too?  edit: its in the post im dumb
Aaron Gordon in small?
"Paul George, Jimmy, Kawhi, AD, Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Justice Winslow to name a few."
"I’ve long felt Aaron Gordon practices fuckboi tiktok influencer faces in the mirror. If Giannis does it, AG is *definitely* doin it."
"Aaron Gordon was a great addition, he just tried to do too much in the playoffs when they were missing so many players. If they stay healthy and have another year of development, they’re a serious contender, if not borderline favorites as is"
"Ayton doesn't really try to contest at the apex, he just likes to stay in front and keep his hands up. Aaron Gordon did really well against Giannis with the Magic but, Giannis has turned into a different animal since then."
"What type of basketball are the Bucks playing, Aaron Gordon Ball?"
"Oh neither do I at all. I am actually of the opinion that a lot of players today with high assist number don’t help their team mates. Prime example being James harden on the rockets when 4 guys stood around and waited to catch and shoot. But that’s not what Jokic does at all. My take is from watching Jokic every game this year, and listening to interviews from guys like Austin rivers and Aaron Gordon who came in and raved about playing with Jokic. But I will definitely argue that Jokic has more positive affect on his teammates than Embiid."
"Someone like Simmons would slot amazingly into a Dame/Powell/X/RoCo/Nurkic lineup.  Aaron Gordon would too, though I'm sure Denver is keen on retaining him to contend next year."
"By adding Aaron Gordon to their line up, Nuggets went on a 9-1 run in the regular season before Murray went down. Gordon then had to take on his role which is not what he was added into the roster for. So yes, this Nuggets team would have been dangerous if he was still playing."
And when you look at that draft it was pretty spotty that high:  1. Wiggins  2. Jabari Parker  3. Embiid  4. Aaron Gordon  5. Exum  6. Marcus Smart  7. Julius Randle  8. Stauskas  9. Vonleh  10. Elfrid Payton  Obviously Embiid is the best choice but I don't fault anybody for not wanting to gamble on him. After that Randle and Smart are the only other two guys really worth a damn and it took Randle awhile. Maybe Gordon with a full training camp and season with Denver. But the rest of it is pretty fucking yikes.  So ending up with Kevin Love and a title was a pretty good return.
"Aaron ""Tobias Harris"" Gordon"
Let's not pretend like Porter is some elite rim protector. Denver has done pretty well on defense with traps but and Jokic being better than people want to give him credit for but they probably have a ceiling with the defense unfortunately.  Oddly enough Jerami Grant plus Aaron Gordon together would alleviate a ton of the problems they have.
"For fun:  Aaron Gordon: $23m  10 PPG, 6 RPG, 2 APG, 56 TS%  Kyle Kuzma: $13m  12 PPG, 7 RPG, 2 APG, 54 TS%"
Idk man Portland signed Norman Powell for 5yrs 90 mil with no player options. I could be biased but I definitely see Norman Powell as better than Aaron Gordon. Even for a small market this seems like a huge overpay.
Aaron Gordon? More like Aaron Gorgeous
Aaron Gordon seems to always be one year alway from being the guy people expected him to be. This is one of those contracts that ages poorly the second it breaks news. Denver about to get hella expensive with a potential MPJ extension going through
I could be wrong but this feels like a pretty big overpay. Duncan Robinson and Norman Powell got 5yr 90 mil and both (to me) are definitely better than Aaron Gordon. Obviously they’re different types of players but that seems like a massive deal.
Aaron Gordon is who he is lol there won't be any breaking out for him. He's had all of Orlando to expand his game and he can't be consistent
With cap rises I guess we have to start getting used to a world where Aaron Gordon-level players get 20+ million
It's a bit weird considering MPJ is most likely getting maxed while Aaron Gordon feels like more a player in the 4/72-4/80 range
"I think if you could remove Simmons's attitude, he would be an elite fit on the Nuggets.  If you could build a trade centered around Aaron Gordon, Bones Hyland and however many picks (I know the 6ers wouldn't do this btw), a line up of Murray, Barton/Morris/Dozier, MPJ, Simmons and Jokic would be unstoppable.  However, Simmons would not be happy playing in Denver as the fourth option, so for chemistry reasons it would never work."
Nuggets are theoretically a good fit (or at least Jokic and Murray are) but Aaron gordon complicates things since they play the same position and the Sixers likely have no interest in him.
Wow with sunglasses on Tyler Herro looks a ton like Aaron Gordon.
Aaron Gordon.
Dunk Champion: Aaron Gordon
"Yeah I remember the first player drafted that was younger than me, Aaron Gordon was born literally the day after me. Now the latest milestone is that I'm older than almost everybody who's getting their second/max contract, which feelsbadman."
I remember seeing Aaron Gordon get drafted and realizing that he was just a few years older than me.
The Aaron Gordon special.
"Yes. But it depends on one question: Is Aaron Gordon enough on D? Is Jokic average on D now? Can MPJ be average on D?  Team has its offense sorted, now it just needs to get just good enough on the other side to make it work. It's a shame they're not going after Simmons more."
Love seeing underdog NorCal schools take out Mater Dei in states. Like Jeremy Lin in the late 2000s and Aaron Gordon almost did in 2013.
"What? For starters he’s a great defender. He’s a post defender/ help defender. He’s not gonna wow you visually but he’s gonna elevate the teams defence with his presence. That’s what the metrics have shown for years and that’s what teams want defensively.   And he didn’t get that many minutes in the Denver series cause Denver had a log jam at his position. They wanted to play Jamychal green more due to his shooting since they desperately needed it without Jamal, and they had Aaron Gordon as a starter. Not that many minutes left to go around"
"Idk why u getting downvoted. Luka always cooks Jrue. Guys like Bev and Jrue dont create problems for Luka.  You need a mobile wing on Luka to slow him down aka Kawhi, M Bridges, Aaron Gordon, Simmons etc."
Aaron Gordon actually isn’t bad unlike a lot of these other guys.
"Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Jordan Clarkson, and Aaron Gordon"
Kind of like what Denver did with Aaron Gordon last year.  I could see it.
&gt;I had no idea Aaron Gordon was an elite defender  I just found out today
"To be fair, Aaron Gordon has already kinda proven he can’t be a legit #1 option so teams probably won’t throw money at him like that.  But the other guy has a point, we do have to overpay our players a bit."
"So reading this comment made me curious what kind of fit I could find for ben. Booted up 2k and started a new myleague season.   (Disclaimer: the roster I used was from around the trade deadline I think so obv this wouldn't be viable at all rn.)   I made a 3 team trade between Nuggets, 76ers, Nets.  Denver receives: Ben Simmons  76ers receive: Aaron Gordon, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nuggets 1st round 2023, Nuggets 2nd round 2023  Nets Receive: Paul Millsap, Nuggets 1st round 2025, Nuggets 2nd round 2022  Denver: &gt;Give up Gordon and Millsap but get Ben Simmons who is switched to the 4 to play alongside Jokic. I think Simmons could end up being a younger better Aaron Gordon for the Nuggets if he's playing out of the 4.   76ers:  &gt;No longer have Ben crowding the paint at PG. Get Aaron Gordon to basically do what ben did for cheaper and he doesn't have to also be your guard. Spencer Dinwiddie becomes the starting point and can actually space the floor and handle the ball to take pressure off Embiid.   Nets:  &gt;Give up Dinwiddie but they already had Harden and Irving so didn't really need him all **that** much. End up getting Millsap just like IRL and some future draft picks to either flip for more vets or bolster their roster in a few years as their vets begin to age out.   So what do you think? Honestly I think it worked out not so bad for all 3 teams. I'm gonna sim the season out to see how they end up."
"Aaron Gordon + Will Barton, 1st   Or   Gordon , Porter Jr., Jam Green"
"Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris, lottery protected 1st round pick. But idk if we should even give up Morris"
I had no idea Aaron Gordon was an elite defender
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
Aaron Gordon? But I’d probably want a pick back for him.
"Lol I know, right? Maybe Aaron Gordon has to be in there, and I think that helps both sides - though the Nuggets are very happy with AG"
"I wouldn't make an offer for him. He doesn't fit the Magic's timeline. They traded Aaron Gordon, Vucevic and Evan Fournier because they were determined to tank and trend younger. Plus I don't think he'd take to being in a small franchise."
I'm surprised Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon haven't tried. Or Paul George either.
Aaron Gordon and OJ mayo
"Jalen Johnson, BJ Boston, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Trey Lyles, JJJ, etc. There were a bunch of NBA guys there."
and aaron gordon
"I’d add Porzingis to that list too.   I also disagree about Jokic, I think Simmons would be a very good fit with him. Jokic runs a lot of the offense from the perimeter, and Simmons is basically a better version of Aaron Gordon who was a great fit with the Nuggets when everyone was healthy."
"Aaron Gordon.  To be clear, I'm not suggesting the team is perfect right now, just saying ideally it is crucial to pair Jokic with a good defending PF.  Whether or not Gordon is good enough is tbd.  Gordon was real good last year, but he needs to step up even more honestly.  And ideally we would have a rim protector off the bench.  We currently don't have that"
"By ‘stay on the court’ I assume you mean in the playoffs..When the nuggets played your fav team in the regular season or in the bubble there was a high chance that Porter was dropping 30..In 20+ straight playoffs games he has failed to make any consistent impact, even going as far as being benched in crunch time this playoffs..It’s the same thing with Aaron Gordon..Really demoralizing to see the weight of the whole team fall on Jokic and Murray"
"&gt;you could have traded one off them before that became an issue  ""You could've traded a player before you realized if he was good enough to keep.""  Wow maybe you should lend that crystal ball you seem to have to the Sixers lol  &gt;fultz has played nothing but point in the NBA he isn’t a combo guard.  Further admitting you knew nothing about Fultz as a prospect.  &gt;you cannot justify drafting three centres in a row  ""Nerlens was good enough to be a starting center for the Sixers!!1!""  Thank fuck they didn't do what you're suggesting because then we'd be stuck with Nerlens and Aaron Gordon as two of our starters lmfao  &gt;two point guards in a row  *One point forward and one combo guard.* Fixed that for you.  &gt;you could have had a line up that resembled Simmons, CJ, Tatum, KP and Embiid instead of what you drafted.  Again, lend your crystal ball!  You don't know what you're talking about, my man. Just move on and spend your time more productively. I can tell you have a compulsion to get the last word so I'll give it to you out of kindness. I'm sorry you're so averse to admitting when you're objectively wrong."
He's basically Aaron Gordon
They haven't even gone against the Clippers. The Nuggets had substantially improved their roster when they added Aaron Gordon to their roster. They went on a 9-1 run as soon as he played for them. Who knows what would have happened if Murray and almost half their squad wasn't injured.
aaron gordon lookin fly in those sweats
Aaron Gordon was ballin’ out
Aaron Gordon looks like a tall Lil Bow Wow in Like Mike with the baggy clothes and hair haha
I feel like Aaron Gordon is at every single run posted to social media
Aaron gordon needs to buy some shorts
The warriors office would be absolutely moronic to do this. However we can give them Aaron Gordon and bol bol and iw would be happy
Wiggins  has no more impact in his career then Aaron Gordon. You can easily argue Aaron has had more impact.
"No, there are other agents that represent Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Aaron Gordon, Ant Edwards etc. But Rich Paul has clients on 4 west playoff teams not counting the Lakers."
"If Denver has to involve MPJ or Murray, then Denver should hang up immediately. I’m thinking more of a package of Monte Morris + Aaron Gordon + Bones Hyland/Zeke Nnaji and two-three first round picks. Not the greatest offer, but the Simmons trade market is pretty dry"
"Salary-wise, plenty.  * Boston: Al Horford  * Denver: Aaron Gordon + Monte Morris  * Portland: Covington + Derrick Jones Jr.  * LAC: Bledsoe + Kennard  * etc etc.  A lot of competitive teams have 1-2 bigger contracts they'd be fine parting with.   It's just those trades + picks aren't enough to compete with what Minnesota/Sacramento/Cleveland can offer up."
Are you a fake Magic fan or something? Ben wouldn't even fit on a tanking team. It'd be the same issue the team had with Aaron Gordon
We'll give you an aaron gordon
"&gt; not having a proper back up center fucked us.  While certainly a big problem, the bigger issue, IMO, was starting 3 6'3 or shorter guys against Denver running 3 6'10+ guys.  Powell is a good defender, but you can't expect him to guard MPJ or Aaron Gordon.  Their stats went way down against the Suns.  The lack of a playable SF was a big deal."
"Agreed, but the dunk contest with Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine is definitely hands down the best dunk contest ever.   Prove me wrong.   I loved J Rich and Vince and all, but dayum."
"For sure and tickets will be cheap! I remember enjoying games in 16/17 and 17/18 where our ‘young core’ was Aaron gordon, Mario hezonja, and Elfrid payton and loving it lol. I have a feeling this group will deliver a bit more than the last."
Paul Millsap was far better at his age when he got his contract than Aaron Gordon is at his current age
ATL - Trae BOS - Tatum BKN - Jarrett Allen CHA - Bridges CHI - MJ CLE - LBJ DAL - Luka DEN - Jokic DET - Isiah  GSW - Curry HOU - Harden IND - Sabonis LAC - PG LAL - Kobe MEM - Conley MIA - Butler MIL - Giannis MIN - KAT NOP - Ingram NYK - Melo OKC - … Perkins ORL - Aaron Gordon PHI - AI PHX - Booker POR - Dame SAC - Boogie SAS - Timmy TOR - Lowry UTA - Gobert WAS - Beal
And you guys have all the versatile tall people.   Joker. Bol Bol. Zeke Nnaji. Aaron Gordon. PJ Dozier.....  Scary long bois
Aaron gordon
Are you forgetting about MPJ and the fact that they'll have better chemistry with Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon.
"Yeah too bad he couldn't carry Campazo (40yo rookie), Montee Morris (undrafted), Austin Rivers (out of NBA), Aaron Gordon (just traded for), and MPJ out of the 2nd round against a stacked Suns team."
Gonna be traumatic for Aaron Gordon to face the Bulls this season.
"He's an awesome switchblade player, but not much of a scorer. Think smarter Aaron Gordon with less offense."
"&gt; Better than iq and obi  Highly debatable, specially IQ and Allen. Also, our picks are better, we have more to offer and they got Harden dude. It wasn't just a random star.  &gt; I know you didn’t just call Aaron Gordon a star  You serious right now? You're from Milwaukee dude. Jrue."
&gt;Levert and Allen  Better than iq and obi  &gt;Bledsoe and Hampton   I know you didn’t just call Aaron Gordon a star  &gt;Jerome and oubs and kuz  Went for Past prime guys who were considered overpaid at the time?
"Nance is great but honestly he deserves more money for his next contract and there's no reason for them to be the ones to give it to him long term when they can get other younger players. that said, this is definitely the biggest deal for the Blazers, for sure, because they wanted Aaron Gordon and he basically is Aaron Gordon, if not better. I'm really high on Nance, especially on a hopeful contender."
"Dwight, Aaron Gordon"
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
"Per IG, Simmons, Rondo, Jordan Clarkson, Justise Winslow, JJJ, Jarred Vanderbilt, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Brandon Clarke, BJ Boston were at the most recent run, and Michael Beasley, Lonnie Walker, Ja, Maxey, and Bazely have gone to other ones."
"Rondo, Simmons, JJJ, Aaron Gordon?"
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
"Larry nance jr , Aaron Gordon, Blake griffin self explanatory"
"Twolves but KAT would leave if we packaged DLO. Also Simmons wouldn't re-sign with us, OKC, or IND.  Nets is really interesting but KD and Harden would also nix a Kyrie trade.  A bunch teams like POR have nothing to offer.  ATL, GS, or LAC make the most sense. But are probably too loyal with their current cores.  I'm going to guess DEN trades Aaron Gordon+players+picks. IMO that's a better fit for 76ers and DEN is looking for something to push them into a championship team."
Blake Griffin -&gt; miles bridges-&gt; Aaron Gordon. Unfortunately Blake devolved :/
Aaron Gordon   Pascal Siakam  Giannis   All around 2 way PF with a spotty jumper
"Lebron, Jason tatum, Brandon Ingram (could replace Jason with Aaron Gordon possibly)"
Mikal Bridges vs Aaron Gordon
"Zion is a legitimate freak, he's probably the strongest forward in the game already. KD, Simmons and Aaron Gordon are also in that freak athlete tier. Edwards and Lavine for guards."
"&gt; the same people said the same things about Embiid in the 2014 draft. He had massive injury concerns, required surgery immediately, and many saw him as a big risk as a big man who’s body couldn’t hold up in the NBA  TBH I see Embiid still as an injury concern on a team nowadays (just like in 2014 draft) but even knowing that, I would have picked him #1.  The important missing context here, is that neither Wiggins, Jabari, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle or LaVine in that draft were on the same level of KD to even have that kind of conversation. Wiggins was viewed at the time for the potential to be a good 2-way player, but I don't remember people talking about him as a super all-star like KD"
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
"Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Aaron Gordon, PJ Dozier"
"Jokic, Murray, MPJ, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon. pretty much would have to be those 5. not sold on Gordon, but you're not giving him up for nothing in that scenario. don't think you protect Barton or Dozier over Morris."
This isn't a post about Ben simmons. Nothing about my comment was salty. I am simply trying to start a discussion about the culture surrounding the idea of a player working on his game and posting clips of them playing/practicing on social media during the off-season and the way people react to it. The impetus for this post was based on a drill I saw Aaron Gordon post. Also unless you're a 76ers fan who is disappointed in the growth or lack there of demonstrated by Ben Simmons over the course of his career in regards to your team (the 76ers) winning I truly don't understand why you'd feel so slighted or disdained at the mere idea of him posting videos of himself playing basketball to social media regardless of whether they indicate his true growth as a basketball player. They are simply posts on social media
This is what I'm saying fr and it extends to other stars as well. I saw a post of Aaron Gordon working on his post game and someone came at his neck for no reason saying he'll never be able to pull that off in a real game. It's just such a weird thing to say as if we know what's best for stars to practice or what they're even practicing when the cameras are off
Only for maybe 5 minutes when he beat Aaron Gordon in a dunk contest one time
"this was the oddest rank I saw too  the magic had a worse record last year and have lost Aaron Gordon, Vuc, and  Fournier"
"&gt; god, why cant we get Aaron Gordon as our 4  Nuggets fans learned the hard way that Aaron Gordon fucking sucks"
"For mavs, i always push Finney-Smith as 2/3 than 3/4 on defense. he's too lanky to face average to big wing. guards and small wing should be his assignment. god, why cant we get Aaron Gordon as our 4?!  for old mavs, Parsons should be playing PF. imagine how many slow big that he can abuse at that time  for kings, put back HB as 3 again!"
"Not sure why you’re being downvoted, you’re being reasonable, even though I don’t 100% agree.  You don’t have to get the most lobs per game to be the best lob finisher. Hell the best lob finisher in the world might not even be in the nba. It’s like dunking, it’s a skill that we could declare someone the best at based on perceived ability more than raw output  We might say Aaron Gordon (for example) is the best dunker in the nba even if he doesn’t get the most dunks in game.   Agreed that in order to be the biggest lob “threat” you ought to have the numbers to back it up, but the original comment you responded to was referring to his skill as a finisher moreso than being a threat."
yes it does. cj at the time is a better player than mpj. they both suck on defense . dame and jokic are both mvp level players. i prefer jokic but dame is still good. nurkic as a third option is comparable to aaron gordon. then you go into the part that makes portland better norman powell is better than everyone else on the nuggets. the players that were missing from the nuggets drop their depth alot. robert covington is better too than most of the rest of the nuggets players. pj doizer will barton and jamal all out they trade away monte morris for gordon. pretty much had no guards left over. then you have enes a turn style on defense but can give you a good 5 minutes when jokic. on paper blazer are much better than the injured nuggets. coaching really did them a big diservice. terry stotts should have been fired years ago.
Haha.  Aaron Gordon is Mo Speights fam.
"Kawhi needs a more complementary team? Did you not see KD having to leave the thunder to go play with Steph Klay and Draymond??? Kawhi took Lowry and Siakam as his two best players to win a championship.  And for the defensive competition aspect, go take a look at 2019. Kawhi averaged 30.5 ppg on 49/38/88 shooting splits while going up against defenders such as: Aaron Gordon, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokuompo, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala.  I'll wait for you to let me know when KD has ever faced that many elite defenders in one playoff run.  Also, I remember when KD was going crazy vs the Pat Beverly Clippers, people didn't seem to care about how shitty the defenders he was playing."
"&gt; They’ll have a very young core of MPJ, Jokic, and Murray locked up long term.   They have Murray and Jokic under contract, but MPJ is extension eligible and they haven't locked him up yet. They may extend him before the season starts, but Denver is notoriously cheap, and has not gone into the luxury tax for a dozen years. I don't think it's at all a guarantee that they give MPJ the extension he'll no doubt be looking for, just like it's not a guarantee they re-sign Aaron Gordon. If they're willing to spend they should be in good shape, but Kroenke is really cheap, despite how rich he is."
"Ehhh, this Blazers team has generally been pretty good in the regular season.  6th seed in the West last year despite CJ and Nurk being out for like half the season.  I think Chauncey would have to be a really bad coach or a Lillard injury for this team to fall apart in the regular season.  The team has too much offense to not do fine in the regular season.    The issue is playoffs where the refs allow more contact and the teams play harder defense.  Portland just doesn't have the size to compete with teams that throw multiple 6'10 forwards out there (like Denver did).  Norman Powell shouldn't be guarding Aaron Gordon or MPJ."
Aaron Gordon liked this post*
Denver also good with Aaron Gordon and [Jokic](https://youtube.com/shorts/dzWq_-RtFfA?feature=share)
"Helped John Wall get a bag, right after Draymond signed with Klutch, he got that huge extension, he got Aaron Gordon that huge extension as well, etc"
"Backcourt has a different significance when your center runs the offense. Campazzo isn’t bad either. Don’t forget that Jokic had MPJ and Aaron Gordon too.  Not hating, I agree that he’s the best center in the league, just saying what he did in the playoffs wasn’t some Herculean feat.  Blazers equally lost the series - their team was essentially only Dame performing well that entire series"
"I'm just shitposting in the subreddit. But if you want my real opinion of Aaron Gordon, I think he's a fine player who is grossly overpaid. He's a bigger better version of MKG or (insert tweener who doesn't really do anything special). I'm glad Denver got better in the trade, more contenders in the West is good. I think that squad will work out well if and when everyone is healthy at the same time."
"If Aaron Gordon is the best player in a trade, I'm out."
"I think every fanbase has these people, the Lakers are just the biggest fanbase so you hear more takes from them than you do Magic or Grizzlies or Kings fans.  I have heard some legendarily bad takes from fellow Magic fans (i.e. ""Aaron Gordon is a superstar, we should have gotten more from Denver for him""), but they don't get plastered all over r/nba because we have no fans. I'm sure plenty of Lakers fans just roll their eyes and stay quiet because they know it's not worth engaging those people."
Aaron Gordon just signed for 4 years 78m or so and Monte Morris is signed for another 2 years 24m
"&gt;NBA GM Survey - Which team has the most promising young core?  &gt;Atlanta Hawks - 50% &gt;Houston Rockets - 10% &gt;Boston Celtics - 7% &gt;Memphis Grizzlies - 7% &gt;New Orleans Pelicans - 7% &gt;Phoenix Suns - 7%  The Nuggets have an MVP, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon and their average age is 26.5. They probably only didn’t make the Finals last year because Jamal Murray was out."
Essentially boils down to playoff losses and on the court beef between lowry and aaron gordon (i think gordon got hurt from a lowry play but they have had some on the court back and forth).   Whenever there’s an interaction between the raps and magic I’ll slide over there to read the takes and have a laugh.
"Lmfao he’s a magic fan bro, gotta lowe them. They have a huge chip against toronto, its pretty jokes tbh. They literally say “FKL” as like a mantra (meaning fuck kyle lowry) and this kid has an aaron gordon flair. Definitely a raptors victim, lowe him."
But Joel was considered the best player in the draft. 76ers were lucky to get him because of his injury history. Why are you being obtuse referencing Dante Exum? Aaron Gordon went before him and he’d have been an excellent fit for Philly had they not taken Embiid.
Josh Smith Marvin Williams Jeff Green Batum Marion Harrison Barnes Josh Childress Michael Carter William Richard Jefferson Kyle Anderson Shareef Abdur-Rahim Paul Millsap Brian Shaw Beno Udrih Aaron Gordon Fultz Stephen Jackson Caron Butler Tuerie Evans Lance Stephenson
"Aaron Gordon comes to my mind. He can do a liiiittle bit of everything, but none of them well enough to rely on it. His best trait is being a solid perimeter defender against bigger wings and fastbreaks."
Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon
"It 100% depends on the system around you. I’m just pointing to the countless attempts at super teams that have flopped while the only outliers I can recall are the Heat, Cavs and Warriors. Let’s point to the Sixers 3 seasons ago against the Raptors. Simmons and Lowry were around the same level at the time, Redick was better than Danny Green, Kawhi was better than Butler, Harris was arguably better than Siakam at the time and Embiid was obviously better than Gasol. The team put together 4 guys who were all star players and put him next to a sniper from range. They still lost though. You could argue they lost by lucky last shot which is fair, but it shouldn’t have got to that point to begin with based on talent on that roster. You’re right in saying good coaching does wonders and I agree, but what if you replaced Jimmy with a guy like Khris Middleton, who can shoot from anywhere, doesn’t always need the ball in his hands, and is great on defence as well. Then have someone like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon at the 4 instead of Tobias. I personally think that team would’ve been way better than the one the Sixers had constructed. Despite the three maybe not being as good of players as the players previously on the team, their fit is better and the coaches job becomes easier."
"My ex was a huge 76rs fan and the past 5 years I’ve watched most of their games. They are still my number two team. Joel is dominate and if you don’t enjoy watching the joy he plays with when he is on you are dead inside.   A defensive big who can space and move off ball well is a pretty spot on distribution of what Aaron Gordon does, and Grant before him. Simmons would feast in that role as well. A really good playmaker from the guard is easier to find, but finding our need isn’t impossible by any means.  Joel has had serious issues with underperforming in clutch situations. Getting swept by the Celtics and his late game turnovers this year exposed some places that are holding his team back. Shot creation without Simmons has also been an issue of his. You could build a championship team around Embiid a bit easier using more a traditional scheme but you can build a better team around Jokic."
“Aaron Gordon was robbed twice in the dunk contest”
"Ok but Kuzma actually did spend four years in college and graduated with a degree. It's part of the reason he looked like he could hang with Ingram and Lonzo his first few years in the league - he was significantly older than them.  Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, and a few months younger than Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins, they were one-and-doners and he did four years at Utah."
So he'll only get the Aaron Gordon Salary upfront and not the whole Ben Simmons amount
"Trae Young 5yr / $207 Biased but 100% worth   Michael Porter Jr. 5yr / $172M Hot take: Will never sign another big deal, but not due to basketball reasons Just from a basketball standpoint I think it's an overpay. He was stupid hot last year and won't keep up the %  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 5yr / $172 Probably worth, right now an okayish max, if he improves definitely worth  Jamal Murray 5yr / 170M Not worth, he can give you 50 on some nights but on average is not worth the max imo  De'Aaron Fox 5yr / $163M Will be worth it  Terry Rozier 4yr / $97M Clowned the Hornets for signing him to 3/57, turned out he's good. Will be the better guard out if him and Lamelo for the majority of the contract and worth it  Aaron Gordon 4yr / $92M Imo slight overpay, but still an okay contract If he improves a bit, especially scoring wise he'll live up to it"
"Let’s say instead, Philly drafted the player that was immediately picked after their pick. Would this be a better team? Ben McLemore Steven Adams Aaron Gordon Zach Lavine Kristaps Porzingis Brandon Ingram London Ball"
Rozier's contract is absolutely not worse than Aaron Gordon who got paid for 10ppg and 6/10 defence.
You mean the same Aaron Gordon who shit the bed in the playoffs?
my bad thought I was in the Aaron Gordon part of the thread. His contract + MPJ is really rough for the other pieces of their small forward/PF spots.
You think a team led by Antivax KD and Aaron Gordon is making the playoffs in the West?
Aaron Gordon in high school
"There are only so many hyper athletic 6’10 guys who can fulfill that role effectively AND bring great defense on top of it   Not true at all that almost anyone can do that. Look at Aaron Gordon, he fulfills the same role but arguably worse than Simmons and is paid almost the max while not providing the same value on defense"
Denver is going to be proper fucked on cap space in a few years. That Aaron Gordon contract was legit awful
Watched Aaron Gordon destroy my school for 4 years straight.  These guys really make the game look easy
"Atlanta has more Depth but Denver has a big 3, so they have more star power, which is why they’re in similar positions  We gotta remember Denver was 8-0 when Aaron Gordon came mid season and Jamal Murray was still playing, it’s a short sample size but that goes to show you the potential their core has.  They had 3 guys averaging 20 last year while Atalanta had more guys averaging 10+"
"Aaron Gordon.  Dude’s probably never making the next leap, but I’m glad that he’s found a decent role on the Nuggets."
"2011 - Vuc -&gt; Shumpert  2012 - Maurice Harkless -&gt; Royce White   2013 - MCW -&gt; Steven Adams   2014 - Embiid -&gt; Aaron Gordon  2015 - Jah -&gt; Kristaps  we'd be god awful, man.  Any scenario in which we don't draft Embiid and this team is essentially the Kings"

"Whoaaaaa…. There’s definitely a timeline where he earns every penny of this. His 3pt shooting gives this team exactly the spacing that they need with the offense running through Jokic. With that said, it’s pretty risky and basically cements the nuggets core as what it currently is barring any sort of trade. With this move and the Aaron Gordon extension they must be hard capped AF."
Wow this is an even bigger overpay than the Aaron Gordon deal... Nuggets fans better pray this work out lol
"Aaron Gordon, Will Barton/JaMychal Green, Bones/Zeke and 1st round picks is best Nuggets can offer. Not sure if it gets a star but this is better than what Pelicans got for Jrue honestly"
We've got Aaron Gordon too.  And your team literally just turned a bunch of garbage into Russell Westbrook.
Aaron Gordon is more of a Ringo Starr if we're calling this a big four.
Jamal murray will get picked on just like Steph did. They have Aaron gordon and at most 1 more good defender in there best lineups. It’s concerning.
"Our last healthy season we went to the WCF and lost to the eventual champions; defense seemed to be fine enough for that, and we also added Aaron Gordon who has been a revelation for us on that end."
"Murray is average at best and at 6’2 he’s getting picked on every play in the playoffs, Aaron gordon can’t defend the entire court if you have 3 easy targets"
"Eh, thats 3 guys in your starting lineup you can pick on every play. Aaron gordon can’t defend the entire court. They’re not as good as Brooklyn to be able to get away with not having defense"
KPJ went from being cut by the Cavs to being a center piece of Houstons future. Could also throw Aaron Gordon in there now that he has a defined role on a contender. Reggie Jackson as well.
Campazzo ran shit lmfao. It was stressful watching Aaron Gordon though
You see what Aaron Gordon is getting?  I'm okay with JC's contract.
Yeah the only way they get Simmons is if they can build a package around Aaron Gordon I think.
"As others have said, Denver says no. To give a more nuanced answer, I just don't think Simmons works as well in Denver as you seem to. Firstly, Denver just extended Aaron Gordon, who's basically a worse but more balanced Ben Simmons. Versatile defender, competent playmaker, and an inconsistent shooter. I don't think Gordon and Simmons could play alongside Jokic together. There just wouldn't be enough shooting and spacing. Secondly, MPJ isn't an iso player at this point. That's realistically been his biggest offensive weakness. So Simmons would be asked to do much more playmaking than just getting the ball to MPJ or Jokic, but his complete lack of jumpshot would prevent him from having as deadly of a two-man game with Jokic as Murray.  I just don't think Denver would be interested in Simmons unless it's basically a one-for-one swap of Simmons for Gordon, which can't happen for six months since Gordon just signed an extension."
Denver already got their Ben Simmons-lite in Aaron Gordon. I think the pieces they have now fit better than the alternative
Same thing Aaron Gordon did against Phoenix
Simmons on the Nuggets makes absolutely no sense.  I'd rather have Jokic have the ball more often plus he needs shooters and slashers around him.  Also they just paid Aaron Gordon.
"I didn't realize a team needed two MVPs to make the finals, and if he is a Booker quality player we literally just saw Booker make the finals as a 2nd or first best player so it's totally possible. Nevermind the fact that two years ago they were in the WCF and MPJ has developed more and they picked up Aaron Gordon. Even if Murray isn't that guy, Jokic is."
Aaron Gordon made less aesthetically pleasing dunks than Derrick Jones Jr so dj Jr won
"Only an elite offensive player for 2 years? Bullshit. The stats have said Jokic has been an elite offensive player literally since he started playing in the NBA.  He was also the first team All NBA center 3 years ago so you're full of shit.  Last - this idea that Kawhi had to carry the Clips offense more than Jokic had to carry the Nuggets in the playoffs is straight up *wild* considering, again, PG13 exists, and was healthy. PG averaged 29 against the Mavs so is he also an all time offensive player? 9.5 boards and 5 apg too (slightly more than Kawhi did on that front). Reggie Jackson meanwhile averaged 18 ppg against the Mavs.  For comparison, the Nuggets next highest scorers against the Blazers after Jokic (again, 33 ppg) were MPJ - 18 ppg, and Monte Morris, 15 ppg and Aaron Gordon, 12 ppg vs Portland. Everyone else was 10 ppg or below for the Nuggets vs Portland. Not a single other player averaged double figures. Marcus Morris averaged 13 ppg for the Clips, Terance Mann 10, to go along with those PG + Reggie Jackson. It's not a close comparison here as to who had to shoulder a larger burden on offense. Not even a little close."
"Jeff Green, Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris?"
"They could, but doesn’t Philly want more than Aaron Gordon and some late 1sts for Simmons?"
Well Michael porter was damn good last year and Aaron Gordon compliments their big 3 really well.  Bojan is a nice scorer/spacer but not a good defender.  Jazz have better top end depth but nuggets go 10 deep
Aaron Gordon
Jokic does not have a snowballs chance in hell of winning MVP of a marathon. But Aaron Gordon might.
"Probably Aaron Gordon I think, this is a tough one."
Aaron gordon
"Lol, I feel you. Kawhi? He’s barely played in years. Jokic is easily better than half those guys.. Dude gets no respect at all in this sub. If he lost in the first round of the playoffs with his current crappy supporting cast, this sub would basically just never consider him whatsoever. His only really good teammate now is Aaron Gordon…"
"I man Aaron Gordon guarded the other teams star wing ayers.  He guarded Harden. LeBron, Luka, KD, Tatum etc.  Isaac guarded bigs like Giannis, Porzingis.  Go back and watch the games bro.  Isaac never guarded the wings.  That was all Aaron Gordon. It's why he was the on ball stopper and Isaac was the rim protector."
"Aaron Gordon is not, in fact, too f\*\*ing little."
Now tell me would you trade Jamal Murray for Ben Simmons? Would you trade Aaron Gordon for Tobias Harris? How about Danny Green for MPJ?
He played a bit like Aaron Gordon actually. I wouldn't say GTJ has outdone him just yet but he's definitely on the right path.
"&gt;If you use last season too, KD definitely wouldn’t have an argument. The gap was larger last year.  Objectively incorrect. Keep in mind we’re talking about their scoring specifically.  KD last season - 26.9 ppg on 66.6 TS%  Jokic - 26.4 ppg on 64.7 TS%  &gt;Yes, Jokic’s positional advantage matters more than 30ppg. That’s why Jokic at 19ppg was more impactful than Bradley Beal at 30. I don’t think you understand the concept of replacement value.  Objectively incorrect. Jokic was roughly a similar caliber player as Beal that season, and that’s largely due to his passing closing the large gap in scoring.  &gt;Yeah, Denver has so many elite defensive players around jokic. Name 2?  Aaron Gordon and PJ Dozier."
"The nuggets are considered stacked? Because Murray isn't seen as a defensive player. Prior to Aaron Gordon they had an aged Paul Millsap. Gary Harris was a solid 2 for defense, but Barton isn't. KAT has had guys specifically tailored for defensive roles alongside him, but they turn in shitty defense year after year."
"As a Heat fan, I’ve seen good defense. Lol, sorry that was douchey, but having seen almost all the Nugs games this year, Jokic has been awesome. You don’t get that record with Aaron Gordon as your second best player if your best player isn’t absolutely amazing. He’s been really good defensively. Most of defense is just positioning and hustle anyways and he’s incredibly smart."
"I went once to watch a friend's high school team play. I knew a few of the guys on the team, all strong, tall, scary big and towered over me etc. And I got to watch every single one of them get absolutely posterized by sophomore Aaron Gordon while they were seniors. The difference of an NBA caliber player is so crazy when seen at lower levels"
"Also right, but they have gotten even smaller. Aaron Gordon is a pure 4 in today’s game, that’s a big difference even compared to the late 00s."
We will have to wait until there aren't two max contracts riding the pine before we declare that Denver doesn't have a championship roster.   That stretch after the Aaron Gordon trade and before the Murray injury was ridiculous. I think they would have been title favorites last year had Murray not gone down...
"Tobias Harris, Evan Fournier, Vuc, Aaron Gordon and Elf all started together for like three years"

"Right, cause we do this shit every year..   No, our squad has fully bought in due to Malone. Jokers defending is the best I’ve ever seen it. Like actually an above average defender to start the year. Barton has been absolutely stellar and Aaron Gordon may be the most complete defender in the entire association right now. Nobody seems to notice since literally nobody goes out of their way to watch the Nuggets if their team isn’t playing. I’m"
Honestly to me Jokic is the most impressive out of all of them right now. Without Jamal Murray he basically has to pray that Will Barton or Aaron Gordon have a good game. Barton’s been very good so far but he was awful tonight.   Steph and KD have way more help.
Aaron Gordon is the MVP of this game if Jokic didn't exist
Aaron Gordon is playing DPOY level this year. Sooo underrated and undermentioned.
I love Aaron Gordon
Eh Aaron Gordon put the clamps on Luka in the Nuggets Mavs game this year. Big reason we held them to 75 was Luka being uncomfortable all night with AG all up in his shit and no one else being able to create their own shot while he was struggling.
"Nuggets are playing some insane team defense this year so far, Jokic has been a big part of it. But also Aaron Gordon has been amazing (imo) doing everything we have needed him to do. I think we’re going to be really scary when MPJ and Jamal are back to full health."
"Aaron Gordon deserves a mention here, also a high flyer who plays lock down defense on some of the leagues best players"
I like their chances against most teams but don't see how they beat a healthy Nuggets team with Murray.  No one on the Clippers can handle a big like Jokic and Aaron Gordon plays really good D on the other team's best guard.  I also don't see how they get past the Suns.
Supposedly Aaron Gordon was the better deal at 4/80 than LaVine...
Aaron Gordon would be my pick for DPOY. Guy defends everyone and their mommas.
"He was electric. Like Jordan. It’s like watching curry. There’s an element of the creative unexpected that, if you love basketball, is very exhilarating.   Like, imagine watching Aaron Gordon. Tons of athleticism. Maybe the odd athletic move. But not really popping off your screen. Even Duncan didn’t have it.   This type of magic that anything could happen.  I don’t know how else to describe it"
Can any nuggets fan tell me how y'all have the 2nd best defense in the NBA? Did Aaron Gordon turn your defensive culture around?
"I mean, with the level of competition since Aaron Gordon and Zach Levine stopped doing it, I feel like he could still do ok. He threw down a reverse alley oop in an actual game last night. He probably wouldn't win, but he wouldn't make a fool of himself either."
"Daryl ego.. what? Lol fuck off, he wont accept marcus smart and rober willians for simmons, they couldnt even get aaron gordon with this package"

Aaron Gordon could never
Aaron Gordon still lost haha
"It's probably a big piece, but keep in mind we have Aaron Gordon now where most of last year we didn't. An entire offseason with him to prep and play with our defense has really worked wonders."
"Ah gotcha, total RAPTOR has Mikal Bridges at 2 though and Rose at 3. Surprised to see Devonte Graham, Aaron Gordon and Whiteside in the top 10."
Reminds me of that whole Aaron Gordon whiteboard situation
"They tried to move him at the same time as Aaron Gordon, Evan Fournier, and Vuc but couldn't find any takers. It's more a matter of time than anything else."
"I don't see how that could be true considering that your table lists Aaron Gordon as having the highest +/- on the Nuggets, implying that Gordon &amp; Campazzo have a bigger swing than Jokic and Campazzo."
He outlasted Aaron Gordon
"I've been open to trading either of Turner or Sabonis for ages - the issue is though that if we traded either, we'd be looking for a defensive-minded stretch-4 back and those players are about as rare as someone with Turner's skillset. We got close apparently with the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T.  Here's a list of forwards I'd think be a great fit next to Sabonis - pretty much none of them are available:  Johnathan Issac, Marcus Morris, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith, Aaron Gordon, Robert Covington  PJ Washington is about the only player I could see a realistic trade for.  We'd have to be high on PJ (I am, I don't know if many others are). For what it's worth, Miles Bridges erupting to start the season has made him more expendable. Apparently Charlotte's tried a few times to offer PJ and a 1st for Turner and I think that's a realistic return.  I'd also like Harrison Barnes, but he's on a hot-streak right now."

"In terms of build, not athletic profile - Aaron Gordon, Karl Malone, maybe Bam?"
Aaron Gordon for me.
"Karl Malone, Isaiah ""Beef Stew"" Stewart, Aaron Gordon, Corey Maggette or Blake Griffin"
Aaron gordon
Christian Wood got big in Detroit?   How about the Orlando Magic?   Shaq   Dwight   Oladipo    Aaron Gordon   Nikola Vucevic   Evan Fournier
"That's a good point lol. If anything I feel like centre defence is the least important. It has a huge impact when you have someone like Gobert that makes teams drive the ball a whole lot less and can change shot selection dramatically, but wing defenders who can lower 3p's and guard the point guard are far more valuable imo.  Honestly our team has gotten so much better since we got Aaron Gordon. I watched him a little in Orlando but never enough to realise what a beastly defender he is."
He was doing similar unnecessary shit with Aaron Gordon a few years ago
It’s been 10 games lmfao. Remember when Aaron Gordon said people better not sleep on the Magic 10 games in?
It’s wild how quick it happened. Then on the flip side there’s guys like Brandon Ingram and Aaron Gordon who simply have been early 20s for decades now
Banchero can probably be the guy Aaron Gordon was supposed to be. probably even better tbh.    Jabari Smith hype is warranted (as a biased Auburn fan) he moves crazy well for a 6’11 PF. Big Mobley vibes but slightly less polished.    Pat Baldwin is smooth as hell. Tatum-like.    JD Davidson’s shooting and defense is a concern but he’s an athlete for the ages.
underrated aspect: Lowry and Aaron Gordon beef too
Overrated? Lowry gets shit on his entire career. The praise is a response to the hate from casual fans that just watch box scores and parade in after he has an off night. Talk to any NBA player outside of Aaron Gordon and they all know what he brings to a team. One regular season game with a new team doesn't prove anything. He literally put up a 20pt triple double the other night vs the Jazz
Aaron gordon
"""You can't elbow that guy, he's the MVP. Aaron Gordon has zero all star selections. *Him* you can elbow"""
[“All bark no bite”](https://youtu.be/wRX0rEIUptc) people acting like he was waiting for Joker to walk away when he was mad at whoever was in that scuffle he was also in near centre court with the staff and Aaron Gordon
"Nah it was somebody else in that group, probably Aaron Gordon. He didn't even know what happened until he saw the replay."
He is talking to the Denver staff guy who he pushed and whom Aaron Gordon was holding back
And Monte Morris and Aaron Gordon will average 20 each and Denver will lose 90-120 every night
"Stupid hard foul but baby jokic what is you doing big dawg? Mpj hurt and your team needs you man, he’s probably suspended for 5+ games leaving Aaron Gordon and Monte Morris to lead this team"
Aaron Gordon: 😎
"Aaron Gordon is still a Magic at heart, look at how he’s fucking the Heat"
I have a feeling this nuggets team is either gonna get demolished or we’re gonna make the heat look like shit. Are we gonna see Aaron Gordon on Tyler hero tonight at some point lol
So they pass on Aaron Gordon last year (get fournier instead which still infuriates me that they felt he would contribute at a high level) and now they look to get simmons WITH brown rumored in the talks. Man Danny really did not know what he was doing here and brads following his footsteps if this happens.
Current: Mo Bamba  Former: Aaron Gordon
"not that far back, more like 2/3 years  ago when they had Vucevic/Mo Bamba/Jonathan Isaac/Aaron Gordon all playing significant minutes"
"I simply don’t have the energy to have an extended discussion about why it’s wrong to dismiss MPJ right now when it’s his first big stint with back issues since he first started playing for us a couple years ago. There has been more than enough fruitful discussion about why the contract was justified in the eyes of the Nuggets  Also, Gary Harris hasn’t been on the Nuggets since February since he was traded for Aaron Gordon. Gary Harris is in Orlando."
Holy shit yes. The prospect Aaron Gordon could have been
Okay I got it: A better Aaron Gordon.
Miles Bridges is who Aaron Gordon thinks he is
I think Aaron Gordon settled it
"Lol but you neglect the rest of the starting five. MPJ is really good and Aaron Gordon is certainly better than anyone on that Nets starting five, at least the way he played last years playoffs. Same thing with Facu but on a lower level."
Kyle Lowry and Aaron Gordon have beef going back to the bubble.
"I’m sure someone else has probably mentioned this, but I randomly decided to check the box score on ESPN and saw: Eric Gordon vs. Aaron Gordon, Porter Jr. vs. Porter Jr., and THREE J. GREENS lmao!!!"
Probably a mid/late first rounder at the trade deadline. Might be able to swing an Aaron Gordon level return if the Celtics are willing to take back an overpay contract.
At 5:20 aaron gordon makes one hell of a nice assist
"Aaron ""overpaid"" Gordon"
"clutch final 2 minutes by the nuggets, Aaron Gordon making some huge 3’s.  Nikola Jokic is a animal"
Only if AAron Gordon is the greatest 3pt shooter of all time
Who would’ve thought Aaron Gordon would bail us out with back-to-back 3’s.
please aaron gordon let me fucking marry you
Fucking Aaron Gordon.. Ofc dude turns into Curry last 1 minute of the game lmao  Fade me
"Aaron Gordon with the clutch shots and Jokic with the clutch block, just like we all expected"
"Aaron Gordon? Tobias Harris? Idk, just need a decent upgrade at the 4"
"It's real easy for fans to rip a guy when he's down but being bigger doesn't make someone any more injury resistant, I don't get that mentality.   How many high usage post players make it through a season unscathed. Who's AD's direct big man comparison/competition? Embiid and Joker?   Embiid is as injury prone as AD.  Joker plays a much less athletic style of basketball and doesn't even have the most paint touches on his team (Aaron gordon)"
"If you follow some nba players on twitch, you will be surprised how less impact they have.  Most get around 100 viewers. Seth Curry was streaming like for 30 viewers. Aaron Gordon got for sponsored streams with other streamers like 500 viewers.  Only Dev Booker had over 1k viewers, but also because he played consistently with other popular streamers/content creators."
Why does aaron gordon gets so few FG attempt even when performing good?
Aaron Gordon😂
I didn’t say he was but he’s shown more potential to be.  Off the dribble three point shooting.  Pick and roll shooting.  Getting the the rim and getting to the line.  His passing needs to improve but he has more to work with than Isaac offensively.  Isaac still has an ugly jumper that doesn’t go in much.  And he’s a hard driver but it never amounted to much.  Sure he had to cover for Vuc on defense but also he was the odd one out always in the closing lineup because of his offensive faults.  Aaron Gordon with all of his problems is a better offensive player than Isaac.
"I said for an impact player, not a superstar. Comparative to like Mikal Bridges and Aaron Gordon for example, OG is making substantially less and outperforming them on the floor."

"I know “moving goalposts” is the thing all the cool kids say, but it does actually mean something. You don’t get to just make up what you think I said in your own head and claim that when you start actually reading properly.  I’ve watched both of those teams a couple times this year, they’re fun. The Kings in particular have been my West team for a few years, Fox and Buddy are two of my favourite players to watch. What they aren’t, is good. The chances of either of them doing anything in the playoffs are close to zero. That’s not competitive. Doesn’t mean they’re equally as terrible as SGA and G-Leaguers or whatever the Rockets are doing, but no team with title aspirations is worried about the Cavs or Kings.  Go back in time and check out the 2017 Magic. Started the season 6-2. Beat the Heat, blew out the LeBron Cavs, beat the Nets, blew out the Spurs, easy win against the Pelicans, close win against the Grizzlies. They looked great, Aaron Gordon turned a corner, their defence was unbelievable, Vucci was a star, it was all gravy.  They finished 25-57. Seven games of a season means fuck all, even when you beat a couple of good teams."
"I'm familiar with that, happens with Giannis all the time. It's amazing how ""Giannis stoppers"" turn out to be mediocre defenders when he torches them.   Turner, Thaddeus Young, Aaron Gordon, Simmons, Ayton etc. have moved from the ""Giannis stopper"" group to the ""can't guard Giannis 1v1, needed hmore help"" group overnight.  People were saying Ayton is the best Giannis stopper before and during the finals. Then the narrative changed, they were saying the Suns didn't help Ayton by doubling Giannis and Giannis is lucky they let him score 50, bad coaching by Monty etc.  Fuck the haters. Dame was a BEAST vs the Nuggets, one of the best playoffs performances I've ever seen."
"I remember Aaron Gordon dunking in those. If that was the first year then yeah. City edition jerseys are new for teams that aren't Lakers, Celtics, Knicks and Bulls."
"Jokic, Jamal, MPJ, Aaron Gordon and bones hyland"
Aaron Gordon demanded a trade to a competitive team and Wood is better imo
"His draft class kinda sucked. Imagine looking at a top 5 draft that included Dante Exum, Aaron Gordon, and Jabari Parker…  Wiggins was hyped up because he was sooo much better than those dudes (excluding Joel)."
Joseph “Aaron” Gordon Zack Levine?
"Ah yes, PJ Tucker and Aaron Gordon have the same roles.  Just as Steph Curry and CJ McCollum have the same role, to score a basket.   Quality analysis"
Aaron Gordon should be all defense this year.
&gt; Not it’s not. AG can dunk on just about everyone in the league  Aaron Gordon cannot consistently dunk through a contest lol. In the playoffs he was blocked or sent to the line (wouldn't be an issue if he weren't such a terrible FT shooter) on dunk attempts the vast majority of players would make
Aaron Gordon to Lakers!
At quick glance I read Aaron Gordon and Josh Okogie's names and immediately thought the rest was going to be a trade
"I really wanna see Randle make an all star appearance. I was a big fan of the very hyped 2014 Draft where the 5 biggest names were Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Embiid, Aaron Gordon, and Julius Randle and outside of Embiid all of those guys have underwhelmed to some extent for what we thought they would be. Randle is playing like the guy I thought the Lakers drafted in 2014 and I hope he keeps it up"
"Zach Levine, Booker, Lonzo, Aaron Gordon and Rudy Gobert."
"Idk what your saying, their development's been great, developing Aaron Gordon to a solid scoring option but he's **injury-prone**, Isaac was a DPOY caliber player before the **injury**, and Markelle started going off before **injury.** They've just been getting fucked and they were always low in the lottery because they were a playoff team, they even made Vucevic a one-time allstar. Last player I remember leaving them and getting better was oladipo, but he attributed that to getting inspired by russ more than anything so it isn't really there fault."
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"Don’t worry, Aaron Gordon is going prime Curry again.   Randle, Griffin and Gordon are a combined 18/29 from 3 against us. We’re getting every mediocre 3 point shooting PF going straight automatic"
Cavs down 6 players(?)  Orlando down 5 players  Gonna be a scrappy game if we don’t get the steph curry version of Aaron Gordon.
Aaron Gordon looks like the same Aaron Gordon as every other year bro  Talented but frustratingly inconsistent
"Protected: Nikola Vucevic, Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac  Best Available: Evan Fournier, Khem Birch, Michael Carter Williams"

Oh certainly just look at our forward rotation.  Aaron Gordon is the only competent one on the roster.  If we can get a better SF and maybe a stretch 4 off the bench preferably not Dwayne Bacon and Gary Clarke we’d be better off.
1. Voooooch  2. Jonathan issac   3. Markelle fultz   4. Coke Anthony   5. Chuma okeke   6. Aaron Gordon   7. Terrance Ross
"&gt; I can see flipping dray for like Aaron Gordon or John Collins  Total junk. Dray isn't gonna get traded untiil the final year of this contract, at best."
"Dray aint gone age well.   On offense he’s already at an athletic deficit (never a threat to finish at the basket on the 4 on 3).  On defense he’s still getting to spots hella early and his second jump is hella quick.   What he does with the ball in his hands is nice, but it’s less valuable when there are actually good players on the team.  I can see flipping dray for like Aaron Gordon or John Collins when klay and whatever wing we get with minny’s pick get here.   That’ll still give us a chance to win now while extending our run, because curry and klay are probably gonna age great. (Nash &amp; ray alllen)"
People say Aaron Gordon every year and nothing happens lol but the real one we might trade is Evan Fournier since he’s expiring
Aaron Gordon
"That's still a really undersized rotation. I feel like one of those bench pieces should be flipped to add more size.. if you were to replace Teague with someone like Aaron Gordon, sending Smart to the bench, that's way better. That's not to say deal Teague away, rather a pick with Carsen Edwards and Theis + part of the trade exception if need be. I'd also welcome a true 7 foot or near 7 foot big back for added depth in this scenario, because Theis is important for that. Boston still gets destroyed by good true centers."

"The best at post play has to be Russ especially last season. Hes just way too strong for guards thats why teams have bigger players guard him whether its AD, Aaron Gordon, Giannis, or Simmons."
"For us , tanking would just be keeping the roster as-is and continuing to lose games.  As in, not making any panic moves at the trade deadline like trading a bunch of stuff for Aaron Gordon, for example   And hey, if it means you guys get a great pick then whatever, sunk cost and all that .  Worst thing imo would be to double down and continue trading away our draft picks"
Was Shaq hacked by Aaron Gordon? This post seems to confirm it
Gotta be liberal with who you put at Power Forward on that team but yeah that combination. Plus Christian Wood and Aaron Gordon my gawd lmao
"I'd make a trade of LeVert, Prince and a 2nd to the Magic for Aaron Gordon and Khem Birch. Try to trade Dinwiddie first instead of LeVert even though Dinwiddie is a better fit with higher IQ it sucks he's injured, but if not LeVert. Then DeAndre is gone for literally anything we'd even pay picks for team to take him free. Actually play Bruce Brown at PG, call back Claxton from reserve purgatory and tell Nash to draw some plays for once"
Lmao Air Gordon is way more suitable for Aaron Gordon than Eric Gordon. Never ever heard anyone call Eric that
"True, but I think the circumstances were different. Majority, if not all of the minutes from that game came when he was playing the de facto 5 because of the absence of Al Horford, and he was able to play more inside game besides some spot up 3s. With him being really the only inside presence, I think the system helped his case a lot, but of course he had to execute himself, which he did. Throwing him in against the team that doesn’t have a pure 4 would be a difficult match up for him, as he doesn’t really have the quickness guard the likes of Aaron Gordon and feast in the paint like he did with another center on the floor"
 Exception for aaron gordon we will be fine
Has aaron Gordon peaked? 9/10 lol
"Delon Wright, Jeff Green, Aaron Gordon"
"Trade for Harden probably.   But they need to use that TPE and get some nice complimentary pieces; a lot of players from the Magic could work (i.e. Gordon, Fournier, Ross) or even Harrison Barnes.   The bench is too raw but they need at least one of those guys between Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford to break out. None are great shooters at the moment.  They'll probably continue to be a perennial second round exit though until Tatum/Brown become the next Jordan/Pippen."
"They have mismatched personnel.  Theis, Williams, and TT can really only play C.  They need to move one of them  Prichard has started off strong.  If Kemba comes back and can play 25-30 minutes then I don’t see how they play all of Teague, Kemba and Pritchard either.    They either need a stretch 4 to push Jaylen to a 2 or they need a 2 who can murder from downtown.   Langford and Nesmith are complete unknowns but both could quickly solve two of Boston’s biggest problems: bench scoring and floor spacing for Tatum/Brown   I would have assumed Boston would be showcasing Nesmith for a trade, but he must be real bad in practice if he’s not getting any play.   The most obvious trade is for Aaron Gordon.  If they could get Gordon and Fournier (no idea if that’s even possible with cap/TPE.  I think they would have to do two separate trades to make it work"
"I like our team now. We just really miss Kemba right now. And I hope we use our TPE on someone like Aaron Gordon to help Tatum and Brown on the wing. Could not disagree more with people on here saying trade Tatum and brown.   Maybe by mid season if we aren’t in a solid place then I may be saying something different, but most teams seem inconsistent right now."
"Trade Tatum for a current top player, maybe like Lillard. Then trade Brown and Kemba and picks for Harden.    Use the TPE on Aaron Gordon   Run it back with Lillard/Smart/Harden/Gordon/Thompson    Obviously they won't do it because GMs are pussies though. If they truly wanted to win a ring they could but it would involve massive risk."
"I read this as ""which player under the age of 23 could the Wolves get to play NEXT to KAT"". If that was the case I'd suggest Aaron Gordon; he's over 23 but he'd be perfect as your guy who can guard wings and play around the rim.  Off note, the Clippers would like to offer you one slightly-used Marcus Morris for Ricky Rubio."
~4 years ago I thought Aaron Gordon would be a borderline all-star by now
I’m so tired of Aaron Gordon lol he should be so much better somehow he’s gotten worse
If he hits corner 3’s well he’ll be a bit better but that’s it.  I think if he was out there bricking a bunch  of 3 point attempts like Aaron Gordon he would be worse
"Here's the tweet telling the whole ""story"" in the article. Just to save you a click.  &gt;Reporter: Talk about that 3 you hit Simmons: Talk about? Shit, what you want me to say? Fuck..Yo, I came down, Aaron Gordon went under, Joel threw it to me in the corner and I let it go...I don't have a long answer for you.""  &gt;(they were joking around with each other)"
Wait is Aaron Gordon still injured from the bubble play with Lowry on the dunk?
Gordon? Aaron? He is average nba player at best.
Dallas was widely rumored to be interested in Mo Bamba so maybe Trae would've been available to us at 6.  But yeah an Orlando Magic pick in the future would've been more enticing than Dallas picks.  Like if we said to ATL pick 6 and a future unprotected pick plus Aaron Gordon or Vuc in exchange for Luka I don't see how Dallas beats that.
"I need Aaron Gordon to score 15 for a bet, starting to feel like I’m beat"
Aaron Gordon is literally Omar’s boy from season 1
"Dwight vs Aaron Gordon, the legends of Magic"
"Cause this dudes whole career on offense has been him wanting to do the shit he's bad at and avoiding the shit he's good at lmao. I'm seriously confused how someone who says they've watched him would ever call him a ""high iq offensive swiss army knife who knows his role"".   It's like you typed that sentence specifically for it to be the opposite of Aaron Gordon"
Nope. Aaron Gordon isn't as good defensively but is a high iq offensive Swiss army knife who knows his role and executes it very well. He also has size. I'd say it's slightly lower
Probably Aaron Gordon
Umm hello they’re not the only ones. The Clippers just got Rondo which he fills multiple needs for them. The bucks just got PJ Tucker. The Sixers just got George Hill and Denver just got Aaron Gordon and Javale McGee who both basically replace what they lost in Jeremi Grant
"Honestly if the Pacers FO decided to get away from running 2 bigs on the floor I think that's a decent return.   I've always been fine with listening to Turner offers but we'd need a defensive-minded stretch-4 back. Aaron Gordon or PJ Washington fit that bill well.  That being said, our defense would absolutely crater since neither of those guys I mentioned could protect the rim."
"Fun fact: my buddy turned away Aaron Gordon from a house party our freshman year, and he was not pleased. He came back inside and said “this tall guy named Aaron asked if he and his friends could come in. They didn’t bring any girls or drinks so I turned him away.”  Not the same as Steph Curry now, but Gordon was definitely well known around the Arizona campus."
Huh????? That Zach Lavigne vs Aaron Gordon dunk contest was one of the greatest of all time. I suggest you rewatch it.
Aaron Gordon does
"&gt; Everyone would (still) like to remind Aaron Gordon that they don't give a shit.  Seriously though, he probably did win the first one against Zach LaVine; it was close, but I suppose you *could* say he was robbed. But he most certainly was not robbed in the second one against Derrick Jones Jr."
"Yeahh, I agree, we'll see come playoff time if Kawhi can turn it up a notch. I look up the stats on Aaron Gordon thankss"
"Kawhi can be, it’s hard to say how serious he takes regular season   Aaron Gordon has some very top 1v1 stats this year."
"Aaron ""afro"" Gordon"
"When Aaron Gordon got robbed the second time, Ja tweeted something about how that made his decision to not do the Dunk Contest so much easier.  So blame Dwyane Wade."
I wish he could be our Aaron Gordon instead of our MPJ.
"Before they traded for aaron gordon, I thought some Harris+Millsap+FRP trade might work."
"He said he doesn't want to be in it since Aaron Gordon was robbed last year, he also called out the scoring this year for the Cassius Stanley dunk."
Shoulda traded for Aaron Gordon honestly
Jokic Zeke naji / or milsap  Aaron gordon  MPJ Javal McGee
Na I didn’t even go to Mitty LOL I just thought it was cool a school I recognize is being brought up here  For aaron Gordon there is a benefit tho p sure those prep schools are better for sports  For the average kid there’s no benefit
"Big market teams absolutely get waaayyyy more leeway than small market teams. The Nuggets are probably one of the best run franchises, we didn't make bad personnel decsions, we are the top of the second tier of contenders, and we had absolutely zero chance at any of these free agents.   u/MixMastaPJ put it very well higher up in the thread:  &gt; And imagine if you didn't have to send them away to get rid of awful contracts like Deng and Mozgov.

What's the fucking point anymore? &gt;  &gt; It takes GSW losing two superstars to serious injuries in the finals for non-destination market (that acquired disgruntled Kawhi from a small market) to win the title. After that, you have the 2011 Mavs and the 2004 Pistons shocking the world, and the rest have a ton of help (via discounts, fleeced trades of players forcing their way out, superteaming up, etc)"
"I want to know who wrote the Nuggets blurb and called Aaron Gordon a ""star player"" lol"

Aaron Gordon &gt; Jeremiah Grant
"Well, Aaron Gordon does have the most perfect 50 dunks in NBA history"
"Not true. We have been pretty good at getting players better, we aren't good at retaining them once they are good. Every player we traded on the deadline turned into a better player in Orlando. Gordon's problem is Aaron Gordon. You can take one look at one of his music videos and you can see his enemy is ego. He had every opportunity to turn into Kobe Bryant if he wanted to here, he was just inconsistent and took bad shots."
"This is much ado about nothing.  The buyout market favors GOOD contending teams.  It has no extra incentive for players to go to big markets than they normally would as free agents.  The small-market execs might as well be complaining about how their smaller city doesn't offer the same kind of nightlife and business opportunities as LA, NY, or Chicago.  This is the typical small market whining spun to make it seem like a new argument when its not.    Beck's writeup takes liberties with what is considered a big market because it doesn't help his argument.  He begins that paragraph with ""Other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week."" as if switching the focus to ""other contenders"" isn't supposed to support the main point that small markets are being hurt.  The word ""small"" appears 10 times in his article, and is ALWAYS referencing the size of the market.  The word ""contender/contending"" appears 6 times, with 5 of those times directly used as a synonym for ""big market"" teams instead of simply a stand-in for ""good"" teams.  Its a bait-and-switch, he's throwing in ""contender/contending"" to make it seem like the complaints are about contending teams as well when its in fact all about big markets.    And of the teams he listed like the Nuggets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, and Heat, 2 of them laughably not big markets, but they're in his list because it helps to prove his point AFTER he's got the reader already hooked on his point of view that big = contender.  Denver is a middling sized city (13th in city size, 16th in metro size) and the Bucks are 20th and 24th in city/metro.  They should not be lumped together with the other teams.  In fact, a more fair article would have them on *opposing* sides.  The paragraph should instead read:  &gt; ""Though other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week, not all were big markets.  The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  The Sixers traded players and picks to get George Hill. The Heat traded players and draft considerations to get Victor Oladipo.  *However*, the Nuggets traded players and draft picks to get Aaron Gordon and the Bucks traded players and picks to get P.J. Tucker.""  This rewrite of his paragraph gives at least a cursory opposition view that not all big markets are benefiting, its the good teams, and that's by design and nobody's fault and not a problem.  But writing an article saying ""Nothing is wrong, everything is just fine"" doesn't draw clicks.  You know what would draw clicks though but probably get Beck blacklisted by half the NBA teams?  Writing about the real problem, which is that cheap/bad owners drive players away and destroy competitiveness.  If you want to talk about big vs. small market teams, why not bring up the fact that the Knicks haven't exactly been a robust destination in the buyout market cause they've sucked for 20 years?  How about part of this competitive balance being destroyed by a big market team in Houston?  Frittata got rid of anyone who mattered in Houston and drove away his best player because he's cheap and wouldn't pay guys.  Want more?  Paul George said himself that he recruited AD to Indiana but the Pacers owner didn't want to pay him, citing they're a small market.  You know what's not small about Herb Simon?  His $2.6 billion net worth.  You know who's considered a pauper by NBA owner standards?  Jeanie Buss, owner of the Lakers and valued at a mere $500 million.  In fact, the trust that her father set up splits the ownership between all 6 kids, so even though she's technically the owner, she owns only 1/6th of the Lakers not counting the AEG partial ownership, which is 27%.  So technically, she only owns 11% of the 66% percent the Buss siblings own.  Yet she'll spend money like its going out of style to make sure the Lakers are relevant.    If there is a problem with buyouts, then it is NOT a fight between big and small markets.  Its a fight between good and bad teams AS IT SHOULD BE, and a fight between owners willing to spend and owners not willing to spend AS IT SHOULD BE.  The unnamed small-market execs quoted in the article would do a lot better to bring their complaints up to their owners and tell them to open their wallets if they want talent.  Or these GMs should tell their owners to fire them and hire better GMs.  They won't do that though, and therein lies the real reason why this article was written."
"You realize I didn't say anything about Aaron Gordon right? No one is going out of their way to say anything because there's **FOUR** threads about him on the front page of /r/nba right now. Magic fans are participating in discussion just as much as you are. He just didn't really have that crazy of a game yet everyone is talking about him like he just had a career night or something. I hope AG succeeds in Denver and so do most Magic fans, but why should that mean none of us are allowed to talk about him ever again?"
Aaron Gordon Ramsey
Aaron Gordon last night had 0 trouble meshing and seemed like he had been playing with the Nuggets for years.  We are going to look real spicy soon.
Aaron Gordon is a pretty British name tbf.
Aaron Gordon fit in seamlessly with the starting lineup. The athleticism and energy he brings to the team will be huge moving forward.
Mfs traded for Aaron Gordon when they had Bol Bol the entire time lmao wtf

Aaron Gordon is so underrated. Wish my Magic could’ve turned him into a star like the Nuggets will.
"You know that moment in The Shawshank Redemption where Andy, after spending several years being exploited in an abusive prison, has just escaped a fetid sewer and is gloriously breathing in free air for the first time?   Aaron Gordon does."
bro we have Aaron Gordon now
"Everyone’s saying stuff like “oh bulls won the trade deadline! The clippers won the trade deadline”, nah Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo won the trade deadline."
"Orlando really not the ideal place for development, all they developed was Vucevic, I mean look at Aaron Gordon"
"""Aaron Gordon got robbed"" - the last thing I will tell everyone when I'm on the deathbed."
Aaron Gordon has made the Nugs a contender.
I remember watching the Toronto versus Orlando Series in the 2019 playoffs. And there were moments where I felt like Aaron Gordon was the second best player in the series.
How does Jokic feel playing 2nd fiddle to Aaron Gordon?
Aaron Gordon is pretty close to the age Buddy was when he was drafted lol. I don't think enough is said about buddy aging two years in a single day
Aaron Gordon even tho he's better from 3 point land
"At the time Jerami Grant leaving felt like a true systemic shock that hurt this season and the future. And now it feels like the best thing that could’ve happened because Aaron Gordon is what people that didn’t watch the Nuggets thought Grant was, a top notch defender."
I'm so happy for Aaron Gordon!
Nuggets are a top 4 team especially with the new addition of Aaron Gordon. Jokic is easily getting the mvp this year. Any scmuck who picks that lard ass harden who was a piece of shit for the rockets to begin the season. That part still counts and is one of the many reasons why harden will not win the mvp this year
"Jamaal Murray, MPJ, Aaron Gordon, Jokic, and Will Barton   Outside of the Brooklyn Nets MPJ/Gordon/Barton might be the best 3-5 in the league, tbh.  Barton is criminally underrated just because he's been in Denver for so long but he understands their system like the back of his hand.   MPJ is just absolutely DISGUSTING and AG is about to blow up."
"You saw the Aaron Gordon clip too, huh?"
Aaron Gordon is the only player in NBA history
"Nuggets have Jamal Murray, MPJ and now Aaron Gordon along with some other nice role players. They would most likely crush this current Lakers team."
Hey man can someone link the comments in the trade thread 4 days ago when everyone said Gary harris rj Hampton and a late first was either even or too much for Aaron Gordon...
"People in this thread forgetting they lost Gary Harris AND Jerami Grant... Aaron Gordon can't replace both of them right? Yeah maybe Gordon is a better defender than Harris but losing Grant is huge too, Harris/Grant defended PG/Kawhi and now you're gonna have to pick only one of them to put Gordon on   I think this matchup could really go either way, people are underrating the Clips a bit and also underrating how much the loss of Grant AND Harris is gonna matter come playoff time"
RJ has a lot of potential. I think he's basically the guard version of Aaron Gordon ironically. He'll develop into a really good player.
"Aaron Gordon is gonna have Andre Iguodalas career arc all over again. Never quite becomes the first option people want, moves away from the team that drafts him to become a key role player for contenders and people start to appreciate how good he is"
"I apologize in advanced if this comment seems mean-spirited.  The fact that Aaron Gordon cares THIS much about losing the dunk contest is laughable. Are you serious dude? It's the fucking dunk contest! Nobody cares who wins, we just wanna see cool dunks.  Aaron Gordon should channel some of that energy into becoming a better."
Thoughts from someone who has now watched 2 whole Denver Nuggets games this season:   Aaron Gordon looked like he fit in seamlessly with the team. Made a lot of good decisions on offense.   Will Barton looked...not great. He seems like he's just trying to move way too fast all the time. He fumbled the ball quite a bit and didn't make great decisions offensively.   Jokic looked like the clear best player on the court and it wasn't even close. Incredible player.   Hawks were a mess. Trae Young did not look great.
"gary harris was so bad for us for so long, the extra defense he brought was great but the dude bricked soooo many wide open 3's, couldn't slash like he used to, and straight up became an offensive liability. The spacing overall tonight looked incredible, aaron gordon is essentially just 3x better at what Harris does since we don't really have a rim protector right now, he's better at slashing, shooting, defending, and passing. Nuggets absolutely fleeced the magic and I cannot believe we got him for so cheap, especially since gary harris would've required a 1st to dump in the future"
Aaron Gordon is the perfect puzzle piece to Jokic and his attitude is amazing.  Thank you Orlando!
"Watching Aaron Gordon play, you’d be forgiven for thinking he’s been on this team for years, he fit in so well"
Such an exciting game to watch after the Aaron Gordon trade
Aaron Gordon is exactly what we needed. Didn't see JaVale unfortunately
Dwayne Wade literally just voted for Derrick Williams because they were teammates even though Aaron Gordon was way better
Look I think it’s hilarious [Aaron Gordon is still this salty about a dunk contest from 3 years ago](https://twitter.com/katywinge/status/1376314573066620928?s=21) but if this is what helps him to fit in with Denver go for it
"I know people have been overrating Aaron Gordon lately, but THIS is just taking it to a whole new level of delusion 😂"
Aaron Gordon watching this with a smile on his face
"I love Vince and he changed the dunk contest forever, but Aaron Gordon can literally do every single dunk the VC did in the contest. Vince was incredible and his in game dunks are legendary, but Aaron Gordon can definitely match anything he did in the contest."
aaron gordon is perfect for this team bruh
aaron gordon wearing that mask ?
Aaron T-Bone Gordon
Oh shit wait is Aaron Gordon playing?
Aaron Gordon
Who the fuck wanted an Aaron Gordon documentary
"With Jokic, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, MPJ and now Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee, the Nuggets are stacked. Murray would be the best guard on the floor in that series and Jokic the best big man. Stopping Jokic would be a hard task for the Clippers."
"Comparing Aldridge now to McGrady that season is so suspect. You have to know how dissimilar they are. He’s gonna feast on bench units. Even with just Harden out there &amp; Shamet/Harris, he’ll make 5 open midrange js a game. Even when guarded- He’ll shoot over Harrell Zubac TT Aaron Gordon Dray Bam PJ Tucker Kanter  Will he defend? Fuck no. Doesn’t matter, they don’t need him to. Stay out of foul trouble and make easy 15 foot jumpers while one or more stars rest BUT you’re still surrounded by at least 3 deadly shooters &amp; a great cutter/roll man. They’re gonna average 120 a game"
"I want to as well, but Jokic is that dude and has really put the team on his back, but the Nuggets have been really shaky all season long. Aaron Gordon could be a really insane shake-up though.. I'm as curious as anyone else to see what they look like with a high flyer like him."
Aaron Gordon is a pretty good Grant replacement Jokic is going to eat no matter what. Ibaka isn’t a Jokic stopper
"Tbf, Jokic is looking better this year and they have Aaron Gordon now.  I think Nuggets v Clippers will be a fire series."
"I think they were, just moved on quicker. I know the nuggets were rumored early, but Aaron Gordon was an easier get since Orlando actually was trying to trade him"
"&gt;If Evan Fournier Aaron Gordon Nikola Vucevic were so good why could they not win together?  Because only Vucevic was playing constantly in a high level.   Fournier is a good player, and would be excellent as a leader of the second unit, but only good as a starter.  Gordon, probably due to his injuries, never became the player that everyone expected.  And lastly, because the rest of the team (with some exceptions) was never very good."
"Gordon did make it internally, but he still acknowledged it publicly which still violates the CBA. “Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon acknowledged Tuesday that he has asked the organization for a trade and is hoping to be moved in advance of Thursday's trade deadline.”   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31124538/orlando-magic-aaron-gordon-says-frustration-fueled-request-traded?platform=amp"
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"
"You ever watch Vuc?  He's a beast.  I dont think anybody thinks Fournier is anything special.  He's a solid starting guard but no more than that.  Aaron gordon has a nice little skillset but nothing too special either.  These guys all together on the same team playing big minutes isnt a combination for winning though.  To win, you need a complete roster with complimentary players who can defend and run a good enough offense.  These 3 guys are good individually but together they aint doing shit."
"Aaron Gordon has a respectable jumper now too, if the threshold is just hitting a few shots a game at an average percentage"
Same reason why Aaron Gordon wasn’t fined for requesting a trade and Anthony Davis was.
"Jesus, you aren't even making any effort whatsoever to understand the points I'm making.    It requires an iota of nuanced thought to realize that bringing up a teams seed in the MVP case with 30 games left and the west as tight as it is is utterly silly.  Two months ago they were the 9 seed, they have one of the easiest schedules left in the league, and are super hot right now and just added Aaron Gordon.  It doesn't take much analysis to realize there is a very good chance they finish as a higher seed than they currently are. They've been trending up for months.  The Lakers are super hurt, it's almost inevitable we will pass them in the next week or two.    But you are making zero effort at all to actually use your brain and are just repeating ""dude seeding is super important.""  A useless debate, have a nice night dude."
aaron gordon a bucket tho
"...why? They literally beat the Jazz and Clippers last year. They are the only team amongst those that has actually made a deep playoff run with their roster.  Coming off a WCF, MPJ leveling up and now adding Aaron Gordon and Javale?  With the likely MVP?  Idk why it feels weird to put them on the 2nd tier, people are so weird about admitting the Nuggets are legit"
"They did though. The moves allowed them to have the cap space to sign two max contracts while keeping some role players that stars want to play with and then young players and picks to make trades with later.  Obviously Kyrie being a Nets fan helped and KD wanting to play here too, but if a dumber GM was here and maxed out Russell and traded for Aaron Gordon two years ago or something, there wouldn't be any room for the stars to come.  Marks inherited a team with no picks, was old, near the luxury tax, and sucked. It was a series of genius moves to get to where they are. The opportunity came up and they were prepared to take advantage."
"facts. cant just say they shoulda traded it without putting out potential packages they could trade for. maybe the dubs coulda done a better job shopping the pick, but i really cant think of anyone that they could legit be getting at the time other like aaron gordon maybe?  at the time, i dont remember anyone really saying any of the guys in the top 3 were cant miss prospects. its easy to say that bout lamelo now, but a lotta scouts seemed bearish on the guy. is anyone really giving up some big assets for choosing between wiseman and lamelo? eh, prob not"
"Denver would be essentially locking them into a core of Murray, Jokic and MPJ. Murray is looking like he'll be out next year and probably will take up most of the  2022-2023 season to get back up to what he was before. Meaning that the next 2 years (next year for sure) probably wont amount to a deep playoff run. And having to pay Aaron Gordon soon is going to be tough.   Obviously Denver has no choice in throwing money at him, but being a smaller market team that doesnt go over the cap would be a huge pill to swallow for the next 2 years. No doubt that MPJ can score but if I was the nuggets i would be stressing a little"
"dude wtf are you talking about? capela? *gobert?* How bout like, Ant, Lavine, Aaron Gordon, ya know? lol"
I would say the Nuggets would be intimidating. Jokic and Porter Jr are some big dudes. Aaron Gordon has some serious hops and it would certainly be a relief when you see Bol Bol isn’t a starter.
"Danny had way too many draft picks to use and didn't find a trade he liked so ended up using all of them. Every year we seem to replace productivr established talent with rookie contracts. It all came to a head this year where we lost Gordon Hayward, Brad Wanamaker, and Enes Kanter with Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. This season was always going to be hard with so much of the roster being made up of rookie contracts.    Look at all the other high seeds above above Boston and you see teams that added veterans. Milwaukee went out and got Holiday, Philly got Curry, Green and Dwight, Brooklyn sold the farm for Harden and filled out the roster with cheap veterans like Jeff Green.  The young players needed to get on the court and either show they're NBA level players or not so Ainge can finally make a decision on some of these guys. Pritchard broke out early and Timelord came on strong late."
"I agree, with Murray we had a good chance to make the finals, without him we're still a dark horse for it. Lakers are limping into the playoffs, Utah is down their best playoff player. Clippers and Suns are gonna be tough though, and Blazers and Mavs are both gnarly dark horses themselves.   Somebody is gonna need to step up for it though, Tall Klay has been making great strides, but it's gonna have to be a third person as well as the bench stepping way up for it to happen.  Aaron Gordon? Monte Morris? THE THRILL HIMSELF?? Time will tell."
You mean like Jonathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon.  Let's not pretend like we didn't pair him with 2 defensive minded bigs at the same time.
You think Aaron Gordon is going to suddenly become as good as Jaylen or Jayson? Why? MPJ might get there idk haven’t watched a lot of nuggets games but it seems unlikely Aaron Gordon is suddenly going to take a big leap.
"off the top: DA then Marcus Smart, Anunoby and Aaron Gordon"
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, Aaron Gordon"
after reading all of your posts i've determined that you're a gigantic homer and literally no intelligent GM would take Jokic over Embiid in the playoffs. Jokic had a negative net rating in the post-season despite getting to the conference finals and got absolutely abused on defense despite having the entire scheme built around protecting him. He's so bad on defense his coach takes him out of games at the end of playoff games because he doesn't trust him. Also read the part where you claimed Jokic only has a bad defensive rating because of the lineups except Jamal Murray MPJ and Aaron Gordon all have lower defensive ratings without him on the court so we know thats not the reason! Also the idea that because teams dont attempt as many inside shots against Jokic as they do against Embiid is because the nuggets have to shrink the court and stunt every single PnR which is why they get BOMBED on from 3. He's one of the 10 worst defenders in the NBA and the Lakers beat the nuggets because of it.
"&gt;If you're a true fan of Jokic, you should hope the award goes to someone else  true, I hope it goes to Aaron Gordon"
Aaron Gordon in shambles
Aaron Gordon is NOT a better defender than Wiggins lmao. That would be a good take for 1.5 years ago maybe.  Wiggins is the better player all around imo. The only edge Gordon really has is playmaking.
"Aaron Gordon is a way, way better defender and fits better as a role player on a good team though.  Wiggins is maybe more talented overall, but if you're looking for a complimentary role player you definitely prefer Gordon.  I think the Nuggets are much better off with Gordon than they would be with Wiggins."
"Yeah, people like the idea of Aaron Gordon more than they actually like the actual player"
"Aaron Gordon ain't better than Wiggins, a decently efficient 18 ppg scorer with good defense."
"That 2014 draft has been quite the roller coaster.  A lot of hype early on, and then injuries and bad situations kind of tamped down expectations. But, now, a lot of those players have carved out really solid careers.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2014.html  Embiid, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Marcus Smart, and Aaron Gordon are the top 5 players from that lottery, and the 2nd round had Jokic, Jerami Grant, &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie...  So, potentially, the top 2 MVP candidates, and 4 all stars total from that draft this season. Pretty impressive. Just not who we expected them to be coming out...  Just goes to show you have to wait several years before truly judging a draft. But, we’ll still judge anyway... 😒"
"yeah I hate to say it but he sucks and our GM refusing to trade him for a good piece in the trade deadline still frustrates me, especially when it was rumored he could have been the piece to get this squad Aaron Gordon instead of the Nugs. Also ur not wrong about the disillusioned part, but I'm a disillusioned blazers fan holding onto hope that we won't get swept in the first round lol"
"""It's probably 9/10 stake.""  \- Aaron Gordon, probably"
19/20 Aaron Gordon. Might have to enter a dunk contest (someone plz bring a trampoline)
Well shit I guess I like Dwade sorry Aaron Gordon
"Dwade has a lot of haters. A whole compilation of Dirtt player, Aaron gordon, and cheated on Gabrielle union."
"His team is really good. I would argue the 76ers are just slightly better (or were before the Nugs got Aaron Gordon). Tobias Harris is having an excellent season (at least as good as Jamal, probably better), and Ben Simmons is a top 2 DPOY candidate. It's debatable for sure, and I think it's close. I just think it's tough to give a guy MVP when he's missed 25% of the season, and likely more by season's end as I suspect Embiid won't play in every remaining game.  EDIT: Another thing to note is that LeBron has played more games than Embiid this year and doesn't seem to be in the conversation at all since his injury, despite having the Lakers playing arguably the best ball in the league while their second best player was having a major down year before getting injured for months."
"It is disingenuous to use net rating to explain why one player is playing less minutes per game than the other?   So you are saying that the Sixers beating teams by 12 on average with Embiid on the court wouldn't result in him sitting more often than someone with a lower net rating?   And besides that - Jokic is the one with better teammates lmao. Murray, Barton, MPJ, and Aaron Gordon is a better lineup than Curry, Green, Simmons, Tobias. Even if you take out AG it is still arguable. Let's not pretend Jokic is playing with scrubs."
Because he's a 5 playing the 4. Aaron Gordon would have fit perfectly in Indiana for the same reason he's been so good in Denver.
He averaged 31 and 16 on 65% TS against a god awful 8th-seeded Magic team lacking Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac. He then went on to average 22 and 11 on 55% TS against the Miami Heat. Monster statlines don't really matter unless you're actually playing a good team.
"Can I get an F in the chat for all my fantasy bballers whose teams have been decimated this season? For a stretch I had Embiid, LBJ, SGA, Dlo, Aaron Gordon and Lowry all sat with injuries."
"Exactly what we need, A slashing wing would be a dream come true. Aaron Gordon would've been perfect 😭"
"Last years slam dunk contest, voting Aaron Gordon a 9 which lost it for him"
And only a fraction of Aaron Gordon
Lauri is the new Aaron Gordon of trade rumors.
"And get some good defensive pieces around him like Aaron Gordon and maybe a sharp shooter like fournier, now that'd be a decent team."
Just because I don't think we were exciting to watch doesn't mean I don't appreciate the team.  Get the hell out of here with the gatekeeping.  Our play style wasnt3 the appealing wing scorer type.  Frankly our more recent teams ran a more appealing style of ball even if less effective.  Vuc was a more fun post scorer than Dwight and we had no one who could get up like Aaron Gordon on those teams.
Yes and no. Jokic will still get his numbers (prob will have to do more work). Aaron Gordon was a solid addition. The question is more on: Will the clippers and pg13 stay consistent throughout the playoffs?
"Nah our GM never wants to let go of dudes he drafts in the first round. He gave Meyers Leonard 40 million dollars, apparently refused to include Anfernee Simons in trade packages for Aaron Gordon"
"To do any kind of 360 dunk you aren't going for height but moreso distance. Instead of jumping as high as possible you are jumping as outwardly as possible and spinning. I understand what you guys are saying since I'm in that boat, 6'3 and can yam on 10 ft hoops so on a 9 ft hoop I feel like it's 7 ft.   But how effortless this dunk looks, it almost seems like it would need to  defy gravity if it's on a 10 ft hoop.. Aaron Gordon did a similar dunk but he spun into clutching the ball which is more reasonable... This was even harder and reverse spin, then clutched it and dunked."
Is it that bad of an injury tho like that’s a whole year.He is gonna miss the playoffs tho nuggets cannot really contend without him unless jokic plays like superhuman or mpj and Aaron Gordon puts up really huge numbers
"Yep. Should really never pick a player if they've ever had an injury. Very stupid thinking from Philly, we should let Michael Porter Jr fall to 14 in every draft! Genius. I wish we had Aaron Gordon or Dante Exum now!"
"Lol my guy says Kawhi doesn’t even try in the regular season, then tells me to go watch a year 2019 in which AG was Kawhis bitch. Since Aaron Gordon and Kawhi couldn’t play against each other in the playoffs in 2019 unless it was the nba finals and the clippers and the magic weren’t in the finals in 2019 wtf are you telling me to go moon at when you said my regular season arguement doesn’t matter?   What’s so hard for your brain to understand that even if this time AG was kawhis bitch, that was when AG was in Orlando, as the number 1 option you fucking fool. Do you have to be a genius to see AG isn’t the number one or even the number two option on the nuggets and we got his just to expend defensive energy on guys like Kawhi. But for some reason you make it seem like only a genius could see that because you can’t evaluate situations that are right in front of you properly.   Your argument has flawed logic if any and your team will never ever make the WCF goodbyeeeeeeeeeeee"
"I tried connecting Jae Crowder to Rajon Rondo, R.J. Hampton to Aaron Gordon etc, players who were traded for each other but technically never played with eachother but it shows that they did, any way to fix?"
LeBron - 39  Durant - 39  Lu Dort - 1.5  Duncan Robinson - 1.6  Aaron Gordon - 18
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"1. You base all that on the fact that he relies entirely in his athleticism. You want to believe that because he has a poor shot selection, according to you again, that he has a low BBIQ. But his assists totals completely disprove that.  1. No, most top guards aren't better defender than rw that's just laughable.   1. From the list you make, none of those role players would be hindered by playing with rw. Iguodala main role is running the 2nd team, that's hardly clashing. Yeah slashers role player like aaron gordon don't really fit with rw but there aren't many of those in the league. Sabonis growth is natural, that's called growing into your prime, same for Dipo, I don't see what's unnatural with it.  1. Ofc he ""hunts"" triple double to some extent, who doesn't want a player making 10+ assists, points &amp; rebounds ? Point me a player that's going to avoid making assists in order to not score a triple double maybe ? On the rebound category, first players leaving westbrook don't see an uptick in their rebounding averages : [just look at Steven Adams numbers if you don't believe me](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/adamsst01.html). 2nd every team wants russ to make those rebounds because of the fastbreak that results in those. I know it isn't a flashy TS% stat, but fastbreak is still an important component of NBA basketball.  1. You found a total whooping of 1 game where KD carried russ lmao. Congrats on proving how hard he was carried by KD  1. Oh yeah, the spurs didn't have a trio of superstars, the Dirk title didn't have a stacked mavs team and the 2012 2016 warriors had virtually 0 allstars. Thanks for your contribution to the list of team who had playoff success without 2+ allstars lmao."
"1. No, there's nothing wrong with being an elite athlete, but relying entirely on your athleticism over improving your fundamentals makes you predictable, and predicable players get shutdown in the postseason.  There are all sorts great players that come from different molds from Jokic, to Curry, Lebron, Kawhi. Embiid, etc.  The one commonality between all these players is they have deep tool kits, allowing them to beat you in a myriad of ways, WB is just a one trick pony, and its a good trick, but not good enough to make a deep playoff run.    2. His defense is the same as his offense, entirely reliant on athleticism, with poor fundamentals, he makes flashy play but get beat way to regularly, most top guards are wayyy better defenders than WB, which is sad since he has significantly better tools than most of them  3. Within the NBA ecosystem there are a variety of different types of role players.  Some are purely one dimensional guys, spacers like Korver or Mcdermott, defenders like Thybulle, they have one elite skill and are meh at everything else.  Others have 2 skills they excel at, 3&amp;D players like Danny Green, Alex Caruso, etc.  Still others are multi dimensional role players, like Andre Iguodala, Aaron Gordon, etc.  WB turns all role players into one dimensional tools, which if youre a one dimensional role player is great, but if you have more to your game it hurts those players ability to contribute by crowbaring a round peg into a square hole (see Oladipo's and Sabonis's growth after they left OKC).    4. Sure but WB takes it to another level, dude hunts Triple doubles.  There is no rebound myth, lmfao WB collects tons of ez defensive rebounds rather than leaking out so his bigs can pass him the ball to start the break.  You can easily inflate assists, just run low percentage actions off P&amp;R, EZ.  5. Ah yes the KD choked narrative, lets look at the final 3 games of that series  Game 5:   KD: 12-31, 40 pts, 7 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 3 TO's, -4  WB: 11-28, 31 pts, 7 rebs, 8 assists, 5 steal, 1 block, 7 TO's, -9  Verdict: they either both choked or both played meh  Game 6:  KD: 10-31, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 2 steal, 3 block, 3 TO's, -6  WB: 10-28, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 9 assists, 4 steal, 0 block, 5 TO's, -11  Verdict: once again they both chocked, but WB def chocked the game away turning the ball over 4 times in the final 2 mins  Game 7:   KD: 10-19, 27 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 2 TO's, -4  WB: 7-21, 19 pts, 7 rebs, 13 assists, 2 steal, 0 block, 3 TO's, -14  Verdict: WB chocked  WB chocked 3 out of 3 games, KD chocked 2 out 3.  Also just for fun Wb career playoff stats  106 games played, 24.8 pts, 7.7 A, 7.0 Rebs, 1.8 steals, .3 blocks, on 41/30/83 splits, with an eFG of 44.4.  6. 2011 playoffs, game 5  OKC vs. Denver, KD definitely didnt carry his ass.    KD: 14-27, 41 points, 5 rebs, 2 assist, 1 steal, 2 blocks, 0 TO's,   WB: 3-15, 14 points, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 0 blocks, 3 TO's  7.  Really?  Then how were the Spurs so successful? or the Mavs with Dirk?  or the early 2000's Pistons?  Or the 2012-2016 warriors?  There are plenty of teams that found postseason success without multiple superstars.  Virtually every WB centric team has catered to his needs and its proven not to work.  If he needs such a narrow team construction that its virtually impossible for a GM as good as Presti to build around him, maybe he just isnt that great of a player."
"How has Aaron Gordon been. Just remembered that he got traded there...I haven't heard much about him.  Looking at stats it seems like he hasn't been that good: 25.9 minutes, 10.2 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.7 steals, 0.6 blocks, 0.7 3PM, 56.4% TS."
You expect Aaron Gordon to knock down that 3 when RoCo helps off him? MPJ might get a hockey assists in that situation.
Michael Porter Jr has equal scoring the last few weeks.  Campazzo passes as well as Jokic.  Aaron Gordon was 18 ppg on the Magic.  Tons of bench talent.   The Warriors have been just as good as the nugs when Wiseman or Oubre sit.
"Facu, Shaq Harrison, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsapp, Javale, Austin Rivers. They’ve all been plus defenders. The fact you said Jamychal Green is a good defender kinda diminishes what you said."
"Blazers have better defensive role players, that's for sure.  Covington, DJJ, Powell, Hollis-Jefferson are all good defenders.  Who's good at defense on the Nuggets? JaMychal Green and Aaron Gordon?"
I think adding a versatile creator at the 4 would just help more.  Those players are hard to find but Aaron Gordon when he becomes a FA is the perfect player next to Sabonis.
"Defensively yes, but I think the issue is offensively.  Sabonis is clearly a center and Turner despite the shooting isn't versatile enough as a driver or on the ball to be that guy next to Sabonis.  You'd probably want like an Aaron Gordon or Siakam type because of the balk handling and the attacking the basket element."
"If Powell is on MPJ, because Covington is on Jokic; then CJ McCollum is covering Aaron Gordon"
"&gt;Acting like MPJ Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokic are incapable of scoring on the offensive end is silly  Lot easier to guard them when you aren't worried about Facu and have a non-factor on offense in McGee dude. Not like Gordon is much of a threat outside of the paint either.  Which, you know, would be clogged with McGee there  &gt;McGee will force Nurkic down in the paint and off Jokic or he’ll feast  That's the point dude. Nurkic gets to hang out in the paint. Just throw Covington on Jokic and you double him any time he gets in the paint with Nurk  MPJ ain't gonna beat us himself Can always just throw in DJJ if Powell is struggling. The point is that the Blazers guards would fucking exploit the hell out of McGee and Jokic in the PnR. That lineup is flat out too slow to be running around chasing these Blazers guards. You want Jokic running around the perimeter on defense? Or McGee?"
Could be aaron gordon dunk contest highlights?
"He is a 1-2 option on the worst team in the league as opposed to a 3-4 option on a contender. This was always going to be the case and he’s really not proving anything IMO. In fact, I think he did himself a disservice as he is not getting visibility and a chance to show up in deep playoff series. I’m not a salty Denver fan either, I’m actually happy the way it happened as I think Aaron Gordon is a better fit for us, I just don’t think people should be using Grant as an example of players who made good decisions believing in themselves because I think he hurt his value by forcing this move"
Honestly if Murray never got injured I think Aaron Gordon fits the Nuggets more than Grant anyway. Although it would’ve been nice to keep Hampton and Harris
I don’t think anyone is scared of Aaron Gordon lol
I dint think anyone is scared of Aaron Gordon lol
I’m sorry Aaron Gordon went 7/8 3PTS in a game this season?
"Aaron Gordon has made the playoffs one time before this year, in 2018-19 where the magic were the 7 seed"
The Aaron Gordon inclusion for he trick y’all is apt
"you gettin shit for this but   &gt;Lonzo Ball, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, Michael Porter Jr, Nikola Jokic  this would definitely be a REALLY good starting lineup  nets are gonna be favorites as long as the big 3 is intact tho"
They beat a healthy LA clippers too. And MPJ is way better this season. And they picked up Aaron Gordon
"Whoa man i love jokic too but you're talking Jokic turning Austin rivers or campazzo into a superstar like player Jamal Murray, thats utterly ridiculous. In playoff basketball where you're facing the same team 4 out of a possible 7 times then players like Rivers/Capazzo get exposed while real Superstars like Murray don't need Jokic to up his game. Jokic killed the Clips last playoffs but Murray ripped their heart out. Without Murray then Jokic is gnna have to rely on Rivers or campazzo to make a play when he's out and that isn't gonna happen.  Whereas Gobert knows that Mitchell, who is a superstar will take up the scoring load and leadership while he just plays defense.   Jokic may end up getting some great games from MPJ/Milsap but AAron Gordon may get lost in his 1st playoff series and c'mon now lets face reality here Austin Rivers is not gonna make the same impact that Murray does."
This year’s dunk contest wasn’t great (due partially to the weird format) but some of the recent ones have been excellent. LaVine and Aaron Gordon especially have had some of the best dunks of all time.
"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
"I know the team pretty well dw. Its just that denver aint got a chance of defending LeBron and AD. Same as last year. And so we're both clear, aaron gordon aint gonna do it. I guess we'll find out soon unless denver doesnt make it which is more likely. You're a bit too confident in denver my friend."
Nah a dunk over Tacko is only worth 9 points actually @aaron gordon
They now have Javale McGee and Aaron Gordon.  And  Porter is a matchup nightmare on offense.  I have a feeling Jokic and Porter will start but will have limited minutes.  Denver loses and Clippers win if they choose to do so to get Blazers in the first round as a 3 seed.  Or they can choose to lose and stay at 4 for the Mavs.  Potential Round 2 matchups are in flux at this point.
Is Aaron Gordon not good?
Aaron Gordon - Having the most fun he's had playing basketball in years
He is no where near Kawhi level as an on ball defender.  Aaron Gordon was always the better on ball defender on our team when both were healthy.  Isaac is more like a Giannis type of defender.
"People didn't factor in just how much better Nuggets got with the addition of Aaron Gordon.  Whatever they lost from Jamal Murray/Will Barton is made back from Aaron Gordon, and Austin Rivers miraculously turning into Steph Curry in Q4's."
"Hes still one of the slower, more immobile players in a pace and space, 3pt heavy, high pnr league. Honestly, I dont think anyone's giving aaron gordon credit for what hes done with that defense. Since acquiring him, the Nuggets have been able to switch on more screens and  they're defending them better."
"Aaron Gordon too tbh. He clamored to get off a bad Orlando team onto a contender, time to step up."
"Herro is better and 4 years younger, not even a comparison. Kuz is older than Aaron Gordon who was drafted in 2014 lol."
Suns in 6. Nuggets do not have the perimeter defense to guard Booker and CP3 with Murray out and Ayton is a very capable defender that can slow Jokic down enough to make it happen. They also have home court advantage and wing defenders to make sure Aaron Gordon and MPJ don't go crazy.
What about Aaron Gordon ?  Nuggets record 21-7 with Gordon  Nuggets record 26-18 without Gordon
I think Nuggets Sixers would be fun at full strength.  MVP finalist and a high power offense vs  DPOY finalist ( Embiid pretty much would be one too ) and multiple great defenders.     The two best centers in the Game going at it.   Simmons and MPJ matching up a lot.   Aaron Gordon and Tobias Harris in similar roles and importance matching up. ( obviously if Embiid is out or hindered then Harris has a bigger role and importance ).    Would be fun.
"All I'm saying is that people should give Jokic's teammates a little more respect. He for sure makes a lot of space and elevates his team. He's a big guy who seems like he can do literally everything. However...  In the regular seasons Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, and Paul Millsap have been putting up similar numbers on different teams for years. MPJ was one of the top prospects in 2017 and a first round pick. Jamal Murray is already good. Will Barton's numbers shot up as soon as he joined the Nuggets, before Jokic even joined them.  It's harder to tell with Monte Morris, Facundo and Markus Howard because they've only ever played with Jokic but I assume he just makes them better when he's on the floor with them, so you could be right about them."
"aaron gordon is doing something similar in these very playoffs, though not as extreme"
"I appreciate the idea with the Pacers but when you look at the Blazers needs in depth it doesn't really work out.  The Blazers desperately need a proper small forward; a 3-guard lineup doesn't work especially when the backcourt duo of Dame and CJ are poor defenders. I know everybody wants to see CJ traded but he's essentially an overpaid point guard. Salary match is a massive issue to the point where it's going to hamper any return they could get on him.  Also it doesn't help that there isn't any big, defensive wings available. They tried for Aaron Gordon and came out short. Jerami Grant went to Detroit. I think Jerami Grant could be available but that would require forking over a ton of assets and probably finding a 3rd team for CJ since Detroit is trying to bottom out. Evan Fournier may be available if you overpay him, but he's not there to play defense. Same with Kelly Oubre.  Going back to an Indiana-Portland trade; neither Brogdon and Lamb are proper small forwards. They're bigger shooting guards and neither are defensive lynchpins. I just don't see what Portland gets out of that."
Aaron Gordon is good but he's not some big time difference maker as y'all make him out to be.  He looked nice cause he hit his threes.  That's rare and not something you should be expecting.
"Hi kind of a fan here.  He basically betrayed all of his friends after lebron went into a meltdown about the young’ns being garbage. Brown nosed the living shit out of lebron, and the Pelinka family. I made a comment a minute ago that he accomplished getting a ring, and a decent paycheck. If he gets sent to Orlando I guess he can be a weak substitute for Aaron Gordon since he left for the Nugs.   I for one wanted BI to stay, and develop as an actual decent sub for Lebron. Would’ve been better load management for our season games, and he could’ve been put  in at off positions during the playoffs in tougher games."
"It wasn't even that lol. Portland didn't want to give up Anfernee Simons in an Aaron Gordon trade, which is so dumb"
"CJ is one of these players who have undeniable skills, but are super awkward to actually fit into a real team. As an undersized 2 on a max deal, the value proposition just sucks, despite the fact that CJ is a pretty dope player.   The two players off the top of my head that he would fit really nicely with are Lonzo and Ben Simmons. Compare that to someone like Aaron Gordon (who makes less money) and how he could fit 30 teams."
Magic finally have cap space and have 4 young guards under contract. Trading into 32 mil a year for the next 3 years to keep our young guys on the bench isn’t going to work. That’s why this is a no for me.   The deal should’ve been Aaron Gordon for cj 2 years ago.   Also Otto porter is a UFA so that doesn’t work either
"As a magic fan it's really great to see Gordon thriving and doing well. Loosing vuc definitely hit harder but it still sucked loosing Aaron aswell but glad he's found a place with the nuggets, hope you guys go far!"
Aaron gordon at home:
There's Aaron Gordon.
"Because I watched this series vs the Blazers where they consistently made multiple mistakes on the defensive end and showcased an astonishing lack of intelligence both in the help sense and outside of Shaq Harrison and Aaron Gordon, on the on ball sense."
Not even that young. He's older than Aaron Gordon.
"The important thing to understand is *why* you were wrong.  In this case, I think it's age.   People ALWAYS overestimate the ceilings of older prospects who are more NBA-ready when they play useful minutes in the first couple of years.   Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, who was picked in 2014.  Tatum is one day older than Obi Toppin, who was picked in 2020. Kuzma and Tatum were in the same draft  class."
"I did watch the game and to say the refs stole the game from Portland is an insane take. I get that you're biased but that's a cop out. The Blazers scored 14 points in the 4th, Lillard shot 27% from 3, Aaron Gordon put up a couple clutch shots, etc. How many fouls were called against Portland in the 4th?  Chocking this up to the refs is intellectually lazy and disingenuous."
to orlando as part of the aaron gordon trade
"You’re not giving your team enough credit. Without Murray the Nuggets aren’t a championship contender, but they’re still a really fucking good team. You don’t need a ton of guards when you have Jokic passing and you guys picked up Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers late in the season."
Aaron gordon needs to go into Marion mode. jokic gonna do less posting more passing from top of the key
"A star player needs to go to a team that competes. For example, Blazers lost to a Jamal less Nuggets in 6. Dame needs a better team around him or go to a better team that's more suitable.  Aaron Gordon went to the Nuggets and they aren't a superteam but he's in a position to compete now."
Shout out to aaron gordon. Dude was tired of losing and found himself in a pretty good situation
"Damian Lillard... what a great player. Shame Portland couldn't really put the best pieces around him.  Nikola Jokic showed why he's MVP. 36/8/6 in a close-out game, and his teammates stepped up hitting big shots like MPJ (who kept them in the game in the 1st), Monte Morris (who hit the shot to end the 3rd) and Austin Rivers and Aaron Gordon (who hit key 3s to put the game out of reach)."
Lol the dagger 3 came from..... Aaron fuckin Gordon.
"I have to say, I thought Aaron Gordon was going to be a bigger factor for the Nuggies when the trade was made. I've actually been really surprised how irrelevant he has been."
Must be nice for Aaron Gordon to be playing for a winning playoff team
Aaron Gordon gets to the second round for the first time
"when aaron gordon shoots 3's better than your team, welp."
Aaron Gordon waves goodbye to the Blazers
Aaron Gordon waves goodbye to the Blazers
dagger... from aaron gordon lmao
When Aaron Gordon is much clutch than Norm
Aaron Gordon dagger?!
"Wow, never thought the words “Aaron Gordon with the dagger” would be said in the Playoffs"
Aaron Gordon hitting a dagger 3 is not how I saw this game ending lmaooo
Aaron Gordon sends his regards :)
Imagine Aaron Gordon hitting a 3 to completely end your season ouch
Aaron Gordon... bro.
Imagine having Aaron Gordon hit a dagger
Aaron Gordon with the dagger didn’t expect that.
"Aaron Gordon is the guy you want shooting, that might be it"
AARON GORDON WITH ADAGGER
"Also because expectations are different. Keldon Johnson is a good player but he isn't a star. So that's a great pick for like 29th overall or wherever they selected him.  But a top 3 pick who is just a starter or 6th man is a disappointment.  Also a couple of other factors which I think are important. Early in the first you are selecting on talent and potential. Whereas later in the first you are selecting on current ability and attitude. This means you are more likely to get a player who will put in the work to succeed even though they aren't as talented.   A good comparison of this I would say is someone like Jordan Poole (I picked him because he is the easiest example I can think of) and Marvin Bagley 3. Bagley is one of the most talented players in the league. 6'11 fluid athlete can jump 35 inches, arms for days, ball handling and shooting potential. And he is just ass because he doesn't work hard enough.  Another Factor is passion for the game. A lot of bigs don't like bball they are just big and athletic which means when they were basically shoehorned into basketball.  Plus then you have organisational fit as you mentioned but not just about development. But like late in the draft teams draft for the needs early teams tend to go BPA. This means a team late in the draft will be getting a player they know exactly how they want to use. Whereas high in the draft you might be shoe horning them into an awkward role they aren't suited for say Aaron Gordon as a 3 on the magic."

Aaron Gordon is so close to really good
"every time i see aaron gordon, i feel bad for orlando..........that franchise going nowhere"
Lol Aaron Gordon with a random 3
"Aaron Gordon really lacks explosiveness.. Dude has hops, but really can't elevate quickly."
"Lillard just playing with Aaron Gordon, Gordon TRASH"
But I heard Aaron Gordon was gonna lock him up?
aaron gordon looks like a fat michael beasley
Has Aaron Gordon had one good game this series?
aaron gordon sexiest player on the court
Aaron Gordon makes baffling decisions
need aaron gordon to do a 360 dunk randomly
Why is Aaron Gordon not defending Dame anymore?
MPJ is what people thought Aaron Gordon could be
Silver lining to Murray getting injured is MPJ has really been able to step up. Denver has a legit naturally created big 3 for the future + Aaron Gordon who is only 25
Also Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon
"Then you find a better bench point guard.  Or try to get a secondary playmaker like Aaron Gordon.  Nuggets were able to get that deal done despite the fact Gary Harris sucks. At some point, Olshey should've swallowed the bitter pill and moved on from CJ when his value was high.  You can't keep saying Blazers are failing Dame but then argue against moving CJ."
This is not true my dude. Porter Jr. or Aaron Gordon is the Nuggets' second best player? Meanwhile CJ was on an all-star pace before his injury early in the season. Dame is fantastic but there's a reason Jokic is the MVP this season.
"Sure thing. I’ll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
All 50's are not created equal.  Just ask Aaron Gordon.
Not to mention Pacers literally offered Myles Turner for Gordon Hayward yet Ainge was being too greedy and wanted Aaron Holiday.
Marcus Smart for Aaron Gordon? There were a bunch of headlines like that.
"Aaron Gordon is too big and woulda fouled Dame on his shot opportunity if he played him man up, 100%."
"This is fucking insane. He calls Aaron Gordon for the cut and then uses it to freeze Covington in No-Man’s-Land, and sends the ball to Porter for a wide open 3. It didn’t even look like AG knew what was going on and didn’t realize what happened until porter drilled the shot lol."
I was hoping for a cj for Aaron Gordon trade the last few years. We could’ve a protected first too.
"Damn, I never thought about Aaron Gordon with Dame. That would have been good!"
Well his chubby and slow and not athletic. We make it work though. We just have to find the Jerami Grant/Aaron Gordon type guys who are look enough to take on a big defensively
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
"Lakers dont have anyone near as good as MPJ or Aaron Gordon lol, nor is Murray as good/important to the team as AD."
You have to double triple team him there why is Aaron Gordon not coming to double wtf is Covington going to do from all the way out there
(insert clip of Lowry boxing out Aaron Gordon)
Aaron Gordon looking baked af on the bench lmao
aaron gordon has 0 BBIQ
Malone really let Aaron Gordon inbound
Aaron Gordon ran from the smoke. Fucking coward left a rookie on an island there.
I can’t believe RoCo was wasting his defensive prowess sticking Aaron fucking Gordon on that play instead of helping. Gave Monte a bunny
Why isn't Aaron Gordon smothering Dame?
Aaron Gordon is so bad on offense
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
Aaron Gordon doing his best Luka Doncic impression missing 2 clutch FTs what a baller
Aaron “Lebron ‘Shaquille O’Neal’ James” Gordon
covington or aaron gordon  who is a better player?
"i fucking hate denver sometimes for that shit...the fuck is austin rivers, aaron gordon and morris doing hogging the fucking ball while mpj is going from one end to another...dude touched the ball twice for two quick passes since it was 59-39"
"I was honestly expecting Aaron Gordon to be a much bigger factor in the series, specially considering Murray is out."
Aaron Gordon is soo overrated
Kelly oubre is low key better than Aaron Gordon
Yeah we have plenty of fire power  I kinda doubt Aaron Gordon is gonna be making pull up transition 3s all game lmao
Aaron Gordon taking pull up threes with confidence ?
Aaron Gordon shooting 3s
"He's being guarded by Facu, who Nuggets fans were convinced was gonna clamp him, and Aaron Gordon.  Is that somehow a lot different from Luka who's doing all his scoring against Zubac and Beverly?"
"Denver will never be able to ""draw"" super star talent. That's why we paid old ass Paul Milsap 30 mil a year and had to trade for Aaron Gordon who I assume will leave in FA. We have to do everything we can to keep MPJ."
Watching Aaron Gordon shoot gives me ptsd
Torrey Craig &gt; Aaron Gordon
"Good thing Aaron Gordon made a documentary about the dunk contest, and that he wears #50 to show us that he dunks well in the dunk contest.   Because I wouldn't be able to tell you what else he does without it."
AARON GORDON SUCKS
I feel like Jokic mic’d up telling Aaron Gordon to play better while Gordon stares off into space is a great metaphor for this Denver team
"Damn... Jalen Rose just trashed Aaron Gordon. ""0-7,  I've see that happen too many times.""  &amp;#x200B;  Would McGee be a good substitution for the 2nd half? If Gordon's shot then it's an obvious no but 0-7 is like he summoned his inner Kyle Trushma aka Kuz."
"Blake Griffin in the playoffs is who Denver thought they were getting when they traded for Aaron Gordon, instead they got this..."
"Aaron Gordon is a muscular guy who plays basketball, as opposed to a basketball player who is muscular"

Bringing Aaron Gordon to Denver was dangerous. Man needs to stop with the dabs before games
Aaron Gordon... yikes!
Aaron Gordon got no offensive bag at all he has is being athletic

Didn't Aaron Gordon used go be pretty good?  What happened?
Aaron Gordon selling HARD
Aaron Gordon trick y’all
Aaron Gordon is buns lmao
I think it’s safe to say Aaron Gordon is just not a good offensive player
Aaron Gordon playing well for the Suns
Aaron Gordon was supposed to be a game changer when Denver traded for him
Wasn’t it Aaron Gordon - the dude with 2 playoff wins before joining the Nugs - who was bitching in the locker room about people not playing tough enough? The same Aaron Gordon who has gone 3-12 since then?   Lulz
"Aaron Gordon is the same dude that he was in Orlando. He has a good game (20+ points, 10-12 boards) and then he disappears for 4 or 5 games."
Aaron Gordon is worse than Torrey Craig lol
What *is* an Aaron Gordon?
What is the point of Aaron Gordon. What does he do exactly?
Aaron Gordon has scored 6 points in 6 quarters since calling his teammates out in the locker room...
"Aaron Gordon and MPJ are such a bad fit together, they clog the paint. and next to Jokic too? idk about it tbh."
aaron gordon should stop shooting
Aaron Gordon out there giving it his all and nothing else 😭
Not only is Aaron Gordon ass on offense he also decides to leave CP3 wide open for 3 smh
Aaron Gordon is fucking horrible
Aaron Gordon is pretty bad offensively

Aaron Gordon getting offensive strategy  tips from Kyle Kuzma
Wasn’t Aaron Gordon really good for them when they first got him? And hasn’t he been okay recently? I thought he was filling his role pretty well. I may be way off here
"this is likely the answer. Also maybe Kelly Oubre, Porzingis and Aaron Gordon (hasn't done much for Denver)."
"Haha well he’s an exception to a rule because he’s so elite at offense and can also pass like a pg.  That being said I think the nuggs still have difficulty building a top 5 defense bc it’s hard to do with the other positional groups, but 100% worth because his offense is next level  Lack of rim protection at the 5 is why someone like Aaron gordon is such a great get because you get a big build and size/defensive prowess at the next biggest position"
&gt; that just means they have the ability to keep up with all kinds of players. Don’t mean they actually stopping shit.  *Aaron Gordon has entered the chat*
"Aaron Gordon looks terrible too on Denver, not even a solid 4th option"
" &gt;Not that I think anyone is directly thinking ""alright the Blazers got RoCo, no more excuses"" but he does make a starting 5 feel more complete than they actually are  This was definitely the case for twolves and rockets. I feel for the blazers because they just got destroyed by injuries/covid protocol. So their core of defence (nurkic) was missing and having Roco felt like it did nothing for them.  To me the 3&amp;D player is definitely overvalued because it's needed by so many teams. On 1 hand I felt r/nba was completely over valuing Jerami Grant for us when he left.... But then on the other hand we won 12/14 games when we signed Aaron Gordon and our team looked so complete that I thought we could win it all (till jamals ACL..). AG's defence has been a revelation, but like all role player 3&amp;D guys, the 3 seems to come and go wildly."
Dame needs a secondary playmaker who can push the ball in transition. Like an  Aaron Gordon.
"well thats gonna happen in the postseason, people get really physical  hell aaron gordon shoulder charged jae crowder just last night, lebron gave a hockey bodycheck to ayton in the first round.   kawhi gave joe ingles a body check in game 1"
"Both sides know the Nuggets lack floor spacing with where they are at right now and it's what's driving all this. Overloading the strong side, shading help towards Jokic, funneling drives certain directions, Nuggets just make it easier for all that with their injuries and the guys left to put around Jokic. Gotta set up the threat of Aaron Gordon as a cutter with how you horizontally distribute players. That and the Suns are going to prioritize rotating to the corner or the weak side pass which they know Jokic can obviously throw, you have to be able to find ways to align Michael Porter Jr where he's kind of ""splitting the difference per se"" between Jokic and the guys in the corner/lining up on the weak side. Make MPJ too close to Jokic its too easy to double Jokic and rotate back on MPJ, put him too far from Jokic doesnt do anything to help the spacing. All this and just running a few off ball simple flare screens on the weak side would help alot. Might be time to bring out the Jokic/MPJ pick and roll a few times ala Jokic/Murray even if it wont work the same with Jokic on ball."
" &gt;Is there any guard in the league besides harden and cp3 that could have stopped a Gordon backdown?  Yes, many. Aaron Gordon is not a good post up player or shot creator was one of the biggest issues with him in Orlando. And the fact they are choosing to target Booker over a 5'11 36 year old guard for that tells you alot."
"The Nuggets seem a little stuck offensively. Their options look super limited these past 2 games. Not sure what they'll need to do (apart from shoot better, but that's always hard to do when that's your only viable option).  I feel like MPJ bailed out the Suns by shooting too many 3's off the handoff.  Aaron Gordon has been great for the Nugs as a source of offense (bullying the Suns guards, mainly Booker), but it's definitely not a long term solution."
"Wow bro, chill. We can just talk without getting all stressed out lol. You seem like you’re close to calling names here.   My point of nurk and dame still applies. If Melo is standing in the corner while dame scores off a nurk pick, melo’s +- benefits from that. that’s an indication of melo’s impact on the floor. they have to respect melo in the corner, and that’s where melo’s value comes from in that game. Even if he’s not drilling threes for a game, you can’t give him open shots. If for some reason a player is out of position, or blows a defensive assignment, the +- goes down for each player on the entire team. That also makes sense.   So a guy like Devin Booker who runs down and hits a pull-up, then gets put in the basket by Aaron Gordon on the other end, there is no benefit to either team here. So Booker’s plus-minus ought to reflect that.   Again, don’t be rude because +- is best measured per 100 possessions. Pace this year was 99.2, just shy of 100. Doesn’t it stand to reason that If +- per game is not a good indicator of player contribution to winning that game, measuring the stat by per 100 possessions is also a bad measure?   The validity of +- per player is pretty clear because winning basketball doesn’t just consist of points, rebounds and assists. Like those big 3 stats, +- is an indicator of how a player contributes to their team, only in intangible or non-counted, or obscure ways.   Like there’s no stat for “distance primary defender must travel to play help defense on a successful pick and roll in a half court set.” But they do have +-, lol."
all i want to know is... what the hell is aaron gordon doing?
Aaron Gordon: actually not very good at basketball.
He’s injured man. Playing with a stiff back. It’s impossible to move the way he was doing throughout the game. I would still give him props for playing through the pain and stiffness. If only Aaron Gordon hunted for Devin Booker like he did in game 1 every possession Denver would have still lost by 15 points.
"*Jokic pulls out phone*  Jokic: “Gordon!”  Aaron Gordon: “Yeah, what’s up?”  Jokic: “YOU NOT HOOPIN!”"
I saw aaron gordon just body someobe in the post in the 1st quarter and he never got the ball in the post again in the 1st half.
"Aaron Gordon needs to step the fuck up and run through some bitches and be a two way force.  As a talented veteran he could be the 2nd banana with Murray out, but he's disappearing and leaving the burden to Rivers, MPJ, Campazzo, Barton etc to step up. Very disappointing."
"Just side note - there was no Aaron Gordon hunting Booker in post. While I think this is offense the Suns will gladly take, I was surprised they didn’t at least go to it when the defense was forcing such poor shot selection."
"Yeah the timing was a little off. The 6MOTY was the best. Randle's MIP from his kid was incredibly touching. And Jokic's MVP during the team meeting had amazing wholesomeness along with the Aaron Gordon moment.  But this was still good because of Gobert's game winning block highlight from the night before.  Still, I'd like to hear a formal MVP speech from Jokic just to hear it."
Did Aaron Gordon fouled out? He needs to be the   2nd option I think.
"Aaron Gordon is a big time defender, but not much he could do, suns just had too much firepower the first 2 games"
To see him get by Aaron Gordon like that had me STOKED.
Aaron Gordon is a slightly better version of Kenneth Faried
Mpj back issues have clearly come back and fuck i hate this. We currently have to run everything through jokic cause Campazzo is to small Morris isn't good enough Aaron Gordon and mpj can't create and will Barton is clearly rusty fuck everything is bullshit we really going to have to start O Neal for his defense even though he has zero offensive game
Aaron Gordon doesn't really seem to be doing well.
It's way more reasonable than saying that Aaron Gordon is a better defender than Grant lol you showed that you know absolutely nothing. Gordon having decent defensive regular season numbers against good players isn't remotely close to playing amazing defense on a top 3 player in the league throughout a 7 game series. Watch the games lmao not just the highlights
"You value the regular season way too much. Barton hasn't proven shit (he was straight garbage in the 2019 playoffs) while Grant played amazing defense on Kawhi and was your third leading scorer in a really impressive playoff run. In the playoffs in a meaningful series I would take Jerami Grant by himself over having both Will Barton and Aaron Gordon. Also you say Grant has ""horrible efficiency"" yet he was more efficient than Will Barton on 10 more points per game. That's why the Nuggets tried to pay Grant but he preferred to be a leading scorer. Keep talking out of your ass though lmao"
"Aaron Gordon trick yall man. He just be running around, dunking over mascots"
"Me: that guy fighting looks a lot like Aaron Gordon. But can't be, he's on the Magic."
Is anyone else waiting for Aaron Gordon to take over the game?
Jae Crowder &gt; Aaron Gordon by far
Jae Crowder owns Aaron Gordon 😭😭
Aaron Gordon not Eric. You had me so confused
Aaron Gordon and toughness are two words I'd never associate with one another.  Athletic.  Defensive.  But tough.  Sure.
Aaron Gordon don't want it with Crowder I promise.
Aaron Gordon being a bitch. Shoved first
Aaron Gordon sees red every time he looks at Jae’s number
"Jokic really stepped up to a super star level, MPJ developed into looking like a legitimate all star, and Aaron Gordon is fitting into his role nicely. Just doesn’t seem like this is their year to go all the way. They are my favorites to win the title next year if they can stay healthy and Murray comes back looking good"
"Unfortunately 2 of the better Nuggets defenders, Murray and Dozier, are out. And Barton is on a heavy minutes restriction. Pretty much Aaron Gordon can stop the ball.  I won’t make any conclusions until I see Denver play at home and get some home cooking like PHO are getting right now, but realistically this series probably over."
"I mean we are missing Jamal, Aaron Gordon is brutally slept on and one of the better PFs in the game. MPJ is just streaky as fuck. Typically one dude can step up but nobody is doing that rn"
"I’d expect Facu to be the least likable lol. Do people not like Rivers, Aaron Gordon, MPJ, or Bol Bol?"
PG - CP3  SG - DBook   SF - MPJ  PF - Aaron Gordon  C - Nikola Jokic  6th Man - Jamal Murray  Record I think would be 68-14
"Hey Nuggets fans, how long do y’all have Aaron Gordon?  This team + Murray coming back next year 🔥"
Didn't know Aaron Gordon was a talker like that tbh.
"Imagine if Jeremy Grant had signed with Denver... Aaron Gordon is a great fit tho, they'd get all the way to the finals with Murray."
Who the hell does aaron gordon think he is
I forgot Aaron Gordon played for Denver.  I thought it was jacked Michael Beasley
AARON GORDON
Yeah no shit a deal for a player that Rockets never acquired wasn't on the table. That was a potential deal the Nuggets would've done in a heart beat before they traded for Aaron Gordon. I'm throwing out hypotheticals since you seem to think Simmons is some scrub on a 30 mil contract who has 0 value.   The draft is a complete crapshoot. Half the players drafted before and after MPJ or even Thybulle are not even NBA starter caliber players. Just because Sixers hit on those picks doesn't guarantee every team will. Look at the Sixers draft record for the past 6 years and see how often they were successful. I don't think they even have a 50% hit rate on them and that's probably on of the better drafters in this league.   Your only argument for the Nets deal being better than that Sixers deal rests on the blind hope that those picks somehow convey as lotteries and then somehow Rockets are able to draft properly and then hope that talent develops into an All Star/ All NBA caliber player barring injuries and other unforeseen circumstances. When you are currently saying that an All NBA player isn't worth those picks.   That Nets deal is god awful by every logical reason you can think of other than praying against all odds that they turn into lottery picks and even then it's debatable if those picks ever turn into anyone better than Ben Simmons.
How did you make this post and not mention Aaron Gordon at all lol
"this team would looks so, so different with Jamal Murray and Will Barton in there.  All of a sudden everything you get from Millsap, Rivers, Campazzo &amp; Green would be found money instead of ""need to have it every night.""  We've all seen Aaron Gordon when a defense can key on him, it wasn't the best.  As a 4th guy who can play the Shawn Marion role and live off action from others he was pretty potent and Denver looked like the real McCoy."
Aaron Gordon would like a word…
"Vince, Shannon Brown, Gerald Green, Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon,"
Aaron Gordon has to be on the list.   Shoutout to Dr. Dunkenstein as well.
"Outside of Mo Bamba, we’ve drafted really well for our position. The trades are just a separate bad move that were made except Sabonis because it was a draft night trade.  Oladipo was evaluated as the best prospect in a weird draft for us and he will end up being one of the better players from his draft.  Aaron Gordon was a good pick.  Cole Anthony.  Isaac.  All good players we drafted."
1. vince carter  2. blake griffin  3. shawn kemp  4. aaron gordon  5. dominique wilkins
"“If you ever judge a dunk competition at the ASG, make sure to screw over Aaron Gordon. He doesn’t even have to be competing”"
"I’ve never come away from an Aaron Gordon performance thinking, “that guy might be an All-Star”.  He’s in the Robert Covington tier of role players."
"Cmon man. If you give Lebron Jamal Murray, Aaron gordon, MPJ and the rest of that roster, it’s a guaranteed finals trip at the least. Jokic can pile the stats but he needs to win when it matters most for discussions like best player"
...aaron gordon bruh
Respectfully I don't think Aaron Gordon is the level of defender to faze these superstar talents.
Aaron Gordon is the best wing stopper in the association
Enjoy being an Orlando Magic fan. These are my opinions. Not trash talk. You want trash talk? Aaron Gordon was Lowry's bitch. I guess he still is?
Heat v. Celtics and Heat v. Bucks is still great.   D Wade giving Aaron Gordon a 9 because he played for the Magic and DJJ for the Heat is still epic.
"Aaron ""Mr. 50"" Gordon"
They don't call him Aaron Gordon for no reason
Doug McDermott  Jonathan Simmons  Elfrid Payton  Aaron Gordon  Mitch McGarry  Perry Jones
Aaron Gordon.  When he was progressing up to 2018 I thought he was going to continue to keep getting better and better.  It surprised me that his age 22 season was his best.
"Aaron ""Mr. 50"" Gordon"
Aaron Gordon guards him as well as anyone in the league
Aaron Gordon put on a fucking defensive clinic tonight. Luka has always had trouble with Gordon but it never got attention because he was in Orlando. Now he's on national TV giving a masterclass on the subject.
Aaron Gordon still like 13 in the face lmao
Aaron Gordon about to fuck around and get ejected for no reason
orlando will never not be a trash franchise. love the W. Aaron Gordon has never been screwed out of a dunk contest. Suggs doesn't resign unless he wants to stay in the Devos Gulag.
Same as Aaron Gordon
"The issue is that if you max MPJ you are basically committing long term to the trio of Murray, Jokic, MPJ as the core of the team and 75% of the cap space. Basically at that point the Nuggets will be trying to mix and match role players around them. I’m skeptical that they can even afford Aaron Gordon once MPJ gets his bag."
Always loved summer league. Summer League Aaron Gordon is one of the best players of all time.
That Aaron Gordon take is potentially the worst I've seen. no offense
Hasn’t he already surpassed Aaron Gordon? Or if not it’s close enough where I wouldn’t say that’s his ceiling. Maxing him is absolutely an overpay but I think his ceiling is closer to that of a 2-time allstar
I’ve heard Nuggets fans say that the idea of Aaron Gordon is better than actually having him and after watching him play in these past 4 games I can see what they mean
Aaron Gordon is like the youngest player from 2014 draft.  He’s still only 25 and doesn’t turn 26 until September
Yeah I guess I just associate him with a completely different time for the Lakers. I also still think of Aaron Gordon as a young player with potential.
"Plenty? Wiggins, Dlo, ibaka/Gasol, jerami grant, Aaron Gordon, vooch, d Rose, cp3, DeRozan prob will if he does"
"This question essentially answers itself, but Denver could potentially lose a major lose a major component.   Probably Aaron Gordon."
"Yeah. AD is definitely taking Campazzo, Austin Rivers and Aaron Gordon to the 3rd seed."
"Embiid trapped Trae at the 3 point line then ran all the way back and destroyed the lob to Capela at the rim. He consistently makes DPOY-level plays like that, intimidates people from even attempting to drive a lot of the time, and still averages 30 points a game. Jokic is amazing on offense, definitely a tier above Embiid. But he is 2 or 3 tiers below Embiid on defense.   Not a single person is afraid of him in the paint on defense and it shows.. players are more worried about Aaron Gordon than him lol.  I don't understand how people just gloss over Jokic's zero rim protection as the position who's primary job is the protect the rim."
there's no way Aaron Gordon gets a max  what other team would pay him that
"It *sort of* changed my opinion, sort of did not. Like credit to him he played great in those two games and really throughout that series mostly.   But I also am very aware that... who's the Mavs best defender / who did they try to guard him with? Maxi Kleber and DFS? Neither is great... So I reserve judgment. The Mavs defense didnt really have a good answer to at least make things difficult on him which the Nuggets did last year with Jerami Grant, and this year will again with Aaron Gordon (should they match up). Both guys are better defenders individually than any Mavs player they threw at him, really. Mikal Bridges is also better, as is Jae Crowder probably, should the Suns and Clippers meet in a WCF.   We shall see is all I'm saying. I still dont overall buy their offense without an elite playmaker. Still think there's too much isolation (though it's better than last year in that respect)."

"I don't think the Age 33 contract is going to be that bad, but the supermax just murders teams cap.  Also, Denver is gonna get really expensive really fucking fast, this, Murray's max, MPJ probably gonna get one or close to it and Aaron Gordon, which makes the Jamal inury even worse."
"After the AG trade, if you actually watched us play, you’d know that our entire starting 5 was balling on both ends of the floor.  AG did a ton to “unlock” some of our guys. It allowed flexibility and fluidity between him and Porter at the forward slots. And it also allowed 6’6” will Barton to slide up to his natural position of SG. So with Murray/Barton/Gordon/mpj/Jokic we were basically switching everything 1-4 and occasionally 1-5 as well. We had a ton of length and flexibility.  Additionally, he helped unlock offensive sets that were just near impossible to guard. We are all familiar with how deadly the Jokic-Murray 2 man game is, but we were actually able to incorporate Gordon and his rim pressure into that with Barton and mpj spotting up on the outside.  [This article goes into some depth on what he brings and some clips of what I was talking about](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/6/22369360/aaron-gordon-trade-denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic)   [Another action with Gordon’s gravity unlocking MPJ](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1376563611712229382?s=21)  [Here’s some defense](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1376559673093062657?s=21)   The team was playing with such energy and focus. They were dialed in on both ends and turning defense into offense consistently. It’s the best I’ve ever seen the nuggets look. It was beautiful basketball. Pure poetry in motion to watch.  Anyway, Murray and Barton were a big part of that. Losing them hurt us across the board, including defense"
"I wouldn’t call either of them deadweight. Little obviously has more value but I imagine any young assets would be of interest to Detroit. Collins RFA is going to be very interesting but he may be worth a flier at the right price.  I think a team like NYK could spend two firsts on CJ, especially since they have Dallas’ picks. CJ would be traded into cap space and they’d be able to afford Grant’s outgoing salary.   Apparently Detroit refused Boston’s offer of two firsts at the deadline so I think their godfather offer would be a young guy and two firsts. Aaron Gordon went for a first, a young guy and an expiring contract that could be flipped for a first. Similar value"
Aaron Gordon maybe
"I don't think the Nuggets played bad or anything, and I actually think MPJ and Aaron Gordon put up good performances, but Ayton slowed down Jokic so well and I feel like that hurt Denver so much.  Meanwhile this Suns team is absolutely firing on all cylinders and I'm just not sure how they can be beaten when the non Booker minutes are filled with absolutely play from Chris Paul. Ayton and Bridges were just absolutely dominating too. And shoutout to Booker for constantly finding the right man when he was double teamed, his 8 assists were important imo"
Not to pour cold water on you but Aaron Gordon has never score more than 20 per season in his career   I think you are over valuing his offense...
Jokic needs to be more aggressive and they need to keep feeding Aaron Gordon.  I thought Gordon did a good job on Booker but when the Suns adjusted the Nuggets didn't have an answer.  Jokic needs to go inside more. He didn't really press inside on Ayton and just played his game in the midrange &amp; outside. Which is fine for his shots but not good for his playmaking ability.
"I get that the nuggets are injured but coach Malone has killed the nuggets multiple times this year leaving out struggling lineups to start the fourth. It happened in that crazy Celtics comeback at the end of the season and his lack of adjustments just kill the team sometimes. Also, before starters were taken out there was a stretch of like four straight possessions where Jokic didn’t touch the ball, even after a commercial break. It’s cool if Aaron Gordon is making shots but there shouldn’t be three straight possessions where he holds the ball for 10+ seconds and then chucks up a shot."
Feeels like Devin Booker shouldn't be guarding Aaron Gordon.
So disappointed Aaron Gordon isn’t better.
aaron gordon aint a role player
Aaron Gordon sonned Devin Booker who sonned the Lakers  Aaron Gordon&gt;Lakers
is aaron gordon any good
I will never forgive Aaron Gordon.  Playing 2k with my created player. I finally get the start. I get us out to a 20 point lead and go out for a blow and I come back 10 down. Work to halftime to take the lead. Work 3rd to get another big lead. Go out and come back to a huge deficit. Work hard back and forth till it’s one point and we have the ball. I break ankles and notice Gordon streaking towards bucket. Hit him in stride he rises up for an uncontested game winning slam and he FUCKING misses it. I turned 2k off and never touched it again.
What double team? - Aaron gordon
Aaron “3x the charm” Gordon.
AARON “HUSTLE BONES” GORDON
Aaron Gordon has some of the freshest braids in the league.
Aaron Gordon needs a Tobi glow up. This look he’s still going with ain’t it
Aaron Gordon won't live up to being a top 5 pick but he's excelling in his role in Denver
aaron gordon has been a great addition for the nuggets
Aaron Gordon is so grateful being able to play with joker.
Welcome to the career of Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon looks like a light skin fat Nuggets Melo
Very random but I remember on hte first play of the Raptors/Magic series in 2019 Aaron Gordon tried posting up Kyle Lowry and that same thing basically happened.
"Forgot Aaron ""9/10"" Gordon plays for the nuggets."
"This is the correct answer. Portland's main problem is that CJ is not a good fit for Dame. Portland needs a wing who can play excellent defense. Aaron Gordon would be a great fit, but I doubt Denver would part with him.  CJ is overpaid, but he still has a lot of value because he is a consistent shooter who can carry a team if he gets hot. He should be tradable, especially if Portland includes a pick."
"Yeah, but what's the chances that a player like Aaron Gordon would be on the market? You can't just trade, say, an overpaid wing and a prospect for a player like that."
If Luka had MPJ for pick n pop and Aaron Gordon for pick n role he would be have similar impact. Idk feels like Mavs couldn't hit shots and Richardson who ppl thought would be difference maker didn't play at all. Ppl forget Luka didn't force shots in q4 game 6 and tried to get teammates involved but no one could hit a shot. I believe he was gassed but again teammates gotta do their own impact like game 1 and 2 to win it.
"I just watched that video Aaron Gordon did where he explained his tattoos and he's just shirtless for 10 minutes. Let's just say, I did not hear one word he said."
"Adding Aaron Gordon is such huge impact, we look much more complete with him, but lack of firepower is obvious without Murray and Barton."
"I'm not saying they dominate the game for them, but they have solid contributions from them. MPJ is averaging 19/7/2/1/ on 54/42/91. That's more than solid. You even have guys like Austin Rivers, Monte Morris, that Campezzo dude and Aaron Gordon putting in work.  Edit:  I'm not trying to discredit Jokic and/or Tatum. They're both fantastic players, if it came across as such, I'm sorry."
"Ya but Gary Trent Sr barely played with LeBron. Still, they were far apart in years.  Anyways, I don't think anybody is calling out LeBron, his statement is obviously funny and true, but it's definitely crazy that Aaron Gordon played with both Kenyons"
I'd say Aaron Gordon
"Yeah that’s some blasphemous hyperbole, Blake, Aaron Gordon, JR Smith, Westbrook, Morant.  Green definitely is an elite dunker, but come on now"
"If you play against Dad in his last year and the kid in their first year you don't have to be that old. Kenyon Sr. last played in 2015, so Aaron Gordon, for example was in the league with Kenyon Sr. and Jr. and Gordon is 25."
"Davis isn’t doing shit with that Aaron Gordon, MPJ, Austin rivers, and compazzo. That would be the worst offense in the entire playoffs. Defensively they’d be ok but to say AD shut dame down in that sweep and not Holiday and act like he’d do it again with Rivers and Compazzo is ridiculous, but think what you want to."
He is not good at posting up against anyone. I’ve seen guards defend him well in the post. What makes you think he can do better against aaron gordon or ayton?
"No kidding, Vuc is a low tier star maybe or if you hate him an amazing role player.  And Isaac being made of glass makes playing him high min impossible.  Fourniet is also a very good role player.  Aaron Gordon is a decent talent as well.  A 6th man scorer and one more scoring guard and that team is a solid 4-5seed in the east.  When those guys were still there.  I guess fultz off the bench, so maybe Norman Powell would've been a nice pickup."
Except he isn't.  I wish Charlotte fans would stop saying this.  Aaron Gordon developed big time under him.  Vuc became and All Star.  Fultz became an actual player.  Isaac developed.  Cole Anthony developed.  Chuma showed offensive growth.  Plenty of players developed under him.  Hell even Kemba did. Just because Monk sucked under him doesn't mean it was Cliffs fault.  Only Bamba flamed out under Cliff.
