marcus morris jae crowder terry rozier are better now and evan turner was never good.
"Brad Stevens has a reputation for making role players look really, really good. Evan Turner, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, the list goes on and on. His squads also have everyone buy in to the team identity and play hard-nosed defense, while getting everyone involved on offense.  He's a defense-minded coach, which is why the defensive schemes are significantly more complicated than the offense. He's already coached plenty of good offenses so far, of course he has room to improve at that end."
"Yeah, players have hit 8+ threes in the second half 16 times.   Michael Redd hit [8 in the 4th quarter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200202200MIL.html) back in 2002.  |Rk|Player|Date|Opp|MP|3P|3PA| |-:|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Chandler Parsons|2014-01-24|MEM|24|10|11| |2|Zach LaVine|2019-11-23|CHO|20|9|13| |3|Klay Thompson|2015-01-23|SAC|15|9|10| |4|Ray Allen|2002-04-14|CHH|24|8|10| |5|Buddy Hield|2019-11-25|BOS|22|8|12| |6|Jaren Jackson|2019-12-13|MIL|19|8|12| |7|Joe Johnson|2013-12-16|PHI|12|8|10| |8|Kyle Korver|2013-01-25|BOS|24|8|10| |9|Damian Lillard|2020-01-20|GSW|21|8|14| |10|Wesley Matthews|2015-12-06|WAS|22|8|11| |11|Michael Redd|2002-02-20|HOU|12|8|12| |12|Jason Richardson|2012-02-11|MIL|14|8|9| |13|Terry Rozier|2020-12-23|CLE|23|8|13| |14|J.R.

"I feel like this is only a criteria if the player is both decent and very publicly arrogant/cocky -- e.g., Terry Rozier on the Celtics, early Dennis Schröder with the Hawks (before he learned to accept being a role player with OKC)"
"&gt;ESPN’s Bobby Marks took a look at the extensions that were and weren’t handed out on Monday and offered some analysis on Ball’s situation. Marks cited a pair of recent contracts as barometers for Ball heading into contract negotiations.  &gt;“If Ball stays healthy and plays at a high level this season, a new contract should start in the $16-18 million range next offseason, similar to the Hornets’ Terry Rozier and Spurs’ Dejounte Murray (keep in mind that the $16.8 million salary this season of teammate Eric Bledsoe ranks No. 22 among all point guards). The high end for Ball would be the four-year, $80 million contract that Malcolm Brogdon signed with the Indiana Pacers in 2019.”  This was written back in November before Giannis resigned with the bucks. A lot of teams were preserving cap space for next summer and now whats left?   Its obvious that a lot of you let your emotion cloud your judgement with contracts. Your opinion on lonzo are irrelevant, if he rediscovers his 3 ball then he will be highly sought after next summer. Someone is going to pay him big money."
Free Rozier!  I love lil Terry.   Lonzo and a Nola pick to Charlotte  Rozier to Nola (he even expires with Bledsoe and Adams in the luscious summer of ‘22)  Reddick to whoever wants him.  And whatever salary and picks that team needs to offload goes to Charlotte. Bledsoe is another option that could be used here with/or Reddick
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
"I suppose it’s similar to last week when the Hornets announcer yelled after a dunk “Terry Rozier, HOW DO YOU DO??”  Konichiwa still feels off to me though for whatever reason"
Terry Rozier: 3.2/7.4 43.5%  Gordon Hayward: 2.3/5.4 42.7%
You have a 76ers flair and you’re out here listing Terry Rozier as a straight swap for Ben  Fake fan !! Lol /s
***TERRY ROZIER HOW DO YOU DO***
"you can score efficiently and still be empty stats. marcus morris with the knicks, terry rozier last year."
...Is Terry Rozier Seth Curry 2.0? Is Terry Rozier a 3 pt sniper? I always thought he was hot and hold.
"If they really want a Seth Curry version 2.0, then Terry Rozier makes perfect sense. We can just get Hardaway Jr. + WCS.   Deal works for both teams - they get their secondary playmaker and scorer to help out Luka, and we finally get a bench wing with size and a Biz replacement. This will push LaMelo to a starting spot too."
Terry Rozier has to be the most underrated player in the league this year
Terry Rozier I think
"Where did I talk about FG% in my original comment?   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/l5hmd1/on_1232021_steph_curry_passed_reggie_miller_for/gkvnbz0/  &gt;I don't think that Harden is a chucker but I don't think that TS% is a good metric to argue that point. Hypothetically, someone could be taking awful shots but they're just really good at drawing fouls.  &gt;eFG% is a better metric since it just looks at field goals. For comparison, Harden is at a career 53% eFG. Compare that to 50% eFG of Terry Rozier, who is commonly known as a chucker and 55% eFG of Kawhi, who is known for good shot selection and Curry's 58% eFG, which is just silly.  Also, you haven't defended your position on why TS% is a better metric for determining whether or not someone is a chucker. Why would TS% be a better metric than eFG% for whether someone takes bad shots?"

Terry Rozier in Cleveland
Terry Rozier.
fun fact TRoss and Terry Rozier each average 56 points per game against the Sixers
"Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, TJ Warren"
Yep he was a beast on offense. Was cooking our smaller wings and was very aggressive. Too bad devonte Graham had like 2 pts in the second half and Terry rozier had 0 in the first and lamelo ball had 5 turnovers with the game's worst -15
"Terry Rozier, Jeremy Lamb and that’s all that matters."
I miss Terry Rozier
They need more complementary role players. They should target a Terry Rozier/FvV type guard
Yeah but Terry Rozier is getting paid 10 million more if I'm not wrong
He's never been as good as people think he is. Terry Rozier is better.
"PG: 2018 Harden SG: Bradley Beal SF: 2008 Shane Battier PF: Pascal Siakam C: 2011-12 Tyson Chandler  Bench: Terry Rozier, 2013 Korver, Steven Adams  Harden and Beal can both play with or without the ball, score a ton, and run PnR with DPOY Chandler. Battier’s a great 3 and D wing, and Siakam fits well as the 3rd scoring option. Off the bench, Rozier is the 6th man, Korver adds another shooter, and Adams provides extra size/defense."
"Ah, the Terry Rozier special.   He had the exact same issue early on."
"In our 2018 Philly series, Brett Brown thought it would be a good idea to have him guard Terry Rozier, who is lightning quick. Then he put 6'3 JJ Redick (with a 6'2 wingspan) on Jayson Tatum.   To this day I'm still offended by how little player scouting they did for that series.  RoCo is a good defender when used in a very specific way. If you treat him like a small-ball PF/C like Houston did then he's fine. Yes, he gets beat off the dribble but every big does."
the hornets with terry rozier
Terry Ball / LaMelo Rozier would actually be a crazy offensive talent
"Give Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Terry Rozier and I guarantee he doesn't flame out in the second round all the while talking about he should've shot more, when he's like 2 for fucking 17. Kyrie hasn't done shit without having a top three player on his team."
"Love this last bit!     ""Look at this year. Charlotte didn’t have to do Gordon Hayward as a sign and trade. They weren’t dumping salary and still had to eat (Nicolas) Batum’s salary. But they did it because the year before, Boston helped them get Terry Rozier in the double sign and trade with Kemba Walker. That’s how you build equity and good relationships.  I think Danny has made so many deals with everyone because there’s no (expletive). No one feels like information is being withheld or that they are being lied to. That’s important in our business. You have to have trust and I trust Boston when making a trade.”"
"Not really he has made good picks such as al Jefferson, Tony Allen, Gerald green, rondo, Avery Bradley, Kelly olynky terry rozier, smart brown and Tatum. All of those players have contributed to either a championship team or multiple deep playoff runs. You’re not going to hit every draft pick and have them be a long tenure vet, but for the most part he has done a solid job at finding talent. Yes he has very questionable draft picks in the past but I would still trust him over almost any gm in league besides the raptors and maybe the warriors"
"This pretty much sums up my feelings on Ainge. He's usually done very well on the major decisions(high-end lotto picks, major trades), but some of the smaller decisions are a bit more middling. He's obviously still a damn good GM though.  Personally my only major complaint was Ainge not gunning harder for JJJ. Memphis' ownership very clearly wanted to squeeze one last playoff run out of the Conley-Gasol era, so personally I saw an opportunity to get their #4 pick.  Back before the 2018 Draft I talked to one guy who writes for Grizzly Bear Blues(Grizzlies' SB Nation Blog) about what he thought about my trade idea of Terry Rozier(remember when Scary Terry was considered a hot young commodity after that playoff run?), Marcus Morris, the return of their 1st and another 1st, and he said they likely would've heavily considered it.  Assuming that the Memphis FO would've had similar opinions, I would've gone as far as including the Kings' pick as that extra 1st. We were already having roster issues due to how many draft picks we had, I would've gladly consolidated them if it got me an uber talented and versatile young big man like JJJ to pair with Tatum and Brown."
"You obviously haven’t seen terry Rozier and Devonte graham  On a real note though, maybe Murray and White?"
"&gt;at 6’9”  That’s such a brutal way of understanding him, but also so true, he does play like he’s 6’3”. He plays like he’s no taller than Terry Rozier."
what cope fest? if you put r/sixers in charge of the team for 24 hours he'd be traded by now for Terry Rozier or some shit
Terry Rozier
Terry Rozier and Cody Zeller
Nets trade Kyrie Irving to the Hornets for Bismack Biyombo and Terry Rozier.  Who says no??
"Terry rozier is literally JR smith, the dude 100% making any contested/tough shot."

Lol  Charlotte trades Terry Rozier for Pat Beverley  Winner? OKC. They get three 1st round picks
"I'm not saying they don't have access to their own social media or the ability to post on their SM dummie. I'm saying they have someone take alot of the pictures and post alot of shit. Do I think fucking, idk, terry rozier has a SM team of course not. Lebron/giannis/steph obviously have a team that help them they are too big of brands. Bro fucking twitch streams have people who help with their SM and you don't think a person who is the face a a 100m+ dollar brand has someone helping them?"
"Because we play so many guards, it wouldn't hurt to have another.   &gt;So it'd be Kemba/Dipo to start then Pritchard/Smart off the bench. I guess Teague would be part of the trade?  Pretty much.    It would be very similar to 2017-18 where we had Kyrie/Brown and then Rozier/Smart off the bench.   Except Dipo takes Brown's spot and Brown moves up to fill the huge SF/PF hole we have right now (we're currently starting 2 C line-ups because we still haven't replaced Hayward).  &gt;I feel like something like Romeo and a 1st could get it done though.  IMO, Romeo is one of those guys we'll get laughed at for holding onto for dear life.   He's sort of our new Terry Rozier. Danny kept Rozier out of all sorts of trades even before he started playing proper minutes (he famously walked from an Ibaka trade over Rozier).   He shouldn't be considered untouchable but I think he might be. The team just sounds really excited about Romeo's potential and he's apparently one of our hardest workers."

I see them clinching the one seed but getting bounced in the first round by a spicy Terry Rozier led hornets team
"""At least I dont have to pretend to like this team anymore."" I remember the day after we were eliminated, I told one of my buddies that. Kyrie, Morris, hell even Terry Rozier was wearing out his welcome. It was such a relief it was over."
Throwback to when the 18-19 Celtics blew out the Sixers on opening night despite Kyrie and Hayward playing like shit. People were saying Tatum was the best player on the team (not true at the time) and called Terry Rozier the front-runner for 6MOY.
"Oh I wasn’t even counting Rozier. In my eyes it’s Hayward, Graham/Ball, Ball/Graham and then Rozier. I wasn’t even considering Terry. So if Graham is consensus #2. Give me Lamelo. I’m taking a swing on potential there"
Terry Rozier would like a word
Every team would want to spend their max contract for KD. But when those stars are taken and you still have a lot of salary to spend then you start to gamble. Hayward played like he was top 100 player last year but you know he used to be allstar. So you take that bet and hope he turns into Utah Hayward. I think it was same for the Terry Rozier too. Overpaid or not Hornets were able to get those 2 without giving any significant asset was a good business for them. They play a better basketball. Its a better product to the sell ther fanbase and develop their young prospects
Hayward and Lamelo are out to prove all the doubters wrong and I'm loving it as well as this Hornets team. Only one I don't like is Terry Rozier but I guess he's alright
"Marcus Smart can ""get hot like Duncan Robinson"" in the same way Terry Rozier can ""get hot like Kyrie Irving"". Sure, maybe for like a full quarter four times a season, but that's hardly even worth mentioning"
Hayward has 28 at the half. All the while with Terry Rozier on his team who went on ESPN saying Hayward was taking his shots on the Celtics.
"Idk about funny but I call Terry Rozier, Terry Rozycheeks."
Did Brad Stevens &amp; Terry Rozier bail the NBA out from a potential Celtics' dynasty?

"the problem is, who do you bench?  Terry's shooting is very valuable.  Devontae is the fan bases love child.  Me being a huge Terry fan that choice is simple, but going back all offseason 95% of Hornets fans were pleading to bench Rozier and start Melo and Graham.  Now things are very muddled.  80% of fans want to start Melo, 70% want to start Rozier, 60% want to start Graham.  It's all super fucky.  I'm sticking true to my view from 2 months ago; bring in Graham off the bench."
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
Graham and Terry are fine.  Lamelo and Terry as a backcourt is so much more effective than Rozier/Graham.
Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward
Never gonna forgive Terry Rozier for not pulling the trigger on that open 3 to give Melo his 10th assist in Ball Bowl I
Stop lol. He got a lot of opportunities. He just got injured at the wrong times. Terry Rozier was upset because Hayward was getting so many opportunities and he thought he was better than him.
Some day we’ll laugh about how Terry Rozier kept Lamelo on the bench in his first season lol
"It’s a point meant to emphasize how bulk shooting can increase bulk numbers, while not giving the context of efficiency.   Luka shot 8.8 3’s per game last year at a 31.1% clip, giving him a total of 171 total 3’s made.   Terry Rozier shot 6.8 3’s per game at a 40.4% clip, giving him a total of 172 total 3’s made.  Obviously Luka is the better player. Saying “Luka made one less 3 than Terry Rozier last year” without giving the context would be disingenuous, whether on purpose or not."
"Terry is playing great, though. He needs to be starting next to Melo.   I really like when Charlotte has Melo - Rozier - Hayward - Bridges - PJ on the court. That's a legitimately good lineup. I believe in PJ as the small ball center against most teams that don't have a dynamic big.  I'd bring Graham off the bench as your backup point who can get hot from three."
Last two 1st rd point guards: Terry Rozier (16th) and Rondo (21st) and only other small guard being Avery Bradley (18th) who's an undersized SG...    If you mean Carsen Edwards and Waters...  they're in their 2nd season and second round picks w/ Waters 51st. Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird were 53rd and 56th picks. So yeah late 2nd round guards (or any position) very rarely translate--for any team. Meanwhile Ainge actually has a very good return on the two or three mid/late 1st rd 6'2 and under PG guards he's drafted.
"Comparing the two seasons is absolutely insane. They’re in no way comparable.    - 2019 Lakers coming off 35 win season  Their 5 best players missed a combined 140 games in 2019  Lebron missed 27 games   Ingram missed 30 games  Lonzo missed 35 games  Kuzma missed 12 games  Rondo missed 36 games  - 2019 Celtics coming off a 55 win season and trip to ECF   Their 8 best players only missed a combined 62 games  Kyrie missed 15 games  Tatum missed 3 games  Horford missed 14 games  Brown missed 8 games   Morris missed 7 games   Smart missed 2 games   Hayward missed 10 games  Rozier missed 3 games   Its just not even a comparison. Kyrie imploded a fantastic team with insane amounts of talent. Terry Rozier was like the 8th best player on that team. Lebron and everyone else got hurt, and then the kids rebelled when they hear they might be traded.   They just aren’t comparable implosions at all"
"Nah it wasn't tampering, no fines were laid lol. Kyrie bad mouthed his teammates to the media after playing sht, Terry Rozier and Jaylen brown talk and about Kyrie, and Draymond went on All the Smoke podcast and said KD ruined the Warriors lockeroom after he got jealous of LeBron lol  LeBron's cool with everyone, Kyrie and KD are bust jealous and toxic lol. You probably weren't even a fan of theirs before they joined lol, stop this nonsense, it's well known their toxic."
"Bucks depth? Last year for sure, but a lot has changed. Are their first 3 off the bench in the playoffs going to be Augustin, Forbes, and Portis? Nets look good on paper in that regard, but they really need another PG to run their second unit.   Miami and Indiana look like the deepest teams in the East to me. I agree that Morey will need to make a move for another ball handler by the deadline Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose, Patty Mills, George Hill, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon come to mind as potential fits if they become available."
Lol Terry Rozier didn't even know that Jordan 3 peated twice. Like I know he was born after the Bulls dynasty but c'mon you gotta know that if your in the NBA and play for the fking Hornets
LaMelo  PJ Washington   Miles Bridges  Jalen McDaniels  Terry Rozier  Devonte Graham  Cody Zeller
"Replace him with a league average Pg like Terry Rozier and they’d win plenty of games. Definitely not playoffs worthy, but not worst team in the league."
"Terry Rozier was great against the bucks, but I hate him now because he shot 0-10 in the ECF Game 7 and then bitched for the entirety of next year because he thought he was better than Kyrie"
"I feel like you could bring Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes off the bench and they still wouldn’t win."
"I'm not saying it's impossible, but 41+% on 8.5 shots a game is like Duncan Robinson/Buddy Hield/Davis Bertans level shooting. It would be one of the most impressive shooting leaps ever (Terry wasn't considered a shooter coming out of college) and Rozier isn't exactly that young (he's almost 27).    Again I wouldn't rule it out, but I would reasonably expect some level of shooting regression. I still think he's going to be a high level NBA 3 point shooter. The difference between 39% and 41% is going to be like 6 makes so it's probably not worth splitting that many hairs about it."
Terry Rozier was the last pick in my fantasy draft and his scoring has gotten me 2 wins so far
Terry rozier
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."

Terry Rozier is back to scary terry form
What did the city of Philadelphia do to terry rozier to deserve his unending wrath
It’s going to be weird seeing Terry Rozier finishing 5th in MVP voting at the end of the season. Dollar store Dame is playing out of his mind this season
Terry Rozier is a terrorist
I want to live in a world where I'm not terrorized by Terry Rozier
"&gt;Dude are you really arguing Terry Rozier is better than Kyrie Irving?   Where in any of my comments did I say that, you troglodyte?   &gt;Chemistry was an issue the next year, but that year they were still in the honeymoon phase. Boston fans and the team still loved Kyrie in 17-18.  Ok... irrelevant to what we're talking about  &gt;Terry Rozier in the playoffs averages 9.8/4/3.3 on .393/.335/.809. Kyrie averages 23.5/3.3/5 on .453/.398/.879 in the playoffs. How are they even remotely comparable as players?  Never said Rozier was better, but that the fit was better. That's evident with the fact the Celtics had more wins in 2018 and went farther in the playoffs  You can be a worse player than another but be a better fit. Ben Simmons would be a better starting PG than Kentavius Caldwell-Pope, but he'd probably be a bit worse fit on the Lakers considering the way our lineup is built and our system is.  This point has been argued to the point of irrelevancy.  Trying to bait me into saying Rozier &gt; Kyrie, when I never even implied that, is an attempt to get me off topic. The 18 Celtics were better, full stop."
"Dude are you really arguing Terry Rozier is better than Kyrie Irving? Chemistry was an issue the next year, but that year they were still in the honeymoon phase.

"He isn’t as good as he was at protecting the rim. He still a great defensive player, but one could argue that Kevin Durant was the best defensive player in the NBA his last two seasons.  Terry Rozier and PJ Washington wouldn’t have dared to dunk on Kevin Durant if he was still an elite rim protector.   I still think Kevin Durant will be the best player in the NBA again... give it 3 months."
wish he was on the hornets so he'd be saying this shit about terry rozier or somethin instead
I’m 90% sure that the warriors will not trade steph curry and James wiseman for terry rozier and Cody zeller
He could play the 3 too which we have no depth at. But this would still be stupid cause we have so many 20 ppg scoring threats on our roster with melo monk rozier hayward terry and Fournier if this happens but still no defense.
"I believe the Vuc rumor, not the Fournier rumor. I'm not sure what purpose Fournier serves when you already have Terry Rozier, Devonte' Graham, Malik Monk with that same kind of skillset. We need a center and a bigger defensive wing.  Also, as bad as it sounds, we are like 0 for 3 on acquiring French veterans in their primes. It never works out for us lol. 0-4 if you include drafting Alexis Ajinca in the first round in 08."
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn’t have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year’s. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte’ Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We’ve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he’s definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he’s still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We’re still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we’re young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we’ve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
"They are exactly in a position to fill need? They are in contention for 4-5 seed, with great guard play, an all star caliber wing, and depth everywhere but c, yes Mitch said they aren’t in that position to fill need before the draft but ALOT has changed since then, lamelo turned out to be a steal and potential super star, we signed Gordon Hayward, terry rozier broke out, and we planted ourselves clearly in the playoff picture. There is no need to trade for ball if he really wants to play with his brother he can join In the offseason without costing assets"
kuzma (chaos)  kevin love (i think he's engaged but he looks like every bachelor ever)  terry rozier (all-nba best smile)  raul neto (self explanatory)
"Signing a competent GM, drafting LaMelo instead of trading the pick or doing something crazy, giving Terry Rozier a 3 yr/$54 million contract when everyone thought it was insane, letting Kemba walk instead of crippling us with a max, drafting really well for the past three drafts (including several second rounders in our rotation), being the greatest basketball player ever"
"I'll throw out a few names. C. Wood if he comes back and plays like he did pre-injury. Terry Rozier at least in the convo imo. Maybe Julius Randle. Mikal Bridges if defense was valued as much as offense though his offense has also improved. Lonzo because free throws and more threes? Chris Boucher? Trent Jr? Richaun Holmes? Long way of saying no, right now Grant seems like a lock."
What’s the selling price for Terry Rozier?

Terry Rozier though Dame will get more attention.
Terry was ASS in Boston aside from that purple patch in the 2018 playoffs. We're very lucky he completely reinvented himself. Devonte' Graham blowing up last year and forcing Rozier to be an off the ball shooter is the best thing that could have happened to him.
"Nicolas Batum has made more money to do less work than Terry Rozier. Now you tell me again, who actually is living the American Dream?"
terry rozier is a fucking beast
[Terry Rozier said it best](https://twitter.com/certifiedceltic/status/1366841948779216900?s=21)
"&gt;It begs a question - are Duncan Robinson, Paul George, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Joe Harris less known or have they all been simply unavailable for the 3PT competition?     Joe Harris already won the 3pt competition before and has been outspoken about being against this years All-star weekend. I'm sure he got invited but declined it"
"It was a team composed of elite defenders like Terry rozier, Carmelo Anthony, enes knater, and a few other guys who I forgot"
"How many Terry Rozier, Myles Turner, or Danny Ainge posts are we gonna see between now &amp; are next game?  😴"
"Giannis got destroyed in the first round to the trash bulls, couldn’t even beat the trash bros raptors back court in the first round, lost to rookie Jason tatum and Terry rozier in the first round, got sonned  by kawhi and blew a 2-0 lead losing 4-2, 4 Ls in a row, then his fraud 1 seed got swept by the 5th."
G - Terry Rozier   G - DJ Augustin   F - Carmelo Anthony   F - Michael Porter Jr.  C - Enes Kanter
Terry Rozier......
"I got shit on for saying this when he was sent to Charlotte. I said I'd rather have him plus additional pieces instead of Kyrie.   Rozier is on the same timeline as J&amp;J, the rest of the team seemed to like him, his price tag was way way lower and he was a much better defender and more durable.  That's not the same as saying Rozier is better than Kyrie. But the team as a whole may have been better off with Rozier and the additional pieces they could have gotten with Kyrie's money. It's possible for a team to be better with a less talented player who fits the rest of the team than with a more talented player that the rest of the team can't stand and who doesn't play D.  Also, kudos to Terry Rozier. Dude has clearly been working on his game and is having a great season."
"I don’t think the problem was that people thought Terry wasn’t good enough. We needed someone that could be a 3/4 fiddle and it seems he wanted to be more of a primary scorer. Rightfully so, look at his performance in Charlotte. I think fit wise it worked out better for both. Boston has a problem with our playmaking. We don’t necessarily need raw scoring output. If Rozier is on a team with Tatum, he’s not able to score the same way."
"WTH with this nonsense.   First off, Terry is playing shooting guard, not PG. This has made all the difference for him. Big credit to him and the coaching staff for helping him evolve into an elite and \*efficient\* shotmaker.   Second, Terry is playing below average defense. His reputation as a tough defender has followed him, but he is inconsistent on ball, and consistently misplaced off ball.   Third, everyone knows this wasn't Terry for Kemba. It was the Hornets failing to find a good trade for Kemba when they knew they wouldn't be able to (or want to?) resign him. This was a sign Kemba, then, ok here we'll do a sign and trade let's make something work.   Fourth, it was a (calculated) overpay at the time. Some say it's because the Suns targeted Terry (who honestly would have been a nice fit alongside Booker). For those who foresaw Terry improving this much, not to mention the emergence of Devonte Graham last year to take over PG alongside him, credit to you, not discredit to those who dared doubt the gambling overpay. That said, Terry Rozier is a badass and I'm glad to have him.  Fifth, Kemba went to the Celtics, and now he is injury prone. This is part of the Curse of Isaiah Thomas (see also Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving) and what they get for cutting a dude who gave his heart, soul and body to that team in one of the NBA's most legendary single-season performances, but had the nerve to get hurt while playing on a shitty contract. They should have resigned and rehabbed him, but they dumped him on the street for Kyrie. Endure it, Ainge."
"Could you imagine a team with the Jays, Hayward, Kyrie, and prime Horford? And with guys like Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams coming off the bench? That team would win at least one championship"
"LaMelo, best combo of size/shooting/skill out of the three. He’s been playing behind Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier who have been killing it this year but is still putting up really good numbers for a rookie."
"1 game sample sizes are how you end up with hot takes like Terry Rozier for MVP. Also, Simmons got most of that while Gobert was on the bench. Can't be that good at guarding the rim if you're taking a break I guess. 🙄🙄"
Too bad he couldn’t give up Terry Rozier
"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
"Go back to those threads, lots of people saying Danny’s a genius because we got superstar Kemba without giving up assets and allowed MJ to overpay for the awful Terry Rozier"
"“I see lebron James, Draymond green, Candace Parker, and other prominent figures about how book got snubbed.”  Yet I will continue on and say that terry rozier and Gordon Hayward are better than him. Maybe you should consider that dudes like lebron James and draymond green know what they are talking about."
"When did I say that he wasn’t a really good player? Marcus Smart is a really good player, Terry Rozier is a really good player, you don’t even make sense."
Except the Hornets were going to lose Kemba for nothing and the Celtics stepped up to help them get Terry Rozier as a show of good faith.   We could have signed Kemba and let Terry find another team.   It was never a fleece nor was it intended to be one. It's like saying Indiana fleeced Milwaukee by giving them a pick as a show of good faith when they signed Brogdon.
"Seems like this is becoming a theme in the last couple NBA games. Terry Rozier buzzer beater 3, Luka Doncic buzzer beater 3, and now Dort."
"bro imagine being a suns fan and somehow think you got fucked this game lmao! holy shit..... get real people. literally just off the top of my head.... lamelo getting tackled by 2 dudes shooting a 3 in the end of the first quarter, no call. miles bridges fouled on a putback dunk attempt no free throws, terry rozier scraped in the face no call, lamelo ball getting slapped in the face no call, egregious carry by chris paul directly in front of the ref no call, booker elbowing hayward in the face and getting rewarded, ball going out on saric and giving you the ball at the end of the game........ ok thats just off the top of my head"
"Lol Suns mad at not getting a call after getting hella calls all night.   Let's call this one even for the Terry Rozier no call when he got hit in the eye. Or the no call on Melo at the end of the 1st. Or the no call on Monk's ""tech"".   Buzz Buzz"
Mike Conley  Terry Rozier
Terry Rozier over Kevin Durant. Maybe LaMelo over Giannis but it’s sorta a tossup.
Terry Rozier now is a better player now than Dlo ever was.
"So Terry Rozier must be a starter then, right?"
This came up last weekend for the Hornets.   A surprising about of Warriors fans decided to be upset about the team and announcers being pumped when Terry Rozier hit the game winner. It's like waving a giant banner around telling everyone exactly how mad you are that your boys lost. Very strange.
"He’s not a bum and does get overlooked too much imo, but as everyone has said he’s injured a lot, and quite frankly his scoring isn’t overly impressive in today’s era. KP is putting up 20.5 PPG this year. Terry Rozier is putting up 20.8."
"“Quarterfinals of the playoffs” is a fancy way to say “first round exit” not to mention Hayward played 72 games to get himself back to normal.   Hilarious how you refuse to admit a single thing negative about the team, even though they still were stockpiled in assets and had a player like Terry Rozier upset with his Role, wanting to leave in free agency, and tons of picks to toss on with him to get an upgrade or another player on the roster.   But yeah I don’t know expect someone who calls an embarrassing 1st round exit “making the quarter finals” to be objective"
"It leaks into the supporting cast because people watch the games and see the guys play.  No one is talking about the role players on Bulls or Pistons.  Look at Caruso last year, THT this year -- people only know them because the Lakers are good and get the coverage because of Lebron.  Same thing for the Nets this year.    Look at Terry Rozier this year -- he's putting up historically great stats as well, ~21ppg on 50/45/80.  I see nothing about Rozier on this sub, ever.  All CLT press is about LaMelo...  I think the last time I even saw the guy mentioned was when he was playing for Boston.  Big market/big name teams get more attention and the other guys benefit."
"There’s a universe where Kyrie stays if Celtics traded away Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier who had gotten inflated egos from the ECF run the Celtics had and were playing selfishly that whole season.   Another example of Ainge’s excellent GM skills. Kept 7 shot creators, half of which were contributing to locker room problems, at the deadline when he could have traded some of them away."
"I just said that he couldn’t have done much better lol. He did lose them for nothing though, and the Terry Rozier/Kemba situation seems to have been botched in retrospect, even though at the time it seemed like a big win. I’m still out on that call for now though."
"Need scoring from the bench and to get rid of Danny Green if possible, his only reedemign quality was his defense and it has fallen off a cliff. Something like Terry Rozier or Lowry would be lovely, idc if we'd have to give Maxey and picks"
"LMAOOOO theres at least 10 guards that have been better this season. You Westbrick stans are hilarious  &amp;#x200B;  Harden, Beal, Kyrie, Ben, Jaylen, Brogdon, Trae, Lavine, FVV, Jrue and Lowry have all been better at least.  &amp;#x200B;  Westbrick hasnt even been much better than Terry Rozier if at all."
"Ainge traded Terry Rozier, who is playing lights out, for Kemba, who is playing like trash, so I’m not understanding the multiple comments here excusing Ainge because Kemba doesn’t look good?!?"
"Hey, how about Ainge developing and locking Terry Rozier in as a Celtic for life. Have to give him credit for that.....   Oh, wait......."
I didn't like the Kemba trade when it happened and I still don't. I rather have retained Terry Rozier and gotten a better big than TT.
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
U forgot terry rozier
Carlisle is the head of the Coaches organization. He has to stand up for them. Let’s not act like bringing on Leon Rose didn’t change the trajectory of the Knicks. They were about to trade Julius Randle for Terry Rozier.
"Terry Rozier went off, actually"
"i see your argument. but on a basic level, the goal is to get a good shot, right? having a ""floor general"" in and of itself doesn't accomplish that if he can't force the defense to react to him, thus getting someone else open. i think the common trend among great teams is not that they have, like, a pass-first PG player, but rather that they have elite offensive players in general, and part of what it means to be an elite offensive player is passing/playmaking.  in other words, i would love to have lowry on this team, but that's because he's a great player. getting a mediocre ""floor general"" like terry rozier or something wouldn't help because you don't want to take the ball out of Kawhi or PG""s hands anyway."
Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier baby
"Terry rozier on this Celtics  team makes a huge difference, huge mistake. They lost rozier and Hayward to the hornets"
Terry “fuck r/nba” Rozier
I love the amount of Celtics fans in here. I have the Scary Terry Shirt Bleacher Report made after the confetti game against the 76ers and I loved watching Rozier in Boston but I’m even happier now for him now that he’s out there in Charlotte ballin out
"I’ve watched McLaurin fry my team entirely since he was drafted. Rozier is very good too, but Scary Terry belongs to McLaurin"
Terry Rozier and Kyle Anderson should both be in the discussion IMO.
This is revisionist history to the finest. There was a topic two years ago saying what is the worst contract in the NBA and the top voted/most given answer was Terry Rozier
"“THE REASON YA’LL SHOULD FEAR, TERRY ROZIER!” 😤😤"
"Terry Rozier is such an underrated player, I bet half the people here don't even know who he is. he's averaging 21.1 ppg for feck sake"
Terry Rozier didn't win the game off a free throw.  Fake fan.  Gtfo.  You disgrace the flair
I'm sorry you don't get excited watching Terry Rozier sink two beauts to tie up the game with 9 seconds left. Must be a boring life
"Hornets fucking obliterated the trade.  Those homers on r/bostonceltics don’t want to admit that Rozier is just a much better player to have than Kemba at this point in their careers. You get called a hater just for calling out how bad a fit Kemba is with the Jays.   A lot of them want Terry to fail solely so they can get an “I told you so” moment for Kemba but it’s the other way around. IDGAF though, Terry is still someone we drafted and will always want to see him do well."
Terry rozier. HE THE PUT THE TEAM ON HIS MUDDAFUCKIN BACK DOE
Terry Rozier is an enigma
PSA:  The game winner was made by Terry Rozier.
"Thunder/Bucks  Raptors/Timberwolves   Warriors/Hornets (until Terry Rozier caught on fire)  Heat/Lakers  Over the past 24 hours, all four of these games either finished with neither team reaching 100 points, or were on pace for neither team reaching 100 points. These four games make it feel like we're in the midst of a mini resurgence of mid/late 2000s basketball and the nostalgia trip is really vibing with me ngl"
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Terry Rozier. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Terry. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"Terry rozier is actually as good as Terry rozier thinks he is?  Also op this clip is too long, I can just barely identify who shot it on my second watch"
"Ok I haven't watched it yet. My prediction is that EC says ""OH MY GOODNESS, TERRY ROZIER"" after he hits the shot. Will update when I have watched it"
Is Terry Rozier better than prime Tracy McGrady? Is Terry Rozier a Hall of Famer? Did the Celtics mess up by trading Terry Rozier? Should Giannis have signed with Charlotte to play next to Terry Rozier and LaMelo Ball?    Just trying to prepare myself to sort by new over the next couple hours.
TERRY ROZIER HOW DO YOU DO!!!!
They didn’t lol.  They also missed two 4 point plays for Terry Rozier and a foul against PJ Washington.
"TERRY ROZIER, HOW DO YOU DO!"
TERRY  ROZIER  HOW  DO  YOU  DOOOOO
"Warriors up 8. Terry Rozier hits 3 of the most insane shots you’ve ever seen, Oubre also with an insane 3 for the Warriors in between.   Warriors up 2 with the ball with the clock running down. They miss a shot with 12 seconds left, and LaMelo and a Warriors player jump on it, jump ball. Scrappy jump ball, Heyward grabs it and falls down, and Draymond reached down to grab it too. But they awarded the Hornets the timeout first... and here’s where it gets crazy. Draymond does what he always does and mouths off. So the refs give him a technical or maybe a double technical and he gets ejected.   So the hornets get 2 free throws. Rozier hits both. Then they get the ball back and Terry hit what can only be described as one of the most inanely off balance flying through the air prayer shots of all time, but he was on FIRE. So he hit it as the clock buzzed and the Hornets win.   My mind is still processing, what a treat.   Draymond Green is BIG angry and"
"What a game. Terry Rozier killed it. Sucks that would have been the game tying shot, instead of the winner, if Draymond could have chilled. But the Hornets earned that win anyway. Rozier dropping ""shit"" like twice in that post-game interview, haha."
"That's poetic justice. Not to mention the refs were letting the Warriors get away with everything. Oubre blatantly fouling rozier on a 3 that he STILL made to cut the deficit to 1. Imagine if he had missed that shot and the refs didn't call a foul, the hornets woulda been defending down 4 instead of down 1. Hornets deserve this win after all the bs calls the refs were making. Scary Terry clutch"
Terry Rozier &gt; Steph Curry

Nah we couldn't see Terry Rozier from this angle
TERRY ROZIER HOW DO YOU DO
We got absolutely dunked on for the money we paid Terry Rozier and all he's doing is carrying this team on his back lately.
Terry Rozier.
Terry rozier was fouled like 3 times on his 3 pointers
"We can talk about how much of a clown Draymond is....  But instead, Terry Rozier is an absolute hooper."
TERRY FUCKING ROZIER!!!
Well damn. Good job to Terry Rozier.
"He feels like the type of player that is better when he plays starter minutes, like he needs more minutes to get into a flow. I remember that being true of Terry Rozier when he was with us, he was much better in games that he started rather than when he had to try and come off the bench and be a microwave scorer.   Whenever Lowry has been out, and you play that FVV/Powell/OG/Siakam/Boucher 5, he's been doing work."
"not just this, extending Bledsoe BEFORE the playoffs even began, hamstringing their flexibility to keep a player who had already choked and embarrassed himself in the playoffs the year before (see: Terry Rozier/Drew Bledsoe saga) and proceeded to choke and embarrass himself in both subsequent playoffs"
"&gt; I wouldn't really consider that ""outplaying"" anyone when it's not like he went off during his minutes. He was good on defense though I guess ill give him that.  Right, because you're looking at mostly Romeo's scoring. We put him on [LeBron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVW2zzd_L4k) and [Harden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlLxf50L81Y)...   We had a rookie, who had barely any experience in the NBA due to missing time with injuries, guarding LeBron James and James Harden last season. On a team that already had Smart, Brown, Tatum and Hayward as defensive options.   That's promising.  &gt;Romeo was not promising. 2.5 ppg on 35 FG% and 18 3p% is absolutely atrocious.  And Terry Rozier averaged 1.8 on 22/29 splits and Avery Bradley averaged 1.7 on 34/0 splits.   Our team regularly relegates rookies to empty offensive roles. It doesn't mean they aren't showing promise.   You have to actually watch these guys play. You can't just camp the boxscores."
"So you just ignored everything I said 😂it’s his fault that Terry Rozier wants more shots? It was never going to work when they made it to the ECF without him... they made it in a weak ass East bro, they were in the conference finals with a Cavs team that didn’t even have a shot at winning the championship. Because of that they all got huge egos. That’s Kyries fault? They probably could’ve made it to the finals and challenged golden state WITH kyrie considering kyrie led them to 41-16 that year. Boston was not better without him. You want to point out the 2018-19 season numbers saying they were “better” without him? The teams they beat were under .500... youre judging  him too harshly"
Terry Rozier after the 2018 Conference Finals
Going for the deepest team cuz I’m building the team on 2k with no injuries and gonna see how it goes!  Starters: PG: John Wall ($15) SG: Klay Thompson ($16) SF: Demar Derozan ($13) PF: Christian Wood ($13) C: Nikola Vucevic ($17  Bench: PG: Terry Rozier ($6) SG: Collin Sexton ($14) SF: Andrew Wiggins ($9) PF: Julius Randle ($6) C: Clint Capela ($9)  Roster Fillers: Kevin Knox: ($1) Isaiah Thomas: ($1)
"Except it's not the most important factor. The explosion in three point attempts and the increase in the average guard's skill is the main factor. Second tier guards like Terry Rozier and CJ McCollum were not nearly as effective on offence ten years ago because they were not launching 7-8 threes per game at 38%+. Similarly, if Steph Curry had played 20 years ago and had his 10-12 3PAs cut in half, he'd be a far less effective offensive weapon."
"According to Rozier, they had a system they’d talk about in practice and kyrie wouldn’t follow it. Still partially on Brad for not being able to make it work (Terry also said that) but everyone discounts what Terry and Mook said about what happened."
PG: Terry Rozier   SG: Aron baynes  SF: Jason Tatum  PF: Marcus Morris   C: Al Horford  They destroyed us that entire season
"I think a part of this is how much turnover there was a in a span of a few years. In hindsight a lot of those guys should’ve been moved for assets, but at the time we were trying to compete around Kyrie and that wouldn’t have made any sense back then.  Now they’re in a position where they need to develop players again to either use as trade pieces to bring in veteran talents like the ones you mentioned who left better than they came or develop into rotational guys to keep for some time like we did with players like Terry Rozier or Avery Bradley.   That can’t happen right away, so we came into this season without much wiggle room because guys had to step up — some guys did, but mostly it’s been a mixed bag with improvements in some parts of guys’ games and regression in others. That hasn’t been helped by a ton of games lost to Covid and injuries which has made it harder for the team to find a consistent rhythm and pecking order. With the lack of wiggle room and the degree to which things went to shit after a hot start it’s not shocking the team is struggling."
"*checks notes*  Yes, the Celtics have indeed lost Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris in the last 5 years. Great observation man"

Rob Williams - Terry Rozier jersey swap at the end there? Iconic.
Terry Rozier taking 43 shots tonight gonna be the best game of the weekend.
"&gt; 4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all.  If Nash tried to double the number of 3s he takes, then defenses would play him differently and prevent him from taking that many 3s. Nash has to focus on running on offense more than trying to take 9.4 3s a game. He'd shoot more 3s, like 7-8, but not 9.4 lol. And even shooting that many more 3s he wouldn't be averaging some of the ridiculous points I see on this thread.  &gt; single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now  Van vleet has a faster shot release and doesn't have playmaking responsibilities like Nash would have.  &gt; Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier  All of those guys, aside from Lonzo, aren't the playmaking point guards of their team who have to run the offense like Nash has to.   &gt; If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game   He wouldn't, because the only guys taking them are Steph, Dame, and Buddy Hield."
"4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all. I’ve seen almost every single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he’s averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now and is NOT that great of a shot creator, taking ill advised shots is one of his worst qualities.   Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier all average 8-9 three point attempts a game. If think fucking Steve Nash can’t attempt 9.4 or more in today’s game then you are flat out misinformed and either never watch Nash play, don’t watch modern basketball or both."
If this question gets asked after ben has a few good games its different answers.  If it's asked after a few bad games most of rnba would take Terry rozier over ben. Ben is one of the most hated players lol. Every GM would take Ben in a millisecond
It is though. There are guys who rack up assists who don’t score as much like Chris Paul who are considered better offensive players than a guys like Terry Rozier and Malik Beasley even though they are averaging 20 a game.
OH MY TERRY ROZIER HOW DO YOU DO
"Hornets fans have a ton to be excited about tho ? They literally have one of the most promising players in the league locked in, a solid team and a blossoming Terry Rozier"
"Starter: **Mark Blount**  *Honorable mention: Ricky Davis*  -  Regular bench rotation guy: **Phil Pressey** (hard to believe there was a season where undrafted rookie Phil Pressey played 15 mpg over 75 games and started 11 times)  *Honorable mentions: Semi Ojeleye, Jeff Teague, Orien Greene, Sebastian Telfair*  -  End-of-bench guy with only a few minutes here and there: **Tremont Waters**  *Honorable mentions: Carsen Edwards, Guershon Yabusele, rookie Terry Rozier, rookie Avery Bradley*"
"Rozier is playing amazing, are you kidding?  He's miles better than Kemba right now.  Rozier:  20.5/4.0/3.4 on .475/.417/.837  Kemba:  18.3/3.6/4.7 on .395/.350/.937 and can't stay on the court because of injuries.  Getting Terry Rozier in a sign and trade was one of the only decent things the Hornets have done in the last decade, the Celtics would be better off if they'd held onto him instead of going after Kemba."
Terry Rozier. Amazing shooter but is terrible on defense.
IT and Terry Rozier on the same team (again).
"Yeah because you're looking at his season stats without understanding the context behind them.   Terry Rozier developed a lot in Boston and then added to that in Charlotte.   He broke out in 2017-18 and was the starting PG on a team that got within 1 game of the finals. You can track it via the numbers if you want:  * 2017-18: His break out came off the back of the game slowing down for him and his improved 3pt game opening up the floor.  Terry used to average 30% from 3, this season he starts averaging 38%.   His game was still inconsistent because when that 3 wasn't falling he didn't have much else to fall back on. It also led to him being pretty inefficient.  * 2018-19: Then Kyrie and Hayward come back and he loses his role. This has a huge impact on his game and his 3P shooting because he's a rhythm player and being pushed down the rotation throws off his rhythm.     At this point, you're looking at his stats and accepting them blindly as proof of his talent. What you're not seeing is that in a limited role, he struggles to find his shots and he ends up forcing a lot of shots. That has an incredibly negative impact on his stats. Even though his shooting ability has improved, he's back to shooting really poorly from 3.   In games he's coming off the bench he looks really bad. When he starts he looks pretty good.   Although it's not all bad news. His FG% within 0-3ft jumps from 53% to 63% as it's clearly a point of emphasis he's worked to improve on.   Then he goes to Charlotte where his 3P shooting has rebounded (because he once again has a green light) and then some, he's clearly worked on it a little more. Plus you're getting his improved finishing around the rim (61% for the season).  The only big new area of his game is his midrange pull-up. He's never really been high volume in the mid-range but he's starting to shoot it pretty well."
"This, Terry Rozier regressed a bit from his 3rd to his 4th season, but he was pretty awful when he got here. He averaged .326 TS his rookie season and .466 his sophomore season. He's continued to improve since he went to Charlotte, especially since they basically have switched him to become mostly an off-ball shooter, but Rozier got a lot better from start to finish in Boston. Outside of that one dip from year 3 to 4 he's pretty much linearly improved his whole career."
"Terry Rozier on fire is a crazy. He doesn't go insane too often, but when he does, he's everywhere on the court, in the right place at the right time."
"He'll make an uncontested mid range jumper against 6'1 Terry Rozier and people will say ""was lmA JUSt pr3TeNDING TO bE wASheD/?//???"""
Terry Rozier but he’s liven up to it
"Such as making it to the ECF with a line up of   IT, Bradley, Crowder, Amir Johnson, and Al Horford  and pushed LeBron to 7 in the ECF  Terry Rozier, sophomore Jaylen Brown, rookie Jayson Tatum, Marcus Morris and Al Horford.  Which of those is ""less with more""?"
i thought terry rozier is on that list for sure. Mf was clutch as shit every time i saw him play
i'd rather Terry Rozier than Fred
You mean the year Terry Rozier took them to the ECF (game 7 too) while Kyrie was out during the playoffs? The next year Kyrie came back and they got destroyed by the Bucks in the ECSF.
I could've sworn Terry Rozier would be on this list
"From a Hornets perspective, I’d trade Miles Bridges with either Terry Rozier or Gordon Hayward.   The amount of firsts and the protection on those firsts I am unsure over. I’d start with this years first and then proceed to the bargaining table."
Terry Rozier scoring in the clutch + Eric Collins losing his mind. Name a more iconic duo

"Tbh the Rozier &amp; Hayward contracts aren’t looking bad rn... especially the Terry one, man carries us to the promised land EVERY game"
Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier BONKED the Washington Wizards
"Rondo *(technically)*, Terry Rozier, Avery Bradley"
"What? Lost Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Kyrie Irving, Marcus Morris, and Gordon Hayward. That's a playoff starting 5 in the east"
"Yea Blake, LA and Drummond would’ve all helped the hornets this season but to trade for them they would’ve had to include either terry rozier or Hayward which made trading for 1 pointless"
Terry Rozier
"Lol wish I could watch this Birdzier player, but I’ll settle for normal Terry Rozier. It looks like Charlotte won the Kemba/Terry sign and trade swap, and they were universally panned for it at the time.  Terry is by far one of the most underrated players in the league, but having LaMelo on the team has helped and will help get Terry that exposure in the future.   If Charlotte gets a big man in the draft (trade up for Mobley maybe?), they’ll be a legitimate great team in a year or two. Melo-Terry-Hayward-Mobley would be a great core of guys who complement each other very well."
Terry Rozier about to go off on us I'm scared
"They also have PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, Terry Rozier, and Malik Monk. Not saying they have a better future, I’m just saying they’re the only team you guys have competition with for that title"
Gorgui  might as well get used to spelling it since Terry Rozier tweeted the eyes emoji
"It was the same thing when KOC originally said we're in the running.  Everybody's instant reaction was that it was a trade and everybody had to get their jokes off.  Not even saying I want Drummond, but people always have to jump in on jokes early.  Terry Rozier was that guy a few years ago and he's playing great in Charlotte."
Technically Terry Rozier too haha
"Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Devonte Graham. Maybe PJ Washington. I'd say the hornets have been more affected by injuries."
Terry Rozier
"how do knicks fans feel about rozier, one of the best catch and shoot players in the league and hes a legit closer, hornets are the most clutch team in the league and while its cus a lot of our guys are clutch terry has stood out the most."
"Another 3 way with these teams that I think has potential is Rozier to Orlando, Turner to Charlotte, Gordon + Orlando 1st to Indy. Orlando has the most room in the rotation for Terry right now of the three, especially if Fournier is gone.   I think it comes down to whether Charlotte wants to go forward with Terry or Graham. That’s a very good return for Orlando imo and if Indy is really eyeballing Gordon and doesn’t think they can play Sabonis with Turner, that’s a pretty good deal for them too."
I don't know if Rozier for Turner would make the Hornets better as much as I want him on our team I feel a lot of our offense goes out the window with Terry and I don't know if Turner's defense he brings is enough to offset.

"Drew Bledsoe, the Terry Rozier stopper"
Trading the guy you drafted number 2 overall four months ago for Terry rozier is about as rough as it gets .
You know things are desperate when Terry Rozier is the guy you’re rosterbating about lmao
"&gt;""During the last two minutes a team is allowed to inbound the ball anywhere on the court. Although Terry Rozier does touch the ball, PJ Washington, his teammate, was passing the ball toward the midcourt line so the ball is going to go into the backcourt anyway. The fact that Terry Rozier touched the ball, any player is allowed to retrieve the ball once it’s touched anywhere on the floor.”  You were right haha. Idk why they wouldnt include this part in the rule book:   &gt;the ball is going to go into the backcourt anyway."
"LeBron doesn’t have Tatum and brown caliber players, young stars who wanna get their own shot and show they are great. Those guys love kyrie, terry Rozier was apart of those chemistry issues too and bringing Gordon Hayward in, it was quite the situation. And Brandon Ingram played miles better after playing with LeBron, Bron wasn’t That great of a leader in 18-19 when he was playing with young stars was he?    he usually has a superstar, and/ or a veteran all star and a bunch of role players who just stand and shoot 3s...which is an optimal situation for him.  And I’m not saying kyrie is as good as LeBron or something anyway I’m just saying kyrie is treated too harshly for those years that’s all"
*angry Terry Rozier noises*
Terry Rozier has really improved and shown out this year.
"That was our argument with Terry Rozier too. He always played better when he got more minutes, and it looks like that has held with Charlotte"
"A lot of the older Hornets fans have this opinion. Keeping Terry really makes no sense going forward, and a lot of the newer Hornets fans just see Rozier hit a couple gamewinners or drop 30 points and think 'this is the guy.'  Ideally we flip him like the Clippers flipped Tobias a few years back."
"The thing is that what has made Terry work this season isn't related to his prior season. Playstyle (regardless of efficiency) is completely unrecognizable. About midway through last season the hornets, coach, and Terry saw this catch and shoot statline of his becoming elite. His role was changed to focus on that as Graham's playmaking became far superior to Rozier. Rozier has been doing what he's doing now since last season. If he plays as lead ball handler then yeah he's pretty bad. But he doesn't really do that now, he's a catch and shoot knockdown guy with some good iso's on mismatches. I think that is sustainable, and more likely the player Rozier is for the rest of his career than any level of basketball he played before."
"Man all these top comments saying Zach is crazy, meanwhile Rozier doing damn near the exact same thing. Scary Terry is hoopin hoopin"
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
some of these shooting seasons are crazy. Terry Rozier is shooting 8 a game at 43%??
"Yeah, he's started there alongside Devonte Graham at PG and Terry Rozier at SG, and those three are among our best on court trios."
"I agree with your take for the most part, but Terry Rozier is not a playmaker. He is a scorer with occasional bouts of tunnel vision. My man cannot look for others when he has it going it’s not in his nature.   Gordon is a true playmaker, but he’s always going to look for his shot first. If he isn’t a go then he’ll set the other guys up.   Lamelo is the only true pass first playmaker in the starting lineup, and his versatility in passes and excellent vision are the two things I notice the most that changes the way everyone plays when he is on the court. The team just moves differently and flows in a way that is so much more fluid than anyone else in the playmaking role. That’s why he’s the best player on the team to me.   I know everyone likes to focus on scoring, and sure it’s important in crunch time, but it’s not the end all be all and there are more ways to be successful in the clinch than taking all the shots.   This team is loaded with shooters and finishers at the guard/wing positions, and Lamelo is excellent at setting his guys up, especially in crunch time."
Terry Rozier and Lance have completely different games tho
Shoutout to MJ for finally getting the version of Lance Stephenson he was hoping for all those years ago in Terry Rozier. He had a type and wasn’t scared to chase after it again
"i'm sure u watch more games than me but Melo feels like the most impactful  until the last like 5 minutes, when MJ actually grants Terry Rozier all his powers until the final buzzer"
"He did, yes. So why mention him in a discussion about Giannis support cast when he’s yet to play a full season?  Bledsoe and Brogdon were good in the playoffs in 2018? My man. Double check that. 2018 was where the Drew Bledsoe memes started, because he got absolutely sauced by Terry Rozier and sucked ass the whole series. Brogdon was coming back from a long-term injury and played like shit (26% from three for a guy whose primary value at the time was spot up shooting). Thon, meanwhile, didn’t get minutes until game 3 but once he got on he was genuinely the only net positive player we had other than Giannis and Middleton.  You’re looking at all these names on paper without paying attention to how good they actually were. Bledsoe was a good player, never showed up for us in the playoffs at all. Give me any random guard from any of KG’s teams and I’d take my chances. Middleton has shown up in the playoffs, but also very much has not more than once.  The four KG teammates you listed performed better for the Wolves in the playoffs than any teammate Giannis has had except Middleton by a big margin. Outside of Middleton the best we’ve managed to get is flash in the pan role players who turn it on at the right time for one run (Thon 2018, Brogdon and Hill 2019). KG had plenty of those. More often than not everybody else falls apart."
"Helps that Hornets games have just been super fun overall. Malik Monk, Terry Rozier, and Devonte Graham can all light it up on any given night. The whole team tries insane passes every night as well, even when they maybe shouldn’t."
"Exactly, with scoring and pace going up PPG is weighted less heavily, more emphasis on two way players, 3pt shooting and switching. 16 players over 25ppg and another 22 above 20ppg. 38 players over 20ppg and a good chunk of them shouldn’t be in the all star game. Guys like Fred VanVleet, Khris Middleton, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Collin Sexton."
"You do realize there was a season with a lineup of Kyrie, Brown, Hayward, Tatum, Horford with Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier, etc. you can’t predict injuries. We wouldn’t be able to be in the conference finals if not for his trades. What type of argument is this."
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
TERRY ROZIER III
For me it's Terry Ariza and Trevor Rozier.  They look nothing alike but for some reason they merge in my memory.
"When was Kyrie a mega asshole? The problem on the team was Terry Rozier wanting to start because he was averaging 15/5/5 as a starter and like 8ppg as a bench player, so naturally in a contract year the guy wants to start and get paid   So he was competing directly with Kyrie, the only source of chemistry problems"
[TERRY ROZIER CONTINUES TO INDUCE FEAR IN OPPONENTS AND THE HORNETS FINALLY REACH .500 LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO](https://youtu.be/XOdfm1ZGLuk)
Terry “Clutch Time” Rozier
Micheal was just trying to imitate terry rozier his whole career
Terry Rozier is the only player in the NBA
I swear every time I decide to watch a Hornets game Terry Rozier goes off.
"I still dont get why people think rozier was a good singing, im not sure if one year out of somones contract, it being i think his last year, is good. still dont think terry deserved that contract if we account his entire CHA history"
Have you seen Terry Rozier or Marcus Smart
"When they hired him I thought everything was gonna get worse.   So glad I was wrong. He's been great. Even his moves that looked bad at first have turned out to be really good, like Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward."
"&gt; If you keep thinking your window is later you’re gonna reach a point where Tatum and browns deals are gonna be up and it’s not a lock the resign.   Our window isn't now because Tatum and Brown aren't good enough as players yet.   All you dumb Nets and Lakers fans who have an agenda against the Celtics like to create this faux state of urgency for the Celtics, when, if you actually fucking watched a Celtics game, you'd know that both players have a LONG way to go as players if they want to compete for a championship if they are the best players on the team. Neither of them know how to make anybody on their team better.   &gt; People aren’t clowning you for not trading for jrue they’re clowning you guys for having the best draft capital haul in history and not making a title contender with it  The 2018-19 Celtics had a starting 5 of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and a bench of Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes.   That was the best 9-man rotation anybody in the NBA had that year. Vegas had us as favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference.   Not Danny Ainge's fault that Gordon Hayward was a shell of himself after he broke his fucking leg and couldn't be the 2nd best player on the team like he was supposed to be."
"It’s hilarious how fans will shit on a team signing until it supports their argument to act like they are second coming of Christ. “How could you not see Gordon Hayward was the prince who was promised and Terry Rozier is a gift from the basketball gods?!?”  Meanwhile Hornets got routinely roasted for both those signings. They are playing well to be sure, but acting like Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier are so much better than a legit 12 man roster of NBA caliber basketball players (ie, the Grizzlies) is pretty ironic."
"Trae's best teammate in his first season was 21 year old John Collins.  LaMelo has Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward as vets and a few good young players in Monk and Graham and Washington.  Not saying Trae was better as a rookie, but LaMelo is much better positioned to contribute from a supporting cast perspective."
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
I. Fucking. Love. Eric Collins 🥺 I thoroughly enjoy hearing him call every Hornets game. This article made me so happy 🤓  I love when he yells “TERRY ROZIER!!!!!” And I swear I heard him make a crack about Cody Zeller balding and I cried laughing 🤣
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
"If Jordan gets 7 rings, does that make Terry Rozier the GOAT?"
"man Wood drops 20/10 and only makes $13 mil a year, that's probably the single most valuable contract in the league next to maybe Terry Rozier"
"Overall he's good. He's drafted pretty good, signed Gordon Hayward, who is the biggest free agency signing in franchise history, and somehow managed to convince Michael Jordan to draft LaMelo Ball instead of trading for Russell Westbrook. I like Russ, but Melon is obviously younger and fits our timeline more. That Terry Rozier signing is looking great, he very much deserves that contract, and he's built a solid young team.   I don't entirely fault Mitch for offering that contract to Trez. He is a young center, which we need, but obviously I wouldn't give him that money either. But small markets have to overpay to get people to actually sign with them, hence the Hayward deal (although I never hated the contract, and he is playing up to it right now)"
"Really though? Here are some people on ~20m contracts. Jerami Grant, THJ, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon, Bojan, Caris LeVert, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Gallanari, etc. Given a choice, would you willingly pay 20M for Wiggins over any of these players?"
"Keep IT, you end up keeping the draft pick that was Sexton and signing Terry Rozier to a deal instead of ever getting kemba or Kyrie (obviously they still might’ve gone after kemba). Could’ve worked well in theory  The IT thing was absolutely the right business move at the time but there’s definitely funky karma tied in there in my opinion"
Terry rozier is better than kemba
"Celtics fan talking shit???   Since drafting Tatum y’all has had 7 first round picks (2.3 per draft) and u guys still couldn’t make a quality nba roster. You basically traded Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Al Hartford, Marcus Morris for Kemba. You guys passed up on Myles turner for Gordon Hayward and got nothing instead. Despite losing all that talent and having so many young draft picks your team is in #20 in cap space with an Evan Fournier contract coming up. You guys are worse than the Kings, tatum can’t wait to leave your poverty squad and join the Lakers he doesn’t even hide it 😂"
I am embarrassed for you for posting this comment. Honestly equating the offense of Harden and Terry fucking Rozier should be a ban-able offense
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
"Ah yes the terrible, healthy in the playoffs starting line up of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Daniel Theis, Aron Baynes and Robert Williams of the bench 3 years ago. A 4-1 loss in the second round is all that could be expected of such a subpar roster. PJ Dozier on a two way then"
"Not bottom but certainly behind terry Rozier who was playing out of his mind in that stretch, as well as Hayward who seemingly played very good too. Can’t put a number 1 defender on Lamelo if your main guys are balling out, and they’re certainly not gunna double him"
"How, dude is playing with 2 all stars while Lamelo got Terry Rozier"
Terry Rozier game winner over Embiid would be cool I guess.
Terry Rozier would be a top 50 player all time after that series
Terry Rozier is a diet version of kyrie
"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.   That roster will be a conundrum for people in the future  &gt;Kyrie Irving &gt;Jaylen Brown &gt;Jayson Tatum &gt;Gordon Hayward  &gt;Al Horford  That’s just insane considering the role players like Marcus Smart, Aaron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris. They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it’s hard to forecast the future.  Can’t believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
Terry Rozier because of the legendary Osama tweet
I think I'm the only Pacers fan in existence.  I live in Louisville though and the Donovan Mitchell connection garners a lot of Jazz fans here. Much moreso than other UofL alumni like Terry Rozier or Montrezl.
"Last year I woulda said Terry Rozier in the 2018 playoffs, things sure can change fast"
"**Skill Boost**: Miles Bridges. Bridges has developed a really good jumpshot and really good defense. If he had a better handle he’d probably be a perennial All-Star.   **Athleticism Boost**: LaMelo Ball. He’s not bad athletically, but a more athletic LaMelo would be pretty similar to LeBron...  **Length Boost**: PJ Washington. He’s been our best defensive center this season, but is a little small to play the position full time. If he added a few inches in height he’d be able to play the position full time and would fix our biggest weakness.   **Other Contenders:** A 6’4”-5” Terry Rozier would be a beast. A 6’7” Malik Monk has a lot of potential. An athletic Vernon Carey Jr would be a really good rookie. If the 6’10” McDaniels had a really good handle and playmaking he’d be super interesting, especially since he’s already a good shooter."

"Same, that guy ruined the highlights. When terry rozier hit that shot to end the quarter, he sounded like they just won the finals. “GOT IIIIIIIIITTTTT!!!”"
Crazy numbers from AD. He had almost as many points as Terry Rozier.
Terry Rozier is great literally the most dead possible slate on a Sunday night and he still gives us something and makes it worthwhile to watch  Man that McDaniels -23 in 15 min in a 2 point game
Terry Rozier is probably single handedly putting Charlotte up there.
Not a very good example but Brad Wanamaker has exceeded my expectations based on what Warriors fans said about him. Legitimately saved us in a couple wins with all of our injuries lmao.  Also Terry Rozier.
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"

"&gt;Devil's advocate; first half of the season also counts (Melo was a lot better pre-All-Star break), and Melo has helped a team that wasn't meant to sniff the playoffs reach that level;   This is the narrative from when he was drafted. Since then they signed Hayward. LaMelo helped a lot sure but a career year from Terry Rozier and the arrival of Hayward were bigger factors not to mention improvements from Malik Monk and Miles Bridges."
Terry Rozier has steel ankles. That is all
"There young players and their whole team got way too big of a head when they went to the ECF vs the Cavs a few years back. Rather than understand that the East was super-weak and that Lebron was bored (hence it going 7), they actually believed they were in contention. They shit on Kyrie (justifiably so), they shit on Terry Rozier (and when things get back they shit on Walker), Tatum shit on everyone(see the texts his GF released on Instagram), and basically they had to realize that they are not champions yet. I think they will be fine if they just stay the course (good foundation, good coach)."
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"

#TERRY ROZIER HOW DO YOU DO
Remember when Terry Rozier and Perry Dozier were a thing on the celtics?
"Lol I don’t think this thread is gonna go well for me. My comment was definitely kinda uppity, and I see how a lot of people took it wrong. All I wanted to suggest, was that it doesn’t really make sense that Kevin Love would leak this sorta stuff, a 12 year vet with a max contract and a pretty quiet agency.  These types of leaks almost always come from younger guys looking for bigger opportunities, with Agencies kinda encouraging turmoil. Best example would be Terry Rozier, confirmed to have leaked a ton of stuff from that Celtics team a few years back."
"Nesmith is going to be good.  It's really been starting to click for him.  I wouldn't write off Langford yet either.  He does some things well, he's just missed so much development time.  &gt; Opposed to Pritchard, Timelord and Terry Rozier as good selections  So hitting on 3 picks in the 14-30 range in 6 years is somehow bad?  (And I'd argue 4 with Nesmith).  How many teams are really doing better than that drafting in the back half of the first round?  Ainge is a good drafter."
So does Terry Rozier if you think about it

"Underrated by analysts: demar derozan. Analysts act like it’s just straight up impossible to build a good team with him on it but I just don’t see why. Yes he’s not an ideal spacer or defender, but he’s an above average playmaker, takes care of the ball, is a very good scorer, and honestly it’s not like defenses treat him like Ben Simmons.  Underrated by counting stats: Jakob Poeltl (homer take but I do believe this), Dorian finney smith, Zubac  Underrated by casuals: Paul George. He does say some things that make him unlikable at times but casuals also treat him like he isn’t a top 15 player at worst.   Underrated season: Terry Rozier, Paul George again, Robert Williams (I think he’s shown promise as a long term starting center), kinda TJ McConnell."
"Yup. NBA just doesn't really see much star free agency movement (especially when you exclude the players that are moving to create super teams with whoever currently has cap space, and look instead solely at the players that moved for the destination).  Biggest name that moved in free agency in the past decade that wasn't moving to create/join a super team is probably Al Horford to Boston, Terry Rozier to the Hornets, or Andre Iguodala to the Warriors. edit: LaMarcus Aldridge to the Spurs."
"Some type of hybrid between Devonte' Graham and Terry Rozier, but with a really high vertical."
"Both teams have a top 30-35 player in hayward and trae, top 50 players in john collins, terry rozier and lamelo ball is fringe top 50, so yeah both very deep teams."
76ers were heavily favored in those first 3 games according to vegas. Celtics struggled to get by the 7 seed bucks and everyone thought the Celtics didn't stand a chance. Kyrie was out for the year and Terry Rozier was the starting PG. It was also Tatum's first year playing and Jaylen Browns 2nd year.

"I'm of the opinion that anyone who has such a visceral overreaction to a difference of opinion in a sport is fragile and beyond weak-minded. You've offered no retort of value beyond ad hominem attacks and strawmanning my position as if I think he's terry rozier. I have no hope of reaching you because you're at the wrong end of the dunning kruger scale.  If he's worthy of MVP chants, then 15-20 guys in the league are too. If that opinion brings you to tears then maybe you need thicker skin LOL. Fragile."
"I’ve never hated a Celtic player more than terry rozier.  Not that he was awful, but he played with blinders on the whole game."
"Demar - 21/4/7 59% ts, Demar has great clutch scoring volume, his clutch shooting has not been good with a 47% efg.  SGA - 24/5/6 62% ts, better output on better efficiency, better clutch shooting, better defense    Lavine - 28/5/5 63% ts, worse on d but more than makes up for it with a massive gap in offensive output and efficiency  Fox - 25/4/7 56% ts, better offensive output, worse efficiency, more clutch scoring on slightly better shooting.  If you wanna say Demar is better based on efficiency fine. But you can't do that and say he's been better than Lavine/SGA at the same time.  Sabonis - 20/12/6 59% ts, much better overall output on equal efficiency. idk how you make the argument that 1pt and1ast is worth 8reb, but maybe you think that.  I won't mess with the rest. I could see arguments for either side, but I would have no problem with Demar being considered better than any of those guys. I will say though, there's no way Hayward has been better than Rozier this year. That is all reputation, and not at all what you see if you watch their games. Rozier is better in basically every advanced metric, but the kicker, the thing that makes it not even really close is that Terry has been a monster in crunchtime. CHA's leading scorer in the clutch on 55/50/90 splits."
He’s not that good. He’s terry rozier if terry rozier missed every shot
"its not about being fragile, i just can't deal with stupidity, i have to call it out. you said all you have to do is average 20 points a game like he is terry rozier or something."
Random but idk why but this level of blatant ignorance just reminded me of when Barcelona called Zenit and said they were interested in buying Andriy Arshavin (spellcheck) and Zenit actually replied “give us Messi and he’s yours.”   I just want to know what Barca said in response when they heard that. This was like 27 year old Messi mid prime lmfao. It’s a bit like saying you’d only trade Terry Rozier for prime Lebron.

"Because you deleted your comment I’ll reply here:  &gt;mpj has dominant stretches defensively   His defense isn’t good. It’s not just about playing on ball D. If he lets his guy just run past him off ball and get an easy cut to layup that isn’t good. That happens a lot. He doesn’t have the speed to prevent top tier wings from blowing past him either.   It’s like how people on r/nba say that Donovan, pascal siakam, or jaylen brown are “plus defenders”.   They are all pretty mediocre defenders because their off ball skills are bad (except siakam). MPJ is in the same vein, but not nearly as good on ball as those 3.   And 2 years of coaching isn’t that far from “being on the court”.  There are tons of guys like terry rozier who mostly get their experience from practice early on rather than game time. Practice makes them improve just as much. Just throwing a random rookie and giving him minutes isn’t some magical way to “improve” a player. He doesn’t magically have a way steeper growth curve than the other guys in his draft class because of playing time.   MPJ is a one way play finisher who puts up decent stats on easy buckets. His contract will probably be slightly less than what the raptors gave siakam, who is a significantly better player (though older). That’s about 25 mil a year."
"I think almost all young guys besides Luka and Trae have to improve as a playmaker and reading defenses. Donovan Mitchells started doing it and he's in the top 10 for MVP. And hard agree on all the Fournier takes. Hes got a little French in his game and reads the floor well, like Diaw and Batum. Was a stud in the Olympics a while back.   My main critique of the Celtics FO is the Walker acquisition. He is not a player who fits in that system. He was all iso and pnr in Charlotte, who had some ungodly low number of his field goals being assisted. Kinda weird but a Terry Rozier or a Tomas Satoransky is who they need in that slot. a combo guard who can be a secondary creator but is also a deadly floor spacer and defender. Not a pure scoring point like Kemba. Having Smart at the 2 compounds this even more imo because he's not a bad initiator but can't space for Kemba and he's a ball stopper sometimes (though he makes the right passes a decent bit too)."
Isn't Terry Rozier really clutch in end-game situations? Maybe I'll go with him

Terry rozier really turned Eric Bledsoe from promising young point guard into a meme after one playoff run.
"As a Nuggets fan, I did not care about the score, but that Hornets announcer was hyping everything, I started rooting for Carmelo and Terry Rozier to knock down shots. I think that guy would be able to hype some bridge card game in the nursing home. He should go straight to TNT instead of Marv."
"Piss poor offensive performance, we deserved to lose. It's not that hot of a take to say that Terry Rozier is better than Kemba now, is it?"
"Big reason I'm a Hornets fan tbh. I understand if people get annoyed by Eric Collins' energy, but personally every time they score I really, really love hearing ""**MILES BRIDGES!!!**"" or ""**TERRY ROZIER!

Bledsoe has been hot garbage ever since he got absolutely sonned by Terry Rozier in the 2018 playoffs

Terry Rozier. I would love to see the new Terry in the playoffs
Yesterday I heard a guy call a philly sports radio station saying they’d trade him straight up for Terry Rozier. A little much but he is insanely frustrating to watch nightly.
"I acknowledged that they had bad injuries and that that would affect ANT. You won't acknowledge for some reason that Ball's own injury might have had something to do with his last month of play. But having D'Lo and KAT is still two All-Star level players on the court with him when they are there, which might be more help than Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward (who was also injured and played the same amount of games as D'Lo btw)  But you also have not acknowledged anything I have brought up regarding the fact that LaMelo also improved as the season went on and not just ANT, and the Good/Bad halves of the season dont exactly make it 'painfully obvious' that ANT was better.   You have your opinion and I respect that, tho I disagree. Have a good one."
Much easier to get assists passing to Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward than Josh Okogie and Juancho Hernangomez. Just saying.....
The Celtics and Cavs went to the 2018 conference finals because the East was a poverty conference. The Celtics were frauds and just because the 76ers were also terrible doesn't excuse you. There was a fraudulent 2 seed prancing around without their star player and you couldn't hold them accountable. You let Terry Rozier drag his nuts on your face. It was an embarrassment.
"Bucks   The 2018 Celtics without Kyrie or Hayward took the Cavs to 7. They were led by Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Rookie Tatum and young Brown  Hell the Pacers took the Cavs to 7 and they were led by Oladipo lol  Meanwhile this Bucks team has a 2 time MVP and DPOY with 2 other stars and shooters around him"
"Got a good one and it’s my own team. The Celtics in 2018 when Hayward and Kyrie were both out (#1 and #2 at the time). Terry Rozier (3rd year), Jaylen Brown (2nd year), Jayson Tatum (rook) and a bunch of role players beat the Sixers, Bucks and were minutes away from making the finals against LeBron, who was still completely unstoppable. Tatum dunked in LeBrons grill and then chest bumped him after. The 2018 playoff Celtics were really an awesome team that I believe would’ve given the warriors a run for their money had they gotten through LeBron."
When Terry Rozier was still on the Celtics I had someone tell me that he could be a better version of Westbrook if he had his own team
Terry rozier and Michael Porter jr come to mind for me.
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
"No. He can become a decent 6th man, but his finishing around the rim is too horrible to become a superstar and he's too streaky. Maybe he can improve like Terry Rozier but even then it is still not good enough to be a superstar"
"Teams aren’t rebuilding forever. If you are the Cavs, Bulls etc and if you are looking for 3-4 contracts you should be thinking that you might be playoff team in 1-2 years, so it technically won’t be a rebuilding team far into future.  And yes you are right on that second point. It’s really up to the GM to do due diligence on the player. Role player contracts can also win you championship as well as lose them. I can think of 20+ role player signings that were immediately thought as overpaid and then worked out to be undervalued even in year one.  Some examples in the past 3-4 years: Terry Rozier, Kyle Anderson, Julius Randle, Jae Crowder (3-4 times lol), Seth Curry, PJ Tucker etc"
Terry rozier reggie Jackson Spidermans pointing meme

Nash? IT? Terry rozier?
"Dejounte Murray (because of age), Malcolm, Bogi, FVV, Terry Rozier."
"it's sort of like when terry rozier thinks he's the best player on the floor. it's like, aww, good for you"
"The Celtics have made a lot of role players look like studs and helped them get paid on the market  Two examples. Evan Turner (70m/4yrs), Terry Rozier (57m/3yrs)"
"Robert Williams, Terry Rozier, Peyton Pritchard even"
"I’ll go contract-by-contract and defend them:  * Brogdon: I can see taking Bogi, they’re about equal in contract and ability. But Brogdon can match Bogi’s scoring and defense while also being a better passer. * Turner is a DPOY caliber player and one of the league’s best shot blockers, he single-handedly carried the Pacers defense this year. Definitely taking him over Bogi. * Capela is also a phenomenal defender, but he’s also one of the league’s top rebounders and a menace in the PNR. For me, he’s easily a top ten C in the league, and this isn’t even close. * Rose is a 6MOTY caliber guy who massively helped the Knicks go on their run to the four seed. If he and Bogi were on the same contracts, I’d take Bogi, but $7m a year for what Rose has done is phenomenal. Rose could easily get a $15m-$20m contract in the open market IMO. * Noel should be All-Defense first team. He’s a really, really good defender. For $5m a year (barely more than the VetMin), that’s hard to beat. * I could see taking Bogi over Monte Morris because of the talent gap, but $9m a year is just so cheap for a starting-level PG. I could see this one coming down to team need. * O’Neal is one of the league’s best 3 and D guys and a key role player for the Jazz. I could see him being worth Joe Harris money and getting a contract in the $16m-$18m a year range. * Kleber is a good defender, but I can see taking Bogi over him.  * DFS’s shot seems to come and go, but he’s a solid defender, decent rebounder, and $4m a year is a pittance. * Ibaka is a solid all-around, decent shooter, good defender, and has slightly improved every year he’s been in the league. He was on $16m a year with the Raptors and reportedly turned down an extension in that range to go contend in LA.  For me personally, Bogi’s $18m a year is about what he’s worth. His scoring hasn’t been proven consistent, though he’s been on fire of late- earlier in the season, people were bashing his contract as being on an overpay. If he can keep up this kind of scoring, then he’s worth more, but, if you look at the contracts of, Terry Rozier, TJ Warren, Caris Levert, or Terrence Ross, I think $18m a year is about right for a good-shooting/streaky scoring second guy."
The Hornets got Terry Rozier and Hayward.
I give that honor to Terry Rozier the day Bin Laden died: Osama shouldve hooped instead of tryna kill ppl cause he tall as hell!  But KD is the NBA Twitter GOAT easily.
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
"Ahh yes, we call that the Terry Rozier special."
Ben Simmons can’t guard Trae. He is way too small and quick and crafty. Simmons got cooked by Terry Rozier in the playoffs a few years ago
I don't know how effective Terry Rozier will be by then
Don’t forget when Terry Rozier clowned Eric Bledsoe by calling him Drew Bledsoe. Pretty all time as well.
"I just want to see us do a deal centered around Terry Rozier for Myles Turner, who is apparently being shopped."
Terry Rozier
We got a fresh Terry Rozier for ya
"But Dame is like...5 levels higher as a scorer lol. He's like the same volume, but with a 8% high TS%, which is an absolutely massive difference. 8% is the difference between Steph Curry and Reggie Jackson or Terry Rozier, for example. Or hell it's the same as between Lebron and Anthony Edwards, Lou Dort, and Stanley Johnson lmao  Plus, while Russ is a better playmaker, but Dame gets 8 assists a night and is **extremely** low TO, whereas Russ obviously gets a ton of them. And we can see in this series that he's more than capable of upping that passing volume (10+ assists in 4/5 games so far)"
"Possibly Terry Rozier, I don't know if Kemba is on his level though"
"I am not sold on Brad Stevens as a GM, it doesnt seem like he can even coach or assess talent.  I mean Hayward left, Terry Rozier left, I mean those are very quality players...."
Terry Rozier
Terry Rozier has a higher true shooting percentage in the clutch
Yeah I mean at the time it felt right to let him walk. Then he blossomed with a bigger role in CHA. Celtics essentially lost the “trade” between Rozier and Kemba in that regard. They would be way better off with Scary Terry right now still

Terry Rozier
"Boston fans: tErrY rOziEr iS beTteR tHaN kYriE anYwAy, idC iF he LeaVeS  \*Kyrie leaves\*  Boston fans:  Fuck Kyrie! Why would he leave us like that?!"
"Tatum has clearly shown over now 4 years of playoffs that he can be himself in high stakes scenarios  As for the Knicks, I wouldn't feel too bad. You get guys like RJ real playoff minutes, guys like Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier (and even Jaylen) never missed the playoffs as prospects and got at least 20 min every year. I have to think that left a real impact."
The Terry Rozier effect
In the playoffs? Terry Rozier did more as a Celtic than Kyrie. Saying Tatum was better isn’t some huge stretch
Imagine if they just paid terry rozier
the great part is it's basically all Miles Bridges with Malik Monk and Terry Rozier scattered in there.   PJ and Zeller can get mean occasionally but neither gets a lot of air.
It all started when Terry Rozier crossed him into a different dimension and drained a three in his face
"lmao from all reports he changed his mind in december. so a few months after his initial committment. yes people can change their minds but if you change your mind that quickly, be prepared for criticism(which kyrie clearly wasnt ready for)  and going with the clown ass narrative of the ""unloyal"" danny ainge? lmao thats hilarious. also, ive never really seen a positive kyrie-JB interaction since kyrie left and a lot of the key players on that 18-19 team left that offseason. I hope you also hate on thunder fans for hating KD or spurs fans for hating kawhi. Because kyrie literally quit in the middle of playoff series in a season with championship expectations lmao. and unlike KD and kawhi, he never did anything meaningful in a celtics uniform(one playoff series win against a 5 seed missing their all star). terry rozier legitimately did more in a celtics uniform than kyrie did. you expect celtics fans to give him his flowers or something?"
"Eric Bledsoe single handedly got Terry Rozier a 50+ million contract.   Not that he doesn’t deserve it, but I don’t know if he would have the recognition around the league to get paid like that if he hadn’t clowned Bledsoe in the playoffs."
"Yep. It’s a little bit of a catch-22 because PJ at the 5 allows for some small-ball lineups that really unlock Bridges at the 4, but trading for Turner dramatically improved our base lineup.   Can I interest you in a Terry Rozier?"
"Pritchard at 27 isn’t anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that’s solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn’t like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it’s concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn’t pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
" I Remember when Terry Rozier dunked on Durant earlier this season, it looked like Durant's leg bent in the most awkward angle but he just got up like nothing happened. Dude is made of spaghetti"
Just listen to Brad Stevens. Imagine being in the locker room hearing a soft spoken trying to be inoffensive fool handling Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. No wonder Kyrie changed his mind.
Terry Rozier left 0.5 on the clock once...
He was never the same after Terry Rozier showed up wearing that Drew Bledsoe jersey
"The average value of a double-digit pick just isn't that high, is the thing. Most players picked later in the draft just aren't going to be stars. Sure, we don't have the track record of, like, the Raptors wrt late firsts, but since 2015 we've had 9 first-round picks outside the top 10 (not including the ones we immediately traded), of which:  — 2 (Terry Rozier, Rob Williams) are already starting-caliber players  — 2 (Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard) project to be very solid NBA players going forward  — 2 (Romeo Langford, Grant Williams) are fringe NBA-caliber players, although we've seen so little of Langford that he could end up either a tier down or up  — 3 (RJ Hunter, Guerschon Yabusele, Ante Zizic) were complete misses  For late firsts, I don't think that's a bad track record at all. He hasn't *completely* missed on a first-rounder since 2016 (though we'll see about Langford)."
"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here’s just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De’Aaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D’Angelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"Has he had any hits past pick 10 in the draft though? I guess Time Lord could still be a hit, but remains to be seen. And Terry Rozier seems like a solid player, though not with the Celts past rookie contract."
"This is literally so fucking cool.   I did Joe Johnson &amp; Lebron James, Terry Rozier &amp; Larry Bird, and Dominique Wilkins and Trae Young. The UI layout is incredibly intuitive. 100/100, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
This RPM is most stupid thing. I mean do you really believe that is Terry Rozier much better than Embiid and Harden? 🙄
And apparently now Terry Rozier lol
And all because Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart didn't want to pass to Jaylen Brown...
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier. Sounds like a pretty solid team to me. Except it wasn't, and we know exactly why, because only one of those guys is still a shitty teammate. And it just so happens he was supposed to be the one that held it all together."
No lmao. He’s a higher end role player. Terry Rozier would not be averaging 16 FGA on a championship caliber team.
"And it's corny because, Kyrie gets blamed for an overall shitty team afford. He sucked, but if he stayed Terry Rozier and Marcus Morris (unjustified) would get the flack. It is indeed corny to hide a bad playing team behind one bad playing player. I have never read about how bad of a leader Horford was, or how bad the J's played, because it was all focused on Kyrie. He played really bad, but the whole approach of the Celtics fans was far away from a honest review. He wasn't the scapegoat, but a easy target to hid behind."

"????? You think the person Danny chose over Rozier was Smart when the way the Rozier signed with the Hornets was thru a sign and trade for Kemba Walker?  I'm on Team Terry, but I'm also on Team Smart and he def was not the ""issue"" (I still love Kemba, just in hindsight would prefer Terry)"
"Thats a bit annoying in the sense that guys seemed to look off Lamelo and Rozier wasnt geting anything going himself. Weirdly played game by charlotte, i know lamelo could be rusty but hes also your future, dont need to bench him early first/early 3rd. This guy put you in position of even being a legit team to begin with via his early season games, i woulda ride and died by his play and even if he failed, thats your superstar he can use the experience. If Terry was going off then itd make some sense, but with as cold as he was Lamelo shouldve been hero-balling imo"
"Stacey King to Terry Rozier ""DID YOU NOT GET THE MEMO!!?!!!!"""
"Just to play devils advocate for terry, he pulled off a similar dunk earlier in the series https://youtu.be/6Fx6iPO9cEs  Lebron was further back on that one though, and Rozier I guess got a little ambitious with his attempt in game 7 lol"
"I can just see the headlines tomorrow on ESPN  ""Is LaMelo Ball the ROTY still?""  ""Should the Hornets trade Terry Rozier?"""

Terry and Rozier is just a single person
You ever turn down an open layup on a fast break just to 20 seconds later have Terry Rozier jack up a contested corner 3..... truly beautiful basketball
Terry Rozier kinda getting exposed in this game
Terry rozier is just letting that bitch fly
Terry Rozier is playing better than he did in a Game 7. That's worth something right?
Terry Rozier in Game 7 form
"The biggest difference here though is the \~$35M difference between Terry Rozier's contract and the reported $90M contract Schroeder is looking to bag. While I 100% think he was overpaid at the time, Rozier has developed nicely into a solid scorer and legitimate offensive threat for the Hornets, making his current contract much more valuable.   Schroeder on the other hand has already likely peaked as a player and will plateau from here. Not to say he's old or declining, but if he wasn't worth $90M coming into this season, I don't think he's really worth a guaranteed multi-year $90M going into his 30's. That being said, stranger things have happened in FA and I've definitely been proven wrong more than once."
"Maybe he thinks he could pull a Terry Rozier? Guy went from ""good backup on a good team"" to ""overpaid starter on a bad team"" to ""well-paid starter on a promising, fringe-playoff team."""
Shout out to Terry Rozier who this place thought should be out of the league before he went to Charlotte.
lamelo wasn't leading the hornets to the playoffs lol why do yall act like gordon hayward wasn't their best player when healthy and terry rozier wasn't their go to guy in the clutch  lamelo was very important but he wasn't the leader of the team

Terry rozier having +20 in a tie game is so fucking weird lol
"Terry Rozier from Celtics bench, to Celtics starter to Hornets."
I would trade terry rozier for fucking kemba walker man
LaMelo Ball... SUCKS Terry Rozier... SUCKS Gordon Hayward... SUCKS
"As I said, if he has, it's a rare specism. But you should understand why those don't like Embiid. Sixersfan dislike Terry Rozier for the same reason."
"But like, KD and kyrie together wasn’t a lock to win a chip. People still had the lakers over them. It was the trade for harden that put them over the top. The Danny criticism here is that he wouldn’t make the same move if put in the same situation. Dude wouldn’t even trade terry rozier for the longest much less future first round picks."
"Maybe they can replace him with a high level role player. Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Richaun Holmes, anyone who isn't a pure onball scorer maybe?"
Who tf talks about Terry Rozier
"Karl Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton (recently), Terry Rozier, Victor Oladipo."
"i like terry a lot too, don't get me wrong. But I don't think the problem with the hornets is scoring, and i think you can use rozier as a closer while playing him from the bench.   I think if you have Lamelo Lonzo and Gordon as your backcourt, you have so much defensive presence and passing ability. But, to your point, no breakthrough scorer... cuz rozier is the best bucket getter on the team.  I think Lonzo as a backup guard could work by pairing him with Graham. But Lonzo works best with a primary ball handler, which lamelo is, and lonzo gets to work as an off-ball facilitator.  Yeah it's a tough one, but I'd start Lonzo and Lamelo, and figure out what to do about Rozier and Hayward. Do you want more scoring, go with Rozier. And Hayward has the additional benefit of playing as a small ball 4."
Gordon Hayward + Terry Rozier
"Seems like no one is really doing a starting 5, so here we go:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: Terry Rozier  SF: Jerami Grant  PF: Eric Paschall  C: Jahlil Okafor"
"Delusional is claimimg that championships are automatically won by the team with the most talent even when that talent has only managed to play a few regular season games together. It's so easy for you to argue when you're arguing from a fantasy world where everything plays out exactly how you say it does with absolutely 0 variance. Nets are heavy favorites, obviously. They're better than any team in the league by a good margin. That doesn't make them automatic champs. Kyrie and Harden have both had moments where they didn't show up in the playoffs, Kyrie even did it against the Bucks one year being guarded by the same Bledsoe that got torched by fucking Terry Rozier. There's always a chance that happens again and they choke it away."
This total fucking chump I knew in 2017 was insisting to me terry rozier was better than kyrie and when you hear a take like that you’re like ok this kid just doesn’t know ball
"I made this trade in the trade machine a 3 team trade.  76ers get:  Terry Rozier  Buddy Hield  resign Danny Green  Zeller (s&amp;t 3 years 3 million each year)  2 unprotected picks from Sac. 2023 and 2025.  &amp;#x200B;  Kings get:   Ben Simmons  &amp;#x200B;  Hornets get:  Bagley  Thybulle  First round 2021 kings.  &amp;#x200B;  The Hornets get a young guys and the first, they lose their best SG in the team which it has a ton of value after last season.   76ers get 2 unprotected (that can trade to improve even more) Rozier and Buddy Hield, 2 good shooters that have a lot of value they can still trade them to improve or keep em both or one of them. They get Zeller really as a salary thing and also backup Center.  Kings Ben Simmons."
Terry rozier rated higher that smart… a lot of things i personally didnt agree with in terms of consistency. The teams success during their tenure seems to matter more than individual skill/contribution
Marcus Smart B+  Terry Rozier A-  Huh?
The Lakers get LA  The clippers get Riverside  Cavs winning a chip tho  Steph CJ LeBron Larry Kosta Koufos  Terry Rozier Gary Trent Jr Luke Kennard Caris Lavert  Admittedly short on post players but nobody is stopping this offense

"In a league dominated by stellar guard play and depth, where is Maxey gonna start? Where is Maxey going to be a top 3 franchise asset?  Teams barely even want Colin Sexton or Terry Rozier or Schroeder or McCollum or Reggie Jackson or other players of that caliber. Would Maxey be more impactful than these listed guys?   As for the Wolves? If they got Simmons they'd be too big to fail in the regular season. They'd finish above 0.500 and out of the lottery."
People clearly just don’t watch Bulls games man lmao I don’t know how you could watch Zach once this year and think “yeah I’d rather have terry rozier”
Lmao the fuck?  Booker and PG are better and Brown and Mithcell are arguable  FVV Shai CJ and fucking Terry Rozier wth they aint even close to him except Shai who's really a PG
Bruh terry rozier and Fred are not on that tier

"I think he's going to get a contract similiar to Terry Rozier / Ricky Rubio, 18-22m/yr range"
"I think our opinions just differ. IMO JT was the best but I can see the argument for Al  Horford. Terry Rozier tho. He wasn't better than Tatum, he disappeared more"
He'll get a Terry Rozier contract.

"Booker’s low assists are one thing. The issue is that hes consistently has a turnover problem in the past that hasn’t gone away despite not being the main playmaker. The only guy with at least 2.75 turnovers per game (he has 3.1) and the same or fewer assists per game is Embiid.   It’s just untrue to say all the things KAT’s better at is due to him being a center. Booker’s significantly worse from 3 for example and has been for years.  His advanced stats don’t just look bad compared to KAT’s or centers’, they look bad in general.   He has a negative bpm. Some of the guards above him who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard: Sexton, Reggie Jackson, Brunson, both Murrays, Devonte Graham, Haliburton, Clarkson, Fox, Brogdon, T.J., both Ball brothers, Kemba, Terry, Delon Wright, FVV, Jaylen, Westbrook, Beal, CJ, Mitchell, Jrue, and Conley.  His win shares per 48 is worse than qualifying  guards like CP3, Conley, Mitchell, Jrue, Trae, Brunson, CJ, PG, LaVine, Beal, Jamal, Lowry, TJ, Seth, Delon Wright, Jaylen, Reggie Jackson, Kemba, Clarkson, Connaughton, KCP, Rozier, Hardaway Jr., Brogdon, Campazzo and FVV.   Guys who played fewer games and still have a higher vorp include Kyrie, Russ, Zach, Beal, Jrue, Mitchell, Conley, Jaylen, CJ, Terry, FVV, Brogdon, Fox, Shai, Jamal, both Ball brothers, Kemba, Haliburton, Lowry, Cam Payne, and Thybulle.  There is no reason for Booker to do so poorly in advanced stats across the board on such a good team where other guys do well in advanced stats. Not to mention his advanced stats were still incredibly low when he was a first option."
Tony Allen was a 3x first team all defense and is widely regarded as the best perimeter defender of his generation. It’s weird nobody gave him a max contract.  Khris Middleton has never averaged more than 20 a game. Terry Rozier averaged 20 this past season
"I mean, I think Kyrie has different ideas of the role of a coach than others might. And to a certain extent, hes such a great player that it makes sense to give him a little leeway to improvise and make decisions about how to play things depending what’s going on in the game. But I think back to what Terry said about the Kyrie and Brad relationship and though I obviously don’t know how accurate his interpretation is, it matches with the way Kyrie speaks about Kenny here.  “It kind of wasn't coach-player ... It was kind of like coach-younger coach” and “Kyrie had a lot of stuff that he felt that could change, that he wanted to change about the Celtics. All on-court things. He felt like he knew a lot of his basketball” and “He had his little input and he wasn't holding back. He would say what he felt that we could change or we could do. Sometimes it would work out for us, sometimes it wouldn't. Sometimes they would talk it out and make it happen.”  https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/terry-rozier-offers-notable-insight-195330309.html"
"It's starting to look like he's lost his spot on our team but he's not nearly as bad as our sub treats him.   His biggest problem is that he's too passive. If a team can get him to come out of his shell consistently he could be a nice rotation piece.   ***  **Shooting:**   From a 3P shooting standpoint, he was as accurate and as frequent as Jae Crowder was for us over his last 2 seasons in Boston, he just played a smaller role.    | 3P%| 3PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi| 36.7 | 6.0 Jae (2015-17) | 36.9| 5.9   The issue is Jae scored a lot more off everything else. He was a much better cutter and more active scorer overall. Semi is too passive outside of his shooting.     | 2P%| 2PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi | 49.2| 2.4 Jae (2015-17)| 53.4| 6.0  ***  **Defence:**   Semi has an incredible defensive body: 6'6, 240lbs, good vert, great lateral quickness, good wingspan, absurd strength and a lot of that strength is in his lower body.    You'll legitimately see power forwards bounce off him. He's the immovable object we often play when dealing with an unstoppable force.   Last season we had a good example against the Knicks. Randle was getting to the rim at will powering through everyone on our roster. We subbed in Semi. Randle bounced off Semi once or twice. Randle stopped trying to drive towards the rim.    The issue again is his passiveness. He's too much of a gentle giant. He's great at using his strength to absorb contact, but he doesn't use that strength to bully anyone.  You see it in the stats, he has a low foul rate (considering the role we have him in) but he just doesn't take any risks [\(eg. 0 blocks all season\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndzqlt/semi_ojeleye_finished_the_season_with_zero_0/)   ***   **Culture:**  You're not going to get anyone less drama-prone. His workouts are the most famous thing about him:   &gt; It sounded like a sledgehammer was hitting behind Al Horford's locker stall inside TD Garden and Boston’s veteran big man can feel the reverberations as he puts on his shoes. But Horford just smiles and shakes his head. &gt;  &gt; “I have a lot of faith in those concrete walls,” said Horford. &gt;  &gt; Boom. &gt;  &gt; These loud thuds became a familiar white noise in the Celtics locker room after games this season. But, by late April, it felt like the noise was getting louder. Marcus Morris’ stall is a safe distance from the epicenter but even he couldn't help but notice the decibel level.  &gt;  &gt; “Shem, god damn,” said Morris.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Further across the room, Terry Rozier heard the noise but always figured it was just part of the perpetual construction happening around the Garden. Gordon Hayward, who is as far from the pounding as possible, was more aware of what was happening in the adjoining weight room.   &gt;...  &gt;Those booms were a medicine ball that Ojeleye had repeatedly launched into a wall as part of a CrossFit-like routine that Celtics rehab and performance coordinator Zach Markowitz had designed for Ojeleye on nights he doesn’t get into game action.  &gt;https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/semi-ojeleyes-wall-rattling-workouts-have-readied-him-giannis-antetokounmpo   So if you want someone who's just going to turn up and work without stepping on anyone's toes, that's Semi in a nutshell. But you're not going to hear reports about him holding players accountable or taking a vocal role in the locker room.   ***  The big issue with Semi is that he just doesn't do enough to justify a roster spot atm. It's not an abundance of lowlights that holds him back, it's a lack of highlights.  You'd be happy with everything he provides, if only he was providing more.  Put him on a team like Brooklyn where Harden can feed him corner 3s and he'll have vets like Green (and potentially Tucker) pushing him to be more aggressive defensively and maybe he could be a really nice piece."
 Terry Rozier back at it again
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn’t move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn’t move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That’s a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn’t work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
Terry Rozier maybe???
"You mean missing Kyrie and Hayward thoughout those playoffs doesnt count?  Boston’s playoff starting lineup was Rozier/Brown/Tatum/Horford/Baynes  Worth noting that Tatum was a rookie, Brown a sophomore, and Terry a 3rd year bench player"
"These moves would be laughably bad. Why would they be interested in folding Terry Rozier into their future? Or going win-now mode when their team is super young?   Also no way that OKC would ever give up SGA, dude is for sure a future star."
"Yeah he played himself into that Terry Rozier tier of contracts I think.   Crazy to say after he looked China bound last year, good for him."
Isolation Joseph for Joe Johnson and Scarence Terrence for Terry Rozier
Terry Rozier is first in EFG% but lillard has more attempts and is right behind him
Franchise cornerstone Terry Rozier
&gt;and Charlotte’s Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.
"&gt; The source told the Daily News that the Knicks are interested in packaging rising star RJ Barrett in a deal for a star guard, like Portland’s Damian Lillard or Washington’s Bradley Beal. If both the Trail Blazers and Wizards are uninterested in a deal, the source says the Knicks are also monitoring Cleveland’s Collin Sexton, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Charlotte’s Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.  Rozier is like 9 months younger than Beal."
Yeah it’s difficult to give a bag to undersized scoring guards unless they can slot into a bigger playmaker. For what it’s worth Houston kind of has that if they’re high on Kevin Porter.   Part of the reason I think Terry Rozier stop getting so much shit is he’s playing next to LaMelo
"&gt; any player in NBA history would have stood a chance at winning that Celtics series in less than 7 games let alone even making it there lol.  Lmao huh???? They were lead by a ROOKIE Tatum and Terry Rozier, wtf 😭😭😂😂 The Bucks were not good and being coached by Joe Prunty don’t be ridiculous. They took a massive leap the next year.  The myth making for Lebron is so fucking funny. Beating Oladipo, DeRozan, rookie Tatum, GOAT postseason I guess.   Also the Warriors are HOFers because of their rings lmao they werent HOFers before they won anything. If they’re so fraudulent, it’s not impressive that Lebron beat them anyway."
"Warriors get:   * Gordon Hayward   * Terry Rozier   Hornets get:   * Andrew Wiggins   * James Wiseman   * 7th overall   * 2022 1st   Warriors get a minor upgrade at SF as well as a dude who would be 6MOY or could start while Klay works back into shape. Hornets get a good SF, a center prospect, a high lotto pick to add another young guy to the Lamelo/Graham/PJ/Wiseman core, and a 2022 pick as sweetener."
See: Terry Rozier and the hornets in general this season
"Not total turnover but after the 16-17 season, the Celtics got rid of everyone but Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Al Horford, and Jaylen Brown. Smart and Rozier were also the only guys left from the 15-16 team."
MJ 200 IQ for taking the gamble on Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward tho
"&gt;It honestly stands out to me as maybe the most puzzling pick since I've been following the NBA. Up there with Anthony Bennett #1 and Thon Maker #10.  I remember Terry Rozier being a super controversial pick for us in 2015, with the common sentiments being that we could have gotten him in the second round. I think people only forgot about it because he actually turned into a solid player."
"I think you're probably right, from the Cleveland perspective, that Durant's bitch-ass going to GSW made it impossible for the Cavs continued success.  That's most likely the reason that he's the #1 enemy. Fuck that guy.  I'll go through Cleveland's honorable mentions, to the best of my ability as well:  Carlos Boozer: He was on his rookie contract.  Had an option for a 5th year (or 4th?  I don't remember... whatever).   Cavs let him out, under the impression that he was going to stay, and sign a real deal for more money.  He reneged on his handshake deal and went to Utah instead, and we never got a young LeBron / Boozer duo.   Fuck that guy.   Jae Crowder:  I'm a little out of the loop on this.  Not sure why Cavs fans hate him.   If someone can fill me, that'd be great.  Kelly Olynk:  Ripped Kevin Love's arm out of his socket, in the 2015 playoffs, making the Cavs 2nd or 3rd best player unavailable in the finals.   Fuck that guy.  Joakim Noah: Is just a generally annoying-as-fuck player who's also explicitly talked shit about the city of Cleveland.   Fuck that guy.  Draymond:  Seriously?   He runs around kicking everyone in the dick.  Fuck that guy.  Terry Rozier:   I'm not sure what the deal is with this one either.  Again, if someone could fill me in, I'd probably happily say ""Fuck that guy.""  Mikki Moore:  Was a dirty ass motherfucker during the Cavs / Nets series in the 2007 conference semis.   Fuck that guy.  Jordan:  I mean, shit.   ""The Shot"" over Ehlo is enough alone.   But aside from that one singular ball-stabbing play, there was a solid 3-4 year window, where the Cavs were really fucking good, with Larry Nance, Mark Price, Ron Harper, Hot-Rod Williams, and a few others that I'm forgetting.   They were never able to get over the hump and play in the finals, soley because of Jordan.  In the same way that other teams have been dad-dicked by LeBron or Kobe... Jordan did that to the Cavs.   But... I can't give Jordan an official ""Fuck that guy.""  I mean... he's just Jordan."
You forgot Terry Rozier and Bubbler Herro.
"yeah this is a good one, if anything the most commonly discussed things are Kawhi's shot against the 76ers and Kyrie performances that year, but tbf the whole celtics team had lots of drama, i totally buy that morris and terry rozier were doing just as much to stir up shit as kyrie.   the 2-0 choke against the raptors, especially in game 3, is one of the biggest ones that is often overlooked. a number of NBA observers have mentioned that the Bucks were minutes away from being up 3-0 and going to the finals. if that happened, the narrative on both the Bucks and the Raptors would've been totally different."
They're good players but they aren't stars. Is Terry Rozier a star? Is Jae Crowder or Miles Bridges stars? Nah it doesn't matter what you're role is. You gotta be a top player to be a star and neither of them are stars.
"Terry Rozier can do one of those things, are you interested Miami??? Please????"
Charlotte fans should be ecstatic they got Terry Rozier and Lamelo the way I am about not having cap space
Graham is a damn good all-around PG but isn't really that great of a scorer other than shooting 3s. Good passer and acceptable defense for a 6'1 guy. Plus he's like 26 already which makes him fairly expendable for a rebuilding team.  Monk is a very weird player but his potential is through the roof. He's insanely strong for a guard and seems to have finally developed a consistent shot. Also has shown to be an extremely creative passer the few chances he gets to be the primary ball handler. Both Clifford and Borrego have found ways to shaft him out of the lineup which is just bizarre considering he's always outperformed his spot in the rotation and the analytics nerds love him.  I've always criticized Terry but he's still a solid rotational player. At the 2 he's one of the premier catch and shoot guys in the league but don't expect much in the way of playmaking or defense. Definitely won't be sad about trading him though  As for Simmons I'd definitely get experimental and play him at the 4 or 5 with Lamelo/Rozier/Bridges/Washington. That's a lineup with excellent playmaking and deadly spacing
They had a decent team in the early 90s with Alonzo Mourning but their issue is bad team management. Mitch Kupchak is looking like he’s putting the team in the right direction. LaMelo Ball is a franchise cornerstone. And Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier have been good pick ups.
"Giannis at 15 brings this draft up a *lot.* Lowkey I think 2015's not looking so hot either, now that Kristaps is kind of meh and DLo hasn't really proven much since that one year with the Nets. Not much depth in that one either, it's Booker and KAT and then DLo and Kristaps and then, like, Kelly Oubre? Terry Rozier? Myles Turner?"
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
He got some Terry Rozier in his game
"&gt;I said he can't get too much credit for getting a player right in the top 3  Why cant he? He absolutely nailed those picks in a way  no other team (besides Cleveland) with 2 top 3 picks has. How many teams have absolutely whiffed on top 3 picks? And neither of those picks were obvious choices either. Brown especially was considered a reach and Ainge was heavily criticized for that pick.   And the reason I brought those up was because he said that Massai wasnt Ainge when it came to draft picks. You can criticize Ainge for his drafting, but hes nailed the top of the draft in ways few people have.   If you want later picks we got:  Terry Rozier Timelord  Pritchard  Tony Allen Gerald Green Avery Bradley"
"Swap that, Terry Rozier especially at Cavs Arena turns into Stephen Curry, helps his team come back, and in 2020 season, almost had a game winner."
Terry... fucking... Rozier
"Yeah he’s a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
It's probably guys like Terry Rozier and Gary Trent Jr.
Who gives a single flying fuck about Terry Rozier and Devonte Graham when Cade Cunningham is available?
Terry Rozier deserves a mention just bc of how much the deal was slammed. Has earned every cent and more thus far
"""Jayson Tatum led the Celtics to Game 7 of the conference finals when he was just a rookie.""  The Celtics' playoff run in 2018 was built on great defense and a balanced scoring attack. That team had no stars. Tatum's impact wasn't any larger than Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Al Horford, or even Marcus Morris."
"I know that assists tend to be credited pretty loosely as you pointed out at the end, but this is just... Geez. Simmons definitely got more than a few generous ""assists"" from the score keepers last night.  This is also a good example of why looking at pure assist numbers to try to determine who is a better passer is a pretty bad way of going about it. Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier for example averaged roughly the same number of assists last season(4.1 APG for Hayward vs 4.2 for Rozier), but based on their time in BOS as well as the Hornets' games I watched last season tells me that Hayward is still the much better passer, despite the two having very similar APG and AST:TO ratios."
terry rozier
"He was scapegoated but he was also pretty shit.   They had a lot of issues and he was only responsible for some of them.   For example, in one of the early games against Boston in the 2018 series these were the primary defensive assignments:  * 6'3 Redick (with a 6'2 wingspan) on Tatum  * Slow-footed Covington on lightning-quick Terry Rozier * Simmons resting against an easier assignment in Smart * Saric struggling on Horford   Jaylen was injured for that game and yet Philly still struggled to contain our 1-4 purely because Brett Brown had misunderstood all our players. They had enough bodies to defend our guys if they used those guys correctly.  Tatum was a top 4 pick purely based on his ability to abuse mismatches against small white guys in college. Terry Rozier's breakout that season was 50% improving his shooting and 50% learning to control his insane speed.  Normally we would have schemed to get the mismatches he was giving us on a silver platter.   I remember as a fan being insulted by how poorly organised those 76ers were coming into the series. The same way it felt insulting when Budenholzer kept playing drop coverage against Durant in the recent MIL/BRK series.  He didn't deserve all the blame but he did need to go."
That's what I was thinking originally thinking but I don't think CJ is enough. Like is CJ and Embiid really any better or make you a championship contender? I think you roll the dice that Ben has some pride and works really hard on his game after this playoffs.   I think the best trade would be Zach Levine plus filler for Simmons and a first. Or maybe Terry Rozier?
I still remember sitting a ski resort and the whole place watching that game where Terry Rozier and Khris Middleton went back and forth and Middleton hit some insane deep 3 to tie or win.
I see John Collins shops at the same place Terry Rozier does
"What are you talking about? Pretty much the only negative things Rozier said about coaching/the organization was that they catered to Kyrie and Hayward to some extent at his expense.   For example, he said “Whatever Kyrie wants done, he’s gonna show it. That’s what he wants done. And you have to adjust” while complaining about the organization/coaching staff “treating Gordon and Kyrie — I wouldn't say different than everybody else — but I feel like they just treated them like they was on that level where there were no adjustments that could be made”.   He straight up recognizes that “Coach was in a tough position, one of the toughest positions” and said that his game plans weren’t being followed. He implied it was Kyrie not doing so and ended up outright saying it in a later interview along with the fact that Kyrie seemed to think he was a coach and acted like it.  Quotes should all be in the sources below:  https://sports.yahoo.com/celtics-mess-of-a-season-rooted-in-kyrie-irving-and-the-franchises-obsession-with-the-future-063908327.html  https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/05/14/terry-rozier-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-nba-free-agency/?amp  https://www.audacy.com/weei/blogs/nick-friar/rozier-talks-brad-stevens-and-kyrie-irvings-relationship"
Trade him for anyone thats fits better. Replace him with Terry Rozier were in the ECF right now
Anyone know what he is expected to get coming off that injury?  A Terry Rozier type contract maybe?
I remember when Terry Rozier was a future superstar based on a good playoff run
"&gt;To add on, here are the same stats for the players who just missed the cut:  &amp;#x200B;  |Player|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG|TS%|TPG|\# of Game 7s played|Record in Game 7s| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Jamal Murray|24.3|4.3|4.5|0.5|0.0|52.02%|2.3|4|3-1| |Draymond Green|19.3|11.0|5.3|1.5|1.3|66.79%|3.0|4|2-2| |Blake Griffin|20.0|8.8|5.0|1.0|1.2|56.74%|3.0|5|3-2| |Terry Rozier|10.0|4.7|3.7|1.0|0.7|47.89%|0.7|3|2-1|  Why were these players removed from the list?

Holiday is like an overpaid 2018 Terry Rozier
Shout out to Terry Rozier.
"2018 was a long time ago my man. Al Horford was a 31 year old all-star, Terry Rozier was balling tf out, and Joel Embiid wasn't an MVP candidate.  I agree that Tatum and Brown will be significantly better than they were, but what does Boston have outside of that? They have no identity at the moment, and it doesn't make sense to believe in them until they do."
Terry Rozier is my personal #1
Nahhh Terry Rozier!!
It probably wasn’t just only Kyrie’s fault tbf. Terry Rozier also played a big part in it by refusing to play his role. When Kyrie and Hayward got traded it was with the assumption that they would be the stars but Hayward barely got run for them   And Kemba was just a stupid panic signing because the Celtics were delusionally trying to replicate Kyrie. It wasn’t karma it was just a very risky and poor decision
Could they trade for Terry Rozier? He seems like a good fit.
"Last time we had pick 16 we got   Guerschon Yabusele Terry Rozier Lucas Noguira   Total crapshoot, I liked Giddey but I’m fine not drafting anyone for a year"
U want terry rozier back?
Hindsight is 20/20 though.  At the time nobody blinked at Kemba getting a max and the Sixers overpaid to the point of absurdity on Horford.  I'll add in that the second most laughed at contract that offseason was probably Terry Rozier.  Only with the power of hindsight do we see the Celtics would've been better off with Rozier and Horford than Kemba.
"To Charlotte, for Terry Rozier."
Terry rozier
"So in a way, they turned Terry Rozier, Al Horford, Kyrie Irving,.Lbs Walker, Gordon Hayward and a first round pick into older Al Horford.   NEAT"
Don't forget Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier
Lol that's outside stuff it doesn't matter and the Celtics stuff he gets to much flack the reports were that there were so much competition that it got toxic guys like Marcus Morris and Terry rozier were a cause too. Kyrie demanding a trade is not a losing attitude that's literally winning attitude he wanted to lead his own team which he did . the Cavs being trash when was younger should not be on him the roster was ass and young. Kyrie is a winner it's sad that you can't see it 2016 he showed up big and he had great moments in his cavs playoffs run.
Terry Rozier should still be a Celtic. Al should still be a Celtic.   Fuck the Kyrie experiment even though it's a deal you make 10/10 times.
https://www.nba.com/stats/players/roll-man/ Throughout this year he's ranked as a lower percentile as a roll man than notorious studs such as Terry Rozier and Jahlil Okafor. 2.6% frequency with a .8 points per possession.
"I appreciate you showing the respect owed to Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges and Terry Rozier.   They’re definitely as good as KAT, DLo, and Beasley but I respect a T Wolves fan for saying it"
"PJ Washington/Draymond Green/Miles Bridges/Terry Rozier/LaMelo Ball would actually be a really cool small ball starting five. If Rozier or Ball learned to defend, the switchability of that unit would be interesting.   Sub Rozier for Oubre for defense and everyone in that lineup is 6'7 except for Bridges (6'6), and you'd have 3 guys with 7'2+ wingspans.   Now I want to see that, Philly should trade us Simmons"
D’Lo a top 10 passer in the league but in everyone’s heads he’s just like fucking Terry Rozier or Bledsoe with bigger blinders
"I do think it begs an interesting discussion on what makes a ""good"" shooting guard. Rozier is a guy who pretty much did all you could ask offensively outside of supplemental playmaking - he shot incredibly efficiently, he created buckets when the offense broke down or defense was tight, and he was a go-to, reliable scorer in the closing minutes of tight games.  But compared to the all-star level guards, he was overall negative defensively and was not good at creating/recognizing scoring opportunities for others when he caused the defense to react or collapse.   But when someone shoots and scores as efficiently as Terry, how much does that matter? Especially if you can form a team that covers those gaps?"
Terry Rozier a mentor... I'm so confused
Terry Rozier is truly scary vs the Cavs.
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about that. There aren’t many good free agents available and the projected cap increase is going to mean that teams have money.   I just looked at available 2022 free agents and outside of James Harden (PO), Bradley Beal (PO), Kyrie Irving (PO), and Zach LaVine, Terry Rozier might arguably be the best unrestricted free agent available. The only guys he’s really competing with is Aaron Gordon. It’s a pretty empty free agent class. Everyone is just re-signing with their original teams.   **TL,DR:** There aren’t many good free agents next year. Outside of Harden, Beal, Irving, and LaVine, Terry Rozier might be the best UFA available. His only real competition is Aaron Gordon."
"I feel pretty good about that. Terry took the leap once he was allowed to play more off ball and as a secondary ball handler. LaMelo is only going to get better at playmaking, so I think there's a fair chance Rozier continues to benefit. His catch and shoot 3 point shooting is elite, and he's in his prime."
I really think your discounting the leadership he provides. Rozier and Hayward have both been further in the playoffs than any other player on our team. The Hornets biggest flaw last season was inexperience leading to losing winnable games and Terry provides leadership and drive.

Terry Rozier 😩
"Rozier is definitely not far off from JC as you think. I honestly think rozier is more valuable to the hornets than JC is valuable to the hawks. Rozier made huge leaps during his hornets tenure. At times he looks like MJ. He looks just that unstoppable at times. If Brandon Jennings and Michael Jordan had a kid, it would be Terry Rozier."
terry has been efficient for literally half a season in his entire career   smart impacts winning a lot more than rozier does

"Grouped with comparable SG contracts from this season.  | | Pts | Reb | Ast | TS% | Contract AAV | Yrs | |-|----|-----|-----|------|--------------|----| | Will Barton | 15.1 | 6.3 | 3.7 | .538 | 16 | 2 | | Hardaway Jr. | 16.6 | 3.3 | 1.8 | .589 | 18 | 4 | | Evan Fournier | 19.7 | 2.9 | 3.7 | .584 | 18.25 | 4-1 | | Terry Rozier | 20.4 | 4.4 | 4.2 | .575 | 24 | 4 |  So to me it doesn't look great.  One wrinkle, though - this is an extension, so it doesn't kick in until '22-'23. So the real measuring stick for the value of this extension is what shooting guards are getting next off-season, when I believe the cap is 5 million higher, which may change the dynamics a little."
“Terry Rozier sideburns” wasn’t something I thought I’d Google today
"In terms of age, in theory, sure.  In terms of actual development - Rozier has improved much more significantly over each of the last 2 years than Collins.  Collins could take a leap, but he's starting to look kind of like he is what he is.  Not sure Terry is done improving yet."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"The Charlotte Hornets have reached an agreement with guard Terry Rozier on a four-year, $97 million maximum contract extension through the 2025-26 NBA season.  Aaron Turner, Rozier's agent, confirmed the "
"It's an overpay by about 5-million a year but Terry is worth that money. He's a clutch-af shooter.  The thing is though that part of why Terry's so solid is because he's an undersized shooting guard that's paired with a jumbo playmaker in LaMelo. LaMelo can guard bigger players so they work out fine.  Rozier didn't play with LaMelo his first season in Charlotte and the backcourt was him and Devonte Graham, which led to a lot of complaints similar to what we're seeing with Sexton and Garland right now.  I think that'll also make his contract harder to trade in the future for that reason. Not only is he getting overpaid, but you need to work around his defensive woes if you're a team trying to trade for him."

"I agree with the first part, but the 50% part in 11-30 I disagree with.  Since 2011 he drafted  MarShon Brooks at 25, Jared Sullinger at 21, Fab Melo at 22, James Young at 17, Terry Rozier at 16, RJ Hunter at 28, Yabusele at 16, Ante Zizec at 23, Rob Williams at 27, Romeo Langford at 14, Grant Williams at 22, Nesmith at 14, And Pritchard at 26  Of those 13, I think it’s fair to say only Rozier, Rob Williams and Pritchard have been great picks, with the potential for Nesmith to join them if he plays more like he did this summer league than last season.   Grant Williams and Langford have not looked good, but are still in the league, with Langford having more upside than Williams."

Get you somebody who loves you as much as Michael Jordan loves Terry Rozier
"&gt; but I don't see the point of talking up Danny's acumen if he wasn't really able to accrue those benefits from the pick.  Because it shows he's a good evaluator of talent?   In 5 consecutive years, he drafted Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams.   All 5 of those guys are going to be making at least 15 mill per year starting next year and are all Top 100 players in the league."
Terry Rozier. Really. Huh.
For example. Last year Terry Rozier was absolutely horrific when he wasn't sharing the floor with Graham and having him create for Terry. This year while not having anyone to create for himself Terry was a lot more efficient and very clutch.  That type of production seems unsustainable compared to last year which is why I saw a significant number of Hornets fans hoping he would be dealt because his value is at an all time high.
"Different kinds of players, Schroder is a slasher, Rozier is a shooter. Terry is a terrible 2-point scorer, but he's a great shooter considering the difficulty of the shots he takes."
"Terry's honestly a really gifted player. tough ass shot maker, athletic, solid defensively even if he's shorter. he may take some bad shots but would you rather have Terry for this money or McCollum for 35? i think as a two player who doesn't get picked on, Rozier is really good."
"*Dennis Schroder wakes up in the middle of night sweating*  “Man, I had a nightmare Terry Rozier got the same deal I turned down”  *‘Scary’ Terry pops his head out of the closet wearing a Jason mask.*  “That’s Tough 💯🔥”"
The price you pay to keep Eric Collins and Terry Rozier together
They would but not at the extent of other guys. Unless you Stan someone like Terry Rozier
"you say 3rd best guard as if being just a bit worse than Terry Rozier and LaMelo Ball is a bad thing.   I would personally have traded Rozier before dumping either of Graham or Monk. I'm expecting a noticeable step back in Charlotte without those two, unless LaMelo blows up big time. Devonte' is a legitimate floor general that makes his teammates better, if you want to take a look at our on/off numbers."
I'm see a bit of Terry Rozier with better defense.
"He's not an easy player to slot into any given lineup honestly. Also it doesn't help that being an 11M expiring makes you a very, very easy contract to trade.   Pros: Great defense, secondary ballhandler, great shooter from 3  Cons: Poor playmaker relative to his position, injury prone, probably a bit overpaid considering his role, age and injury history  He's a Terry Rozier type where he needs to be paired with a bigger playmaker to really unlock his effectiveness and that really hurts when we're in a league that usually needs its point-guard-sized players to handle a majority of the ball-handling and playmaking duties."
This is just my skewed view on what I’d expect from each pick by using a player and their accolades/skill  1 - John Wall   2-5/6 - Al Horford/Mike Conley level  6-10 -Wiggins  11-14 - Terry Rozier before he left Boston  Past Lottery you should be happy with a starter/25mpg level guy imo
"They've been one of the smarter organizations in the league for about four years now, it's hard to name all the good moves.  They flipped Shai for Miles Bridges and a couple picks.  They got Gordon Hayward on a bargain contract, then flipped Kemba for draft picks and Terry Rozier (who's averaging 20ppg on high efficiency).   Even this year Bouknight and Jones both looked good in summer league and seem perfect for the run-and-gun style they like with Hayward and Lamelo as ball handlers, and I really like the Kelly Oubre signing for them too."
"Which Is going to be used to bring home, you guessed it, Terry Rozier"
ok i will drop it after this - an example is terry rozier over the first 34 games of the season he had 65% ts with shooting splits of 45/46/80. he ended up with 57.5% ts. its a simple fact that 34 games is not enough for shooting splits to stablilize.  I even started my comment by saying this is not about Ant specifically lol.  Bummer that neither math or reading are strengths of yours.
Terry Rozier Game 7 ECF 2018
"I agree with everything you said except that Bledsoe sucked on defense last year. He has actually sucked for the last 3-4 years.  I don't care that the he made an All defense team. That was more a product of the bucks being a good defensive unit together, Bledsoe never scared anyone on defense ask Terry Rozier"
"Kyrie only missed 37 regular season games on the Celtics. Using the 2019-2020 season with Kemba, an improved Tatum and Brown, and an overall drastically different roster is a dishonest analysis of the data.   The 2017 Celtics faced extremely weak competition in the playoffs and got away with having Terry Rozier as their #1 option (surely you don’t believe Rozier was better than Kyrie in 2017?) In 2018 the Bucks were a 60-win 1st seed, Kyrie didn’t play well but no one else did either and the Celtics were hardly expected to win that series.   Most people don’t call Kyrie a superstar unless it’s to discredit the Nets super team. And I don’t know what a “legit” #1 option looks like, but he’s at least every bit as good as Booker, Mitchell, and Beal, who are pretty good 1st options to me."
"Boston - Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Terry Rozier  76ers - Maxey, Thybulle, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, Milton  LOL, you're in a fucking cult"
"I think KAT is overlooked due to his last couple seasons being filled with injury. I also think that Terry Rozier has been pretty underrated, given his very solid season that he had last year."
Since we talking bout people that don’t get mentioned much I’m going with terry rozier
"De'aron Fox, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris"

Celtics Bucks with Terry Rozier vs Drew Bledsoe
He's also a SG in a PG's body. Terry Rozier with upside and needs to be placed next to a jumbo playmaker to offset that.
"Terry Rozier  Yes, he might actually be the best player on the market depending on what happens with Harden, Kyrie and Beal. I expect Harden and Kyrie to sign extensions and Beal’s situation to be resolved this season some time. Next year is looking real bleak for free agency."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"&gt;irst, you are flatly wrong. That Nets pick turned into Collin Sexton. It was 8th in the draft.  You're right, that's my bad.  Still, give me the option of taking Kyrie or the 8th pick in the draft I'm taking Kyrie. Every time.   &amp;#x200B;  And Terry Rozier was more than happy to stay in Boston, they could've just paid him. They didn't ""need"" to get Kemba."
"The offensive poise doesn’t surprise me. He was praised before the draft for his movement, IQ, and instincts on that end, and he won Turkish League MVP with those factors at his back. What has surprised me is the defense; he’s not a plus yet, but he doesn’t look like someone with bricks for feet like Sabonis, a low-awareness player like Oubre, or a low-motor guy like Terry Rozier. He’s playing at game speed on that end and seems to have a good idea on how to move/rotate, plus he’s giving good effort. If he can be a consistent high-effort defender and develop his IQ on that end, I see him as a league average guy who isn’t the liability he was feared to be."

Actually the Hornets did a sign and trade with the Celtics with Kemba to get Terry Rozier.
"The last time we mocked a team for doing this the Hornets let Kemba walk.   And they ended up turning Kemba into a great contract for Terry Rozier who was one of the clutchest shooters last season.   So maybe we should wait and see who wins the sign and trade.  If the Pelicans end up with   Schroder, Graham, Ingram, Zion, Jonas  that is one HELL of a starting 5"
"Congratulations on taking the time to Google that. They made it to G7 in an ECF with Terry Rozier. Meanwhile, Simmons scored one point in a playoff game against the Celtics that exact same postseason lol. To quote Embiid ""It's not a rivalry. They always kick our ass."""
The Celtics lost Hayward and Kyrie and still made it further in the playoffs with Terry Rozier than the Sixers ever have with Embiid. They're delusional.
"The Hornets signing Terry Rozier to a 3 year 58 Million Dollar contract. Especially, since they decided not to extend Kemba Walker to a more than Max contract   Two years later, Terry Rozier is underpaid and Boston had to trade the 16th pick in the draft in order to get off of Kemba’s contract."
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
And will end up with the return of Terry Rozier once Beal signs the extension. *sigh*
Watch them miss out and panic and sign Terry Rozier to a max deal
Would you rather have Terry Rozier or Denis Schroder?
Terry Rozier nods
"It’s funny you mention context being tough for me when you were straight up ignoring context to get your point across (on top of being a dick for no reason than being a little bitch).   You’re pretending I said his finals run was trash and only using stats and context to help you while ignoring the HOFers he had to go through in 2009 and pretending that dropping 40 on the likes of Terry Rozier is some kind of flex.  Why don’t you pick up a copy of Emily fucking Post and stop acting like a subjective opinion is some kind of flex, you Neanderthal."
"He's a nice facilitator in a Marc Gasol type sense. Just a net positive in terms of ball movement which seems like a big gain considering Celtics fan often complained about their ball movement   He's had some very light success at maning Giannis in his previous stint with the Celtics. I doubt he can hold up anymore but he's another body that can somewhat compete with him physically.  Crazy how they've been hemorrhaging so many starter quality players (Horford, Kemba, Hayward, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier, Kyrie Irving) yet are still a solid team."
"You know what's going to happen right?   All this cap space will result in us...bringing back Terry Rozier.   In 2022 our starting 5 will be Rozier, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Timelord, and Danny Ainge will smile from the heavens below as that 5 contains each one of his draft picks from 2014-18.   And that team will be a 4 seed at best."
"Don't see that being close for Charlotte, after letting two offensive guards just walk away, we're gonna trade our leading scorer and three point marksman for a career 38/32/78 shooter? Punting Monk and Graham seemed like the ultimate act of confidence in Terry Rozier by Kupchak. A stupid one, but there's no way he is traded now."
Marcus Smart for Terry Rozier who says no?
How you gunna disrespect Terry Rozier and Dennis Schroder like that
"Yea it’s definitely this. A role player in his mid 20s isn’t thinking ‘what’s the quickest way to win’, they’re more likely thinking ‘how can I ensure I get the best contract in the future’. A kid like Nunn knows he has more to gain with one season of being a role player in a title contender and then probably opting out if he does well in the hope that a smaller team tries to pay him/give him a bigger role. Nunn could easily have a career trajectory like Terry Rozier or something if he has a good season at the Lakers. Which is great for a kid who went undrafted a couple years ago."
"Entering the 2017-18 season we had:  Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes.  We also controlled the rights to Sacramento's draft pick in 2019 and had the Grizzlies first-round pick protected 1-7 until 2021.   It was such a ridiculous position to be in that Zach Lowe at that time called it maybe the greatest rebuild in the history of the NBA coming off the KG-Pierce trade where we blew it up.   Now, only 3 of those players remain, and both of those draft picks that were thought to be treasured assets turned into late-lottery picks. It's unbelievable.   Curse of IT is/was real. Let's hope it's ended now that Danny is gone."
they are about to trade wiseman and curry for terry rozier my sources tell me
They had a million opportunities to trade for a star but kept letting Terry Rozier be a deal-breaker. Miami is making moves to put themselves in the conversation. Maybe im biased but roster wise miami ends up 3rd best in the east depending on how riley fills out the rest of this
"Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier"
Point guard market has been inflated for years if a player is adequate enough that “terrible” for them is 3 20 point games in a series then they are good enough that they are the kind of guy who’ll get near that range. It’s Ricky Rubio/Terry Rozier money
"But you're wrong. Dont be so assertive with something you are incorrect about. Monk's injury largely coincided with Graham, Ball and Hayward's absences too. So he didnt get the opportunities and touches Rozier and say Bridges had  And he isnt just a point getter ffs. The dude is a positive defender (unlike Terry). The second best drive and kicker on the team and the 3rd best playmaker on the team behind Ball and Graham."
"Terry Rozier managed to make a move right at the moment Bledsoe looked over his shoulder for the screen.  It's bad defense and he was overly concerned about the screen, but noticing that made the awful defense slightly more rational"
"Yep Kyrie played pretty bad. Choked almost as bad that series as Jayson Tatum (36% FG, 2/16 from three), Gordon Hayward (34% FG), Terry Rozier (29% from the field, 3/19 from three), and of course Marcus Smart who made a whopping 1 basket."
If you think losing to Terry fucking Rozier in the playoffs isn't embarrassing then I truly wanna live in your fantasy world.
I mean you got beat by Terry Rozier and Shane Larkin.  That's pretty embarrassing.
Pj and a first is literally better than terry rozier as an asset and it’s a better fit than terry so if you don’t think the pacers would do it ur just saying ur trade that you proposed is bad.
"Not extending our QO to Monk is a stupid mistake by our shortsighted FO and why is I am still skeptical of Kupchak despite the majority of our fans sucking him off for doing nothing that significant. Overpaying for an injury prone Hayward and stretching Batum is not a positive thing. I'll give him his PJ, Miles and McDaniels picks but that's it. Fact is there's no one smart enough in that FO to tell them straight up that Terry is not the answer going forward. Too shit of a defender and does nothing of value other than three point shooting and tough shot making from time to time. Given the same opportunity and touches, Monk could have putting similar volume numbers but with better defense.  It doesn't save us anything financially.  At least give him a lowball offer if you don't want him. There was nothing to gain by just letting him walk?   And by this time next year, we're gonna overpay for the worse and more replaceable Rozier.   ----   A team with smart management on and off the court will give him the 25+ MPG he should have gotten here and he'll be a 16-20 PPG scorer with positive defense, while we go out and overpay Terry Rozier once again next offseason   Just a real shame.    Rant over. Hope Bouknight is ready and good enough soon"
"[ok you can just go through the list then. ](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/page/2/seasontype/4)  Derrick white, fultz, Terry rozier."
"You can’t sit here and say well among PG I have him as 17th in the whole league and out of the other side of the mouth say he should play next to someone who can be more on the ball in the half court. If you look at just guards there are so many, so many guards you’d rather have. You don’t have Booker on your list? You don’t have Jamal Murray? Donovan Mitchell? Beal? Lavine? Irving? Harden? Brown? McCollum?   Like who did he have a better season than last year? Was he better than terry rozier? Was be better than FVV? Tim Hardaway and Norman Powell are both coming off two very strong seasons in a row, both FA, both 28, was Lonzo better than either of them? Let’s just be honest."
Some fans don’t even keep up and still speak their opinions!  Half of r/nba still thinks Terry Rozier is a bad player I bet.
Agreed. Pelicans are getting a great player in terry rozier which will help them win now. They don’t have lonzo. He’s just to match salary. The trade is essentially Hayes for rozier.
Can I interest you in 1 Patrick Beverley and 1 second pick in exchange for 1 Terry Rozier? Pls

"That’s because he was supposed to be guarding Bledsoe, so effectively had free reign to float around making everyone else’s life difficult because Bledsoe wasn’t gonna punish it. Terry Rozier and Goran Dragic looked top-tier defensively in that matchup too.  That’s not to say he isn’t actually good or anything, but that’s definitely not the example to use to make your point."
"i didn't express it very well but i mentioned those players as a way to recognise that there is a point, in roster construction, where scoring becomes less valuable  but honestly i don't really think what you're talking about is really that big a problem. rudy gobert only averaged 14.3ppg last season compared to, say, terry rozier who average 20ppg, and just about everyone would agree rudy is the better player"

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"I don't care at all how much any of these people make, but it's insane to just deny facts here. Stephen A. Smith is one of the biggest five names in sports media. I'm totally on board with Taylor betting on herself. You do you. I like her a lot. I think she's talented, she's pleasant to look at, and comes from the sports world. And all that said, she isn't Steven A. Smith. We'd laugh at Terry Rozier nonstop if he said ""I want to make LeBron James money"" if he turned down a pretty big contract offer. What's the difference?"

"we still don't have a quality center rotation. Plumlee is ok, but a bottom 10 starter, and there's no guarantee any of Jones/Carey/Richards are good enough to rely on for rotation minutes. We will likely be giving PJ Washington center minutes out of necessity again. I'm hopeful for Jones in the future, but he's a raw prospect at the moment.    We are also doomed if LaMelo or Rozier misses significant time, as we lost the two good players that would relieve them, and replaced them with Ish Smith, who can't score much. Last year, Graham and Monk could be trusted to step in and pour in some points off the bench, there's no guarantee Bouknight is ready to step in and give us anywhere near that kind of production if Rozier misses games.  It was a weird offseason. Keeping Hayward, re-signing Terry, and acquiring some 30+ yo vets imply that we're trying to compete right now, but crippling the bench unit offense and being content with Plumlee as a starter without a reliable backup gives the opposite message. If we were to compete, we needed to reconstruct and reinforce the center position this offseason, we just stuck some duct tape on it instead."
that's terry rozier money!
"“Weak ass conference finals appearances” - beating Giannis, Middleton, Embiid, Simmons and then losing to LeBron is apparently expected to be light work for rookie Tatum, sophomore Brown and 6th man Terry Rozier. Not to mention beating Embiid again and fighting through one of the most competitive 7-game series we’ve seen vs the Raptors in the bubble.    Brown in 2018 was not a second option, either - he was the leading scorer for the Celtics at 19.7ppg in the Conference finals that went to game 7. Simmons meanwhile in his closest seasons was a fucking 5th option and was getting carried by Butler and Embiid at the top of their games.  And let’s keep in mind the reason everybody came down to earth on Simmons — this man had the easiest path to an ECF he’s ever had, playing a 5th seed Hawks team with homecourt advantage and an MVP level teammate. Complete choke job, everybody is shocked and everybody now knows he doesn’t have what it takes.  So yes, I do count Brown leading a team one game from the Finals as more of an achievement than Simmons disappearing in the 2nd round time after time."
"Chris Paul  Smart/Schroder  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons   Kyle Lowry  Harden (or Kyrie)  Lonzo  Conley  Dejounte Murray  Devonte' Graham  Jamal Murray  Patrick Beverley  Brogdon  Rubio  Terry Rozier (or LaMelo)  Lillard  Westbrook  Luka  Sexton  who here is Curry objectively a better defender than?  because if he's not better than at least 4 or 5 of them, he is below average.  that is how average works lol"
"I was an example to show that this team was not built around Kyrie, it's a mix out of two different approaches which doesn't fit. Steven's O by giving the ball to a guard (worked with It) and the wing heavy o they play now. Kemba had the same problems in this regard like Kyrie and with IT Brown had that problem. Those teams are build around nothing. They had a plan but the picks panned out in a whole different way. Never have both the Jay's and their Scoring guard have been good at the same time (works for It, lT, Kyrie, Kemba and even Terry Rozier)."
I highly doubt the best and more established players are going to want to play. $1m is enough for them to risk injury. But this would be interesting for the bottom rotation guys on teams that need that kind of money though. But you’d never see the Lebrons in this. I doubt you’d even see guys like Terry Rozier.
2018 playoffs Terry Rozier
"That's great in theory, except that Dallas won't have cap space either. The article makes the point that it doesn't look like anybody really will:  &gt; On Aug. 15, HoopsHype's [Yossi Gozlan](https://twitter.com/YossiGozlan/status/1426990210735173637?s=19) projected that seven teams would have cap space next offseason. Since then, four of those teams have cut into that space significantly. Boston extended several players, Charlotte extended Terry Rozier and signed Kelly Oubre, New Orleans re-signed Josh Hart and Detroit acquired and waived DeAndre Jordan. The remaining three all have meaningful players whose possible extensions could and likely will cut into their space as well: Memphis has Jaren Jackson, San Antonio has Lonnie Walker and Orlando has Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter.   Now it's always possible some teams could shuffle things around to try to open up space for Beal or LaVine, but until that happens it's not much of a bluff on their part to say ""trade me or I'll walk."""
&gt; I gotta admit I wouldn't want to be a Cavs fan right now.  Sorry but this is a bit rich coming from a Pacers fan. The Cavs future is still pretty bright with the amount of young guys on the team. They should be entertaining this year even if the wins aren't there yet. I still think 30 wins is possible though depending on injuries. I don't want to be stuck in the 7-10 seed every year.  &gt; -Undersized backcourt with an undersized shooting guard looking for more money than Terry Rozier.   I'm assuming you are talking about Sexton here. There is no indication he is asking for the moon in contract negotiations. All speculation right now. And Sexton is better than Rozier anyway.  &gt; -Logjam in the frontcourt with players who can't shoot (and don't tell me that Jarrett Allen can space the floor yet he's averaged 0.1 3PA/game for his career).  Logjam of who? Allen isn't meant to space the floor with his shot. He's a great PnR guy with good hands that plays defense. Mobley and Markkanen can absolutely space the floor. And if Love plays he can too.   &gt; -I honestly have no idea how Lauri fits into this. He's basically a black hole on defense.   Clearly the Cavs are taking a chance here but Markkanen will finally get to play with a true PG and just needs to hit threes which he did well last year.  &gt; -Kevin Love's contract for 2 more seasons; dude has shown no inclination to take a buyout.  Doesn't really matter. The Cavs don't ever get huge names in free agency and don't need the cap space. He can sit on the bench for 2 years or play a few minutes. It doesn't really matter either way.
I gotta admit I wouldn't want to be a Cavs fan right now.  -Undersized backcourt with an undersized shooting guard looking for more money than Terry Rozier. Same case of where he actively needs to be paired with a big playmaker to unlock his full potential.  -Logjam in the frontcourt with players who can't shoot (and don't tell me that Jarrett Allen can space the floor yet he's averaged 0.1 3PA/game for his career).  -I honestly have no idea how Lauri fits into this. He's basically a black hole on defense.   -Kevin Love's contract for 2 more seasons; dude has shown no inclination to take a buyout.
"Jayson Tatum.  He's trash compared to people's opinion of him, especially Celtics fans. He takes bad shots And a lot of them. He doesn't create good looks for his team mates. He takes away team mates opportunities. He's far too inconsistent, which again hurts the team, is he gonna shoot 3/20 tonight and get blown out by the Bulls, hit 3/15 and lose to the Wizards or go 20/30 and beat the Nets, who knows just roll a dice. Guess his teammates just hope Tatum pops off? Cause they aren't getting enough ball to get any rhythm going if he doesn't.  The more the Celtics rely on Tatum, and the less they have other players on court taking and creating shots the worse they do. I swear the Celtics roster should perform better every season, but they do worse year on year.  I also think that the way Tatum plays, he makes the players around him worse, like the opposite of the CP3 effect. Like for example, Evan Fornier joins the team and goes from scoing 19ppg to 13ppg despite the fact his shooting percentages went up. On the flip side, Thies had the opposite effect, he moved to the Bulls and his PPG went up, despite his 2pt% staying the same and his 3pt% going down... Look at everyone else who joined this team? Tristan Thompson went from 12ppg to 7ppg, Kemba went from 26ppg to 19ppg. Who could forget scary Terry? MF went from 9ppg to 20ppg. No player has joined this team and gotten better and all of them who left suddenly improved and everyone acts like it's a God damn mystery. Everyone just forgot the fact Rozier got a massive pay day? Dude looked great, but just never got his chance, and guess what he balled out when he was given the chance. If it wasn't predictable why did the Hornets pay him so much and let Kemba walk?   As Tatum's usage rate goes from 10% to 30%, the Celtics go from a Win % of 70% to 50%... Despite what everyone expected was to be the Celtics getting stronger every season due to their high draft stock and already strong roster with guys like Brown, Smart, Irving/Walker, while the team had Hayward on the roster taking the bulk of the salary space AND being out with injury.  He's a great player, with great potential, but his game has major floors which need to be fixed. He's an above average player, on an okay team. But jesus people suck him off like he's in MVP contention despite only going 36-36 with a very decent surrounding cast.   Like if you said to me 2 years ago, there will be a team with: Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, an All NBA calibur player, Jaylen Brown, Tristan Thompson starting and a bench of Fornier, Teague,  Parker, Williams and Thies, I'd say holy shit that's a top 4 team. But no just 7th in the East, 36-36 record. What?"
Terry Rozier*
Jalen Brown and Terry Rozier would like to forget they were on the Bachelorette in 2019
"Terry Rozier was (depending on your definitions of some ill-defined phrases there) all of those things. He's 1.5 inches taller, but had much less strength coming into the league (both players have fairly strongly plus wingspans). The difference is largely that Rozier got significantly better after coming into the league at passing and shooting and Carsen has struggled to reliably improve there. Carsen also had a much stronger history of successful college shooting than Rozier, but Rozier improved much more than Carsen did there. Sometimes, that's the difference - some guys improve their weaknesses in the league and some don't, which is why looking at a profile and just saying ""this type is never successful"" is wrong. I completely agree that looking at someone like Carsen and saying ""this player was always unlikely to be successful"" was a legitimate and good take."
No mention of Terry Rozier III… let’s read into that and over analyze it!

Ben for terry rozier and a first
Lamelo ball🥺  terry rozier😱  Kelly(😍😍)Oubre  Miles bridges😘  Random filler center
"Basically everyone on the Hornets is a wildcard. I think we know what Rozier and Plumlee are going to give us, but essentially everyone else has a fairly wide range of outcomes.   - Does Hayward play 70 or 35 games?   - Does LaMelo blow up into an all-star, stagnate as a quality starter, or does he have a sophomore slump?   - Does Miles Bridges pick up where he left off last season and continue giving us 17-20 points on ridiculous efficiency, or does he go back to underwhelming us when Hayward is healthy?   - Is Ish Smith good enough to be a quality 20+ min PG or is our bench going to be a disaster with no quality guards?   - Can Oubre be the aggressive 3&amp;D wing we've been missing for years or is he an underachiever like he was in GS?   - Are rookies Bouknight and Jones immediate contributors off the bench, or raw prospects that will hurt us in their minutes on the floor?   - Can PJ Washington make the jump from decent utility guy to legitimate starter, or is he just going to stay ""just a guy""?  --  It's really hard to pick one. I'm going to say Miles Bridges. imo, if you don't have an all-star on the team and you're trying to compete, you need 4-5 guys that can consistently give you 15-20 a night. Hayward, Terry, and LaMelo can when healthy, Miles becoming that 4th guy would be absolutely huge for us."
"Nah. The only thing that changed was a slight drop in his minutes because Bud rotates more.  His per 36 is almost identical between Phoenix and Milwaukee.  His reduced slashing is also overstated, more of his shots were around the rim in Milwaukee then they were his last few years (or entire time) in Phoenix, and almost twice as many of his points came off of assists in Milwaukee.  His problem in Milwaukee was his playoffs performance. He got outplayed by Terry Rozier in 2018, disappeared vs Toronto in 2019, and when Giannis went down against Miami in 2020 he stepped up and went 2-12 from the field to ultimately get eliminated from the playoffs and the Bucks."
Wait don’t you mean MJ and Terry Rozier?
Lonzo Ball would be an upgrade even tho this sub considers him worse.   D’Angelo Russell is someone who would have probably put them over   And underrated pick but Terry Rozier probably puts them over as well
Collin Sexton  Terry Rozier  CJ McCollum
"5 would be real tight for deep teams  Even Charlotte would have to leave some real solid prospects/players on the table.  LaMelo, Bridges, PJ Washington are the obvious ones, then we'd have to leave two of Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Kai Jones, or James Bouknight unprotected. I'm gonna protect the rookies but only 5 protected players will never happen for an expansion draft. Minimum 7, probably 8."
"I'd think of it as more of gang member sterotype. If JR Smith didn't used to do things like throw up gang signs, replace the letter c with the letter k or didn't have a ton of gang tattoos, I highly doubt that ""Henny"" joke would have become a thing.   Pietrus was goofy as hell but that joke wouldn't make sense applied to him, it would for someone like Terry Rozier though."

"Actual underrated players, not just hipster shit:  James Harden  Gordon Heyward  Karl-Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons  Clint Capela  RJ Barrett  Anthony Edwards  Terry Rozier  Malcolm Brogdon"
"I also saw Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, and Amir Johnson at the same store!"
Terry Rozier sound like 21 Savage lol
"No kidding. I was expecting 18-20 ppg to start the year, but he's averaging like 26 now.  Of course, Terry Rozier is out and so is PJ. once they come back Miles might drop to 20 or so. But he's over exceeding my expectations lol"
"My sister and I saw Terry Rozier in the Adidas employee store a few years ago. And as we were walking past, he was facetiming some girl and asked my sister for help, and the girl says ""can you tell me what color of green these are? Hard to tell through the phone"" and Terry just looked at us like ""sorry lol"". It was hilarious"
"Hornets, because I love terry rozier and miles bridges is fun af to watch"
My ideal offseason was sign him for like half of what terry was making and then trade terry for an actual bigman. Now we're still stuck without any quality big man and we are paying rozier 25m a yr starting next yr.
"Terry Rozier. Fuck Terry Rozier, be good against someone else for once"
"Terry Rozier and CJ, both unreal to watch when they’re hot and create as a secondary star."
he's talking about Terry Rozier
"I mean Lamelo is big enough to guard 2s. We saw it all last year when he played with 6’1 Terry Rozier. There would be some trouble on defense, but can you imagine the offensive potential a Curry-Lamelo backcourt would have? You pair one of the greatest off ball players with a dynamic playmaker who has generational vision and you have dynamite.   Imagine curry and Lamelo splitting ball handling duties and running plays like the Spanish pick and roll. If rozier was deadly with Lamelo on that play think of how insane curry would be. Think of the amount of easy buckets Curry would get.   Instead the warriors draft wiseman who doesn’t make up the difference on defense (evident by his atrocious defense last year) and is honestly doesn’t fit at all in the warriors offense. Whenever I hear people talk about how the warriors drafted wiseman over Lamelo for fit it always baffled me. Sure wiseman is technically a **positional** fit, but definitely not a **system** fit and in a league where positions matter less and less I think fair to say Lamelo is a much better fit for the warriors than Wiseman is.   Even if wiseman does pan out and become a solid starter or even an all star it’ll likely happen a few years down the line when curry is fast approaching 40 and Thompson and green are in their mid 30s. The warriors drafting Lamelo over wiseman will probably go down as the worst decision by the warriors front office in the curry era and will likely be responsible for shutting down their championship window."
"I honestly think we can go 82-0. I mean, would you look at this team? Let's start with the backcourt. You've got LaMelo ""Lamelon Baller"" Ball staring down Terry ""Scarence Terrence"" Rozier, slicing and dicing NBA defenses. Ish ""Prodigal Son of Charlotte"" Smith, locked in and ready to make defenders cry with his veteran smarts. James ""Bonknight"" Bouknight. Gordon ""Hair Jordan"" Hayward. When was the last time you saw a backcourt like that? And then the frontcourt. My god, it makes me weep tears of pure joy to read off these names. Miles ""Sky Miles"" Bridges. PJ ""The Capitol"" Washington. Mason ""Plumdog Millionaire"" Plumlee. Vernon ""Mount Vernon"" Carey.  And then the bench. Every time I look at this list I have to change my pants. I'm running out of pants. I'm going broke. Cody ""Which Martin is that?"" Martin. Kelly ""T$unami Papi"" Oubre. Thor. McDaniels. Jones. I'm running out of nicknames. Actually I had to go change my pants again. Lakers? They can go to the nursing home. The Hawks can fly off to the glue factory. Orlando has a team? This team doesn't follow the rules. It makes the rules. And they exercise the rule of law over the Eastern Conference. Read my lips, 82-0."
"They're missing Terry Rozier, for what it's worth."
"What is ""the best value"" for Simmons?  That's really the crux of the issue here, which everybody in the ""Trade him!"" camp seems to be ignoring.   If you're not getting a player who substantially improves your rotation, why make a deal? Who cares about, say, Washington's 2023 pick and Kyle Kuzma? Do you think there's realistically a better offer on the table than that?  Morey was never going to get a top 10 player for Simmons, but if he's not getting a borderline all-star (let's say, top 40 player) ... why should he bother?   Just for fun, let's use ESPN'S RPM (just for convenience, it's a pretty flawed measure) and count the players who you think have a current team would trade him for Simmons and would meaningfully improve the Sixers. Devontae Graham would help, but the Pels aren't making that trade. Terry Rozier would help, but Charlotte isn't making that trade. Fox appears to be off the table. How far down the list do you get before you find a trade that it actually seems like could get made?"
Terry rozier
"""Scary"" Terry Rozier."
"He's definitely in the position to bet on himself. The scoring is self-explanatory, but I believe when Garland was out last season he really bumped up his scoring numbers. If he can show that he can effectively run the point then that opens up his game a ton. If not, he's basically a supercharged Terry Rozier who needs a big playmaker next to him and those are kind of rare in today's league."
"You’re on crack If you’re about to compare Ray Allen to Terry Rozier! Christ, this is dumb. Ray Allen has led a bunch of teams far in the playoffs as the number one stop saying 10th seed crap, like that was all the time. You have no clue what the hell you are even talking about and you are so far off with your assessment on Ray Allen it’s honestly comical. Klay Thompson can’t be the number one because he can’t even create his own shot. He wouldn’t put up numbers like Ray Allen did if he was the number one option because he is not capable of doing it. He is a catch and shoot player that benefits with playing with Steph Curry. Ray Allen lead the Milwaukee bucks to the Eastern conference finals is the number one one game away from making the NBA finals, And he also lied a broken Seattle team before you got there far into the playoffs. I have no idea what you were talking about. He was seriously looked at as the best shooter of all time before Stephen Curry came along and that is why he is more comparable to Steph Curry then he is Klay Thompson. Klay Thompson can’t even get a shot off without his teammates helping. He’s a great shooter but he’s not comparable to Ray he’s more comparable to old Ray Allen because that’s what really old round turn this game into, but prime Ray Allen, hell no, that’s the dumbest take I have ever heard. Like I said you clearly have no idea what you were talking about and just saying dumb shit"
"Wake up! You hit your head pretty bad.  Hayward injury? Tatum dunking on LeBron? Being a few minutes away from the NBA Finals? Terry Rozier being better than Eric Bledsoe? Kyrie leaving for Brooklyn? Dude, what are you smoking?   Kyrie’s making his first appearance back in Cleveland since the trade. Trading IT to Cleveland will surely lengthen his career and give him a guaranteed shot at a ring. Grab some popcorn, Celtics at Cavs for opening night is coming up on TNT."
Klay could definitely be the #1 option on a 10 seed team lol. Why do you act like that’s a great achievement? Prime Ray Allen leading his team to a lottery pick is what makes him close to the level of fucking **steph curry?** You’re on crack. Terry Rozier was the #1 option on a 10 seed this year.
"Ideally -   Point guards: 6'3"" or higher  Shooting guards: 6'5"" higher  If either are an inch or so shorter it's not a gamebreaker though. We see a ton of guys closer to 6' in the league but they either need to be running the point or paired with a bigger playmaker (i.e. Colin Sexton or Terry Rozier)"
"Than you. LaMelo has never been asked to be the focal point of his teams offense like Ja. If he ends up being better it will be based on what he proves moving forward, not what he already showed in 30 regular season games where Terry Rozier was the 1A"
"His passing numbers are fine. He made more passes per game than Ja Morant, marcus smart, donovan mitchell, terry rozier, Jamal Murray lmao. He had as many potential assists as Murray, Lonzo, Dragic... He's not some crazy ball hog."
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
Sounds like Terry Rozier with better defense worse offense?
"**Charlotte trades:** Terry Rozier, Kelly Oubre Jr and PJ Washington.   **Brooklyn trades:** Kyrie Irving."
"Fred Van Vleet, Malcolm Brogdon, both Bogdanovics, Lonzo, Scary Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes.  All very high character good players who can be on the floor at the highest levels of the playoffs without being a liability who were available on the market as non-max players.  I'd rather overpay them a bit and trade away a questionable guy with better talent and not max Ben Simmons/D-Lo/Wiggins/John Wall."
LaMelo's got a higher ceiling but I don't know if he's a better player right now. I like the fit of Sexton too next to Brogdon who can be the main ball-handler.  People are sleeping on the fact that Sexton averaged 24/4 last season on great efficiency. He just needs to be paired with a bigger playmaker. Charlotte's already doing that with LaMelo and Terry Rozier lol.
"Yeah this really needs more definition. What statistic are we using to judge the best player, and over what time frame? If it's PPG in the finals, someone like Terry Rozier, Tim Hardaway Jr, etc who you can plausibly get 20ppg from as a sixth man would be a lot more valuable."
"Herro may not be a rising star, but he has the skills to be a very productive role player. He’s a good three-point shooter and has good off-ball movement. Those are two important traits for complimentary players in today’s league. Kuzma is an ok shooter and a decent defender, but he has moments where he goes completely brain-dead and his movement generally looks very clunky in a “Bambi learning to walk” way. So, is he “Kuzma East” in terms of hype? Sure, but Herro is still a good young player with good potential, even if his ceiling is a Malik Beasley/Terry Rozier type."
"Eh. I don’t think anyone is going to bombard someone like Joe Harris or Terry Rozier. Most players can probably still do everyday things without too many people noticing. Probably a couple pictures and autographs here and there. But no crowds. Crowds and chaos happens when you get the stars like Lebron, Steph, KD, and those guys."
"Yeah I’ve got a bunch of quotes for you.  Morris on [being on the 2020 Knicks vs the 2019 Celtics](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-marcus-morris-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-locker-room-20191021-cisa6tvjzrh3blaitezvhymnh4-story.html) and [Kyrie’s leadership](https://www.audacy.com/weei/blogs/nick-friar/morris-backs-kyries-explanation-of-his-last-year-in-boston)    &gt; The teams are different. We don’t have that one guy where it’s like, okay, he’s first. It’s a team thing. No knock on Ky, but obviously he’s a superstar, he’s first. Sometimes his emotions were put in front of the team. I think here, we’re all transparent with each other. We can all go up to each other and be honest with each other. That’s the biggest thing, when you can go out and speak to your brother.  &gt; He just forgot how big of a leader he was. I think he sometimes forgot that. As a leader, outside stuff can affect our team. And I think that did.   Quotes from Rozier [right after the 2019 season](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2836146-celtics-terry-rozier-whatever-kyrie-wants-donethats-what-he-wants-done) (the first 2) and [quotes made the following year](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/terry-rozier-offers-notable-insight-kyrie-irving-brad-stevens-dynamic)  &gt; You just have to adjust to his style. Whatever Kyrie wants done, he's gonna show it, that's what he wants done. And you have to adjust to his style of play and how he goes about every game and every day.  &gt; I think guys was getting it, especially toward the end of the season. Like I said, we had come into the game and it'd be a different game plan than what we kind of expected and went through in practice.  &gt; I feel like it was more of … it kind of wasn’t coach-player. … It was kind of like coach-younger coach. When he came over (to Boston) he won a championship, him being who he is, Kyrie had a lot of stuff that he felt that could change, that he wanted to change about the Celtics. (These are) all on-court things. He felt like he knew a lot of his basketball. It wasn’t just like them going back-and-forth like, ‘We’re going to do it my way. We’re going to do it your way.’ You could just tell, when Kyrie came he was kind of advanced and he had his little input and he wasn’t holding back. He would say what he felt that we could change or we could do. Sometimes it would work out for us, sometimes it wouldn’t.   [Quotes](https://theathletic.com/1410341/2019/11/26/life-after-kyrie-irvings-moods-actions-forged-a-celtics-team-committed-to-doing-it-differently-this-time/?source=user_shared_article) from Smart  &gt; It was huge for us (to see how wrong everything went last year). It was huge because we didn’t want it to happen again. We tried it this way and it didn’t work so the only other option is to go another way, and that’s to not hold stuff in and actually talk. It’s been working for us and we see it. And everybody feels good.  &gt; It’s not that we didn’t know how to act (around him). It’s that we didn’t know how he was going to act. We didn’t know what his moods were and we didn’t know what Kyrie was going through.  &gt; We don’t have to worry about doing stuff on our own. We don’t have to worry about being in our own minds and just think it. We can actually talk. Last year, everybody didn’t know what to say. They didn’t know if they could speak, if they could speak to anybody, or somebody, or a group, and they didn’t know how the reaction would go. It was just different. This year is different. Everybody’s not holding anything in. If we have anything to say, we’re saying it and we’re moving on from it.  All of these quotes were made after the season ended. But Jaylen said [this](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26702069/kyrie-irving-failed-leadership-tells-story-celtics-failed-season?platform=amp) all the way back in January, following Kyrie bashing them in the media. What he warned of seems to have come to pass based on his teammates’ later quotes.  &gt; We've just got to have each other's backs at the end of the day. We can't make comments, we can't point fingers, we just have to continue to empower each other and have each other's backs. If we don't, if we start pointing fingers, everybody's going to go into their own little shells. We've got to continue to play basketball. It starts from the top to the bottom. Not from the bottom to the top, but the top to the bottom."
* Bulls being better off with Zach Lavine being the first option instead of Lauri Markkanen. * Terry Rozier being good in Charlotte  * Hawks beating the Sixers  * Heat being good immediately after the Jimmy Butler trade.
"He fell to round 7 and pick 66 in our draft. Notably shocking players to go before him included Terry Rozier, Jalen Suggs, Robert Williams and Scottie Barnes."
"Boston acquired more all stars, 3, from 2016-18 than any other NBA team and also drafted Tatum and Brown who became All Stars.   The other recent lottery pick they kept over that time was their 2014 pick, Marcus Smart, who’s an all defensive team member,  If you want ant to you can count their 2015 16th pick, Terry Rozier, who they traded for another All Star, Kemba Walker, in 2019.   They included the 2018 8th pick in the Kyrie trade.  I want someone to tell me which picks that they “fell in love with” they should have traded.   No one will, because they can’t.   It’s just a stupid ESPN narrative."
"the chemistry problems totally screwed them. people were going into 18-19 with such high expectations after the ECF without Hayward and Kyrie, including myself. It was a year where the east was more open with LeBron.    Unfortunately the issues with chemistry completely ruined their team and made them a circus all year. Kyrie’s call to LeBron apologizing that he didn’t realize how hard it was to deal with young teammates was an all-time NBA comedy moment. To be fair to Kyrie, it’s pretty clear that Terry Rozier was also causing lots of problems in his contract year, especially with the playing time."
"Rotation depth pieces like Terry Rozier, Marcus, Morris, Aaron Baynes, Marcus Smart, and Daniel Theis?   Our bench was stacked with vets ready to win at one point"
"Gotta disagree on this one, 2 threes and only adequate defense? First off the closest person to making 2 threes on that low of time is Niang on the Jazz with 1.7 3PM @ 16 minutes in the 2020-21 season. If he had adequate defense he still wouldn’t compare to a borderline efficient shot creator like D’lo or Terry Rozier who both gets roughly 30 min a night. Also market wise a shooter who doesn’t need the ball in their hands and can play great defense is very valuable but 2 3PM and 15 minutes is too low of a bar."
"Rozier may like kyrie as a person but couldn't stand playing with him. Terry openly said it wasn't working in that locker room and called out other players as well.  It didn't start with IT leaving because again they went to the ECF and we're minutes away from going to the finals the year they traded him. Why would they have played so wll (with kyrie and Hayward out and kyrie not even attending the ECf on the bench for a nose surgery of some sort) after the IT trade, massively underperformed when kyrie came back and we're embarrassed in round 2, then went back to the ECf as soon as he left.  It was clear kyrie was the issue and you're blind or in denial to think otherwise."
"A locker room dustup between smart and jaylen is absolutely nothing compared to the resentment and lack of trust that started in 2019.  Kyrie didn't play in the 2018 playoffs when they made the ecf, they made it the year before with IT and no Tatum. They got smoked in 2019 where they clearly hated eachother then in the bubble they went to the ECf again when kyrie was out. The one outlier was the year kyrie actually played. Smart has dustups in the locker room all the time, him and jaylen are very close.  Kyrie on the other hand wasn't dustups, they just flat out didn't like the guy.  Once again terry rozier confirmed all of this shit after that season that it just wasn't working with those guys.  Kyrie blew up the chemistry in that locker room.  I've watched almost every single Celtics game the past 15 years, it was beyond obvious that kyrie was not well liked."
"This was post kyrie and it means nothing. Those teams with smart, IT, jaylen, Tatum's first year, etc thy were going to the ECf every year and they clearly trusted eachother. The amount of tension and boiled over frustration was palpable. Terry rozier confirmed this"

"&gt;The Celtics were one win away from the finals without Kyrie, then he had the nerve a season later to say publicly that the young Celtics guys don't know what it takes to be a championship winning team.  I don't think people appreciate how insane that game was. Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart combined to shoot 7-26 in that game and 0-14 from three. If they had even a *normal* bad game (like if Rozier goes 5-14/3-10) instead of 2-14/0-10) they would have beaten LeBron's Cavs and gone to the Finals *without Kyrie.*"
"Poole is substantially far from Terry Rozier offensively. Rozier averaged a highly efficient 20 ppg last year while being a reliable secondary/ tertiary playmaker. Jordan poole is basically a poor mans jamal Crawford atm.  Regardless they have plenty of similarities. They’re both primarily shot creators that like to create for themselves, they do most of their damage  from, have isolation tendencies, handle the ball well, there’s no major differences in their games"
"a 6'5 Terry Rozier is a scary dude, big scary"
I’d say Terry Rozier is a solid comparison
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Speaking of rewriting history, the Celtics that year were down two All-Star level starters, were relying on rookie Tatum, sophomore Brown, and Terry ""0/10"" Rozier, yet somehow were supposedly better than the Cavs. Laughable.  I'll give you Toronto, that was peak Lebronto era. But let's not act like the Pacers (that people weren't even expecting to make it to the playoffs) and the Celtics were better than the Cavs that year. That's just nonsense."
"This is a first take type of take. If you watch the games, you can clearly see the difference between the two. Jrue abused Chris Paul and Devin Booker defensively while Bledsoe was getting cooked by the likes of Terry Rozier and Kyle Lowry (respect to Lowry but he ain't in Chris Paul's category)."
"Definitely a homer take but I believe our small ball lineup of Lamelo, Terry Rozier, Hayward, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington will be our most effective lineup offensively and defensively. I hope we choose to just close most games with that group because they all complement each other so well."
"PG. Terry Rozier SG. Jaylen Brown SF. OG Anunoby PF. Ben Simmons C. Myles Turner  PG. Rozier really excelled with the Hornets as a secondary ball handler. Really strong 3pt shooter and while he has a tendency to gamble on defense, should serve as a strong point of attack defender on opposing PGs.  SG. Jaylen is the secondary scorer here. Has shown to be a really strong 3pt shooter and has really developed his ability to handle the ball, but isn’t necessarily the kind of guy who needs to have the ball in his hands to be successful. Sus off-ball defense but certainly in the upper echelon of on-ball defenders.  SF. Love OG, he can slot into any team and be an asset. Really developing his 3pt shot and like Jaylen, in the upper echelon of wing defenders. Jaylen and OG on the wings is going to lock up opposing scorers.  PF. Simmons is really really the primary ball handler and facilitators but I’m slotting him at PF to make spacing work. In certain matchups he’s going to struggle to defend (thinking of teams with a legit PF like Randle or Domantas) but for the most part, teams are running a big wing at the 4. In those cases, Simmons defensive value will still be realized, and again, this is about putting a team of shooters around him.  C. Was thinking KAT but that would be a sus defense. Myles isn’t QUITE the 3pt shooter as KAT but I think he can anchor the defense better. He may struggle against true centers like Embiid, but again those are rarer occurrences. I’m trading off KAT’s better shooting for Myles’ more balanced game and ability to anchor a team defense."
Terry Rozier  Duncan Robinson  Joe Harris  Ben Simmons  Myles Turner
"Trae Young 5yr / $207 Biased but 100% worth   Michael Porter Jr. 5yr / $172M Hot take: Will never sign another big deal, but not due to basketball reasons Just from a basketball standpoint I think it's an overpay. He was stupid hot last year and won't keep up the %  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 5yr / $172 Probably worth, right now an okayish max, if he improves definitely worth  Jamal Murray 5yr / 170M Not worth, he can give you 50 on some nights but on average is not worth the max imo  De'Aaron Fox 5yr / $163M Will be worth it  Terry Rozier 4yr / $97M Clowned the Hornets for signing him to 3/57, turned out he's good. Will be the better guard out if him and Lamelo for the majority of the contract and worth it  Aaron Gordon 4yr / $92M Imo slight overpay, but still an okay contract If he improves a bit, especially scoring wise he'll live up to it"
"This is a bad look, don't get me wrong, but it still isn't as bad as that music video he released with Terry Rozier."
"That was Scary Terry Rozier, pretty much the same player though lol"
"Want: Fisher, Artest, Chalmers, Battier, Draymond Green, JR Smith, Olynyk  Do not want: Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Terry Rozier, Ezeli, Varejao, Danny Green, Roberson"
"Pat Bev, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Grayson Allen, Nic Batum, Bobby Portis"
"Celtics   2011 - Norris Cole (Jajuan Johnson)   2012 - Fab Melo, John Jenkins (Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo)   2013 - Shabazz Muhammed (Kelly Olynyk)   2014 - Julius Randle, Tyler Ennis (Marcus Smart, James Young)   2015 - Rashad Vaugh, Chris McCullough ( Terry Rozier, RJ Hunter)   This is a very bad team. Makes Ainge look really good if you look at who was drafted immediately after."
"I assume then Paul, Curry, Lowry, Rondo and both Ball Brothers among of many lesser names would be disqualified from that PG title as well?  I mean should we consider Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier as PG's as well from now on due to their defensive responsibilities?"
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
lebron was an absolute terror from 2016-2018. terry rozier/curry/demar and all the other small guards were torched by him over and over.
"This was his quote ""I sacrificed obviously my talent I think the most""  ""You know, it's just being obviously in the shadow of some guys. I feel like the ball was in Kyrie or Gordon's hands most of the time, so I feel like either Terry Rozier was just in the corner or, you know, just on the bench."" I think these quotes show Rozier's biggest issue was being misused because of the level of talent the team had, specifically Kyrie. It is all speculation, but I imagine if he had stayed, Kyrie left, and Kemba never came, that he would have the ball and be much happier. I could honestly see them running a team like they did in their surprise ECF run, with more developed players, while also having players that fit in well with other stars like Hayward and Mook. But hey, it didn't happen so who knows..."
I mean literally everyone was shaking their heads at the Hornets for refusing to trade him that season. They could have signed Terry Rozier even without the s&amp;t that summer because you for sure weren't matching that contract.  It's just incompetence from MJ.

"Terry Rozier, Carmelo Anthony, LaMelo Ball all had worse 2FG seasons recently. As I said it's bad but not catastrophic"
? Like terry rozier
"They made the right call.  Paid Terry Rozier half what Kemba got and he has been twice the player.  Plus, the tank year landed them LaMelo.  Kupchak knew exactly what he was doing that time."

Is Terry Rozier the greatest 3 point shooter of all time?
"I think Smart passes well and can drive to the basket but yeah hes is not really a threat on offense. I think the guy you actually miss is Terry Rozier, he was great and was never afraid to shoot."
"TO's  or Terry Rozier  Please don't let that man shoot when the game is under 2 minutes. I don't care if he's 0-18, dude kills everytime in the clutch"
"also worth a note that we run Terry Rozier at PG (he is not a PG) when LaMelo sits, so there is an absolutely massive difference in playmaking from the PG spots when he goes to the bench."
"Draft assets, Terry Rozier/Gordon Hayward? LaMelo and Bridges look to be the young core going forward and paring them with Turner would be great. Rozier is a bit redundant as a third ball handler and not exactly on their timeline. Hayward too, but even more so."

"I wasn't a fan of the Payne pick at all but if i remember correctly OKC were very keen on Booker so it threw a spanner in the works when he was taken at 13 by the Suns.   Also in hindsight the Cameron Payne pick isn't as bad as it looked at the time, realistically who was drafted after him that you would take other than Normal Powell and Terry Rozier?"
‘’Scary Terry’ ‘ShamGod’ Rozier’’
Terry skip2mylou Rozier
I wouldn’t want to throw down with Scary Terry Rozier
I heard one of them call the 6’10” Jalen McDaniels “Terry Rozier” like three times lmao
"I think the best realistic return for him is like a gordon hayward or terry rozier type player and only because charlotte really needs interior defense  teams like the pistons have no use for ben.  he's not going to be happy there, he's not going to make them into a playoff team.   he's just going to kick around there for a few seasons before he hits free agency  only solid playoff teams really have a use for ben and they aren't going to want to give up the star players that made them into playoff teams in the first place.   or a team that is on the cusp of making the playoffs could maybe use him, but the twolves arent going to give up KAT or Ant for him  I could see the hawks pulling the trigger on it too for a hunter/reddish package IDK if you would consider those guys to be stars.   but capela seems to be coming back into form now anyway so maybe they dont need him"
"The two largest gangs in the west coast IIRC US for majority African-Americans. Bloods wear red and crips wear blue. It’s a major rivalry. There are members in other areas of the country.   Also since some nba players grew up poor and sometimes in the hood near gangs when they showed potential the gangs would protect them, the biggest example is DeMar DeRozan who grew up near crips. Other guys like John Wall have flashed gang signs in games before. Terry Rozier is part of a smaller group called GMB.   The rivalry is so intense crips don’t say B so for example for birthdays they say G-Day, and if you wear rival colors to the wrong neighborhood you could be possibly seen as a member and attacked.   Crips are known for their dance the c-walk, lots of vids on YouTube. Bloods have some famous hand signs like making the word “blood” with their hands and also CK which means crip killa"

I think Terry Rozier is pretty saucy with it
He grew up in compton which has alot of gang violence. Theres also Terry Rozier who‘s straight up affiliated with a gang
"When Rozier is playing his starting role next to LaMelo, he is a near-perfect fit for our starting 5 and I think he was statistically the most clutch player in the league last year.  It goes to shit when he's asked to create for the second unit and make decisions with the ball. It's like if you asked Klay Thompson to facilitate, it's just not part of his skillset.   Terry has had a rocky start to the season, he sprained one ankle in the preseason and the other in his first game back, so he's been understandably rough, but he's looked like himself the last 3 or 4 games and been key to our last couple big wins. I'll take him over Lonzo on this team, but I'd take Devonte' Graham at less than half price leaving enough room for a better center than Plumlee over either Terry or Lonzo"
I like Lonzo but Terry cold and clutched up big for them no doubt  I just feel that Bridges breaking out has made Rozier kind of redundant as now they have 4 go to guys who can each average 20   Lonzo would also really help their defense as its pretty terrible rn. Rozier isn't much of a playmaker either so it would help Hayward and Bridges get easier looks. I do feel Terry will eventually get traded maybe for a young defensive big like Turner
"They also stared at Draymond jumping into Terry Rozier shooting a corner 3 and were like ""Yeah that's legal."" These were like big moments of the game that could've easily hurt us a lot more in the end than they did, not some random shit in the 2nd quarter lol."
POTG is a close call between Terry “Jump Ball” Rozier or that weird AF dance bit that performer did at halftime.
Not salty we didn’t come out with intensity but every single game thread I got to hear about Fitz and his homer calls meanwhile I just listened to Terry Rozier get fellated on live tv
"Damn it Terry Rozier, well done Hornets"
gsw gotta find a better balance of the offense/defense lineups. just not enough creation or outlets on a bunch of the lineups they rolled out to close the game.   hornets always fun to watch i hate terry rozier
"Is Warriors-Hornets the best random cross-conference rivalry in the NBA? Of course, you have the Dell Curry connection. Then there's the LaMelo-Wiseman draft thing. Then you have Kelly Oubre, who left the Warriors for the Hornets on a kinda sour note, and there's also the whole Draymond and Bridges facing each other as two of the best players out of MSU piece. All of this has made for a bunch of really exciting games over the past two seasons, including that one game last season where Draymond got ejected and Terry Rozier hit the insane buzzer beater game winner. Fun stuff."
I ENJOY THE TERRY ROZIER EXPERIENCE MOST TIMES
Terry Rozier is dope
TERRY ROZIER!!! STRONGEST MAN IN THE ROOOOM!
Defense is non-existent and 50% of the sport. His playmaking is also quite ass and he doesn't know how to elevate his teammates.  Plus his playoff performances ever since 2016 have been embarrassing. His entire stint with the Celtics should be scrubbed from history. Terry Rozier proved to be a better option than Kyrie there lmao
He's worth about 15-18 mil a year. Young his get over payed based on potential. Yes he's. A great scorer but he does nothing. Else look at Terry Rozier deal and teryy is an amazing 3pt shooter which basically adds more value. They should be roughly on the same deal.
OH YEAH TERRY ROZIER
Terry Rozier... Solo.
My favorite part of that Marcus smart - Jimmy Butler thing is that Terry Rozier immediately came in. Terry Rozier is pretty much gang affiliated and is probably actually about that. His IG literally starts off gmbrozier. Gmb for get money boyz.
"Except there was a game last season where Collins lost his goddamn mind because Rozier hit two free throws!  It was amazing. “Oh, Terry!  Two beauties!” has been a thing with me and my buddies ever since."
"Terry rozier and capela don’t play for markets that attract max FAs either.   For some reason they seem to be paid perfectly fine. If Turner was worth his deal, he probably would have gotten moved, given that he’s been shopped for 3 straight seasons."
"A center who doesn’t set screens, pass well, post up, or dribble isn’t worth 20 million a year.  I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but he’s certainly not paying as much as a Clint capela or a terry rozier. Anyone who isn’t a major homer would probably agree with me here."
"You talking on the court or off?   Terry Rozier is a Blood. He got a couple tattoos to show.  I’ve heard Brad Beal is a silent tough guy.  Everybody knows Z-Bo  Demar Derozen (from Compton) has *literally* thrown up gang signs after making a play, and once tweeted something like “I wore blue everyday in high school”   John Wall has also thrown up gang signs"
Terry rozier
I've heard rumours of Terry Rozier and John Wall
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

TERRY ROZIER ABSOLUTELY SHOOK AT DWIGHT HOWARDS PERIMETER DEFENSE
Terry rozier and oubre but if I’m picking one it’s definitely rozier cause he’s paid way more
"Hey Cleveland, we'll give you Terry Rozier for Allen straight up. Cool?"
"That Celtics team the next season consisted of Kyrie Irving, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, and Shane Larkin. They were not gonna take another guard"
I could see San Antonio going for Sexton.  Dejounte is 6'4 and has an all-defense accolade to his name. You could have him defend opposing 2-guards and you give Sexton the bigger ball-handler he needs to be paired with. We're already seeing a similar thing with Terry Rozier and LaMelo.

Idk on one side the hornets desperately need defense on the other end we already have enough bad contracts. Terry rozier and mason plumlee for al horford and marcus smart.  edit: Nvm forgot we cant trade terry yet
Now trade Simmons for CJ McCollum or Terry Rozier... imagine
terry rozier been straight ass all season
Terry Rozier had himself an off nite.
I really just want to shit over Borrego because he's so uninspiring and just got comfortably outcoached by Luke Walton but I just can't because Mitch did such a piss poor job building this roster that I don't even think it matters. We drafted four guys this year including trading 5 years of protections for Kai Jones (can't trade our first rounders until 2026 yay!) and none of them are even close to seeing playing time. The bench is a confusing mess and the starters start off every game by putting us in a 12 point hole. We handed Terry Rozier a fat extension that starts next year and he responds by putting up 20% FG shooting nights with shit defense.  It's just so funny that we forced out Cho (previous GM) for going all in on a core that just wasn't that good and then handed the keys to a guy who does the exact same thing but with a team that didn't even make the playoffs. Can't wait to see what happens next
"The problem with Dlo is that there are so many players or variant that players like him/same tier as him but make less. CJ, Brogdon, Sexton, Terry Rozier, Dinwiddie, if you go wings Wiggins etc. Beasley is a good trade piece for anyone below a Simmons caliber player but for a Simmons trade he would be the side part to match salary or make the trade palatable."
"What Marcus Smart said you mean? He also said he is the answer to our offensive problems in the same statement While being one of the worst offensive starters in the league. Smart thinks he is a Hall of Famer but he is a career 36% shooter.  Tatum averages 8 potential assists a game this season, more than players like Jrue Holiday and Terry Rozier who are point guards. Even Brown averages 6 potential assists. They are 24 year old kids, obviously they still need to improve. Lebron didnt win until he was 27 , neither did Jordan or Giannis. Relax with the expectations for a team lead by 24 year olds"
"Rozier gotta be Scary Terry. If that nigga’s just Terry, or Terrance, then y’all fucked"
"He was averaging roughly 20ppg 60 TS% when Hayward was out (LaMelo was out for a chunk of that too) last season the final third of the season and was 62.5 TS% on the season altogether.   I don't believe he's averaging 24/8 all season, as Hayward and Rozier will step up their games from what they're doing right now, but the 60 TS% Miles has right now may be for real.  If I had to guess, Miles, LaMelo, Terry, and Gordon all finish the season between 18-21ppg, and you could sell me on any order"
"I do believe we approached this offseason all wrong. I'd have happily traded Rozier and assets for a good big and retained Monk+Graham. Once we gave away Monk+Graham for nothing, we had absolutely no choice but to keep Rozier, because who else was even going to play guard for us to LaMelo (and you bet Rozier's agent knew that and used it in extension negotiations).  Miles Bridges doesn't even factor into that equation, as he plays the 4, Rozier plays the 2, and we need multiple scorers. It looks like we're going to have 4 guys average high 10s/low 20s per game this year and that's the way to do it when you don't have a top 30 player or a center.  But Terry deserves more than 4 games to conclude that this his extension was a mistake... he's playing through not one but two sprained ankles (one in the preseason, the other in the second game of the regular season) and is clearly not 100%. Last night was easily one of his 10 worst performances in a Hornets jersey, if you're using that as a barometer."
Oubre should start over Terry Rozier
"That third quarter stretch with GPII, Iggy, and Dray on the floor was some of the best defensive ball I’ve seen in a while.  Terry Rozier looked miserable, lol."
Oubre felt some kind of way with the idea of coming off the bench for future HOF Klay Thompson and now is coming of the bench for Terry Rozier ...lol🤣🤣
"Have fun with the formatting:  LAMELO BALL HAS has already seen the future.  Two seconds earlier, he watched [Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers) center [Jarrett Allen](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen) vault over [Mason Plumlee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee) to tomahawk a ferocious slam to give the Cavaliers a nine-point lead three minutes into the second quarter. He saw the Cleveland reserves on the bench rise in exaltation, scream hysterically, flicking their white towels. He heard the Quicken Loans Arena crowd roar its approval.  ADVERTISEMENT  Still, optimism flows from the eyes of Ball. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees it: [Miles Bridges](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066383/miles-bridges) sprinting down the middle of the floor.  Before the Cavs' reserves can even sit down, Ball [hurls the ball 80 feet down the court](https://youtu.be/a1Fjk_s52Sc?t=171) over all five Cavaliers and directly into the hands of Bridges. It's a Sunday afternoon pass on a Friday night, one that's thrown in what seems like a different time and space.  Less than four seconds after Allen picks himself up off the floor following his throwdown, Bridges drops the ball through the opposite hoop with a reverse dunk.  ""He really is a basketball savant,"" says [Charlotte Hornets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets)' teammate and 12-year veteran point guard [Ish Smith](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4305/ish-smith). ""You watch him make these calculated-risk passes, and I'm like, 'How did he even think about throwing it like that?'""  Sheer chutzpah.  A 20-year-old with nothing more than an abbreviated NBA season on his résumé has the audacity to stunt the opponent's momentum with a pass that couldn't possibly have a success rate leaguewide of greater than 10%. Tracking platforms with probability scores -- eat your heart out. For the second consecutive game to start the season, the Hornets are behind early to a middling opponent. And for the second consecutive game, Ball is poised to drag the Hornets by the scruff of their necks back into the contest.

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward [Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and [P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington) could make jumps and add to production provided by [Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from [Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics) a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ￼Through the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3. Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like [Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks), [Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons) and [Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic) all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Some NBA point guards might extend a middle schooler their mercy, especially if the kid is the boss' son. But Ball doesn't temper his competitiveness. As he sizes up his teenage combatant, Ball delivers the trash with a smile.  A crossover to the hole elicits a shimmy from Ball, one returned when his teenage competitor drains a shot. Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity. Something that those who delight in amusement when they hear about the pro baller not pulling punches in the sweetest exhibitions against the most adoring minors can never understand: There's no such thing as turning it off.  Once the afternoon Carolina heat thickened to a stew, LaMelo, his brother LiAngelo -- Gelo to everyone present that afternoon -- and a friend jumped into the Borregos' pool, where they continued hooping with the Borrego kids under rules modified for water.  On the surface, there's nothing odd about the scene -- a confident LaMelo and his brother playing backyard camp counselor. But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
Paying Terry Rozier 25m a year is quite possibly the dumbest thing any any team did this offseason
"That Celtics team had Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, and Terry Rozier **coming off of the bench**. How did we go so wrong…"
"Lol there's this clip from The Bachelor/Bachelorette where the woman took the man to the Celtics training facility back when Jaylen Brown was a rookie, and they shot around with JB and Rozier. The dude literally said ""This guy is one of the best players in the league"". This is when Jaylen was so raw, if he were a steak he'd be mooing.  Edit: https://www.facebook.com/theScore/videos/jaylen-brown-terry-rozier-make-cameo-on-the-bachelorette/840698366286418/"
"I felt like both Danny and Brad had this idea Tatum would grow into a more all around threat. Brad, at the very least was vocal about it (and more recently, Ime as well). I actually think Terry Rozier would have been a good fit with the two, given his potent catch-and-shoot game and relatively decent defense."
"Robert Williams, Terry Rozier?  He hit on his draft picks in FIVE consecutive years.   Since 2019 is when Danny started to lose it and make worse decisions and it's showed, but before then? He was perfectly fine."
They miss Terry Rozier
"flair check…   ok now that’s out of the way, my genuine unbiased opinion is poor leadership. from a distance it just seems like a turbulent, borderline toxic locker room. i dont think Brad is a good leader of men.. i think hes a  good x’s and o’s guy but i think thats about it.  based on my one year experience with Horford he doesnt seem like a vocal leader type he just kinda drifts off and does his own thing.  the Jay’s have all the talent in the world, but the team lacks identity. when you start ripping guys away or letting role players walk in free agency, like Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier, Aaron Baynes etc etc. they might seem like **just** role players, but they had an actual identity when these guys were around. these were gritty, soldier type role players, but theyre also the type of role players that could police a locker room  long story short. fire Brad."
"meh dude formed a roster of  kyrie irving, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, gordon hayward, al horford, terry rozier, and marcus morris  thats a really fucking good team. like.. really good lol.   but got hit with basically worst case scenario and then the celtics were too content with not making moves after it fell apart  while he made mistakes, he did legitimately form an amazing team in 2018. just unfortunate that it didnt work out"
"wait what do you mean ""when we had really good teams"", we were a win away from the finals when we had smart, horford, brown, and tatum in 2017 (Kyrie was hurt)... with Aron Baynes and Terry Rozier as the only others to start every game in that series. yes horford is old now but it's basically the same team lol. obviously I'm not elated that we have played like ass to start the season, and yes there are some obvious issues with our roster, but I think we're getting a classic overcorrection with everyone in this thread saying we should just blow it up"
Terry Rozier is prime Kobe Bryant against the Cavs I swear to god
"Too many players that wanted touches essentially. Also a lot of locker room drama.  Hayward was rehabbing and wasn't ready to be a true contributor again but you're not gonna let Gordon come off the bench.  Rozier and Mook were locker room problems and ball hogs (probably because they wanted a new contract)  Kyrie's Kyrie.  The FO was right to make the Jays the faces of the franchise moving forward, but I think they should've looked to flip Terry and Mook for assets at the deadline."
"Last year, Terry Rozier lead the team in shots per game and points per game.  When Rozier comes back from his ankle injury &amp; returns to from, Miles Bridges’ shots per game (17.7) might decrease as well as his scoring average."
"Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier were both playing for contracts and wanted the ball in their hands, Rozier was leaking locker room drama to the media, and Hayward's injury the previous year meant Tatum and Brown accelerated their growth and deserved to have the ball in their hands just as much as Kyrie, Hayward, and Horford did."
"A few big misses but I wouldn't say terrible. Below average, probably, but Pritchard at #26 and Robert Williams at #27 are great value. I hated Terry Rozier in green but he's become much better with the Hornets than I'd ever thought he would be, and everyone said he was a reach at #16."
Terry rozier lll aswell

"Again, I think it's over blown. Kyrie had a a very good season in 2018-2019. He played every game in the playoffs. He led your team in assists that entire post season. He led your team in points during the bucks games in round two.   Everyone's saying it was Kyrie who made that team choke. But honestly I think it falls on coaching mismanagement. Brad Stevens has not been making adjustments well. Like at all. You guys traded Terry Rozier for kemba. Terry is playing better than kemba. And you let a disgruntled Hayward leave. And now Hayward is back at an almost all Star level. It's like every player that leaves the Celtics ends up being better on the next team. I don't disagree that there is some locker room issues but no way can you blame it on one player alone. The narrative was that it was Kyrie, when in reality maybe it was somewhere in the middle between poor coaching adjustments and other players not named Kyrie causing issues.   Kyrie took a sabbatical. When LeBron did it, in January 2015, it turned the 2015 Cavs season around. I see no difference here. Maybe Kyrie could have been more transparent with his team and coaches. But sometimes you just need a break."
TJ Warren and Terry Rozier... Two other guys who are known for scoring and having good games  Warren isn't a small guard either btw
"Shit is hilarious. As if retaining Al Horford or Kyrie Irving would have been worth it. And Hayward brought the biggest TPE in history, Terry Rozier brought Walker, and Marcus Morris is a bona fide bum who makes 72 million now."
Malik Beasley &amp; Terry Rozier
"Lol the Celtics asset management the last few years have been awful. Here are some names that the Celtics have lost for nothing:  Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris. If that’s not bad asset management, then I don’t know what is."
"No it’s not, only the starters get a fan vote and now the fan vote is only 50% of the overall selection vote. Ja isn’t a starter, and coaches pick the reserves.  And let’s see: Giannis Embiid Beal KD Irving Tatum Jaylen Brown Sabonis Harden Randle Trae  Zach Lavine  Honorable mention: Middleton, Tobias Harris, Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Lowry, Sexton, Siakam, Simmons, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Brogdon  So right now, I’d say bam doesn’t make it"
"Isn’t rozier playing well for them? When we played them, Terry was doing good.."
"It isn't dumb in any facet if your goal is to win a Championship. 2 years for a bonafide superstar who elevates everyone around him instead of a lower tier allstar who won't ever be as good as James Harden. This is a no brainer if you wanna win; I'm tired of homers insulting Harden with thinking Brown (or even worse, Heat fans with Herro) are worth more than Harden  Only someone as stupid as a Celtics fan would covet all his worthless assets in the hope they'll all develop into major Championship contributors on your team instead of taking the necessary risks to win a Championship. You're all over doing damage control for Ainge because you're coping with the fact your philosophy has majorly failed. **Most of these assets in the past 5 years haven't panned out to be Championship core pieces or have left and done even better after leaving Boston, like guys like Terry Rozier.**   Dumping Kemba, and a couple of picks along with Brown as the centerpiece would be more than enough for Harden and Tucker, but you guys scoffed at the idea because why would you trade your 'young core' for a bonafide Top 5 player over the past 6 years? What a stupid idea. You guys are so insistent on fleecing teams and hoarding picks you won't even make basic, common sense moves like a S&amp;T with a player who's gonna leave anyway for a Center who's a perfect fit your team because you held out to try to get even more than what you were offered.  The only contenders are the ones who took real risks to win a Championship. The Lakers did with AD, the Clips did with PG to assure Kawhi's signing and the Nets did with James Harden... and it's going to work out for any one of those teams this year, and it already has for one of them last year.  Remember this, because this is the last time I'm gonna talk about the Celtics situation; Jaylen Brown (along with Tatum) is the one who'll be gone in a few years anyway (through a trade or FA) when he realizes he isn't winning shit with your obsession with hoarding warchests of assets instead of taking the right risks. **The Thunder thought they would had Russ, Harden, KD and Ibaka for longer**, who are muuuuch better than what you have now, and they left before they ever won a Championship. What makes you think it won't happen to you?"
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren’t NBA players I guess"
"bro you had me until you mentioned rozier, this whole sub and their monthers were laughing at CHA for giving them that much,. even one good yer doesn't excuse that dogshit contract that they gave terry"
"The Bugs and Spurs FO should be on the phone to the league this morning about the atrocious officiating in that game last night. Allowing physicality is fine, but letting guys get hacked to death with no whistle can lead to injuries. Terry Rozier mostly either shoots threes or drives the lane, went to the line once on 29 shots last night. There was a goaltending call on the Spurs that was laughably bad, and several sequences of scrums on the ground chasing loose balls that went on WAAAAYYYYY too long."
"The Fact that Terry Rozier, rookie Jayson Tatum and 2nd year Jaylen Brown marched through the playoffs and just about made the NBA finals is crazy"

"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
"That's Terry ""Scary"" ""Locker Room Cancer"" Rozier"
"Honestly I’d still much rather have Kemba than Rozier.   I *think* he’s still a better player in a vacuum, but could be wrong. But I’m convinced hes a much better locker room guy - Rozier had too much of an ego at the end of his Cletics tenure.   I also have to think Kemba has a much, much higher BBIQ and does the small stuff much better. Rozier never struck me as the smartest player.   All that said - I’m happy for terry he’s having such a good season. Prove me wrong."
This move is right out of Kemba's bag... I am loving this version of Terry Rozier
Terry rozier
"You can say whatever you want about Kemba [but regardless of whatever stats Terry puts up he isn’t actually a player conducive to helping a team win](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612766&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1628984,1626179).  Same story every year Hornets are way way better when it’s Graham no Rozier than Rozier no Graham. Still always just going to blatantly limit a team with his approach even if his own stats are good never actually gonna fully embrace just playing off ball and giving full effort on defense"
Look at Terry Rozier too
"""The Living Embodiment of the Divine Masculine"" - Enes Kanter, Terry Rozier and Luke Kennard"
Malik Beasley or Terry Rozier with the ultimate green light to do whatever on a bad team
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He’s a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I’d assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."
"it’s what i’ve been saying ever since he was a 2nd year player in boston, terry rozier is not a fucking point guard   play him at the 2 next to a big point guard and he will thrive"

"Is 40 point games sustainable for him or his 20 ppg average? Honestly, I don't know.  There are two absolute truths about Terry Rozier the player rn; if you put him as a scoring 2 guard who just takes a high volume of catch-and-shoot threes, he's fucking lethal. But as soon as you ask him to run the offense or make plays, your team grinds to a halt.  We're finally using him correctly, and I could definitely see him average ~18 ppg for the year on &gt;40% from 3"
Melo is averaging 5 minutes less while playing alongside Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier. Melo also has better splits. Luka’s WOW moment was the leap he made from rookie year to his second year.
what. terry rozier put 41 points on you
The Terry Rozier contract looks better everyday...
Terry Rozier!
"I don't wanna be that guy but you might as well have kept Terry Rozier if this is worth a post, he basically puts that statline up every other night"
So who wants to trade for terry rozier
"Simmons has issues guarding quick waterbug-type players. Terry Rozier, De'Aaron Fox, Dame. Just really hard to deal with Dame's change of pace.  When it comes to the waning minutes, Doc's best bet is probably swapping Curry for Thybulle like he's been doing recently. But Thybulle can get overly aggressive, and I have a bad feeling Dame is gonna frustrate people with some trips to the line."
"It was the same Boston team Lebron beat but with Kemba Walker instead of Terry Rozier, and no Al Horford."
"Considering a rookie that was coming off the bench is only averaging 5 less PPG than a former all-star that’s only 5-6 years into his career while also averaging more rebounds, assists, and shooting a little better from the field I have to agree.  D’Angelo has disappointed me to the fact that he hasn’t lived up to his true potential.  I honestly believe if the Hornets just give Lamelo the keys to the team and let him go out and win they will do much better.  DeVante Graham, Terry Rozier, and Gordon Hayward are not the franchise players... very good players but LaMelo is clearly the future.  He’s already better than everyone on the team while coming off the bench."

"As a Celtics fan, I’ll be the first to say that Danny can not draft unless he has a top 5, surefire pick. Every year I get hyped and disappointed.  I’m still the proud owner of land on RJ Hunter island.   We should trade the shit out of our picks until we’re bad again lol. The only guys I think of off the top of my head that ainge drafted mid-late first are terry rozier, tony Allen, and rondo (and I’m going back almost 15 years for those two). I’m sure I’m missing some but yeah... Danny is good at trades but he doesn’t draft well when he has to really evaluate players and not just go with a consensus top pick   He did make a big brain move passing on Fultz for Tatum tho, at the time pretty much every had Fultz as a lock for top guy in the draft"
"Joel was not healthy that series, he was injured.   Not having Hayward was a big loss.   Not having Kyrie was addition by subtraction. Your team was significantly better with Terry running the point than Kyrie and Rozier has shown he is a baller since leaving the Celtics.   I block more Celtics users on this site than any other team. Y’all are insufferable."
What about when the Celtics didn't have Kyrie and Hayward?   Does that series not count?  Cause the C's still kicked their ass with Terry fucking Rozier and both your guys healthy
"Shocking as it may be to some, someone like Terry Rozier because by the end of his current contract next year, he will have made $64m in his career and would only be 28. I'd just retire right then and there and live the rest of my life just chilling doing whatever I want. Also he's only 6'1 so my chances of having back, foot, or knee issues are much lower than if I was a big. Last benefit: normal people don't really know what Rozier looks like so I wouldn't be hounded by fans."
"We have to pay him like a starter too.  He's in that Terry Rozier, THJ range.  Good but not great and wanting around $18m for 3-4 yrs.  I'm.not against it but I'd listen to offers now before I sign him this summer or not."
"Lamelo is best served by reliable shooters. Terry rozier and Malik monk are both better shooters than lonzo ball this season. Plus, if we're gonna trade for someone, the position we least need to trade for is a point guard.   Maybe we can sign lonzo in 5-7 years in order to make lamelo happy and keep him in Charlotte if he becomes an MVP caliber player. But for now, let's worry about winning."
&gt;That you need to pair Lamelo with someone vastly bette than Terry Rozier if you want to be a contender.  Damn. You're really out here breaking shit down. Genius
That you need to pair Lamelo with someone vastly bette than Terry Rozier if you want to be a contender. You came in and said Rozier is a good player which is fine. But he doesn’t scare anyone. You came in saying you’re a playoff team which is a bit of an odd point to make seeing as though your under .500. Lamelo could be an all star level player as early as next year. But I don’t think he can be your number one if you wanna win a championship
Nah. MJ/Mitch Kupchak(GM) had the bases loaded and needed a clean up hitter.   &amp;nbsp;  Draft Sleepers &amp;nbsp;  Malik Monk 2017  Miles Bridges 2018 traded draft day  Cody Zeller(Questionable addition) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Expensive Mercenaries(Surprisingly from the Celtics) &amp;nbsp;  Terry Rozier  Gordon Hayward
"Lamelo fans wouldn’t complain about Lamelo being benched behind Steph Curry, at least not the ones who really watch basketball. I would be fine with it . But starting behind Devontae Graham and Terry Rozier? Nah, and now you see why"
Clips need Terry Rozier (please give us something good)
"Forreal. LaMelo might already be better. plus it's not like LaMelo is out here dominating the ball. He's playing next to Gordan Hayward, Terry Rozier, and Devonte Graham."
"Yea, Morris and Rozier were playing for contracts. Morris literally had on court conflicts with Jaylen and Smart. Terry had a lot of not so nice things to say about Hayward after he left. We had too many guys that wanted touches which is the exact opposite of the problem we have now. Kyrie would've had 0 problems running this Iso heavy offense"
Kind of funny that Terry Rozier would have given them what they were looking for in Kemba and is more efficient.
"Underrated: Cody Zeller. The Hornets instantly got better with Biyombo out of the lineup. Our system is ball-movement heavy, and having Biyombo's stone hands in the center was an easy way to kill offense. Zeller can actually execute a drive and kick or catch the ball in the post, that's huge for our offense. He's also better on defense than Biz, Biz is too immobile to hang with all but the slowest of Cs. Cody can actually move around.   Overrated: Terry Rozier. People look at Terry's stats (19/4/3) and assume he's playing well. But those averages are emblematic of the law of averages. Terry will go for 45 one night on 11/18 shooting, then 9 points on 4/18 the next night. He's incredibly streaky, but doesn't have an off switch for when he's playing poorly. He can kill our offense by chucking inopportune shots, but he has gotten much better at this. His defense is also heinous; he's undersized at 6'2"", which doesn't help him, but he can be guilty of ball watching or zoning out; some nights he'll clearly be more focused on defense than others. He's a good player and been solid for us, but he's more of a LouWill bench adrenaline shot than a true starting level SG."
"Whenever I watch parts of a Hornets broadcast the one dude hypes me up so much.   Like that Terry Rozier dunk on KD recently, I keep going back to it fir the commentary."
The Celtics could really use Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward instead of Kemba right now.
Terry Rozier? Seems like the only player with a huge expiring contract unless the Hornets are looking to move on from Heyward.
"No one said he is a bad teammate, but he did thrown the young celtics under the bus and saying that they dont have what it takes to win a chip. Brown called him out and then he apologized. In the bucks series, he did kinda sabotage the team by trying to guard Giannis and taking bad shots and giving up on the series. Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward had some conflict with Kyrie. He also hindered the growth and development of players like Tatum and Brown."
"Well the Hornets' best scorers may have been Terry Rozier, LaMelo Ball, and Devonte' Graham, who are all known as PGs mostly. So if you take out 1 PG and add a SG, your balance may be a little better.  (Rozier and Ball can basically be SGs, but Graham is pretty small.)"
"[MJ is a meddling owner.](https://arizonasports.com/story/2044476/michael-jordan-terry-rozier-sign-hornets-over-suns/)  Mark Cuban too.   They may not be as dumb as Dolan, but they are semi-GM."
"You think half these guys have a shot at that?   Most of these guys are dumb as shit outside of basketball. There's smart guys like Jaylen Brown, CJ, Brogdan, Cam Johnson, Gasol bros and so on.  There's more guys with the same brain cells as Terry Rozier in the league though who can barely read a book."
"Yes. His name is Terry Rozier.  Lonzo isn't going to replace that scoring or dog mentality, and Terry has also been improving steadily ever since he first got to Charlotte. Hes still young as well, and has been significantly more durable than Lonzo as well.  Lets say we're afraid of him wanting a big salary: well, give him this year to prove it. If he balls out, excellent, we probably played well and we'll have his Bird Rights anyways. If he doesnt, also excellent, because now we can get him at a discount, or even trade him then.   To me, it makes more sense to try to trade Terry at the deadline anyways *if* you were to move him  We have LaMelo, a legit PG. You say we need a secondary ball handler? Terry does that. We need stalwart defense? Terry does that. We need someone who can shoot 3s? Terry does that.   The only thing Lonzo does better than Terry, IMO, is rack up assists. And while that's all well and good, we already had one of the slower and more vapid offenses in the league, and losing a scorer like Terry isn't going to help that."
"They probably offering them for like Terry Rozier and a Devonte Graham S&amp;T to us. No will do, LeGM"
"I've got this idea in my head that they could get Terry Rozier and Derrick White in a 3 teamer, that's about it though"
"So I just became a fan recently, about 5 years now. 2016-17 season was the first year I watched but 17-18 was the first year I watched games consistently. It wasn't actually a specific player (although I do love Marcus Smart) it was that whole team, the heart and hustle they showed. Down 15? 20? 25? not a problem. The grit that they all showed... That is bleeding green. To name one guy, it was probably scary Terry Rozier that playoff run."
Or he might get a Terry Rozier style offer.
"not if the warriors wanna win games lol   they’d start looney and have terry off the bench, and that closing lineup with dray at the 5 and one of poole or rozier would be good on both ends of the floor   if the warriors want to win games in 2022 starting wiseman is a disaster"
Good lord this is terrible  Is Hayward really even an upgrade over Wiggins at this point?  So we’re basically sending Wiseman and 2 lottery picks for…Terry Rozier?
"That makes sense.   I definitely follow fun teams like Denver, Atlanta and Portland.  My family has had Celts tickets for 40 years so I have a strong rooting interest in the Celtics but I do end up rooting for guys I liked on their new teams.   Love watching Terry Rozier succeed in Charlotte, for example."
Biggest need is obviously center. They actually have a fair bit of cap space and Holmes is the best center on the FA market. I’m not sure what they end up doing about Devonte Graham given that they already have Ball and Rozier but Terry is on an expiring
Kemba Walker for Terry Rozier?  Victor Oladipo for Caris LeVert?  Kyle Korver for Copy Machine?  PG13 for SGA?
"I’ll throw Lavines name in there. I don’t think he needs to be hailed as the second coming of Jesus, but I’ve seen people in recent weeks say they’d prefer Terry Rozier, Fred Van Vleet, etc."
underrated: terry rozier
I disagree with lamelo being better than rozier its pretty clear terry rozier the best
Did you just quote a statline of 22 games while the best player on the team was Terry Rozier?
He got punked by Terry Rozier lol Terry got some ocean front high rises for free in Drew Bledsoe’s head
"Horford, rookie Tatum, sophomore Brown, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris"
