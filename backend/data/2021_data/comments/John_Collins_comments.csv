"I know it's unlikely but if he re-signs with y'all I really hope you guys can turn it around and become legit contenders somehow. Maybe sign John Collins, trade for Beal, etc."
"Yeah by Jordan Clarkson, we mean John Collins right"
"Honestly I dont think Capela's defense has been that great. He's good, but just having a competent center in general changes a team. Conversely I thought last year Trae and John Collins defensive failures were overstated. I mean Trae is still bad but people  claimed it was impossible to have an average defense with him on the roster and John Collins was playing out of position. Didnt stop the hottakes from flying"
"Jarrett Allen, Derrick rose, buddy hield, JJJ, and D-Lo over John Collins?"
"I don‚Äôt take it as a slight I just thought it was funny seeing the scenario with your flair attached, no hate or disrespect intended. I know what it‚Äôs like to have people covet your players and it gets annoying so I try not to do that too much.   My ideal scenario next year is all 4 of LA, Patty, Rudy, and Demar find good homes to end their careers and we ride into next year with our current core of young players + whoever we draft + John Collins. I will be shocked if they make a trade this year as much as I want it to happen.   I feel really good about our future if that happens. Keldon is capable of matching up with any 4 in the league, Derrick and Dejounte are a great complement, Lonnie is a question mark, and Vassell has the ability to guard 1-3 and sometimes 4. Jakob is a really solid defensive presence and would work next to Collins as a starter, and depending on the match up, we can do some really interesting small ball action with Collins at the 5. I try to watch every hawks game and that man is underrated for his IQ on both sides of the ball. Really impressive to watch.  Dejounte/Derrick/Keldon/Collins/Jakob opening night line up   Dejounte/Derrick/Vassell/Keldon/Collins death line up. Switch everything. Run the floor like a bat out of hell."
"If he leaves I'd like him to go to y'all. Lmao, why are y'all taking this as a slight?   So you'd rather lose LMA for nothing, and then do Murray-White-DD/Keldon-John Colling-Poeltl for next year?   Or are you trying to ditch DD too? The whole point of this thread is that the direction forward is confusing. You have 4 young wings who are all trying to improve / hit their ceilings and they're likely not going to all be happy if they have to compete for 20-25 mpg with each other [See: uh, John Collins].  I suppose Keldon can play the 4, but then you still have Lonnie, White, and Vassell, and that's if y'all let DD leave."

"John Collins dumbass really looking at the refs like ""what I do?"" Lmao"
John Collins made the fatal mistake of posting up LeBron
"John collins is a perfect example of ""grass is greener on the other side"". ""stuck with trae""? Trae is who makes him what he is! The attention he draws and the playmaking he provides is a great help to Collins.  1) We rag on Lauri's lack of self creation -&gt; John Collins is FULLY playmaking dependent. 2 point FG assisted rate:  Lauri- this year (61%) -&gt; second highest of career, career (53%) Collins- this year (65%) -&gt; lowest  by far of career, career (73%)  2) Lauri is by far the better shooter compared to Collins. His 3 point rate is nearly 2x that of collins. That's a more valuable trait to have than ""dunks""  3) Lauri's FT rate is again higher than Collins even though Collins is a lot more of a rim runner/traditional big. (Lauri is also the better FT shooter) That's a more valuable trait  4) We rag on Lauri's rebounding but Collins' isn't that much better. They are similar defensive rebounders (% wise) Collins is a better offensive rebounder but I think that's to be a given considering how close he plays to the basket. His average distance of play is 8 ft (this year is the highest at 11 ft). Lauri on the other hand plays at the minimum of 15 ft (almost double!).   5) Lauri is more efficient while creating more and taking a LOT more jumpers  6) Defense wise both are poor. Rim protection is probably a wash. I think Lauri is the better perimeter defender. IMO Collins is both mental + physical deficiency on defense. Lauri it's mostly physical.  I'd rather have the more shot creating/sharpshooting big with potential to be okay on defense. But I can see how a more athletic specimen would be more enticing."
"""Of course if there‚Äôs anything out there publicly, I always go directly to [that person],‚Äù Young relayed to Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúAs for the John [Collins] incident, me and him talked about it as soon as it got out the next day and we were both confused.

"well when you start talking about a Wake Forest legend from the Virgin Islands that would go on become one of the greatest bigs of all time, winning championship after championship over a long career with the same team, it's easy to wonder whether you're talking about Tim Duncan or John Collins  oh wait is it still 2021"
San Antonio would actually be awesome for John Collins
"John Collins and I don't think it's that close. Stats aside, watch the games. Collins looks better out there."
John Collins easily. He plays defense. But if I picked one for my team it would be Lauri because he isn‚Äôt getting a max.
What if I replace John Collins with Julius Randle
"I understand the hesitation for sure.  I just think he is the kind of name who would be reasonably acquired with the TPE.  While it's a huge TPE, you gotta either take bad money or give up extra assets for a + player.  All the articles I've seen about using it wants a bunch of valuable players, without really acknowledging that the other team wouldn't give that play to a TPE lol  Edit: like saying John Collins into it.  Like even if they couldn't agree on an extension this off-season, you don't give a 20/10 forward with 40% 3p% making like 5m into someone's trade exception.  Even for a 1st or something lol.  You definitely let a player of that level his RFA and decide from there, if there isn't an equally talented player on the table."
John Collins?
Thanks. Trae Young and John Collins got that plus 40 off the Bulls in game one.

"Gary Harris although I think he becomes a free agent next season, John Collins, Lowry, Lopez isn‚Äôt a bad wing defender, ntilikina, and I‚Äôm sure I can find a few more good defensive players on the market if I did some research. Oubre is not a unicorn here."

I still see spurs fans trying to trade him for John Collins lol
We‚Äôre so deep. We just need another star big to replace lamarcus and we‚Äôll be great. Maybe John Collins? Idk
I post in the hawks sub so people can hopefully understand better.  You notice how the people are realizing what John is this year?  Guess who said that for the longest.  I even had one hawks fan say that Collins is a tweener the other day.  Guess where that came from.  I like talking atlanta sports because they are my teams.  Did you see the people in there yesterday that thought you couldn‚Äôt play OO to develop him and try to win?   It goes on and on.
"I think we can re-sign DeMar on a mutually beneficial deal, then chase someone like John Collins (power forward out of Wake Forest? sounds familiar) to resolve our big man issue."

"John Collins, Bogdan, first round pick"
"John Collins and Trae argued like normal teammates in every sport ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, they‚Äôre fine now. And take trae off that team they gone be losing a lot more games lol. You say the generic trae hate speech"
"As it stands both him and John Collins are having down years right now. The Hawks are still on the better team but both them and the Bulls are in the play-in right now.  As I mentioned, I have not taken the fan-vote into account and that may throw everything out the window. But statistically I gotta give it to LaVine."
"The Hawks have the most assets.  I wonder if Bogdan, John Collins, Okongwu and 2 firsts would do it.  But they have plenty of other stuff to offer; Huerter, Reddish, Tony Snell as salary filler."
"The real problem with the ""Is he worth so-and-so many dollars?"" has a great inherent problem. NBA max contracts are cost controlled. So every single team in the NBA can have 2 (maybe 3) max contract players. And upper tier players get these max contracts during free agency. So at any given time there are around 45-50 max contracts out there. And many free agent players will get those available slots. Mike Conley was the highest paid player in the NBA 3 years ago. Why? He wasn't the best player but he was due for a new contract and got the max. As long as the salaray cap goes up the newer max contracts will rise too. So in 2 years you might see Jamal Murray getting a 250m contract or John Collins getting one. They are not the top talent in the league but if you're among the top 50 or considered by one GM to be in top 50 you'll get these contracts.  If there was no cost control then Kawhi, LeBron, Steph etc would get around 60 and Gobert might get 15. But not in this salary structure.  Also Gobert definitely deserves that. He is a top 30 player in my book."
John Collins Kevin huerter okongwu and this seasons 1st round pick
I was *begging* to move up for John Collins. (Though Derrick White turned out pretty great)  Then the next year for SGA.   This year it was Haliburton (Though Vassell looks good)
John Collins and an unprotected first for Ayton pls
You really think they would put John Collins over Tobi? lol
And the fact that of the top five guys last year minutes wise John Collins has the most games played before the season started.  Trae had the second longest tenure in the league.
"Well, probably.  But it's really a balance of if the fanbase and if Dame himself would tolerate trading CJ away.  That's the most immediately good player where there's maybe too much overlap between what he's good at and what Dame is good at (and what they're each bad at), and where you could get a really good return for trading him.  Also, they have young, talented replacements on the roster for his minutes (GTJ, Simons), and you can definitely make the argument they'd be better off getting an elite piece a forward slot, rather than double-down on their two best players being guards.  Maybe CJ for John Collins + Picks, or maybe they could have somehow landed Hayward.   But that's really a choice they would have needed to make before last offseason, because now they'd be forced to sell low on CJ due to the injury, plus the other pieces they picked up fill in around a core of Dame+CJ+Nurk, so what would you do with DJJ, RoCo, Melo, Hood, etc.?  And I guess I typed nice words, but let's hold back on any praise of my intelligence (or maybe you were being sarcastic?  I which case, accurate).  I just live in Seattle these days and so Portland is the closest team I can care about and be a fan of (and maybe someday attend a game in person again)."
"John Collins, Tony Snell, Cam reddish and 2 firsts"
John Collins in Houston!
The Hawks are +15.4 points per 100 possessions (97th percentile) when John Collins and Clint Capela are both on the floor.
There is 0 chance John Collins gets traded this year. The Hawks didn't offer a deal specifically because they want to see how he integrates in this team.
John Collins? He wants a big payday and is being pushed aside by Capela. Would obviously cost more in trade than just Graham.
John Collins is a basketball player.
"&gt;	as opposed to a team with valanciunas   Lol. Do you hear yourself right now? I feel like I‚Äôm talking to JV‚Äôs burner account.  &gt;	and a bunch of really good young promising players  Are you saying that John Collins, Huerter, Hunter and Reddish aren‚Äôt good players?"
Man Capela is the real deal. Looks like we‚Äôve found the center to pair with Trae Young. Guess John Collins will have to sign somewhere else in the postseason huh??? Maybe San Antonio??? Please???!
"Wood is literally John Collins, they‚Äôd fit fine"
"okc might wanna trade one of their bazillion picks for john collins, rookies need someone to attract gravity and shai can't be on the floor all the time"
"Lol if you think John gets treated like a role player you either dont watch the Hawks or you do and just don‚Äôt understand the sport.  Id love to hear how you think Collins who is a terrible shot creator, ball handler and playmaker for himself we‚Äôll go to 25 points when he‚Äôs not in plays with one of the best offensive players in the league and doesn‚Äôt get easy rolls to the basket and slips out to the perimeter because Trae gets so much attention."
"Zion, Lebron, Giannis, John Collins, and I'll throw Kyrie in there but not sure if the stats back it up. He's just so incredible at finishing off the glass at so many different angles"
Im pretty sure he‚Äôs not. The dudes had freakish athleticism since he was a rookie and even if he gets old  and his quickness deteriorates. He‚Äôll still have enough power at 6‚Äô8‚Äù to be able to dunk. Im sure the league does mandatory drug test for example john collins and deandre ayton
"NBA has the good old ""common sense"" testing procedure. All the PED tests are pre-scheduled(technically u can be randomly tested up to 4 times besides the scheduled ones, but this rarely happens), so they pretty much just expect you to cycle off before the test and continue after. Because of this, players RARELY get caught for PEDs and it's usually young guys who prob just got lazy about cycling off. The last players i remember getting caught were dendre ayton and john collins, and i think both were like 21 at the time or something."
"John Collins is a plus defender this year, hasn‚Äôt been a negative defender since his second season."
John Collins is gonna get a bag people saw he was capable of averaging 22-10 even if he isn‚Äôt putting up the same stats this year
Of course lol i was just adding up to the fact that no 30ppg guys are available for trade right now. Unless OP is thinking Vucevic or John Collins lol
John Collins is getting a Max. The question is whether or not the ATL pay him the max or someone else.
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"

"For the love of God this is how politics work. Go a little deeper before parakeeting an article. They addressed it verbally already and you can also see its nothing from the way they communicate. Trae didn't pout for 3 games. People who don't watch the Hawks have some skewed reality. He took a shot to the head from Jordan right at that time and people were saying the concussion thing was a hoax, which maybe it wasn't as bad or was as bad. I don't know. The Collins thing comes out a day later and people chose that. Pouting isn't missing shots and trying but turning the ball over. He just was in a slump. He has been trying to cover it up by shooting less. A less than 10 fg% will do that to a guy. People then say he is protesting when he wants to win. What happened last night? He was still slumping in the first half so he wasn't shooting nearly as much. As soon as that ball went in a few times and the confidence was back he was old Trae again and Collins was loving every damn minute of it. Its not even an assumption, you could see it on camera. Also, after that game they interviewed Capela and he said they have been telling him not to get down and knew he could have a game like he did in that 2nd half and that they were trying to help him maintain confidence. Bad play doesn't mean pouting or drama. Every time he made a shot the whole damn team had his back.   I hate this drama machine man. It should have stopped in the original quote when John said it wasn't a big deal. Articles are just words, which is easily taken out of context because you can't see tone or emotion."
It really is. This Reddit thinks Collins saying something is a feud when the guys love eachother. They don't watch the games and it's Reddit. Even in the report they quoted him as showing love after the criticism. John and Trae seem to be super closer than anyone on the team and recently Capela looks close to John. They seem to be getting this odd synergy. We saw the clips of those 3 after the game yesterday. You see it every game.   Don't worry about a guy who doesn't actually watch or care about your team or its dynamics and development. It will just aggravate you. Somrtimes these guys upvote things that are blatantly wrong too.
Capela and Sexton own the night. Trae also came outta nowhere with this one. John Collins with the block that made my boy Bam even shed a tear. LOVE TO SEE IT

"They are one competent PF/C from being a second-round playoff team next season.  With all the cap space they have, I'm curious as to whether they make a run at John Collins.  Would fit the more uptempo style and give them an interior scoring kick they need, even if he's not an ideal defender."

"I definitely think this would be more accurate not just going off of birthplace. Living in Utah, John Collins was born on a military base and barely spent any time here. I think the best active player from here (spent most of their childhood and teenage years) is Frank Jackson. I think overall it would be more accurate if it was done that way other than just birthplace"
Trade Love and Drummond. Get a top 10 pick. Throw money at John Collins in offseason since you‚Äôll have space for the super max he wants but Hawks can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt give him.
John Collins scared him
"When people talk about the Hawks on this subreddit they always act like Collins can play center (he can't play defense) and that Capela is expendable.  I know its a clich√© saying on this sub but I really don't think people have been watching the games. If Atlanta gets back to .500 tomorrow and back into the playoff race Trae and John will have had very little to do with it. The work horses of the team have been Hunter and Capela. Those 2 are the only guys keeping the teams energy up and in games. Capela has been decent offensively, a menace defensively, and is 3rd in the league in rebounding. There have been numerous plays where Capela tips the ball and fights off 4 opposing players to get an extra possession or a put back. The Hawks rank near the top of the NBA in second chance points solely because of him.   If you take Capela off of that team not only do they lose, they have little to no defense and they have no real center that is capable of playing big minutes. Also, there is no power forward unless you want to go really small.  Capela has also been getting better every game and his fitness is coming back. He looks too big for the 1 through 4 to handle and too quick for 5s. He and Hunter are the two most valuable pieces right now. Collins is talented but man he loves to dissappear after hot starts, he doesn't give you a full game. Capela definitely does that. Also as of late Collins and Capela have been getting a synergy with eachother while playing together, which a lot of people thought wasn't feasible.   If Capela isn't doing all the dirty work then that team is full of shooters and has no physicality to it. I don't mean to overstate how important he is to that team, but its just mind boggling from my perspective that people see him as expendable when he is arguably playing the best ball on that team right now. Offensively he is a free oop machine and now he actually can create a little offense on his own. Defensively he single handedly holds the paint, and his rebounding is almost the best in the NBA. All of the things he does is literally irreplaceable for the Hawks and plugs up a lot of their glaring weaknesses. Collins isn't even contradictory to Capela. He likes the 3 ball and midrange games and takes people off the dribble or posts up pretty far out to use his quickness to  get inside or take a jumper. Capela is literally the opposite and operates solely in the paint and doesn't mind if he gets the ball or not. You can leave him pointless and he will sit there doing all the little stuff noone bothers trying to do and will win you the game that way."
"it's really tough, you just have to hope the Blazers can hang tough while CJ &amp; Nurk are out.  It's a great opportunity for Gary Trent Jr. to step up, and I like his pairing with Dame in the starting line-up.  Hopefully Rodney Hood can keep his comeback going too and take on a larger role to chip in.     My thinking is that more than changing the coach after the year, the organization needs to take a really long look at Neil Olshey.  He's been pretty high variance and unfortunately it's been more down than up lately.  The Simons &amp; Collins picks in particular are looking really poor right now, Simons just flat out isn't very good and Collins has had problems staying on the floor and got taken over some really, really good NBA players that year (Mitchell, Bam, John Collins, OG).  In both cases the Blazers went for project/upside prospects when they already had a franchise superstar and a couple star players in CJ &amp; Nurk, perhaps going for more ""sure thing"" players or making different moves at the time to maximize the core they had would've been better.  Hindsight is 20/20 of course, but there were signs in the moment that the process was questionable (Simons in particular was a strange, strange pick).   I actually like Stotts and I think he's done pretty well with the roster he has.  Are there better NBA coaches? Sure, but the players still play hard for him and he's not doing things that are tanking the on-court results.  It's hard to coach competent defense with a rotation that includes Melo, Kanter, Dame &amp; CJ (both of them try on defense but size limits their impact).  Even the players the Blazers have that are ""good"" defenders have limitations and/or aren't elite performers.  DJJ is active on defense but still pretty untested.  RoCo is solid but not an All-NBA level stopper.  Gary Trent Jr. tries hard but is small.  Nurk is great on the glass &amp; takes up space near the rim but he's not the kind of big that switches onto the perimeter &amp; is match-up dependent.   Creating a contender in a small market is incredibly tough, even when you strike oil on a franchise player that wants to be there you have to nail every single peripheral move to get over the top.  At least Dame plays in a city that loves &amp; respects him and turns out for him every night, he certainly shows up for us and it's pretty awesome to watch."
"LMFAOOO you idiots won't even have John Collins next year. Lol at least the Spurs will always be in good hands. Uhh, what was your record again? Lol."
"My personal hot take is the Raptors should send Lowry for assets and do a ""soft rebuild"", sort of what the Celtics did in 2013-14 and 2014-15.

JOHN COLLINS
Wack.  Trae has basically had below replacement level players on his team until this season.  It's not apples to apples when Trae hasn't had CJ or MVP Westbrook.  John Collins doesn't count.
That's not a nice way to talk about Zach and John Collins astronaut father
"&gt; John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.    We won't be able to S&amp;T for John Collins because we're going to be way too close to the apron to execute the deal. Right now we have something like $10 million under the projected apron with 11 guys on the roster.    As far as the rest of those guys go, I'm not sure any of those guys put us over the top either, so going by that standard those trades don't really do much for us. Not to mention why would someone like Randle be available?   &gt; the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.   I mean the Celtics would have Smart, Barnes, Timelord, Pritchard, whoever was left between Romeo/Langford, and after the draft probably our full cadre of picks. That's not all that far off what the basis was to put together a similar deal to what the Nets put together for Harden.    It's all dependent on what the Kings asking price is for Barnes, but barring something completely unreasonable he could very easily be a nice incremental upgrade for the team."
"After this season, the Celtics won't be hard-capped anymore so they can use the full amount of the TPE, so it does grant them a bit more flexibility.  Players I'd target in the summer that might not be available now and that I'd like to have instead of Barnes:  John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.  Using the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.  Also Harden really only wanted to go to Brooklyn so the bidding was limited, there's no guarantee that the next star player that demands a trade says ""Boston or bust"" (hasn't happened yet so seems unlikely.   The Kings are going to ask for multiple picks for Barnes, they want to compete this year and it's a ""he's worth more to us than he is to you"" scenario."
"I'm a big Miami fan but I don't see Herro ever becoming a 1st option franchise cornerstone type of guy.  That being said, there are plenty of reasons why the Heat wouldn't give him up for Vucevic.  The main one being including him for the next disgruntled star that becomes available (seems to be multiple a year now).  Vucevic would be great, but the dude is 30 and has only played in 10 playoff games, so maybe Riley is a bit turned off on that.  Vuc's contract is front-loaded, which makes him more attractive, but Herro is much cheaper for that same duration.  So if anyone else might be coming (i.e. John Collins), might as well not trade *anyone* and save the cap space."
"Big list, but...  &amp;#x200B;  **Victor Oladipo**  HOU  **PJ Tucker**  HOU  **Eric Gordon**  CHA  **Richaun Holmes**  SAS  **Nemanja Bjelica**  SAC  **George Hill**  LAC, if they have enough cap space  **Al Horford**  Stays or is released.  Bad contract  **JJ Redick**  Whoever needs shooting.  MKE or LAL probibly, maybe back to Philly  **Nikola Vucevic**  Hornets?  Maybe Celtics  **Evan Fournier**  Stays in ORL  **Terrence Ross**  Warriors or Hornets  **John Collins**  Depends.  Likely ether traded to WSH for Beal or SAS for DeRozan, maybe HOU for Olidipo  **Larry Nance**  CLE  **Kyle Lowry**  Clippers is a nice fit, but no cap space.  If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
"I‚Äôll take control of Kawhi during the last possession against the Sixers, make my move early, and turn the ball over to Simmons with enough time for him to run down the floor for a game winning dunk. We might still lose to Milwaukee or the Warriors (new timeline, maybe KD doesn‚Äôt get injured), but this would bring me peace.  Second choice: John Collins during the possession where Embiid dunked the life out of him last year. Need to feel that"
"in terms of pure value, yeah maybe, I still wouldn't do that if I were the Heat as I would rather go for John Collins instead"
shoutout to John Collins
"He's shown a lot more creativity than a lot of previous dunkers for the past decade combined.  Creative that works too, not just John Collins wrecking that plane creative but actually fun to watch creativity"
Trae young and John Collins about to be called up since they're just chilling at home in Atlanta
capela and john collins lfg
Him shooting them at an above average efficiency doesn‚Äôt mean the team doesn‚Äôt want him shooting them often. John Collins made apparently made a comment about the way Young runs the offense and that‚Äôs when he had the 7 point game right after. And I did watch that game. He was playing like he was Harden on the Rockets on his last days there. How are you going to tell me that wasn‚Äôt selfish play on his part?   No how I feel correlates to reality. He‚Äôs played 34 games and the hawks are 16-20 on the season. He has monster games on the regular and they regularly don‚Äôt learn to wins or wins frequently enough.   See this is the problem with this sub. I make a comment on how someone is overrated and that players fan base comes out and attacks full force. You saying I only watch highlight mixtapes shows you‚Äôre completely biased and have no intention in hearing my  reasoning. I‚Äôve watch about 60% of his games this year and I watch a ton of him last year because I‚Äôve had him on my fantasy team since his rookie year.   I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again. Trae Young is overrated.
&gt;He has the ball in his hands a lot and he takes early deep 3‚Äôs often enough to be an issue.  Because we need him to have the ball in his hands. Look at his on/off-numbers. The Hawks have no other legitimate ball handler on the roster. The early deep 3s are perfectly fine as he's shooting them at above league average efficiency from 3.  &gt;John Collins even called him out for the way he runs the offense and the next game he had 7 points on 9 FGA.   He had 7 points on FGA because he didn't care. He was fed up at this point and frustrated with Lloyd Pierce and the situation. If you watched the game everyone pointed out how lackluster he looked and how he didn't look like himself.  &gt;I just feel like his stats and play style haven‚Äôt lead to wins even though they have a solid team.  You feel like it but it simply isn't the case. Just watch the correlation of Trae Young having good games to wins in comparison to Trae Young taking a backseat approach and others putting up big numbers to wins.  I.e. John Collins having big games usually has no influence on the outcome in comparison.  Your evaluation sounds much more like someone who watches highlights and quick checks stats. Trae Young is integral for the Hawks success. The whole team is set up around his skillset and when everyone's actually healthy it becomes obvious.
"I do watch him, I have him in one of my fantasy teams and I like to see how my top players do so I watch them play as much as I can. We know that he‚Äôs important for the hawks to succeed but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he‚Äôs selfish. He has the ball in his hands a lot and he takes early deep 3‚Äôs often enough to be an issue. John Collins even called him out for the way he runs the offense and the next game he had 7 points on 9 FGA.   I just feel like his stats and play style haven‚Äôt lead to wins even though they have a solid team. He has the talent now he just needs to figure out how to win. That‚Äôs why I feel like he‚Äôs overrated."
"I dunno if it ""changes the entire NBA Championship landscape,"" but Ayton for John Collins is a trade that I just think should happen. I don't know exactly what side pieces would need to be included to make it line up, but the Suns would get better this year to attack their window with CP3, and the Hawks would get to kick the can a bit with their development, and have more time to figure out exactly what they have in their young players, while still getting back a big man with elite upside."
"Jarrett Allen has this same mindset and I loved him for it. Had some amazing blocks (Lebron James, Blake Griffin, Giannis) and has been postered plenty of times (John Collins, Marquese Chriss)."
John Collins was his pen pal
John Collins for John Collins who wins
"John Collins should be picks from OKC, pair him with SGA"
John Collins
If the Suns wanted to get on the John Collins rollercoaster and the Hawks wanted to get on it Mikal Bridges doesn't have the upside but he's healthy and probably defends and fits with Young and Capela better.
John Collins welcome to the Twin Cities!
That‚Äôs a more feasible offer for John Collins but I‚Äôm skeptical regardless of whatever they say publicly that ownership would foot the kind of tax bill a JC Max would require for Boston
Minnesota should make an offer for JOhn Collins   Shams last month said asking price was a lower level lottery pick  Time for my annual patty mills to the sixers fake trades that‚Äôll never happen
"This is dumb the reason why is we didn‚Äôt want princes contract so instead we traded a rental of Allen to dump princes contract for KPJ, an unprotected first and the cap space to sign John Collins in the offseason.   We‚Äôre gonna run KPJ Nwaba Tate Collins Wood"

John Collins is the definition of an enigma.
"Depends on how good DeAndre gets. Collins is going to be offered the max from some teams (or at least that's what seems likely) and that will be hard to match. The Hawks are going to need to give Trae a huge contract when the time comes, and that'll make it very difficult to give DeAndre a large contract if we give Trae and John max level money. It's a bit of a gamble of course, but I think if DeAndre continues to improve the way he has been he can ultimately be a more valuable player than John. But again, this is based off of play from just the start of this season before injury. John is the better offensive player still, but DeAndre's defense is great. If he can develop a consistent offensive presence, the combo of his abilities on both sides of the court will make him a more valuable player. In short, I believe that if DeAndre continues on that trajectory he had at the beginning of the season, other teams will be throwing large contracts at him as well when his time is up."
"Aaron Fentress--he's an insufferable dick who was shitting on everyone who suggested that trading Gary Trent and Nurkic for John Collins was a) impossible due to the cap and b) a bad trade for the Blazers.  Also, he called Westbrook better than Dame THIS YEAR which drew the ire of Dame."
Man I really wish the hawks could put it all together. Cam Reddish/Clint Capela/Trae Young/DeAndre Hunter/John Collins would be a really good frontcourt. Hopefully we can see it in the 2nd half
John Collins
"John Collins is not a great max player in this league.  He's a big with weak defense, he's not a playmaker, and he really makes you wonder if there's another step coming in his development or if this is really it.  The question you always have to ask yourself when you max a guy - can this team be a legit contender with this guy as one of my 3 best players?  If the answer is no, it's best to move on and let somebody else overpay.  In the case of Collins, I think you'd need to pair with two other All-NBA guys to have a chance.  I don't necessarily think Hunter is a major factor, it just makes the decision a lot easier to let Collins go knowing that Hunter is probably going to be a better player in this league than Collins."
Is that one of the main reasons you guys don't want to give the max to John Collins?
I really think your team should get in on the John Collins sweepstakes. Would love to see him in Portland with Dame and CJ
"I haven't watched the Hawks this season but if previous seasons are still the norm for him, then yea definitely a candidate. Rob is more of a crowd threat but John Collins (as far as my previous viewings are concerned) is the better navigator. Collins is just really good at making those opportunity happens"
Id throw John Collins in there...no bias
"what a waste of a draft pick. could have had Bam, John Collins, Donovan Mitchell, OG. SMH"
"His mobility is better against a bigger, slower defender.  Its not like Miami wants Bam with his back to the basket on the low post.  We want him high post with a slow, big center guarding him, then we run a shooter off him and make the defense decide between overplaying the shooter (which allows Bam to fake the handoff and dive to the basket) or leaving the shooter open.  If we got a 5 that could shoot and could protect the basket (no clue who that would be) that would be a great signing, but I don't see that happening.  Which is why John Collins seems like a more realistic target.  I do agree though that the Dipo signing is not a great fit for Miami.  Especially if Dragic, Nunn, Herro, Robinson are all still on the team."
"We could probably be a playoff team as soon as next season   It all depends on what direction we take. We have a chance of keeping our pick this year, and we have our pick next year. So tanking is an option, though tanking usually takes more than 2 seasons, and being awful further than that will only help okc not us   We also will have some good cap space to work with if instead of tanking we want to be competitive. Next season we have about 23m in the cap to use, and if we find a way to get rid of Gordon for an expiring or straight into someone‚Äôs cap, we will have basically a max slot   John Collins or Gary Trent Jr are decent options I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at if we overpaid slightly.   Wall Trent KPJ Tate Wood is a decent team. It‚Äôll depend on the depth and coaching but it‚Äôs not hopeless   It all depends on how we draft with the low picks we‚Äôll get from Brooklyn and bucks and trailblazers.   The ultimate goal is to retool to a low playoff level team. And wait until Brooklyn becomes old when we have their 2025, 26 and 27 picks unprotected"
"Because our third stringers are all actually good defenders and Iggy was playing heavy minutes during that time. I mean sure, defense is fine *now* but next year Iggy and Bradley are most likely gone which leaves Butler as the only above average wing (and guard) defender on the team.  John Collins would fit well in the team this season. Next season? Depends on the cheaper role players I guess and if they can replace the production of Iggy and Bradley. My money is on 'no'."
I don't think it'd work like that. We only have a league average or so defense because all our non-defense guys (basically the whole team other than Iggy and sort of Precious) are already bringing down Jimmy and Bam's defense. John Collins is super good but he'd be yet another guy bringing down Jimmy and Bam's defense.
"I hope it‚Äôs John Collins, the hawks have zero representation in the all star game and it‚Äôs in fucking Atlanta."
"&gt;For less $ I would prefer to take John Collins as of this moment.  if you think Collins will be the same or less money, I have a bridge to sell you"
"john collins, trent jr &amp; somebody is  gonna give one of the lakers guards 30 million"
I think we'd be better off panic-getting John Collins than panic-getting Dipo.
Surely you don't mean john collins?
"i mean no one really, maybe john collins?"
"Reading the article, it sounds like Pierce lost not just Trae's support but most of the team, including John Collins, Cam Reddish, and others.. Just sounds like communication and trust was gone."
John Collins is top out the list right now for free agents.
Not when it comes to the top guys getting minutes.  Which is the actual important players.  John Collins has the second most career games played of their top six players in minutes this season.  Trae is third.
John Collins with Jokic would be the worst defensive front court in the league
"How do you even fix Jokic's glaring defensive deficiencies?  Pick up a talented and versatile 6' 8""+ two-way player  that can check small ball fives and has the length and lateral quickness to rotate swiftly from the weak side corner to help contest interior shots?  How many of those players are even available?   Robert Covington, Christian Wood, and John Collins?  Oh, wait, they allowed someone who fit that mold perfectly that shined in the bubble to simply walk away."
"Mark Jackson stories copy pasted from another thread:   Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  Ran ISO-ball all the time  Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team  Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""  Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc) No preparation.  He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes"

My sleeper pick is John Collins.
"A few vet minimums could really help them. Aside from trading for Drummond which to me seems obvious, why not try Boogie Cousins for a bit. He won't cost anything. In the offseason they could have tried for Jae Crowder who would have been a great addition. You don't need stars, just some solid role players (eg. Joe Harris). John Collins clearly wants out of Atlanta, so how about taking him on."

"Harden is passing to Joe 50% 3-pt shooter Harris and Kyrie Irving - who are Luka, Trae, and Steph passing to? Luka is passing to Tim Hardaway/Jalen Brunson, Trae is passing to John Collins/Capela, and Steph is passing to Oubre/Wiggins - all substantially worse than Joe Harris and Kyrie Irving, which thus makes it harder to create assists."
"&gt;Ben's contact is the reason Powell fell like he did  Yes, I'm not denying that, it should indeed be a foul. I wouldn't even be too mad if it was called a flagrant on Ben.    My point is that ""hard fall =&gt; uneccesary contact =&gt; flagrant foul"" isn't necessarily true, and isn't how flagrant fouls are defined or called.    &gt;any hard contact that fucks how a guy is landing should be considered reckless   this is what the comment I replied to asserted. This is simply not true, even aside from this particular play in question - there's tons of examples of blocks throwing dunkers off balance and messing with their landing, none of which would be considered flagrant:  - [Shannon Brown on Mario West, called a foul, but clearly not flagrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCosVKXcmTE)  - [Kenneth Faried on Dion Waiters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNNtJsiZU4)  - [Blake Griffin on Deron Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t98hZOkoUIY)  - [Marquese Chriss on John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2YUOWbGwQA)  - [Gordon Hayward twice on the same play against the Celtics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHuflreCWs4)   Forget Simmons / Powell, these are all examples of hard blocks messing with a guys landing.

not if we make the playoffs. and porzingis can still be traded for an all star or borderline all star level player. like john collins...
Ignoring the effects these would have on the other teams:       To become favorites? Jokic/Embiid/KAT/AD \| CP3/Steph Curry       To be real contenders? Bam/Vucevic/Sabonis |  Lowry/DeAaron Fox/LaMelo       To be fringe contenders? Jarrett Allen/John Collins
John Collins and Gali could be a possibility if we sprinkled in some things along with KP.   Collins isn't resigning last I heard and we could eat Gali's contract for them.
"This is gonna get long but the deal would have been perfect if Oladipo was playing like his pre-injury self.  But the problem is that he isn‚Äôt.  So the Simmons deal was higher floor/ lower ceiling, while the Brooklyn deal was higher ceiling/ lower floor.  There are a few ways (most of which involve the Nets becoming bad) that the Brooklyn deal pays off:  1. The Brooklyn Nets‚Äô big three breakup and join new teams which can happen at the end of next season.  2.  Harden, KD, and Kyrie age horribly and cap out the Nets down the road  3. Brooklyn‚Äôs roster bottoms out due to injury   4. Some combination of all the above  5.  Houston uses those picks in future trades for star level players.  If any of those things happen this trade is a success, and whether or not it‚Äôs better than Simmons boils down to how high or low you are on him and who they eventually get in return alternatively.  Now it‚Äôs hard to speculate on these things.  The prevailing attitude seems to be that Harden, KD, and Kyrie will all age like fine wine, get along well and retire together in Brooklyn leaving all those picks to be in the 20s.  However even successful super teams can be short lived, and injuries can tank even the best of franchises-case in point Miami Heat with LeBron and the KD era Warriors.    But even if they get along well and even retire together, they will get older in years 2026 and 2027, Kyrie will be 34-35, Harden will be 36-37, and KD will be 37-38.  It‚Äôs difficult to say how good these players will be at those ages.  Just for perspective Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony are both 36 years old right now, while Dwight Howard and CP3 are both 35 years old.  DWade also retired at age 37 not too long ago.  So it‚Äôs very possible that by then Kyrie and Harden could be both be on bloated contracts and KD could be retired and still have no depth making for a very decent chance at at least two lottery selections there, although it‚Äôs tough to say how much carrying those guys will be capable of at that age.  So the best realistic case scenario for Houston is probably a combination of #2 and #5 where they trade most of those picks (excluding years 2026-2027) for young star caliber players (ie MPJ and or John Collins) while hitting big on their own picks and while still having 2 very valuable lottery selections in years 2026-2027  TLDR: We don‚Äôt know yet, it really depends on what happens with those picks/what Houston does with them. So time will tell"
KP for John Collins?
"How's John Collins doing? I haven't been watching much hawks games but his defence seems to have improved.   In hindsight, I'm glad we didn't re-sign Dunn."
"I think they both deserve to be All Stars. You clearly don‚Äôt watch any Hawks games you just watch the floplights that get posted here, he carries every facet of the offense when he‚Äôs on the floor and draws stupid gravity. They‚Äôve also dealt with a lot of injuries.   When Trae is off the court, the Hawks are literally straight dog shit. Can‚Äôt create shit on offense without him as well as Rondo being out. Dude is a top 5 playmaker in the league, John Collins is looking like a max player just because of him lmao.   Lavine is an insane scorer and IMO better than Trae at scoring this season, but their offensive outputs aren‚Äôt close, Trae‚Äôs floor vision is elite."
"I think I might be a genius for this, but feel free to tell me I‚Äôm dumb.    Kristaps for John Collins. Who says no?"
I always thought Portland would be an underrated spot for John Collins. Porzingis would be nice there too though
"i could see y‚Äôall giving him a good size contract this offseason. him or john collins, but i think Oladipo would fill a more important role for yall"
"Because he might be asking for a max and they may not want to give it to him. The same reason the Hawks might trade John Collins, for example. That definitely does happen. Gives them more cap flexibility of they don't trust Markannen to be worth paying 130 million dollars or whatever he might want"

"Philly gets shit because they were the most public alternative offer, but several other teams should get as much shit as them for not offering enough.   Like the Hawks could have put John Collins on the table and come up with a better offer than what the Nets could."
&gt;but does he actually help the Hawks win? Is he a strong enough defender in the post that warrants risking adequate perimeter defense?  That's a question for John Collins not Capella.
If there's one player I would like to change scenery it's John Collins. He just doesn't fit with this lineup and is being severly underutilized.
"* Apologies for not knowing John Collins' exact stat line off the top of my head, but I think what I said about him being an efficient, positive player who isn't having plays ran for him holds true. * Fair enough, but I did say injuries were an issue.  * Yeah that's not great, gotta concede on that one.  * I think Gallo's slump has a lot to do *with* Trae. He was fantastic on last year's Thunder with CP3. Why? Because CP3 is a natural playmaker who could put Gallo in good positions. This year, 50.4% of Gallo's shots come from catch and shoots. Last year, on the Thunder, it was only 45%. The year before, on the Clippers, 35%. They're using him like Ben McLemore when he's closer to Khris Middleton. Why? Because Trae has the ball so, so much. I know his sample size is small, but the same thing applies to Bogdan: on the Kings, 41% of his field goals came from catch and shoots, in nine games for the Hawks, it's 64%.  * The Bulls starting lineup is second-year Coby White, Lavine, rookie Patrick Williams, Lauri, WCJ. Otto Porter and Lauri have been injured for stretches, and they have no natural playmakers. They've repeatedly lost close games to contenders. Thad Young is the second best player on their team. Their roster talent is nowhere near comparable to y'alls, yet they're playing better. The Hawks are undeniably disappointing relative to the quality of players they've assembled.   As I said, it's not all Trae. Some of it is injuries, some of it is Pierce. But Trae has been this way since college. The ball is always in his hands, you live and die with Trae. And it makes him easy to scheme against. Look at y'alls first game against us (when most of your team was healthy, bar Gallo) and Trae was held to seven points. Why? Because when one guy has the ball, the issues of switching/rotations, tracking ball movement, positional size matchups, etc because less of an issue. That issue is magnified when the one guy who has the ball is a small 6'0"" tall guard. The Hawks should have feasted on the Hornets; we're a team that can't defend the three, has no inside presence (Capela had 19 rebounds), and a very weak bench. But if you stop Trae, you stop the Hawks, and we did it fairly effectively twice, despite missing Zeller and Devonte being in poor form."
"I don't want to take anything away from the Boston Celtics. They played 3 ish quarters of fantastic ball, but holy fuck Gallo and John Collins were *abysmal* tonight.  At least John Collins stopped shooting, however."
I didn‚Äôt watch the game but fuck you John Collins. Had a sick fanduel lineup going on which he ruined. That is all
@john Collins this is why Trae actually needs to have the ball 90 percent of the time. Because the rest of you are useless
John Collins is awful this game
"It IS a lot more than that.

Idk I think he‚Äôd probably look decent with a buzz. He‚Äôd look a little like John Collins when he had a buzz.
"I bet Hawks are going to be picky though.  If Travis Schlenk messes up the John Collins situation, it might cost him his job.  I think they will ask for a win now player and some picks."
Now I‚Äôm Interested in him. Him or John Collins
Get Danuel House or John Collins via trade

John Collins is so good
Celtics should give Theis and their 1st for John Collins.
John Collins in shambles
"Clint Capela, John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Danilo Gallinari and then there is Reddish and Dunn but they don't really hamper us. 3 starters (including a DPOY candidate and the league's leading rebounder and a guy like Gallinari who has been on fire is detrimental.  I'll take the downvotes, because I know its Grizzlies fans but the logic is mental. We have injuries and we are sitting players because we are 4th and it was a great time to do so. We were on a winning streak and got ourselves into position to where if we lose we are 4th if we win we were 4th. It was a back to back and people are sucking wind. We are like 13 and 5 since the all star break but the thread seems to think they played the normal Hawks roster and that was close to how we usually look.  But to stop ranting and just answer the question Capela and Collins are more significant than JJJ. Hunter has been out for a while but he is the best defensive player. Gallinari has been doing great and spaces the floor for us. We had a rookie playing center and a rookie backing that position up. A game ago we had 3 of those players."
"Ice cold take ü§î Never heard of John Collins, Bogi, Gallo, Huerter, or Hunter?"
"No sir, quite the contrary. John Collins is my best friend."
John Collins and Trae have beef
Just a friendly (salty) reminder that Thomas Joseph Thibodeau chose to draft center Justin Patton with Karl Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng under contract (then signed Taj Gibson to a 2/$28m contract less than 2 weeks later) over guys like John Collins and **OG Anunoby**.
"The Hawks have been missing Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, Okongwu for the first 20 games, now we are missing John Collins, before we had Capela go down, then Bogdanovic and then Gallo.  Heck, when we had Rondo, he barely played and we STILL haven't played a single minute with Dunn.  Every club has injuries.  Even the Lakers and even the Celtics.  The core of the team is Tatum first and then Brown.  When you have those two all-stars, most teams don't need more than that.  The problem with the Celtics is that they are top heavy.  After Tatum and Brown, you don't have any starter caliber players.   Fournier is not a star.  The Magic with him, Ross, Gordon and Nikola Vucevic still looked bad.  Then IMHO, they trade for Fournier but should have traded for Vucevic.  The problem is your GM, Danny Ainge.  Outside of Tatum and Brown, nothing.  Could have had James Harden."
"3 of our 4 best defenders have been out injured for weeks, one of whom is our 2nd best playmaker. Plus John Collins.  *This isn't even our final form*"
Probably because he called himself the greatest defender ever and then John Collins preceded to get a career high against him
22/10 with 1.6 blocks from wiseman and you would be ecstatic. John collins is kinda underrated just cause hes gonna get a payday.
"Yep, reallllly fucked us. I care less about the 26 pick but Zach Collins killed us.  But we didn't have 20 and 15 we just had 10 through a trade with SAC  Bam, Mitchell, John Collins, OG, shit even Jarrett Allen."
Im hoping desperately that they get John Collins. They combination of a luka Collins pnr would be devastating and I feel like he fits the team. He could also play alongside kp.  Unfortunately I‚Äôm pretty sure the hawks extend him. They would be crazy not to.  That being said the mavs now have two season where they essentially tried which player type fits next to luka and i trust them to get players that will fit alongside him and kp.
"  Full list:  1. Luka 2. Zion 3. LaMelo 4. Mitchell 5. Tatum 6. Fox 7. Simmons 8. Booker 9. Adebayo 10. SGA 11. Ingram 12. Brown 13. Murray 14. MPJ 15. Morant 16. Young 17. Mikal Bridges 18. Sabonis 19. Edwards 20. Ayton 21. Haliburton 22. John Collins 23. Jarrett Allen 24. Lonzo 25. Sexton  Every ballot had Luka and Zion as 1&amp;2, but 3 and onward varied."
We need an elite rim runner to pair with Luka. Good guard depth and wing in my opinion. Need someone out there who‚Äôs job is just to catch lobs from luka (someone like John Collins would be perfect). Additionally a backup center would be nice (moving off of WCS and Dwight Powell). Another potential solution is to sign someone like Richaun Holmes and start him at the 4 alongside KP.
If they could trade for John Collins he'd be perfect. I think the Hawks might want to pay him now though
"On a team with Trae Young and John Collins, he is most definitely a role player. A key role player, but a role player nonetheless."
"How about the fact we picked him over hometown OG and also John Collins?  Kinda shit that keeps a team mediocre right there.   Leafs' freaking ceiling was ""stretch 4 off the bench"""
"Honestly no one on the hawks. Maybe John Collins. Dude is good tho, but maybe a but overrated here"
"Overrated by who? By fans or by the general public?  Boban‚Äôs likable for instance but, the memes and random games where he goes 31/18 overshadow the fact that he‚Äôs an absolute sieve on defense.  I guess when it comes to our fans, Maxi was overrated when some fans thought we could get John Collins for Max and filler, though maxi and DFS both fill a great 3&amp;D role and make really low salaries (particularly DFS)  There is about half our fanbase though who hates everyone except Luka, lol. So no danger of KP being overrated. Maybe Brunson if he keeps his hot streak up, but I‚Äôve said before he could potentially be a Kyle Lowry type player."
"Obviously it‚Äôs gobert, but why is Clint Capela not even being talked about here. It would be a crime If he doesn‚Äôt make all defensive 2nd team.   Clint has been the only consist defensive presence in Atlanta, and has been a huge floor raiser for trae young and John Collins on D"
"John Collins was pretty bad defensively until this year, and now he's a really good defender. I think defense for a lot of players takes the most effort to learn and get good at. Judging him 2/3rds into a rookie COVID-impacted season is a huge mistake."
John Collins
"Lou Will, Clint, and Gallo carried us hard lmao and we're still missing Hunter, John Collins, and Cam. I like the team"
"The gap between him and Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Adebayo, Vucevic, Randle or even Siakam, John Collins and Sabonis is so big that you can not call that dude ""one of the best scoring big men"". He's right there with guys like Holmes, Valanciunas or Kanter - while Homles and big Jonas also play better D."
God I hope they get Cade + John Collins maybe and a new coach. It pains me what Beal and Russ have had to go through.

Good call. I can see Dallas throwing a lot of money at Lowry too although Luka handles the ball all the time for them. Knicks and Mavericks need to get a star to take it up a level next season but there aren't really many available free agents that really move the needle. John Collins is the prize but he's restricted and Atlanta will probably match even if they move him later.

He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes Not to mention that he was just a really horrible coach. I'm sure I left out a lot of stuff.  Post-coaching shitty things he did:  - Saying rim protectors are obsolete, which threw shade on Bogut, and then saying Deandre Jordan was the DPOY (over Draymond) because of his rim protection  - Wanting to take credit for Kerr's success talking about caterpillars and butterflies  - Saying Curry was not the MVP, which is fair, but not what you expect someone to say when Curry went to bat to keep Jackson's job. Maybe thought Curry didn't try hard enough, which is bullshit since Curry tried very hard and stumped for Jackson personally  - Saying Curry was ruining the game"
John Collins
"Kyle Lowry, John Collins, Robert Williams III, Anthony Edwards, Demar Derozan.  Defence blows so we're probably a first round exit."
"Luka, Wall, Lillard.   Those three easily would take John Collins on their team to be in contention for second best player on their rosters."
Was John Collins out all the other games against playoff teams too?  And in this alternate reality are we pretending AD was playing that game?
"Pacers:  1. Trading the Kawhi pick (and Davis Bertrans pick) for George Hill  2. Fucking up the chemistry on the 2014 team by trading granger and signing bynum  3. Firing (not re-signing for the nitpickers) Frank Vogel  4. The 4 year/$44m Monta deal, re-signing Stuckey and expecting that to be sufficient help for PG  5. Drafting TJ Leaf over Anunoby and John Collins"
John Collins burner spotted.
"Why are we *only* re-drafting the lottery? Why is pick 19, John Collins (5th in VORP) ineligible for your redraft? Why is pick 22, Jarrett Allen (4th in VORP) ineligible?   Lauri is #6 on this list, but 12th in the class."
"Yeah but you're not picking between the Nets and Celtics picks here, you're picking between the Nets and the Sixers+Celtics picks. Embiid is injury prone and Harden being old/retired affects the Sixers picks as well. And Sean Marks has a demonstrated ability to create at least mediocre rosters out of nothing. Nets picks are probably the slightly better bet against the Sixers picks in a vacuum, but if it's the Sixers picks + the Celtics/Hawks/Bulls picks + some young players, then that's also really good. I think the Wolves would also try to get Simmons, and that might be more appealing.  And if you could pull a John Collins for Simmons swap, then Minnesota has also been dying to get Collins, so you can at least turn around and sell him for something."
"I mean the Nets picks for the near future aren't really worth anything and, with Sean Marks as GM, none of the pick swaps are likely to convey. And then the Sixers deal might have fewer picks, though I'm not even sure about that, but you're probably still getting the far future picks, which are probably about as likely to be lottery picks as the Nets picks. And you can still tank as well. Simmons and Wall is about the worst basketball fit imaginable, and presumably John Collins is the only young player you could take back that would win you a meaningful amount of games.   Are you just going to say no to more picks + young players just because the second group of picks might not be that high?"
Lakers lost with lebron or wait does it not count because he only played 14 mins like John Collins did for us today?
"Felt like Trae had a bad night. He looked lazy at times and I could barely tell when he was on the court. Then I look at his statline and see he had 19 points, 13 assists, and 3 steals, and I'm just over here asking when all that happened.   As soon as we get a good lead, we fall apart and let the other team back into the game. Its happened all season, and it just makes me nervous for the playoffs. All that said, great to see Jae bounce back after a couple of bad games. He made some huuuge shots for us and played his brand of tough defense. Saric also seems to have snapped what slump he was in, or at least, is in the process of working through it. Another strong start from Ayton as well, but we keep losing him in the second half. I pray they're working on that.  GG Atlanta. You guys fought hard for that comeback. My wife asked me to leave the bedroom because I couldn't keep myself still while she tried to get comfortable to sleep. I hope John Collins is okay."
"Even after messing that up, they could‚Äôve gotten John Collins in that draft. But they drafted DJ Wilson instead lol"
"I think it‚Äôs wrong to completely attribute Tate‚Äôs success to playing time. The dude has been a beast. Fits the Draymond archetype perfectly. He‚Äôs nothing like a rookie and there‚Äôs a reason he gets so much time.   But yeah, saying we have one of the best young cores was a little ambitious. Point was that we have a jumpstart on a rebuild. And our young guys have easy pathways to minutes to develop too.  I think your evaluations are low of our rookies, but I‚Äôm also a biased homer so I get it lol. Wood was putting up all star numbers pre-injury. KPJ is only 20 years old and is probably the most talented guy on our team. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs absurd to think he has all nba potential. Tate/KJ Martin probably won‚Äôt be all stars, but they look like they‚Äôd be awesome role players. KJ himself is a highlight reel and while that usually doesn‚Äôt mean much, I don‚Äôt think we should sleep on how many guys he‚Äôs posterized or blocked. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô6‚Äù and has taken Gobert, Boban, Zeller, and John Collins‚Äô lunch already. I think it‚Äôs hard to definitively say most guys are All NBA locks or have that potential this early.   All of that plus we have a treasure trove of picks to improve."

"Feel like this would need to be separated between the levels of max.  Like, John Collins would get the 25% max. Most guys who show any sort of All-Star potential on their rookie contracts get that.  It's more interesting to think about the worst player you'd give the full 35% max (10+ years in the league) to."
"Usually players who are young and with high potential. To mind Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Lamelo Ball, John Collins, Ja Morant, Murray, Mitchell, MPJ. B- tier players that could probably go to A - tier. BI Murray and Mitchell are already all-stars."
John Collins

He kept John Collins quiet asf
Cant take you seriously when you got John fucking Collins over LUKA
"i can't believe we actually have cap space to sign two max contracts this off-season. the last time we had cap space to sign a max free agent was in 2015, when we got LaMarcus.  i think it's definitely in the Spurs' best interests to keep DeMar, but I feel like he may wanna ring chase.  John Collins would be a solid piece to get, if the front office decides to throw a big enough bag at him that Hawks won't want to match - but other than that I'm not particularly keen on anyone else (there is a certain nephew that we have unfinished business with but zero chance lol).  i really hope we don't end up signing a bad contract on some random ass player."
"We're in San Antonio and have tons of cap space. There's not many options for small market teams. We have to sign someone. I'd like John Collins more but I bet even if we offer a max, the hawks will match."
... I literally listed the Bucks as a team that made a major fuck up. You can point to a bunch of mistakes those other teams made too. Nuggets traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Traded Beasley despite him going off when he got starter minutes and being an extremely athletic lights out shooter. Blazers traded up for Zach Collins who's mediocre at best when he's actually healthy instead of staying back and being able to draft OG Anunoby and John Collins (both high upside players who were projected as good picks). Jazz are building around Mitchell/Gobert as their core which isn't their fault but also just not good enough to win a championship.
"But realisticly you only need him every 3rd of 4th game, Trae, Collins and Capella need to be at 60ish(25Trae, 20 John, 10ish or 15 Clint) and rest of the squad can take turns who is gonna show up"
"Lol it's not even close to the Nets' level. It'd be more accurate if say, Lakers traded Caruso, Kuzma &amp; Danny green for Damian Lillard. And then picked up Paul Millsap, John Collins, and somehow acquired Seth Curry. And Clint Capela"
"Hawks has Trae, Kevin Huerter, D Hunter and John collins in their starting lineup."
The truth is we actually don‚Äôt need to get John Collins. Collins is really a 4 and makes PJ kind of redundant. We‚Äôd be able to play some interesting small lineups but we need to true 5 and Collins isn‚Äôt that

The Hornets need to cash in their immense guard depth for defense or John Collins
I could see John Collins being a pretty good defensive end
John Collins
God DAMN john collins
Okay correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I heard Graham has been disappointing this season? Terry has looked good though if I were you I would keep him unless it meant bringing in a John Collins type of good young player.
Larry Nance Jr/John Collins/Jeremi Grant/Aaron Gordon   I think the pattern is clear...
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year ‚Äî and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 ‚Äî they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
Hawks? Could be a cheaper replacement if they let John Collins walk.
"Simons/Melo/Kanter is without a doubt the worst defensive trio in the league.  You could put prime KG &amp; Ron Artest with them and they'd still give up points hand over fist.  It is unreal to me that Olshey gets such a pass from the fanbase, he's incredibly high variance so his good moves (drafting Dame &amp; CJ, the Nurkic trade) seem to outshine so much of the crushing whiffs he's also had (giving Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard $200M in one summer, trading up to draft Zach Collins instead of Donovan Mitchell/Bam/OG/John Collins, drafting Simons without a clear path to development/reps).  Granted building a title team in Portland is incredibly difficult, but the way he seems to escape all accountability is crazy to me."
"i never understood the knicks drafting toppins when they had randle. even if randle left, they could have signed John Collins who is literally younger and better then toppins"
I'd love to see John Collins on the Heat tbh
"John Collins might possibly be the best finisher at the rim in the league. He just doesn‚Äôt have any ball skills, so he has to get fed a pass near the basket and can‚Äôt get there off the dribble. But once he does get there, he‚Äôs pretty much automatic. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he gets hit or needs to twist around, it‚Äôs going in if he gets it off near the rim. For reference, he‚Äôs shooting 74% from inside 3 feet for his career."
"Why wouldn't you trade Dinwiddie for Tucker? He can't possibly be in their long term plans as he can't play defense or shoot. Tucker can play defense and hit the corner three and play the 5 if you want to go small. If that's all they wanted, why don't they just take that?   How much can the Knicks offer Drummond if he hit FA right now and in any case, wouldn't it be better for him to wait until free agency so that he can field offers from more teams? I don't know why he would take a multi year deal if bought out right now when few teams have space to make a good long term offer.   I don't see anyone giving up a second for that Ellington contract. I'd rather sign him for the minimum after he gets bought out.   Seems like John Collins can be acquired for a relatively cheap price. Why don't the Warriors trade that rookie for him?"
John Collins to Minnesota for something centered around Malik Beasely and Jaden Mcdaniels  Harrison Barnes to Boston for Romeo Langford and a first  George Hill to the Clippers for Lou Williams and Detroit seconds
John Collins üòÇ
These guys got nothing on John Collins
Lmao i feel like this post was made just to shout out john collins but i am 100% here for that lol
"&gt; Another player of interest for the Celtics: Hawks big man John Collins, sources said. Atlanta‚Äôs asking price has been steep for Collins, however: A high-level first-round draft pick and/or a talented young player.  I like JC on Boston problem is there‚Äôs only so much tax Boston will pay next year with JC on a max no matter what they say publicly"

Yeah and Jimmy &gt; Zach and Lauri id do the trade again. Id just draft John Collins instead of him
We drafted him over john Collins so yeah.
"That was probably Doug Collins. Golden pairing with Bob Costas and that classic John Tesh music. Now, I guess the best we got is JVG."
I could have sworn John Collins was his son.
Anybody saying Draymond...Come on! He is still a good defender but hardly DPOY candidate I have seen him get destroyed numerous times this year. It was embarassing watching John Collins work him over earlier in the year 38/12 on 14/19 shooting.
John Collins
John Collins is my daddy
trae young to both john collins and clint capela
By immediately drafting John Collins. The rest is history!
Randle would have his hands full with John Collins.
"The rebuild was relatively short. The Hawks were only bad for 2 seasons really.  Last season, they had a bad record but they were essentially a .500 team once John Collins came back from suspension and then Covid hit."
One of the fastest turn arounds I've seen in a while. Hawks went from bird shit to hot shit in just a few years. Also I'll like any team with John Collins since his mom used to work with my dad
"I watched almost every single game of our rebuild. The emergence of John Collins, Dedmon learning how to shoot threes, the unrivaled athleticism of Alex Poythress, Ben Simmons talking about how bad we are while playing fortnite and then proceeding to absolutely shit on us, Alex Len batting Traes' lobs directly out of bounds with his cinder block hands... It wasn't always fun but I'm so glad I stuck it out, I love watching this team. Happy to be back!"
His name  Is John Collins  (And Bogdan Bogdanovic)
John Collins keeping the Bulls play-in dreams alive.
What a terrible pass by John Collins
So Hawks fans is John Collins a max player or not because I have no clue.
John Collins is gonna get paid.... by who is the question.
Wasn't there some drama with John Collins calling out Trae and Trae playing like garbage for a couple of games?
"I‚Äôm not hung up on anything‚Äî regardless, MPJ is just not close yet to a player like Trae because he can‚Äôt create his own shot or create for others.   To me, he‚Äôs on the same level as John Collins rn‚Äî a hyper efficient scorer who can‚Äôt dribble or create, but with an elite playmaker can be an elite scorer."
I‚Äôll do this era  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: AI  SF: Danny Green  PF: John Collins  C: Myles Turner  I tried to make it semi-realistic but I don‚Äôt know how realistic it would be. I tried putting 3 good defenders around (and John Collins isn‚Äôt terrible) as well as having good spacing so AI can have open lanes. Collins is also a great lob threat for him
Hawks average 4th most in the league at 24.2 a game so pretty in line for us.  Beal averages 7.7 attempts a game.  So yeah that's a pretty significant loss in terms of FTs y'all get a game (30% or so).  So yeah you likely could of had some more but it wasn't an egregious amount you were denied.  They also missed several foul calls in the Hawks favor (John Collins was mugged on our final possession btw).  The officiating just sucks this year
"&gt;Wizards down by 1, 7 seconds to go. John Collins gets his layup blocked and with 4 seconds left Gafford got the rebound and gave it to Russ and while they were down by 1 point with 3 seconds to go, Scott Brooks decided it was a good idea to not call timeout. Westbrook was forced to take a bad shot and the Wizards lost."

"That was a quality booty-slam by John Collins. Moving screens don't usually make for great highlights, but I enjoyed that one."
They‚Äôre 6th on Spotrac‚Äôs cap room rankings. But John Collins RFA will probably depend on a lot of that.
"Does John Collins not qualify for this list for some reason? Playing next to Clint this year he's definitely been a jump shooting big man, and he's sporting a 60.7 eFG%"
"This is a great post, but for tonight I think the rest advantage is too much to overcome for the wizards. B2B OT games with heavy load of Westbrook and one day rest. Hawks had a three day rest.   Then lets talk Beal. He is 18th in the league in PER, while Westbrook sits 49th in PER. The Wizards are 1-8 with Beal out. On the hawks side Capela is 11th, Trae is 21st, and John Collins is 34th in PER. This is a major stat and explains how Westbrook can stuff a stat sheet and still be -10 for the game. He's fun to watch and incredibly driven, just not efficient. The Hawks are a well rounded team with a lot of talent."
Scott is not gonna have us do that lol. We just gonna let Bertans get dogged by John Collins
"3 inch boost- Trae Young (6 ft 4 would make him insane)  Skill Boost- John Collins (great finisher, but him learning how to dribble and finish would be insane)  Athleticism Boost- Bogdan Bogdanovic (sniper, but imagine he had insane athleticism to get around guys)"
15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young 17. Mikal Bridges 18. Domantas Sabonis 19. Anthony Edwards 20. Deandre Ayton 21. Tyrese Haliburton 22. John Collins 23. Jarrett Allen 24. Lonzo Ball 25. Collin Sexton
"Shades of John Collins, who averaged 20 ppg on 66% TS"
"My gut says Eddie Jordan. I hated Doug Collins, but he at least managed to get those teams to the playoffs. The real answer is probably somebody like John Lucas who coached in the 90's post-Barkley and pre-Iverson and Larry Brown."
I just wanted to reply to your last point we need to give John Collins a max this offseason because imo he is a max level talent not being utilized enough in Atlanta but would be a perfect fit in OKC. If we somehow also land Cade I think we could be competitive as soon as next year.
"Trae, John Collins, Giannis, Embiid, Miles Bridges. This is a pretty interesting thread! I like seeing some of the lesser-known players that people like."
Oh ok so its not just our sub that has lauri and john collins threads every 3 days
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
"assuming all the vets leave, they sign different vets. but most john collins because he's great"
NBA does random tests for PEDs. Recently John Collins and Ayton were suspended for it.
on paper it makes way more sense that with our current mostly healthy roster we'd do better agains the knicks  but.. julius randle has made john collins his bitch every meeting this year and uh that could continue
"Rockets say no because that‚Äôs too little for their star player  Timberwolves would be stupid to do this since they could‚Äôve just traded for John Collins at the trade deadline, who in my opinion has a little bit more potential in the wolves system. Eric Gordon would be a good addition but it seems like were shooting ourselves in the foot if we do this."
"In the Bulls Hawks game, one of our players missed entirely but John Collins grabbed the net in mid-air while the shot was up so they gave it to us."
How to improve the roster? Porzingis for John Collins ?
"Anthony hit more game winners than John Collins, my guy.   - no source"
Just happened with John Collins.
"A lot of people still think John Collins is our second best player this year when he‚Äôs actually our 4th best player behind Trae, Capela and Bogi"
"Team ‚ÄúJM‚Äù:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team ‚ÄúRH‚Äù:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team ‚ÄúJC‚Äù: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team ‚ÄúLD‚Äù:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
"They should try to get John Collins, but they have no assets"
"Is our second best player John Collins? Then yes. Is our second best player Capela, Hunter or Bogi? Probably not but maybe. I really don't know how the fit would work between Trae and Ben."
"John Collins would be awesome but I doubt we can afford him, otherwise honestly I want to take a flyer on Marvin Bailey if the Kings let him go"
Wood will not be getting a max lol - he could get an overpay at like $30m/year but he just isn't that level of player.  John Collins may reluctantly get a rookie max and he is a better offensive player and the same quality of defender as wood and he has way more to grow.
"Hawks should get some credit. Yeah they traded Luka but still got an all-star in Trae out of it, not to mention Huerter and John Collins at 19, and the great trade up for Deandre Hunter. Jury still out on Reddish and Okungwu"

John Collins seems like the obvious candidate for Spurs
"Why exactly is John Collins just putting up 8 shots? From the statsheet, it seems like he was a bucket today"
Feel like asking between Randle and John Collins would be a more interesting question
"How did you pass up on John ""The Baptist"" Collins?      Also, Kev's nickname is Red Velvet, or Kevin ""What she don't know won't"" Huerter"
I think that John Collins injury which opened up shots for him was huuuuge.
Capela and John eat so much from Trae's passes. They don't score nearly as much without him. Collins looks like a max guy a lot of times because of Trae's dimes.
Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
They are really deep and can shoot the 3 really well. You have Trae Young scoring a ton and getting a lot of easy assists to Capela and Hueter on the outside. Then you got John Collins banging down low.   It‚Äôs crazy how they fired LP and they start doing amazing
Is John Collins ever not injured?
"John Collins is fr exactly like every 2k build this year lol. 6‚Äô7 can shoot, dunk like crazy. He just doesn‚Äôt have the handles or defense"
John Collins is an all star talent but it‚Äôs getting hidden in Atlanta with his usage. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to give this guy a max rn.
"Lmao and the top comment is mocking the Hawks for John Collins comment while they were slumping early. 101 days later, and both teams are in position to make the playoffs outright, rather than having to compete in the play-in."
Because Thibs was ass at drafting. In his two drafts as POBO his best pick was Okogie. He took Dunn over Murray and Justin Patton over guys like OG and John Collins.
John Collins signs w/ Charlotte Hornets. Lonzo Ball to NY Knicks
"It's funny because in that thread, there's another guy who linked to a post about the hawks being 0-4 since John Collins said they weren't a joke, and saying that the lesson is never to hype your team. But now both the Knicks and hawks are good lol"

I still think john collins + luka would be disgusting
"Powell was an elite rim roller before the injury and is the only reason why he got that 11m/per. If he keeps this up, Mavs might be able to save that offseason money on something else than say, John Collins."
"If John Collins could improve his ballhandling and shot creation like Randle has, he‚Äôd be an all star talent"
"The difference comes down to Trae and John Collins wanted Pierce gone.  Walton is a known commodity and has albeit brief success. Saunders was tricky because of how long he and his family had been tied to the team, plus when the stars aren‚Äôt asking for you to be fired, you tend to keep your job.  For as bad as Brooks has been, again if Beal wanted him gone he would be gone.  I think Pierce is a great man and I hope he gets another shot, but it was such a short leash because this team should be competing for a mid number seed and they were headed towards the lottery under Pierce.  That‚Äôs really the difference. If you are a first time NBA coach, you don‚Äôt get the leash. Look at Phoenix of the last few years."

Someone like John Collins might be attainable honestly, even if he's not the kind of 3-4 guy you're looking for. The Hawks don't seem fully invested in him (with Capela, Gallo, and a ton of young guys that can slot in at the 4 in Okongwu and (small ball) DeAndre Hunter and Reddish), and he's young enough to keep improving as Dame's prime tapers off"
2 year old article lmao. John Collins is way improved as a defender since then same with Booker.   Trae‚Äôs advanced stats are still bad but not dead bottom like they were 2 years ago
"He didn‚Äôt get pulled... he was on a minutes‚Äô restriction because he just came back from injury. Also Randle was on fire from 3, but he only made 5/13 shots inside the arc. Rim protection wasn‚Äôt even a problem with him this game even though he‚Äôs clearly not 100%. Don‚Äôt take it from just me though. Read anything from one of our best writers about John, and you‚Äôll see them talk about his positive presence in the paint on the defensive end.   Randle is having a better season this year, but Collins was much better last year, is several years younger, and a far better fit with our budding superstar."
"...John Collins, Bogi, Galo, Hunter."
Clint capela and John Collins would both easily be the second best player on the knicks
John Collins wouldn‚Äôt get a max contract in the WNBA. That dude is crazy.
"""Like, are we SURE the Hawks are good? All we hear is Trae young this Trae young that, but......  Clint Capela? Always outplayed in big games with Houston  Nate manikins? Never won in the playoffs with Indiana and Portland  Bogdan? The guy who put up empty stats on the nets/kings  John Collins? The guy with that awful dunk contest attempt over a plane  The Knicks, with a possible COY and MIP and defense and those crowds lose to........ that""  This was the text of that post lmao"
After he intentionally dove at John Collins' knees I lost all respect for him
John Collins should be on the Hawkers over Marcus Morris
John Collins would start over Marcus Morris for sure
If you knew anything about the Hawks last season you‚Äôd know there were not many good things about the roster last season. Hunter started out hot then seemed to hit the rookie wall. Reddish started out super shitty then became a lot better when he was moved to the bench later in the season and played against the other teams second units. Reddish has been too  injured this year to get an actual read on him yet. Huerter was very inconsistent night to night. John Collins was good when he came back but he still missed more than a third of the season. Go ahead and look at last years roster to try to find your ‚Äúbut he had‚Äù guy.
"It‚Äôs based on the stats. After last season, Dallas had the best offensive rating (pp/100 possessions) of all time.   But hey, when Trae and John fucking Collins are holding the Larry O‚ÄôB this year I‚Äôll give you all the props in the world."
How wild would it be if Embiid dove into John Collins knee
"This comment is funny but I feel like it does a really bad job of explaining how hard the Hawks make it to close down shooters like this on the perimeter. John Collins, Onyeka Okongwu, and Clint all routinely set really hard screens against smaller Philly defender constantly and make it really hard to just shadow/double a player like Lou. Lou, Gallo, and Bogi and trae are high % 3 point shooters ans that lineup + Collins exploited phillys defense against Atalanta screens and Lou started cookin"
Refs must hate John Collins lol
"He‚Äôs the biggest reason for sure. But don‚Äôt count out the rest of the Hawks who played exceptional in the entire second half. Galo hit most of his shots, that rookie tall guy did a great job defending Dwight, John Collins had some difficult rebounds, Trae with the clutch baskets and free throws in the last 3 minutes, Capella doing a great job defending Embiid. All 5 Hawks players throughout the entire second half played so well, it was really a team effort. Hawks don‚Äôt come back without Lou Will‚Äôs performance though."
John Collins and Lou Will's stock are going through the roof!
"Well gosh why did they keep fouling him? Embiid drew a T on a flop. Korkmaz drew three free throws by flinging himself into John Collins. So what it seems like is that the 76ers are trying to do the exact same thing Trae does, except 1) Trae is not an abjectly poor free throw shooter and 2) Trae‚Äôs offensive prowess induces more guys to bite on his pump fakes. Easy solution: don‚Äôt contest him so hard! Give the man some space and let him try to hit his shots if you‚Äôre so sure he can‚Äôt do it."
Sorry when you say ‚Äúcheap foul calls‚Äù are you referring to the literal exact move Korkmaz pulled on John Collins in the first quarter?
EMBIID IS STILL A TURBO BITCH FOR DIVING AT JOHN COLLINS‚Äô KNEES. FUCK THAT DUDE HAWKS IN 6
"these playoffs man, John Collins requesting the support of the arena for Simmons on the line ... in Philly.  WHAT.A.GAME  Doc coached Clips he should have known to double Lou straight away, that man orchestrated the comeback"
You mean when he dove at John Collins‚Äô knee? Or a different time
Pay John Collins. That is all.
Trae and John Collins are two animals
I love John Collins talking all that shit even if it is against the sixers
John Collins talking some shit to the fans. Love to see it
 Huuuge block by John Collins
"John Collins more impactful in crunch time than Embiid is, you love to see it."
John Collins is FIGHTING for that max contract
Someone better pay John Collins the big Bucks
John Collins always looks baked
John Collins come here bb
Haha John Collins trolling Sixers fans
Then it looks like John Collins is 6'7 in shoes on a good day. He looks almost guard-sized out there. And I just got new glasses today so I know it's not my eyes deceiving me.
John Collins having a good game to
"Ah yes, the legendary beef Embiid has with John Collins. Good grief."
If John Collins is 6'9 then I'm about 6'2. He's smaller than Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons. Harris is listed at 6'8 and Simmons at 6'9. I can see now why he slid to the 19th pick.
John Collins putting up deceitful stats to fight for that max contract
John Collins climbing up my list of favorite ever JC's
"Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Clint Capela, John Collins, and Bogdan have all collided while diving for a loose ball at center court, exploding in a giant mushroom cloud. Wells Fargo Center has been reduced to rubble."
"Highly dependent on the matchup. Against stretch 4s with a limited ball handling or post game, yes. Against wings with good lateral quickness, no.   John Collins and Bogdanovic are great matchups for him this series, so he‚Äôs looked very good defensively so far. Next series when he has to guard one of Durant, Harden, or (unlikely for multiple reasons) Kyrie, he‚Äôll look somewhere between bad to abysmal."
John Collins looked like he air strikes himself and had no self rez
I'm going to choose to believe that John Collins 3 before the half is the momentum starter we need to start a comeback.
I guess John Collins just fell down on his own like Embiid üôÑ
It'll be a competition between John Collins and Ben
Yo what does John Collins provide a contender at PF?
Tobias Harris looks bigger than John Collins.
"Man management - LP is a terrible man manager. Everyone of his players hated him. He lobbied to other coaches that Trae shouldn't make the all-star game. Told Trae to wait his turn when it comes to representing the U.S after Pop chose Derrick White over him. Publicly complained about how Trae draws fouls. It come out after his firing that Cam Reddish felt that he was being bullied by LP. John Collins asked for a bigger role in the offense and LP called him selfish. Players said he was unapproachable and regularly lobbied for change through his assistants.    Terrible rotations - For some reason he had a hard on for giving Bruno Fernando minutes even though everyone could see Bruno Fernando is a bonafide scrub and we have a Okongwu our 1st round pick who is 10x the player he is just sitting on the bench. Regularly ran out trash lineups for far too long. We'd be up big with 4 minutes left in the 3rd and down double digits with 8 minutes left in the 4th.    No schemes - He literally doesn't have an offensive or defensive scheme. His scheme was hope Trae puts up 40pts and 15asts.    Also Bogi's injury came back ahead of schedule after LP was fired. Take that for what you will. LP is a terrible coach and I hope any eastern team takes him and gives us free wins next season. We had 11 blown 4th quarter leads with LP and became the best 4th quarter team in the league with McMillan. LP doesn't know when to call timeouts, doesn't ever hold himself accountable and I genuinely can't think of one positive thing when it comes to LP's coaching."
"Gosh, it would be terrible if someone's opinions were ""extremely heavily influenced by reputation"". Someone like that would probably make claims that weren't backed up by reality - definitely want to avoid being one of those people.  In totally unrelated news, here's what advanced stats say about Lebron's defense this year  * 18th in [DEPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), between Marc Gasol and Rudy Gay * 26th in [DRAPM](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=-2146555570), between Duncan Robinson and Brad Wanamaker * 40th in [Real Plus-Minus](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), between Steven Adams and Jae Crowder * 92nd in [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/), with the same rating as Jokic and John Collins * DWS tied for the lowest of his career * DBPM below 2.0 for the fifth season in a row  Interesting.  &gt;awards that are extremely heavily influenced by reputation  Wait...you you actually think that *Lebron James* hasn't been named to an All-Defensive team since 2014 because of a lack of reputation? That's delusional. His reputation (well-earned because of those late Cavs/early Heat years, when he was one of the best defensive players in the league) is basically the entire reason why stans keep insisting he belongs in these conversations despite the fact that he hasn't actually been an All-Defensive level player in years.  &gt;I recommend actually watching the games  [**The people who vote on NBA awards**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1KMzwRcilLDej0BWl7eYE_OYC9Tx9olI_Ptn-nHjKfpQ/htmlview) **are literally employed to watch the games**, and not just the ones involving the player they stan. Basketball is their career. They haven't put Lebron on an All-Defensive team since 2014 because he has not been one of the best defensive players in the league since 2014. Other than that, great comment."
Nba players love Atlanta so I could see someone wanting to go there  The big decision right now is what do they do with John Collins. Do they max him or let him walk
They'd need insane development from their role players and hope John Collins leaps into superstardom next year.
"They were only the 7th seed because he was injured and missed those games. If John Collins doesn‚Äôt dive into his ankle, LeBron plays a full season and the Lakers are a 2 seed. He would have been 1st team over Kawhi and been top 3 MVP."
Giannis is the clear answer. Westbrook comes to mind.  John Collins isn‚Äôt at that level talent wise but worth a mention.  Of course there is Oubre but his looks make up for the lack of basketball IQ.
"John Collins, Bogdonavic, and Trae Young are their top three scorers. Hunter &amp; reddish averaged 15ppg &amp; 10ppg. That‚Äôs like saying the Sixers lost Danny Green and Curry. Third/fourth/fifth option guys. Everyone else that is injured is either a 1/2 option. You missed the point!"
"Could be a three way trade. Maybe something where you end up with Bogdan Bogdanovic and John Collins, Portland gets Ben, and Hawks get CJ and picks from Portland"
I'm rooting for the hawks because Trae and John Collins are insanely fun to watch. But this might change my mind...
"He didn‚Äôt play great defense. Embiid missed that layup at the end from not elevating properly he blew right past capela. He grabbed rebounds which is his job but he didn‚Äôt do anything special. I get that you‚Äôre a Hawks fan so you have to hype up your guy but get serious. John Collins, Trae Young, Bogdonavic, even Hurter all took over on a run I. The second half while Embiid struggled he was moving slow and caustious because of his knee he went 0-7 in the third quarter on simple shots he usually hits. The injury obviously affected him. He was avg 39ppg on Capela prior to last night let‚Äôs not act like he can guard Embiid. Get real with yourself dude"
"He talking shit while Embiid has a meniscus tear in his knee while still averaging 30+ with 11+ rebounds on this guy‚Äôs head cut it out. They won because he couldn‚Äôt elevate. He missed easy layups pretty obvious the injury was affecting him. He had zero impact on the win. John Collins sparked that come back, Trae young and Bogdonavic were hitting tough shots. He was missing layups and dunks just from seeing Embiid out the corner of his eye."
"Lol a word to the wise, quit while you're ahead.  You're in a bit over your head here.    &amp;#x200B;  1.  I bring up Joel's 21 rebounds because you tried to make it seem like he wasn't effective on defense.  He was, to the tune of 21 rebounds, and he altered multiple drives by the Hawks that won't show up in the box score.  The Hawks are the best lob team in the NBA.  If you look at which point guards have passed the most lobs to which big men this season Trae to John Collins and Trae to Clint Capela are both in the top 10.  If embiid was not in the game it would have been lob city in the A last night and the Hawks would have won by more.  Period.   2. The hawks have the leading rebounder in the NBA in Clint Capela, are 14th in offensive rebounds and 6th in defensive rebounds.  But they're not a good rebounding team.  Sure.   3. Saying that a team would play better if their most inefficient offensive player didn't shoot the ball as much is a lazy argument and not actual basketball analysis, hence why I haven't acknowledged it.  You literally would have to assume that other players would pick up the slack when Seth Curry was the only 76er starter that had a good shooting night.   Trae and Bogi combined for like 12/50 last night, maybe if they would have just not taken those shots in the first half the Hawks would have won by 20.  See how dumb this argument is?    &amp;#x200B;  Are we finished here yet?"
"The thing with John Collins is that he has a lot of room to grow. He's one of those guys that picked up basketball later in his life but has a lot of the things you like in a big guy.  His defense still leaves a lot to be desired, but if the Hawks can hold on to him, he will be huge"
"I think JC could really thrive on a different team, he was playing well before Trae got there as well. Now, he's not a superstar talent, but he's probably something like a Tobias Harris-level piece, nice player who can bring the juice sometimes. Biggest thing John Collins does is bring energy and leadership."
John Collins just won't accept 1/12.  That was amazing help defense.
"We cannot contend with Collins as well, really inconsistent player. And from a Hawks fan, his defense is actually terrible. Yes he get the highlight blocks, yes he hustles for boards sometimes but that is it, he don't got presence. he slow in the perimeter, and rarely successfully contests shots unless he gets a piece of the ball, I've watched every Hawks game since 2020, and that is clear from John. We just gonna try something new, I'd live or die with KP. Maybe he'd be something better with Coach Nate, he did make Trae hustle more on defense."
John Collins is kinda goofy looking and then he hits those put backs and lobs and just looks like such a fucking athlete
Shit like this is exactly why the Hawks can't let Collins walk. That whole play was just Collins and Trae vs 5. In the clutch they always just have these stretches where they feed off each other. John Collins basically saved the game.
John Collins played fantastic
John Collins needs to flop more. He gets beat up and never gets calls.
John Collins was immense in the second half. It dosn't show up in the box score just how much those dunks in the 3rd quarter impacted the game. Kept our hearts in the fight.
Uh... You mean John Collins and the squad?!?! Dude was in full-on BEAST MODE.
John Collins has 37 offensive rebounds
John Collins somehow managed to miss guaranteed buckets all game long
"right... so when he pushed john collins and then capela removed his hand off him from boxing out and he fell down, he got hacked pretty bad didn't he"
John Collins putbacks in the third quarter really changed the momentum of this game
Why are you talking about Embiid after he shoved John Collins on a Trae Young post?
John Collins is a bad man.
how did we fucking win that game? Nates routine shit clock management and John Collins being a dumb fuck
It was clearly his face. From a dude who doesn‚Äôt even like trae young. Anyways Embiid got 2 freethrows for shoving John Collins to the floor so sixer fans shouldn‚Äôt be complaining
SEND JOHN COLLINS TO FUCKING SACRAMENTO
John Collins shot that pass out a cannon
John Collins is not a max player
You don‚Äôt want John Collins playing hero ball like that damn.
John Collins ugly as hell AND bad at basketball
Game on the line and you have the ball in John Collins hands‚Ä¶ yikes
John Collins has the basketball IQ of a goldfish
fouls on john collins... john didn't touch him
I am watching this game for one man only. John Collins.
They‚Äôre for John Collins
Embiid gotta go to the paint John Collins and Acapella arent doing shit
JOHN COLLINS TRYING TO EARN HIS 90 MILLION BACK
JOHN COLLINS LMFAOOO
John Collins is STILL crying lol  flex or cry dude. make up your mind
John Collins still on the refs ass
Also John Collins
Embiid trying to fold John Collins in half lol
"Good God, John Collins might be one of the worst players in the NBA."
John Collins is soft lol.. how do you not score over a shorter guy
Trae is probably the least likeable player in the league.  Dudes a flop.  John Collins is a bum.
"they got trae, john collins, lemon pepper lou and a couple others which are likeable"
Dwight and John Collins flirting with each other
John Collins fouled Dwight's elbow with his face
It's remarkable how cool John Collins stays.
Hahahaha John Collins.  Dude is a grade A bum.
John ‚ÄúDwight Howard‚Äù Collins
They are too busy sucking off john collins
Every John Collins putback takes 2 years off my life
john collins really pushed the momentum entirely in the hawks favor.  also traes passing has been sensational
John Collins.
"Shortened offseason after a ring. Injury prone star, and LBJ got old without his midseason vacation(aka hgh influx). They‚Äôll be back in it next year, hopefully with another offensive weapon like a drose or john collins.  Problem with Legler‚Äôs take, is you can do that every year with the playoffs. Hell, you can do it this year! Harden and Kyrie dont get hurt, nba finals would already be over."
"Davion falls outside the lotto  Kuminga falls past 7th overall  Sengun goes top 14  Wagner goes top 10 (not sure how controversial this is)  Luka Garza gets drafted in the second round  To your take on KP, I could see Bagley/Hield/9th overall being a fair package for him. I've thrown that out there as a savvy move for the Kings. I think that and maxing John Collins would be a big step forward for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/KP/Collins isn't a contender by any means but it's at least going to compete for the playoffs, which is what they need desperately"
"&gt; You guys   I'm a Celtics fan.   &gt;I thought it wasn‚Äôt teammates so much as the head coach?  The Hawks 2nd best player was Jabari Parker through John Collins' suspension lol. Cam Reddish shot 38%, Deandre Hunter 41%, Vince Carter was playing legit minutes for them, etc.   Their team was awful last year, legit contender for worst in the league, and easily worst in the league for the 25 games Collins was suspended."
"they should try for a sign and trade but if they can't get one they shouldn't throw money at him, dinwidie's worth 18 million a year, if he doesn't want that they should let him walk, it's kind of like the john Collins situation"
"I know you prolly mean John Collins, but I wouldn't be surprised if they gamble on Zach Collins"
"No it wasn't correct. You will never win anything meaningful on the backs of 1 player alone. You could say the same thing about the hawks. Who do you want with the ball in their hands over Trae? Bogdanovic? Huerter? John Collins? It's not even about being the main ball handler, it's just about getting other players involved and not holding onto the ball for most of the shot clock, even when he's not creating anything.  And the whole acting like the Mavs roster is full of scrubs to prop up Luka is pretty ridiculous when their net rating with Luka **off the floor** in his 3 seasons is +0.4, +4.2, and +0.3; also Kristaps literally averaged an efficient 20 and 8 this season"
Jrue ‚ÄúFederal‚Äù Holiday   Reggie ‚ÄúBig Government‚Äù Jackson    John ‚ÄúBicameral Legislature‚Äù Collins
"Said this in a comment the other day, there are so many talented young players that could be playing a major role for our team, instead of letting KD lead the team he could spare some of the offensive load. No offense to Keldon Johnson but like man we could do way better. Ayton John Collins, Bridges, Randle, Ingram, Zion... so much wasted potential this year."
"Yeah I agree it's unlikely to happen. but thanks for finding a reference. So only 20% has to be base. I mean, the All-Star one is a good example. John Wall obviously wouldn't be considered likely. Lots of players are on that All-Star bubble that teams might be happy to juice their deals with incentives like that-- if your 15M or 20M guy becomes a 25M guy if they're a lock for All-Star, no problem. Imagine.. Lonzo or John Collins or Colin Sexton or Wiggins or lots of players like that."
"Yes, but the Bucks, for example, are a small market team and they are owned by multiple billionaires. Not one. Three. No team in the league is a charity, they could all compete to pay. It‚Äôs just that some wouldn‚Äôt. I think that it‚Äôs crazy that the max for a guy like lebron is essentially the same as a guy like John Collins. Make a salary floor, the cap is just there to save rich white dudes money."
"Trae Young, John Collins, Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish and 7 firsts"
"John Collins is good at lobbing the ball to Capela from the FT line on the short roll, and has literally no other passes in his arsenal lol.  Pascal Siakam sometimes creates extremely good passes to layups or corner 3s by isoing and convincing everyone he's about to take a bad shot, and then throwing a bullet at the last second. The rest of his passing arsenal is pretty meh.  Devon Booker's skip pass to the weakside corner is like 10x better than any of his other passes"
Who is a better deal? Not Dennis. Not CJ Mccollum. Not John Collins.  Who you want to sign?

"Cuban collecting extremely white Europeans like Infinity Stones lol.  That John Collins pick seems random but idk much about either to properly criticize it so whatever.   Why would the Knicks sign Derozan? And Schroeder to Heat?  I definitely want to see your thought process for the Dame trade, though I'm guessing it's Sabonis + picks which isn't worth it for either team imo.  He's home pick with Wiggins, kind of requires a trade so I want to know what the trade is."

"I think it's a tossup honestly. I wouldn't be shocked if he gives them through the All-Star Break, and then assesses his future with the team. I just don't see him staying on this team if they make zero moves.  What sucks for the Blazers is that if Oshley could draft this wouldn't be an issue. They had the 15th, 20th and 26th pick in 2017 and managed to come out of the draft without a single player as good as Kyle Kuzma, who went 27th that draft. Could have had Jarrett Allen, John Collins and Kuzma."
"I‚Äôm sure there are, but what are those teams doing then? Yes, plenty lot of teams can beat a Simmons for dame swap, but those teams that can beat it will just end up like Portland since they don‚Äôt have the star power outside of dame to do well, or they end up like Houston after they traded James harden. But I‚Äôm pretty Houston would take Simmons over what they got from the nets for harden right now.   Dame  is 31 , if you trade for him , you‚Äôre in win now mode. And there are few  teams that have 30 million in contract players to to match  the caliber of Simmons, and  even less of those teams have picks to go back.  And the teams that have dead salary aren‚Äôt good enough to compete once they do get dame since their team right now doesn‚Äôt have players like CJ and Nurkic. The warriors have Wiggins, and picks the hawks have a sign and trade of John Collins, and picks and that‚Äôs pretty much it in terms of teams in win now mode that dame will push over the top, maybe the Pelicans if they want to move off Ingram. But teams like the magic, pistons, pacers, kings, twolves. You have to give up so much just to get him and they are so far away from the top that it doesn‚Äôt make sense. You‚Äôll be trading to go from 10th to 5th or 6th."
"Wood, Allen, John Collins if he counts as a big man, Deandre Jordan, just off my head to be honest.  &amp;#x200B;  also apologies for jumping right out the gate"
Crazy to think they could have had John Collins and OG or just like idk Bam... or at that moment traded CJ and take Donovan.  Trading up for Collins who could have been there at 15. And then taking OG at 20 who was falling cause of injury (Fell to 23)
"Its not terrible tbh, but too mediocre to win a championship.  The 3 big issues are the 2016 offseason, the 2017 draft, and the general inability to bring in a starting-worthy small forward.    2016- tons of money thrown at Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner, which was a complete waste.  2017 draft- the bigger issue isn't that he drafted Collins, but that he traded the 15 and the 20 to get him at 10.  It wasn't even clear that we needed to trade up for him.  If you also look at who else was available, whether at 10, 15, or 20, the potential Portland team is just so much better.  Also, at 26 he took Swanigan.  3 of the next 4 picks were White, Kuzma, and Hart.  This Portland team *could* have had Mitchell or Bam, or John Collins AND OG/Jerrett Allen AND Derrick White.  Instead we've got broken Zach Collins and the ghost of Swanigan.  Forwards- Since Batum and LMA left, the ONLY starter quality forward we've had is RoCo.  We've had solid bench-quality forwards like Harkless, Aminu, DJJ, and Melo, but we've never had a real 5 man lineup."
"Who is Collins, John Collins? That's somebody who actually can't guard bigs, Wood can."
John Collins for SGA type beat
"At 10 they could have picked Donovan Mitchell or Bam, at 15 they could have taken John Collins, at 20 they could have taken Jarrett Allen or OG.  Fuck they could have gotten Kuzma at 26, at least he's still in the league.  Also could have just traded 15, 20, 26, and CJ for Paul George, that's absolutely a better looking package than Oladipo and Sabonis at that time.  Instead they got one player who has almost never played in Zach Collins and another that's already out of the league in Caleb Swanigan."
John Collins
"Dude, those players I mentioned were all players available at our picks.   Can you imagine how much better we would be right now if we had John Collins and OG anunoby?"
"We had tons of assets and got nothing from them  We had 3 firsts in one of the best drafts in recent years and came out with swanigan and Zach Collins. Could've had John Collins, OG anunoby, Jarrett Allen, etc.   Or flipped those assets and future picks for a star"
Trae Young and John Collins are available Pop. But first you gotta fire El Pee
What about John Collins?
"Sexton would be a nice replacement for Beal's spot now that he's out, imo, idk why that dude gets hate but he could do well in a similar role as Beal. He's a walking bucket, great shooter and great off-ball.   MPJ, John Collins, and JJJ would be good good replacements for Jerami Grant now that he's out. I'd also take any of those guys over Kevin Love right now.  I'm assuming you forgot Ja, but he's another great young PG who could play instead of Trae if he were to be injured or not play. Maybe not the same level of playmaker Trae is, but he's still a good passer and altogether dynamic player.  IMO, I think Team USA could've definitely used a classic 7 footer type center to matchup size if needed over Kevin Love, and Jarrett Allen is probably the best USA product to fit that mold right now. Bam is good but he's more of a skilled small ball 5 and hybrid 4, fits a different profile. Draymond as well, he's a point forward PF ideally."
"I‚Äôve never watched a regular season game of NBA basketball. I just watch the playoffs.   I‚Äôve been to a regular season game, and it was Vince Carter‚Äôs farewell year on the Hawks. Trae dropped 30 points against the Magic, VC came off the bench with 2 or 3 awesome dunks. It was the coolest shit ever. I knew the Hawks were going to be insane. Then John Collins got busted for steroids, and their season was fucked."
A side kick is like a Manu. Tony Parker is not a side kick.  A side kick is like a John Collins. Pau Gasol was not a side kick.   Simmons is a side kick. Kobe was not a side kick.
"john collins, myles turner or jarrett allen, kinda rough"
"Lauri to the Hornets is fun! I also love Frank as a minimum guy on the Warriors, I think he could thrive there off the bench as a spark plug on D.   Josh Hart would be a great glue guy on a contender like the Clippers or Lakers maybe or even Jazz   John Collins on the Hawks is the move but if not him on Dallas would be crazyyy   Lonzo would be cool on the Bulls  Jarrett Allen is likely staying in Cleveland"
"John Collins- Hawks, they‚Äôll likely match whatever, and it‚Äôs better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he‚Äôs in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that‚Äôs even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I‚Äôll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
"It'd be dope to get Jarrer Allen but I doubt the Celtics could afford his asking price which I assume to be huge money.   I hope Lonzo stays with the Pels. They could build something there. If not, maybe CHA so he could play with his brother then MJ will sign the other Ball brother so he could have a complete collection.   John Collins would probably still be in ATL.   I don't mind getting Lauri for the Celtics. I can see him with the Mavs."
"John Collins - ATL  Lonzo - S&amp;T to CHI  Markkanen - no clue honestly... I'm gonna say S&amp;T to BOS  Frank N - OKC (seems like a Presti type prospect)  Monk - CHA  Zach Collins - POR   Allen - Cleveland if they draft a guard, if they get Mobley i'm gonna say somewhere random like Washington S&amp;T  Hart - NOLA"
John Collins. Fuck it gimme Taj Gibson. Literally anyone but lazy KLove.
John Collins this offseason might get a max on numbers similar to that
Trae Young and John Collins time since they need a PG and PF
But in this scenario the Spurs wouldn‚Äôt think John Collins is worth the max. John Collins still needs to accept the offer too.

"Depends on free agency and health. If we let DeMar walk and sign John Collins and stay healthy, I expect us to be better next season."
Me too. So which one of these players do we throw a bunch of cash to? John Collins come on down
John Collins
"That's what people don't get(lol for the most part people around here are dumb). Lebron is about to cash in on Space Jam 2 and he is going to sell off his equity shares at 750 million. Lebron can easily say to Jeanie Buss 'Hey, here's 100 million. Go get me Lonzo, Lowrly, Noel, and John Collins. Pay men back with interest'. It's that simple."
"Oh, absolutely. I‚Äôm not trying to be critical of what he accomplished. He still would have had to work very hard. It‚Äôs [suggested](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2602986-players-say-the-nfl-has-an-hgh-problem-even-if-peyton-manning-isnt-part-of-it) 10-40 percent of the NFL uses HGH.  My point is, for better or worse, the NBA is more strict with testing. John Collins was suspended for a growth hormone releasing peptide, Ayton was suspended for masking it, Chandler was suspended for using a GH peptide. These aren‚Äôt even synthetic exogenous hormones like actual HGH.  So, to point to Adrian Peterson and suggest that Kawhi could be back to his MVP-caliber self in 9 months is disingenuous. Recent NBA injuries and recovery protocols suggest he‚Äôll take more than a year if he wants to do what‚Äôs best for his knees."
"Each team is only eligible to extend &amp; keep one player's contract with 5 years deal.     John Collins is eligible for 5 years deal, but I do believe Hawks is gonna to keep this slot for Trae Young     Some explanations &amp; exception: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA\_salary\_cap#Designated\_Player"
So is John Collins eligible for a 5 year deal from Atlanta? I don‚Äôt hear any talks about that
"Bagley on his own doesn't have a lot of trade value but if you attach FRPs I'm sure teams would give up decent value, not an All-Star but maybe a guy 1 or 2 tiers below that. He's a risk because of his injuries, court awareness/defense, and possibly some personality concerns but he's also a relative unknown that has athletic potential that might just need better coaching and system to unlock. Like he could be John Collins on a better team but he could just as easily end up continuing to be a glorified Kenneth Faried. If you add FRPs to that I feel like it mitigates some of the risk while enhancing the potential upside."
"Late but the way the roster was constructed last season they DESPERATELY need a stretch 4! Early on Pop decided to glue Trey Lyles to the bench which left Lamarcus, Eubanks and a young player named Luka Samanic who was never going to get decent minutes.   So Lamarcus gets bought out,Luka spends a lot of time in the G league, and Lyles is riding the bench. They signed Gorgui Dieng to mitigate our lack of depth but it was still a glaring hole on our roster.  So now that the Spurs have a lot of cap space to work with I can see why some feel John Collins may be that piece the Spurs need. He spaces the floor and can put up some good numbers and he‚Äôs still really young. Add in their semi high draft pick I can see a guy like Kai Jones (hopefully) falling to the Spurs, however another glaring issue for the Spurs is their atrocious 3pt shooting so they just may opt for a pure shooter in the draft"
I can‚Äôt seem them throwing max money at John Collins. They want flexibility unless it‚Äôs a superstar
"John Collins has averaged 16.6ppg, 8.4rpg, 1bpg on 56/35/83% shooting over four seasons and he‚Äôs made $11mil for his efforts. Max him out‚Ä¶ Joe Ingles is 33yrs old, has lesser stats and will make $14mil this season alone."
"I meant in terms of his place in the team. John Collins has SOO much potential, that, if he realizes, going to a team with subpar dev coaches could not fully realize for him his max potential.   Same goes with Siakam, atleast the Raptors Organization can show their recent development of players, from rags to riches.   Now take a really good player in Collins and thrust him into a system like that, or Phoenix, or Boston. He‚Äôll be an All Star every year. Mark my words. Or just use the remind me bot in 4/5 years This offseason will make or break his career. Will be become an elite PF? Or just another roleplayer?"
I feel bad for whoever gives John Collins a max
Try to get John Collins and maybe trade for Ben Simmons. S&amp;T with Demar as well depending on what you guys can get back.
don't settle for less john collins is where it really is
John Collins in a sign and trade
Is John Collins not expected to go back to the hawks? I can‚Äôt imagine they don‚Äôt make him a competitive offer
"John Collins would demand 30 mil, Spurs would need him, bo not for that price."
"I know OP said 15, but I'm picking 12 because that's what we actually send to the Olympics/FIBA events.  Starters: Steph Klay KD LeBron AD  Bench: Kyrie Harden Butler Kawhi Tatum Draymond Bam  And since that's basically the 2016 Rio roster with a few minor changes, here's one for Paris 2024 just for fun.  Starters: Trae Booker Jaylen Brown Tatum AD  Bench: Ja Fox Spida Ingram Zion Bam ...and the wild card. I'm fairly certain that Ayton still has the option to apply for a US passport and play for Team USA (if he chooses). In that case he becomes the starter over an aging AD. Otherwise that last spot could go to MPJ if they need a stretch big to play next to Zion, Jarrett Allen for another rim protector, or maybe even John Collins."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don‚Äôt pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot.

&gt; John Collins  dang didn't realize he's a FA - he was great in the playoffs imo
"John Collins is  far superior offensive player to KMart.  Love KMart.  Though even if KMart had Jon Collins offensive game, the Nets still lose to the Lakers and Spurs."
"Obi Toppin is actually more legit than people give him credit. He really only gets 8 minutes of playtime since he cant share the floor with Randle. The only real downside is his versatility IMO. He is a PF and nothing else.   He's still an amazing rim runner, lob threat, PnR man and can space the floor. Like a poor mans John Collins"
"Sexton to Knicks makes some sense. Wonder if Cavs could do a sign and trade. So maybe you get a third team involved.   I don't know how the Clippers get Lonzo based on their contracts and what Reggie Jackson is going to demand. Bulls seem to be the team that would land Lonzo.   If I'm John Collins and the Hawks don't resign you, I'd head to either San Antonio or Dallas."
"Didn‚Äôt even consider John Collins on the wolves. I doubt it‚Äôll happen, but that would be sick"
"&gt; Dallas, Miami, San Antonio, and Wolves are expected to show interest in John Collins  lmao. Trae would pull a Blake and barricade Collins in his house all night."
"&gt;Across the league, many believe Hawks forward/center John Collins increased his value as a maximum contract-caliber player during Atlanta‚Äôs run to the Eastern Conference finals. In 18 postseason games, Collins averaged 13.9 points, 8.7 rebounds and 35.7 percent 3-point shooting.  I like John Collins a lot and hope he'll back in Atlanta for a reasonable amount of money (and don't blame him for WANTING more), but I don't know how anybody could watch him in the playoffs and think he's a max-deal player."
"Ja Morant, Buddy, Ingram, Julius Randle, KAT. Bench of Trae, Zion, PJ Tucker, Lonzo, Miles Bridges, Marcus Smart, Duncan Rodinson, John Collins.   Literally took me a minute to name a better team. All young and healthy. Play makers, defenders/dogs, shooters, and rims runners. More dominant physically to beat up the world."
Please god offer Collins 20$mil so we can match. I love John but have fully accepted someone offering the max and him leaving but I think our FO would be happy af getting him for 20m
We couldn‚Äôt get Zion? John Collins would have been good too? Aaron Gordon? Just somebody who can crash the glass.
"No, but he made it over John Collins and Myles Turner, which was a massive mistake."
"Halliburton‚Äôs not a second man, he‚Äôs a third or really good fourth man on a winning team. They‚Äôre still looking for a second option on offense.   My thought is they should overpay for John Collins this off-season, he‚Äôd help them a lot and he‚Äôll get all the looks he wants"
"Overpay John Collins   Trade Bagley, Hield, 9th overall for Porzingis   Fox/Halliburton/Barnes/KP/Collins is a competitive lineup"

"If I were the Hawks, I would give him a look. Giving Trae a legit 2nd ball handler who can take over the offense and give him rest in game is huge. You can't rely on Bogdanovic due to injury and John Collins is just not good enough"
Oh wait I saw this episode before with John Collins
"The difference in tone between this and John Collins‚Äô article is pretty wild. Both meant to be hype pieces but while Portis is asking the fans to do it for the team, Collins was telling the fans the team would do it for them."
"He isn't the only player who shoots layups exclusively.      Some notable players he's more efficient than (by TS): John Collins, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, etc. Note that TS also accounts for the efficiency of 3s and FTs."
"i'd personally take Bam above like 20 guys on this list. And there's 0 shot im taking Anthony Edwards, Lamelo, John Collins, D'angelo Russell, CJ McCollum over Bam."
young players that are about to get paid their dues get shit on constantly on this sub for years. john collins and collin sexton are the victims this year  jamal murray and jaylen brown are also recent examples
young players that are about to get paid their dues get shit on constantly on this sub for years. john collins and collin sexton are the victims this year
"I like, but would modify: DeRozen (s&amp;t), Murray, and Lonnie (Spurs keep pick)  Spurs sign John Collins with capspace and build around those two."
So like if a player is amazing are they pretty much set to play in one city for 7 years before they move?   Like John Collins for instance he's a RFA. So Hawks have the opportunity to match all offers should they chose too.  So in that situation what choices does a star player have to leave?
John Collins with a handle
John Collins ATL
I can say that by the fact they had the best offense in the league when Luka was on the bench.  I can say that by stating the fact that of their five main starters that year Trae had the second most games played for his career. John Collins who was only in his third year had the most.     I am factually correct.  Thinking otherwise is plain idiotic.
"John Collins has still has the greatest summer league dunk of all time, and barely anyone has seen it. It‚Äôs straight though"
His floater/alley OOP to clint or John Collins was unstoppable
"They could all be prevented in general if the NBA allowed HGH  It helps strengthen your ligaments and is a really good measure for injury prevention and I'm pretty sure a lot of players in the NBA use it anyway. It's pretty much undetectable unless you conduct an isoform test on a player's blood hours after they've taken HGH. Clears out completely within a few hours. As long as you're using a natural form of HGH and not a synthetic growth hormone like peptide-2 (looking at you john collins), you literally can't get caught.  Studies showed that it only increases lean body mass when it is taken excessively. If you took that much HGH to where your body is using it to generate lean body mass, it would have severe side affects since your plates are already fused and you can't grow anymore. You'd die so nobody takes that risk anyway."
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?  Top (potential) free agents were:         Kawhi (doesn't count; wasn't leaving)   CP3 (old)   John Collins   Kyle Lowry (old)   Mike Conley   Demar DeRozan   Devonte Graham       Other names:   Duncan Robinson   Lonzo Ball   Danny Green"
"I think top 50 makes more sense. The 100th ranked player in the NFL was James Robinson, and the 50th ranked NBA player would probably be somebody like Siakam or John Collins, who I feel are worthy enough to deserve some sort of ranking.  Top 25 would not be interesting enough, because we wouldn't see very much change on a year to year basis. The top 15 players last year are almost all guaranteed to be top 20-25 players next year."
Ben‚Äôs attitude was obvious since day 1. Skipping summer workouts and never training. He hasn‚Äôt learned to shoot since his first year.   John Collins has improved dramatically since his first year. Horrible comparison
"From all I've heard, read, and seen, Larry preferred Carmelo Anthony. But the fact that Brown joined the team *after* so much of the staff had become smitten with Darko Milicic probably put him in a funny spot.   From what I gathered from Brown's comments on that 2019 podcast:  * Brown came aboard thinking Melo would be the pick  * Worked Darko out twice and Darko got winded (Brown not a fan). Melo did not work out for him.   * Director of International Scouting Tony Ronzone told Brown that prior to Brown's arrival Darko had a better workout than Kevin Garnett (this would have been the one at John Jay College in the ECF).   * Brown wanted to get Melo, Wade or Bosh to come in and workout against Darko but agents wouldn't go for that.   * He thought Darko looked like a Greek god and was very skilled but wasn't ready.   It's hard to tell how late in the game Larry still thought they were going with Carmelo, because he seems to readily acknowledge there were a number of folks who were in favor of Darko in the lead-up (""the people around me were convinced"" then the piece about Darko's better-than-KG workout).   If I had to guess, GM Joe Dumars, Director of International Scouting Tony Ronzone, and long-time coach and scout Will Robinson were all likely pro-Darko based upon their statements at the time (Robinson is the one who compared Darko favorably to Wilt's skill set at the same age).   Ronzone, in particular, was held in high esteem on account of being at the forefront of international scouting. He had inroads everywhere and had worked previously with the Mavericks (who, uncoincidentally, were also at the forefront of the international scouting game).   In Detroit, he paid dividends almost immediately. The Pistons were going to grab Jarron Collins in the second round (Jarron, not brother Jason) but Tony told them about Mehmet Okur. Then he was also responsible for Zeljko Rebraca, who had a moment in the sun in Detroit during that first Goin' to Work year then essentially had his career ended by an irregular heartbeat. Carlos Delfino was another Ronzone find.   So it was with that Dumars recounted in 2004, ""This was two years ago that we drafted Mehmet Okur and it was two years ago that he told me that there were some great young kids coming out of Europe. He said there's a kid over there 16 and I'd draft him right now. He said Darko Milicic. He said remember that name.   ""He said, 'Joe, we won't have a chance to get this kid because he'll be a top five pick.' I said we might have a chance, we've got that Memphis pick sitting out there, if we ever got lucky. He said, 'If we ever got that lucky we'd be on cloud nine.' Lo and behold two years later what happens? The ball pops up with the second pick and we get Darko.""   My guess is that Joe, Tony, and company thought it was fate. That everything had perfectly aligned and with a sort of a free shot (since they didn't need an immediate contributor, as much as Brown would have wanted one), Darko was going to be their guy."
"The John Squad isn‚Äôt bad, John Havlicek, John Stockton, John Wall, John Starks, John Collins. Just missing a center and they‚Äôd be great."
"John  Stockton, Wall, Havlicek, Collins, Issac"
"Fully deserved after last season. If John Collins can get that much money, scary terry deserves it too"
Ben Simmons is a bum. He‚Äôs weak minded.  John Collins has the mentality to succeed
John Collins is 23. I would say it‚Äôs unlikely he never takes another step.
John Collins
John Collins averaged 20/10 once: in 2020 in 41 games. He averaged 18/7 this year lol.
That‚Äôs how I feel about the John Collins contract as a hawks fan
"That‚Äôs a lot of money, good for him but I am shocked that he is getting just 1 mill per year less than a player like John Collins"
Paul got over 20 twice in his career in total. And both times he did it by being way less efficient than Nash. You have this weird attachment to 20p. John Collins scored 20p a game last season is he also an all time great scorer?   Curry took more shots in his rookie season than Nash has taken during any season of his career. If your view of a great scorer is someone who just guns than okay.

"So how does John Collins get a 5 year 125 million, which is much less than the available ‚Äúmax‚Äù extension to him, but Smart is eligible for his ‚Äúmax‚Äù at 4 year 77.1 mil?  What accolades did John Collins achieve that Smart hasn‚Äôt?"
"yah, they paid him star money but dude is a third option. So glad the Hawks didn't go overboard with John Collins like the sixers did with Tobi. Clearly Simmons is the main problem, but pushing 40 aav for what Tobi brings is a great way to close your window a little bit more"
John Collins
"There‚Äôs a difference between Denver giving him a 5 year max with a player option on the end, and just matching a 4 year max from another team. There‚Äôs also no guarantee that he‚Äôll get a 4 year max from someone else, since everyone would expect the Nuggets to match that.   Free agency moves so fast now that maxing a RFA is a huge gamble. Denver will just wait 3 days (or is it 2 days?) to match and the team with max cap space will be shit out of luck.   We saw it with John Collins, where he wanted a max but no team out there even gave him an offer sheet. There‚Äôs always the risk that the player takes the QO, but with MPJ‚Äôs injury history that‚Äôs a massive risk on his part."
Just John Collins for the Hawks
"I feel like he's on track to be a pretty significantly higher caliber of player than John Collins, which makes hesitating on maxing him hard for me to understand. He's 6'10 and a career 44% 3-point shooter, and we've seen that he's stable the in playoff too, career 39% there.    His career TS is 64.9%, and 60.3% in the playoffs.   If they see him as a John Collins type of player, it feels like they're hard undervaluing him."
Probably similar to the John Collins situation. They dont want to pay him max and is just waiting it out. Maybe he will get a similar contract next year.
"Trae averaged 8.2 APG his rookie year with a big rotation of Dewayne Dedmond, Alex Len, 2nd year John Collins, and Omari Spellman. Averaged 9.3 APG his second year with a big rotation of Bruno Fernando, John Collins, Jabari Parker, Damien Jones, and Alex Len. He's a better passer than Luka. Luka is still a better overall player, but passing in particular Trae is better."
Yeah I didn't even think of the price tbh. Hawks may be trying to elevate their status in the NBA to legit contenders but it's not worth the price especially when you have to ask after the trade how much did this really improve our team. Ben on the hawks sounds fun but complicated as well. I think it'd be more centered around Bogdan Bogdanovic and Cam rather than John Collins though. I doubt Philly says yes anyway though and as a hawks fan I'm not even sure I'd do this.
John Collins
They need John Collins to keep developing and hope Reddish and Hunter can stay healthy and reach their defensive ceilings.   Hunter is the key piece IMO - he was one of their better players this year and has shown the ability to be a 1st Team Defense player within a couple years.
"Brogdan Luka Harris john collins Ayton  Bench: Drose, lu dort, ingles, Portis, olynik"
"Jerami Grant, Ayton, John Collins, Brogdon"
"I think John Collins is going to take a huge step forward after his solid playoff performance.  He is so young and has some great skills (rebounding, defense, and mid to long range shot making ability) to be a great PF."
"Hawks are being rewarded for their draft picks. Getting Hunter and Cam in the same draft is robbery lol. Preceded by Trae and John Collins. They deserve to have this window of potentially multiple deep playoff runs. If Cam stays fit i think Hawks are going to be really scary , he has had a stop start first couple of seasons."
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10.

Definitely not. The difficulty of Russ‚Äô passes is much harder due to the fact he doesn‚Äôt have a John Collins type player who can snag any oop within a solid 5 foot radius
"Unless you think Collins will be a bum after year 4 he only really made and extra $6 million by not signing the offer last summer. The only difference is he now has a player option on year 5 for 28 million (when the cap explodes) so unless he is a bum or injured it won't matter.   The current contract pays him 4 years 96 million for the first 4 years. The contract he refused last year was 4 years 90 million.  &gt;On the Hoop Collective Podcast (h/t Reddit.com), ESPN's Brian Windhorst said the Hawks offered Collins ""in excess of $90 million"" on an extension that was turned down because he ""was seeking something at or near the max and he stuck to his guns.""  Source: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2924174-hawks-rumors-john-collins-turned-down-90m-contract-extension-seeking-max-deal"
"* Kawhi refused to sign extend for less than a max coming off his rookie contract, and the Spurs tried to lowball him at first.  * Jimmy refused 4/40m with the Bulls, and signed for 5/92m instead.  * Greg Monroe took a risk taking the QO because he wanted to get out of Detroit. Reportedly refused a 5y/60m contract (he denies this was offered). Ended up signing a max contract @ 3/50m  * Tobias turned down 4y/80m and signed for 5y/180m  * Will Barton turned down 4y/42m and signed for 4y/53m  * Gary Trent Jr rejected 4y/54m and signed for 3y/54m  * John Collins turned down 4y/90m and signed for 5y/125m"
John Collins earned an xtra $45 million by not signing his offer sheet earlier.
"Like 3/4 months ago there was a Hawks fan deadass saying John Collins was just about as good as Tatum, just slightly worse at shooting 3s. Don‚Äôt think he was even low on Tatum just that high on Collins. Still a bit triggered."
Is it John Collins can really jump or he is just really tall or its angles? He was looking down into the hoop on his dunks.   PS: LBJs dunk is in no shape or way or form better than No. 10 dunk

He turned down 4/84 from the defending champions that happen to be the most famous basketball organization worldwide to go to the Celtics for 5.9 mill. How greedy and unrealistic can you be that you desire that much more money? It‚Äôs not like he was John Collins trying to get a max. 4/84 was already a massive overpay.

"No offense, but I find it interesting that Philly fans, ""get this bum outa here! He's trash!"" But also"" He's worth 4 1st round picks + young players + an all star!""  I do agree Ben in Minnesota will be fun, imagine the fast break possibilities, but I'm not sure he's the player to go all in on. Personally, I'd prefer a John Collins or Miles Turner type player, a low usage high defense type big man."
Most talented duo probably But Trae X John Collins has better chemistry
Brogdon - Jalen Brown - Tobias Harris - John Collins - Gobert
KAT is just a maxed out John Collins
Like John Collins then
"This dude actually just said he needs to be more effective off ball to allow John Collins to shine more. John Collins is a great player, but he has absolutely no handle or playmaking ability whatsoever.   Partnow is really grasping at straws to criticize Trae, and instead it just reveals how clueless he is about the players on our team. No way could anyone actually watch the Hawks and think, ‚ÄúAtlanta really needs to get the ball out of Trae‚Äôs hands and let JC run the offense‚Äù."
John Collins.
This is the salary he deserve (John Collins) funny how Hawks wasted their money.
"The issue is that if a team sees Sexton as a potential future all star, he‚Äôs very very likely to get a max. The way the league seems to go nowadays is that rookies who have shown all star POTENTIAL almost always get a rookie  max.   John Collins just got 25m, and imo there‚Äôs an argument to be made is that Sexton is at least on his level if not a bit better, so there‚Äôs a good chance he gets a max."
https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/john-collins-atlanta-hawks-nba-basketball-playoffs  John Collins' article sums up the team's energy last season really well. I think they just came in feeling like they had something to prove and were ready to tear someone's heart out on their home court if necessary.
Point is that Ben was shit in series.  But the blame goes deep and wide.  Seth defense.  Embiids turnovers.   Tobi missing layups.  Plural.   8-24 total in game 7 as our highest paid player and getting checked 1 on 1.   Dwight being borderline special in fouls killing momentum.   Morey for whiffing at the deadline and not giving Doc depth in the front court so George Hill had to check John Collins bc there was no one else.  All it took was one injury to hamstring rotation.  Doc pissing away 20+ leads twice.   Ben is top of list.  But everyone involved needs to eat a piece of that L.
"Aside from having much more responsibilities now, he can do much more with the ball, better at attacking off the dribble, better passer, much better defender, and a better creator for others.    Have you ever seen a team double John Collins?    Collins is more efficient, but that's also a product of a super easy shot distribution.  When your points are coming from corner 3s, lobs, and rolling, you will be much more efficient.    When Siakam played in a John Collins like roll, (18-19) he averaged 17/7/3 on 63 TS, while also playing at an extremely high level defensively."

John Collins can actually create his own offense tho
Why would Trae play off the ball to watch John Collins try and fail to create shots?
"Then follows it by saying   &gt; However, at this point, it‚Äôs probably best to cut my losses, take the L  and   &gt; Whether Young can ascend into Tier 2 will depend on a number of smaller improvements. Can he continue to refine his shot selection? Will he find ways to be slightly less of a defensive liability than his 755th place ranking (of 755!) in three-year dRAPM suggests he has been? Can he become a more effective player off the ball to allow the talents around him, such as Kevin Huerter and John Collins, to shine a little more? Having learned my lesson, I‚Äôm no longer betting against him being able to do so.  He's clearly turned around on Trae."
"Sucks for Dennis Schroder.  But he believed in himself,  gambled on himself, and lost. It happens a lot like with Demarcus Cousins and John Collins. Cousins  unfortunately got injured. Collins turned down a $90m contract before the season started and after a good season he signed a $125 m contract."
"Yeah, I think Boston has got to part ways with a few of those promising youngsters (who need to be somewhere getting playing time) and bring in a solid veteran with playoff experience. But I don‚Äôt know if you need a ‚Äútrue 4.‚Äù Most of the top 4‚Äôs today play a lot of perimeter ball, space the floor, shoot three‚Äôs, ect. Question: do you consider Durant, Williamson, Randle, Sabonis and John Collins ‚ÄúTrue 4‚Äôs‚Äù?"
We re-signed Trae and John Collins at the same time and then drafted Trae and John Collins at the same time shit happening like that probably has a phrase in a foreign language that I don't know of
"So, we have two John Collins now?"
"I mean he shoulda signed that immed. He does not seem to have a concept of his worth. He‚Äôs not going to get that kind of offer again.  He‚Äôs not worth Tim Hardaway, DWhite, Dejounte, John Collins Duncan Robinson money. That‚Äôs around what those dudes make. Hopefully w a solid season he can get 12-15m a yr over multiple years. A little bump up is Lowry, DeRozan Conley money.   He‚Äôs not close.  Feel bad for him and hope it was all his ego and not terrible agent advice, or else feel way more terrible for him."
"I don't see it. There's no one in his tier of players who has ever been paid more. Even when their team is up against the cap. Only 5 players got paid more this offseason, CP3, Lowry, Derozan, Conley, and John Collins. Him and his agent are incredibly mistaken if he thinks he's in that tier of players. Jarret Allen, Tim Hardaway Jr, Duncan Robinson, all got paid less and are probably more sought after than schroder. The clippers have their back against the cap wall and gave big contract extensions to Morris and Kennard last year and those are both ~15/year compared to Schroder's 21/year. There's just no comparison in the league."
But Steph isn‚Äôt really a facilitator like that so if we are saying that scoring and having gravity off ball is playmaking then Kevin Durant should easily be here and by that logic people that are good at setting screens and rolling and being a vertical threat should be consider playmakers as well. Such as John Collins because his screens creates separation for Trae and his ability to catch the lob opens up a play for Trae. As well as his ability to shoot the ball.
Lmfao.   The Hawks played the Heat in an important late season game last year missing 4 out of 5 starters (John Collins was the only starter that played) and beat them by double digits.   The Hawks were the 3rd most injured team in the league and that‚Äôs the only reason why the two teams had similar records.  There was a wide gap between a healthy hawks team and a healthy heat te last year and it‚Äôs larger than a Kyle Lowry and a PJ Tucker could fill.    On top of that the Hawks are even deeper this year than they were last year and most of their roster should improve because of how young they are.
Draft OG Anunoby and John Collins instead of Zach Collins.    Draft Giannis instead of CJ.
"In terms of in-game dunkers, I'm always fond of guys who aren't afraid to push the boundaries, put on a show, and hurt the rim. There's a lot of athletic freaks out there who just don't seem motivated to do anything special (tough to fault from a game perspective) but among the dudes I think are doing it right at the moment:   [Ja Morant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeBRMSwc8VY&amp;ab_channel=MemphisGrizzlies): He could be a super athletic basic dunker if he wanted but his willingness to do things like [add a two-hand windmill to a mid-game lob toss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrSq-z8TRyk&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights) is what makes him a special dunker to me.   [Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPeyxb8SVs&amp;ab_channel=NBA): Would make Kenyon Martin Sr. proud, and probably a bit jealous.   [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-GUJ0hJ4&amp;ab_channel=NBArtv): Some of the best tomahawks in the league.   [Derrick Jones Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E72NkHc-gSU&amp;ab_channel=SPProductions): Lost track of him this year and I didn't watch the full highlight clip but based on what I saw from him in Miami, I imagine he's still mostly worthy (I know there was an injury or two in there that may have had an effect).   [John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_H3hnqd9_E&amp;ab_channel=RookieProductions): Might be my favorite big man dunker at the moment."
"To be fair, LA is the market that gets players noise. I mean Josh Hart is arguably more popular than John Collins. Yes he stepped away a bit but I think the biggest factor is him being out of the spotlight."
"I was comparing Saddiq to his contemporaries not trying to criticize him.  I was thinking of players versatility like Kelly Oubre, Michael Porter Jr, Jason  Tatum. Jaylen Brown, Cameron Johnson,  Kawhi Leonard,  Paul George,  John Collins etc."
"Even if they didn't want Mitchell it was stupid to trade down for the grand prize of a 6 point 3 rebound big man when the player picked after was Bam followed by John Collins, Jarret Allen, and OG."
John Collins seemed to work well at the 4 last year. So did Bobby Portis
"At the beginning of the season before we fired LP I wanted the hawks to trade John Collins so we could get a top 7 pick and select Johnson, who knew we'd be able to keep John, get to the ECF, and select JJ anyway"
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
"2024 way too early Roster  PG - Morant, Lamelo Ball, Steph Curry/Trae Young  Wings - Ingram, B. Mitchell, Lavine, Tatum, Brown  Post - Williamson, Isiah Stewart, Michael Porter Jr/AD, John Collins  Note I'm only going with players who have played in a NBA game."
"PG: DFox, Trae, Ja  SG: Beal, Jaylen Brown, Booker  SF: Tatum, Lavine, LeVert  PF: Zion, John Collins, Randle  C: Bam, Jarret Allen, Robert Williams  Rookies that could make it: Cade, Mobley, Suggs  Coach: John Calipari?

Booker Tatum melo Zion Trae AD Deandre ayton or bam John Collins KD Lavine Cade Mobley
Maybe a decent one like John Collins or Tobias Harris?
"Ah yes. Zion going from an All Star to ??? Has there been precedent for that before?  Just looking at past winners, John Collins has the best chance if you base it off prior winners."
"You're getting a lot of troll responses, but the Olympic 3x3 was really fun to watch. It's difficult because of the qualification requirements, but if USA Basketball wanted to take the men's 3x3 as seriously as they take the women's 3x3 (and I think they should), then it's definitely possible. Ideally, you'd have one taller point guard (Dejounte is a good pick), and then 2 big wings who are good one-on-one defenders (Harrison Barnes, Mikal Bridges, and Kyle Anderson come to mind), and one mobile big as a roll man who can also guard on the perimeter on switches (John Collins definitely works here, as does someone like Mason Plumlee or Aaron Gordon)."
"Can't compare Lauri to KD. A better comp would be John Collins whose avearged 8 for his career and had a 20/10 season last year, tho he only played 41 games. Lauris been injured but never consistent."
"Oh yeah, 'just make a trade'.  Outside Dame, tell me what asset does Portland have that looks good enough that you'll be willing to give up Jimmy Butler for?  That's right, a 'splash trade' isn't happening.  CJ's not worth shit.  Reality is Portland is stuck in a bad spot.  Portland made the playoffs in 2016 and had cap space to sign a major All-Star caliber player.  Nobody came.  The only place to acquire players is through the draft.  But it turns out, if you're too good, you don't get lottery picks that turn into All-Stars.  Now, Portland did have opportunities to draft Mitchell (who Lillard wanted), OG, Bam, and John Collins.  They, instead, drafted two guys who are not even currently playing basketball."
ThAt Caruso is better than Derozan and Kanter is better than John Collins
He didn't do any talking to John Collins lately...
Giannis Middleton Jrue KD Harden Kyrie Trae Lebron AD Butler Tatum Steph Klay? Randle Beal Lillard Embiid Kawhi PG CP3 Booker Jokic Derozan? Luka Zion Jaylen Brown? Sabonis? Fox? Adebayo? Ayton? Donovan Mitchell John Collins? Jamal Murray? Zach Lavine? Lowry?   That‚Äôs 25 guys if you don‚Äôt include any of the question marks. 36 including question marks that I‚Äôm not sure are better but are close at this point in his career.
"Severe lack of John Collins in these lineups  That being said:  SGA, Murray, Bridges, Collins, Ayton"
Lonzo Ball - Jamal Murray - Jerami Grant - John Collins - Clint Capela.
"Yes, but werent you guys expecting to lose john Collins to free agency. If so, keeping him is a win in my books."
"nah his eyes are just a little weird is all, don't listen to those guys mirotic or  john collins"
"That sounds like a big difference between the total antics.  Especially if John Collins was still doing all the dirty work and producing.  Wanting to do more and more reasonsibility? Great.  I want a hungry young guy that  does that and gets on the grind, produces, and is still supportive and a positive locker room influence/professional."
"Wait.. John , Jarret and Johnathan are better picks than Lonzo??  This is just plainly and utterly wrong. MAYBE John Collins."
"Tatum went 3 and would have been 1 without the Philly trade down. Bam, Fox, Mitchell all went in the lottery. All four are varying degrees of franchise cornerstones now. All would have been better choices at 1 or 2. It also had John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Johnathan Isaac... Arguably better picks than Lonzo and definitely better than Fultz. That draft class was pretty solid.  I think it's just that even in really strong draft classes, the predraft consensus at the top is usually wrong."
"Just a thing Collins says. Short for ""Baptist"" cuz he's John the Baptist."
john collins?
I bought a shirt with John Collins dunking over Embiid. This team is dope
"Are there rules by trying to spell in the lowest number of players possible?

"I've always thought the Hawks were a dark-horse choice for any disgruntled star in the league. A ton of young talent and established vets.  John Collins, Gallo, Bogdan, Huerter, Reddish or even Capela if a C like KAT could be available. Mix and match those guys for salary. I believe the Hawks also own all of their picks moving forward. They can make an enticing offer"
"He‚Äôs also making half as much money as Simmons   You are incredibly overvaluing Simmons, we just saw John Collins box him out with one hand in game 7 of the second round. I don‚Äôt think playing with golden state is gonna change that. And it‚Äôs not like the sixers didn‚Äôt give him opportunities and didn‚Äôt have outside shooting.  Him being a facilitator on offense doesn‚Äôt mean much when you can just foul him either.  To me it‚Äôs pretty clear that this is what Simmons is and this is all he will be. And that player is not worth the sixers asking price.   Unless he fundamentally changes his outlook on who he can be as a player. (And given how he seems to respond to criticism it‚Äôs doubtful he ever will) he will never be better than he is right now."
"Yes okay scoring sure whatever But man whatever Hunter Man was the third option, and averaged 16 as well Has a more reliable post and pull up game (coming from a man who watches Hawks basketball, and sometimes watches og play) He would be easily averaging 20 if John is gone, but John does stay I see that for him as well, plus he is more reliable to create his own shot. You might think Trae is spoonfeeding him baskets, hell no, not even close. Pull ups and post ups and his push shot is his game, not just standing in the corner waiting for the ball Plus his defense is really underrated as well Imho I really do think Randle is overrated during that playoff run, but it's also because Hunter guarded him most of the time in the series, making him force up fadeaways, and tough stepbacks. Randle did score a lot during the regular season on us, but Collins guarded him a lot during that time as well, plus El Pee is the worst of all time  That said, Hunter is going to make that OG jump, even maybe with collins on the floor with a possible better TS than O.G  So you can say anything you want about O.G I respect your opinion, but please Hunter could do anything what O.G does even better"
John Collins disrespectfully disagrees
"Khris and Jrue are on completely different levels to Collins, Capela, and Bogi (the next best players on the hawks) and not to mention John and Capela are much worse players with Trae. Obviously the supporting cast was solid but while Giannis is on a completely different level to Trae without Giannis the bucks have a much better ability to sustain themselves."
"Shooting is absolutely an issue. You can't have a non-center that literally will not take a jumpshot in today's league. Especially in the playoffs. Maybe a bench player could survive for a few minutes but a starter that's going to play 35+ minutes? No way, it creates so many issues for an offense. John Collins was over 10 feet away from Ben when Ben had the ball on the perimeter, it was basically just like having an extra help defender on the court. His aggressiveness and confidence is definitely also a flaw, but we don't need to pretend that a point guard that refuses to shoot any jumpshots whatsoever isn't an issue."
John Collins?
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."

"yes. Trae Young === Steph Curry, Bogdonavic === Klay Thompson, and John Collins === Draymond Green. The Hawks have obviously figured out the NBA and will go 74-8 and leave LeOld James in the dust before signing Luka in 2025"
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
"But the Hawks have Clint Capela,De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, and John Collins. Also we know that Butler can be absolutely terrible, we saw that against the Bucks"
"&gt; You know what is a bit fresher in my memory than a regular season record in a pandemic year? Trae Young lobbing to John Collins off the backboard in a playoff game. Embarrassing.  That was against the Bucks, my dude.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEynghuXMP0&amp;ab_channel=BleacherReport  Good try on the memory thing, though"
They had a high seed because Bud was smoking crack with weird lineups on the bucks sideline and the Nets were diddling themselves during the regular season. You know what is a bit fresher in my memory than a regular season record in a pandemic year? Trae Young lobbing to John Collins off the backboard in a playoff game. Embarrassing.
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
"The way to game this question is to pick the highest rated All-Star that isn't a superstar and starters that are almost All-Stars.  If Paul George is allowed: Steph, PG13 (All-Star), KD, Morris and KAT (All-Star). Roleplayers would be probably be something like Lonzo, Duncan Robinson, RoCo and John Collins.  If PG13 is considered a superstar i would go for: Jrue, Robinson, KD, Giannis and KAT."
hmm then move CW to the bench and replace John Collins. put KAT starting at C. i still keep klay because he has good defense and plays off ball
"PG: Steph (Superstar)  SG: Klay (Allstar‚Ä¶PG is a superstar ya asshats don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôs making these lists alongside 2 other superstars)  SF: Lebron (Superstar)  PF: Draymond (Allstar)  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Tyrese Halliburton, SGA, Mikal Bridges, Jonathan Isaac, MPJ, Nerlens Noel, John Collins."
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
"Russ is the only one who seems like the odd man out there, Either Luka or Trae takes a hit from not being on-ball all the time there, but you do have the same Spain pick and roll/ double drag action the Hawks already run with Jayson Tatum instead of John Collins and Joel Embiid instead of Clint Capela which seems like a lethal action that they could run as frequently as they wanted."
"then this is where we differ because to me he hasn't shown anywhere near ""superstar potential"". I'd be shocked if he received that kind of offer. John Collins, a vastly superior and way more proven player at his position, didn't receive a max in RFA this summer. A max for JJJ would be along the lines of 5 years $160M, you cannot convince me JJJ is receiving that kind of money.  He has some very interesting qualities and some upside, but I wouldn't go a penny over 3/$60M right now on an extension, and even then I feel like that's more on potential than anything he's actually shown on the court. He's played a season and a half worth of games in his career and has been all over the place. There just isn't enough to go off of. Hopefully he can play a full season and reveal who he actually is as a player.  If JJJ and his agent don't want to ""fumble the bag"" I think they're going to have to come down from 4/100M.  If Memphis wants to offer him 4/$100M right now, by all means go ahead and good luck. i wouldn't."
Yeah it's just what we have to do. Teams like us require a shit ton of luck to make it to the top even if we do everything right. Same with the contract Atlanta gave to John Collins. It's clearly too much and you just have to hope he plays up to it
"Idk if Miami‚Äôs top end is better than Atlantas anymore tbh. Bam is better than John Collins, but I think Trae is better than Jimmy and the difference between Trae and Jimmy is the same as Bam and John imo."
"All pro golfers are on PEDs.  All pro hocker players are on PEDs.  It has nothing to do with race. Pro athletes with millions of dollars on the line are on PEDs.

"Throw in John Collins, Cam Reddish and some Frp's and I'll consider Capela"
"Yes being motivated to prove his haters wrong AND most importantly actually gonna be playing as a PF next to a real point guard as a roll guy more often will make him a better player.   Non shooting John Collins but a better defender, passer and transition player."
"Everyone on big contracts, because their poor value contract causes them to get shit on a lot.  1) Ben Simmons  2) John Wall  3) John Collins  4) Kristaps Porzingis  5) Tobias Harris  Other than the contract guys, De‚Äôaaron Fox and Christian Wood would(wood) be my takes."
John collins
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
Who would you pick as your 2nd option. Jaylen Brown or John Collins?
"there was (is?) a segment of Blazer fans who thought Zach Collins &gt; John Collins and would not listen to reason on the subject.  Also the Lakers &amp; Nets flair are pretty horrid, but then again so are lots of Celtics flair.  Really every team &amp; player has asshole fans/supporters, there are 4M r/nba subs and we skew heavily toward the nephew demo.  The only fanbase that doesn't get all up in arms are the Suns, but maybe that's just because I think Devin Booker is as good as they do..."
I think if he's the #2 next to Trae they won't win a championship. One of their wings needs to take the leap to #2 and let John Collins be #3.
"I interpret this list as players who you feel obligated to pay because you don‚Äôt want to lose them for nothing, rather than players on obviously bad contracts like John Wall.  G: Ben Simmons G: Chris Paul F: Demar Derozan F: John Collins C: Jonas Valenciunas"
"&gt;Hawks have done pretty decent with late first round picks. We got John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Jalen Johnson looks like he might be pretty good. If Detroit is rebuilding I think it would be wise to acquire as much firsts as possible and even if they don't want to draft late they can use multiple picks to move up in the draft. That's how we got De'andre Hunter. Jerami grant is good but Cade is so young. By the time he's ready to win I don't know how important grant will be to the team."
"I'm completely fine with what we paid Marcus. I feel like the Hawks are also probably fine with what they paid John Collins, there's a world where he's the perfect #2 option to Trae and we all feel silly for doubting him in a couple years"
I'd üíØ take John Collins over Lonzo Ball   Obviously I'm biased
John Collins &gt; Tobias Harris
luckily for y‚Äôall nobody wanted John Collins at least for the max they didn‚Äôt
First year of the rookie max extension vs the last year is like 28 vs 37. I don't get the 8% bird rights thing it bothers me. Sexton is this year's John Collins for sure. Not worth the max but could end up getting it with nobody really available if somebody wants to pay someone.
They did it with John collins and trae
Always felt like John Collins is underrated in this regard. He is a very handsome man
I‚Äôd say John Collins.
"Definitely, I think he would‚Äôve always been a bad defender but he was averaging 20 ppg at like 22 years old coming off an acl tear. If he wasn‚Äôt so bad at defense, he‚Äôd even get playing time today. I remember when John Collins was suspended for PEDs two seasons ago, Jabari filled in and averaged like 15 ppg."
"It's true. John Collins tried to chokeslam Embiid the game prior, they train together."
he'd be maxed easily.   Pretend John Collins was a borderline All-Defensive level defender
"So starting from inside out: He lacks the frame/physicality to create for himself in the interior. Doesn't really have a post game. He can certainly get up and finish above the rim if he gets a good lob, but it takes two to tango on that and the Magic don't really have that elite PG creator to generate easy lob points that someone like, say, John Collins has next to him. Okay, not a big deal. But then his handle isn't really developed yet, so he can't attack from the perimeter even on a closeout, so driving to the rim is going to be limited. Then his jump shot is developing, but still inconsistent, so even a two dribble pull up mid range game is something he probably won't be super successful with at least in the immediate future. Which leaves the three point shooting, which while promising (34% in the season before his injury) isn't something the Magic are going to look to go to super frequently. So what you're left with in terms of optimal offensive usage is transition and lob plays/finding him open in the interior, which is a pretty limited use case already before factoring in all the time he's missed and why he missed it (multiple knee injuries on a big man) so we don't know if he still has the bounce/quickness that allow him to get his bunny buckets.   Is that a comprehensive enough rationale?"
John Collins and rim protection
"The second best player on the Mavs comes off the bench for the Hawks last year. Who is better John Collins or Kristaps Porzigis. Bogdan or Tim Hardaway Jr. Josh Richardson, or Danilo Gallinari.  I said Assist% as they had virtually identical rates for the past 2 years and you know that. Its not trolling to say luka's the better playmaker, and Trae isn't top 10 its just the truth."
&gt;wtf kinda take is this.  Atleast fact check before you say things like this lol.   Stats from PBP:  Trae on:  John Collins: 25.7pts/100 65.1% TS  Clint Capela: 27.5pts/100 62.4% TS  Trae off:  John Collins: 21.8pts/100 51.7% TS  Clint Capela 18.2pts/100 39.4% TS
I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
The John Collins contract sounds about right. Probably with a PO
"Max might be too much, even if his next year goes well. His handle is extremely suspect, the defense is limited to impressive flashes, and the health concerns are very real.  No inside sources, but I reckon they're bargaining over a lower total number without health provisions and a higher number that puts a meaningful portion of the money behind health provisions. In my opinion, the best case scenario for Denver is to get him on a full five-year deal resembling John Collins' extension. I known he's shown more promise, but the health concerns with him very real, so a fully-guaranteed contract on that level might be compelling enough. For a comparison, I'd look to KP at the time he signed an extension: personally, I judge MPJ's risk as higher and his prospects lower. KP was an established high-level rim protector with reasonably quick fee, at least comparable as a play finisher, and shown more ability to create for himself on the ball.  That said, it's also worth noting that Denver were extremely quick to max Murray and Jokic. Obviously, Jokic went on to earn and exeed his money, but it was still a somewhat player-friendly contract at the time of the signing imo."
"Their bench looks very strong though, McCollum, John Collins, Ben Simmons? That‚Äôs a crazy good bench even if they‚Äôre only 8 deep. But I still don‚Äôt see them getting to the finals."
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
"John collins maybe. He not a really good defender, he can score but not shot create for him self. His rebounding is average, but overall i feel like he a product of Trae's playmaking."
"The two you mentioned + John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Josh Hart, Dillon Brooks, and Monte Morris are the other guys getting significant rotation play"
Not really John Collins will be an all star because hawks will be a very good team same with MPJ with nuggets.
"I think John Collins, MPJ and Barrett are all way too high"
"I would have OG, John Collins, jarrett Allen, Kuzma, Derrick white, and Dillon Brooks all on that list. In no particular order but they need to be acknowledged"
John Collins
"Yes for this year, and probably next summer you will keep the same core of players and see who fits and who doesn't. But after 2 seasons a lot of decisions are going to be made that break up the 7 guys you're talking about, that's not really my opinion that's just how the league works. I just looked this up for another comment, here's what today's rosters look like compared to the start of the 19/20 season for teams in the east. The stars like Embiid, Tatum, and Butler clearly stay on their teams. Here are your non star players still on the team from the 19/20 rosters  Sixers have Shake, Tobias, and Thybulle. Celtics have Grant Williams and Marcus Smart. Bucks have Lopez, Connaughton, and Thanasis. Heat have Robinson, Herro, and Haslem. Iggy counts but he left so it's still roster turnover. Go 3 seasons back and it's 2 rotation players AT MOST for all these teams.  Only looking at your cap sheet you simply cannot pay all your guys. A few will definitely still be around, but you're talking about 6 players here in Cam, DeAndre, Heuter, Capela, Okongwu, and Collins. In 2-3 years you'll probably only have 2, maybe 3 still around. This is all assuming you don't go out and try to trade for a star to pair with Trae. The sixers, Bucks, Heat, and Celtics already went through this, I know it feels like you can grow naturally but when Cam, and DeAndre are up for extensions in 2 years next to Trae and John Collins making 25+ you're just going to lose some due to FA or trades. I don't think I'm being unrealistic at all, I mean you straight can't afford those 7 players in 2 years."
"That‚Äôs fair, and I do think the role Cam fills is sort of what John Collins does already on offense, and Collins is leagues better on defense. So I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a starter on the Hawks, but he should be a starter in the next couple years for any almost team if he keeps getting minutes.   The issue really is that Atlanta has too many good players, which is a first time saying that."
John Collins
"Trae young, capela, John Collins, Brogdan, jimmy butler, bam, holiday, pascal, Hayward, Lowry, kemba  Literally all those guys would be better players. You must be mental to think he had a real chance if not for other factors."
Kinda like when Draymond said he‚Äôs one of the best defenders ever and the very next game John Collins puts his career high on him?
"Eh. Probably an overpay purely on the numbers, 23mil for just a rim roller and paint protector is pretty bad on paper. But for the Hawks, Capela is worth the money covering their backline, as they have John Collins next to him. And 2 years is a good duration, for both sides. Capela gets his leverage, and the Hawks cash in on Capelas prime without sacrificing future cap space.   I'd be interest to see how the contract situation lines up with Trae Young's extension deadline."
" But this isn‚Äôt even business. The best situation for Simmons isn‚Äôt even one of the California teams.   By pure playing style, and where he can be effective there‚Äôs a bunch of other places where he‚Äôs a better fit. Possible Portland alongside Dame. Maybe Atlanta since they want to get off of John Collins? Houston if he wants to pair up with Green and Wood?"
"&gt;  &gt; Sources: Ben Simmons tells team brass he no longer wants to be a Sixer and does not intend to report to training camp &gt;  &gt; Keith Pompey August 31, 2021 &gt;  &gt; Ben Simmons let it be known that he wants out. &gt;  &gt; In a meeting with the 76ers last week in Los Angeles, Simmons told team co-managing partner Josh Harris, president of basketball operations Daryl Morey, general manager Elton Brand and coach Doc Rivers that he no longer wants to remain a Sixer, according to multiple sources. &gt;  &gt; Sources said the three-time All-Star also does not intend to report to training camp. &gt;  &gt; For the second time since December, the Sixers are unsuccessfully trying to trade Simmons, whose trade value has diminished. At the beginning of this past season, they tried to send him to the Houston Rockets in exchange for James Harden. The Rockets ultimately traded Harden to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 11. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers are having a tough time finding a team to meet their lofty trade demands. &gt;  &gt; The organization does not want to trade Simmons for less than what it believes is fair market value. The four told Simmons they wanted him to report to the start of training camp on Sept. 28 and be a part of the team. &gt;  &gt; The source said, however, the Sixers‚Äô inability to get fair market value isn‚Äôt Simmons‚Äô fault. &gt;  &gt; Another source said there‚Äôs no shortage of teams still interested, but the problem is Morey is demanding a king‚Äôs ransom. &gt;  &gt; Simmons is fully aware the Sixers can fine him for holding out and failing to show up to training camp. But a source said money will not play a role in the decision-making for Simmons, who has four years and $147 million remaining on his deal. &gt;  &gt; Plus, fining Simmons could strain the Sixers‚Äô relationship with his super agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. Paul has a who‚Äôs who of clients ‚Äî players the Sixers might be interested in pursuing down the road in free agency. &gt;  &gt; When asked specifically whether he thought Simmons would come back at all, a source responded ‚Äúno,‚Äù resolutely. &gt;  &gt; None of this should come as a surprise. &gt;  &gt; As The Inquirer noted on July 26, if Simmons really wants out, he could opt to be disruptive or not show up for training camp. The tactic has worked for many elite professional athletes across sports who want to be traded. &gt;  &gt; On Aug. 9, ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins said Simmons is willing to hold out of training camp as long as it takes to get traded. &gt;  &gt; Time will tell if the 25-year-old reports and/or if the team avoids what is bound to be a circus-like atmosphere by trading him in the weeks leading up to camp. &gt;  &gt; The belief around the league is the Sixers have been holding out for six-time All-NBA point guard Damian Lillard to request a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. But Lillard said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving [Portland] ‚Äî not right now at least‚Äù on Wednesday during an Instagram Live stream. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers‚Äô best consolation could be circling back to the Blazers for a potential deal involving shooting guard CJ McCollum before the start of training camp. That trade would make sense for both teams. &gt;  &gt; In addition to fulfilling needs, the players have similar salaries. Simmons will make $33 million next season, while McCollum will receive $30.8 million. &gt;  &gt; The problem is both teams might think they should get more in return. &gt;  &gt; McCollum, 29, has averaged 18.9 points while shooting 38.9% on 3-pointers in 528 career games with 431 starts. However, the eight-year veteran out of Lehigh is not an All-Star after years of playing in the tough Western Conference. &gt;  &gt; Even still, he could be the best option and a good pickup right before training camp with all things considered. &gt;  &gt; League sources believe the Sixers will have a tough time getting what they perceive as fair market value under the circumstances. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúThink about three months ago when the Sixers are willing to give up Ben Simmons. You are like, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs see what we have to do to get him,‚Äô‚Äù said a Western Conference executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúNow, the difference is Ben Simmons says he refuses to play for the Sixers. He wants to go to three California teams. There‚Äôs so much bad blood between him and the team.‚Äù &gt;  &gt; The executive said teams are not willing to give in to the Sixers‚Äô steep asking price knowing they have to move Simmons. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúThe kid said he‚Äôs not going back,‚Äù the executive said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving you what you‚Äôre demanding. They really messed this up.‚Äù &gt;  &gt; A source believes the devaluing of Simmons began with Rivers‚Äô postgame comments following the Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals on June 20. &gt;  &gt; That‚Äôs when the coach, who has been one of Simmons‚Äô biggest supporters and defenders, was asked by The Inquirer‚Äôs David Murphy if the standout is still capable of being a point guard on a championship-caliber team. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the answer to that right now,‚Äù Rivers responded on a night when Simmons finished with five points, 13 assists, eight rebounds and was sidelined the final 40 seconds of the 103-96 loss. &gt;  &gt; He attempted just four shots, making two. For the fourth straight game, Simmons did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter. He played timid, appearing fearful to go to the foul line. &gt;  &gt; That became apparent with 3 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and the Sixers trailing, 88-86. He drove to the basket past Danilo Gallinari, but passed up an open dunk underneath the basket, dishing the ball to Matisse Thybulle, who was fouled by John Collins. Thybulle made one of two free throws. &gt;  &gt; The day after wavering, Rivers did say that Simmons is salvageable. He said the Sixers would put together the right type of offseason workout plan to help correct Simmons‚Äô shooting deficiencies. But a source said Simmons has not participated in a Sixers offseason workout plan. &gt;  &gt; The source believes it will be tough for Simmons to have a working relationship with the team moving forward. At the same time, the team isn‚Äôt trying to let their multifaceted player go for little in return. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers would definitely have a lot of holes to fill by getting rid of Simmons. &gt;  &gt; In addition to being the point guard, Simmons is a two-time NBA All-Defensive player, a third-team All-NBA selection, a small-ball center and reserve power forward. &gt;  &gt; Can one envision Simmons returning to the Sixers for two months just to raise his trade value? And with all the heat he‚Äôll likely receive from Sixers fans, he might benefit from a change of scenery."
&gt;14	Michael Porter Jr.	Closest Comp John Collins (2021)  &gt;16	Trae Young  So is he saying that Trae Young's projected 7 year value is lower than John Collins's projected 7 year value a year ago?
John Collins comes over to help as well. Maybe Trae doesn‚Äôt take an aggressive step out of help position for practically no reason?
"Even at John Collins money ($25m/year), Simmons is great value"
Trae Young and John Collins are best friends.
"&gt; They had max slot and there were some young, reclamation projects out there  Like who lol? Lauri Markkanen was basically the only one besides Zach Collins who we signed. And given that the cavs gave up a first to get Markkanen, we would've lost out on a first if we got him plus Thad Young who we are also trying to flip for another asset.  John Collins is basically the only other guy that was available and to get him we wouldn't have been able to sign and trade DeMar and we would have had to give him a max."
john collins?!?
"Well... I'm a Raptors fan and Pistons fan.   With regard to the Raptors, I'd have to say there haven't really been 'dark days.'  Nothing like what the Kings are going through of the Clippers have gone through, or even the Warriors.   At first, it was exciting just to get a team. We got the ROY our first year. We got some great and entertaining talent early on (McGrady, Camby, and Carter).  Had some playoff runs with Carter, he left in the worst way possible, but we picked up Chris Bosh shortly there after.   Had some more playoff appearances. Lost Bosh, and then started toward building what eventually led to a championship.   The Pistons are likely in their darkest days since the 70s.   We build a contender through the 80s, getting deeper and deeper in the playoffs each year before winning back-to-back.   Had a rebuild that started out well. First got to watch Rodman tear it up with rebounds, lost him in a trade, then drafted Allan Houston. Lost him but got Grant Hill, who was on his way to becoming the best all-around player in the league.   Lost him, but got Big Ben in return.   Got to watch amazing rebounding and defensive performances, and the pieces slowly came together. Tore up the league, beat the Lakers (AGAIN) to win a title back-to-back finals, then eventually traded Billups and everything went down hill.   And since then, it has been almost 15 years since we won a playoff series.   Sure... we've had some entertaining talent along the way. A year of Blake. Some nice rebounding seasons out of Drummond. A sweet old school post player in Monroe. But horrible signings that looked promising (even if questionable) that didn't pan out (Josh Smith) and a bad trade that was the result of mandates from new management (Jennings).   And the draft? We passed up on Klay for Brandon Knight? FUCK!!! I was pissed THAT NIGHT!! And have grown more pissed since, watching what Klay turned into.   We got Greg Monroe, who looked great, but we passed up on Hayward and Paul George in the process.   Then we got KCP over McCollum.   Stanley Johnson? Over Booker, Oubre, and Myles Turner? I mean... it was like shooting fish in a barrel that draft, and we still missed.   Got Luke Kennard ONE PICK before Donavan Mitchell and a few ahead of John Collins.   The team has just drafted SO poorly over the last 15 years."
"Idk Tatum, Fox, Mitchell, Bam, OG, and maybe John Collins and  Jarett Allen are all better players in my eyes.  Id put zo in the top 10 players in the class though for sure"
"If Ben Simmons was a low post threat sure, but too bad he‚Äôs not one at all ‚Ä¶.if u wanted to see John Collins help off Simmons (who proved to be a threat not worth covering) and double Embiid every play just say that"
And a dive right into John Collins knee

"You can have John Collins when you pry him from my cold, dead hands"
John Collins is way more athletic than domickey wilkins
lol Celtics fans thought they were getting John Collins in a sign and trade for Hayward when the hawks could‚Äôve just signed him outright.
lmao i remember when y'all thought he as better than John Collins. And yes it was a majority opinion back then
This is part of the problem with Simmons though. Because he offers no spacing John Collins had an easier time contesting here  And if you go back and watch a lot of the 76ers offensive struggles throughout the playoff years you see the same thing. Simmons clogging the lane  He has to be benched in these moments
"MVP: Trae Young  All NBA first team: Trae Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Hurter, John Collins, and Clint Capela"
John Collins the best of the bunch here.
"Miles Bridges, John Collins"
"John ""The Baptist"" Collins is a very good nickname."
"Lemon Peppa Lou (Williams), Red Velvet (Kevin Huerter), Ice Trae, John The Baptist (Collins)   Can you guess i‚Äôm a Hawks fan? Lol"
Sixers. Trae is amazing and John Collins is a stud but that Sixers team is way more talented than the Hawks. Unfortunately Sixers have choke rivers. Mitchell was injured the whole series. Conley pretty much missed the entire series as well.
"Two things I know for sure about current front office - they are patient and persistent. If they want a player, they will try their best to get him. It happened with Dlo, endless rumors about John Collins until he signed the extension, Ben Simmons situation now. Wolves already decided what is the right price for Simmons and are waiting what happens. If the difference in their price is one decent young player like Naz or Bolmaro, or pick swap, or couple second rounders - so be it, they will be ready to change the offer. However, if Ben Simmons is going to cost McDaniels or even Edwards? I personally don‚Äôt think it is worth it, probably Rosas thinks the same.   Regarding your question about couple first rounders - yes, I think they are ready to pay this price for the player who can immediately contribute.   I know it is common here to trash Timberwolves, but lineup Dlo-Edwards-McDaniels-Simmons-Towns should be in top-6 right away with a hope of internal growth and development."
"John Collins gets picked, if only to be traded.  He would def get picked, he‚Äôs not on a max deal even."
**John Collins with that smoke**
"John Collins attempted a single 3 in two years at Wake Forest (it was a chuck). He‚Äôs gradually improved in the NBA and is now averaging more than 3attempts/game at 40% shooting over the past two seasons. He‚Äôs not a sniper or anything, but since he‚Äôs such a roll threat he gets left wide open at the top of the key all the time as his defender covers the paint, and he can make those consistently now."
"The way he‚Äôs playing right now hunter will get John collins money. Which is good, just not a max."
"What does ""pack it up"" mean?  I think there's a tendency especially in the analytics side to think that teams are either rushing toward contention, rebuild, or mediocrity and sometimes fail to acknowledge incremental improvement is possible.  I think some of the teams on that list have gotten a little stale, like the Pacers, and could stand to shuffle the deck by dealing either Turner or Sabonis but that doesn't necessarily portend to an entire rebuild. But it should always be remembered that guys like Rudy Gobert, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and John Collins were taken outside of the lottery, so its not like those teams couldn't just try to continuously gain talent.  And some of those teams are in smaller markets which may not have the stomach to willingly break up an alright team and start from the absolute beginning again"
We had to deal with it every game last season for John Collins and it was awful
John Collins is going to be an All-Star this year.

"Definitely agree, no way he's worth the 5/175 but the other contract would put him around 27.5 AAV which is right around John Collins, Julius Randle, and Jaren Jackson Jr, so that is somewhat more reasonable."
"Absolutely more egregious trades, but the Nuggets trading Nurkic and a 1st for Plumlee was bizarre. Nurkic was playing his way out of Denver, but totally bizarre they needed to include a 1st rounder to acquire an inferior player to whom they immediately had to pay a ton of money.  It was justified because Connolly said the team had too many firsts, which isn‚Äôt unreasonable, but then in the subsequent 2017 draft they traded BACK from 13 (missing Mitchell obviously but less discussed is how good John Collins would‚Äôve been next to Jokic), which only made the deal make less sense.  However, they were only in that positon cause they dealt nearly-out-of-the league Afflalo to the Blazers for Will Barton and a 1st. Steal."

"Idk dude. I love trae young. But I think you‚Äôre overlooking how fucking stacked that roster is. Cappella is way better than Dwight Powell. Bogdonovic is way better than Hardaway Jr. John Collins is probably better than Porzingis at this point. Huerter, Hunter, Reddish feels way more reliable and useful than finney-smith, Brunson, and Bullock.  Luka‚Äôs on/off last year are similar. With him on the floor, the Mavericks had an offensive rating of 118.5, the best offense in the league ahead of Utah‚Äôs 118.4 last year (and one of the all time greatest). Off the floor the Mavericks slipped to bottom 5 (~110.1).  Given his size and ability to post up, I just trust him a little more than trae to carry a team over the finish line in the last 2 minutes of crazy intense playoff games. Love em both. I just naturally have to give the edge to the guy who‚Äôs size let‚Äôs him play and win in a myriad of ways."
"* Cam has looked good 3 games in.  * Dieng was a great signing. * Team defense looks good. * John Collins has improved his defense even more. * Offense hasn't clicked yet, but I'm optimistic."
"Embiid went at collins with dirty shit a LOT in the playoffs. The knee thing was particularly egregious, especially because he tries to throw john down after diving into his knee.  [Here's another example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AV_Y75sV2w) also from the playoffs. Embiid elbows collins in the face, lands on him on purpose, gets called for the offensive foul and then tries to fight JC. Of course, we all know the series ended like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yb4ULeQ76w), so john got the last laugh."

"It certainly was, because Capela wasn‚Äôt going to play until the following season, when he would have to get paid, and Westbrook and Harden would be making a massive amount. Tilman Fertita did not have a stable enough income to purchase the team. It was pretty widely reported that he had to take out massive leans on some of his casinos in order to keep up with the costs at first. Every move we made, starting with the Capela trade, shed salary. Capela was what made our offense efficient, because we had one of the league‚Äôs best pick and roll threats, and he was one of the league‚Äôs best defensive bigs. Last year he led the league in rebounds per game nearly all season, and that‚Äôs while he played next to an elite rebounder in John Collins as well.  It was about short term monetary value, and it fucked the team up for likely a few more seasons at that, and it led to Harden leaving. Yes, Covington was amazing for us, but we were asking him to play center. It clearly wasn‚Äôt an upgrade at that position, and that‚Äôs not a knock on Covington, that‚Äôs a knock on Fertita and Morey thinking we should get rid of the guy that was the reason our defense could switch everything."
John Collins gets shirts with pictures of his posters printed on them I believe.

That's a really stupid way of ranking players."

"Luka still getting good looks off. If you want to see lockdown look what John Collins did to tingus pingus, he sonned him."
"If it makes you feel any better, I wish we would have picked John Collins over TJ leaf lmao"
"I‚Äôve watched just 3 games entirely (GSW - LAL, MIL - BKN and DAL - ATL).   And out of them, I‚Äôve gotta say that the Hawks really impressed me. In particular Hunter, he was amazing on the defensive end. Reddish is a great guy to have off the bench. He was a piece of the Luka - Trae trade, and the Hawks FO picked correctly. Lastly John Collins, he‚Äôs a bucket (and also a fun guy) and I feel like he will live up to that contract, which got criticized by many. Oh yeah and Capela was as usual great, even while playing on minutes restriction. Glad to have him on my fantasy team lol."
"Idk what basketball ur watching dawg i dislike the hawks fanbase A LOT but i can appreciate that Trae is one of the most fun players in the league, their wings are amazing and their lob threats are incredibly energetic, especially John Collins, so yeah, hawks are good, might be great."
"Besides Pat Williams, your starting lineup is weak defensively. The Hawks have two players starting who can make all defensive team. Then John Collins who isn't shabby himself. Oh and Cam reddish and Onyeka on the bench. Thats just defensively. Your starting line up is pretty good but im talking about the entire team."
&gt;John collins and capella aren't beasts.  üß¢
They micced John Collins up tonight and he just seems like a great guy tbqh. He even complimented Cam on the sidelines like he was a decade older than him üòÖ it was cute
John collins and capella aren't beasts. We struggle against big centers.
This.  Porzingis doesn‚Äôt have the strength to post up most F/C‚Äôs even smaller ones like John Collins.

John Collins is a national treasure
And John Collins is our best defender so all 4 of them on the floor is insane
"Tbf the Hawks are very well equipped to give him problems with Hunter and Reddish both being great defenders and then having Capela on the inside. It's hard to get into a rhythm against that, especially with John Collins having a great defensive night as well"
holy fuck john collins
I want to fuck John Collins
Is it gonna be Game 1 Trae or John ‚ÄúRoutinely fucks up the Mavs‚Äù Collins with the big game tonight?
I‚Äôm terrified of John Collins.
"Yall remember back in February when Carlisle was having people double Trae the entire length of the court, basically daring any other Hawk to beat us, and John Collins had like 35, and but Trae only had 21, and we won? That was a weird-ass game"
"Honestly, I'm Hawks a fan. üòè  We already showed them who was who and what was what last year. üòÅ  From Trae doing whatever he wanted, To John Collins Baptizing Embid (twice), Ben wasn't the reason they lost and until Ben leaves they'll never address the real problem."
I didn't realize John Collins hit 40% last year
"Damn. I was gonna say that seems cherry picked as fuck, but even if you drop it down to 25 points it's still just all-time greats and top players.   Even dropping it to 20 points basically does nothing, besides adding the Suns year Dragic broke out into a legit PG and John Collins last year."
John Collins or Deandre Hunter
"It's amazing how polarizing Ayton has become among Suns fans. If you say he's not a max, you're immediately accused of calling him worthless. He's not Trae Young money, he's more John Collins money. But hey, if he can prove all of us wrong this season, heck, give him 5 year max!"
"It really, really sucks. No one remembers how good this guy looked in his rookie year, his post game was consistent, his face up game was nice with a mid range shot, and he seemed to move better on defense and on the boards IMO. Averaged 19 and 9 in 27 minutes down the stretch in 19 games after the all star break. Outplayed John Collins to steal a FIFA team spot (later turned the spot down!)   He was clearly flawed, he moved well but still needed to get better at rotating on defense. He needed to improve his off ball movement and ball movement habits. Those are non-issues with most guys that showed what he showed his rookie year, because most rookies at his size have those type of issues that can get cleaned up with more games and experience. But the injuries just ramped up and stayed consistent. He has improved slightly in some areas but those flaws are still prevalent, which is a lot less promising year 4. And at that, he hasn‚Äôt been able to show those flashes that he showed as a rookie on as much of a consistent basis at all because of those injuries. Missing that crucial year 2, only playing 14 games was absolutely crucial. I really hope he gets to a good destination with lots of opportunities so that he can salvage some of that untapped potential, because it‚Äôs a shame to see it get held back so much. Please OKC or Detroit pick up the phones"
"I mean there kinda is. If he hits the 3 they win the series‚Ä¶ lol. And the suns proved they had absolutely no big(man) defense with the way Giannis dominated. Now imagine that level of board crashing but shooting 50-40-90. It would‚Äôve ended the same way. #Edit: I realized you said ECF. John Collins isn‚Äôt stopping KD bro if it took PJ, jrue and Giannis to hold him to 35."
Needs to put it on a t-shirt like he‚Äôs John Collins.
John Collins is the counter example. He bet on himself and won after turning down our initial extension and got the bigger contract and he did it by playing a smaller role than he did the previous year.
Jason Collins and John Amaechi are the ones I recall.
He'll end up signing a deal similar to John Collins'. He's not a max player and the market will prove it.
"I think I made it out the draft pretty good I got a 14 man league and I have Luka, Lavine, Butler, John Collins, Valenciunas, Gordon Hayward, Shroder, Jalen Green, Rui, and Terrance Mann + kawhi obv"
"John Collins is a personal top 5 favorite player of mine, I would love it if he could just dominate with a few more inches"
"Hawks will be just fine. Hunter and Reddish back, they locked up John Collins and most importantly they locked up one of the most important positions, the coach. Its like people forget how bad they were to how good they got because of Nate. With essentially the same amount of games coached:  Lloyd Pierce - 14-20 - 41%  Nate McMillian - 27-11 - 71%  Got a $20 spot with my buddy they make it out of the 1st round."
Did John Collins give Embiid his nuts back?
"Ben is such a brat. Pouting as if he‚Äôs not the reason for the demise of the Sixers. This dude is a multiple all star/ all defensive player and got outplayed by Lou Williams, Kevin Huerter, and John Collins down the stretch. They ask him to work on his game and he gets offended and quits on his team smh. The entitlement is insane man."
"No reporters seem to think it‚Äôs a real possibility he‚Äôll take the QO though. Pretty much no one does that it‚Äôs too much money to give up. People bring up Hayward but they‚Äôre probably hoping to get him on a John Collins deal. I don‚Äôt think that will happen but I get why they‚Äôre not committing to five if they have doubts, given how much control they still have through RFA"
&gt; Thing is that he‚Äôs signing a max to another team anyways  After the JJJ and John Collins deals I am starting to think that this max offer is not out there for him.
tthats the thing I think he is worth john collins money exactly. I would not give him 35 mill.
Isn't what the Suns doing perfectly reasonable...John Collins did the same last season and Atlanta got him on close 8 million less a year than the max..You may claim Aytons got the higher ceiling and shit but Collins was 20/10 and shooting 40pct from three something Ayton hasn't shown he can do...Ayton was better defensively and Collins had the 4/5 tweener questions about him but given how Jaren Jackson has gone for 100million/4 yrs..I think it's reasonable for the suns to gamble a restricted free agency.
"As a fan of the Hawks, I think Ayton should go the John Collins route in this."
"Would he be that much better?   A 6'7 Trae Young isn't posting anyone up or dominating in the paint. His passing vision improves a little bit. Its not like he has a high shooting release, anyway. He'd still be a below average defender.   You'd be better off giving a few inches of height to John Collins and Hunter."
Jason Collins or John Amaechi
So um I've only watched him in the playoffs..never saw him in regular season.   How good is he really?   For instance like Red Velvet was awesome in the playoffs but the reason he signed a 4 year $65 mil deal I stead like a 5 year $125 or 5 year $100 mil deal is because during the regular season he's great but like he's not Trae or John Collins.  So in that respect. How good is DeAndre Ayton actually. Is like a killer in the regular season?
"It's actually rare for a player to get exactly what they deserve in terms of money. They get paid over or under. I also agree Ayton is currently not a max player by any means, but a few playoff rounds can magnify things. It's also more about looking at the contracts other players have gotten, the potential of Ayton, the chemistry on a team fighting for a championship...  Ayton is going to get paid the max or close to the max at some point, either by the Suns or by other team. If he deserves it or not is another story. Bridges is also overpaid imo but I guess an elite young role player with the potential to still get better costs that much nowadays. However I think it was the right move to wait, given the Suns can still match any offer. Hawks did the same John Collins and it worked out just fine."
He'd be John Collins' bitch in practices for sure.
Bro we had similar discussions last year about John Collins. And things work out in the end.
John Collins is not a max guy either so it was real negotiation on how much he should get paid compared to Ayton who we all know deserves the max.
"He's a 7 footer that plays extremely high level defense and he showed in the past that he can shoot.  He accepted a role and played it to perfection. He's probably better than a screen and roll big with solid defense.  Collins was a tweener and a bad defender. He could guard neither the 4 nor the 5 super well and most people thought that hunter was better at the 4 and capela was better at the 5. I think paying that player $125 mil over 5 years is a tough sell. They basically told Collins ""show us you can get better"" and he went out and did it so they paid him. No one thought that there wouldn't be a market at 4 for 100 for John even in the previous off season.   I'd say the difference between him and ayton is that ayton already proved himself by being a big reason that the suns made the finals. Every year, he's improved, and he's got very few weaknesses in his game. He's the franchise big you can build around."
Yeah I doubt he does that. I remember we had this same conversation last year with John Collins. This will go to RFA.
There‚Äôs no rush. John Collins signed well below a max. We could have offered him. We have a ton of space. We didn‚Äôt.   That‚Äôs not how Presti is going to do this rebuild. Not yet. It‚Äôs been 1/2 season of tanking. 1 high pick. We are years away
"&gt; I for one welcome the idea of Ayton playing his heart out for a max this year.   Exactly. In fact Ayton was one of those players I worried about how he would be after he got the bag, so now that he has to go out and prove himself, I‚Äôm excited to see how he does.   Hawks managed just fine with John Collins last year."
"Suns are attempting to do what the Hawks did with John Collins what many other teams have done in the past.  Collins wanted the max extension prior to last season and was upset when the Hawks didn't offer it because they weren't sure they needed to max him or that he was a max level player.  Fast forward a year and Collins is signed to a below max contract of 5/125 million.  Very few players who are good to great are able to leave the control of a team after their rookie contract due to the nature of RFA.  Hurt feelings and emotions could in some cases have an affect down the line, but usually it just comes down to simple economics"
Part of the John Collins issues were with the old coach though.  So at least that seemed like an easy fix.
"John Collins didn't get the max tho, if it's 25m a year, that's great, 35-40 for Ayton is too much"
"it'll be a John Collins situation. Hawks didn't offer him the max extension when he first became eligible, then got it done the following offseason."
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
Bruh John Collins is sitting on ur bench lol. He‚Äôs good defensively now
"Our supporting cast as of this moment is Capela, Huerter, John Collins and the corpse of Gallinari. Pretty equal to Tim hard away, Brunson and KP offensively"
"If the Suns don't think Ayton will get a max offer sheet from another team, that's a gamble they're willing to take (like what the Hawks did with John Collins). If by the end of the season they're convinced he will get max offers from other teams, they can still offer him a 5 year max that no other team can.   And Ayton isn't Lebron or Giannis, he's not going to take a 4 year deal when a 5 year deal is on the table just to get to UFA sooner, he's trying to get the most money possible and only the Suns can offer him that 5th year."
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
"Morant, Dejounte Murray, OG, Tobias Harris, Turner.  Bench: Herro, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, John Collins, Ayton.  I don't know if that's a contender but I think that's about as balanced as I can get on offense and defense."
John ‚Äúthe baptist‚Äù Collins.  Also tbh I hope he is an all star but I‚Äôm not sure if he will be but I like what Miles Bridges is doing.
Man y‚Äôall kill me with the exaggeration sometimes. It was a nice dunk with some contact but this isnt an absolute poster. You need more body contact for it to be an ‚Äúabsolute poster‚Äù. Sengun mostly dunked around the the defender  Sorry for the rant but titles like this have me expecting Anthony Edwards/John Collins kind of posters.
Kristaps ‚ÄúJohn Collins‚Äù Porzingis
"I mean‚Ä¶ it has John Collins, Fred VanVleet, and Alex Caruso as better players than Durant  And it has Gary Payton II as the 21st best player in the league  And it has the Warriors at 4% chance to win the championship at this point in time (with an 18-2 record!) even though it assumes Klay will return."
"It's not the exact same situation at all. Hayward was a 100% healthy player and the Jazz didn't offer him a max basically because they didn't think he was a franchise player, so it makes total sense why he got pissed off to the point of wanting to leave about that. If the Nuggets hadn't offered MPJ a max, it would have been totally unrelated to his play on the court and out of an abundance of caution related to his well know history of back injury. Am I saying they shouldn't have made him an offer at all? No, but they should have pushed for a big discount off the max. He's not happy with that? Go out and prove that last season was real and you can stay healthy. We did the same shit with John Collins this past season, albeit there was never a max offer on the table and health was never a concern. Do you think JC is so pissed off purely because he didn't get the initial extension that he's going to leave at the end of this second deal, even though he eventually ended up getting the money he wanted? Highly unlikely. I'm sorry but the Nuggets not offering him the max would have been nowhere near comparable to the Hayward situation, they are not analogous whatsoever other than superficial details."
"I would have looked at John Collins with Atlanta as to what realistically happens to the Close-to-max players when they hit RFA.  Denver is clearly a smart FO and is without question the best drafting team of the last decade, but they saw what happened with Collins, where ATL offered him $80 over 4 years and John bet on himself; when he proved worth it, the team signed him to a near-max contract at $125 over 5 with a PO.  MPJ did not prove himself to be a player to be much higher valued than JC.  To get the max rookie extension with no questions, the guy should be at a fringe All-NBA level, otherwise this type of situation limits teams drastically. Going to RFA and matching otherwise is much smarter as an org. MPJ always had to many questions marks for this to make sense"

I like John Collins or Jared Jackson comparisons with those two.
"Yeah, maybe it's just that I'm seeing frequency from those guys that I don't get with Scottie. I'll have to pay closer attention the next time I catch a Raps game.   Scottie was one of my 3 ""My Guys"" heading into the draft (along with Giddey and Sengun)  In case you're curious, over the last 5 years, my My Guys were LaMelo and Haliburton last year, Ja and NAW 2 years ago (might be 1-for-2 on them. NAW keeps not happening.), Luka and SGA 3 years ago, De'Aaron Fox and John Collins 4 years ago, and Sabonis+Poeltl 5 years ago"
"it's also really bad considering he should be taking some of the highest efficiency shots in the game playing as a roll man with westbrook and Lebron. Compare him to other bigs like Jokic, Ayton, KAT, Bam, Valanciunas, Sabonis, John Collins are all light years ahead in TS%."
He bumped knees with John Collins
"In a world where we don't have John Collins I guess I'd be willing to give up Huerter + Gallo for him, no way the Grizzlies would consider that though."
"I also know that Bogdanvic and Capella who've been in the league for a while now both look massively improved now that they play with Trae. I also know that John Collins doesn't look nearly as good when he plays with Delon Wright or Lou Williams - both of whom are competent PGs. Maybe some of the credit for Trae's teammates playing so well should go to him.  All I'm saying is that everyone always says Luka is way better and has a way worse team, but every other great player with a bad team has massive on/off numbers. AD had +8.8, +9.4, and +9.7 his last three years in NOLA. KAT has +9.0, +11.2, +5.3 last three years in Minny, etc."
If JJJ realizes even 70% of his full potential he‚Äôs going to be a game changer in ways John Collins just cannot be.   His ceiling is a prototypical modern big man straight out of the wet dreams of every NBA GM.
"I am both a Pacers Fan and Hawks fan, the Pacers fans seem to really be down on Myles Turner, the Hawks fans were down on John Collins pre new contract and now it's Dieng who is a poor substitute for Okangwu, and they aren't too hot on Solomon Hill."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1.

I love John Collins so much man üò©
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
John Collins is better than Miles Bridges man
"I‚Äôm not aware of the rules, but I do remember John Collins smoothing over a red when Young was going to get himself a tech."
I honestly don't think more than 10% of people legitimately thought Trae or John Collins weren't better choices lol but I guess...
Why would you want to be squished down into a ball before John Collins yams you?
How friccin chill would it be to have John Collins squish your whole body down to the size of a basketball and absolutely yam you through the hoop?
John Collins has the nastiest in game dunks right now
John Collins has such satisfying dunks.
Trae + John Collins. But only people who watch the hawks know that.
"I would watch the Spurs.  Plenty of money to burn, desperate for a young scorer at the 3/4, generally a team that needs to overpay to get free agents.  I was surprised they didn‚Äôt throw a max (or close to it) at John Collins this off-season."
"John Collins.  His face ups, fadeaways, dunks, OREB, and now improved playmaking and defense.  Really fun to watch when we actually give him shot attempts"
"John Collins is my dad.  But in all seriousness. Collins is ballin, Trae is ballin. The team has that swagger back. They suck on the road, though."
It honestly shocks me John Collins hasnt once been in MIP conversations
Freak Athlete starting 5:  Giannis John Collins  in shape/healthy Zion Ant Ja  JC is a homer pick that I will defend irrationally.
John Collins with the 4x5. He's honestly so essential to everything we do when winning. His passing game has opened up our offense and the Trae/JC Pick and Roll is disgustingly effective still.
John Collins has a highlight dunks every game.
"A lot of Western Conference point guards could be on this list, but John Collins and Clint Capela are my homer answers but for real JC is playing at an all star level (especially this year)"
John Collins needs to be on the list somewhere
"It's crazy to me how so many people initially viewed both Jarrett Allen and John Collins contracts as overpays not too long ago. Both fanbases feel like they scored a pretty good deal at this point in the season though, with both of them having seemingly improved aspects of their game in the off-season."
"Can you link the multiple Embiid pushes on DeAndre Jordan and John Collins ones? Not doubting you, just haven‚Äôt seen em."
I think I have witnessed LeBron being pushed like this more then 1000x times over the last 20 years. I haven't seen Livingston being dirty but I've seen Embiid doing the same to eather DeAndre Jordan or John Collins multiple times in single games. Why is this event with LeBron and Joel singled out so much?
Explain why cannot you match any offers after this season when he's a RFA? What's preventing nuggets from treating him similarly like how Hawks treat John Collins?
he is getting paid less then john collins. Contract is tradable on purpose.
John Collins and Jalen Green
‚ÄúJohn Collins doesn‚Äôt translate to the NBA‚Äù  jeez
"John Collins should get a mention. He really has Stoudemire upside when paired with Trae. His touch is insane and he has continuously improved year to year turning into a legit post-up threat while developing his 3-ball. His first 2 years had him averaging 20-10, but last year the team got more talented, he started to develop the little skills that contribute to winning and don't show up on a stat sheet.  He has taken another step this year turning into a better playmaker and shot creator. He has had the type of growth fans dream their guys have year to year and really has not shown any reason to doubt his ability to continue to get better"
"Leftovers? Mitchell was the 13th pick. Fox averaged 25 pts at 47% shooting + 7 assists last season. Among all those players, Lonzo belongs at best among the 10 top picks. A top 3 for him is a fucking absurd, we're talking about the draft who had Mitchell, Tatum and Fox, then you have Bam Adebayo, John Collins, Jarret Allen... how in the name of hell Lonzo belongs in a top 3 among these players? And again, a top pick between 1 and 3 is supposed to have a talent level similar to Tatum, Luka, Embiid, etc.. you name it, that's their supposed potential, how Lonzo gets close to that? It's unbelievable how people have the audacity of defending this dude, the reality show bullshit is still in effect after 4 years?"
Bruh no way Luka and harden are above Trae and Ja for this season. I would also put John Collins above randle so far and lebron needs to be moved down a lot
"I dont think DeMar is at that level of an in game dunker anymore.   DJJ, Lavine, Giannis, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Ja Morant, Paul George, Anthony Edwards, Larry Nance Jr, Zion, and maybe Kawhi I'd take over him."
"Miles Bridges, John Collins &gt; gp2"
Reminds me a lot of the John Collins discourse last year
My homer take is John Collins has an argument over Randle if you look at efficiency..
weren't John Collins and ayton the 2 suspended last year
hawks: john collins  at least add that in
John Collins
"Hawks - K‚Äôvon, John Collins is a close 2nd"
"here's who did it each season...  2021: Micheal Porter Jr.   2020: John Collins, TJ Warren, Hassan Whiteside\* (\*shot 0.1 3PA per game so shouldn‚Äôt count)   2019: Malcolm Brogdon   2018: KAT   2017: No One   2016: Kawhi Leonard   2015: No One   2014: No One"
"Pg. Deaaron fox, ja morant,  Russell westbrook.   Sg. Jalen green,  Zach lavine , anfernee simmons, Anthony edwards   Sf. Lebron James, Paul George, miles bridges, Jayson Tatum   Pf. Giannas antekounmpo. Aaron Gordon. John Collins. Pascal siakam  C. Karl Anthony towns. Jarret Allen.  DeAndre ayton"
John Collins is so fucking good at finishing plays it‚Äôs insane.
"Only through solidarity will the GMs of the NBA continue to be able to create toxic workplace environments, harass &amp; belittle their employees all while trading future picks for albatross contracts attached to washed stars of yore in a last-ditch effort to save their jobs.   Also if handing out $200M+ worth of contracts to Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard &amp; Moe Harkless and then passing on the likes of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby &amp; John Collins for Zach Collins isn't justifiable cause to fire someone IDK what is..."

"They've done well, but those were some high picks also. Its a lot easier to draft well when you pick at #2 every year.  * Randle at 7 was a good pick, but not the best pick in that draft or anything. Still, I'd say he'd go higher in a redraft so props to them for the pick. * Rusell went #2 in 2015. People have a wide range of opinions, I tend to think he's overrated. Not a bust or anything, but you figure they'd pick up Booker in a redraft, and probably also take Porzingis and Myles Turner ahead of him. The Lakers got Larry Nance late in this draft, which I do think is actually a really good pick. I'd rather have him than Russell, honestly. * Ingram #2 in 2016. Another good, not great pick. Went before Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Brogdon and Dejounte Murray. Not sure how a redraft would go, but probably he isn't the 2nd best player in the draft. * Lonzo went #2 in 2017 right ahead of Tatum. Bam and Donovan Mitchell also went in the lottery that year. I think he goes behind those guys for sure in a redraft, and also maybe Fox, Jarret Allan, OG, and John Collins. Not a bust, but probably not like a great pick either.  Overall I'd say good but not great picks. They didn't get any real busts, so I give them credit, but they also picked super high 3 years in a row. They could have a team with Randle, Booker, Turner, Siakam, and Donovan Mitchell or something and win 70 games."
The Trae Young and John Collins duo is a menace to fantasy basketball
"Shooting is like the most important part of the game, you guys sold out to stop trae and double teamed him leaving us with easy 3s or feeds to John Collins in the post."
I love John Collins
Is it just me or do Jordan Poole and John Collins look like they could be brothers?

John Collins is a top 50 player and it is particularly close
I said that so you couldn‚Äôt tell me DLo was a one time all star lmao but in reality it doesn‚Äôt even have to be all star but someone of that caliber(CJ or John Collins maybe). Not one dude around KAT can create his own shot and he‚Äôs not surrounded by shooters. As a Center you need at least one of those skills. We‚Äôre legit talking about some of the most consistently poorly constructed rosters in history. My guy they have one .500 season in 16 fucking years. Don‚Äôt give me that bs when their drafts are some of the worst in recent memory too.   The guys you mentioned are legit all top 10 players which KAT is not as I already said. Would you not push for a guy like DLo thinking you were getting an all star caliber player? And I‚Äôm not addressing the Jimmy Butler stuff again lmao
"Trae needs have a new shoe come out every game. He absolutely killed it. Amazed at how good John Collins has become, improves every off season. Really a complete player now."
"Since nobody answered, it‚Äôs 538‚Äôs all encompassing metric. It‚Äôs basically part box score numbers (ala PER) and part on/off splits. According to RAPTOR, the best players in the league so far this year are Jokic, Derrick Rose, Giannis, Curry, Butler, Iguodala, Brunson, PG13, Bjelica, and John Collins."
"No, probably looking at a John Collins-esque situation."
"Literally no one not named Trae Young or John Collins has been playing well. Defensive effort and execution has been piss poor across the board, and Huerter/Gallinari/Hunter have all been cold from the field for the most part.   We also have several players who have seemingly forgotten how to pass the basketball (Hunter, reddish, gallinari) and are ruining any semblance of ball movement that the offense should have (Hunter‚Äôs assist rate is 3% which is absurdly terrible). Cam Reddish had a handful of good games to start the season and has been complete trash on both ends since then."
Replace Anthony Davis with a guy like John Collins and the Lakers still win the title
"If last year in that series, John Collins suddenly decided he wasn't going to shoot in any of the 4th quarters and instead of throwing down that dunk over Joel, he passed it up do you think you would still have won?  The second best player on a team being out is one thing.  The second best player on a team being out on the court and actively being a huge negative is a totally different thing."
"John Collins is actually good at defense now, and Huerter is pretty good normally too, that was just steph being steph and us only sticking one defender on him. On the other hand capela has been abysmal this season so far which has killed us, and our defensive rotations have been terrible plus we‚Äôve been collapsing way too much leaving shooters wide open."
Him and John Collins carrying sadly
"They are experimenting, plus Capela struggles with easy looks which I think will not last too much. They are trying to play more John Collins and Trae pnrs as well as give Cam more attempts as he showed improvments but is still inconsistent, and Gallinaris and Lous production dropped by half. So yeah a bit of individual players struggling and a bit of trying to develop some extra to push them over the edge."
John Collins and the mavs
"LeBron, Dominique, Shaq, Dr J, T Mac, Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp, Stromile Swift, Tyrus Thomas, Amare, John Collins, Darryl Dawkins, Deandre Jordan‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm gonna respectfully disagree."
Lmao. Let's get Marcus Smart and John Collins in here too
"Nobody trading Dame or Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons  Simmons prob yield a return in the likes of Marcus Smart and asset, Deaaron Fox and something, CJ MCollum and assets,   Hawks is interesting tho, I don‚Äôt think they want to pay Reddish so he could be a trade piece, John Collins doesn‚Äôt make enough money as Simmons and he‚Äôs kinda important for the Hawks as a versatile scorer and just overall great lockerroom leader..there‚Äôs some intangibles and offensive off ball skillset that compliment Trae better. I‚Äôd pair Simmons and Trae only if Trae is an excellent off ball player, which Trae is not, he‚Äôs ok, but not that good off ball, you actually want Trae on ball."
"Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt better than John Collins, why on earth would the Hawks do this trade?"
"They‚Äôre not as much as floor spacing but having two players you can extremely physical with/ you can intentionally hack to get possessions back isn‚Äôt good.  Mobley has showcased an excellent mid range shot so far in the league. It‚Äôs also a 10 game sample which might crumble in the coming weeks.   And you‚Äôre the one oversimplifying the concept of having 4 shooters. That doesn‚Äôt mean 4 spot up guys simply  waiting for catch and shoot opportunities like the old rockets. Atlanta‚Äôs offence has plenty of complexity. Between bogdans shot creation, deandres mid range pull-ups, John Collins being a pick and roll/ rim running demon, etc. It‚Äôs not like the team only shoots 3s. But they need to be shooting threats. Otherwise they‚Äôre much easier to defend. Capela and Ben aren‚Äôt post up guys, and can‚Äôt shoot whatsoever. Defenders will leave them open and clog the paint. Having two defenders to that makes teams remarkably easy to defend"
It‚Äôd be a heck of a lot easier to trade John Collins though. But I‚Äôm not sure what the rule is for trading players you just traded for.
"I am fascinated that you are aware that KAT for Cade Cunningham + Stewart + picks and filler (maybe grant) is unlikely to happen but think that the Wolves can get Siakam and Scottie Barnes for KAT or John Collins, Reddish, Huerter + picks"
PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: Miles Bridges  PF: John Collins  C: Bam Adebayo
"John collins wore embiid poster tshirt. Its just a banter, getting dunked on isnt that big of deal as u think"
If John Collins can succeed in this league so can Bagley. IF he stays healthy. And that's a big IF.
"John Collins. Actually probably the only guy thats playing well for us. Improved his defense, passing, shooting, and post ups. Glad he got paid"
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
"His own NBA execs drafted TJ Leaf over OG and John Collins so idk if they're the best measuring stick lol. Clint is a great player, but I think he's comparable to Turner. Turner scores more and gets more blocks if we're just looking at stats. I know Clint is a better roll-man, but Myles give you the option to run pick and rolls or pick and pops."
"The Hawks have so many young forwards with very high potential. Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Jalen Johnson. I doubt you can develop all those guys while also having John Collins"
They should trade for Capella or John Collins
"I could really go either way on those two. I'm leaning towards Kyrie because we've seen him in winning situations, but he seems to have gotten a bit crazier since then so I don't know how much that actually matters. Then again, something is going on with Trae now, but I don't know how much that impacts the ranking until we know more about that. If it really is that Steve Nash criticized him and he just lost his confidence, I don't think that's good. If it is that John Collins called him out in a film room session and now he's pouting, that's bad too. I think I'd take Kyrie, but with his history, injury and otherwise, and with this new stuff with Trae coming out, it's a tough one."
"John Collins. His trade value is only going to drop this year as his usage goes down. We‚Äôve got too many guys deserving of minutes, and I just don‚Äôt see Collins making the necessary improvements on  defense and playmaking. I like the guy and the things he does well, but he is too limited in what he can do. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be a great addition for many teams, but I don‚Äôt think he fits with this team especially considering we have Capela and drafted Okongwu who is superior on defense and can play the P&amp;R at a similar level."
"John Collins. This guy is really fuckin talented. I know he's still young, it's only his 4th season. But he is easily capable of putting up 23 and 10 on any given night. An offensive threat all around, not a bad shooter either.   I really thought he was going to be a breakout star this year, possibly even average like 25 and 11. But it looks like he regressed, or maybe its just Hawks still adjusting to new roster."
John Collins and DeAndre Ayton.   They both got 25 game suspensions last year.
"&gt;His role is to be the truth teller. Trae Young is a horrendous teammate  Be John Collins.  Get suspended 25 games for steroids.  Be upset that you don't get a max extension because ""25 games suspension"" doesn't scream franchise cornerstone.  Complain when the team is 4-1, because you aren't getting enough touches to boost your stats and get more money next summer.  Somehow get labeled ""truth-teller"" for complaining about your stats, and it's the other guy who didn't get suspended that's the ""bad teammate."""
"OKC Fan: I fucking love this team. Dort is a reddit darling and MIP candidate. Shai is the super star you build around. Baze is still only in his second year and getting better. Theo Maledon looks like he should have been a top 20 pick. Poku is a meme lord atm but has a crazy ceiling.   I'd argue every player on the squad sans Horford and Hill are underrated. Even Roby and Kenny ""hustle"" Williams are actual NBA players.   With the situation we're in (picks for days) we're the least applicable team for this hypothetical. Reading though this thread though I'd LOVE to have some of these guys people are giving up on.   Colby White, Lauri Markennen (sp), Wendell Carter Jr... Bulls you want to go for the playoffs?... Have Hill and Horford.   &amp;#x200B;  John Collins... He'd be awesome in OKC.   &amp;#x200B;  Bagley. Kings WANT to be good. George Hill and Muscala for Bagley?"
"I'm off the John Collins train. Besides him trying to get a max, Capela is way too similar and is hurting his production and  they even drafted a center. Someone else can pay him, Hawks need someone like Draymond at the 4 spot. If he's willing to take a discount then keep him, but he seems like a prime sign and trade candidate."
Trae young and John Collins
"I love LaMarcus Aldridge, he‚Äôs the biggest FA signing of our franchise, put up numbers for us early in his stint here, was a professional with the nephew situation and still carried us to the playoffs, but unfortunately he looks to be in the twilight of his career now. I was expecting him to play better this year since he‚Äôs on a contract year but at age 36 most players really start to decline. His perimeter D is non existent, and although he‚Äôs taking a higher volume of 3‚Äôs the results weren‚Äôt what we were expecting. So many spurs fans are reactionary and call him ‚Äúwashed‚Äù, ‚Äúcorpse‚Äù, etc. and while I understand the premise I find it so disrespectful considering everything else he‚Äôs done for us. Wish we traded him at last years deadline when he had some value, but this was going to happen eventually. Jakob is going to have to get to Tiago Splitter level if we want a chance at the playoffs. I‚Äôm not asking for much but just a passable big to cheese us through the rest of the season. In the meantime I‚Äôll be praying for a John Collins overpay Max deal next summer"
"John Collins gone in the next month, Pierce gone at end of season."
Lonzo + 2nd round pick for John Collins who says no
"This sub doesn‚Äôt realize Collins stats are largely tied to how many pick n rolls his PG runs with him. He struggles to score outside of that, offensive put backs, and spot up 3s. Clint Capela clogs the paint so John is limited in his pick n roll opportunities.  You can combat this by playing John at the 5 offensively but he‚Äôs an absolute turnstile on the interior against bigger players.   Either John expands his offensive game in a way that gets him good looks, or he‚Äôs relegated to the role he‚Äôs currently in. Because Clint is a game changer on the glass and defensively overall. Collins is a slightly below neutral defensively at best. His value on the court fluctuates too much for someone who wants a max contract.   If the Hawks were to move Capela for a shooting center, that‚Äôd ease things up. But then the team defense suffers...it‚Äôs hard when Trae AND Collins need players around them to make up for their defensive deficiencies. No one ever talks about Collins defense but you‚Äôll see a random Trae defense post every week here"
John Collins.
Both trae young and John Collins act like they are better then they actually are lmao
"John Collins is in the right to ask a trade, Trae is a wannabe Steph Curry."
Defensive specialist Carmelo Anthony locking up John Collins and sending him to the bench.
Would you trade pascal Siakam for John Collins(for the sake of this let‚Äôs say you could swap them 1 for 1 even though salary rules wouldn‚Äôt allow it)  If you really want to go bold what about Jerami Grant
"Yeah John Collins to a potential max itll be very interesting to see if Atl matches. It would create a massive payroll for an owner who's only paid the tax like twice and that was for like $2-3 mil over.   Thing with JC is he's not a 5, so playing him at a 4 its workable but it also doesnt provide as much flexibility especially if they keep DeRozan. This also might not be a bad Lauri Markkanen destination.   I dont think they want to go full on tanking. There enough of these Spencer Dinwiddie type FAs they could sign and I bet will try to to stay out of the bottom tier. I also think there is enough baseline talent here to prevent them from being a bottom feeder and theyll be able to draft more guys also. For DeRozan I bet if they offer like 3 yrs $70ish mil he would stay. Im not sure I would but that's probably what he would ask. Once LMA is gone, biggest goal is probably just finding the 5 to round things out and whether or not they believe that's Poeltl."
"Yeah I see us just letting Aldridge go at the end of the season. I can see us resigning Derozan to like a 1+1 with a team just to allow another year or two of development for our young guys. I could also see us letting him go and just full on tanking, or maybe be able to sign John Collins or Jarrett Allen with all the money we have"
"John Collins basically threw him under the bus, Collins also denied an extension to look for the max. Collins also says he wants the ball more. This was all public, Trae isn't wrong in any of this and anybody surprised he is struggling. This isn't the type of stuff you say publicly.  Trae has a clear goal to be a bigger threat scoring hence he tried to cheese calls, he was prepared because the past two years he's been completely running the offense on himself his team has been bad at turnovers and creating their own shot. He is still top 5 playmaker in the league.  Frankly it's common sense to me, I highly doubt Trae young doesn't want to pass the ball just because he's too good at it and it's been pretty fucking easy for him. I just think he tried to be more aggressive because his team sucks but at the end of the day he will still p ass the ball, hes waay too smart not to."

"Right? We've always had statistical ebbs and flows (i.e. the Wilt-Russell rebound era) but I think this is the first time (the past few years) I've seen such a dramatic shift in the last 30 years or so, which makes statistical comparison over recent eras even tougher than it already was.   Like, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with Luka triple-double stats being compared directly to Jason Kidd's 1995 triple-double stats. I know it's impressive but it also feels odd to make those sort of comparisons without acknowledging what kind of numbers Jason Kidd might have put up in today's super guard-friendly rebound-and-dime era.   Statistics as a whole are pretty wild these days. At first I'd be blown away by some of the obnoxious stat lines (say, John Collins casually dropping a 20/25 in 2018 or 2019) then eventually I began to realize that *a lot* of players are putting up obnoxious statlines."
"I mean there was just an issue between John Collins, the coaching staff, and Trae about how Trae specifically isn‚Äôt a pass first point guard and that he‚Äôs not giving the offense a chance to work."
Between John Collins salty ass and Steve Nash old head mentality this is the result
"how do u figure he‚Äôs gonna find that out lmao, he‚Äôs the franchise superstar what‚Äôre they gonna trade him to keep john collins happy"
We will take John Collins off their hands. We got a nice TPE with a late 1st round pick.
"Lol come on, they aren't trading Wiseman for John Collins, let alone throwing in two firsts"
"They're gonna need a lot more out of Trae Young and John Collins as well, but getting those guys back will definitely help."
"we have 3  centers. tristan thompson looks great, Theis is decent. and Robert Williams looks great in the few minutes he comes off the bench  we need to use our TPE for probably a backup wing/2 guard combo or a power forward like john collins"
Could you imagine John Collins in San Antonio? I know r/NBASpurs can.
"I think John Collins would look cool on the Hornets, but if the hawks deal him over Cappella i don't get it"
"We need a new coach.   Besides individual improvement of Trae Young and John Collins there is no improvement on the team.   To be quite honest I really don't know how of Trae's improvement was on Lloyd Pierce or if it is pure talent from Trae.  Unless they make the playoffs, Lloyd Pierce is gone."
Team chem seems off ever since John Collins spoke out. They have to do something
"John Collins will probably get traded, I don't think they want to potentially max him in the offseason either"
John Collins?
"Personally, I feel like a John Collins jersey would have been a more appropriate gift"
john collins looking real nice üëÄ
"PJ is such a low-key stud.  Kinda surprised that he seems to be under rated on these threads.  Like I guess he's not exploded offensively in his second year (yet), but i could easily see him push that 36-37% 3 to the 40 range, push his scoring to that 17-20ppg range, his boards to that 7-8 a game range, etc.  And do all that while being this extremely solid, versatile defensive player, who is a great chemistry piece, and will prolly stay relatively cheap on his second deal cos he's not john collins or whatever."
Help us John Collins
"hes done a lot of bad things, there is a copypasta list out there that keeps getting added to, this is wha ti found on a 10 second google search for that pasta  Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  Ran ISO-ball all the time  Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy  Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team  Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts  Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""  Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc) No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes"
"I‚Äôm not giving up a top 5 protected and another first in 2022 along with nance for John Collins. That would be a steal for the hawks. Nance does a lot more than is shown on the box score. He is the ultimate glue guy. Plus, he‚Äôs Cleveland born and raised. The fans and the org alike love him, he‚Äôs a true cavalier.   Obviously it‚Äôs not my call, but I still wouldn‚Äôt do it. We have a pretty good looking squad already when we‚Äôre actually healthy, problem is we have like 7 injured players."
"Beal for John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish and 2022 first. If you don't think that's enough then swap Hunter for Huerter or add another first."
"I'm only saying the only way the Raps get one of those big men but I don't think it would happen or would be a good idea for the Cavs.  But I do think LNJ could potentially be traded. Love is going nowhere on that contract but he belongs on the bench. Jarrett Allen will supplant Drummond as the starter and Drummond will leave in FA. LNJ is great, especially his contract, but I could see him being moved.   What do you think of LNJ, 2021 1st (top 5 protected), and 2022 Bucks 1st for John Collins? Think he'd be a decent pairing with Jarrett Allen."
I‚Äôm looking at the top guys that are going to get dealt is....  1. Kyle Lowry  2. DeMar DeRozan  3. Andre Drummond  4. John Collins  5. Victor Oladipo
"Ok. Fair play if it's an old story, but it does seem to check out - [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense)"
"Yeah that's when Run TMC was but there was no openly gay player then. The first (and I believe only) openly gay player in the NBA was Jason Collins, who came out in like 2014 and only played a few games after he came out. John Amaechi also came out but after his career was over.  I believe the reason they were discussing it in 2007 is because John Amaechi had recently come out and the debate of gay marriage/rights was a big issue in the culture."
I've been thinking that we needed to target John Collins cuz I legit didn't think we could snag Allen
"&gt; two 22 year olds on the way up with a high ceiling  lmfao when will people realize Lonzo is NOT good. And people forget we got 2 picks out of them, one of them is Keldon Johnson. He didn't sabotage the franchise but yeah I agree he definitely didn't help them either not taking Ingram. Hopefully we can throw a max at John Collins"
"Harden is going to the Knicks in exchange for Barrett, Toppin, Randle, and lots of picks.  The Knicks are good with this because they are convinced Kawhi Leonard will also sign in free agency this summer. He will not. Then the Knicks will max John Collins. The Rockets are good with this because the Knicks picks will be way better than the picks they would have gotten from Brooklyn or Philly.  and there they will be. James Harden, John Collins, and a bunch of scrubs. Your New York Knicks."
"I wouldn't trade Luka even for Trae, Reddish AND John Collins."
Could Collins sign an extension to increase his value? I‚Äôm pretty sure if he signs an extension then his new contract value will be used as the team could easily circumvent the salary cap by trading for a cheap Collins who then balloons his salary.  John Collins + one of their newly signed guys + picks for Wood and Harden actually makes sense to me.
"I think we should flip him too. John's role is starting to become limited here in Atlanta, Capela has sorta replaced him in the P&amp;R and Hunter and him basically have the same pull now. John isn't really agressive enough to get stats unless he's spoon fed or it's a Julius Randle type situation where you just pass him the ball and let him go to work. Onyeka will probably determine John's future in Atlanta. Onyeka projects to do a lot of the stuff Collins does (while on a smaller sample size) and to be a better defender and when you consider the fact that he isn't up for the max and chances are we won't have to give him one down the line if John's fit in Atlanta doesn't start to get better John will very quickly become and expandable piece in our rebuild, especially with hunter stepping up offensively. I'd love if we could get John for a two way star to put next to Trae though, a guy like Siakam makes this team really dangerous even if we'd have to overpay to get him, but it's unlikely."
"I think we'd be best off consolidating assets for a more reliable second option. Collins can't win games for us and If you've been watching hawks game this year while the chemistry isn't bad like some people say John is getting less touches. It's mainly because Capela is sorta replacing him in the P&amp;R and Hunter is getting more and more touches and is beginning to compete with John as a second option. How Onyeka plays will determine wether John has a future in Atlanta, ideally Onyeka should be able to do the same thing John does even if it's on a smaller volume. I don't see a world where John walks for nothing though, our GM is pretty smart and I can imagine that he'd recognize how much losing John for nothing would set us back and he'll probably make up his mind on wether John will get his contract matched by us or he'll be traded by the deadline."
"I wonder if ATL could string together something. Christian Wood, John Wall, John Collins, and Reddish? That's a pretty formidable squad for Houston.  And what East backcourt can stop Trae and Harden? All evidence suggests Capela and Harden have good chemistry on and off the court..."
"How will you explain about when the mavs were cheeks then Luka came immediately improved the team's standing as a rook then a year after made the playoffs in which he was historically great? John Collins was reported to be frustrated with trae about the way he plays which doesn't translate to winning. Trae's got help now, still ain't winning. Give that roster to Luka they'd be around top of the conference."
"I dunno. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an older dude, but I still play basketball and these young guys now like to randomly jack up 35 footers because that‚Äôs what guys in the league do now.  They even make them sometimes but it pisses me off even time they shoot those shots.   I know they‚Äôre not Trae Young but I‚Äôm imagining John Collins running down the floor and trying to run a set but watching some ridiculous attempt like it‚Äôs a game of horse.  Maybe John Collins is old at heart like me"
Was John Collins an all star last year? Or in Consideration?
"If a player is talking about a teammate to the media, you think that came out of nowhere? Or are you denying what John Collins said?"
"I think more likely is his team revolted against him in the locker room (John Collins media comment was probably tip of the iceberg) and demanded he stop playing like a ballhog and the coach (who Trae also dislikes) dropped the hammer on him.  What do modern kids do? Improve and find a better way to play? No, they sulk and go emo."
"&gt; that John Collins might not actually like Trae  Yeah, I could see this being false. I've worked with plenty of people I personally liked but didn't like working with.  &gt; like playing with Trae  This one is clearly damage control though, or else there wouldn't have been a confrontation about it during a film session an entire 5 games into the season."
You didnt hear? Let me find a link.  [here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense)
"Any chemistry they had in the first few games had seemingly vanished. Trae‚Äôs in a slump, everyone‚Äôs missing open shots, Lloyd Pierce is drawing up plays centered around broke ass Capela jump hooks, everyone just stands around when they don‚Äôt have the ball (especially Trae) and when they do actually get the ball it‚Äôs just a bunch of trash ass ISO play. Gallo and Rondo are perpetually hurt, Bogdan‚Äôs X button doesn‚Äôt work so he never sees a shot he doesn‚Äôt like (and usually he just bricks it anyway) and now even *he‚Äôs* hurt. Bench production has kinda fallen off a cliff too, leading to our best player off the bench being Solomon Hill.  And that‚Äôs just on offense, how much of a defensive liability a lot of our key guys are really sinks in when they can‚Äôt make shots. Trae would probably get yammed on by Stephen Hawking and then he‚Äôll take the ball full steam down the court and throw up a bum ass layup in traffic in a worthless attempt to retaliate.   All that is secondary though, the primary problem is that John Collins is without a doubt our most efficient player but he‚Äôs not getting the ball nearly enough."
What was the John Collins team film room stuff?
"yeah between that, the John Collins team film room debacle leaking out and I keep hearing on podcasts with insiders that they hear pretty often that guys don't like playing with Trae. its definitely been a lot all at once for someone who was statistically crushing it this past year and change so I imagine it can have that affect."
I think he's playing the way Collins want to make a point. That they're better playing his style of play than whatever John Collins want.
"According to KOC and Vernon on fridays mismatch, he got called out by John Collins in a meeting about how they‚Äôre (Trae) running the offense. Maybe it‚Äôs messing with his psyche."
"When John Collins is the only other shooter on the team then sure, Trae is going to get more guys sagging off to him.  Steph has gotten literally BOXED at halfcourt by multiple teams this season, not just doubled."
"John Collins needs to stfu and play his role. He's not a superstar..and ever since he's started chirping the ONLY star on that team has gone ice fucking cold and mentally doesn't look like he's in it. Collins is an athletic 4, you're literally on every team JC."
Is John Collins the new Paul George ?
"Yeah, no shit. If John Collins is rocking the boat, bench John Collins, don't piss off your franchise cornerstone."
This Hawks team is straight up wasting John Collins' potential and it's starting to look like a grudge because he bet on himself. Better to trade him now and get some value out of his contract rather than create a PR nightmare and deter FAs from signing with them in the future because of this disgusting case of both Trae and Pierce causing his regression.
Yeah because that‚Äôs a stupid fucking opinion. John Collins and Trae are still friends lol. He‚Äôs just in a slump.
This years Aaron Gordon award goes to John Collins and the Atlanta Hawks
John Collins was right.
I really think it‚Äôs internal pressure from guys like John Collins wanting to be a bigger part of the offense. It‚Äôs really screwed with Trae‚Äôs game. When he was playing his game at the beginning of the season our offense was explosive.   Now I feel like Trae has lost confidence in his shot. When Trae plays to his strengths it‚Äôll open up the offense for other guys. It‚Äôs driving me crazy watching Trae be so passive.
If I was John Collins I‚Äôd be mad at Trae too
"That's way too much given up for a player who's stock is rick bottom. Why would we want a worse offensive, better defensive John Collins for the max? And give up our 6th man, and starting center and draft pick."
"Yeah it's a pretty bad cycle - no touches means he rushes shots which means he misses badly which means even less touches. Though, even John Collins is pissed about the offense and Trae looked to be pissed with John's concerns so this isn't looking good for Atlanta."
Lmao All NBA forward vs John Collins
No one on the Warriors mad about Steph hogging the ball tonight.   Trae Young with the weird comment on John Collins comment.  Players hate playing with him.
Neither. Siakam will be out of the NBA after his current contract and John Collins is being toxic
John Collins: 20/10 this year gets me a max from some team. 16/6 gets me Mason Plumlee‚Äôs contract.  This offense is bad. Fuck you Trae and your hair. Don‚Äôt think I forgot about you Clint and you stealing all my rebounds.
If John Collins wants the big ol' women we'll absolutely get him the big ol' women
Him   John Collins in a pistons uniform next year sounds kinda nice and would help our rebuild considering our best center is Mason Plumlee...
The only players in NBA history to avg 20 ppg and 63% EFG:  Wilt Chamberlain John Collins  !!
John Collins would look good on Charlotte with ball and Hayward.
"Whiteside shouldn't even be in a conversation when talking about John Collins. Drummond is a bit more difficult because he's a rebounding monster, but I'd rather have John putting up a consistent 20/10 while being able to shoot 3s and offer at least some rim protection. Drummond could be far more impactful if he had better BBIQ. I don't think Whiteside ever gave a shit and has always been statpadding - BBIQ would be wasted on him b/c his desire to chase stats would nullify it."
Someone wants a max contract - when the team is struggling now is the best time to bring it up. He is only playing 2.4 mpg this year I would 100% do the same thing  Some very small sample offensive stats  ATL is 5th in offensive (114 ortg)  With Trae on the court Hawks have a offensive rating is 117.1 compared to 105.9 (+11.2). 117.1 ortg would be the 2nd best in the league  All this with Trae really struggling from 3 - only 31.1% percent  When Trae and John play together they are dominating their opponents by 17.7 (!!) pts per 100. Last year they were outscored.  Individually the Hawks are +12 w Collins playing and -7 when he's not
"this is an awful look, especially after trae basically threw a temper tantrum for an entire game because john collins dared to criticize him during a film session lmao"
"I‚Äôd be very surprised if Collins has the drive and kick talent of Randle or the distribution talent of Sabonis (both are top 15 players in assists per game).   Tatum is much more ‚Äúthe 3 we sometimes play at the 4‚Äù than ‚Äúa mobile 4 that makes plays.‚Äù Siakam, similarly, only sometimes scoots up to the 4 while OG plays the bulk of their 4 minutes.   If John Collins is secretly an all-star level small forward or one of the best passing big men in the league, I‚Äôll eat 4 hard boiled eggs, but I think it‚Äôs a little too much too late for Collins to ask to be an 8-dribbles-per-possession forward. Is he that good when he puts the ball on the floor now?"
"John Collins on the Spurs would actually be the nuts, feel like he could develop into a beast there."
Jarrett Allen and John Collins both going to have some suitors come free agency.  Im hopeing the Celtics can swing a sign and trade for one of them using that Gordon Hayward TPE
"I‚Äôve only watched 2 ATL games this year but I have watched a lot of Trae in the last couple years because I love him and John Collins. I‚Äôm sure Hawks fans have way more to say. But I think the main things are the offensive load like you said and in my opinion with him he just doesn‚Äôt have great footwork, defensive instincts and size. Defense is a skill too, especially perimeter defense. When I watch Trae play I see someone who never takes the right path around screens, is never in the best position and makes the wrong gambles. He doesn‚Äôt have that timing to recover when he‚Äôs beat like a quality defender does. On top of that he‚Äôs easy to push around. Yes apathy is a problem but I don‚Äôt think just turning up the effort would solve his defense. But having all three of apathy, a massive role on offense and poor defensive skills/IQ is a recipe to be the worst defender in the league."
"They have a ton of talent. Trae Young and John Collins are all star caliber guys, Gallo/Capela/Huerter/Hunter/Cam is a stud supporting cast. That team should be significantly better than they are right now and in a normal 82 game season should be a 50 win team. It's still early but if they end the season around .500 it would be disappointing"
Would love for the Spurs to keep him. Do they have enough room to go after John Collins too?
The Spurs have enough young guards. Demar is aging and reluctant to shoot 3s  John Collins would be an amazing 2nd option on that team
Trade Milsap for John Collins?
"I agree the Capela fit is good better than I expected. Regarding Collins at the 5 here are the Hawks defensive rating by year with Collins at the 4 vs 5 via Cleaning the Glass   2018: 113.2 when he's at the 5, 109 when he's at the 4   2019: 121 when he's at the 5, 113 when he's at the 4   2020: 116 at the 5, 111.5 at the 4   2021: 110 at the 5, 100 at the 4   I think on totality defensively he's neutral/fine when at the 4 but it becomes an issue when he's at the 5. When I was talking about fit that's what I meant if you could project him as a true 5 I think he would fit alot better with other teams than trying to find a good fit with him as a 4. Like someone brought up Toronto as a potential trade destination, I dont want to be giving John Collins a max just to play him at the 4 and Siakam at the 3.   &gt;I‚Äôd be intrigued to see how we work Okongwu into the mix once he gets healthy cause he could really help cover us on defense with JC out there at the 4  Same. Also agree this offense will still be really good not worried about the past week in that sense.   &gt;I do think he‚Äôll get a max from some teams this offseaso  Agreed, one factor to monitor is the trade deadline is March 25th. Reg season ends like May 15th. If Atl is in a good spot by the deadline record wise I think you can get away with trading JC if you get a decent offer and still make the playoffs there would only be like 25 games left in the season. But let's see what happens."
It‚Äôs not a perfect way to compare but Washington so far has looked worse then his freshman year while Collins was already a 20/10 player in his sophomore year. The chances of PJ becoming John Collins isn‚Äôt high enough to pass on Collins himself.
"I honestly wouldn't mind buying him out. We didn't invest anything into getting him, just free the salary space and make a run for Gary Trent Jr or John Collins in the off-season."
"You lost me at ""great GM"" with Olshey.  He's incredibly high variance, his moves are either great or utter trash fires.  He's out of consideration given how badly the 2016 FA class went for the Blazers, I'm sorry but there's just no way that a guy who gave $200M to Moe Harkless, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner is in the conversation given the competition out there.  Also, his draft record is spotty at best, trading 3 picks to move up &amp; take Zach Collins ahead of Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, OG Anunoby and more disqualifies him."
"To paraphrase your darker counterpart, you find John Collins.  You don't pay john Collins.  Houston will facilitate though.  Give us the expirings and the picks."
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"John ""Danny Phantom"" Collins"
Very good. Plays the most minutes in the league and the Knicks are top 10 defensively all season. John Collins had like 0 points in the 4th
"John ""max contract"" Collins"
"Lloyd Pierce is holding bit of them back. I understand Trae needs to be more of a team player but giving him half of his usual touches and giving the rest to Kevin Huerter isn‚Äôt the way to do it. John Collins is a bit overrated in my opinion. However, he is a good defender and quality stretch bigs don‚Äôt grow on trees"
Alternate title: John Collins does not get max contract in free agency
"I‚Äôve watched multiple hawks games and I just don't understand the thought process of what they are trying to do. It's clearly obvious the hawks are far better when Trae is looking to be very aggressive scoring wise. Instead, he's just throwing lob's. Also, John Collins is looking overrated in my opinion absolute trash defense, zero I mean zero play making skills and commits a bunch of terrible fouls."
John Collins can't dribble the ball or pass. He needs less touches.
trade john collins already he needs touches
"Yeah probably wouldn‚Äôt play center as he wasn‚Äôt a good  rim protecter but people forget how athletic prime Dirk was, he‚Äôd have no trouble playing the 4 in today‚Äôs league..  Amare would have similar problems defensively but would be a much better version of John Collins."
But our sub tells me we are getting John Collins for Nunn + Kelly!!
"i couldn‚Äôt give half a fuck about Lauri, but even *i* know he‚Äôs better for Chicagos future than Zo. as is tradition, folks in r/chicagobulls have lost their god damn minds over someone that doesn‚Äôt move the needle whatsoever. this will age horribly, especially if John Collins isn‚Äôt a target for us."
"I actually think the Cs rotation of Theis/TT is better than every center I wrote about bar Horford. Theis is switchable and can shoot, TT is a big body who can grab boards, both are cheap. It‚Äôs the perfect combo in terms of defend/defer Cs. Issue is your offense isn‚Äôt strong enough to cover for the lack of offense from that position. IMO the ideal target would be someone like John Collins: a go-to and proven scorer. Collins has defensive limitations, but playing beside Tatum/Brown/one of the two centers should help hide them pretty well."
"Yea I actually had a really similar idea regarding John Collins. Personally I think getting John Collins would be a bigger priority than getting lonzo.  It pretty just comes down to my opinion on lauri. I don't exactly know what your stance is on lauri maybe its the same but personally I just don't see lauri as a successful long term starter for us. And I can blame his offensive inconsistencies and injuries and what not but the main reason is his defense at his position.  Power forwards who cant guard multiple positions and switch on to smaller players are just not contending level starters imo. I've seen pretty much enough of lauri to know not only can he not defend the rim or play center, but he also can't switch onto smaller guys or play the perimeter.  Collins to me offers everything lauri just doesn't. He's a very consistent scorer and player just in general. Like a legit reliable 20 and 10 guy every night and at power forward (not when he plays center lol) he's a very good defender. So kind of like a difference in strategy but like the same players. I'd rather try and trade for collins right now and then see if we can sign lonzo in the offseason. I'm also super hell bent on getting one of cade or suggs but thats more luck thana anything."
"Otto Porter I think would be very gettable and wouldnt cost enough for Danny to balk. But not sure they would want to pay as much as that would cost tax wise for this team which still likely wouldnt be good enough vs the top teams. Im probably not as high on the idea of Harrison Barnes as others for what will be the price.   Would you do Eric Gordon for that exception? $17 mil, you are gambling for sure 2 more yrs after this one on that contract but he's been good this year. He doesnt perfectly fit what they need but he would help.   John Collins is the other name I would actually legitimately consider in a trade with how he's improved on defense. Problem is he still isnt truly a 5 at the end of the day."
"What would the All Empty Calorie Team be?  Clearly:  C - Drummond  PG - Westbrook  For the rest, how about:     SF - Andrew Wiggins  PF - John Collins  SG - Zach Lavine"
"If we trading for a piece, let's go get John Collins   I know we are struggling at the 5, but I think a year worth of Drummond aint worth it especially since we are stuck in Tampa all season"
"If we are looking to trade norm and fillers, I'd rather attach a pick or two and go for John Collins then Drummond imo"
John Collins and capela
Except John Collins is better than Wiggins and Dlo ever were in there rookie contract years.
"If John Collins gets a max I think that will be a bad contract, I think he is a good player but I don‚Äôt think he is worth a max."
"I'd rather go for John Collins, at worse if he doesn't fit the guy is a really good young player that can be moved, if Vucevic gets hurt or starts playing bad we're screwed just like the Kemba situation.   we need a safe move, enough of the guys that don't match with jaylen or tatum age. just get Collins. give the Hawks 3-4 first round picks and get it done."
MPJ for John Collins and the league is actually fucked.
John Collins has more value than that. That first round pick would have to be very good.
"Yeah it's crazy that Demar and Domantas are at the same position. PF nowadays can really be anything, from a point forward like Demar to a rim finisher/shooter like John Collins, to a perimeter shot creator like Jayson Tatum."
"Randle, Harris and John Collins are all waaayyy more efficient and better than Siakam. Not sure what the love affair is with this guy. Overrated defence, super inefficient and terrible against any defence/defender that isnt bad. He is invisible against good competition."
Lauri isn't even better than thadd lmao  Also John Collins is 10x the player lauri is and I say that as a bulls fan
John Collins should be on here
Where is John Collins
I think John Collins might be a good option
"Thats fine, then he isn't going to get dealt.  Personally im not giving up Smart for a player not under contract, not sure anyone is going to give up significant assets for him when they can wait 6 months and try to get him for cash. He is not a win now player, your trade for John Collins because you think at age 26 he will be a viable top 3 player on a championship team.  Drastically reduces your potential trade pool for the player"
Derrick White for John Collins would make both teams better imo but idk if you‚Äôd get both sets of fans to agree
literally anyone other than the jays and smart for john collins
I opened a very nice pack of BBall cards yesterday and got a John Collins and a Stephen Jackson and I‚Äôm having flashbacks. Need a therapist.
evidence is in John Collins getting busted for them..you guys are nuts if you dont think he uses them..he got busted also in the miami ring bust
"Cause he's the face of the league..people say ""no way!"" but John Collins got busted like a few years ago taking them lol"
"Is that a serious offer? That‚Äôs basically a bag of chips for John Collins lol. A decent back up center, a bench warmer, and late first round picks for a potential multi-all-star"
This mans just put John Collins over Zion th.
"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"
John Collins getting maxed
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not a fan of Trae:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense
"Haven't been right, period, can't go 2 weeks without a starter being out for 6-8 weeks but even then Cam Reddish is total ass, Young is back to being swarmed every play because he's the only guy doing anything, and John Collins is about to get offered a max contract by some dumbass team despite zero evidence he can do anything outside the post"
Shoutout to our future boy John Collins for intentionally tanking his value so we can get him for cheap.
John Collins ready to dip

Man John Collins looks awful right now
Hawks fans what would it take to get John Collins? We're interested
Bojan bogdanovic for John Collins and tony snell

John Collins is a stud. I would love him as the third option in Boston.
John Collins might be the best example of this.
"Also underrated bad move is we got the 16th pick in the Butler trade. We could have got John Collins or Anunoby, but instead we drafted Patton while we had KAT and Gorgui"
"Saw his game against the mavericks, dude looked solid as hell. Far cry from the ""john collins looking depressed as hell as trae chucks a brick early in the shotclock down 7 in the 4th quarter"" version of him that I saw earlier this year."
"Oh great... another stat geek who probably hasn‚Äôt attended a single econometrics class in his life is citing a bunch catch-all stats without post estimation test results. Cool.  And RAPTOR WAR, seriously? That thing currently has FVV, Jerami Grant, and John Collins to be above Kevin Durant and Giannis btw. A really solid stat from 538.   And fyi, Booker and Lavine are ranked at exactly same spot ‚Äî 76. So going by RAPTOR WAR, if Zach and Booker were to switch teams, the Suns and the Bulls would still be at the same spot record-wise. So if the currently 15-9 Suns has Zach instead of Booker, would that make Zach an all star?"
Is John Collins better at defending than Luka? I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs actually true. They‚Äôre both about league average to slightly below.
Thurl would have extended his range to the three point line and been a rangy 4 type. Maybe John Collins type at the highest end? He was 25-47 on long 2s in his only season with tracking stats so the shooting base is there. Also had a great post game so he could score on the switch.
"The Hawks aren‚Äôt that much better. 11-13 vs 10-14. Plus, Trae has better teammates in general. John Collins is better than any big we have.   Trae‚Äôs good but he‚Äôs nowhere near as good a player as Zach"
John Collins has been flat out good on defense since spending more time at the 4 this season.
John Collins is so freaking good offensively. His only real weakness is his playmaking and defense. If he can figure out how to better help elevate guys around him he's going to be elite. It also seems like he's made some progress defensively.  It's a bummer Gallo has looked so bad so far this season. It also sounds like Atlanta needs a coaching change.

"If John Collins is a 10 on the John Collins scale, what # is Dwight Powell?"
I think he‚Äôs referring to John Collins who is actually better at defense and rebounding
"Agreed, I don‚Äôt like the way the NBA is officiated BC of the star bias. Not because of giannis‚Äôs bulldozing.   If Giannis gets that call, good for him but if John Collins the same thing and it‚Äôs not a foul then I get pissed."
"The actual play design was quite obvious, huerter missed the lob to John Collins. It definitely wasn‚Äôt designed to draw a foul lol relax"
"Yes, when Trae fucks up, I say so. But you can keep laughing. Its all good. I dont understand the hate towards Trae at all. He had 16 assists and nobody is going to talk about it. John Collins always has tremendous games against the mavs and all you hear is Luka. The one that always kills the hawks is Tim Hardawy"
If y‚Äôall just want THJ so he doesn‚Äôt hurt you anymore you can send us John Collins since he‚Äôs done a number on us his entire career

John Collins just stated his frustration over having to play with someone who rushes and jacks up shots. DLo is way worse than Young.
"Nah trade DLo in a sign and trade for John Collins. Collins wants a point guard that will work the ball around, I.e Rubio. DLo is redundant with Ant, Beasley, and Nowell."
"When the KP-to-Warriors trade rumours broke, someone on the internet proposed KP for Wiggins, Wiseman and the Minny pick.  I like KP a lot, but I would have loved that. Not that I‚Äôd expect GSW to do it. Wiseman can be kept or flipped (maybe for e.g. John Collins straight up), Wiggins will be expiring in 2023 when Mavs will be able to trade more picks and will be a large matching salary, and you can expect the Minny pick to be approximately a 5th overall pick in either 2021 or 2022, depending on when it conveys."
if John Collins could get better on defense that would be an amazing addition
"Honestly John Collins is probably the Hawks' third ""best"" player at best and fourth most important player behind Trae, Capela, and Hunter."
John Collins played those games.
He's top 5 in usage rate and has the keys to the offense. Of course he is going to rack up assists in a system like that. Is he a good leader and making his teammates better? Ask John Collins. Ask Clint Capella. The Hawks are going to do everything they can to force Trae to be the guy because they traded him for Luka. Eventually they will run out of scapegoats though.  Lou has always been a great passer and PnR player so dont even throw shade.
"2016 - Dunn over Murray 2017 - Patton over John Collins 2018 - Okogie was fine enough at 20 2019 - Culver when we could have had Herro or Washington at 11  Literally the only pick we have ""hit"" on is KAT"
"My opinion on John Collins is souring by the game, he has been less impactful than Clint by a lot."
"No John Collins is a RFA meaning his cap hit is 6 million this season, we would have to trade Malik and Rubio to get in that star salary range."
&gt;That guy doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. We need that pick due to our capped out situation. 2021 on a 3rd year and ant on a 4th year is how we can maximize the potential of this team   Yeah that's why we are trying to trade for John Collins (and probably max him) because we need to clear cap space....
"3 team trade:  Houston: Culver and a 2nd  Atlanta: Okogie, Tucker, Lottery Protected 1st (MN)  Minnesota: John Collins  This was proposed by 2 of our beat reporters on a podcast today"
"#118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that‚Äôs the MVP.   I could even argue the reasoning for his offensive numbers being so good is due to his lack of impact/effort on D. Atleast with Embiid he was doing both offence and defence at a high level so I could see his case. But jokic has no REAL case hence why lebrons ahead of him in almost every MVP race right now except the one that ranks MVP standing on pure stats."
"I take back what I said because this is a team that chose fucking TJ Leaf instead of OG Anunoby, John Collins, Kyle Kuzma, Jarrett Allen, and Josh Hart so they're gonna fuck up the lottery pick too I bet"
"I am comparing the game of basketball to the game of basketball. I'm not a Hawks fan and not a 76ers fan. As I said, Hawks over 76ers was my hot take, and I gave reasons to back it up. You may disagree and that is your prerogative. I have great respect for Embiid but I have seen Capela is the only defender in the league who can stop him. Matchups mean everything. Reddish is a good enough perimeter defender to limit Curry's scoring and 76ers dont have anyone to stop Collins. I think it would be a very even series and would most likely come down to how well Tobias Harris plays and how well John Collins plays"
"LOL if I must.   #118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that‚Äôs the MVP."
"It does seem like there is at least a possibility that John Collins gets moved. However, I'm not sure it would be for a ""haul"" of picks -- the rumored asking price is a high lottery pick. Minnesota has been named as having have the most interest at this point."
Aaron Gordon spinning mascot. Or John Collins demolishing a paper mache plane
"I thought it might be Jamal Crawford, my first thought was John Collins but he wouldnt make sense in context. Then i thought of Tony Snell because he is basically Jesus Christ but man it just gets confusing ya know?"
"Jamal Crawford I'm guessing since they mentioned Lou Will but honestly, this comparison is so off base it could be John Collins and it would make just as much sense."
"I disagree. You have dudes like Giannis, Tobias Harris, Zion, AD (who spends more minutes at power forward than center by far), Bam sometimes, John Collins, Lauri Markannen, Draymond Green, Jerami Grant.  I get your argument about there not being a ton of natural power forwards, but i'd just argue the skill sets for that position has just improved to the point where theyre more capable of doing things like guarding wing players or big men. Lots of these dudes still get buckets in the paint and are athletic, but many also shoot or playmake."
"The ideal NBA lineup nowdays is a guard, a big and 3-wings but I still feel like the position of power forward holds weight in the modern NBA.  Tweeners still exist between PF/C - there's some bigger players that are slow enough to where they can't guard the 3 or not big enough to guard the 5. Giannis and Tobias come to mind, as does John Collins.   Also plenty of older 3's who have lost some of their athleticism have moved over to the 4 to guard slower guys now (i.e. Marcus Morris).  That being said, if you can't shoot you'll most likely be run off the floor unless you bring some other major talents (i.e. Giannis)."
"How can you say that when Giannis, AD, Zion, Randle are here? Then there‚Äôs guys like Siakam, John Collins, Jonathan Isaac (when he was healthy, Jaren Jackson Junior at the next tier  Notice how diverse their skill sets are, it‚Äôs not your traditional post up 6‚Äô10 6‚Äô11 guys on the block anymore, because the game shifted away from that toward spacing, ability to switch and defend in open space and recover, speed and versatile matters more on both ends, if anything it‚Äôs the birth of new era versatile Forwards."
"sabonis, zion, randle, jaren jackson jr, john collins are all natural power forwards imo"
Lol hawks FO aren't dropping off John Collins for Taurean prince and a shitty pick. They aren't gonna get finessed so badly.
Why don't the Hawks just donate John Collins to the children's hospital
No I'm arguing that the Wolves need help on the wing way more than they need another PF especially if that power forward is John Collins.
"Pop chose Derrick White over Trae and Kuzma, Bagley (missed cut at later point), and Plumlee over John Collins and Adabayo. They didn‚Äôt make sense at the time either."
"Didn't there were rumors earlier about John Collins to Minny? Well both have the same value pretty much, I doubt Minny wanna give a first away again like the DLo trade"
To have that level of desire for John Collins is so very Timberwolves.
lol John Collins does not have attitude issues.
"I understand if people don't like her bc she's biased with Kyrie or Celtics stuff, but John Collins trade rumors are really not a thing someone who has covered league for decades is using to get fame or plays on a podcast.   Her being wrong about Lakers defense has nothing to do with her intel on John Collins that has already been reported by local Timberwolves guys or Shams."
why would she (or anybody that's already established in NBA media) make up John Collins/Timberwolves trade rumors
Of those bunch only John Collins is worth a future 1st round draft pick IMO
I personally do not think he has max contract type potential plus he has reported attitude issues. Like I mean I understand why John Collins might be a good idea but I personally don't want anything to do with him right now.
Play wise? Yeah probably. But if you trade for John Collins you probably wanna re-sign him and you know some random team will offer him the max and you'll have to match it to retain him. And I don't wanna be the team that is stuck with John Collins on a max contract for 4 years.
John Collins???? He‚Äôs worth more than a first
"I wouldn't trade a first for Oladipo, Mills or John Collins but the rest sure"
"I wouldn't trade a first for Oladipo, Mills or John Collins but the rest sure"
Atlanta fans what's up with John Collins? Remember him being a beast last season
"John ""PEDS"" Collins"
I mean there‚Äôs a reason 72% of John Collins shots come off zero dribbles lol
I don‚Äôt really understand why the Knicks would be interested in John Collins
&gt;Teams do not leave their center defending the rim while vuc stands on the perimeter. Just doesnt happen.  They help off him all the time. You can spend 5 min watching every 3 pointer he's taken this year and see this. [Here you go even enjoy](https://go.nba.com/i7kf). Just because they dont treat you like Ben Simmons playing 10 feet off you doesnt mean you provide floor spacing.   Ill give you his most recent game as an ex   [Blatantly treating him as a guy they are willing to let shoot no actual gravity](https://go.nba.com/sk18)   Same thing [Michael Carter Williams isnt nearly this big a threat on a drive to warrant this kind of attention they are just sagging off Vuc and letting him shoot because they dont care if he does](https://go.nba.com/nj95)  [transition 3 Collins closes out in the end but not exactly playing up on him like you see guys with real gravity get defended](https://go.nba.com/n4fc). Same idea as before [MCW driving in transition isnt nearly a big enough threat bigs have to be ready in the paint](https://go.nba.com/o1n2) coaching instructions are clearly close out if he does shoot it but that they arent afraid to let him shoot if he wants.   Not much to evaluate here [just a scramble type situaiton spot up 3 opening for Vuc](https://go.nba.com/yk4c)  And his last [3 pointer for that game same idea zero gravity just let him shoot](https://go.nba.com/eord). If he had actual gravity John Collins would be rotating off Aminu to prevent a Vuc shot and let Aminu shoot but he doesnt.   I picked this most recent game. You can pick whatever you want youll see the same point. The vast majority of the time he doesnt have gravity and cause defenses to bend or really respect his shot.
Bleacher Report and trade John Collins for a g-leaguer and a 2nd round pick
"Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, probably could get some guys from the Rockets(Gordon, Tucker, Oladipo, maybe Wood would be available), Pacers(Brogdon &amp; Myles Turner), Demar Derozan, Aaron Gordon, John Collins, Kevin Love &amp; another piece from Cavs. Lotta help out there."
"Trae's best teammate in his first season was 21 year old John Collins.  LaMelo has Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward as vets and a few good young players in Monk and Graham and Washington.  Not saying Trae was better as a rookie, but LaMelo is much better positioned to contribute from a supporting cast perspective."
"When basic stats don't support your point, call them empty box score stats.  The man is third in the freaking league in assists. That means something for how much he improves the offense, no matter how much you want to try dismiss it. This is with a half-injured team of rookies/sophomores + John Collins and Clint Capela."
Didnt him and John Collins just get into it because Collins called Trae out? Or am I wrong?
"They'll have to outprice Portland. A lot of teams want high end young talent on their roster at any cost, teams have cap situations where adding talent is more important than maintaining future cap space, some with owners who don't mind luxury tax. I see GTJ and John Collins getting getting 25+, hell even lozno probably around that too. Especially since there's no great free agents this offseason"
I dunno but I'm gonna blame John Collins
"Usually its not a situation where Team A trades say picks 17 and 20 to Team B for pick 12.  Because like you said, Team B would rather just have the shot at the better player  But what you can do is trade 17 and 20 to get maybe a promising young player whos going to be a restricted free agent that Team B doesn't want to pay.  Malik Beasley for example when the Nuggets were looking to trade him last year.  Or like this season with the Hawks trying to trade John Collins.   That's just an example, but theres many things you can do with non-lottery first rd picks to improve your teams outlook"
We'll if he would utilize the beast that John Collins is maybe he would have more open looks
What about John Collins?   Can stretch the floor at least and play with AD/Gasol. I don't think Atlanta is gonna pay for him anyway. And I think Trez might do well in ATL
&gt;With john collins looking like hes done with atlanta  What gives you this impression OP
Pray for John Collins
2007 after John Amaechi came out.  He‚Äôs flipped and become an ally/better person. He was among the first to call and congratulate Jason Collins and has worked with GLAAD.
"He's probably gone at the end of the season but it makes absolutely no sense to deal Lowry for anything other than a high-value FRP or a reliable center, which no contender would be willing/able to deal.   Better to make a playoff run and maintain a solid FA destination status for the next couple of seasons, maybe deal Powell for a Myles Turner/John Collins."
"Honestly, if any of the bubble contender teams get Voochi Mane, they are instant contenders in my eyes... Vooch is fucking *nuts* and I would commit some crimes for him to be on the hawks... Like I'm in love John Collins and Clint Capela but I would trade almost anyone for a Vooch + trae pairing."
"John Collins comes back after being out for a few weeks, Hunter seemingly coming back in the not too distant future. Then both Trae and Capella, our two most important players, get hurt in the same game. Nice."
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
"No to all of the above.  Imo the real question is do you take Ingram over Julius Randle, John Collins, Gordon Hayward..."
Yeah and John Collins
I think John Collins is very underrated but at the same time i also think Trae basically gift him 10-14 points every game.
"Eliminating the Nuggets from playoff contention, giving them a lottery pick they might have missed otherwise, as they won their last two games. I believe Portland held the tiebreaker over Denver, but Portland also could have easily lost to San Antonio the next night - as it stands they only won by 1 point.  In 2017 draft, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell with their lottery pick. Various advanced stats place Mitchell as the 2nd to 4th best player from that draft so far. Portland, meanwhile, won just as many playoff games as Denver that year, but ended up with Justin Jackson, who has had a rather lackluster career thus far.  The only players of roughly similar value to Mitchell picked after him are Bam Adebayo (who was picked by the late-lottery Heat and thus unavailable to any playoff team), John Collins, and Jarrett Allen.  Westbrook's 35 foot dagger was a building block in the future of the Nuggets."
John Collins is so much better than Porzingis and it seems like they gonna try and keep him now
"Porzingis is a perimeter oriented player, his game fits better on the outside. John Collins is a primary roll man. He can hit the three decently well, but not on high attempts per game. The FO has been clear that they don't want to pay JC, not that they don't want to pay anyone. I tried to think up a scenario where theres a player who might fit well that they might consider. I don't know why you think I'm blind, the paint clogging has been an issue all season..."
"JC and Trae both play off of each other so well. JC is shooting a higher % from 3 than KP this season (admittedly, on less attempts). John Collins is a better lob threat, is more athletic, is still improving and has proven he can coexist well with Clint. He is also younger than KP. Why would we ever in a million years want to do this?"
"While JC has improved a lot defensively the important part of KP‚Äôs defence is his rim protection, which john Collins still struggles with. Collins can move his feet and stay in front of his man, but I‚Äôd agree that what they lose in rum protection they‚Äôd gain in rebounding and athleticism. This trade really might be a win win"
There was some before the season for sure but once John Collins was out that faded very quickly
Here is the full list updated on the season:  Julius Randle: 7/22  Kyrie Irving: 4/14  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5/13  Devin Booker: 3/11  Steph Curry: 1/5  LeBron James: 2/8  Bradley Beal: 1/7  Domantas Sabonis: 2/6  Jayson Tatum: 2/6  Jaylen Brown: 2/6  John Collins: 1/7  DeAaron Fox: 1/6
Miles turner or John Collins would be the absolute best type of big to pair with Bam. Long shots though lol
"He‚Äôs the only reason the hawks aren‚Äôt the 30th worst defense in a starting lineup with trae young, bogdon bogdonavich, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon hill. Not to mention atrocious defenders like Lou Williams and gallinari and a mediocre guy like John Collins. Capela is a monster at protecting the rim while bam isn‚Äôt, which is by far the most important part of center defense."
"Bam guards 1-5 too and did it the entire playoffs last year.   Bam this szn against teams best players:  Lebron: 2/8 25%  Jaylen brown: 4-14 28%  Julius randle: 7-18 39%  Brad beal: 1-7 14%  Giannis: 5-13 38%  Sabonis: 1-5 20%  John collins: 1-7 14%  He has multiple game winning blocks this year as well, and hes now 3 or 4 in dpoy ranking. Idk why only now is he getting put into the conversation"
"Lonzo, John Collins, Kawhi"
"Again it‚Äôs way too early to say it was a mistake. You saying that the heat doesn‚Äôt regret picking Bam just furthers my point. As a rookie, John Collins was much better than bam, averaging better stats and was even named to all rookie second team while bam was not. Bam was selected at 14 and john Collins was picked at 19. Many ppl were saying heat would‚Äôve been better if they picked Collins and they messed up sorta like how ppl are talking about Lamelo and wiseman. Now look at it. Heat fans have absolutely zero regrets and they know they made the right choice. Not saying that Collins is bad, he‚Äôs very good, but bam is better now. Just goes to show calling rookie picks mistakes with like 30 games is way too early"
"Grant is pretty important come playoff time for the undersized big / oversized wings that every team carries.  His defense on guys like siakam, AGordon, Bam, John Collins is important for the Celtics who don‚Äôt really have anyone who can stand up to those guys."
"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
"Beal is the dream but it probably won‚Äôt happen.  Gordon Hayward, Christian Wood, one of Turner/Sabonis, S&amp;T for John Collins, maybe Issac (also unlikely I think)?  If I were a GM I‚Äôd really want Wiseman but it might be hard to find a perfect match"
"John Collins could still get a max, right?"
"John Collins also had 22 ppg on .660 true shooting, but he only played 41 of the 67 games last year so I‚Äôm assuming he didn‚Äôt play enough to meet the requirements"
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
"If you guys can get Mobley, I‚Äôd trade Bagley the same day for literally anything. Would be cool to try and get Monk or maybe John Collins in a s&amp;t"
I mean our entire core is john collins age or younger. Unless you think none of these players will improve at all then we will be better the next couple of years.
Yeah but we were leading in the second half before you guys went on your run. If we have our perimeter defenders and John Collins that run doesn‚Äôt happen
"I feel like the end score isn't the whole story. Whenever the Bucks turned it on, they got whatever they wanted, on both ends. Hawks just didn't have that switch.   John Collins def could've helped y'all with the rebounding though. That play in crunch time when Bucks got 4 offensive rebounds was killer."
Foul baiter üò° üò° üò° üò° üò°   Thats not basketball  I dont watch hawks games lol but I know that trae draws foul everwy play and he is bad leader becuase my friend told me that he called john collins a meanie and now they dont wike each udder.
We desperately need a big that can shoot. Ideally that would be John Collins but I doubt the hawks let him leave. So that basically just leaves Markkanen
"You put Cade in the best position to succeed. Make Garland and Sexton both available and trade the one you get the best offer for. See if there's a way you can get a young big (go hard after John Collins) and depth that has played in a structured system (try to get guys like Georges Niang, Jarrell Brantley, Furkan Korkmaz, Monte Morris, Semi Ojeleye). Prey on teams that might be looking to shed salary around the margins to go after FAs or cut their luxury tax bills.   In short, go all-in on Cade and surround him with players that aren't going to be the problem. Also, you need a new coach, someone like Charles Lee. Hire him."
Trae and John Collins
"And John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Kris Dunn"
John Collins as well
john collins and clint capela
" Yeah, Obi Toppin pretty much did 2 things for the first half of the season, either spotting up from the corner or flashing out above the arc in a double staggered ball screen. Neither are really his strengths, so he hasn't been used the right way this season. If we actually played him like a John Collins, DeAndre Jordan, or just about any other actual athletic rim runner, he'd be dropping jaws with how often he exerts his physicality over others. But right now, Thibs is using him like a spot up shooter."
John Collins
"y‚Äôall sleepin on john collins n brad beal , they cuties"
"I think a lot of people are underestimating the impact John Collins is having on the defensive end, he‚Äôs clamping down Randle every single time."
Not even John Collins. Randle was getting clamped by Gallinari lmao.
Paying John Collins Porzingis money fixed 0 of the issues
"dude learning the way of the playoffs defense. it's painfully clear that Rose and Taj are the only ones on the team that know how to deal with the playoffs pressure. Also Randle needs some level of space, and John Collins is a very good matchup."
John Collins Sign+Trade is probably the best value they got KP right now. His stock is way too low
Idk why everyone keeps saying the hawks won‚Äôt shoot wide open shots this good again...if the shots are taken away then the Knicks are guarding trae 1 on 1 and they get torched for 30+...and if the hawks go on a stretch with John Collins at C again it‚Äôs 5 out with 5 shooters...the problem is the knicks team was built and defense and they can‚Äôt defend the hawks...their offense was never actually good
Mavs need to send KP somewhere else   And try to land John Collins
"I don't see how you could hold any of it against him when he drops 30 on over 50% shooting with 7 assists while John Collins is in foul trouble all game and only manages 15 minutes, Bogdanovic goes 2-13 from 3, and Gallo goes 2-9 from 3.   It was miraculous that Trae might've been able to win them the game if his coach had let him play more."
"Mavs should keep THJ, trade KP and sign John Collins"
Sign John Collins
"What you‚Äôve seen of john collins these playoffs besides the damn near endless fouling he‚Äôs doing is usually how he is. he‚Äôs not a bad defender but under Lloyd we were very bad defensively i‚Äôd say, which is when we lost our first 2 games to you guys."

John Collins is so bad
Idk John Collins hasn't been much better for the hawks
John Collins talking a lot of trash for a scrub that fouls out in 14 mins lmaoooooo
John Collins is an offensive monster
"OHHHH so the refs just said ""no you're not allowed to steal the ball from John Collins"" gotcha"
Did John Collins ruin a good series? He complains about fouls refs double down and call everything. It's not a fun watch right now
"john collins is a bigger JR smith.  great talent, great athleticism, not great BB IQ."
"John Collins is elite level trash. I hope to god we don't max this loser. At best, sign and trade, otherwise let this turd walk"
Sorry but John Collins doesn't deserve a max
John Collins looks like a Mega Jordan Poole
"Me and John Collins scored the same in Game 2, I knew I could be an NBA player one day!"
So realistically... how much is some team gonna over pay John Collins this offseason?
John Collins
You don't know who John Collins is?
John collins already has more points than he did last game
"John Collins hasn't been playing well, but believe whatever you want. We're used to being the underdogs."
Hell naw. If John collins can score more than zero points and Gallo can find his shot again it‚Äôll go the hawks way.
INB4 they give John Collins a max and get even worse defensively
Didn't they really want John Collins around the trade deadline? Maybe they want him
"The Pacers got significantly worse after firing him and the Hawks had the best record in the NBA after hiring him. People are being pretty silly acting like McMillan not putting Trae back in was the biggest issue with that game when John Collins had 5 fouls in 10 minutes, Bogdanovic went 2-13 from 3, and Gallinari went 2-10 from the field, 2-9 from 3.   It's hard to win games when pretty much all your key players besides Trae are off. Trae might've been able to save the game if McMillan had put him back in sooner, but the amount of shit you have to ignore to blame it all on rotations is ridiculous."
"Tl;dr: No I‚Äôm not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team‚Äôs health that didn‚Äôt end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami‚Äôs probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There‚Äôs actually a ton more reasons I‚Äôm very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I‚Äôm happy to share if you‚Äôre interested though."
"Isn't Kawhi the only big star who could be a free agent?  I guess there's CP3 but he's 36.   Other than that it's like Lowry, DeRozan, Conley, Schroder...  Or throwing a max offer sheet at John Collins."
"Future Sacramento King, John Collins had 0 points, 2 rebounds, 0 assists, 5 fouls on 15 minutes and this man has the audacity to bitch about the refs? How soft is everyone on this Hawks team outside of Trae?"
"John Collins is gonna foul out because of this, would be typical Atlanta sports for that to happen"
"This is a really great summary, and I hope we get to see as much out of these two teams as we can.   That being said, as much as you can say the Knicks will be tougher to beat once Randle starts to get it together, the same could be said for John Collins. He was our second leading scorer this season, and he has a TOTAL of 12 points and 9 rebounds through 2 games. He was entirely absent last night due to his foul trouble."
oof what happened to John Collins?
"&gt;Here‚Äôs the thing, you‚Äôve just listed a bunch of averages at me and no one actually shoots their average consistently, it‚Äôs like how Lebrons career average is 27/7/7 but he never records that. Shit fluctuates.  No shit. I'm not saying they hit their season averages exactly every game, but they have 5 players on their roster who hit 40% from 3 on the season. That means they're good 3 point shooters (all ranked in the top 70 of NBA players on the season), but they went 4/26. Julius Randle averaged 24 ppg this season. He had an uncharacteristically bad game 1, so it was easy to see a bounce back in game 2. That doesn't mean he's going to score exactly 24 points, but game 1 he was unlucky. He was missing shots he'd made all year.  &gt;Most of your players hit above their average last game.  I'm not a Hawks fan.  &gt;if you expect consistent from a young inexperienced team idk what to tell you.  The players I'm talking about are Gallinari, who is 32 and in his 12th NBA season. Bogdanovic, who is 28 and in his 4th NBA season. Tony Snell, who is 29 and in his 8th NBA season. Lou Williams, who is 34 and in his 16th NBA season. And John Collins, who is 23 and in his 4th NBA season."
Draymond for John Collins S+T who says no?
Did John Collins get injured? Why did he only play 15 minutes? I didn‚Äôt watch the game.
Probably not statiscally but 6‚Äô1 180 isn‚Äôt that crazy at all. Looking at someone at that height is like looking at another regular guy. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs Clint capela or John Collins they talking shit to
I don‚Äôt know how anyone could watch this game and think John Collins is a starter.
"&gt;I didn‚Äôt realize your team had multiple role players shooting 100% on wide open threes this season  Nice job being intentionally stupid. No one is saying the Hawks players shoot 100% from 3, but it's an absolute objective fact that 4 of their best shooters had terrible shooting nights from 3pt range.   John Collins shot 40% on the season and made 0/2 tonight for 0%.  Gallinari shot 41% on the season and made 2/9 tonight for 22%.   Bogdanovic shot 44% on the season and made 2/13 tonight for 15%.   Tony Snell shot 57% on the season and made 0/2 tonight for 0%.   Even if all of them shot 10% below their season average that's an expected point output of 26, but in the game itself they ended with 12. 14 points would have been the difference in the game. Unfortunately for the Hawks their 4 best 3pt shooters by % all had terrible games. Sometimes that happens, but it IS unlucky."
lmfao i totally didn‚Äôt even want to believe john collins stat line was real wtf
"We got back into the game in the short stretch where Trae was a little gassed in the 3rd/got taken out in the late 3rd, if the Hawks depth and John Collins don't step up it'll hurt the Hawks  That being said Collins also got in EARLY foul trouble so I'm not sure if this game is a realistic expectation for the rotations going forward"
What happened to John Collins?
"What was wrong with his rotations? Didn't watch  Also, wtf happened to John Collins?"
Abysmal game from John Collins. Only 14 mins?
Do Hawks not run anything for John Collins??
Damn wasn't John Collins supposed to be the second Hawks stars? 0/2 for 0 pts with 2 Rebs. That's embarassing
And Bogi? Not to mention John Collins literally had 0 points tonight. Like I said good luck having the planets align like that again
John Collins was a straight up bum in this game. So was Gallo.
Did John Collins play today?
Holy John Collins got 5 fouls in 14 minutes? Was he smacking players every defensive possession?
"We should rather focus on John Collins getting benched for being unplayable. Bogi was cold from 3 tonight but without him and Trae Atlanta struggled mightily in terms of playmaking.  He didn't play poorly, he was just ice-cold unfortunately."
"Rose's a bully. ROSE'S A FUCKING BULLY! ALL YOU FUCKIN KNICK HATERS? SUCK MY DICK! WATCH AND LEARN. WE GOT A NEW TEAM NIüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èA. ALL THAT SHIT Y'ALL WAS TALKING ABOUT WE GONNA GET SWEPT?

what happend to john collins guys? whys he only hve 15? forreal question
I never watch Hawk games. Can somebody tell me what happened to John Collins? I thought he was pretty solid
What John Collins took steroids for? Cardio?
I know it's on John Collins for fouling... But Holy shit refs... You've completely taken him out of the game. Absolutely bullshit   With that being said... Go Knicks and go Rose
John collins has 0 points and 5 fouls and he wants a max contract he can go fuck himself lol. He obviously heard what Davis Bertans did tonight
man i'm torn between glee and pity as a John Collins fan
what's gonna be for John Collins next season? is he gonna be back to ATL?
I pity the team that offers John Collins the max
Is John Collins out and not playing ?
Shoulda seen the ref set the pick on the Knicks D. Almost as stiff as John Collins shoe.
Did John Collins get injured?
John Collins got in early foul trouble
John Collins in foul trouble does not bode well for Atlanta...
John Collins getting 2 ‚Äúfouls‚Äù (super soft calls) on the 1st 2 minutes will kill the hawks
"John Collins stands still. Two fouls. Entire Knicks teams slaps a hawks player, nothing"
"68.7% would put him at 94th of qualifying players. And 25 guys take more of their shots from within three feet than Simmons‚Äô 52.7% and the only ones who shoot worse than him are Eubanks, Thanasis, Precious, Howard, and Capela. Howard is 2.2% less efficient shooting 14.3% more of his shots from there while Capela shoots .3% worse with 18.2% more of his shots from there.  Also Simmons can take a far higher percentage of his own shots within 3 feet without having that much higher a volume compared to other players. Bballref doesn‚Äôt offer the numbers of attempts for that exact range but we can look at the numbers for restricted area shooting to get an idea.  There are a number of guys (Sabonis, Kanter, JV, Ayton, Gobert, Capela among others) who have both a higher number of field goals and higher percentage than Simmons‚Äô 4.1 makes on 65.7% from the restricted area.  Guys with less than one fewer make per game on higher percentages include:  Butler‚Äôs 4 a game on 67.4% Bam‚Äôs 3.9 a game on 74.9% Fox‚Äôs 3.9 a game on 68.9% Tatum‚Äôs 3.5 a game on 68.1% Jaylen Brown‚Äôs 3.4 on 67.8% John Collins‚Äô 3.4 on 72.6% Thad Young‚Äôs 3.4 on 67% Bagley‚Äôs 3.4 on 67% Doug McDermott‚Äôs 3.2 on 69.5%"
Don‚Äôt think John Collins is best buds with Trae..
"That‚Äôs some stupid shit. I get kawhi staring him down. But what did PG do there? What did fucking Morris do?   Trae made a game winner and he was the one to tell the arena to be quiet, not John Collins or bogdan or Clint.  They‚Äôre just an unlikable team. Most of these negative comments towards the clippers are coming from fans of other teams, not just the Lakers."
The Hawks have drafted exceptionally well with the 19th pick in the past. We drafted Jeff Teague who was technically an all-star at 19. We picked John Collins an efficient 20-10 guy and possible future all-star at 19. We picked Kevin Huerter a reliable starter/6th man jack-of-all-trades at 19.  Naturally this means we're probably getting the 20th pick this year.
"They did, just Harkless and Aminu were backup caliber forwards playing 30 minutes a game.  Portland just didn't have the supporting shooting or playmaking in 2018.  He followed that really poor performance up with a run to the WCF despite having a frontcourt of injured and fasting Kanter + Harkless and Aminu.    He's a solid coach.  Not elite, but unless Spo is willing to return to Portland I'm not sure if Portland can lure anyone better.    The issue, more than anything, is Olshey's roster construction and drafting.  We have 2 forwards and one of them is Melo.  We absolutely blew the 2017 draft where we had 3 first rounders and walked away with Zach Collins and Swanigan.  Hindsight is 2020, but there is a world where Portland could have had Donovan Mitchell and Kuzma from that draft, or if we didn't trade up John Collins, OG Anunoby/Jerrett Allen, and Kuzma/White/Hart.  I'm not even convinced we needed to trade up for Zach Collins.  That offseason where we dumped money on Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner was also a disaster."
"well the only reason that John Collins lost his shoe is Taj Gibson tackling him. Or like JC put it himself: [""Shoe off I didn't give a fuck""](https://streamable.com/vgtv4z)"
John Collins and OKC 1st
So that‚Äôs why John Collins was just open and Trae didn‚Äôt pass lmao
"Lol that‚Äôs not our ceiling but I think what could be a pretty reasonable expectation for us. And we aren‚Äôt beating anyone out by paying a fair price, but we have so much space we can afford to do something like give John Collins max money, something I don‚Äôt know for sure if other teams would be willing to do.  Cade/Shai would be maybe a top 5 backcourt in the league pretty quickly if Cade lives up to half the hype he had."
I mean if we get picks 1 and 5 I bet we are no more than 1-2 years away from being a play in team if not better. We also have a ton of cap space we could use to overpay someone youngish like John Collins or Lonzo or whoever.
No wonder John Collins wants out
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
"Pretty good start.  I could tell some of the guys were getting quite emotional.  First time all season playing  with that many fans in the building too.  The local broadcast interviewed John Collins after the game and he was hyped but you could tell he was also a bit emotionaly drained.  This was the first playoff game for John, FYI.  Will be interesting seeing them grow through this experience."
"Honestly I‚Äôm just happy to be in the playoffs, but after that game I am just super hyped on this team. Our oldest starter is Bodgan at 28 but we‚Äôre playing without Cam Reddish. Trae is only 22, and John Collins is 23. There‚Äôs not been a brighter moment in Hawks basketball that I can remember."
John Collins and he was begging for the ball too.  Would have missed.
I just love John Collins
[Source Tweet from Chouinard](https://twitter.com/KLChouinard/status/1396660504123297795)  Picture of John Collins shoe at [the top of key setting a screen on Taj](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2HjDlWWEAI9jaO?format=jpg&amp;name=large)
"John Collins went 17th overall in that draft. One heck of a way to kick start a rebuild, IMO."
John Collins
Well John Collins is right there to hook him up with the sauce.
Meanwhile John Collins standing there with his arms up wanting to take the last shot with only one shoe on
John Collins looks like a teller version of Danny Green.
Hawks don‚Äôt get John Collins involved enough
"John Collins to the Hawks: ""Fuck you, pay me"""
Amazing what can happen when John Collins actually decides to play basketball
AG was supposed to do what John Collins is doing for the hawks fuck man
JOHN COLLINS THE FINISHER
John collins got a pogo stick
JOHN COLLINS
Why you gotta use last resort methods like that on John fucking Collins goddamn Ben
John Collins got to tip the camera man extra what a great angle.
"That was a gorgeous dunk, I love John Collins' game!"
JOHN COLLINS FROM THE RAFTERS    What a call
John Collins is alive?? What.
John Collins tryna get PAID
John Collins without Trae passing to him plays on Olympiakos by now btw
John Collins is pulling a Dennis Schroeder. They both prove the theory that too many players are asking for max contacts.
"Neither. John Collins was the 19th pick of his draft.  He‚Äôs way underperforming lately, which surprises me because I‚Äôm really high on him."
"John Collins really pulled out the ""i want a max deal"" card and decided to play like this during his contract year jesus"
He deserves some of the money that‚Äôs probably going to the bum John Collins
Collins? Collins? John Collins? Class has anyone seen John Collins today?
John Collins really wants a max contract to catch lobs lmao
Would not wanna be the team the gives John Collins the money he is looking for
Is this the same John Collins that wanted a max?
"John Collins, welcome to Sacramento!"
john collins is absolutely useless..
john collins playing in china next year
Remember when people thought John Collins was good? ü§°
Trae 0/5  John Collins 0/5  Hawks Bench 0/7
"Future Sacramento King, John Collins."
Lets all laugh at John Collins for thinking he's a max player
Some foolish team is going to give John Collins way too much fucking money very soon  I‚Äôm already shaking my head
I wonder what will happens with john Collins if the hawks lose
How is John Collins 0-5 already lol
John collins missed alley-oop was the worst
I feel so bad to whoever overpays John Collins
John collins missed a freebie dunk as i type this
John Collins gonna be catching lobs from Jimmer Fredette in Shanghai in 2 years
John Collins is just not worth what he thinks he is.
So John Collins about that max...
John Collins a two-pack of ass fr
John Collins. Just wow man
abolish john collins
John Collins you are going to hell before you get a max contract in this league
"Luka isn‚Äôt going anywhere any time soon, but this situation might affect the Mavs‚Äô urgency in putting a true winner around Luka. If they fear that continuing as they are will just continue to alienate Luka, they might make some big moves to try to appease him (something like giving up assets to get rid of Porzingis and open space to make a big offer to John Collins)."
John collins and Hardaway is my guess.  Collins will get the max or close to it and hardaway might get 25+ per.  More than 6 teams can have max cap space and there likely wont be anyone to spend it on.    Kawhi &amp; CP3 will likely re-sign with their teams.  Lowry is interesting target.  Both he and CP3 fall under the over 38 rule - so their next contract will likely be 3 year deals.  ( Over 38 rule makes the 4th year salary prorated into the first 3 years )
"Giannis, Jaylen Brown, John Collins"
John Collins.
I honestly wouldn't do anything crazy.  they have some good young talent and are in the same age range.  they aren't going to be a contender right away so keep building the team.  adding a veteran on the wrong side of 30 wont change this team much.  Bagley is the big question so maybe see what Atlanta wants for John collins.  fox will be wanted if you want to hand the team to Haliburton so there could be trade options down the road
"I think they should draft Moses moody, a great 3&amp;D prospect, trade Bagley for picks, try and sign Jarrett Allen but if they can‚Äôt resign Holmes and go for Makeennen or Collins   If they could sign Allen I see them as a very formidable young core with improved defense   G Fox  G Halliburton  F Moody DRAFT F James Johnson FA  C Allen FA  6th Man: Buddy Heild  If u can‚Äôt sign Allen go for a John Collins or markennen or try and resign Richaun Holmes"
"If he has a good game 1 next season, he's for sure getting the Ayton/John Collins treatment."
Maybe John Collins isn‚Äôt as good as you think he is
John Collins
"John Collins, Reddish/hunter and all the picks and pick swaps ATL has"
"They were cheering the injury. People from within the arena tweeted about it, a hawk fan came into the game thread apologizing for it, and John Collins was spotted shushing some of the fans."
John Collins is so exploitable in this series.. I feel bad for whoever pays him big money
Everyone says Embiid gets all the calls but what about John Collins?
John Collins talks an immense amount of shit for an extremely average basketball player
I never know what to make of John Collins as a player. High caliber roleplayer? He‚Äôs confusing.
They said ‚ÄòJohn Collins was not able to establish legal guarding position‚Ä¶. Knee to knee contact results in defensive foul cause not in legal guarding position‚Äô
One of John Collins legs in front of him
"John Collins scoring in trash time, he's ready to play for the Orlando Magic"
So there is talk of John Collins getting a max?
Haha nah I was joking because ever broadcast they talk about John Collins and some gas station he goes to
John Collins fumbled the bag
"I just need to say this one more time. John Collins wants a max contract. You not Rasheed Wallace bruh, you good for 13 and 6 a night and that 6 is turnovers and blow byes . Trash ass"
They better not give John Collins the max or imma fucking lose it. Someone else can overpay him. Also the 6ers should really sit Embiid for the rest of the game. This was my main concern with him playing so much in the first 2 games. Did he just bang knees with someone?
At this point I don't think John Collins is even worthy of 90m
John Collins not getting any max
John Collins defense is ü§¢
"Give John Collins the max, please"
"If hawks don't shoot lights out every game they lose. John collins has been really disappointing. Idk what he's going to command in the offseason, but he's definitely lost a lot of money"
And John Collins wants a max? Lmao fuck outta here bruh
I don't count on the refs on doing anything so I'm sorry but I can't entertain this. Especially since John Collins has only 8 points. That's awful.
"For the love of everything good in this world Falcons, PLEASE sign John Collins to replace Julio Jones as a WR. Dude has immaculate hands and can hop out of the building.  No but seriously some of the catches he makes just blow my mind."
"FT stuff is in Ben's head bad, there was a game last yr Simmons dropped 30 just barreling through John Collins every time and doing whatever he wanted. Now cant even take a shot when he's right under the rim vs him"
I appreciate Star duos that didn‚Äôt get along but put aside their differences. Trae and John Collins weren‚Äôt always keen on each other right? Donovan and Gobert too if I recall.
"This thread has become the ""John Collins isn't worth the minimum"" circle jerk lol"
I am thankful every time I see John Collins in the game that guy is hot garbage
John Collins is barely worth the contract the hawks offered him
This series is over if John Collins can't put it together
john collins is a 6'9 Jr smith.   Pure talent - check  great athleticism - check  really low BBIQ - check
How does John Collins want a max
What the fuck is John Collins doin. He looks so lost üòÇ
John Collins is soft
"Lmao, John Collins had to get yelled at by Trae Young to try a simple pass to the wing, then fucked it up and looked at Trae like it was somehow his fault"
Lol John Collins so hesitant
John Collins is a reliable regular season player and a great personality but no way he's worth more than 80 mil for 4 years.
Looks like a correct decision for ATL not to max John Collins last offseason.
Put John Collins as center?
John Collins trying to dribble
this mans john collins really wants a max lmaoo
"Once again, John Collins you are going to hell before you get a max contract"
Lmfao Ben Simmons has John Collins on him and can‚Äôt attack him.
The really squeezing the towel on that gas station story about John Collins.
I feel like John Collins is going to go off tonight
"Unrelated but may I please join the Hawks for the playoffs? Trae is electric and I‚Äôm frustrated that the Hawks have made great moves while the Mavericks fucking haven‚Äôt. We got the two best players of the 2018 draft, both teams were essentially blank skates, build around your guy, and the Hawks surrounded theirs with fucking awesome players. And the Mavs...  I would love to have Clint Capela, John Collins, Gallo, Hunter, Huerter and Bogdan on my team, so I will adopt the Hawks for the rest of the playoffs"
"He isn't lying though, John Collins is huge, but I literally saw a guy about his size yesterday at Stonecrest Mall outside of Atlanta around his size light skinned with dreads. I see it all the time. May not have been 6 10 but he was bigger than me considerably and I'm 6 2. Atlanta is different. He isn't reaching with his comment."
[Joe Johnson ](https://youtu.be/LqEMxVuL9kk) understands John Collins
"Thinking on every single person in Atlanta I know (family, friends), I know not a single one of them would recognize John Collins. Hell... I think some people in this thread might be shocked to discover how many people in Atlanta wouldn't notice Trae Young. I know right? Atlanta is just really detached from its sports teams. Unless they're winning? But not really. In fact, not at all (see: Braves empty playoff seats, same with Hawks incl 60 win season). Falcons may have flicked the city's bean for a brief moment in time, but they dropped their pants and launched a radioactive deuce on their fanbase against the Pats, so that's that.   United is more a cultural phenomenon and is best discussed by anthropologists. Kinda kidding, but not really."
John Collins being 6‚Äô10 doesn‚Äôt mean people will know who he is. He‚Äôs not a celebrity. People probably assume he‚Äôs a college athlete when they see him at a gas station.
John Collins seems like a cool dude
"Yeah this is normal. I‚Äôm from New Zealand, where rugby is a *big fucking deal*. A genuine cultural force. A few years ago I went to a caf√© where my girlfriend was working, and the captain of the national team walked in with his wife and kids. Not just any rugby player on the local team, but a full-on legend and one of the two or three most prominent athletes in the country. Dude‚Äôs fucking huge too, not like he‚Äôs some regular looking guy. Between my girlfriend and the half dozen or so other staff working at the time, nobody had any idea who he was. A customer had to slip them a note basically saying ‚ÄúHey, the captain of the goddamn All Blacks is in your caf√© right now, keep that service top notch‚Äù before they realised.  It shouldn‚Äôt be at all surprising that there are people that don‚Äôt recognise John Collins, even if the Hawks were the biggest thing in Atlanta. I‚Äôd bet even big stars  in big basketball markets have a bunch of places they don‚Äôt get recognised too."
"&gt;one person who happens to live in or near Atlanta doesn‚Äôt recognize John Collins  Celtics fans: so Atlanta is full of fucking pieces of shit, huh?"
The timberwolves also really wanted John Collins. They really want to replace their pf.
Luka and porzingis is what people thought Trae and John Collins was
Bucks getting John Collins in foul trouble was crucial. I think he is the most ideal second option when Trae gets trapped in the pick and roll
"I love watching Tre. I love the passion, the attitude, the shimmies, the fuck you 3s. Not sure why he get so much hate but the guy makes the game fun to watch. Sure he baits a foul or two but if you can do it, might as well take advantage and force the NBA to change the rules. Also huge shoutout to John Collins. He‚Äôs played his bass off since the first minute of game 1.  Bucks in 6!"
All I‚Äôm saying is that getting to face a one man army and potentially a John Collins lead Hawks team in the semis and conference finals is extremely lucky. Unless you think John Collins is a superstar idk how you‚Äôd disagree with that
Tell me I‚Äôm wrong. Y‚Äôall beat a one man army and potentially a Hawks team lead by John Collins lmao. if you beat Phoenix tho I‚Äôll eat my words
Nate mcmillian need to post up john collins and play okongwu
Why the hell did John Collins only play 23 minutes and why was Huerter on the bench so long
John Collins is not a max player at all
This game is a perfect illustration of why Collins shouldn't get the max.  The hawks need another bucket getter when Trae is being stifled or playing badly.  John just isn't that guy.  He's reliant on other players too much and the hawks already have two guys that can do what John does outside of his three point shooting.
John Collins may have the best disappearing act out of anyone. One game you wanna give him the max and then next game he looks like a fringe starter
Give John Collins the max ü§ëü§ëü§ë
"Somebody better get John Collins away from ATL, because Trae and he are about to be fucking scary"
Hawks PA announcer sounds so deflated even when his own team scores. Announcing ‚ÄúJohn Collins‚Äù as if he plays for the Bucks. Game isn‚Äôt even over
John Collins and Clint capela don‚Äôt go inside? You don‚Äôt know basketball fr and saying that to others don‚Äôt change anything lmao virgin
Why does John Collins always look high as fuck?
Like John Collins. Oh wait he has been
Damn I forgot John Collins even existed lol
John Collins playing his ass off
John Collins could rail your muva and make her facebook feed famous
John Collins has a Voldemort nose
Why is John collins not in the game?!
"Also gotta look at what went wrong though. Was it really necessary to trade up there to take someone that honestly wasn't viewed as that much of a better prospect as 2 guys they could have taken at #15, and #20?. The move was questionable at the time too even without hindsight. And the team was weak at the 3/4, Anunoby and John Collins were lottery projected forwards that would have been the obvious concensus picks too."
Is it just me or does John Collins kind of look like Ryan Gosling?
"Honest question to my fellow Hawks fans  Why are so many of you in your feelings on Collins? Why is it that so many of you think hes a max player? Anytime I see someone mention him NOT being a max player they get downvoted.  So what the fuck is your deal with this topic? John Collins is 100%, objectively speaking, NOT a max basketball player."
John Collins WITH THE STIFF ARM
"Before these playoffs, the things I knew John Collins for the most were a PED suspension, and breaking a model plane in the 2019 dunk contest."
Fuckk man they don‚Äôt want me to hit my overs on John collins
"Spoon fed shots is a terrible argument. He sets good screens, has fantastic hands, and is a great finisher around the rim. Many of his baskets look easy because he makes then look easy, he has to catch in traffic, dodge a strip attempt and finish through contact. He's like a combo of John Collins and Capela I would absolutely love to have him on the Hawks."
"Could easily develop into a near Rudy Gobert level defender impact, while also having a nice hook shot and able to knock down mid range. Definitely worth a max not even close. Fact that he doesn't need the ball at all to impact the game makes him so much more valuable.   If John Collins is even close to deserving a max than Ayton not getting max would be disrespectful."
"Your players are either not very athletic, or are athletic and can't shoot FT. And then you have John Collins. Not sure what exactly he does."
John Collins is being sacrificed to a Greek god rn. Why Nate why
John Collins BBQ Chicken
"I think an underrated aspect of the hawks is how many solid ball handlers they have. Like trae, Gallo, kvon, John Collins, lou, and bodgan all make such smart decisions and have solid handles"
"John ""he ain't that strong"" Collins getting bodied by Giannis"
giannis making john collins look way less athletic is insane
Why John Collins got a Morty Smith haircut
John Collins looks like a lost little boy
John ‚ÄúKam Chancellor‚Äù Collins
"Yep and Trae Young and John Collins hate eachother too, remember?"
John Collins is hilarious to watch lol... Always starting and/or enjoying mischief
John Collins‚Äô impact this playoffs feels so much bigger than those 15/9 averages.
John Collins is such a good interview. Dude will be in media for sure after his career
who is the girl John collins is doing the interview with ?
Is John Collins cute or am I crazy
"so John collins used PEDs too, why isn't anyone talking about him"
Him and John Collins were sacrificial lambs to cover up the league wide usage. The league gotta look like they‚Äôre trying to stop it so someone gotta take a fall
It‚Äôs weirder that he was one of the so very few that got caught.  It would be naive to think nobody else other than him and John Collins use PEDs
"john collins: puts himself on his shirt, hypes himself up  ayton: booker on shirt, hypes up cp3."
Trading up for Zach Collins is what fucked them over when they could have stayed with #15 and #20 and taken both John Collins and OG Anunoby
"Trae 100% will get the max barring catastrophic injury.  John Collins *might* get a max contract. He spaces the floor well, plays good defense, pulls down boards, does his job well. That said, I don't know about much more upside to him and I can't say that I've watched enough Hawks games to make an appropriate statement on that."
Not a presser but John Collins had a great little interview with the TNT crew after their game 1 win against Milwaukee. Really down to earth guy
"**Current Players:**   Probably will have to max John Collins although 22-25m would definitely be ideal.  I‚Äôm open to a sign and trade with the right piece, but I think JC is just too important to the team culture and there‚Äôs not many better replacement pieces I see.  Get Trae set on his max.  Probably release Snell (unless he‚Äôll sign for cheap), Dunn, and Bruno.  Open to resigning Hill on the min if there‚Äôs space.  If Lou wants to run it another season, resign him on a 1-2 year contract. Otherwise (and maybe in addition) will need a secondary guy, probably a veteran, to run the backup unit offense.  Hope Reddish, Hunter, Bogi and the whole rest of the team can get healthy in the off-season and keep developing.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pickups:**  The only guy I really see necessary is someone to run the backup unit, and probably can't be too expensive, some targets I see, Derozan, Lowry, Oladipo, D rose,And give Nate the official coaching job"
No he got caught doing it. It‚Äôs kind of an open secret that steroids and hormone treatment have been a part of the sport for a long time  Edit: [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/11/5/20949723/nba-ped-suspensions-deandre-ayton-wilson-chandler-john-collins-steroids-banned-substances)
Shit if 20/10 gets you the max Hawks gonna have to give both Trae young and John Collins the max.
"Hell, look at John Collins more recently. Easily getting max this offseason after turning down 90 million"
Hawks Realistic offseason  * Sign and trade John Collins for pretty much anything * Extend Trae if he doesn't want to wait to make an all-NBA team and get the rookie supermax * Draft Tre Mann as a backup point guard * Hold out hope for the 2022 FA class and that Hunter and Okongwu can develop into top 40 players
Meh John Collins turned down 90/4 but he‚Äôll prob get more
"He will get a max based on forecasting his potential growth, but he hasn't performed at max player level yet. Everybody gets a max these days. John Collins will probably get maxed this offseason."
"Idk if anybody had mentioned it yet, but John Collins was also suspended for using PEDs"
Same about to happen with John Collins
"lmao the hawks are in an even easier conference and they have a supporting cast of John collins, Gallo, Bogdan, Capela and huerter who are much more reliable scorers than the rest of the warriors and the warriors would've been the 7 seed in the east"
Between him and [John Collins‚Äô shirt](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/21/john-collins-wears-shirt-of-him-dunking-on-joel-embiid-to-press-conference/amp/) the league is going in the right direction fashion wise
I see people ragging on the analysis but how are you supposed to say anything of substance when you get like 30 seconds each to speak? TNT gives Shaq and Kenny twice that much time just to quibble over whether John Collins set a screen or not.
John Collins? Jae Crowder? Marcus Morris.
"First video, John Collins is down low, should have been at the 3 pt line, bad alignment.  Second video, that's not contested.  third - should do the pick and roll with Capela, not JC and JC should have picked and popped.  Again bad alignment from JC.  4th, JC shouldn't be in the corner like that unless Trae penetrates.  Yes Trae makes a mistake, he should have gone in for a layup and then passed it to JC.  Otherwise, even if he passes to Collins, Giannis would have recovered.  5th - Trae young missed Huerter, wide open.  &amp;#x200B;  Trae makes some mistakes but its JC who's screwing up most of them.  Having him AND Capela under the basket screws up the alignment.  Either take Capela out or JC needs to stay at the 3pt line."
Not just Ayton. Jerami Grant and John Collins are both significantly better than Love
John Collins was good before Trae got drafted though...

"Except Bogi is playing? Don‚Äôt matter if he‚Äôs playing through injury, he is still playing. Can‚Äôt say Hawks are playing without their 3rd best player when they literally are. Also, what about John Collins and Clint Capela?"
John Collins and Bogi are playing tho
With John Collins in the playoffs still you taking him over Zion? Taking Cam Reddish over Anthony Edwards?
He could match up pretty good with John Collins
No disrespect but I‚Äôve been enjoying watching freak athlete John Collins meet freak athlete giannis antetokounmpo
Gotta love John Collins saying ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt score on me‚Äù over and over like a dumbass after he had to foul Giannis to prevent from getting scored on while Giannis had 15 points at the time
Lol John Collins is a center getting bodied by a pg. Hit the gym
John Collins with GOAT tier banter with Huerter... dude is hilarious
"Aaaaand I‚Äôm a John Collins fan now, that shit was hilarious lmao"
"Thank you Pritchard for taking TJ Leaf over John Collins, who was projected to go higher even then"
Wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if John Collins‚Äô first name was Fort?
"""*Smells like Red Velvet in here. Real velvety...*"" - John Collins"
John Collins seems like a good teammate
It‚Äôs funny seeing Trae and John Collins smiling and doing showboaty shit. Those dudes are just having fun lol
Giannis fouled John Collins on the putback
John Collins gonna get paid
John Collins can fuck my girl  There I said it
John Collins goes to show that boxing out is a lost art.
"John Collins is listed at 6'9""?!! He looks shorter than that. More like 6'6"""
"Hey, call me crazy, but we could use a homeless man's John Collins."
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"Fun Fact, Trae and John Collins have never won an NBA playoff game 2.  Another Fun Fact that makes this irrelevant is that they've never lost an NBA playoff series."
"plus we really gonna act like the kings are some paragon of player development? lmfao. how many promising lottery picks has that team touched only to completely waste them? john collins is starting and killing it in the eastern conference finals, meanwhile a player with a similar archetype who was considerably more hyped as a prospect coming into the NBA is toiling away in the league dumpster cuz theyve never been able to get their heads outta their asses.  monte mcnair is slowly turning that franchise around, but you cant put a forest fire out in a day. sac needs bagley gone just as much as bag needs a new city, but i have no doubt that if any other team had drafted bagley that he'd be looking a lot better than he currently is"
Oh just Reggie stating the obvious after Trae's off the backboard oop to John Collins.
to be fair john collins still doesnt get the ball enough and is probably only happy cuz yall are winning!
John Collins has no post game.... like genuinely fumbles the ball all the time and gets bodied out. He has a decent midrange and throws up the hook shot of the catch but he is not a post guy at all.
"When you‚Äôre 23 your ceiling is pretty much the sky.  Any of luka, tatum, Mitchell, trae, Zion, dbook, ja, brown, Collins and others have all time great potential.  Even some of the younger guys like lamelo, wiseman, antman have it too.   If you told me that 10 years from now, brown would be a 6-7 Kobe and he would be alternating titles with a John Collins (aka athletic Barkley) led atlanta squad while trae and tatum cap out as borderline Top 10 guys I‚Äôd buy it."
"On the contrary, I would never say that sir. John Collins is my best freind."
"I‚Äôm going crazy, I‚Äôve seen some version of John Collins ain‚Äôt shit for years it‚Äôs so weird"
Exactly. How does John Collins look or play like a high end role player at all? I swear these dudes don‚Äôt actually watch the hawks play and just say shit
"Guys like John Collins makes the playoffs so fun to watch. That man flew infor the lob, I had to replay that clip so many times, it looked like he flew over the other team."
"I fuck with reddish cuz of college but john collins is a dawg right now and u pay ur dawgs right now, u dont save that for a future maybe dawg"
Reddish just bodied his 2 appearances in the Conference finals while John Collins is regular as hell but is going to demand a max deal.  You honestly cant do that mathematics?
"I don't know, but I'd take John Collins if that's the case"
"Can John ""the Baptist"" Collins come too?"
"They should go full-on youth movement.  Start by dealing Derozan for one of Simmons, Myles Turner, John Collins or Markannen.   They pray for a shot at Chet Holgren, Emoni Bates or Victor Wembanyama."
Doesn‚Äôt even have to be about lebron lol - Woj‚Äôll tweet something about John Collins contract maneuvering or something and the top reply will be some rando saying ‚Äúlefraud could never‚Äù
"Idk if it's actually possible, but a Sign-and-Trade between him and John Collins was something I'd seen some people mention.(Derozan signing with the Spurs to facilitate it.)"
Reminded me of that possession where the Sixers gave up two(?) offensive rebounds resulting in a John Collins three from the corner.
Hawks are going to regress based on contacts and likely losing John Collins.
At least Ayton is clutch.  And I'd rather pay Mikal than John Collins
Those are John Collins numbers lol
Imagine John Collins on the Lakers sheeshhhhh. I hear the Hawks like energy guys off the bench
"Coaches a decade ago, 2010/11 season...   **Former NBA Players**   Larry Drew   Doc Rivers   Larry Brown   Paul Silas   Byron Scott   Rick Carlisle   George Karl   John Kuester   Keith Smart   Rick Adelman   Vinny Del Negro   Phil Jackson   Lionel Hollins   Scott Skiles   Kurt Rambis   Avery Johnson   Monty Williams   Scott Brooks   Doug Collins   Alvin Gentry   Nate McMillan   Paul Westphal   Jerry Sloan   Ty Corbin   Jay Triano   **Non NBA Players**   Thibs   Frank Vogel   Jim Obrien   Erik Spoelstra   SVG   Greg Popovich"
"If you doubt what Kuzma is saying I think there‚Äôs something people need to remember:   #Kuzma is 6‚Äô10   It‚Äôs a small thing but a lot of people think of him as the 6‚Äô8 wing he came into that league as. Man he‚Äôs 6‚Äô10. Anywhere else, he‚Äôs exclusively a 4. But in LA they ask him to play the wing a lot. Imagine John Collins at the 3 he‚Äôd look a shell of himself.   Kuzma at the 4 getting easy looks from a PG ‚Äî-like lobs, not just 3s‚Äî-would be at least a 17/18 point scorer"
"He's definitely not referring to John Collins. The Hawks only have 5 free agents; 10 players on their roster are already under contract next season:  Bogdonavic, Capela, Hunter, Young, Okongwu, Huerter, Fernando, Gallinari, Dunn, Reddish.   They spent about 115m in 2020-2021, and are spending 95m on the roster so far next year. Collins should get signed for a bit over 20m. It's a no-brainer and I'd guess he wants to stay.  &amp;#x200B;  What they're actually referring to is probably more cultural. They probably really like some of the role players they're going to have to let walk:  Tony Snell, Solomon Hill, Brandon Goodwin, but the person they're really talking about:   Lou Will. Playoffs were good for him but a really terrible regular season. This is what he's talking about. No one in that locker room wants to see him go. Get that man an assistant job"
"&gt;[‚ÄùWe‚Äôll certainly make him an offer in free agency as well, and he‚Äôll have the ability to see if he can get an offer from another team. But at the end of the day, we view him as part of our team, and I don‚Äôt see a restricted free agency situation where we would just let him walk for nothing.‚Äù](https://www.sportstalkatl.com/hawks-travis-schlenk-discusses-john-collins-trade-value/)  This is about as close as a GM can possibly get to saying he‚Äôll match any offer without explicitly saying it. According to Schlenk, the only way we‚Äôre moving on from JC is via a sign and trade. He‚Äôs going to match any offer, and if the price is too steep for him, then he‚Äôs going to try to trade him, but he‚Äôd rather have JC on the max than lose him for nothing."
"Giannis is in his 8th season. It‚Äôs not very common that players improve much more going into their 9th season. For instance, Capela just turned 27, but I don‚Äôt think anyone expects him to be getting any better.   On the other hand, the oldest of our 6 man young core is John Collins, and he‚Äôs only 23. Our core of players have significantly higher growth potential. I don‚Äôt see much in the way of the Bucks, Sixers, or Nets."
John Collins is a 6 9 dude shooting 40% from three on reasonable volume two straight seasons with TS around 65%.  Definitely not ordinary.
"As long as John Collins doesn‚Äôt choke Embiid out while dunking on him, Embiid should have many more good years. Kawhi could retire tomorrow and it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me"
John Collins/Frank Kaminsky LMAO
"Hey, Frank Kaminsky is on there with John Collins."
"John Collins and Frank Kaminsky, seriously? lol"
John Collins/ Frank Kamisky?
"I would argue that giannis is quite skilled for his position at least.  he's obviously a subpar shooter, but he is good at dribbling and playmaking  to the point where he can be a major ball handler.  There are loads of athletic wings and big men that do not have as much skill as Giannis and therefore are worse (Javale Mcgee, John Collins, Bam,Deandre Ayton*,Gobert etc.)  I guess you could say compared to his superstar peers, he is unskilled, but in general he's pretty skilled.  *I know Ayton is on a run right now, but Giannis uses his dribbling (skills) to self create scoring, while Ayton needs a playmaker to help create his,because he is not skilled at dribbling."
"[Actually, he is.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/atlanta-hawks/john-collins-23614/)"
John collins is great at D
Ben Simmons averaged 9.9 ppg against a bottom half defense in the league where even that point total is inflated due to hack a Ben.   His primary defenders were John Collins and Danillo Gallinari. He didnt have to worry about rim protection in the paint either as Capela was glued to Embiid.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. If they throw the max at John Collins they could compete next year   Fox/Halliburton/Barnes/KP/Collins can win against anyone
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
TL;DR   1. Reggie Jackson  2. John Collins   3. Blake Griffin  4. Cameron Payne  5. Austin Rivers
"Beal, kat and if kawhi leaves george but if none of them available they should go for maybe a sign and trade for john collins or maybe try getting conley maybe norm powell and covington/nurk if blazers rebuild maybe trade for warren/brogdon/turner maybe grant for wiseman and wiggins maybe pascal or simmons/tobi or trade wiseman sign and trade oubre for hayward and if magic don't want him issac"
"I'd see about giving Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, John Collins, or Christian Wood a run"
"I think you guys have a real path forward if you trade them (plus maybe another 1st) for a wing and then throw a fat contract at John Collins  Maybe trade Bagley, Hield, 9 for KP?  Something like Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/KP/Collins is a solid ass lineup"
I don't think kawhi is going anywhere. Pat Bev also likely to stay with the clippers. John Collins will be intresting.
anyone else think Kaminsky and John Collins look like cousins?
"I always thought Joe was overrated. In my opinion, he basically fits the template of the most common guys to get overrated: guys who score a lot, but at moderate/slightly below average efficiency, and don't do enough else to help you win. (The opposite of Al Horford, really, who I was always a big fan of). I mean, I think there's a reason those teams typically petered out in the high 40s wins and the player who missed the season after he left Phoenix was Amare, who was injured most of the year.   I was never huge Josh Smith fan.   Korver didn't get to Atl until 2013.  Now that Trae seems to have made a slight but crucial shift in his approach to leading the team, and Collins doesn't sulk when he's not scoring, I love the way all this team's parts fit together. They've got a lot of guys (Bogie, Gallo, the second-half-of-the-season John Collins) who help you win more than their box score stats say. Capela is basically the perfect center to pair with Trae. If Hunter can nudge his three-point shooting up a tad he's a great fit with the rest of the team.   The great forgotten Hawks team, IMHO, is 2015. I think they could have put a scare into the Cavs in the east if not for the NYPD. (Everybody forgets that team, but Thabo was the guy whose job was to make LeBron work for it. It doesn't feel like an injury to a role guy should turn a series so dramatically, but that team was like a Swiss watch - everybody excelled in their role because they understood what it was and they weren't being asked to do anything outside of their strengths - but remove one cog and the whole thing falls apart) In hindsight, I suspect David Blatt would have outcoached Bud in a close series, if LeBron let him - but that's not a given."
"Jerami Grant was not shooting the way he is now and is probably going to look for more money, Bobby Portis is playing on a championship team and could easily get paid more, but some players thrive off of bench roles and taking the back seat so idk but Myles Turner is definitely the best non-rookie contract in the NBA. But again, John Collins is 23 and you pay for potential as well when dealing with a player like that. He can very possibly get better at a lot of things considering his age and the current coaching staff"
"Okay so they now have defensive coaching, as I assumed against from the out of context stats. I thought Nate was the coach for the entire year, so my bad. Back to my original point. John Collins is a part of this defensive improvement right? Or is he slowing it down? Does he not have the potential to be a better perimeter defender with the better coaching staff over time? Or is that all just a highlight reel thing im doing and watching him block a shot or two with no real basis for that assumption?  I assume you‚Äôve hooped too so you know that getting blown by sometimes isn‚Äôt bad defense? And all the other little nuances of good defensive games? Again, all under the impression you know better than I do, and i‚Äôll go about this discussion with that assumption. How is my original statement not valid of him being a big that ‚Äî CAN POSSIBLY defend the perimeter (better than most other big men) with EVEN LESS, BUT POSSIBLY MORE (again, he is not great at this, but has better potential and has shown more flashes of) playmaking ability with an EASILY IMPROVABLE (meaning something that is not perfect, but a part of his game enough that it is a threat) jumper that can tie into all this improvement within the next year. I got some stats wrong, but he is in fact improved as a defender over time has he not? And can he not further improve given his athletic ability and the fact he is only in his 3rd year?  Im a laker fan that lives in phoenix and spend a majority of my time watching those teams. His defense, like Kuzma‚Äôs, has improved over a few years. I watched this seasons hawks games after some of the injuries died down and saw a lot of young-player flashes of potential from Collins, and when i say that i mean all he lacks is consistency pure isolation d. And he fouled a lil bit too much here and there before but this season seems to be better. Pure athleticism is my argument for him being able to guard out and help defense, not one on one staying in front of the ball on an iso. There are HARDLY any great iso defenders with the likes of Kawhi, Mikal Bridges, Avery Bradley, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy and others like them. Those defenders are rare, and often are the best players in the league. I think my comment got mistaken given the definitive relativity of ‚Äúaverage‚Äù in my own head.   I was wrong about the stats, but im basing a lot of what I said on the ABILITY he has rather than the CONSISTENCY he has done it with. And hes done some of these things more than once so its not crazy to think he‚Äôll be a better defender and better shooter as time goes on. I think Nate can give him the ball and let him work more once next season rolls around and create deliberate passing actions off of that ability. Like i said, it doesn‚Äôt take much with a player of his standard to make good passes as defenses will have to collapse on him and trae, and especially with having trae, bogdan, hunter, and huerter on offense he‚Äôll have a much easier time doing those things and it is worth keeping him for those reasons. He has a reasonable ceiling."
"Also, is the Dort, SGA, John Collins big three maybe elite? Would be interesting to see"
They should be able to keep this core for another year at least. John Collins is a RFA so if we don't come to an agreement to a contract here and he finds a contract elsewhere we'll have to match it.   After Trae gets his Max tho then it'll get interesting.   Kevin Heurter will get between $15-20 mil a year. While he has been great in the playoffs his regular season numbers are okay not all star-esque so I think we can sign him to a Bogi style deal.   Cam reddish and DeAndre Hunter are in the same boat as well. They haven't had a crazy season to warrant a max.   Only guy who warrants a max is Trae......maybe John Collins.   The evolution of Onyeka Okungwu will determine what happens to JC or Clint.   Tbh we need bulkier PF/C so I hope Onyeka Okungwu grows and bulks up.
"&gt;So because I expressed my opinion that paying John Collins would be a massive overpay and I‚Äôm a Lakers fan I‚Äôm ‚Äúthrowing stones?‚Äù  Yes.  &gt;I‚Äôm sorry me not agreeing with the reported contract he‚Äôs asking for and whilst also cheering for another team to you means I‚Äôm talking shit. You do realize I‚Äôm not the only person who feels this way and not everybody who does is a Lakers fan correct?  Idk its just weird counting a player's cash like that. Just my take.  &gt;If what you‚Äôre saying is true then everything you say about a franchise not being historically competent would be you just talking shit, because you‚Äôre a fan of the clippers, correct?   I mean by definition of rings culture then yeah I would be throwing stones. But we've been competitive over the last 12 years and have been by all measure a different franchise since we drafted Blake Griffin back in '09. Still a valid observation.  &gt;I don‚Äôt need you to recap the situation like I‚Äôm some idiot that doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. I expressed my OPINION and that‚Äôs just what it is.  One of us is mad here. And it's not me lol."
"So because I expressed my opinion that paying John Collins would be a massive overpay and I‚Äôm a Lakers fan I‚Äôm ‚Äúthrowing stones?‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry me not agreeing with the reported contract he‚Äôs asking for and whilst also cheering for another team to you means I‚Äôm talking shit. You do realize I‚Äôm not the only person who feels this way and not everybody who does is a Lakers fan correct? If what you‚Äôre saying is true then everything you say about a franchise not being historically competent would be you just talking shit, because you‚Äôre a fan of the clippers, correct?   I don‚Äôt need you to recap the situation like I‚Äôm some idiot that doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. I expressed my OPINION and that‚Äôs just what it is."
"Again, what is the point of mentioning Deng being overpaid by the Lakers and nothing else have to do with my prediction that paying John Collins the max will be a massive overpay?"
"I‚Äôm really hoping that San Antonio can pull off some big signing this summer. John Collins would be a dream, but I‚Äôll take Oladipo even. We just need another good piece."
"John Collins, eventually.   Don‚Äôt know about X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs but I found him to be really vibrant and entertaining in his interviews during this playoff run after knowing nothing mostly about his personality. He‚Äôs also extremely telegenic."
"One or two good passes a game is more than a lot of bigs, and that means in the right system he could probably do more. Nate McMillan coached one of the better passers a year before so I could definitely see John Collins slightly improving to add an assist per game which could be significant. I just don‚Äôt think this is his ceiling."
"You're 100% not describing John Collins lol. A hyper athletic wing that has a steaky jumper, but is great at finishing inside and off lobs who is poor defensively and can't create for others or his own shot is a more apt description. This isn't me hating on Collins, what he does well he does really well but he isn't worth a max contract."
"You're right, it was great game. 23-15. His best game of the playoffs.   I recall Brook Lopez going off for one great game so I looked at his playoff numbers and was surprised how similar they were to John Collins.   Brook Lopez 13/6/1.8b on 57% shooting  John Collins 14/9/.6b on 55%  ."
"really just said let john collins walk so gallo can play start 4 and you can sign cam payne? lmao cmon man, you're way over thinking this  the goal is to win basketball games, not whatever money saving tactics you have in mind"
"people are so focused on value and numbers and stats but at the end of the day, its either keep john collins, or lose him for nothing/a downgrade. they just hit the ecf and beat the sixers. why would you want to not continue building on that. so i agree hard with you"
"&gt;D'Lo was an eastern conference all-star one time as a good stats bad team guy, he's never healthy (he's only played the full season twice in 6 years and the first time was his rookie year), he has little in his offensive arsenal aside from spread pick and roll, he's a terrible max   He's a great off the dribble shooter and shooter in general also whatever the limitations there are with D'lo they aren't related to John Collins."
Yeah except that guy was an all star and was #1 option on a playoff team. I've watched John Collins float around on the court the entire playoffs because he can't create for himself and can't dribble to save his life.
John Collins becomes significantly less good when you have to pay him 25-30m a year. It hampers roster construction by a lot when you have a player who isn't worth a max taking that slot (trust me I know this feeling...)
unlikely to yield something as good as john collins
he kinda made Trae look like John Collins
"I don‚Äôt think guard defense is unimportant. I think it‚Äôs extremely important and we see that come real basketball time in the playoffs. The amazing defenses in regular season are all anchored by bigs w teams that run a drop defense scheme and funnel to midrange and floaters.  Playoffs comes, better teams can small ball it up and all these ‚Äúgreat‚Äù defenders at the rim are on islands and it‚Äôs literally all man on man defense with no camping in paint because the players are too good to drop on.  It‚Äôs never ever made sense to me that people will say Gobert is the best defender in the NBA when he doesn‚Äôt ever cover any of the best offensive players in the NBA. The best defenders in the NBA are whoever you want guarding Durant and Bron and Kawhi and Luka. I don‚Äôt care how good the Jazz regular season defense is, because in winning time no one plays like they do in regular season.  So yeah I think perimeter defense is of paramount importance, because in the playoffs without perimeter defense you‚Äôre fucked.   But I do agree if the player doesn‚Äôt bring a positive on the offensive end it‚Äôs not worthwhile.  Our poor overall team defense came from a few things, but mainly DeRozan isn‚Äôt good at defense even when he‚Äôs fully engaged and he‚Äôs not fully engaged nearly enough. But the other reason is‚Ä¶if you can‚Äôt score you‚Äôre constantly in transition defense off of misses and it‚Äôs a lot harder to defend off live balls than it is made baskets/dead balls.  Poeltl, Dejounte, DWhite, Vassell, Keldon all have elite defensive traits - but we need more scoring and facilitation. Hopefully DWhite is healthy, Dejounte has improved a little every yr, Keldon made a big leap from yr 1 to yr2. Which is why I‚Äôm A-Ok w bringing DeRozan back and using the other 20m+ to try and get a decent restricted FA (Lauri or Duncan Robinson, John Collins played his way out of being available).  Go into next year with: DeRozan, Dejounte, DWhite, Keldon, Vassell, Poeltl, Lonnie, pick 12, someone like Lauri or Duncan Robinson level.  That‚Äôs 8-9 deep of dudes that I‚Äôll fight with. Give it a yr, if they aren‚Äôt a 45+ win team, then you can easily dismantle it and piece out the players for 4-5 future firsts.  That‚Äôs the power of having no bad contracts and everyone on the roster getting better and being one of the youngest rosters in the league."
This is such facts. I‚Äôd be willing to put money on John Collins underperforming a max contract.
We were hoping for that out of Dennis Schroder but he went completely opposite of John Collins.
"The salary cap works in a way that allows you to go over the salary cap to sign players with ""bird rights"". You have a player's bird rights when a player is on a contract for more than 3 years essentially, there are other exceptions to this but for the sake of simplicity this is generally the case.  So in the Hawks situation, what they want to do is sign John Collins to a contract this off season, and then go over the cap to sign Trae Young next year using his bird rights. However, if they dont sign Collins this off season, they'd be using their salary cap to sign Trae Young but they CANT go over their remaining cap space to sign other free agents.  For example, assuming the salary cap is 100M and the Hawks have 60M occupied. They can sign Collins to a 30M max contract, and then go over the cap to sign Trae to another 30M contract ending up with 120M in salary.  If they dont sign Collins, they'll have to use their own cap space to sign Trae which would bring them to 90M salary, meaning they now only have 10M to to work with in Free Agency who most likely won't be as good as Collins.   Now technically the Hawks can use their cap space to sign FAs first BEFORE they go over the cap to extend Trae Young next off season, but a player of Trae's caliber usually command a very early extension (this off season Free Agency) which takes that cap space away.   So in this case, the Hawks are actually better off slightly overpaying Collins in order to remain a better team, and Collins' and his agent will use that to leverage his contract."
"A team with John Collins, even with handles, as a 1st option would not make the playoffs. Trust me."
So did John Collins lol these young guys probably don‚Äôt know how to hide it like vets do
"I think what hurts the Mavs is that you traded assets to get KP, while the Hawks just have to match an offer.  Look at the Warriors with Wiggins.... he's not on a good contract by any means but they're in all the trade talks simply because they have other assets to attach to Wiggins' salary to make trades enticing for other teams. That's exactly what the Hawks want to do with Collins - have him there as a salary filler while being able to attach other things such as picks/young players for trades.  John Collins isn't undersized though, he's 6'9 is basically the size you want from your PF."
John Collins and Trae Young give me Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire vibes.
John ‚ÄúMaxed Out‚Äù Collins
Rightly deserved it. His time at the Pacers proved that he did not receive ample support and pieces from the former GM.   Only thing left for the hawks is to resign John Collins and Lou Williams in this upcoming free agency.
Wait John Collins isnt core? Capela isn‚Äôt core???
"to be fair to the ringer, i definitely remember reading articles about rifts among the players and between john collins/trae specifically. it's not like doubting them was unreasonable, they were like 10 games under .500 at one point. but i guess it was lloyd pierce all along? hah"
"That is the exact type of comment that is so annoying to read and why Bill and Russillo deserve some criticism. He averaged about 30/4/9 in his second season on 59.5% TS.   Maybe some players (cough John Collins who wants a max contract cough) want the ball more and are frustrated Trae always has the ball to start possessions, but he has been putting up great stats with good efficiency for a while now."
"The issue comes when you have to start paying them all.  Right now they were on rookie contracts so you could get Galo, Bogi and other solid rotation pieces. Once Trae is on a max and the other guys are making more than rookie contracts, they'll have a hard time keeping everyone and adding depth.  Just look at John Collins - I don't think he's worth the max but if Hawks don't give near it, some team will probably overpay him."
"Nah but they were right at that time. We can't ignore all the shit that happened at the beginning of THIS season where John Collins and a bunch of Hawks players were literally quoted as saying they were annoyed with the way Trae played. Sure a lot of it was probably Lloyd's fault, but saying it's a huge L is pretty disingenuous as that was literally the truth at that point."
"It was legit wild. You guys went from a bottom tier team to the ECF in ridiculous time. Trae, John Collins, Capela, and Huerter really stepped up and that was cool to see. Hope you guys keep that momentum going and become a consistent top team. Trae is killer and I love how much he embraces people shit talking him. It‚Äôs fun as hell honestly"
"Trae Young (22), Kevin Huerter (22), Cam Reddish (21), DeAndre Hunter (23),   John Collins (23), Onyeka Okongwu (20).  Got to be up there for best young cores in the league, especially with how they've almost all proven themselves in these playoffs."
"They've got a decent young core that they can lock up to decent non-max contracts  Dejounte and White are locked into 17 million per year until 2024 and 2025.   Lonnie and Vassell are on their rookie contracts until 2022 and 2024.  Keldon, Samanic, Eubanks and Poetl are alsonon their rookie contracts until 2023 as well.   Worst part is being in mediocre purgatory, not competing for championships but also not abysmal enough for a Top 5 chance.   If I was Buford and Pop, I'd trade away Derozan for a young and budding star. Ben Simmons, Wiggins, John Collins, Lauri Markannen, Myles Turner.  Then tank for a shot at Chet Holmgren or Emoni Bates."
On the flip side you could end up paying John Collins the maximum contract
"I think most analysts shared that sentiment, but Bill and Russillo definitely took it too far. There were reports coming out that players (I think John Collins at least) were frustrated playing with Trae and how he runs the offense. I think Nate McMillan needs a lot of credit here, because they started winning and all of the drama disappeared."
"Congratulations, they managed to win 2 games against a battered Hawks team who's best player outside of Trae Young is John Collins. Doesn't change the fact that they have benefited tremendously from other team's having their star players injured."
Mavs fans were ready to max John Collins a month ago i guarantee you none of them would now
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
"&gt; John Collins suspended for 25 games   &gt; Cam Reddish, one of the worst players in the league last season, averaged 27 MPG    &gt; Team improves immensely when Young plays and actually had a respectable offence   ""Trae Young is an empty stats player!!!""  I can't believe some people were stupid enough to watch him put up 30 PPG/9 APG on 60% TS and claim he wasn't good lmao."
"Reggie Jackson, Cam Reddish, and John Collins are the only ones who ""raised their stock""  The rest of those guys were gonna end up getting max contracts anyway if they want"
"I mean, you're betting on him taking a Jaylen-like leap, but not every 23-year-old does.  Either way, I'm convinced Ainge saw him before the season started and knew he looked like a completely different player.  That contract was signed pretty late before the season started, and the minute he stepped on the court that year it was obvious how much he had improved. I have no opinion on whether Collins should get maxed, but saying, ""Well, JB improved, so John Collins will"" isn't the best argument."
"None of Capela, Bogdan, Gallo, or Lou are getting significantly better  People don't want to hear it, but Trae will most likely only make small gains from here on out. He's not gonna suddenly average 35/13 or something. I think John Collins is closer to his ceiling than people want to admit either. Growth is *not* linear at all, and by 23 guys are a lot closer to their peaks than I think people imagine.   It's why all these young and scary teams tend to disappoint after an initial surprising season- people expect unrealistic improvement.   Cam, Hunter, and Huerter are the ones I see getting better by a solid margin. But will that be enough to make up for vets getting worse? Can it make up for the very large margin between the Hawks and the contenders?   Probably not."
"It's still really damn similar man  Growth is not nearly as linear as people like to imagine. John Collins and Trae likely won't be vastly better players than they are now. Gallo, capela and Bogdon are who they are    Cam and Hunter can improve, but I don't think there's nearly as much room as people are saying"
"Hawks fans have been hoping all year to get John on a Jaylen Brown type contract.  Probably won‚Äôt happen now, but our GM is saying that no matter what, John Collins isn‚Äôt walking for free. He will be matched, or signed and traded"
"I loved seeing John Collins say to the bucks players ""go win it"" right after the game ended. Excited to see Giannis in a finals finally!"
I will pay Jaylen's uber to the airport if the Hawks offer John Collins.
"Jaylen Brown is what every team is desperately looking for in today‚Äôs game. Celtics bet on him making a leap and he did.   John Collins is a very good player who isn‚Äôt quite the perfect skill set for the modern game. Even if he continues to improve he‚Äôs not suddenly going to have handles and perimeter athleticism.   The other issue is the Hawks can‚Äôt sign everybody. Trae is a max. Hunter is basically a max (just like Jaylen, Hunter is what every team desperately wants). Is Collins really the best 3rd guy to complement those two?  And what about the other players on the team?  Reddish, Huerter, Okongwu. These guys will all need to get paid to varying degrees.   I think they absolutely sign Collins to a reasonable deal but they really can‚Äôt go max on him.   It‚Äôs the proverbial good problem to have - too much young talent to keep everyone. I just think Collins is the odd man out."
"Jaylen learned to dribble, make his own shot, a better 3 pointer and is coming off the bench. Everybody knew that he is better than advertise. While John Collin can only dunk so good, tunnel vision, only catch and shoot 3. I can continue but Collins isnt on the same tier as Jaylen."
John Collins maybe?
"Hawks would definitely match any offer on collins. Even if they renounce all their bird rights, the maximum amount of cap space they can create is about $19 million and no one in the free agency market going for that price is better than John collins  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/atlanta-hawks/cap/2021/"

Paying John Collins the max might be as bad as paying Otto Porter the max. All it takes is one dumb team to screw Atlanta over.   Collins is a 20-24 mil per year player. Not a max player.
"It doesn't matter, he has the team by the balls. A young emerging playoff team's main goal during the offseason is to get better at all costs and at worse, run it back and not regress. That makes the Hawks the easiest mark for a poison pill contract with one of their key contributors because they don't have many options, especially with Trae, Huerter, Hunter, Cam and Capela all looking to get paid in the next two years.   John has a tiny cap hold from being a mid-late first rookie contract, so there's not even the excuse of allocating the remaining cap to other free agents because you can still sign them and keep Collins with his bird rights. At this point, the only reason why JC doesn't get re-signed is because ownership doesn't want to foot the bill for the luxury tax, which would be a very, very bad sign for our chances to contend going forward."
"John Collins isn‚Äôt worth the max, I‚Äôd love to have him back on the hawks but not for the max. He‚Äôs completely reliant on Trae, he has no off the dribble game, and has way too many games where you don‚Äôt even notice he‚Äôs playing. Plus with onyeka playing well and hopefully developing an outside shot he might replace him, or even hunter at the 4. This is all my opinion but I don‚Äôt see his as a max player"
"Diuretic , along with John Collins"
John collins
Now they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs John Collins.
What's your take on John Collins signing?
"That is true, my fault, I was wrong.  I know it may come off as Trae hate mentioning this, it really is not my goal, the dude is great and still only 22, but the stats for those two games is 9/40 with 11 turnovers. It‚Äôs not good. But again, he is 22 and has plenty of time to fix his issues. As long as the Hawks can keep it their core together, especially Capela and Onyeka, him being a defensive liability won‚Äôt show as much, especially especially if John Collins continues to improve on that end. That will allow him to focus more on taking better care of the ball, because while averaging like 9 assist is great, it isn‚Äôt as good when you average nearly or more then 5 turnovers. He can also work on knowing when he is off and allowing his teammates to flourish in times when he is unable too, he definitely has to work on trusting them more (which he did a lot for most of these playoffs but just struggled with for important games.)  Anyways, OP didn‚Äôt link a source so it‚Äôs irrelevant haha"
John Collins wants 27mil to give up offensive rebounds
John Collins over Randle? You wasted time writing everything after that lmaoooooo
Switch Lonzo with John Collins and that 17 team looks pretty nice. Still not as good as 12 or 18 tho
"The gallinari contact doesn‚Äôt actually matter that much, the hawks won‚Äôt hit luxury tax until next year, assuming John Collins gets the max, trae gets maxed, and Huerter gets an extension. And the luxury tax can be pretty easily avoided by just trading Gallo or capela next year, or not picking up the last year of Gallos contact which only has 5 million guaranteed."
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
"And Sixers defense was enough to limit Giannis. Certainly more than John Collins and Capella. Bucks weren't the Nets, they were very beatable by a team that had the size to deal with them. That series would be even, especially if in this scenario Giannis still misses two games. Sixers fans just backtracking after saying all year they were going to win the chip just do they don't have to admit that not trading for Lowry was a mistake"
John Collins literally tried to do that a couple years ago  https://twitter.com/shaqtin/status/1096989512239140865?s=21

"That applies when you're maxing a guy like John Collins or Lonzo Ball. This would be like the Grizzlies trading away Morant to not pay him just so they can get some high picks and draft someone like, well, Morant."
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
Wake Forest. Chris Paul lost unfortunately but Jeff Teague got that ring! And John Collins was in the ECF
He was the hawks best playmaker John Collins rookie year haha :(
"That's what's funny about DeMar fans to me. They'll insist over and over that he's this awesome player that can fit in a contender and get annoyed when you say he's not top 40. But when it comes time to pay him like you would a player that good, nobody wants to do it.  The truth is DeMar is probably valued around as much or slightly less than John Collins. Who will never be able to consistently create shots on his own very well, will probably never be an all star, and fans of his own team say he's not worth a max."
they could also throw a max at John Collins IMO. Atlanta probably matches but he does fit SA's players.
"a much better player to replace Dwight Powell's role as Luka's roller to the paint - at the super top end it's Giannis Antetokounmpo or Anthony Davis, then maybe John Collins or Chris Boucher as more realistic options?"
"Idk but Kevin Huerter or John Collins aren't certified superstars or foundational pieces. They're very good young role players that may be more than that but probably not. All I know is they shouldn't be kept ""at all cost."""
"Kevin Huerter, Trae, John Collins and De'Andre Hunter are the players they need to keep at all costs. Reddish is disposal and has been kinda a bust in his tenure with The Hawks."
I'd rather pay Bobby for $15 mill/yr than John Collins for $25 mill/yr
"Tom Chambers, John Collins, Byron Scott, and NBA Champion Sam Merrill gonna win gold for Utah /s"
Jason Collins. John Amaechi
"He was one of the most efficient 20 PPG scorers in the NBA. The dude just turned 23 and put up almost 24 ppg on 50-40? 8 players have put up close to those numbers before the age of 25 while taking at least 2 threes per game. Kevin Durant, KAT, Kawhi, Reggie Miller, Zach Lavine, John Collins, Shai and Chris Webber. So yeah he's not a role player."
Have at least decent ones like Time Lord or John Collins rather than Javale McGee and Kevin Love. Lol
There are better PFs too. We could have least gotten Aaron Gordon or John Collins or something at worst.
"You wanna talk about wasting draft picks? The Timberwolves (along with the Kings) are the true experts in this field that all the other teams bow down to  Selected Brandon Roy in 2006, good job. Immediately trades him to Portland for Randy Foye because reasons.  Drafts a Florida Gator in 2007, sound logic as Florida were back-to-back NCAA champions. But y'all took Corey Brewer and not future DPOY Joakim Noah  The Timberwolves drafts 3 point guards in 2009, none of them were named Steph Curry or even Jrue Holiday  They took forward Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins in 2010, if they didn't want a big man Gordon Hayward &amp; Paul George were also still available.  Another forward in Derrick Williams in 2011 despite drafting Johnson the previous year.   Acquires Shabazz Muhammad in 2013, a shooting guard that can't shoot or guard anyone. Out of the league in 4 years  Drafts 4-year college player Kris Dunn in 2016, he shits the bed in his rookie season despite being touted as ""NBA-ready"" and ended up being packaged in the Jimmy Butler deal (not that I'm complaining, he was decent for the Bulls)  Drafts Justin Patton in 2017 (John Collins was still on the board), dude gets injured in Summer League and has played a grand total of 296 minutes of NBA basketball since. Last seen on the Rockets"
"Go ahead and name the top 5 free agents now assuming Kawhi resigns with the Clippers? John Collins is gonna get 100+ million, Lonzo as well. Schroder ain't that worse than Lonzo."
Could they try to get a sign and trade for John Collins?
"I completely blocked out of my memory those DJ Wilson minutes  His nice NCAA tournament run led to him getting drafted too high (went ahead of guys like John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG Anunoby)"
"Hard agree. I wasn't happy initially about the doc hiring but thought he had a good regular season.  But God doc didn't make any adjustments in the playoffs. Just chilled and let curry get switched onto iso scorers the whole time, kept trying to have tobias iso John Collins when tobias mostly thrives against mismatches, sticking ben in the dunkers spot even though his best quarter of the playoffs was when he was featured as a post playmaker, Danny green on Trae in g1, bad rotations with too many ben-tisse minutes, I could keep this list going.    People meme him but ty lue is a significantly better playoff coach. Not sure I see us getting anywhere with doc unless morey can give us an absolutely stacked roster"
"I don't think we would cripple our team necessarily. However I do think if a trade would happen between us and the Wizards it would involve a SnT with John Collins, Huerter, one of Hunter/Reddish, this years pick, and a future 1st round pick.   Wizards are going to be asking a lot and understandably so considering Beal is a 31 PPG All-Star. However, since the Wizards would be rebuilding, I doubt they ask for Bogi or Gallo. The hit we take on defense is more than enough to warrant what we gain on offense with Beal.   I think both the Warriors and the Hawks have equally strong packages, but I also do think we have the strongest asset in Hunter as compared to the Warriors Wiseman. But that could be my bias talking.  Either way, TITS for me."
The price of the brick is goin up. Trae hasn‚Äôt got his max deal yet. Cam reddish looked like a created player out there. He‚Äôs like 6‚Äô10 now he‚Äôs a max player soon. Deandre Hunter is looking like Kawhi lite he‚Äôs gonna be a near max player. They‚Äôre gonna near-max John Collins. Shooters get paid Huerter is gonna command big money. Bogi locked in 3 more years. They HAVE TO  start making trades that‚Äôs not even debatable. Bogi already said it. It either true or let guys walk. So their motivation would be to get ahead of it
New York prolly going to max John Collins with their luck. Yeah they're not in a position to refuse Russ.
yes on the vet min and once cp3 goes there also on the vet min we can have cp3/lowry/bron/demar/AD with john collins and spencer dinwiddie coming off the bench also on the vet min
"I watch them all.  I have season tickets to the sixers.    Both are fine regular season players.  Tobi thrives on mismatches and Ben in the open court to get their offense.    Late in playoffs against Toronto, Boston and now Atlanta both have shrunk.    Stats don‚Äôt tell the story on Tobi.   He was outplayed by John Collins and scored 4 points in a loss, and went 8-24 in game 7 missing several layups.      It‚Äôs one of those things that unless you watch them religiously you can get fooled by numbers.  Just like you can not quite get what Ben going at the other teams best scorer on D every night does to free up Tobi to chill and worry about offense."
"Thank you for this question. Its a terrible contract.. people see the defense and passing but in truth draymond is what ben simmons was to philly this playoffs.. how can a25m/yr player be producing 7ppg.. he doesnt even affect winning without curry. When curry didnt play this season and dray did, warriors were 1-5..curry without dray warriors were 3-2. Draymond would guard a player to score 25pts and people will call him the best defender but he himself will score 2pts. Do the math and u realise he isnt helping them win. There was a game curry scored 57pts dray scored 2pts and warriors lost by 2. Warriors got blown out badly by the hawks and john collins had a career high in points in a game dray played and curry didnt.  In close games he is also a great liability down the stretch. Nobody guards him and they just double curry..in my opinion, if he could shoot, curry would be far more efficient.."
"Orlando Magic have been horrible at drafting for the last 7 seasons. They picked defensive specialist Mo Bamba 6th while SGA, MPJ, Sexton, Miles, Mikal, GTJ who are more fan favored offensive players were still on the board. They picked another defensive specialist the previous year at 6th with Mitchell, Bam, John Collins yet to be picked. Hell, picking Kuzma, Dennis Smith jr, Markkanen or Monk would've been more exciting for the fans. Dallas picked DSJ 9th who is basically out of the league now but they still sold the heck out of him in that one season of inefficient volume scoring and athletic showmanship. Going back further, they picked Aaron Gordon 4th who actually did generate some buzz and I'm sure there was no shortage of Orlando fans clamoring to see him succeed in the stands early in his career. The year before that, they picked Oladipo 2nd, who played like a prototypical volume scoring lottery pick and got the fans going but apparently he was also picked for his defense- WTF Orlando! Stop picking players for their defense in the top 6 when you don't have an offensive superstar."
"You could still take Tatum, Fox, Mitchell, Bam and John Collins in 2017 too. You have the picks in this scenario"
Oconnor never said you were shopping Beasley. He said the hawks offered John Collins for Beasley and a first
john collins
"Okay. That doesn't mean they're willing to trade him, plus Trezz would have to pick up his player option.  And if we're using that article they're going all in on John Collins."

"In a year like this where the free agent pool is incredibly shallow there are gonna be some huge overpays.  Unless Kawhi and CP3 opt out the only real All-Star level free agents are Lowry, Derozan and Conley and they‚Äôre just barely All-Star talent at this point.  That means teams are going to throw huge money at promising RFAs hoping their teams won‚Äôt match.  THT, John Collins, Lonzo, Jarret Allen, etc are all about to get paid!"
"I got a pretty hot one:   I think the Suns should let Chris Paul walk instead of giving him 3 years at 30plus mill, and should instead offer a max offer sheet to John Collins. Bring back Payne with early bird, find a good backup point with the full MLE.   Just, given the young age of that team, I fear Paul for 3 years at big money could become an albatross for their future ability to build a contender. And this is their one last shot at improving the roster using max space, and I just think that over the next 3 years, Collins on a max would be a either more productive or a better asset than Paul at 30 plus mill. Plus, the Suns could use more size, and Collins at the four would allow them to use them to shift some of their great big wing minutes to the 2 more, as well as give them the option to play Collins at the 5 at time -- overall I think it would make their roster more flexible."
"Disagree.  A two guard that‚Äôs exceptional at making tough shots and mediocre at defense? Where have seen that before? Sounds pretty close to Middleton.  Not saying that there‚Äôs another Giannis, but Embiid is pretty close to having that same two way dominant effect.   Pair a shot making guard like CJ with elite defensive personnel like the Sixers do, and he would for sure be good enough.  For reference, the number #2 players on the four conference finals teams this year were Reggie fucking Jackson, DeAndre Ayton, John fucking Collins, and Khris Middleton.  Only one of those dudes has ever made an all star game and they have zero all-nba team selections between them."
"Nah, this is exactly what i mean. +/- doesnt mean a thing.  Ben mad losing plays, john collins made winning plays. Hit shots when it mattered, big rebounds. Id take that over bens entire playofd performance any day. His effort level was abysmal."
"We played them. You don't think I watched the playoffs?  This is exactly what I mean. Yall are overreacting to one series. I'm sure Ben being a multiple time all-star and all-NBA player is because the coaches who voted him in have no clue what they're talking about and Collins would've made an all-star and allnba team if these coaches just watched more  basketball.   John Collins archetype of player is literally being phased out of the NBA. He is a pure 4 who can't defend the perimeter but also can't slide over to the 5. Id argue he's worth even less than the box score indicates, because he is giving up just as many points as he gives offensively.   Meanwhile Ben Simmons completely took their best player out of the series. Unlike Collins, he doesn't need to score to help his team.   Even though the Hawks won and the Sixers lost, Ben had a +/- of +29 for that series and Collins has a +/- of -4."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
Cool we'll take John Collins of your hands
"Fantastic stuff!      I'm worried about Williamson's future in New Orleans. I quite honestly think that losing Lonzo Ball will hurt the Pelican's future, because of Ball's chemistry with Williamson. We've seen it time and time again, an uber-athletic player just doesn't play to his potential and is shipped out to another team, only for that team to have an actual point guard and be able to utilize those athletic gifts. John Collins in Atlanta. Miles Bridges in Charlotte. Lob City's DJ. All of these guys are players who were effective before they got a point guard, but became elite because of a point guard. Case in point, I think losing Lonzo Ball's passing will hurt the Pelican's, and more importantly Zion's, offense.      That being said, I do think some of the skills are replaceable. Kira Lewis and NWA are solid and need another season's worth of evaluation, but look to be decent replacements. Ingram's scoring is there, and there's been a continuous upgrade to his half-court creation season-by-season. And Zion himself could become a better creator and finisher. But those are just what ifs. Losing Lonzo Ball's passing on the Pels isn't a what if, those lobs are on the money every time."
Did you watch playoffs at all? John collins is worth so much more than the box score would show and ben is the opposite.
What about Wiggins + #7 for John Collins in a S&amp;T?
"If BI isn‚Äôt happy, maybe trade CJ and something for BI. Somehow get Demar (I think he‚Äôs a free agent) or maybe sign Fournier. Defense would be an issue however so maybe try for John Collins although he‚Äôll be expensive"
"They need a big man. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes is a solid 1-3. Move Hield/Bagley/pick(s) for a 4 or 5, and sign a 4 or 5, and they're in the playoffs imo.   I've suggested before that they overpay for John Collins and trade Hield/Bagley/9/2023 1st for Porzingis. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/KP/Collins scratches the 8 seed I think"
"As a Portland fan, we traded 2 picks in an amazing draft for Zach Collins instead of Bam or Mitchell or staying put and getting guys like John Collins, OG, Jarrett Allen. This fucked us so hard. So, so hard. We had to hit in that draft and it was a great draft, and we just missed completely.  So yeah, your Gonzaga core team gargles ballsack like an NBA thot on all-star weekend."
I'd much rather get John Collins and a bona-fide backup guard on the MLE
RemindME! Two years ‚ÄúJohn Collins is not worth a max‚Äù
"Where John Collins ranks in Hawks history, according to bRef:  56.7% FG (1st) 61.5% 2P (1st) 60.6% eFG (2nd) 63.7% TS (1st) .162 WS/48 (8th) 122.0 ORtg (1st) 20.9 PER (6th)  Definitely not just BFF"
"John Collins is an above average forward with athleticism, decent 3pt shooting and poor defense. If another team pays him like he is a top 3 piece on a championship squad, have at it. He disappeared in the playoffs aside from a couple games in the Sixers series. You can never have enough shooters, but the Hawks have an abundance. He is replaceable."
"This is not a great season for free agency.   &gt; Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, John Collins and Spencer Dinwiddie are among the most compelling names to monitor"
"Well -- they are one of the biggest agencies and represent a bunch of NBA players. Including Jokic, Oladipo, John Collins, Kevin Love, Ingram etc."
"Gee I wonder who‚Äôs gonna be more successful the fella playing with:  Loul Deng, Dion Waters, Spencer Hawes, Tristan Thompson  Or the fella playing with:  Clint Capela, Deandre Hunter, John Collins, Bogdan, Huerter  Almost like the one with better players around them had more success ü§îüßê"
"He's due for a contract extension and he wants more than they think he's worth. Sort of like the John Collins situation. In addition, they have a better point guard in Darius Garland and they decided that Garland is probably their PG of the future ahead of Sexton."
Trae off the back board to john Collins
"Shows what you know.. Portis is actually pretty mobile for a big man and allows him to switch to the 4 spot seamlessly. Why do you think he was playing instead of brook Lopez. He does this while also being able to score from anywhere. He is like a John Collins. Teams would love to have Portis, he is an uncommon talent.   Let‚Äôs just ignore the fact Portis is already a much better scorer than KCP and hasn‚Äôt even scratched the surface of his prime. KCP‚Äôs prime is being a below average 3&amp;D, averaging 8-9points on mostly wide open shots and playing solid defense but only against smaller guards (he gets destroyed by larger wingers). Portis‚Äô ceiling is being a legitimate 3rd scoring option on a championship contender."
John Collins and Frank Kaminsky look identical
"Not joking, I'd rather pay Portis $12 mill/yr than giving John Collins a max/close-to-max"
"Raptors trade Siakam  Pelicans trade Ingram  Bucks vs Nets in the ECF  Lakers vs Clippers in the WCF  Lillard isn't traded  Zion's Pelicans crash the playoff standings at like 5th or so.  Poppovich announces his retirement from coaching  Celtics continue to look bad  OKC trades for more picks, water is wet.  Warriors squeak into the playoffs and get eliminated in the first round  The Bulls get into the spot the Knicks were in this season  The Hornets look surprisingly good  The Knicks regress  Hawks regress  John Collins will be the most consequential player to sign anywhere new this off season  Kawhi stays"
"Sexton is a solid player, he‚Äôs just not worthy of the max contract. It‚Äôs that simple - similar to John Collins in Atl. he‚Äôs good but not worth paying the max"
"If the player's young, consistently improving, has good size for the position and learned to defend his position, usually a good call (ex. Tobias/John Collins/Lonzo). Unfortunately for Shcroeder, he's the exact opposite."
John Collins just turned down 90 mil and got 125 mil
"Collins: Played for the team and didn't complain about his lesser role despite the contract year. Played whatever position or role what was asked of him despite posting 21/10 on 58/40/80 splits as a 22 year old the prior year.  Schroeder: Demands starter role despite being a 6th man on a lesser team, plays mediocre when actually given a big role during season, and fails during playoffs where it actually matters. Does dumb stuff like take off ""PG for the Los Angeles Lakers"" off his Twitter and Instagram mid playoffs and overall seems to demand more while not really giving much of value back.  Schroeder acted like he already deserved the contract without showing why he would deserve it. John showed the organization why he did."
Not really.  Sometimes you gamble and get rewarded like John Collins.  Sometimes you absolutely tank like Dennis.
Yeah that‚Äôs true for every John Collins there‚Äôs a Nerlens Noel out there
Collinson = John Collins
"I feel like this is going to adjust itself over time. As more players leave in free agency to other teams opposed to staying with their own teams, teams cap space goes down. Unlike most measures put in place by the NBA to try to stop super teams a bit, one of the more reliable ones to deter players leaving is bird rights as it allows a team to go over their cap space to retain a guy. The more players try to leave and go to other teams, the less cap space that's available, meaning guys can't just keep getting paid in free agency by other teams when no one has the cap space to pay them.  John Collins in previous years would have likely gotten a max offer from another team, but most teams are trying to fill out their roster and once that's done they don't have room anymore."
"I'm talking the concept of the contract, rather than the exact numbers. If we waited till next year to extend him, he'll get an additional 10mil in each year, as he made an All-NBA team. That would be a brutal overpay, and getting that contract extension done now, at a cheaper deal than what he could've gotten now as well, is fantastic. Same as John Collins, he didn't get the max as that would be an overpay, but still got his bag."
How is it John Collins money?
"Higher on Cam Reddish than most I think. I'll just paste a comment I made a few days ago about his FG%  &gt;I don't think it is though. He shot 46% from 2P% this year, Covington for example shot 45.1.%. Danny Green shot 43.8%.  KCP also shot 46%.   &gt;The main reaosn his FG% is so low is because his 3PT shot is in the low 30's wheras the other guys are in the 40% range, and also, he's taking 5 2PA's a game while the other guys are taking 2.   &gt;His archtype is a very switchable 6'8 wing. He just needs to shoot 3s and defend. As long as he ups his 3P% while also cutting out some of those non-3's he'll be fine. I would 100% take him on my team no questions asked. He's still big, has great lateral quickness, and is a good ball handler for his size.  Also probably higher on Poeltl. I think he legit needs to be in DPOY discussions and hope he plays 30+ mins this year.   Way lower on John Collins than most. I think his archtype no longer has any place in the NBA. Pure 4 who can't guard the perimeter or play the 5 defensively. To me these players will always be negative players no matter what their offense look like because they can't guard anybody."
You are trying to move the goalposts now and say they have to fit your specific criteria before it meets it. I don't need to because I'm not trying to fit your specific criteria. I don't care about it.   Players have been critical of their teammates forever. So have coaches. From Shaq and Kobe to Jordan and every one of his teammates that he's bullied and chastised. There's a reason why we know about Phil Jackson calling out Kobe and telling him to grow up. There's a reason why the story is out there that Jordan punched Kerr. Whether it's direct or indirect its all the same. They put it out there to send a message to the player to step their game up.  This article also clearly states that Clint Capela and John Collins talked down on Trae's game. Collins confirmed it and then just said that no matter what they're brothers. I'm thinking Collins and his agent put it out there to The Athletic because of how they intro'd him but you can believe what you want. You just sound really young and haven't watched a lot of NBA to see that this is normal.
"Except when it has. Example, the Hawks sources went to the media about teammates being unhappy with Trae Young's decision-making and Young adapted and they made it to the ECF.  John Collins basically said in front of the team that Trae was hurting them all with his reckless play.   https://theathletic.com/2307304/2021/01/08/atlanta-hawks-john-collins-trae-young/"
"Lol you got people worried about Randles $ and the Hawks paid JOHN COLLINS 25 mil a year to Randles 29. Are you kidding me. John Collins who cant create his own shot, cant defend, and is basically an athletic Max Kleber. This is fair if not good value for Randle."
How about teams with multiple players that have been all-nba. That would be more indication of success. I mean John Collins is a superstar in ATL.
That‚Äôs a lot to pay someone who had about the same impact as John Collins.
"Sorry your reading comprehension needs some work, let me try to make it easier for you   Led a team that was universally projected to be a bottom 2 team in the league to a top 4 seed in the playoffs with minimal talent, while making the All NBA Second Team and playing anchoring a top 3 defense in the league as the number one option. He gets paid ""John Collins"" money without having to be a 3rd option and got ""exposed"" because he's the only guy on a bad team who can actually create his own offense."
"damn, seems like john collins is significantly more effective in his role than julius ‚Äúregular season‚Äù randle is in his"
sorry i misread that as ‚Äúnumber one option in the playoffs‚Äù not lead his team to a 3 way tie for the 4-6 seed in the east then shot 29% from the floor on his way to a first round exit. the reason this dude just signed an extension for ‚Äújohn collins money‚Äù is cause he got straight exposed
Cool. Let me know when John Collins is the #1 option on a playoff team.
john collins fg% in the playoffs is nearly double randles
"It‚Äôs 28m over 5. John Collins just got 25m. If he continues to play like he did last season, Absolute steal."
"Lol when you think of it as John Collins money it looks even better, and I like Collins"
We giving him John Collins-type money and it's considered an overpay. Classic lolknicks.
"The NBA only gives little bans for drug cheats like Ayton and John Collins. They give huge bans for addictive recreational drugs like cocaine, meth, heroin etc.   OJ Mayo and Evans got hit for a year so they they were on the latter."
"A lot of these players are betting on themselves, and betting wrong. John Collins got smart and took that money."
"yes, like i said, he‚Äôs not an elite primary playmaker or initiator. he‚Äôs a secondary playmaker who capitalizes on those situations at an elite level  executing off the short roll is a really valuable skillset that many bigs don‚Äôt have. look at the hawks last year. trae got doubled and john collins was unable to convert on many of those 4v3s because while he‚Äôs an elite finisher he had awful passing ability and vision.   it‚Äôs something that looks easy but is hard to consistently execute at an elite level"
I'm sure if Trae Young or John Collins called looking to buy an Rolex's for an entire team multiple ADs would be more than happy to sell him  a couple of SS for MSRP given how much they're spending to outfit an entire team.
He seeing how much John Collins getting.
"I mean watching Trae foul bait was giving me hemorrhoids and John Collins pisses me off, but at the end of the day Jo does a similar strategy (albeit less egregious) and the team gels so well and they're fun. I love the Sixers, but I also just like watching basketball and Atlanta is good at basketball."
That‚Äôs still too much in my Humble opinion. 5/100 was the max I would give him. Not winning a chip paying John Collins 25 mill a year
"Same, if Trae gets hurt, then I hope John Collins turns into a 125 million dollar tank commander and we deal off some of the contracts we are likely going to have to anyway in the coming years."
"Steph, Trae, Draymond, KAT, John Collins. Hawks, Warriors and T Wolves were worst 3."
I might be a Sixers fan but I respect John Collins for flying all the way to the UK a few years ago to come say hi to people at an NBA event and chat basketball shit that us cunts never really get to hear over here. Pretty sure he did the same over in France too. Top guy.
It goes deeper than that  [John Baptist Collins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Baptist_Collins)

I love John Collins. Good for you big dog.
"When Thibs started giving him minutes off the bench when Knicks were injured in the front court later in the season and the playoffs, he showed a lot of promise and developed quickly.  He can knock down corner 3's, he's elite in transition, okay in the post, but is terrible on defense and not the best at handling ball or playmaking.  Give him more minutes and development under Thibs and I'm sure he will become a better defender since he has a motor and passion.  All in all he will develop nicely into a strong PF in the league I'd compare him to a John Collins level ceiling."
"yeah I wouldnt even be mad at giving powell the john collins contract, he's great"
Let‚Äôs fucking go!!!! Absolutely love John Collins and he‚Äôs earned every dollar he‚Äôs due from last years playoff performances against Embiid and Giannis
"Young and Collins just signed huge new deals. Sometimes in pro sports when a star player gets a massive new contract, they‚Äôll buy their teammates a gift as a sort of thank you. Hill is joking with Young and Collins that John Wall bought him a Rolex in a similar situation in the past, so the implication is that he‚Äôs expecting something from them now, as well."
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
"I watched every game Franz played at Michigan and he is definitely not a 4 in his current state. He‚Äôs not strong enough to handle players like Julius randle or John Collins. His strengths are that he‚Äôs long, moves well, and has smart iq on defense."
I don‚Äôt understand why someone didn‚Äôt just make a max offer. Either they screw over the hawks with the match or they have John Collins who is a pretty damn good player
"No you weren‚Äôt lol  https://www.bloggersodear.com/2017/7/18/15989216/john-collins-nba-summer-league-first-team-lonzo-ball-josh-jackson-dennis-smith-caleb-swanigan  &gt; His mind numbing dunks have also caught the attention of Sportscenter, as well the Twittersphere, and Hawks Reddit, who has coined him ‚ÄúJohn the Baptist‚Äù (I can‚Äôt believe we didn‚Äôt come up with this quite frankly given Wake‚Äôs former Baptist affiliation)."
"I'm sorry, I was unclear. I was talking about John Collins in that comment, not Lauri.  I'm not a Lauri guy at all."
"It definitely would kill super teams unless the players colluded to take cuts to play with each other. I think Tobias Harris and Wiggins should probably only be making max 20-25 million a year. Lebron should be making 40 or 50 million depending on his prime. John Collins was holding for a max contract. Idk, the whole league is nuts now. Players have a good year and think they need a max."
"I'd have happily given him (Edit: him=John Collins) a 4-year, 25% max. He's a 40% 3 point shooter, not a terrible defender, and he's a vertical spacer...and he's just 23.   Even if he never gets that much better, he's probably worth pretty close to that, and I think he has room to provide surplus  value on that deal."
BUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN REGARDING JOHN MARTIN COLLINS III?
"Unless they are secretly trying to get John Collins, I have no idea what the hell they are doing. The Celtics have 3 good players in Tatum, Brown and Smart. I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt spend money and get another scorer or playmaker"
"I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt get a first rounder in return... like the bulls expect to be in the playoffs. Why would they care. Matching and flipping him would have net that return, also they could have went around signing guys like John Collins or Devonte or plucking Monk, anything but what they did."
"If I was ATL I would try to avoid Tyler Herro syndrome and sell high on the young guys who performed in the playoffs.  S&amp;T John Collins, Kevin huerter, reddish and picks for KAT or Siakam"
John Collins
probably waiting on John Collins
Cool so can John Collins re-sign with the Hawks now that nobody else has money to pay him
"Okay you're ALL OVER the place with this one.  &gt; Considering what is happening in Brooklyn, you hardly have an argument for the city here.  Brooklyn? That's virtue of a superteam and the difference should be VERY obvious. Knicks are also NY, yet aren't getting shit for FAs. You hardly have an argument for the city here.  Expectations? Bruh Jalen Johnson is a freshman 5 star recruit outta Duke arguably as athletic as JC, longer than JC, 4 years younger than JC and actually shot more than JC did in college. Not to mention he can actually dribble a bit better and flashes playmaking ability - two things that JC struggle with mightily. JJ is a good prospect and a GREAT value pick at 20.  Hawks re-signing JC is the priority and its keeping me up at night but in the event that Collins wants to leave, Jalen Johnson is the prospect I want in his wake. Nowhere do I even imply that I want him to replace or become a max contract player, just that we have him if John forces his way out and we aren't ""without any option"" as you claimed.  &gt; So We are talking about max contracts and you bring up 35 year Rondo who commited a robbery on you  Rondo - easily Hawks worst move last offseason - but what robbery? He was traded for Lou Will (helped us get to ECF), 2 future 2nds, and cash. Lou Will salary just came off the books while Clippers are still paying Rondo $7.5m this season. Its kinda funny to watch you babble on when you dont understand what you're talking about.  Where are you getting this stuff about max players?! You realize there's an entire spectrum in between the minimum and maximum contracts, right? Here is [John Collins' BORD$](https://i.imgur.com/n0CKmvS.jpg) valuation. It's a near certainty, given salary cap landscape of the league that Atlanta re-signs him closer to the $26m/yr valuation than the max.  Atlanta VERY MUCH has a choice and them not being NY, LA, or Miami doesn't change that like you claim.   #Hell, at this point in FA John Collins is only a max player if the Atlanta Hawks say so."
"Hawks FO and John Collins - let me know if you're gonna let me know, yeah?"
"There's John Collins still up but he's an RFA.  Reggie Jackson and Schroder are still up, I guess."
"Can‚Äôt find an updated one but the biggest people left are kawhi, Reggie Jackson and John Collins from what I can remember"
"Maybe there was a John Collins sign and trade somewhere in there instead of DeRozan? Maybe there was a deal for Ben Simmons if they kept a bit more flexibility? (Not that I think Simmons would be worth it, but he does have more All NBAs than LaVine and Lonzo combined.) Maybe Jokic gets pissed about something and wants to go to the team of the guy that drafted him?  Can't predict the future, but as a major market if you have some flexibility and young assets you can look to grab big names when they get unhappy. Worked out well for the Lakers, Clips, and Nets. The Bulls going all in with mediocre talent while giving up picks just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me."
Yeah but if it's John Collins then that contract is 5 years so it runs right alongside that extension. He'll be due a year after next season. Doesn't really matter now though
John Collins: That is Schroeder money. Am i like him to you?
there's no knock on John Collins  there just isn't money and one has to sign an offer sheet to get matched. He maybe just didn't sign any he liked.
"Ok, so you're a non-hawks team. Free agency day starts and you take all of your cap space and offer it to John Collins and he accepts your offer. You now cannot offer that money to anyone else while the Hawks take the entire 72-hour window to tell you that they're going to match the offer.  Three days have passed. Everyone (except Schroeder) has been signed. You're fucked.  Has nothing to do with how good the rest of the league thinks John Collins is."
John Collins would be good in Dallas
Okay John Collins agent. We get it. You want money and he wants money.
Because anybody that has ever heard John Collins speak thinks he‚Äôs a really cool dude with a good head on his shoulders. He‚Äôs as real as pro athletes come.   He just has an opportunity to sign a contract that will change his life and his families life forever and he wants to maximize it.  Has nothing to do with arrogance.
"Nerlens, Oladipo and potentially John Collins lol"
Flip Dennis for John Collins LeGM
"Same. Love it.   We didn't even get Markkanen from y'all, and John Collins is off the table."
Mom: We have John Collins at home.  At Home:
john collins: holding out for a max contracg  matt2486: [‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/Z-Frah8fcfo)
"It's funny how mad i am at John Collins. I don't know him, i've never met him. But i'm mad as a fan. We had an insane season last year. He is not a max player. I get wanting to get paid what your worth, but 5/125 IS FUCKING GENEROUS based on how he played last year. He just isn't that guy. Sign the damn deal. I don't see anyone going above that and if they do they can honestly have him. He's one of my favorite players, but it would be stupid to pay him much more than that. The issue is it would break up our core that we drafted our asses off to get. The alternative is he does a 1 year prove it deal and likely still doesn't hit that max performance and ends up in a worse situation. Take the bag dude. Annoying."
That is a great deal for the Spurs. Sucks for John Collins.
Add John Collins and they will
Is John Collins here? Are you who behind a Burner? Because when did I ‚Äútell‚Äù Collins to sign it? I was talking to someone who was commenting on how pedestrian his postseason play was and you decided to jump in with your no information having ass lol.   Be quiet
Nope. Unless we trade Aminu and Thad into other teams‚Äô trade exceptions we no longer have the cap for John Collins. Congrats on retaining him!
John collins
John Collins could be a nice get for y‚Äôall. Not sure who else would use all the cap
"Can't lie, to me the MAX is for two folks:  - Young stars who are bubbling  - Young stars who you need to anchor your team  I just don't think folks have heard of John Collins like THAT. With all of that typed....if his agent meets in the middle with say 130M then that's a HUGE win and is also why we shouldn't involve ourselves in this mess.  I though anticipate he just dont' wanna be in ATL and believes he'll have a good season and sign elsewhere."
John Collins is safe
Yes. Now we can offer a max to John Collins.
Does this take the Spurs out of the John Collins hunt?
"DeRozan, Schroeder, Kawhi, John Collins, Oubre, Reggie Jackson, Markkanen, Kendrick Nunn"
That's a lot of money for John Collins tho
Fun Fact: If they add John Collins their average age stays at 23.
I don't think it's a coincidence that remaining cap space fits a John Collins max offer.
Spurs need John Collins first. Then can s'n't for Markanen. They cannot go all white on frontcourt with White on backcourt.
"""major cap contorting"" or Sign and Trade with San Antonio.  They really need the S&amp;T, but the Spurs most likely want to offer sheet John Collins (based on their available space). So they either need to wait for a potential Collins offer sheet to be matched by Atl or make the offer good enough that the Spurs drop the Collins idea."
My projections  *  Kawhi Leonard (LAC) * Demar Derozan (DAL) * Dennis Scrotum (OKC) * Spencer Dinwiddie (WAS) * John Collins (ATL) * Josh Hart (NOP) * Victor Oladipo (BOS) * Danny Green (LAL) * Andre Iguodala (GSW) * Patty Mills (SAS) * Reggie Jackson (LAC)
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
Only 2-3 teams can still sign John Collins without doing an S&amp;T.  Wonder how he feels about San Antonio.
"This is probably what will happen, but I think they are trying to see what happens with John Collins first?"
Still a bunch of names out there yet to sign.  -  John Collins  -  Reggie Jackson  -  Danny Green  -  Melo  -  DeRozan  -  Dipo  -  Oubre  I know I took a bit of a nosedive at the end but still solid names.
"Damn right, If the Atlanta Hawks have any chance in hell of getting John Collins on a minimum deal, you do what the hell it takes. Period!"
Will give John Collins and deandre Hunter for Anthony edwards and KAT and 32 first round picks
Waiting for everyone to spend their money so no one can offer John Collins.  Same thing Wizards are doing with Dinwiddie.
"Even if he shows he is the same player he was in 19/20, someone will throw him more than that. Dude has too much upside as a switchable 7 foot rim protector who can shot 40% from 3 on ~8 attempts a game. I would rather bet on his upside than John Collins' for example. Injuries are a problem though, and if he can't get through 21/22 injury free then that might change things"
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
John Collins is a human pogo stick I stg üò§üò§üò§
"Trae was averaging 9,3 assists the year before with John Collins suspended for 25 games at the start of the season with Alex Len, Damian Jones and Bruno Fernando as his bigs.  Basically the type of bigs he has is irrelevant to how good of a passer he is"
"Atlanta is a poor example here. Capela did elevate us from last year and the year before when we had the likes of jabari Parker and Alex Len playing in the middle, but to say that our wing defense was soft is not that accurate. Deandre Hunter, until he got hurt against Philly, was shaping up to be one of the premier wing defenders in the league. He‚Äôs a guy you can put on the other team‚Äôs best player and forget about it. Same with cam reddish, except he was out the second half of the year and only played ECF last few games. Bogi and K‚Äôvon both solid team wing defenders. The biggest weak spots on the hawks D are Trae Young against the opposing ball handler, and John Collins against bigger PF and Cs."
"When has Tatum played at an All-NBA level on defense? He‚Äôs certainly a solid defender but he‚Äôs also had great defenders around him most of his career which tends to buoy defensive numbers. Hunter was averaging 18 before he got hurt last year and was in contention for MIP. It‚Äôs really not that outlandish to think he‚Äôll build on that next year. Not to mention John Collins, who‚Äôs averaged 20 &amp; 10 before while proving to have a reliable 3 point shot, being a solid defender and being an elite roll man. Hawks have a bonafide star in Young, a guy who could easily make an All-Star game in Collins, Hunter who also could easily make an All-star game. Not to mention useful role players with potential like Reddish and Huerter."
"Tatum isn‚Äôt better than Trae and DeAndre Hunter is on pace to be as good as Brown pretty soon. Not to mention that the Hawks also have John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Okongwu, and Reddish"
Gotta give credit to bogdanovic and gallinari for sure but you have to give value on at least John Collins and De'andre Hunter.  Collins been solid and has been putting up good numbers and could be a borderline allstar type talent maybe more. Hunter has been injured but prior to his injury he was balling out on both ends of the court. both are young guys with loads of potential
Now add John Collins and the balance shifts back toward the Hawks.
JC? John Collins? Why is he more likeable than other all star players?
I think they mean John Collins
"Sure, he could. The risk/reward of turning down contract extensions. Worked this year for John Collins, not so much for Schroeder.    Given his injury history, I think he‚Äôd be foolish to not secure the bag, but he could absolutely end up making the right call if he turns down the extension and then balls out."
"I went to an ACC school and got to see Jabs roast my team live twice, he was incredible as a freshman in college.   That said, Michael Beasley was better. The guy averaged almost 20 ppg over 73 games in 2016-2017. If he could‚Äôve held it together personality wise or even accepted a three a d role, he‚Äôd still be a valuable contributor to an NBA team. He‚Äôs so good the nets even gave him an opportunity to play for them in the bubble (ended up not working out because he got COVID sadly) and I do not doubt he could‚Äôve given the nets at least 15 ppg and 8 rpg off the couch.  Jabs‚Äô game, while injuries definitely hurt his career, was never going to translate as smoothly to the nba as Beasley‚Äôs. His ceiling was probably John Collins if were being honest (no knock on John Collins but he‚Äôs no MVP), Beasley could‚Äôve been an all nba guy."
"Very Good but not even best on Hawks, thats John Collins.üòä"
"The best big man Giannis had to play past was Bam, who played the worst he's ever played. Then he had to go against DeAndre Jordan, who all Nets fans unanimously agree is a net negative. In the ECF, he had to face John Collins and past his prime Capela. Giannis played remarkable, he played like a finals MVP, but it's a neanderthal take to just say that Harden hasn't ever played better than Giannis' averages without contextualizing any of it."
"Why does everything have to be a superlative? He is in that elite tier of guys like Giannis, Zion John Collins, AD and a handful of others.  Its stupid to try and argue he is or that any other single player is when I don't believe there are lob specific statistics out there. He certainty pulls off some absolutely crazy ones and gets almost his whole arm above the rim sometimes."
John Collins and Zion exist
"Not going to argue too much for defence, but having a guard that can defend the likes of john collins, capela &amp; ayton, probably was key for a defence like Milwaukee‚Äôs.  I do wish he didn‚Äôt shoot as much, his awful shooting was likely a combination of fatigue from chasing booker/cp3 around screens + lack of team sets for him.  However to say that he is bad offensively, or that he is close to Marcus Smart is wrong IMO. Jrue Holiday is the primary playmaker of a championship team, just averaged a series high 9 assist in the finals with the best Ast/TO ratio against the Point God himself. CP3 wasn‚Äôt exactly surrounded by scrubs either. Bridges, Crowder, Booker, Ayton."
If John Collins is a max player then Ayton is one as well.
"The Hawks now have Trae Young locked up through 2027, John Collins and Kevin Huerter through 2026, and Clint Capela through 2025"
"John Collins was a free agent this summer and y‚Äôall are planning to tank again this season, so of course he doesn‚Äôt fit the timeline as well. Assuming y‚Äôall get a top draft pick this year you end up with SGA and 2 blue chip prospects. Adding ayton to that can only do good things for your team, even if a max is a slight overpay at current production   You aren‚Äôt going to get any free agents anyways, what are you trying to even save cap space for lmao"
"Seriously, people are talking about him like he is Drummond. Last season, he shot:  * 77% from 0-3 * 52% from 3-10 * 48% from 10-16 * 32% from 16-3P (low sample size) * 20% from 3P (very low sample size)  While shooting 77% from the free throw line. If he learns how to draw fouls like most other big men, he will be a problem. His Free Throw Rate (FTr) last season (FTA/FGA) was 25%, Gobert, Embiid, and Jarrett Allen led centers (&gt;5 FGA) with more than 60%. A lot of starting centers are in the 35-45% range. Even Jokic, who notoriously can't draw fouls is at 30%. If Ayton can bump up his FTr up to 35% and his FGA go up closer to his sophomore year (14 FGA), while maintaining his career average 59% FG% and 76% FT%, he can average 20 PPG with elite defense. He can definitely be much more than the one-dimensional player that he is sometimes painted as.   IMO, he could pull at least John Collins money ($125M/5Y). Embiid/Jokic got $148M/5 on their first contracts (2018) or a 25% max, but both were more proven or at least bigger parts of their teams success. The cap has gone up though, so something like $150M/5 would probably be fair, though he may be able to get more with a good contract year. Max extension is a bit of an overpay but you keep your players happy.  [Free Throw Rate Reference](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-centers-2021-highest-free-throw-attempts-per-field-goal-attempts-with-at-least-5-field-goal-attempts-per-game)"
"I mean you're a hawks fan. The way the media talked about John Collins made it seem like he was done with the Hawks, but he still signed a deal. Wouldn't place too much weight into that stuff"
"Serious question, would the suns be better or worse with John Collins as starting centre over ayton. Good move prioritizing bridges over ayton imho"
"As a long term suns fan I actually don‚Äôt mind extending bridges and waiting on ayton. Like mentally he collapsed in the last 2 games and if you replace ayton with a John Collins, would the suns be better or worse?"
Listen I understand where you are coming. When John Collins was adamant about a max and we were able to play it through his final year and sign him to a smaller deal without him getting to antsy. But realistically Ayton still has tons of more potential and his argument for one is much stronger. He‚Äôs not even the worst max player in the draft class. The Suns coming off a finals run would take a massive lost if he‚Äôs walking because unless he‚Äôs injured next season someone is offering a max and I can‚Äôt see how Sarver changes his mind if what he sees isn‚Äôt enough.
"Am I the only one that's shocked by the amount of backlash the suns are getting for this decision? Is it because they went to the Finals? Or because Ayton is a #1 pick? Or because the owner is a known tightwad so he won't get any benefit of the doubt?  Because when you just look at Ayton's profile he is not currently a max caliber player, and the Suns retain the right to max him next year if he makes a leap or even if he doesn't they can match whatever else he gets offered. I understand it can lead to hurt feelings down the road but this is a \~180 million contract we're talking about, I think it makes sense to be patient and not rush into something they might regret.  This is exactly what the Hawks did with John Collins: we low-balled him last year, he asked for a max, we didn't reach an agreement. Then he had a productive 2020 season and the team was very successful, but he didn't make any sort of personal leap in terms of his development. There were rumors about no less than a dozen different teams offering him a max that we would have to match or let him walk, and none of that materialized so we ended up getting him for 5/125 and everyone is happy."
So what?  Ayton is not the only player who could elevate the team. There's zero reason to get him today. The team is in no position to compete.  We could have sent an offer for John Collins. We didn't.  There will always be restricted free agents or players who want to be traded. OKC will not send an offer. They simply will not.
"I‚Äôve watched plenty the idea of JJJ has always been really good, meanwhile John Collins is actually really good."
"Anyone who thinks the Suns fucked up here needs to look at the John Collins situation. Same exact thing. JC wanted a max, Hawks didn't blink, media hyped up a mid-season trade, that didn't happen, then they hyped up the possibility of an offseason deal with another team, that didn't happen, then he got a contract that was fair value for both him and the team. The only consequence of note was a way better cap sheet for the Hawks.  In order for someone to pull him away with a max there needs to be a team with a max slot that's willing to throw down on Ayton. He's really good, but he's not a max player, and I think front offices know that. Not to mention that that extent of cap space is almost extinct nowadays. (And IMO Michael Porter Jr. wasn't worth a full max either - rare mistake by the Nuggets FO)"
"I think it'll be fine.  If Ayton plays well this year, the Suns will offer him a max contract the following year Or he'll get a max offer sheet from another team, which the Sun will match.  If Ayton doesn't play well, the Sun's have the possibility of signing him to something similar to what John Collins (5/125) or what Jackson Jr (4/105) got.  It's very unlikely the Suns will lose Ayton to another team or Ayton signing a QO.  This is ofc barring trades or Sarver doing something incredibly cheap and stupid."
"I can understand the logic, it worked for the Hawks and John Collins  But in my opinion Ayton is legit enough of a player at 23 years old where you just give him the max early and try to avoid a situation where he's unhappy or trying to force a trade. Would be shocked if no team offers him that in RFA"
Maybe John Collins? He won't do it this season but the year before Capela played for us he took 14.8 shots per game and averaged 21. He can't really create his own shot outside of face-up mid-rangers. If he played with a big that could stretch the floor and allow him to do more rim running along with his three point shooting he could probably get close. If you're literally just talking about rim running then obviously he doesn't fit the answer you're looking for.
If he stays healthy that‚Äôs a great deal for Indiana.   That‚Äôs Buddy Hield and John Collins money.
"So complete rebuilding teams, and ones that could easily end up drafting bigs instead. Jalen Duren, Yannick Nzosa, Wembanyama, etc. in the next couple drafts.   People also thought the Spurs would try to max John Collins and that didn't happen, so I don't think that's even as guaranteed as people think."
There's no chance OKC offers a max for Ayton.  We could have had John Collins on much less but we didn't even try lol
"I agree best ability is availablity. If you're not playing, you're not helping your team.  But if JJJ can stay healthy and continue to develop there is a chance this can be a complete steal of a contract. Just compare to the contract John Collins got for putting up very close to the same numbers.  Obviously it comes down to durability, avoiding repeat injuries, and getting back on his developmental track. Medium risk, high reward contract extension imo."
"While I agree with you about JJ, I think y‚Äôall are underrating John Collins. The dude averaged 20-10 his sophomore year. Then 22-10 his 3rd year. He‚Äôs also a 40% 3pt shooter (albeit low volume but he can stretch the defense much the same). He just shot 56-40-83 last season and 58-40-80 the season before. While JJ has a high ceiling, John Collins looks like a future star as well. He is a great scorer, rebounder, and can defend."
"It is less likely but maybe Suns don't want to pay him that much and they S&amp;T him. Teams are going to offer him the max. Even if they retain him for a max, this is going to sour relationships. This isn't some John Collins shit. Ayton was a near all-star level player last playoffs."
"IDK, JJJ and John Collins didn't get the max, and Collins actually got to RFA. Similar-tier mid-career guys like Capela and Myles Turner are nowhere close to the max.  If you're in the market for an offensively-limited rim protector like Ayton, you could try and trade for one of Turner or Capela, or if you're patient make a run at them in '23 UFA (I think it's likely both change teams).  OKC in particular I have to imagine could get either of those guys if they're desperate for competence at the center position."
But he has proven to be clearly better than John Collins...
John Collins is a worse Center tho
John Collins is a better shooter.
he managed to get more per year than John Collins? that feels wrong
John Collins is way better than him lol
"DeRozan is an established veteran who you can trust to run an offense, John Collins is already better than Wiggins while being almost 3 years younger, and Buddy Hield's contract is widely considered a massive overpay.  And before you say that Wiggins is basically as efficient as Collins, 65% true shooting vs 57% is an enormous difference.  I'm confident Wiggins will get a sub-$20m/yr contract once his max expires. But he'll still get paid decently."
"Nah, he's definitely one of the people that's suffered the most from being overpaid. He went from a promising young center who'd be the centerpiece to OKC's defense for years to come to a guy making $25 million a year for 10/9. He's a good starting center but comparing salaries, he's in the same pay range as Vucevic, Jalen Brown, Demar, John Collins, Julius Randle and other players of that caliber.  If he were 12-16m a year he'd be a good piece on a good contract who can rebound, dunk and defend the rim."
"Maybe but he was also still considered a more valuable player at the time he signed the deal.  I love Bridges but there are almost no 3&amp;D wing / elite role player types like him who make more money than what he got.  They all have some major scoring/offensive ability as a featured option, or at least a highly plausible upside in that regard.  I guess you could say John Collins but he's a completely different kind of player, and he barely he got anymore than Bridges on a per-year basis, with a stronger negotiating position because the team was out of time."
"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x9LSGdJ3_L4  And yeah, I was looking at the wrong year, but 17-7-1 on 55/39/85 isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsignificantly better‚Äù than 19-8-5 on 48/39/75. Wiggins could definitely defend Kawhi/Lebron/Booker better than John Collins could"
Yes rookie John Collins is not worth 23 million dollars.
"Kyrie, AD, Zion, Rob Williams, Nurkic, John Collins,"
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
Derozan‚Äôs paid $26 mil and Buddy Hield and John Collins are paid $23 mil.   Wiggins is a 26-year-old SF/PF (most important position) averaged 19-5-2 on 47/38/75 and played great d  He‚Äôs definitely in the $26-23 mil range
[Here I'll look](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  * DeMar  * Jaylen  * Draymond  * Vucevic  * Buddy  * John Collins  So he's as good as them or better?
"He can't really create his own shot and his stats look way better this year cause he's playing with arguably the best passer of this generation. He's good for sure but 22.5 million good? He's getting paid more than Vanvleet, sabonis, lonzo and around the same as John Collins and vucevic. I would say around 17 million is would have been good like OG"
John Collins didn‚Äôt get a max.
He'll get the John Collins max
5) Clint Capela  4) De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  3) John Collins  2) Kevin Huerter  1) Trae Young

"John Collins is an absolute legend in the making. The nickname, the constant poster dunks, the t-shirts, the bromance with Trae. Only thing is I wish he would have made the airplane dunk, it's the only blemish on his record"
John Collins talk way too much s$&amp;t for him to basically be a non superstar. Damn at least Draymond back up his talk. I‚Äôve seen Collins go missing
"Kinda fair but I've watched over 70% of John Collins career games and he has been quite good without Trae as well. It's a given that he benefits from Trae but Trae benefits from him as well. Excellent with the screens and his roll timing, incredible hands (best in NBA), and incredible upper body &amp; core strength to have an elite ability to finish through traffic and fouls either in the air or from the floor under the rim going up."
Also didn‚Äôt help that John Collins posterized like half of their starters multiple times lmao
"I love John Collins, so happy he‚Äôs staying with us."
"BAH GOD, Young with the leg drop! John Collins just tore his quad!"
John Collins is the highest paid Atlanta Hawk.
"John Collins in 2018, probably: ‚ÄúBen Simmons was making jokes about our team while playing video games online? Okay, fine. From that point on, that‚Äôs all I needed. I took it personally.‚Äù"
"Yes, John Collins is the correct answer.  Third-highest salary on the Haws is Clint Capela."
On this topic why does John Collins not get talked about more  Over the past two seasons he's averaging like 22/10 per 36 minutes on absolute top tier efficiency(65% TS)
"*John Collins kicking dirt into open wounds.*  Damn John, those men have families."
"Cool, then let him play out the year and pay him next offseason.  Hell, if he's beasting all year make him the maximum qualifying offer (5 years, 8% raises), which would require any RFA offer sheets to be at least 3 years.  Aside from Ayton's (and apparently Suns fans') butthurt, what's the downside to waiting to ""max"" someone that even you acknowledge is not really worth it?  The reason to max him at all, *as you explicitly acknowledge*, is leverage.  This offseason, Ayton has none.  Also there have been very good players that have signed for less than their max (but in the same ballpark), such as Jaylen Brown, John Collins, etc... I'd argue these are closer to Ayton's peers than Luka and Trae, especially considering the relatively small sample size of Ayton playing anywhere near a max level.  MPJ... I'll give you, but how much of that is guaranteed?  There are many ways for an agent to say his client got a ""max"" contract, and the details matter.  The issue with Ayton and the Suns could be as simple as the Suns not offering a player option or trying to include some likely incentives (i.e. games played).  Speaking of peers, you (and others) are comparing him to wings and primary ballhandlers, who have more value than a traditional center.  Only 4 true centers have a max - KAT, Embiid, Jokic, and Gobert - and each of them was far more accomplished than Ayton (and, aside from situations against the few teams that can go 5 out like last year's Clippers, are far more valuable).  AD and Bam are the other 2 ""centers"" at the max, and they're both better (and more versatile, although Bam needs work on his range).  The next tier of centers is Capella, Turner, Allen, etc... Is Ayton closer to AD or Capella?  Jokic or Allen?"
East:   Sharife Cooper - Bogdan Bogdanovic - De'Andre Hunter - John Collins - Clint Capela üòà
"Ayton getting the 'John Collins' would be a fair compromise for both sides but it's pretty clear it's no enough for him. They should try and find a way to get close to the max based on incentives but Ayton has no personal incentive (well, depends on the priority but let's assume it's to maximize his money) to take less than a max because he's likely to get one in RFA.  Mikal's agent has failed him if he gets less than 85 over 4."
But we waited with John Collins and it worked out. Not saying it will work out with Ayton and the Suns but Collins was a RFA and ultimately resigned with us without it killing the relationship.
What would you be comfortable paying Ayton? 5 years/125M? I'm thinking John Collins money is the floor.
Thats not a fair comparison. John Collins can shoot
A rich mans John Collins is a max wtf lol. If he is your second/third option you are fine in the long run.
Is it just me or do John Collins and Jordan Poole look like they could be related? Kind of like Norman Powell and Andre Drummond.
John Collins didn‚Äôt get the max. He got 125mil/5. That‚Äôs probably where the suns want Ayton.
They can create there own shot. Ayton is the number 3 guy who can‚Äôt score unless it is set up by cp3 or booker a max for a rich mans John Collins ain‚Äôt it
"I think Ayton probably ends up getting a max deal, but I wouldn't be shocked if he has to sign something like John Collins either."
"I agree with the sentiment, but that situation really hasn't happened yet. It would be a game changer if it did. The most likely outcome is they match any offer sheet that comes down. Ayton could end up in a John Collins situation. There really isn't much downside for the Suns."
"The peers he is talking about are likely other rookies who got max extensions. That list also includes guys like John Collins, Bam, Fox, and Michael porter Jr.    I think aytons agent has every right to say ""every rookie who plays like an above average starter gets a max extension. So why not my guy?"""
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, K√©vin S√©raphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
"John Collins wasn't a #1 overall pick, that was probably just his agent trying to get that dude a yacht but he knew he wasn't ACTUALLY a top 5 forward in the league that deserved max money"
"another example is John Collins who was a Restricted Free Agent this past offseason.  He wanted a max, was reportedly pretty angry with Atlanta for not offering the max, he eventually signed for Atlanta's original offer anyway which was less than the max.  It's difficult for an RFA to make demands."
Does John Collins count. He just got his max. But I hate the way he played in Milwaukee series.
"lol it‚Äôs kinda the same problem the hawks have, 4 guys can be argued after trae. Hunter on defense and shot creation, bogi on absurd three point shooting, capela on defensive impact, or John Collins on stretching the floor and putting the ball in the basket at insane efficiency"

Can someone p/s Simmons head on John Collins  baptism of Embid?   Then have the gif of him falling away after Kawhi ‚ÄòBen Simmons‚Äô Leonard hits the jumper in his eye.
"When you talk about depth players, I don't think anyone expects them to play more than 20 or 25 minutes so I'm not sure what your point is lol   &amp;#x200B;  No one brings up Atlanta's depth and says ""yeah man they have Trae Young and John Collins""  &amp;#x200B;  Those aren't the people you refer to when talking about depth"
"Ayton will be an RFA, so if the Suns want him for the next four years, they can have him for the next four years if they're willing to pay the max for three of them. There's no ""bailing"" for a restricted free agent of his caliber.  The only major thing they risk by playing hardball and going into RFA is the option to have him for an additional two years on the max (5-year, no-option max vs matched 3+1 offer sheet from another team), when Chris Paul will be _checks notes_ 40 and 41.  Especially with how the John Collins situation played out, I think the Suns are doing the smart thing. I don't actually think OKC or Charlotte are that interested in tying up cap space for three days by signing Deandre Ayton to Schrodinger's max contract."
üôè for John Collins' knees. That dude dgaf
Ayton is not so much better than non-max players like Jarrett Allen and John Collins that he is a clear max guy.
Funny how John Collins did the same shit (as far as falling on his ass after a high lob) but no one says shit lol AD can be fragile but he‚Äôs fine. Worse is when he lands on one leg after jumping up. I just get Giannis hyperextended his knee flashbacks whenever big men do that. Rather see em land on them cheeks instead.
Yeah we could‚Äôve walked away from that draft night with Jimmy Butler and John Collins.
"I'm pretty sure most of the Heat sub wanted John Collins not Zach, which would have still been a good pick. I remember him being a favorite, especially since he went to high school in South Florida."
Justin Patton.  A raw center we drafted with the 16th pick. When we needed a defensive SF/PF. And OG + John Collins were still on the board.  I guess that sort of fits with the DJ Wilson of picks that didn't make any sense +injury. So not sure if it counts as a bust.
"couldda drafted OG Anunoby, John Collins/Jarret Allen, and Derrick White with their picks"
"Zach Collins.  Blazers traded up for him and he was pretty much a complete whiff.  Also painful considering who went after him (Donovan Mitchell, Bam, OG, John Collins, Jarrett Allen)."
"That draft will haunt my dreams forever. Portland picked Zach Collins with Bam, Mitchell, OG, John Collins, and  Jarrett Allen still on the board."

"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"

"Everyone outside Trae and John Collins aren't as decisive with the ball. They don't make split second decisions and opt to reset and iso.

"One of the Hawks - whether that's John Collins, Bogdanoviƒá, or Hunter"
Defensive rim running bigs are not hard at all to find generational offensive talent is. The wolves liked John Collins apparently if people really want swap him for Capela and then try to trade Capela for some defensive reinforcement on the perimeter to make up for some of the losses
"We‚Äôre talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
"Coming up next! Bam Adebayo, hot or not? And staying in the Southeast, John Collins, certified cute or give him the boot? We'll talk it out with Brian Windhorst"
The John Collins to Clint Capela connection is my favorite thing of this new season so far.
"What are those guys giving up? It seems like you're envisioning some star for star/really good players trade. Atlanta will be leading with John Collins because he can't be on the court with KAT, Raptors don't seem like they want to trade for  star at all right now, not sure what the Knicks and the Celtics are giving up that are of high value unless it's one of their stars whom they won't offer obviously, and well, I'll give you NOLA in terms of assets but I'm not sure exactly what the point of constructing Timberwolves 2.0 is with Zion, KAT and Ingram in the frontcourt. That team would be leaking points in the paint."
A John Collins (iirc he bet on himself so he got that huge contract now)
John Collins is a good example why
"Tra eneeds to learn to play his position, he is surrounded by so much talent and just wants to be an inefficient shot chucker. It‚Äôs clear he isn‚Äôt getting to the line like he used to so why not he evolve with the game, and play a little defense and get players like Reddish/John Collins/Hunter/ &amp;Capella going often and early and score when needed."
Didn't John Collins come out?
Hawks get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Juancho Hernangomez (filler)  Celtics get:   * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * John Collins  * Cam Reddish  Hawks end up with the best player overall. Celtics turn two really good players into three really good players.   Hawks run Trae/Brown/Huerter/Hunter/Capela  Celtics run Smart/Bogdanovic/Tatum/Collins/Horford with Cam Reddish off the bench
"He‚Äôs not a defensive anchor as a 5 but he‚Äôs athletic enough to play the 4 and he can space the floor. He doesn‚Äôt really need the offense catered to him since his game is pretty well rounded as a face up big, paint finisher, and shooter. He‚Äôs like Trezz if Trezz could actually shoot and play the 4 which would be a valuable player.  Wood is comparable to John Collins with better handles who‚Äôs already shown he‚Äôs a valuable piece on a winning team. Not a franchise corner stone but a great 3rd option for a winning team."
"Ja, John Collins."
"Trae still looks like Trae and might lead the league in assists this year so that‚Äôs cool. John Collins looks like he might get some All-Star votes and has improved his ball handling/passing. Cam Reddish looks like he is our 3rd best player which is really exciting but also kinda bad at the same time lol. Hunter doesn‚Äôt look to good, Bogi started shooting again I feel good about this team and think we can finish as a top 3 seed in the east. We have a lot of picks and young talent so there‚Äôs always a chance we make a move for a star at the deadline so that‚Äôs exciting as well."
"John Collins had 6 assists last night. He's averaging 3.1 a game right now, up from 1.2 last season.   It adds such an incredible element to our offense that wasn't there last year if he can sustain it. The lobs he's throwing to Capella are honestly unguardable and I think JC's a really smart player who's basically realized that as well.   There's been a lot of disappointment with underperforming early in the season, but Cam/JC and to a lesser extent Trae have all added something to and evolved their games in the off-season.   Cam with his shooting and improved passing.    JC with his ability to find assists under the basket this year   And Trae with his(WIP) midrange game to keep defenses more honest.   When this team finally hits it's stride and finds their offensive ""Flowchart"" I don't really know what the defensive scheme would be outside of desperately doubling Trae and hoping nobody else can facilitate.    We get easily frustrated by officials, so maybe run traps on Trae and hope they allow for physical play/borderline fouls against him? Once he's frustrated with the refs his game takes a step back until he can recollect himself."

"Ew we caught a case of the Sixers, next thing you know John Collins and Nate McMillan are gonna roast Trae Young in the post game presser until he demands a trade."
"We literally picked DJ Wilson over John collins, jarret Allen and og so not like we would have done anything with the pick."
John Collins is so damn good
Even Ayton took 3 seasons to really reach a certain point. Also John Collins did slow roll into a better player.
Something I love about the hawks is how their bigs pass to each other. Fun to watch John Collins to capella assists down low. This and last game.
 John Collins being a capable passer makes our team so much scarier once we start hitting our stride.   I honestly can't stress how huge it would be for our offense if he can keep making these assists.
No offense to John Collins but teams are gonna be willing to tie up cap space for Deandre Ayton. He‚Äôs a legit #1 pick who‚Äôs over shadowed by being in Luka and Traes class and on Devin Bookers team. He‚Äôs probably one of the most talented big men in the league while also being one of the best all around defensively and he‚Äôs only 23. His floor is being an elite rim runner who can hit his free throws and his ceiling is being a bigger bam adebayo. The suns are fucking up with a great talent just because he‚Äôs not luka.
Could work out like the John Collins situation where no team wanted to tie up their salary cap space for 3 days while their offer inevitably got matched.  Depends entirely on how well the NBA prevents tampering in the offseason.
Steph Curry Jimmy Butler Kevin Durant Giannis Antetokounmpo Nikola Jokic  Ja Morant Paul George Miles Bridges Karl-Anthony Towns Joel Embiid  Lonzo Ball Derrick Rose John Collins Montrezl Harrell Rudy Gobert
TJ Leaf over John Collins
Could be closer to the John Collins deal but I wouldn‚Äôt mind giving Miles the max either
Don‚Äôt forget Zach Collins and John Wall
What do people think about him getting John Collins level money? Still too much?
"Okay Trae is the best player on the Hawks right now but he is at his absolute ceiling, Reddish, Hunter and John Collins can all honestly be better than Trae in 2-3 years. Reddish and Hunter play defense, and there offense of game has huge room for improvement, Traes defense will never improve and his offense is will never be more than what it is"
"This is not true. I've watched nearly every Hawks game since John Collins was a rookie and Trae drew a majority of his fouls from stopping where he was and going straight up with his shot because defenders sold out to try and defend him by chasing full speed around screens to not give up the 3 or lob/floater combo.   Also, trae is still averaging 25/10 while getting consistently hand checked on his drives, smacked in the face, pushed in mid-air off the court, his arms and hands slapped on shots &amp; layups, and him getting near bear hugged by guys reaching for steals while getting what is essentially no calls from that."
"2017 - John Collins  2018 - Trae Young, Kevin Huerter  2019 - Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish  2020 - Onyeka Okongwu  2021 - Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously I'm biased but I'd say the Hawks have drafted better. Every single one of the guys on this list has starter level upside (if they haven't realized it yet) and are going to cause a money squeeze on the Hawks because of how good they all are. The Grizz probably have picked guys better equipped to be rotation and role guys but the Hawks seem to have a lot of guys who would be on a lot of team's starting lineups"

john collins revenge game
"You can name 20 players better than Ben simmons... one of the 14 all stars last year and was first seed in the east I might remind you.   For a team to be super it has to have 3 all stars who are top of their positions.   It's not right now hence the post saying in the future, but trae is definitely a top 5 pg, with Ben simmons, and Tyler hero the way he's balling this year can be a top 10 shooting guard.   * John Collins is a 18&amp; 10 big man who can shoot the 3. So Ice trae, Huerter/ hero. Simmons and Collins. Would be crazy."
"Your saying a 6'11 all nba defensive  first team all star isn't good enough as the 20th best paid player in the nba...   If harden kyrie and durant contracts can line up as well as westbrook a.d. and lebron. I think Ben simmons, trae young, with a Tyler hero and John Collins can match."
"If Im Atlanta I would do OG Anunoby for John Collins.   I dont think Toronto would though. I wouldnt either Collins isnt a 5, I dont want to be paying Collins a max to have JC at the 4 and Siakam at the 3."
The Mavericks don‚Äôt have assets that the Hawks would want...  Your picks are useless and you have no young players that are tradeable and at the caliber of John Collins.
Not if John Collins has a down year or is made redundent
"There isnt really a compromise past lottery protected which is already favorable for Atl considering their leverage. The Hawks clearly dont think John Collins is a max caliber player, it's very possible they might not even match a max offer sheet for him next summer that pay roll is gonna get absurdly high even beyond how they value him as a player.  Giving up this much just for the right to give him that max when you either might be able to get him on the RFA market next summer makes no sense."
John Collins on a max isnt worth a top 5 protected pick for a franchise like Charlotte. Especially when you are also giving up PJ Washington
"It was my initial suspicion after the Okongwu and Gallinari acquisitions happened. Then people like Zach Lowe predicted that they would end up reaching an extension with John Collins still, there was enough buzz I kinda cooled off on my initial thought process. And I could still see them doing it, but yeah it's very possible he is gone.   I agree the role he's in just entirely being a play finisher on pick and rolls isnt what he wants, and it's not going to change as long as he's in Atlanta. Think it would take a max for him to seriously consider staying with Atl, and I dont think Atl is gonna voluntarily offer one. The question is if another team gives him a max offer sheet this summer will they match, definitely get why you suspect they wont.  Ive said in the past this is also partly why I would explore Collin's trade value right now. But it's a fine line to tread they really want to make the playoffs this year. If I could trust Gallinari to stay healthy it would be alot easier to"
"The Hawks haven‚Äôt had bad player development though   Trae Young, DeAndre Hunter, John Collins, Kevin Huerter are all players who improved a lot under Pierce. Even Reddish improved a ton through out last season.   It‚Äôs more the GM‚Äôs fault for making their roster so reliant on young players, while also having glaring holes in their roster last year. Now that they have a more complete roster, we can judge Pierce more accurately"
"So the head coach and John Collins have an issue with Trae. Seems like Trae is the issue here. But Trae is the star, so they should fire the coach and trade Collins."
"Yeah I think itll continue to lead to tensions after a certain amount of time. Those who win will probably have more leeway and sustainability with how long their teams let them go with it.   But at the end of the day this league is about stars and ultimately that leads to enabling them, I suspect over time if this really becomes an issue Lloyd Pierce will be gone and if Trae really forces their hand they will pick Trae over John Collins next offseason and Trae will get what he wants. That entire Houston culture people have Zach Lowe have talked many times how it was enabling Harden. Same thing happens with alot of young stars,   Trae's defense hasnt been as atrocious this year as the first 2 but Im gonna need like half a season not 8 games to actually buy he has improved to some extent on that end. Him getting away with being as much of a joke on defense as he's been is also a byproduct of him just being able to get away with it and enabled to some degree."
wow him and john collins. better send trae to detroit.

Leaf is absolutely hot garbage. His rookie year he was an unathletic 4 who could occasionally hit a 3 ball. Then our team decided to have him bulk up and become a center which somehow made him even slower. In addition his 3 point shot went to absolute shit and he had a horrible stint in the bubble where he got blocked like every other fucking attempt. He was a good team mate but I weep for the fact that we couldve had john collins or og anunoby instead. Leaf was a huuuuuuuge bust.
Honestly curious but may I ask for examples of this? Top of my head are AD and John Collins but I believe they‚Äôve always been PFs but in today‚Äôs game would be be better suited at the 5. The Celtics are employing a Thompson-Theis frontcourt which is interesting. Even the Spurs who for the longest time utilized a 2-big lineup have shifted to a 1-big lineup since last season‚Äôs bubble.
with john collins as his side kick
"DeRozan and Butler is a pretty awful pairing given the ball dominance and lack of shooting (also, what‚Äôs the source of this rumor?).   He drafted Dunn over Murray and Hield, Justin Patton over OG and John Collins, and signed Gorgui Dieng, Cole Aldrich, and Jeff Teague to big free agent deals.  Not to mention he butted heads with literally everyone in the organization. Dude isn‚Äôt a bad coach, but he was bad in Minnesota. Maybe he learned. Maybe not. We‚Äôll have to see how things look in a season or two."
"Trae Young, John Collins, Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter and Clint Capela for Gordon Hayward who says no here?"
Maybe?  Not sure if the playoffs will help him this year but I guess we will see. There‚Äôs going to at least one big that‚Äôs a RFA in John Collins.
"Trae Young John Collins Cameron Reddish DeAndre Hunter Onyeka Okungwu Bogdan Bogdanovic Kevin Huerter or Clint Capela  The expansion team would likely be a lap to choose a solid bet from either Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, or Rajon Rondo"
Don‚Äôt forget John Collins!
"&gt; I can see flipping dray for like Aaron Gordon or John Collins  Total junk. Dray isn't gonna get traded untiil the final year of this contract, at best."
"Well obviously not but paying max money to a non superstar seems a little counter productive to me and I think if they could trade him for an existing piece that is a lot cheaper and possibly make a finals run, who is a level above Collins and would probably deserve a max contract. That‚Äôs my opinion and I‚Äôve seen articles and yt vids about John Collins trades that‚Äôs y I brought it up here"
"The thing is the max was given to Tatum, Mitchell, and I think fox. Barring fox is John Collins really at the level of Mitchell and Tatum?"
"Dray aint gone age well.   On offense he‚Äôs already at an athletic deficit (never a threat to finish at the basket on the 4 on 3).  On defense he‚Äôs still getting to spots hella early and his second jump is hella quick.   What he does with the ball in his hands is nice, but it‚Äôs less valuable when there are actually good players on the team.  I can see flipping dray for like Aaron Gordon or John Collins when klay and whatever wing we get with minny‚Äôs pick get here.   That‚Äôll still give us a chance to win now while extending our run, because curry and klay are probably gonna age great. (Nash &amp; ray alllen)"
"Trae's move is pretty obnoxious, but lol John Collins in the background making fun of Austin."
Definitely agree that it's running basketball. The foul baiting. The complaining. It's gotten soft to the point of it being unwatchable. There's no physicality anymore.   Look at how john collins is even complaining about how rivers isn't getting a tech.
John Collins snitching üòÇ
"hawks fans, john collins isnt usually this good right????"
"Outside of the players you mentioned, I think Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, John Collins and Brandon Ingram would play. Myles Tuner or James Wiseman would be solid if USA needed more depth at Center."
Fox/Levert/Derrick Jones Jr./John Collins/Brook Lopez
Not sure about Luka but I can see a good chance that the following superstars stay:  * Trae Young * De'Andre Hunter * Cam Reddish * Bruno Fernando * Brandon Knight * Kevin Heurter * John Collins
A big man that can't protect the rim or shoot 3s/playmake is out of the league. Unfortunately he's looking like a poor man's John Collins right now.
"The team wasn't ""made"" to do that, he just had pretty mediocre pieces around him besides John Collins who missed 25 games after the drug/steroid testing or whatever. Teams knew he was the only player on the court worth worrying about, he still put up almost 30 and 8. The team was absolutely atrocious without him on the court, so his +/- of -4 or something along those lines was not very relevant. I hate using this argument, but watching him play added to his crazy good stats makes him easily elite in my eyes."
John Collins obviously chills with the hottest dudes. He's with Trae
The NFL suspends people for a significant amount of time for these type of things. I don‚Äôt remember any NBA players getting suspend for these but I could be wrong. Typically they‚Äôre 4 game suspension which would be 20 games during the NBA year. Last one I can think of that length was John Collins.
"""huh?"" - John Collins"
John Collins touched a ref. Suspend him! /s

All my homies love John Collins
The dudes who are on steroids never get caught. It‚Äôs those who take contaminated OTC workout supplements that get popped all the time.   Anyone who thinks John Collins is on more juice than Dwight Howard is an idiot.
"This is a strange claim, but this might be the GOAT de-escalation move. Don't try to drag your teammate away, instead try to smooth talk the ref into a cozy Netflix date. While your teammate is cussing his way in to the locker room, the ref will be distracted by thinking of a lie to tell his wife to explain his absence.      John Collins is my MVP frontrunner at this point."
"They were ok but alot of these guys are really starting to blossom after leaving. I saw an upvoted comment about the Hawks just last night saying their drafting can't be considered that good until they actually make the playoffs and they drafted Trae Young and John Collins.   The Lakers picked high alot and if LeBron didn't come over they'd still be stuck in lottery purgatory. At some point you have to say ""hey, this team isn't drafting THAT great if they aren't a playoff team with 3 2nd picks and multiple other lottery picks"""
"Not that I disagree, but I feel like every single young good player in the NBA is described here as ""gonna be a multi-time all-star""  Not that I'm opposed, I love the optimism, but we definitely pick hype trains and ride them.  This includes me. Everyone aboard the John Collins all-star hype train."
Everyone need a John collins homie
Can i say his comparison is John Collins?
"If this were really a possibility, maybe a S&amp;T with Atlanta around John Collins and picks."
John Collins best basketball player ever out of my hometown.  West Palm Beach? FL
If Collins keeps yamming on people the way he has been John the Baptist will be one of the great contemporary nicknames.
John the Baptist Collins?  Kevin 'Ron Threesly' Huerter?
John Collins missed a dunk...that was the game in a nutshell.
Dante Exum put the clamps on John Collins.  You guys are disrespecting the elite defense right there. Embarrassing.
"I love John Collins and sometimes he comes up really big but he really needs to raise his consistency, he has way too many games where he's not a big factor for as good as we know he is."
John Collins is seriously a person who I would like to be like. Dude is so positive and finds a way to make people happy. Hope we don't lose him.
Good guy john collins
John Collins will be an all star this year
I wanna see John Collins on the Mavs
"Trae Young is better than Luka  Trae Young is top 3 for MVP   Hawks making Finals, or at the very least ECF  John Collins All-Star"
"WEST  PG - Lillard  SG - Harden  SF - LeBron  PF - Wood  C - Jokic  Reserves - McCollum, AD, Doncic, CP, Steph, Kawhi, Gobert   EAST  PG - Trae Young  SG - Beal  SF - Jaylen Brown  PF - Durant  C- Embiid  Reserves - Sabonis, Kyrie, Sexton, Tatum, Giannis, John Collins, Drummond"
"Hawks this year are pretty stacked. They added capela, gallinari, and bogdanovic. Plus they have a full season of john collins."
You are tripping john Collins hasn't done shit in the nba yet. 18 and 7 aren't even close to allstar numbers. And its only 5 games into the season cool your jets
"Lol don‚Äôt ruin your day getting worked up over a John Collins argument. I‚Äôm sorry bro but the Hawks can‚Äôt LolKnicks themselves through an argument, their last championship was 1958. Knicks have double that üòãüí™üí™"
"1. John Collins is going to get paid. He is fearless, has an eye for the ball, highly energetic. He had so many cuts to the basket and when it wasn‚Äôt there he would take a solid mid range jumper. He‚Äôs high energy without being out of control.   2. KD and Joe Harris seem to be meshing more on court than him with Kyrie. Kyrie still seems to play like he doesn‚Äôt have any other scorers around him and their were many possessions where he got tunnel vision. If he‚Äôs on point then let it fly but the shot wasn‚Äôt dropping."
"John Collins is good for sure.  I mean he's not as good as ""any second option"" because teams like the Lakers have AD or LeBron as a second option.  I'd argue that like most top teams have a better second option.  Second, don't confuse his continuous improvement with stardom.  I think Hawks fans are high on the fact that his stats have improved every season, but he's still a 20ppg guy.  Those numbers probably stay the same or go down now that there's actual talent on the roster and other players have improved.  He certainly isn't worth a max but he's going to probably get a max from some team if it's not the Hawks."
did you draft any of them? No. Now sit down and be grateful you have a John Collins and not Kevin Knox. Lol.
The name John Collins has strong founding father energy
"There are multiple young second options I‚Äôd rather have over John Collins lol. Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, DeAndre Ayton, Brandon Ingram, just off the top of my head. He‚Äôs a good player but he‚Äôs not a superstar."
"Could have gotten something decent for him at some point last year or even this off-season by including him in 3 team deals. It would have been easy.  And it's ok, you gents have Delon, and went after Lee too. Could add another vet min PG also.  Anyway, it is what it is. Wood looks like a borderline max player now, like John Collins. I wanted the Wizards to give him what they gave Bertans, but we only signed him with his bird rights."

"Trae is a better player than KAT and John Collins is miles better than whoever the next best player on that wolves team was.  Then you have two 2nd year lottery picks who are just now becoming comfortable with the NBA level of play, Bogdanovic who is an already solidified baller, Capella who has shown himself to be a geed nba center, Gallinari proven shooter and overall scorer.  This isnt some fluke team that's doing well, this is a team that has matured into a mid-level playoff team."

Still can't get over Nique saying THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A FACIAL off the John Collins dunk in the 4th..
Watched John Collins wack him all gam
Hawks looking real good.. they‚Äôre gonna have to pay John Collins a lotta money.
"GM's still haven't learned that lesson either.  Take a look at Brandon Clarke, who fell to #21 last year and then got traded for the #23 pick+a 2nd rounder.  **Brandon Clarke Senior Year Stats** (Technically Junior Redshirt year)  * **Offense**    * 16.9 PPG       * 69.3 eFG%       * 69.9 TS%    * 3.1 ORPG    * 1.5 TO/g * **Defense**    * 3.2 BPG    * 1.2 SPG    * 5.5 DRPG * **Advanced**    * .337 WS/40    * 16.3 BPM    * Fun Fact: As many Blocks as Misses (117 Total)  And when he came to the NBA, he proved that he could take it to the next level.  Last year, Brandon Clarke lead all rookies in WS with 5.0.  His OWS put him in the range of CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Brandon Ingram.  His True Shooting% of 66.3% in his **fucking rookie season** lands him at #5 in the NBA between Jarrett Allen and John Collins.  He's struggling this year, but he'll pick it back up.  I am curious though on when GM's will learn that a college senior does not mean they are weak prospects."
Hawks gonna pay John Collins
Atlanta sign and trade John Collins and Cam
my dumbass drafted john collins over him
Pay John Collins immediately
If John Collins makes every 3 it will be hard
Don‚Äôt sleep on John collins
West: Jazz because I like Mitchell and their offense is fun to watch  East: Hawks because I like Trae and John Collins
John Collins + Hunter/Reddish seems fair  &amp;#x200B;  ^(/s)
"I think there's a chance they try to land a player like John Collins, a stretch big who is underperforming on their current team."
"I mean I guess, just depends. Like John Collins I would not count as a wing. Same with Giannis, AD, etc."
They would give John Collins 20 games
A little like John Collins too
fuck ESPN could‚Äôve used John Collins. I hate Trae Young‚Äôs face
John Collins at 19 - Hawks
1. Kyle Korver 2. Domonique Wilkins  3. Paul Milsap  4. John Collins  5. Trae Young  6. Steph Curry  7. Kevin Durant   8. Giannis  9. Siakam  10. Sabonis
yeah lol... McMillan hasn't even had who was our best player before his injury -- De'Andre Hunter.  I don't think anyone in the NBA world knows he exists.  I keep reading article after article about how Randle is going to cook John Collins when Hunter will likely be the primary matchup
He spearheaded a top 5 defense with a very limited roster. What John Collins did one night means nothing.
Thats a joke. He has been great last twenty games or so but was not that good a large part of the season. John Collins embarassed him to the tune of 38/12 on 74% shooting. Its mostly a popularity contest for awards now.
Dude you tripping. He has been fantastic in second half of year but he wasnt that great first half of year. John Collins embarassed him (38pts 12reb on 74% shooting). Teams dont alter their gameplan to avoid Draymond.
I don't think we're gonna move off John Collins at this point. Kinda wish we would if there was a good trade out there. I don't think his impact is gonna match the big-ass contract he's due to get.
Deandre Hunter if John Collins is gone would be a good pick.
Joel Embiid 29.5  John Collins 4.1  Giannis 27.5  Jrue 26.1  Doncic 8  $95.2M
Your analysis on the knicks was fine but on the hawks was seriously lacking. Also your final analysis is made off wrong data.   Neither Bogdon nor huerter were or are currently hurt. You listed John Collins as primary randle defender when it will likely be Hunter. You got our likely starting line up wrong. And you left out Gallo and Lou Will who will both be very important roll players
"I wanna see if John Collins gets destroyed by Julius randle. if he defends well, the Spurs probably throw him a bag and make the Hawks match."
"Now I'm just picturing the Hawks squad lined up on the baseline holding whistles and quivering, while Nate counts down from 10 in anticipation of the players all having to swallow said whistles.  Trae is crying, John Collins is getting more convinced that it's time to leave, Lou is coating his in hot sauce, and Bruno Fernando isn't sure what's going on."
"If he's getting 25 mil/year for 4 years, then John Collins is getting ""super-duper, times infinity"" maxed."
"As a Hawks fan hoping for a small John Collins discount...screw you, Cleveland."
This probably raises the price for a John Collins contract. I wouldn't mind the Hawks giving Collins that much or a bit more though.
"Hahaha yikes. Didn't mean to upset you my friend. It wasn't a total abomination of a trade but we definitely won. I remember when the trade just went though, everyone thought that we had given up a first and were still cool with it.  If only NO didn't suck at drafting. We had 3 FRPs that year and ended up with Collins (always hurt) instead of Mitchell, Bam, OG, John Collins, Jarrett Allen. Hell, we could've had 3 of those players."
I think they shouldn‚Äôt target John Collins
Also said to leave John Collins open on the perimeter like he hasn‚Äôt shot 40% from 3 in each of the last 2 years. The worst part is his absolute refusal to admit he was wrong.
Haven‚Äôt really watched the Wizards this year but what do they need to be contenders next year? It seems like they need a quality 3D forward(maybe a John Collins type guy) and a decent bench PG.
Hornets could use john collins
The issue is the Hawks play a boring ass style now since Trae stopped running and gunning.  All that complaining about Trae and now the Hawks play like that team at LA Fitness where everybody watches the one in shape dude dribble the air out the ball in the half court until he passes it at the last second.  Bogi and them are cool and all but I need some excitement. Watching Trae little ass shoot from half-court and John Collins catch lobs was the least they can do. Now John doing awkward post ups and Trae is either gonna throw the lob or shoot the floater.  The price of winning I guess.
"Bank on Ayton playing like prime Shaq in the playoffs, getting a max, and then falling off to somewhere below John Collins right after"
Spurs offer John Collins a fat contract (say 4 years 80 million) and the Hawks don't match
I‚Äôm especially impressed with Atlanta. i know it‚Äôs a pipe dream but i really want John Collins to sign with Dallas...
"No sir, quite the contrary. John Collins is Trae‚Äôs best friend!"

"That would be John Collins, who was born near a military base in Utah"
"Honestly, it took me a while to figure out what you were saying and not because of poor phrasing on your part.  I believe that you're saying that Danilo Gallinari, De'Andre Hunter, Clint Capela should be listed along with Carmelo Anthony and the rest of that group, but the ""third best on their team"" would be either John Collins or Bogdan Bogdanovic."

"your 3 best players, trae young, john collins, and clint capela all played 62-63 games 10 more than jimmy butler. but ok. i mean if my team had their 3 best players for 87% of the season i wouldn‚Äôt act like my teams other injuries were so impactful"
"We're definitely short a front court player, adding someone with size and range would make this team scary fast. It's why spurs fans have such a hard on for John Collins, but we'll probably end up sending Lauri Markhanan an offer instead."
Hawks in 6 imo. Without Embiid clint capela and john collins can work. The best hope the 6ers have is pray that ben simmons locks down trae
"exactly, they traded up to take a big when there were options available where they were organically in the draft.  If they grab one of either John Collins or Bam and then use their other picks to get off salary this could be totally different.  Imagine John Collins next to Nurk in the front-court, providing spacing, scoring and rebounding for this team."
"The only defense for drafting him is invalid because if you say you wanted a big man Bam And John Collins were still available, not to mention trading up to get him.   I asked because I was genuinely curious and I couldn‚Äôt figure it out on my own lol"
"he'd have to be better than the rip city hive believes he is (and a significant chunk of them think he's really good.  I had one of them tell me Collins had ""legit unicorn potential"" and that he was clearly better than John Collins).  They traded 2 picks to get Zach Collins and surpassed multiple All-NBA players and one of the best wing defenders in the league to draft him.  You can say hindsight is 20/20 and maybe people had no idea Bam/Mitchell would be as good as they are, but even still the Blazers had 3 firsts in that draft and a bloated cap table, it probably would've been a better move to pay someone to take ET/Meyers/Harkless off their hands instead of drafting Collins who couldn't beat out Meyers Leonard for minutes and hasn't been able to stay healthy or put together 2 good weeks of basketball in 4 years."
"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
"I can‚Äôt name one, but I‚Äôve got a list: Clint Capela John Collins Goran Dragic Jusuf Nurkic Mikal Bridges Miles Bridges Garrison Matthews"
"John Collins maybe,  people are joking here but I honestly wouldn't hate getting like KCP and Caruso or something. Idk I haven't looked at the numbers."
Is there a worse player in these playoffs than Kuzma. Dude is hot ass and Lakers fans said he was better than John Collins. Lol
"I'll be happy to answer some questions for you!  &gt;Like, are we SURE the Hawks are good? All we hear is Trae young this Trae young that, but......  ** The Hawks have one of the best records in basketball since Nate took over, i believe its the best record in the East. They have a lot of players that can handle the ball and make threes, as well as a few great defensive players which is a big reason why the Hawks had the best 4th quarter +/- once Nate took over.  &gt;We hear about all this talent, better team, blah blah blah.  ** Correct, now we do. Before the playoffs 16 ESPN analyst went 14-2 for the Knicks winning the series. That was the general perception in the media, Hawks losing in 6. Almost nobody in the media watches our team and when they do they finally see that we actually have a lot of depth and a PG capable of being a superstar in this league.  &gt;Clint Capela? Always outplayed in big games with Houston. The same guy that shrunk against the Warriors is Now apparently Young‚Äôs perfect PNR sidekick  ** He's 26 and Harden also got outplayed in big games in Houston. You can say that about a lot of Rockets. Hes been a top 3 rim protector in the league this year and an elite lob threat and rebounder.  &gt;Nate McMillian? Never won in the playoffs with Indiana and Portland  ** Do you know how many series they were actually favored? How many times he got fucked by injury, or LeBron, or Kobe? He didn't win a lot but there's really only 1 or 2 series that he probably should've won but didn't. That's not terrible, and he's also obviously adjusted his coaching style some bc a lot of his criticisms centered around his rotations but its clear hes been more willing to make changes. Your team doesn't have the best 4th quarter +/- if your rotations are shit and the players don't like you so he must be doing something right.  &gt;Bogdan? The guy who put up empty stats on the nets/kings. And BTW That MIL tampering think was bullshit. He should be a Buck  ** Hey you're probably right about one thing, he should be a Buck. But he's not. He has a bigger role in Atlanta than he would in MIL and Nate has Bogi playing the best ball (statistically) of his career. He also had some huge buckets this series against the Knicks and all season for us so I don't think any Hawks fan or player would consider those empty stats.   &gt;John Collins? The guy with that awful dunk contest  ** I will not tolerate this JC slander. There's a reason hes got the nickname ""the Baptist"", plus his initials are the same as the big man himself, James Cameron.  &gt;The Knicks, with a possible COY and MIP and defense and those crowds lose to........  A team that basically quit on Lloyd Pierce  ** LP alienated himself from his players to the media by failing to take accountability and having his players backs on a regular basis. If you lose a locker room in 2 years, and vets as well as rookies can't stand you then you're probably fucking up as a coach. Hes not Popovich, he hasn't won shit and obviously doesn't command the type of respect needed to coach the way he tried to coach. We had lost 11 games this year despite having a double digit lead in the 4th quarter, most of those due to LP's rotations. Hes not a good coach my guy.  And yes you lost to the better team. We have a better coach imo, undeniably more depth and talent, the best player on the court (we had less FT's btw too I'm just saying), a better defensive game plan for disrupting your initiator on offense, a better rim protector, better shooting (yes I know the Knicks had a higher 3pt % but we have more guys that can make that shot which opens up the floor more), and we out rebounded the Knicks and had less TO's.   Does this help?"
are you really telling me John Collins over dame?    neither plays a lick of defense. I‚Äôd rather take the guy whose actually been in the playoffs year in and out over collins   or maybe i read it wrong lol
Why go for john collins
"I wonder what deal makes sense for Rubio to the lakers.    I love Ricky.  Ant loves Ricky.  I don‚Äôt want to trade Rubio, but I can add.   And if we‚Äôre trading for John Collins or someone like that, we need Rubio‚Äôs salary to make it work.   The Lakers are a great fit for him."
"Reducing Clint Capela, an elite defender and top 3 rim protector, to only his offense is stupid. Describing John Collins, one of the best off ball bigs in the league, as the dude with the awful dunk contest is stupid. You didnt even touch on our bench? You didnt co textualize the teams that Nate was coaching? Ugh i usually dont get mad about this type of stuff, but what hawks team were you watching bruh"
"I think he‚Äôs talking more about the athletic floor being raised. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs bringing up the average. Jordans and Ervings and Carters have and will always exist as freaks at the top of the athletic range but watching back then the bigs especially were slow, low vertical guys cause they didn‚Äôt have to be athletic. Now every center who gets significant minutes has to be able to move their feet, jump, run the floor, or be incredibly skilled (i.e. jokic). Now we have a laundry list of 6-9 to 6-11 athletes like bam, mpj, John Collins, and jerami grant who fill out rosters instead of the 7-1 bruisers of the past cause they get run off the court much easier."
No he isnt. He‚Äôs not better then John Collins. He only played 43 games this year. It‚Äôs like your ignoring all my points. Who did luka have the first year? Answer the question
Bro so John Collins did play 41 games. Yeah your right. The first year and this year the trae hada better team. So again are not going to talk about comp. also if luka wins the next game their is barely any difference. The west is way harder
"Or a young, Beal, Bogi, Hunter and John Collins lineup. The hawks would be a title contender for sure."
"Yeah luka was the third you idiot. Again kp last year played like 2 games. This year he is not a all star. This year he is on John Collins level. Bro by the way, luka has only had one year where he had the better team. That was last year. Also are we not going to talk about the como or nah?"
"ESPN: TRAE VILLAIN  /r/nba: Trae villain?  John Collins: Understandable, have a great day."
"The Knicks were a paper-thin team in the regular season who thrived because they had a great defensive coach (and defense is one things that EVERY player can do when they try) and they played in the east.   They lost this series because they weren't able to play that same level of defense across the board.   They did a fine job defending Capela and Collins, even Bogdan, but came at the expense of Trae dropped 30+ on them on the road three times.   I don't think it's a 'dreadful' series for Randle: The Hawks didn't have a lot of guys to defend.   Randle is playing in the post.  Who else do the Knicks have there to have to pay attention to?   Their other leading scorers (none of whom are averaging much more than the mid-teens) are all back court/wing guys.   The Hawks can double Randle a lot and get away with it.   I mean... first of all, the Hawks got Clint Capela. That dude is a phenomenal defender.   And he's got John Collins to help out with double, who is no slouch himself.   And it's not like the Hawks don't have other guys to help with doubles. They have a few solid defenders.  I don't see this as a failure at all for Randle. Just a wake up call for the Knicks that they need more offensive players and that they can't get by on defense alone."
I wanted TJ Leaf over John Collins and was mad when the Pacers took him the pick before us.  Thanks Pacers!
Mavs would look so much better if John Collins replaces this struggling Porzingis.
I wanna see you guys get Derozan. And then maybe like John Collins or Richaun Holmes or somehow magically get Mobley LOL.
Pretty sure I saw him at least dap up John Collins
Patrick Williams or John Collins
Myles Turner or John Collins. He needs a reliable big and not some 7'3 shooting guard
"2017 Draft, Knicks get Frank Ntilikina at #8, Hawks get John Collins at #19.   2018 Draft, Knicks get Kevin Knox at #9, Hawks get Kevin Huerter at #19.    :/"
Go after John Collins if ATL doesn‚Äôt want to pay him. Not a super star but the man can pick up what Luka doesn‚Äôt do
You can have John Collins
John Collins
Only if I get John Collins for yours
"Ah yes, one good player. It's not like Clint Capela wasn't an absolutely dominant center this year, John Collins showing that he can play well with Trae, and the multiple young and talented players like Hunter or Huerter. Delete this stupid comment."
"Hawks are really really solid. You have a point god, a euro sniper with good length and clutch who can runs pnr, a prototypical 3&amp;d wing, John collins a 20ppg guy on 50/40 shooting, and a great rim protecting center in Capela. Plus good depth. And their play style is very playoff ready.   With embiid in doubt I'm gonna say Hawks in 6, death by 100 floaters."
"Since the game clock is still going but not the shot clock, I get where he‚Äôs coming from. But wtf are you doing John Collins"
"I think we win in 6 if Joel doesn‚Äôt come back ASAP. Could win in 4 or 5 if he does. I‚Äôm a little wary of Capela and John Collins. Hawks run a huge lineup, and with no Joel, our lineups are actually kinda small."
Clint Capela and John Collins are about to tear Philadelphia apart without Embiid
Noel tried pulling John Collins down by his jersey
How many times John Collins gonna end up on the floor
Someone tell John Collins to fucking relax.
Sounds like John Collins statline game 2. It happens.
Randle: *elbows John Collins in the face *  Idiots: Wtf Trae gets away with that all game üò¢  Edit: Knicks fans. Damn autocorrect smh
John Collins is the tallest ‚Äústand in the wing catch and shoot‚Äù guy in the league.  Thank god he didn‚Äôt get a Max from Atlanta
How often does John Collins hang out with Migos?
"John Collins seems like a cool dude, seems like he smokes a fuck ton of weed"
It hurts how bad I want John Collins on the Spurs. It hurts more knowing there‚Äôs a 0% chance it happens too
Is it me or does John Collins stand around and watch a lot of basketball?
"I think I‚Äôd target one of Serge Ibaka, John Collins, or Richaun Holmes.  Despite his age and recent slide, I think I might take a first crack at Ibaka. I think the Celtics are much too young, and need as much championship-proven talent as they can get. I think a frontcourt with Ibaka and Tristan is pretty good. There‚Äôs championship experience there.  I‚Äôd also try to upgrade at PG. I doubt he‚Äôd come to Boston, but Chris Paul would be a big shakeup. I think he could keep Tatum and Brown well fed.  DeRozan might be my second choice. I want someone who has scoring ability, but also a healthy passing/assist game.  Maybe have Jabari be our first wing off the bench. Smart be the first guard. Robert Williams the first big.  A certain segment of Celtics fandom thinks Williams is the next big thing. I‚Äôm not convinced, but I certainly wouldn‚Äôt complain if he is.   What I fully expect, is that Ainge will run it back with this same group. And I think it would work if Kemba‚Äôs knee hadn‚Äôt turned into a fucking mortar and pestle the moment he landed at Logan.  Frankly, I think we‚Äôd have a better team * right now*, if we had kept IT and Horford around. Kyrie was a mistake that Ainge never should have made. He‚Äôs been trying to make up for it ever since, and that strikes me as a general still fighting his previous battle, rather than preparing for the next.  I don‚Äôt think Ainge sucks, exactly. But I do think, thanks to the Kyrie experiment, that he‚Äôs behind the curve right now, rather than ahead of it.  I also think his almost pathological *need* to ‚Äòfleece‚Äô every potential trade partner has cost him some real opportunities to improve the team.  He‚Äôs not acting like 07/08 Ainge. And that‚Äôs the guy we need right now.  I don‚Äôt know. I think we *could have* beat the Nets if we were at full health. I‚Äôll comfortably pit Tatum and Brown against Durant and Harden. I‚Äôll happily throw a (healthy, admittedly Charlotte-era) Kemba at Kyrie.  But Kemba will never be the guy he was, and that just needs to be addressed.  I think I‚Äôm going in circles now‚Ä¶"
I mean apparently the dude I was responding to doesn‚Äôt know your roster and he‚Äôs a fan of your team. He thinks John Collins is a 7 footer lol
"and never forget: he was hurt, the Rockets didn't want him, and everyone clowned the Hawks because ""how will he fit with John Collins?!"" Christ those takes were endless.  borderline steal of the decade, thanks Rockets"
"define cheap.  His QO is $7M next year, so anything that isn't significantly more than that won't fly because Collins can bet on himself, take the $7M for one year and then hit UFA where the Blazers might lose him for nothing.    If the Blazers do try &amp; work a contract with him this summer then they're throwing good money after bad and hamstringing their flexibility going forward and limiting their options to get the most out of the rest of Dame's prime.     Also nobody needs enforcers in the NBA anymore, especially those that can't finish around the rim, foul way too much and are generally weak on the glass.  Besides, if the Blazers truly do ""need"" an enforcer, that's Nurkic.  Having more than 1 of those on a roster is a bad idea.  The only thing anyone can point to for hope on Zach Collins is an 11 game sample size where he knocked down a solid % of some of the widest open looks an NBA player will get, and even then he was wildly inconsistent night to night and the team basically asked nothing of him.  If you think any of that is somehow better than All-NBA/All-Star level players in Bam/Mitchell or one of the best wing defenders in the NBA (OG) or a walking 20/10 with legit 3-point range (John Collins, who is basically what Zach Collins is supposed to be except he's actually good) then I have some ocean-front property in the Dalles to sell you."
Well John Collins didn‚Äôt make sense from the jump so I assume Zach Collins was now on the Hawks or something since that‚Äôs the only Collins that I could think of taller than Simmons.
"Imo, Horford would be a perfect fit in Atlanta lol. Playing behind Capela, not many folks can give you quality 15 minutes on Giannis and Embid...   John Collins SnT for Horford + name # of 1st round picks?"
"Zach Collins over Bam, Donovan Mitchell, OG Anunoby and John Collins. Woof."
"Mixed up Zach Collins, who is actually bigger than Simmons, with John Collins, who is definitely not bigger than Simmons since JC is only 6‚Äô 9‚Äù."
He has no lift. Easy to block. John Collins will destroy him
"Yeah and the Knicks were a lot better than the Mavs in the 90s and 70s. Nobody gives a fuck you loser lmao. Right NOW you have a generational superstar who still can‚Äôt get any further than a ragtag group of castoffs with the lowest payroll in the league ( the Knicks) because you‚Äôre paying Kristaps Porzingis $30M per year to be your ‚Äúsecond superstar‚Äù when you‚Äôd be better off with an empty roster spot lmaoooooooo. You fucking morons actually thought that was a good idea to trade assets for the right to give him that deal. And because your morons thought that was a good idea, the Knicks had as good a season as the fraudulent Mavs in the midst of a complete rebuild lolol. Tom Thibodeau singlehandedly schemed a bunch of castoffs and children to within 1 win of you bums lmaooo.  Also the Hawks already had Trae Young/John Collins and whoever else last year and then went on a spending spree this offseason so I have no idea what you‚Äôre sorry ass is doing laughing at them. They‚Äôre in much better position than those frauds in Dallas too champ. And deep down you know that and you cope by coming on Reddit and harassing people for absolutely no reason because you‚Äôre a fucking loser LOL."
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it‚Äôs a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line‚Ä¶  Put the ball in Tyler Herro‚Äôs hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‚ÄòGary Harris‚Äô guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it‚Äôs the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He‚Äôs not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‚Äò5 guys who average 15 a game‚Äô blueprint has never worked"
"Kawhi (will opt out to secure a bigger contract), CP3 (maybe he opts out his 1 yr 44mill to secure a 2 yr 50-60 mill), Derozan, Lowry, Conley, John Collins (RFA) , Lonzo Ball (RFA), Richaun Holmes, Jarett Allen (RFA), Norman Powell, Oladipo, Lauri Markannen (RFA), D Rose"
John Collins is a very handsome man
Yeah Butler would be a nice option too  Just have a feeling the Heat will talk themselves into the bubble not being a fluke and try for a star (Lowry or John Collins probably)/run it back  Clippers if they disappoint again would behave with more urgency I feel
"I fear we're going to chase Demar, who we don't need rn IMO. I hope D Rose comes back and we can get another piece.  Boy would I love it if we stole John Collins away."
"John Collins had this to say just before the trade deadline, when a lot of people thought he had a good chance of being traded, ""I want to stay. I want to be true to Atlanta for my entire career... it means something to me. I want to be here. I want my future to be here.""  Source: https://twitter.com/MikeConti929/status/1374528351138906119?s=20  I think there's a very high chance we get a deal done with him, and if not an extremely high chance we match anything he's offered. As you saw in game 2, we are a very different team without him on the court, even though he overlaps with Capela a lot offensively.   As for which teams want him, there are plenty, he's an elite rim runner, probably top 5 in pick and roll, I'd have to look at the stats. He shoots 40% from 3, and has improved at every part of his game since being drafted. He's incredibly athletic, obviously, and will continue to improve. He pairs *perfectly* with Trae, and they have fantastic chemistry. A lot of people are afraid we may pay him too much, but he is the exact big you want to pair with Trae offensively, and he defensively he's been improving, and this series showed that he can continue to be better on that end.  If I had to name a team that will go after him hard, it'd be the spurs most likely imo. Not 100% certain after that."
"At the moment Capela is resting or in foul trouble, the Sixers will licking their chops. They will play John Collins for a small lineup or Onyeka Okongwu as a backup centre, that's going to be the biggest disaster. Embiid going to shit down Capela's throat and foul him out. If Sixers are locked in, Sixers in 4 or 5. The sixers are a much better team, with more playoff experience and probably better coaching."
"No, they can‚Äôt. Most teams top players are used as enforcers. They should be focused on the game.   I was there. The crowd got a loud chant of overrated going, and the literal next play he goes and elbows John Collins in the face for a offensive foul.   He‚Äôs lashing out in the worst way and it shows me he‚Äôs completely let them get in his head. Which is leading to the worst playoff performance I‚Äôve seen since Lillard vs Holiday"
"&gt;Randle is more talented but he can be a black hole offensively which Collins never is  Had me in the first half not gonna lie. John Collins is younger and has a much brighter future than Randle. Maybe on a perfect night in the regular season he's better than Collins. But ""more talented"" ? Step too far."
"I‚Äôm not saying trae and bogi are better than westbrook and Beal overall, but there is no way the hawks are better with westbrook and Beal. This team was built around trae, with three point shooters all around plus two big lob threats and who also flourish in the paint. Russ and capela doesn‚Äôt work very well, and especially not Russ, capela, and John Collins."
"So if trae young goes off and Atl somehow wins a ring this year, does John Collins not deserve it?"
john collins is the third best player to ever play in the league behind michael jordan and kobe bryant
"Literally not even close, John Collins is like Lauri Markkanen 2.0"
'No sir you are mistaken - John Collins is my best friend'  Fuck that got me
"Extensive pressure on Randle seems to be the difference maker. In addition‚Ä¶ he just seems exceptionally deconditioned? Obviously not the reason the hawks are winning, let‚Äôs be clear, the hawks are the more talented team. John Collins was bound to wake up sooner than later and Bogdonovic is nasty when his shot lines up. Not sure if having Robinson can free up defenders in the paint to suppress the three point shooting by the Hawks. Wish we had him back next game to find out. Anyway, my two cents."
"Trae Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, John Collins, and Kevin Huerter had never played in the playoffs before this season either."
I hope Randle‚Äôs kid enjoyed giving him the MIP trophy because his grandfather John Collins has been dicking down his father
"*punches John Collins in the nose* ""Playoff basketball babyyyy"""
" I just want to point out Randle is in absolute hell right now. Deandre Hunter and John Collins have literally dropped their ball sack on this dudes forehead in the most important games of his life so far. Mentally, physically, and psychologically this guy is resembling a fucking giraffe out on the court right now. Dude is passing up open 3‚Äôs, missing layups, getting absolutely fucked up on both sides of the court. Hope the Knicks enjoy their first class flight right back to the fucking projects after this series is over."
"Fr fr. And calling Collins ""John"" just sounds incredibly weird. They're not your friends, Burke"
"Randle has been so dirty all series. Straight up punched Bogi in the face, gave John Collins the Metta World Peace, and now this"
If the refs don't call all those fouls on John Collins don't forget that.
John Collins in the Hawks locker room getting stiches so that‚Äôs good
the most productive thing randle did in the series is injure john collins
Commentator: looks like John Collins has a bloody nose  Me: show us how.
I want more from John Collins too

Today is a John collins day. Fall back trae. No more long distance shots.
If you were starting a team today it would be better to build around John Collins than Julius Randle.
Bro John Collins just went on a fucking shooting spree. Apparently they don‚Äôt have an answer for him either
i love john collins
John the Baptist Collins
Man if John Collins had a handle he would be a perennial all star
Definitely rooting against him at the moment but can‚Äôt lie John Collins seems like a good dude
John Collins is who is gonna make the difference in this series
I just want John Collins to christen someone with a dunk.
Randle should be taking John Collins‚Äô narrow ass to the paint every single time
Has John Collins done anything this series?
John Collins destroying his paycheck this summer game by game.
"He's talking about the store owner, but yeah fuck John Collins ig"
"&gt;    I'd want to throw in Josh Richardson if he opts in too.    I think KP can succeed but he's just not a fit here. Maybe going to OKC with less expectations will help out but it's pretty obvious he isn't happy here.   Horford is $4MM cheaper next season and $7MM cheaper in 22-23, trading away JRich saves up another $10MM this year in addition to our current Max spot opening, which would allow us to go after Richuan Holmes/John Collins and re-sign THJ/ Brunson in 2022."
"None of the other defenders the hawks have including John collins who is on Simmons a lot, actually is that impactful on embiid. Trae and bogi are too small to help, collins isn‚Äôt strong enough to compete with embiid, Huerter has gotten a couple of steals and a block as a help defender but can‚Äôt do much else in terms of stopping him from scoring on all the other possessions.   Hunter is big and strong enough and could have possible helped but he‚Äôs out for the rest of the playoffs."
When Hunter is healthy John Collins is our worst starter. I‚Äôd say him
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
Pre-ACL tear he averaged 9.6 points and played great defense  John Collins averaged 21/10 that season
I think he was picked in the right spot  Tatum and John Collins 100% go ahead of him. Fox too depending on what you value
"atlanta; john collins will need a new contract this year; tre young extension (rose rule) next year. kevin huerter as well. add to that gallo, capela, bogdonovic already on roster, 2022-23 they will be luxury tax."
"If the mavs manage to get John Collins and Richuan Holmes in free agency, trading Porzingis for a veteran PG (who's on a shorter deal) doesn't look insane"
"because Simmons is just standing flat-footed out of bounds, John Collins (Simmons' defender) is able to stay in help position to cut off a drive and empowers Huerter to aggressively dig down on Embiid and then cut off the passing lane to the paint when Thybulle cuts to the middle.  Embiid has to take the J, which he makes because he's awesome, but it'd be even easier for him if the floor was spread."
"Genuine question, how do you guys feel about John Collins?  Is this just a match up problem? I'm not seeing anything from him."
[John Collins with 6 fouls. 8 points in 35min. I don‚Äôt even have anything against him but I cannot believe Hawks fans were tweeting us his lowlights against Mike Muscala lmfao ](https://twitter.com/dmay706/status/1402449431648247808?s=21)
"There's no way John Collins is getting a max right? Actually he would look pretty good next to Luka, not sure how the contract would work though."
"John Collins ain‚Äôt bad, he‚Äôs just up against the second best big. But he‚Äôs insane if he thinks he‚Äôs getting close to the max."
What happened to John Collins?
"The Hawks should give this core another year.    I think they need a defensive power forward.  They should look to move Danillo Gallinari for a defense-first player in my opinion.  They can give the keys to Kevin Huerter to be the number one option off the bench.  Perhaps Serge Ibaka?  Dorian Finney-Smith?  John Collins' value looks a bit low, so they should probably hold and look to do something next offseason via a sign-and-trade."
John Collins straight trash
John Collins you going to hell before you getting a max contract
You think Embiid going to the free throw line is uncommon? John Collins had an outlier good game last game. Boggie and Gallo were also hot.    It's more likely Seth and Green end up going off next game
John Collins is looking horrible out there atm. Bascially lost the game on his own
What is John Collins good at?
John Collins is looking horrible out there
John Collins is looking horrible out there
john collins is a walmart porzingis like how trae young is a walmart luka doncic
Lou Williams and John Collins really sold today.
John Collins just isn't it
john collins sucks
John Collins should be ejected for pulling Danilo Gallinari into Sixers legend all-time MVP snub Joel the process Embiid with such violent force
John Collins and Clint Capela don't exist?
John Collins was literally pulling Gallo off the floor and Embiid is walking without paying attention. They did actually watch the replay right? WTF.
"Wolves should be up there.  He‚Äôs friends with Towns, the Wolves need a PF, and Towns will bang down low so Porzingis doesn‚Äôt have to.    My money is on the Wolves getting John Collins, but I could see this happen."
"John Collins was so cool and collected during that whole exchange. Just smiling at Embiid, like ‚Äúdude let‚Äôs just calm down!‚Äù"
"John Collins was so cool and collected during that whole exchange. Just smiling at Embiid, like ‚Äúdude let‚Äôs just calm down!‚Äù"
John Collins just cheesing it up
Embiid gets the foul cuz John Collins is ass lol
Really put John Collins in a tough situation there
Philadelphia slowed down on their shot making and allowed us some breathing room to figure out some good looks. Gallo in particular has been doing well. Haven‚Äôt seen John Collins on the floor. Anyone know where he is? /s
john collins wants a max contract and dude can‚Äôt even get a bucket without trae passing to him lmao
John Collins looking soft
"You can attach excuses to every move, some things just don't work out, sure. But when EVERY recent pick and offseason move hasn't moved the needle, it's a problem. It doesn't matter what the reasoning at the time was.    Whether it's luck or competence, other teams have been able to find late round contributors like Quickly, OG, Allen,  John Collins, or Huerter. They've been able to scout and draft future all stars outside the top 10 like Bam, Mitchell, SGA, or MPJ. The Blazers meanwhile have whiffed year after year.    The results speak for themselves. Dame is incredible and the roster isn't. Powell is great but he easily could walk. Covington is a solid player but the value was too high. What even is Olshey's best recent move?"
He's going to ignore the issue Collins had with Trae earlier in the season.  https://theathletic.com/2307304/2021/01/08/atlanta-hawks-john-collins-trae-young/
Tony Snell over John Collins
John Collins already looks like he announces games.  Think of how many administrative assistants he‚Äôs gonna knock up from 2036-2044 once he gets his turtleneck game on point.
"A user on the Warriors subreddit typed out a list of all the crazy shit he did when he was with the Warriors, I wish I could give them credit but they deleted their account.  ‚Ä¢Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  ‚Ä¢Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  ‚Ä¢Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  ‚Ä¢Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  ‚Ä¢Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  ‚Ä¢Ran ISO-ball all the time  ‚Ä¢Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy  ‚Ä¢Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy s*** he said to the team  ‚Ä¢Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  ‚Ä¢Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  ‚Ä¢Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy s*** like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  ‚Ä¢Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts  ‚Ä¢Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  ‚Ä¢All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  ‚Ä¢He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're s***, go take his job""  ‚Ä¢Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc)  ‚Ä¢No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes"
My question is with Bridges what are the chances he bets on himself similiarto John Collins in hope for a max and doesnt take the extension  if it isnt the max. Not saying he deserves the max but I feel there would be some teams next year that would offer him a max just off his progression and potential
"Well nothing has really been proven, so maybe it sounds overly paranoid, but the ironic thing is that John Collins and DeAndre Ayton have already been popped for PEDs, and their teams are having strong postseason runs. What are the odds that they are the only two dudes in the league using?  I think people would rather just enjoy the ride than think about it. There was a lot of celebration of Lance Armstrong, Mark McGwire, Marion Jones, Barry Bonds, etc. before more of the dirt came out about them. It ruins the fun to some extent. People just want to enjoy the stories."
"He‚Äôs used terribly in their offense and he also just plays too passively. Also doesn‚Äôt help that his defense sucks now. If he is used more like a better shooting John Collins or Christian Wood, he could be elite again, but right now he‚Äôs basically 7‚Äô3 PJ Tucker who can‚Äôt defend"
"I disagree fully.  KP and THJ get along well.  I see KP hanging out with and dapping most of the other teammates.  KP and Luka fell apart sometime between the bubble and this season and I don't know why.  John Collins and Trae had a similar falling out earlier this season but they worked it out. I feel both KP and Luka are better than their counterparts on that duo, so I'm really hopeful they can hash out whatever the problem is this summer.  They're too damn good to let youthful immaturity blow this up."
My current best casual fan doesn‚Äôt give a fuck/know a fuck roster:  PG: Jamal Murray   SG: Norman Powell  SF: khris Middleton  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre ayton
Lol yeah idk about that one. I liked John Collins cuz he went to wake forest and I'm from Winston salem but i genuinely thought he'd be good too
Lol no. Unless we gonna say John Collins/Bogdanovic/Capela is better than Middleton/Jrue/Lopez
Is Bogdan better than John Collins?
He had the two best passes of the game with this pass to bog and the full court pass to John Collins at the end of the game. Philly was just trapping everything.
"Tons of people missed on John Collins, my team included.  Fuck TJ Leaf"
"To lighten up your draft misery, the bucks picked DJ Wilson 2 spots before John Collins. That still hurts me in my soul."
KLove and LMA made the list over John Collins.
"if shelling out huge contracts for Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard won't do it, or drafting Zach Collins over Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White won't do it, this asinine shit is fine.  How does this MFer still have a job?"
John Collins or Bogi
"idk why you‚Äôre turning this into such a thing, or why you‚Äôre getting so amped up about it. I haven‚Äôt edited a comment and made a point purposely with a qualifier because it is impossible to project people any other way.   also every team‚Äôs success is due to their roster absent maybe like the Heatles just winning based on their big 3, and even then guys like Ray Allen and others played roles. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs lots of people who think Bogdanovic, Capela, John Collins,  and others are all good players. Those 3 guys are probably more useful than a single player on the Mavs (maybe not THJ)."
John Collins to the Mavs for Porzingis. Luka throws oops to Collins and Trae and The Unicorn kill it from three.
John Collins time
I guess John Collins is a bad screener too since he‚Äôs skinny
I like Brunson. He should be solid going forward. Luka is going to play 36 a game or so and dominate the ball when he does (rightfully so). I think the issue is KP. If he's your #2 / co-star you're going to be weak. I think it's a testament to Luka that they won as many games as they did. Similar to early Lebron years. Get the man some help! Unfortunately Luka couldn't death blow the clips and steal Kawhi from them as a reward. John Collins would be solid but I don't think Atlanta is going to let him walk. 32 million off the books in Reddick and Hardaway Jr. Kind of a weak year for free agency but I'm hoping they grab Lowry on a one or two year deal.  I would cut ties with KP if they can move him. Shitty attitude is infectious.
I thought Trae would throw all his lobs to Capela after seeing him in Houston. I guess I forgot John Collins can fuck\*ng fly
All I'll say is that all season Trae has been accused of doing to John Collins exactly what is happening to Porzingis right now
"Lou Will is absolute ass and literally any Hawks fan watching the playoffs will tell you this outside of that one quarter vs the Knicks.  John ""legitimate second option"" Collins averaged a whopping 12 and 6 vs the Knicks shoulda been an all-star honestly unfair for everyone else  Man the starting lineup they pulled out today.... DAMN. How the fuck did the 76ers even keep it close with Solomon Hill in the starting lineup.    Luka off the court mavs have a net rating of 0.3  Trae off the court hawks net rating is -1.8  Luka on the court Mavs net is 3.3  Trae on for the Hawks is 5.2"
"Consider that Luka's second option is Kristaps Porzingis and you will see why I consider John Collins a second option  Fair enough though, I felt it was sort of hard to pick a true second option for Trae considering the fact that the whole team around him is just assembled well"
"John Collins really isn't a second option. He can't create his own shot or take defenders off the dribble. Yeah he looks great finishing lobs and he's developed a serviceable 3-point shot, but his regular season numbers don't tell the whole story. Hunter is a much more important player as long as Capela is there to serve as a lob theat, though Bogi is easily the second-most important player on the team."
"Hawks roster is immensely better, it's not even close. Trae actually has a legitimate second option in John Collins, a great core with Hunter/Capela/Bogdan/Huerter, and good vet depth in Lou Will/Gallinari."
"&gt; Hell, John Collins can even shout 3s!  Can Confirm"
Mavs better throw their cap space at John Collins and Lonzo this off-season and hope they sign. This roster sucks so much
"Genuine question: as a PLAYOFF player, especially as a second scoring option on a team, would you rather have John Collins or Ben Simmons? For me it's Collins all day. Hawks need to pay that man."
yeah its really hard to stay in front of elite ball handler danny green. Definitely John Collins fault.
"Richuan Holmes. John Collins. Lonzo Ball. Doug McDermott.       Probably lose THJ to free agency, but would love to have him back.      Trade Zingis for... Wiggins?"
"Sure mavs got the better player, but its hard to say the hawks lost at this point, trae is a great fit with john collins"
"KP is trash and Hardaway is inconsistent. Not equivalent to John Collins, Capela, Hunter, Bogey, and a deep bench"
Any chance the mavs make a run at John Collins this offseason?
"Hopefully john collins still wants out of Atlanta, sign and trade Porzingis"
"Last year, I was told on /r/nba that KP was better than John Collins. Alright it was one Mavs fan but still pretty crazy right?"
"at least john collins is good, KP just a black hole"
give Luka John Collins and the mavs win in 5 or 6
Holy shit John Collins
John Collins with that Smolk
"I cant describe enough my love for John Collins. He is so fucking Atlanta. I want him to retire here. If we dont resign him, I will cry."
"""John Collins is your Finals MVP"""
That ending was horrifyingly close. I love Atlanta hawks basketball. I love Trae Young. I love John Collins. I love Bogi Bogdanovic. I love Clint Capela. I love Kevin Hurter.
"Danilo Galinari, Bogi, and John Collins are not role players lmao"
"Holy shit, he got up for that. And it‚Äôs on Embid lmao. Stone Cold John Collins coming for you"

[Exclusive photo of John Collins christening Embiid](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyF2iV5XAAIx6jl?format=jpg&amp;name=large)
John Collins just assraped all of Philly like it was a retirement home
Trae Young and John Collins are SICKüò≠
JOHN COLLINS!! That dunk was fucking incredible.
John Collins really beat up that invisible ninja who attacked him after the alley oop
John Collins is that dude
Whoever giving John Collins a max contract gonna be fighting their demons for years
Jesus Christ John Collins
Hawks fans can I offer you one Porzingis for John Collins
John Collins with the fuck you alley-oop.
John Collins without scoring
Bro John Collins does not play like Draymond Green at all.
"All good. Hopefully yall on the right track now with a fresh start from a FO perspective.  Just hoping yall find a young star to pair with Luka like Trae with John Collins cuz KP aint it, man's just doing cardio."
I'm less cranky about the Pacers letting McMillan move on than I am about them leaving John Collins on the board to [draft TJ Leaf](https://www.indycornrows.com/2020/11/24/21612580/what-lessons-can-the-pacers-learn-from-t-j-leaf-nba).   (And don't even mention OG Anunoby where Pacers fans gather.)
"Lol he thinks Gallo is going to somehow recover and outjump him‚Ä¶ he then mumbled something about how Collins was dropping down to cover. I rewatched it, John Collins is basically standing on the free throw line as Simmons two foot gathers‚Ä¶."
John Collins deserves a max solely for having the balls to wear that shirt to the post game conference.
Holy shit I didn't even realize that! Thought it was John Collins or someone else LMFAOOOO
To clear up money for next year to re-sign John Collins. This was reported by multiple hawks reporters all through the year.  Even the kings reporters said this.  https://www.sactownroyalty.com/2021/4/30/22412679/sacramento-kings-news-bogdan-bogdanovic-sign-and-trade-tony-snell-atlanta-hawks
John Collins will need to drop a quintuple double for me to accept that second point
"Lmao it's all good, every team does it. I was just a lil dramatic because that moment was so huge.like u said it won them the game pretty much. Let me tell you , when he hit the huge 3 near the end of game 7.. it was so sick. He's an insanely underrated player. Just like booker imo. People finally get to see how good they are. They both are getting their chance to shine in the playoffs.its been amazing too watch. My favorite player on the hawks is John Collins. I swear he has springs in his shoes. He's such a good player and duo with Trae."
"Damn, John Collins gives no fucks about sports jinxes! Hawks better Max him this summer! He‚Äôs bout that life‚Ä¶"
"Hawks team is literally alternate timeline bucks. Giannis pick, DJ Wilson over John collins, Donte over heurter, Bogi"
Two big storylines I think everyone is missing are:      1. Tony Snell facing the franchise he once carried on his back      2. A final way to settle if the bucks should have taken John Collins over DJ Wilson in the draft. This is an all timer imo and will probably never be settled.
I see John Collins shops at the same place Terry Rozier does
Trae Young  (It would've been either him or Luka since the Hawks wanted a PG.)  Kevin Hueter (19th pick)  DeAndre Hunter (Needed perimeter defense. Best perimeter defender in the class.)  John Collins (Also 19th pick)  Onyeka Okongwu (Needed a backup center. High upside.)
Lol what. Collins dunk was absolutely filthy but thinking john collins was in embiids head is fucking hilarious lol
They deliberately didn't show any angle on TV of John Collins arm around embiid head
"This is what blows my fuckin mind.   ‚ÄúFlagrants don‚Äôt have to be intentional, just accidental contact to the head, except when it‚Äôs John Collins knee on Seth Curry‚Äôs fucking face‚Äù"
John Collins is now officially an Atlanta historical site
I think you‚Äôre massively overrating the Mavs supporting cast. John Collins would easily be the Mavs second best player and Capela may even be the 3rd.
"Yeah, because John Collins is better than Joel Embiid /s"
John Collins is now a certified Atlanta historical site
John Collins
"Thank Shlenk for that as well. This roster is so well constructed; my favorite thing about this rebuild is the clear vision our organization has carried.  We get Trae and John Collins to build around; together, they are a well rounded pair that can collectively shoot from deep, play in the post, and run an offense. Then you grab a traditional center in Clint Capela, who can anchor your defense and get rebounds. Drafting well in Deandre Hunter and Reddiish, while Okongwu is proving to be developing nicely. Finally we have shooters off the bench in Bogdanovic, Gallo, and Huerter.  If Trae can't get 30, he can just get assists. If he is having trouble in that, we have other ball-handlers to help out. It's weird being happy with an Atlanta FO, but the Hawks have been doing great in that regard."
John Collins is about to get a bag
John Collins. Big postseason run = getting paid by someone. Even tho it‚Äôs not really him doing it.
Dinwiddie could get some money thrown at him. John Collins if he keeps playing good.
That‚Äôd be cool if John Collins wasnt a role player getting carried by Trae and Kevin Huerter
"First Trae pisses off New York, then John Collins does this to Philly.  You gotta respect the Hawks lmao"
loooooooool hadn't seen that John Collins shirt
"Oh shit, John Collins actually put that boy on a t-shirt  And they did Capella wrong with that screenshot lol"
Lol the funny thing is I've always been a trae fan and even me being a trae fan it made sense that he didn't make the all star team was underperforming and he went through that weird slump when the john Collins rumors came out
eh seems like reasonable karma for trying to tackle John Collins and not even getting a flagrant for it
Hope you max John Collins and keep the core forever!
"It's was so funny Sixers fans convincing themselves Simmons's lack of shooting isn't a problem in the playoffs. Meanwhile, I watch him dribble ball up and John Collins is 15 feet off him making an Embiid sandwich with Capella."
"Assuming Curry joins, it'll be Curry/Dray/Durant again, and Beal/Lillard/Booker can easily fill in for Klay's spot offensively.  With Green at the 5, and Durant/Tatum at 3/4 and Booker at the 2, that's a scary team. Lillard/Beal would feast on any second unit out there (and probably most of the first units also).  Team USA just needs Adebayo to commit to seal the deal (Jokic, Gobert, Embiid, Ayton are on other national teams). Or maybe John Collins?"
"The apologies best be loud as the disrespect. Yall never gave us a chance coming into these playoffs, coming into the Knicks series, coming into the Ph*lly series, and now going into this Bucks series. Hawks heard yall talking ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö   Kevin Huerter played in the biggest game in his career and fucking delivered. John Collins took 3 charges and was an animal tonight. Gallinari and Lou Will stepped up on Defense!?!? OO punked the 76ers for 15 minutes. I'm so fuxking happy rn"
I know most of the attention is on Huerter but John Collins had a really great game for the Hawks too. Took some key charges and fought for rebounds all game. Very tough for them to win this one without his play imo
Ben Simmons' middle name is John Collins
John Collins got the entire Atlanta Hawks organization talking to him after that possession lol
john collins ain‚Äôt worth the money
John Collins is too nice for the NBA.
What a fucking game for John Collins.
"Ben simmons and John Collins should kiss, am I right ladies?"
Ben talking shit to John Collins after scoring 4 points in an elimination game is incredibly funny to me
You‚Äôre an idiot lol.   Trae is the best player on the court in the series. Much different than John Collins
John Collins is there too. Better than Zion??? Must be. His team is in the EASTERN CONFERENCE SEMI FINALS AFTER BEATING THE POWERHOUSE KNICKS AFTER ALL
I just want to see John Collins put Simmons in a headlock.
John Collins not giving up his max without a fight.
And I still hate John Collins
i do NOT like john collins.
Atlanta gives John Collins NOTHING. Let him touch the fucking ball you idiots
Lol John Collins is a punk
John Collins is always so happy when he causes mischief
I like John collins
What a game by John Collins
John Collins is a god tier agitator
"Him and John Collins switched roles for this series, it's been bizarre"
John ‚ÄúRollin‚Äù Collins
Why does John Collins always looks like he‚Äôs high?
John Collins flagrant drawer
But John Collins literally choke slammed someone with a defensive foul lol
I can‚Äôt watch this game with a open heart knowing that we picked TJ Leaf over John Collins
John Collins has knees like 4 people in the face this series MINIMUM
Oh cmon.  JOHN COLLINS KICKED SETH CURRY‚ÄôS FACE
John Collins is the definition of soft
John Collins is so damn tough
John Collins tried to knockout Curry - fine  Dwight swipes for the ball - flagrant 5
John Collins getting beat up on the court
John Collins draws a lot of flagrants lol. At some point it‚Äôs not a coincidence
John Collins gave Curry a flying knee to the face but they‚Äôre reviewing that?
John Collins tends to touch the refs a lot
Lmao john collins talking about a max when really it should be hunter
John Collins used High jump kick
I have more muscular legs than John Collins. At least I got that going for me....
John Collins from da hood!
i would assume you would be on the ground if john collins tackled you
John Collins has both kneed Curry in the head and tried to run through Joel Embiid and yet we are the dirty team according to /r/nba
John Collins playing extremely wreckless tonight
John Collins the mediator
John Collins always trying to peace make for Trae lol
Please tell me how he is but John Collins isn‚Äôt?
People have the nerve to call Embiid a bitch but not John Collins are you kidding me
John Collins fucking shinsuke nakamura‚Äôd Seth curry
Damn John Collins hit curry with the v trigger
John ‚ÄòSoldier of God‚Äô Collins
2nd time John Collins has tried to kill Seth in the last 2 gamez
"If you wanna talk Travels; John Collins took a step, hop stepped, then took 2 more steps lol"
John Collins will be a big time player in his career
The handsomeness of John Collins outweighs everything else
"You‚Äôre excusing John Collins kicking someone, I‚Äôm excusing Joel Embiid walking into someone."
lonzo ball and john collins - restricted free agents (young players)
"The article literally says    &gt;The NBA fined Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid $35,000 on Sunday for his on-court altercation with Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of their second-round playoff series Friday."
Loooool he told me that too when I brought up Embiid diving into John Collins knees. Fuckin bozo ü§°ü§°ü§°
"i think the knicks are low-key gonna go after john collins for a near max deal. and then go after lonzo ball and offer him the same type of deal they gave to randle a couple years back. also, resign bullock.  c - collins/mitch/pelle   pf - randle/obi   sf - bullock/knox   sg - rj/quickley   pg - lonzo/vildoza    and then use their two first and two seconds to fill out the roster."
You mean like if Embiid pushes John Collins into the stands it's a double technical?
"If the playoffs have proved anything so far, is that it‚Äôs become incredibly apparent how fragile Hawks fans are. Trae Young and John Collins haven‚Äôt committed a foul the whole series if you ask them"
"Kelly Oubre, Nick Young, John Collins"
"He defends Tobias if the Sixers win, John Collins if the Hawks win."
Seriously a team with embiid on it talking about trae.embiid is a professional flopper and the thing is he doesn‚Äôt even need the slightest contact he doesn‚Äôt need any contact. Also trae wasn‚Äôt the one trying to take out John Collins and he also wasn‚Äôt the one elbowing people in the head then pushing him out of bounds because trae wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that like embiid without getting ejected which honestly embiid should‚Äôve been
"Anyone who thinks Hawks will let John Collins walk, doesn't know anything about sports. When a team makes it this far into the playoffs, and there's contract negotiations going on, something will be worked out."
"John Collins can play, no doubt about it. I think OP‚Äôs point was that neither team really has any ‚Äúbig‚Äù names. Porzingis would be the biggest name from these rosters but he‚Äôs clearly not the same player he was in the past."
Not handcuffing themselves? Sign and trade to a team that over values a pretty good ‚Äòyoung‚Äô player?   Would you want John Collins to be the Hawks second best player for Trae‚Äôs career? Maybe I‚Äôm greedy but I would like to see Trae with a 1b.

He legit called a team meeting to say he wasn‚Äôt happy with how Trae was running the offense. This came on the heels of reports they didn‚Äôt exactly get along.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense  https://theathletic.com/2307304/2021/01/08/atlanta-hawks-john-collins-trae-young/  This isn‚Äôt news and was a big deal last season. Nephews in here are so clearly bandwagoners that haven‚Äôt followed the team at all.
"exactly, imagine if this is okc all over again and john collins is harden in this scenario."
If I was John Collins there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm looking to take a paycut when this is the first big contract I could get
&gt; Trae Young is John Collins best friend  So were Shaq and Kobe. Lebron and Kyrie.
"Trae Young is John Collins best friend  Your bad, you only read /r/nba"
I would love to have Collins back. I just don't think he is a max player. The only max player on our team is Trae. Maybe after this run John won't be money hunting and take a 4/110 (20 million increase from what we offered last season).
"John Collins is awesome, how can you not like that guy? He‚Äôs a big time player too"
"Lmao  John Collins is a millionaire with the best doctors in the world, but he doesn‚Äôt cycle off when he knows a test is coming. Makes sense!"
I wasn't comparing the whole roster of both teams. I was just confused that OP's Top 5 players between Hawks and Mavs seem to not include John Collins.
Why didn‚Äôt John Collins know it was coming?
"Should probably ride this out to restricted free agency. Trading him now would be an unforced error. He's not worth max money, but he is really good and he might change the conversation this year. Look what happened with John Collins."
I thought John Collins was gay.. Or was that someone else?  Edit: fuck me. Jason Collins
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever get there unless he puts on like 30 pounds. Collins has been terrible at and against 5s his whole career. Luckily Nate realized that and hasn‚Äôt been buying into the John Collins stretch 5 pipe dream.
I said he guarded Randle once he proved he can't make a perimeter shot.  Way to comprehend what I typed.  LOL.  And sorry this Collins deal onlygets magnified with their run.  They can't max two players and pay Huerter and pay Hunter what he will be projected.  Hunter will be valued in the playoffs more than John.  Sorry you can't see that.  You dont understand the cap enough for this conversation.  We aren't talking fixed salaries.  All these salaries are a % of the cap.  It goes up as the cap does.  LMAO
"I dont see it. I think we have enough guards for the future. We have Trent we gotta re-sign, Fred, maybe Lowry, and possibly Green or Suggs.  I could see us going after Jarrett Allen or John Collins tho."
If they lose John Collins that will be a huge loss. If they keep him they won‚Äôt have much space to work with. But they do have young pieces
"John Collins was drafted 19th, Jeff."
John Collins and Ayton is a bad comparison lmao
&gt; Compare this roster to the Mavericks. Tim Hardaway Jr is pretty soundly the 3rd best player between the two teams. You can‚Äôt convince me Porziginis isn‚Äôt at least comparable (and probably better) to Capela despite his bad series.  Does John Collins simply not exist or something?
I think John Collins and Capela &gt; Porzingis and Hardaway
"I get you can't leave Lopez out there because Trae can cook him. But if you're the Bucks you don't want Giannis to have to compete with John Collins, who got 5 offensive boards last night, and the best rebounder in the NBA in Clint Capela for boards all night. Giannis is going to get worn down if he has to carry too much of the load offensively and defensively.  I don't know the Bucks roster, but it just isn't as simple as taking Lopez out of the starting lineup. That's all I'm trying to say."
John Collins is my best friend
"Well‚Ä¶. Now I‚Äôm a John Collins fan‚Ä¶ great kid, great attitude. That‚Äôs what champions sound like‚Ä¶"
John Collins was pick 19
"Eh, there was a lot of skepticism about whether or not Trae could hold up in the playoffs, and whether or not he would be hunted in the PnR. Also, I don‚Äôt think anyone saw the jump Hunter made coming, or John Collins improving so much on defense and generally blending with Capela.  The questions were legitimate, and I understood why people said they thought we were a play-in team (I actually thought we could be a 4-5 seed), but I don‚Äôt think anyone expected this (I personally thought we could make a hard-fought second round exit at the beginning of the season)."
John Collins is not the 2nd best player on the team. Deandre Hunter is.
"Don‚Äôt think he hates him.  He‚Äôs cut from that old school mindset of earning your keep and is a tough love kinda guy.   The problem was he never took responsibility for losses, didn‚Äôt take input from players, and was super stubborn.   He called John Collins selfish for asking to be included in the offense and ran zero plays for him."
Thanks haha.  We as Hawks fans said we might become insufferable if we won a playoff series.  This is to be expected a little bit.  Especially after Trae just dropped 48 like he was in the All-Star game doing the Shimmy and back board alley-oops to John Collins.
"Imagine if Luka had John Collins, Capela, and Bogdan instead of Tingus Pingus, Dwight Powell, and Josh Richardson"
Clint Capela  John Collins  Gallo   Bog  Heurter  Lou Williams  Trae  Lebron‚Äôs 2007 team was a junior high school squad compared to this Atlanta team.
Don‚Äôt think he deserves to be above anyone on this list but we got John Collins at 19 which is really good value and was a steal
John Collins dunk on Embiid. Shit was beautiful
"When the ball arrives from Trae, it‚Äôs usually scored shortly thereafter.  Almost all of his assists are legitimate creation, not ‚Äúletting John Collins work‚Äù"
John Collins is the man
"Woof, that's about to be one of the worst contracts. I'd rather have DeAndre Hunter as my PF of the right now than John Collins. If Collins could actually play the 5 I could see it but pure 4's I think are very much overrated."
That's literally one of their calling cards. Seth Curry didn't get torched by accident. The Hawks will actively find Gallo so he can post up and shoot (fadeaway) jumpers all day over much shorter guys. Same for John Collins.
"He's a lot more mobile than those 3 guys, but also a fair bit smaller. More of a Dario Saric/John Collins sized than Vuc sized. He is a good post player but can face-up as well. Pretty good passer. Has a jumper but the mechanics seem a little inconsistent at this point - I think he will be a threat from deep though.  I've seen other people claim he will be a bad defender, but I'm not so sure based on what I've seen, he has quick feet for his size and a knack for recovering. Don't think he will be a Bam type defender on the perimeter, but I think he will be a lot better on the perimeter than the 3 guys you listed.  Reminds me of a smaller, less physically gifted Embiid. I think he'll be a borderline starter, and will struggle with bigger matchups but will always have a role because of his shooting and IQ.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcGs9Ts8q_M  This is a good video for film compilation of him (i.e. not just highlights)"
"Why? They don‚Äôt even have Ice Trae on their team? Or his best friend, John Collins"
I like the 2nd vid bc you can see John Collins start to smile after he slams it lol
I‚Äôd say John Collins is their 2nd best player but I didn‚Äôt watch a ton of Hunter on the Hawks. If he‚Äôs better than Collins that‚Äôs scary cuz he‚Äôs damn good.
John Collins gets about 18 per game?
John Collins?
John Collins is clearly your number 2 option.
"Good call, during the Inside The NBA interview John Collins said they did it once in preseason and once against the Nets."
John Collins would be the best non Luka player on our team easily
"It‚Äôs absolutely because of the shirt. No respect at all. The play was an offensive foul as he had Embiid in a headlock. I‚Äôm strictly talking about John Collins here. Sixers absolutely choked, Trae Young has been fantastic and Nate Mcmillian seriously outclassed Doc at every turn."
"Quite the contrary, John Collins is my best friend!"
love John Collins' game man.
"That‚Äôs such a terrible example  How does Kemba play? Attacks the basket relentlessly. Shoots better now, but you don‚Äôt know him for that. And is usually a chair on defense.  John Collins is one of the perfect pick and roll players for young. He can roll to the basket or hit the jumper if needed. Besides that, can stretch the defense with his ability to hit 3s.  If he was a better rebounder, you could play small ball with him at center.  Would I want to pay him a max? No. But the chemistry and mostly hot streak since firing the Lloyd Pierce (pretty sure) and installing Nate as the head coach.  You can‚Äôt lose John Collins for nothing"
"John Collins didn‚Äôt have to say it, but we all knew he thinking ‚Äúwhat a Save! What a save! What a safe! ‚Ä¶.chat has been paused for 4 seconds‚Äù"

"Deandre hunter is the 2nd star. He averaged 18 a game until he got injured and briefly looked like the hawks best player early in the season. He has a great midrange game, can create his own shot, and plays great defense. If you watch some of the knicks series he played in he wasn‚Äôt 100% but he showed it all. Cam/John are going to be #3. Maybe even Huerter. John Collins is only 23 and Cam is 21."
John Collins: you just answered you question fam
John Collins was this good the ENTIRE SEASON. A lot of people didnt see him during the regular season but hes been playing well and consistently this whole time
John Collins sees the shoulder wag:  **backs away**
Maybe not the best choice of words regarding John  https://www.nba.com/news/hawks-john-collins-suspended-25-games-ap?amp=1
"I've been salivating over John Collins all season. After this playoff run, I would hate if this Hawks team had to break up, but I would *love* JC on the Spurs. He's been balling out."
John Collins is my best friend
"He looks good sometimes when I'm watching him. Not in the same universe as Luka or Trae (or Ayton, who's been fantastic in these playoffs). But if he could ever get healthy, big if, I could see him as a reliable 20 a game scorer.  The problem is that he's at that weird 4 spot that most teams won't play big men at these days. It's why I don't like John Collins. He's a really good player, but he's a big man who can't play the 5 and can't defend. But it doesn't mean Bagley can't turn himself into a good player. Randle stars as a 4, Siakam is a good 4. It's possible. But obviously he just needs to get healthy in the worst way."
"I get what you're saying, and I'm not trying to shit on John Collins, but giving him a max WILL cripple you. You dont give max money to players that aren't stars and expect to have a future, especially when Trae will take up 30 percent of the cap when his rookie deal is up. You gotta look towards the future"
"I mean, no, you just have to hit on draft picks, and get value wherever you can.  Considering we're talking about the team that got Trae with the 5th pick, JC with the 19th pick, Kevin Huerter with the 19th pick, swung the trade for buy low on Capela, etc. I have faith in our FO managing that stuff well.  Even Okongwu has had some terrific flashes in the playoffs, which for a rookie big man is a great look.   ------  I get your concern, but I don't think penny-pinching on John Collins is the way to go. Homegrown guy, been here through the rebuild, great synergy with Trae, great personality, bought into exactly the kind of culture McMillan is trying to build, and has stepped up in the playoffs when it's mattered the most.   ------------  In a technical sense, I'm sure the ""smart"" thing to do is to work a sign-and-trade or something for him, but the wise decision is to recognize the value he provides beyond the stat sheet, and the type of behavior that you want to reward when you're building the team identity for an organization that has literally never been as successful as they are right now."
John Collins is an underrated player. He is 2nd best player on Hawks. I would put him infront of Capela. Cant believe he is 19th pick. Do you think he gets max from Hawks?

"Tbf it‚Äôs an awful situation, and he hasn‚Äôt had time to grow his game with all of the injuries he‚Äôs had.   But it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs flashed anything amazing while he‚Äôs been on the court. He‚Äôs clearly a small ball 5 rn without enough offensive game to actually make him worth playing as a small ball 5.   He‚Äôs basically a poor man‚Äôs John Collins. But John is flashing some really competent defense this postseason so idk if you can say that anymore."
"No no no it was far easier to double against the Nets than it would be the Hawks. The Nets usually have 2 maybe 3 knockdown shooters on the court and that's including KD. If you sag off Bruce Brown he can't really punish you that hard, but if you take a guy off John Collins or Bogdan, they're gonna punish you from the midrange or three all night long. Trae Young would happily pass it off to one of those two, whereas for the Nets a heavily contested KD midrange is probably still one of their better options.  Also the reason that the Bucks defense started to collapse at the end was because they had to go small. Can't do anything about that Trae and Collins were clubbing them all night. If anything they changed it up a bit too late."
"Exactly, his value is already as low as it‚Äôs ever been. Sixers can‚Äôt come out and say ‚Äúwe have to trade him‚Äù otherwise his value tanks even more. They have to act like he will get better and that they trust that he will be better. That way at the negotiating table another team can‚Äôt fleece them. Problem is the damage is done. He sucks on offense. Doesn‚Äôt have a shot. Got called out by his teammate. His coach. And by national media. I think CJ is best value they can get back for him at this point. Unless there‚Äôs a John Collins sign and trade on the table?"
John Collins probably getting the max this off season?
"Even weirder, like ok that's not a pick or what ever but what's he guarding? John Collins is literally right there. They are literally double teaming the defender."
John Collins is hilarious and has always had a great personality. Glad people are finally getting to see it now that we are getting national attention.
Collins had a fun interview with the TNT team - the Hawks screech at the end between Shaq and John üòÖ
"Trae showed out and John Collins only missed like 4 shots out of i think 16?. However they only won by 3. As much as everyone‚Äôs ready to put them in the Finals already, I wouldn‚Äôt be so fast. Bucks shoot abysmal from 3 again and lose close. We‚Äôve seen them when they get rolling, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this series quickly goes 2-1 Bucks with a couple double digit wins."
"Trae would do the pause and look at John Collins before chasing after his own full court pass, catching it with ease and popping a 3 all in one motion.  *Plays Exodus theme and goes into slow-motion*"
john collins = polynesian
"I think Luka is better than Trae by slim margins, but I genuinely don't think this Hawks team would be better with Luka as opposed to Trae because of the way the teams been constructed. Luka is a lot more ball-dominant and would 100% ice guys like John Collins out of 2-3 games in any given series on the offensive end, maybe even leading him to a KP situation. I also don't see how he could have better synergy with Capela than someone like Trae either. I also agree that Luka is a great playmaker, but he doesn't touch the threshold of elite that Trae's tipped himself too this season after Nate's took over"
"Bogi can barely run his knee is so fucked. He's also performed pretty poorly the entire playoffs even before the he injury save a few games.  Gallo has been up and down. Has had some great offensive performances mixed in with some stinkers where he also got dominated on the boards and defensively  Huerter has been up and down minus his career game (game seven kevin)  Capela is really only a lob threat (which is still a great option for the offense in general) but for instance in the philly series he was almost completely a non factor on offense  The only dude on this list that has given the hox ""starter level"" play in terms of all star performance would be john collins minus one game where he got into foul trouble.  Trae is putting the team on his back in terms of scoring, controlling the pace of play, handling the ball (we don't actually have many good ball handlers lol), and setting up his teammates. It's the beauty of having a great point guard who can also score at will and is fast enough that even in the P&amp;R there is no answer."
I think winning just solves everything. There were talks about John Collins not being happy with Trae's style but those things go out the window when you're winning.
"Trae Donovan Mitchell  Ingram Zion Julius Randle  CJ McCullom  John Collins Liangelo  Playmaking, 3pt shooting, and muscle. Think that five is stronger than any starting five the current olympic team could make IMO. Didn't look it up but probably just named all the olympic camp alternate invites."
"I'll never not laugh at the john collins part, man."
Oh Johnny Collins is about to get the Max.   Trae is about to the Max.   Huerter is going to get PAAIIIDDD!   I think Red Velvet will get a huge contract. The resslers need to keep this core together for one more year.   But I do think both John Collins and Trae young will get Max
I mean look at what legends have won at his age. You got Magic and Kobe. Both had somebody like Kareem and Shaq. Trae has John Collins.  You'd have to put above Dame.
"He's the ""starting PF"" so Kings fans have a player in the starting 5. Realistically he gets subbed off after 4 minutes and John Collins plays there the rest of the game"
Trae Young &gt; Greek Cheeks  John Collins &gt; Trash Money  Lou Williams &gt; Jrue ISuckToday  Hawks in 4
"Fun fact: John Collins was born in the same metropolitan area where Damian Lillard went to college, which is the Ogden-Clearfield Metropolitan area of Davis County, Utah."
Don't forget there was also some sort of tension between John Collins and Trae Young. Wonder if making it this far into the playoffs made them respect eachother more.
"It still amazes me, even after all these years, that there are folks who are 6'8 &amp; 6'9, and able to things like John Collins does. The tallest person I met &amp; knew was 6'8. And he looked like a lumbering giant who was stuck in 2nd gear."
"I don‚Äôt think you guys are in bad shape at all. But next year it looks like you‚Äôre at around 96M without the John Collins extension (not sure if he stays or goes). Still - maneuverable pieces between Collins, Gallo, picks, etc‚Ä¶ plus a ton of young talent."
John Collins has springs man. He's a great member of that team
I am not talking about Ayton's game winner yesterday. I'm talking about Trae Young's alley-oop off the backboard to John Collins today. That occured while Trae was driving to the rim
"""John Collins is my best friend"""
"Not many big players in the league more athletic than John Collins, and Capela led the NBA in rebounds this year."
He‚Äôd probably force John Collins to stand in a corner all game and never pass him the ball
"Ahh ok, even still weren‚Äôt there warriors players that couldn‚Äôt stand mark Jackson? I don‚Äôt doubt that hawks players didn‚Äôt care for Lloyd especially trae and John Collins"
"Shaq was being pedantic as shit.  The whole problem Kenny and Chuck had is that Jrue Holiday was left on an island and trying to keep Young in front of him while John Collins was lurking to screen him out of the play while Bobby Portis chilled under the rim. Chuck is right, that play was a microcosm of the Bucks defense on Young all game."
They tested John Collins after some slams in the beginning of last season lmao   Except he was actually possibly found guilty
"So I had to work tonight and couldn't watch the game. In fact, I actually forgot that there was even a game tonight at all. Anyway, I was out on a pizza delivery and I just so happened to glance up at the nearest building and had to do a double take because it was the CP3 basketball academy in Winston-Salem. I didn't even know that was a thing until today.   Then I come home and turn on the game and I see Chris Paul celebrating with Devin Booker and Monty Williams on the sideline as the final two minutes tick down. CP3 is going to the NBA Finals!  I grew up a Tar Heel, but always had a soft spot for Wake Forest, especially since as a kid I was able to go to a couple games with my dad as we got the tickets for free. Wake doesn't produce a lot of NBA players, which makes the fact that both Chris Paul AND John Collins are both balling out in their respective conference finals even more insane and exciting for the city of Winston.  If the Hawks beat the Bucks and we get a Suns/Hawks finals, it would be both insanely fun to watch and pretty special for my city. Maybe we could get a hype video featuring B.o.B. (Winston-born) and SAS narrating or something (he went to Winston-Salem State University). Probably not haha"
I mean Middleton is the 2nd best player on Milwaukee (and the best available) and John Collins is the real deal.
Why y‚Äôall hating on my boy John Collins I love him
"Don‚Äôt be hating on John Collins my dudes, dude is solid"
~~John Collins~~ K'von Heurter
Can‚Äôt believe the two biggest players we have for bucks hawks is Khash Middleton and John Collins lol
Using John Collins and Middleton to advertise the bucks hawks game lol
John Collins and Khris Middleton headlining the ECFs LOL
Lmao John Collins vs. Khris Middleton
"Ah yes, John Collins vs Middleton. The marquee matchup"
"I wouldn‚Äôt call him a bust yet. He plays a limited roll on a team that signed a ton of vets. Even then he‚Äôs actually getting minutes and contributing. Watching him play, he‚Äôs unrefined on offense but he seems to have solid defensive instincts. Depending on where John Collins ends up, I‚Äôd suspect he might get more playing time in the near future."
"Hawks don‚Äôt have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
Who did Jokic beat up?   We both saw Embiid dive into John Collins' legs.
"Giannis, Ja, john Collins, DJJ, miles bridges and last but definitely not least, Reggie Jackson  I‚Äôll see myself out."
"John Collins, Gallo, huerter, and Capela are all better than Lukas third option in porzingis lmao. Team talent has Always mattered, the hawks have a better supporting cast and it‚Äôs not really debatable. Suns beat lebron because AD was out and his supporting cast sucked, not because anyone on the suns is as good as lebron. Same thing happened to KD."
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"There's plenty of debates on who to choose between Sabonis and Turner. The thing is they kind of do complement each other but if Sabonis had a John Collins build (i.e. if he was an actual 4 that isn't a black hole on the perimeter) then it'd be a solid pairing.  Turner provides rim protection and 3-point shooting  Sabonis provides interior scoring and rebounding   Sabonis has shown a ton of tangible improvement from year to year. Turner hasn't, but he's our defensive anchor.   Either way, if we trade out one of them we're probably going to get a solid stretch 4 back (I don't think any wings are available and TJ Warren has struggled to defender bigger 4's in the past). I'm high on PJ Washington as an acceptable guy to get back.  And yeah no shit, we draft awful."
"Well, let's put this into perspective.  Bogi is new, Gallo has always been a plus player.  John Collins is versatile but not dominant at any one thing.  Cam Reddish and Hunter are in their 2nd yrs.  Add to that with no national exposure and you have the current recipe of talent with no recognition.  Four weeks ago, people were laughing at Trae Young being called a star.  To put it in prospective, even Ja Morant didn't make the teams.  Young players normally don't get proper recognition."
"Shot creators mean they can simply create shots for themselves. Hunter and reddish can, they don‚Äôt require a clear setup. I‚Äôm not sure how you don‚Äôt consider themselves on that level.   The reason I mentioned lob threats, in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, is that the hawks have the most lobs, which is part of the reason capela has been so good. Our big men don‚Äôt have to create for themselves, and with traes floater, have one of the best offensive systems in the league. Lobs might not be as valuable for other teams, but it fits our team perfectly, and John Collins is already top 5 in the league at it.   Isolation possessions don‚Äôt determine whether you can create your shot, there‚Äôs so many other statistics. Gary Trent and jalen Brunson are below 5 percent, they obviously create their own shot. The statistics you used don‚Äôt tell an accurate picture at all."
"I clearly think Trae and Huerter can. I very explicitly say that they do.  I don't think that Hunter or Reddish can to the level that I would consider them shot creators.   &gt;Or that John Collins or okongwu aren‚Äôt premier lob threats  I haven't talked about that at all, not sure why you keep mentioning it. Lob threats aren't that individually valuable.   &gt;because I‚Äôm not sure how either of those statements are disproved by stats.  Well I gave you the isolation numbers to show that volume and the success"
"I‚Äôm not sure what part you don‚Äôt agree with. You think reddish, hunter, Huerter, and trae can‚Äôt all create their own shot? Or that John Collins or okongwu aren‚Äôt premier lob threats, because I‚Äôm not sure how either of those statements are disproved by stats."
" &gt;Hunter was absolutely creating his own this season  I didn't say he wasn't, I said that his volume and results on that shot creation aren't impressive.   &gt;The only part of our young core that can‚Äôt create their own shot is John Collins and okongwu, but they‚Äôre already premier lob threat which is what trae needs anyway.  And I don't agree with that based on the games I've seen and the stats.   &gt;Also hunter pre-injury was putting up 17.5 points on ridiculous efficiency plus is by far our best 2 way player, he can definitely develop into a clear cut second option.  That doesn't make him a star to me."

everyone wants to see john collins vs khris middleton
So who‚Äôs the Hawks best player right now?  There‚Äôs a good chance Game 5 will be headlined by Khris Middleton and John Collins. That‚Äôs sad.
Capela should pull a John Collins and get a shirt made of that shot.
I‚Äôll respond to this post with the famous words of John Collins   CAW CAW
The emotional heart of the team is John Collins.  The rational heart of the team is Alpha 0G7dg4F - the android we drafted from Cal Tech.

Trae Youngs injured and John Collins is only going to score 4 points? This was obviously going to be a 20+ point game. The hawks just forgot they were supposed to be the losing team.
"Lmk when Clint Capela, John Collins, or Kevin Huerter hit back to back deep pull-up threes late in the 4th quarter of an elimination game pal..."
"I watched every minute. John Collins set amazing screens was active as fuck on the boards made middleton ineffective and moved the ball incredibly well. Plus, and I know you're not a hawks fan so this isnt a big deal, plus he threw an oop to capela. Usually hes the one catching them. He had an incredible game and we dont win this without him."
Does this mean John Collins is about to bust out a Meteor Jam?  Because I'm for it.
"I think this is more what I was getting at. Either Jrue isn't a top 30ish player, or Khris isn't, or something. But they can't both be on-ball top-30 guys surrounded by a good defense and still be underdogs to a team whose best player is... John Collins? Kevin Huerter? Lou Williams?"
So because other players randomly got hurt (last I checked John Collins is totally fine) that warrants another player getting randomly hurt..... Got it. Not really the definition of Karma unless Giannis did something malicious but ok.
"Ask John Collins, Anthony Davis and Kyrie IrvingÔºü"
‚ÄúSome team that missed out on John Collins in the 2017 draft might get a second chance at him now‚Äù  *Laughs in TJ Leaf*
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
Lou Williams - 7 million   kevin huerter - 2.6 million   John Collins- 2.7 million   clint capela- 15.5 million   bogdan bogdanovic- 18 million   Ummmm should I even put the bucks starting 5 salary? Lol
"&gt;Again, there are fake narratives as it pertains to Luka because of people who love their great white hope.  Yeah I see now. This was never going to be a logical discussion.  &gt; No you don‚Äôt, ha. It‚Äôs not even close and that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre good at other things in life though.   You're right about one thing. It's not close. But it's not in favor of you. But keep talking about your players with one liners in arguments like ""John Collins can't stay out of foul trouble"" and ""Lou Williams sucks at defense"" as such robust analysis.  I see you conveniently deleted your earlier post. Get some rest bud."
John Collins putting Erwin Smith numbers here.
Not to mention John Collins wasn't exactly contributing..
Except he had the biggest +-? He played great tonight. John Collins makes winning basketball plays. Ultimate glue guy for our team.
"Is there a larger gap in player performances? He ate us alive game 3. TBF, we made adjustments and out taller and stronger John Collins on him so he couldnt play bully ball as well"
"John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Cam Reddish outworked the entire Bucks team tonight. Bogi and Lou Will provided much needed buckets. OO is the best Giannis defender in NBA? HAWKS IN SIX!"
"Jordan can drop 60 all his wants but it doesn‚Äôt matter when the hawks drain 10-30 3 pointers over let‚Äôs see... john paxson/steve kerr, horace grant, kukoc... Jordan will drop 60, sure. Pippen may get his 20 piece but what about the rest? Trae gonna drop 30-50, Huerter 15-20, Bogdan 10-20, Capela 10-20+10-20rb, then there‚Äôs collins and reddish. Bulls would get destroyed bro"
Sometimes they're John Collins and Kyle Kuzma
John Collins didn't contribute much with his 4 pts either..  This was a weird game.
"They offered him an extension and he declined it. I know he has issues with not being offered the max and the team‚Äôs focus on Trae amongst other things. Really hope he sticks, continues to develop, and this team does well.   Source: https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/01/15/report-hawks-offered-john-collins-more-than-90m-on-contract-extension/"
https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/john-collins-atlanta-hawks-nba-basketball-playoffs  I feel this john.
Nba finals gonna be John Collins and Kevin Heurter vs Terrence Mann and Patrick Beverly at this rate.
"No Trae, John Collins scored 4 points, and somehow ATL is leading by over 20 points with 3+ mins left.  WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?   Go ATL!!!!!!"
"Does John Collins still want to leave? I remember his reasoning was he wanted to be a part of a ship run, and this team is doing exactly that"
"I admit it, I am a John Collins fan. I celebrate the guy's entire game. For my money, it doesn't get any better than when he hits a well-defended turnaround jumper."
John ‚ÄúSenior Chief Executive Vibes Officer‚Äù Collins
"Bruh Embiid carried my team with a torn meniscus. And John collins had the nerve to wear a shirt showcasing his offensive foul on Embiid (who was called for the defensive foul lol). It should have been the sixers year, and yes, I am salty."
Grant Williams and Al Horford for John Collins. Who says no?
John Collins is that dude
"Love how my boy John Collins only has 2 points, yet leads the game at +22."
John Collins man I love you but you can‚Äôt ask for a max putting up 2 points when Trae isn‚Äôt even out there
John Collins was waiving the fans off to stop them from cheering when Joel appeared to be hurt..
If you haven't read John Collins Players Tribune from yesterday I highly recommend it!    https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/john-collins-atlanta-hawks-nba-basketball-playoffs
I thought you and John Collins were beefing?
"I mean Julius did shoot near 40% from three and he's better at everything else. If we are talking playoff Gulius then yeah obv I don't want him but that's a 2nd team all NBA player were talking about I think. Most countries aren't gonna have a John Collins Clint Capela DeAndre Hunter rotation guarding him, I think he would be better. I don't think it's a choice based on race I think it's based off of name recognition but either way I'd rather have Randle."
"Fouls called on every play, unless John Collins has the ball"
"""IT SMELLS LIKE RED VELVET IN HERE! SO VELVETY!"" -- John Collins"
John Collins made the entire team watch Naruto episodes after last game
They relocate to Seattle. Coach Pierce is unfortunately never fired and they continue to be dismal for the rest of the decade. John Collins gets maxed and averages 27/11 for a team that never cracks 50 wins.
"Tragic John Collins always in foul trouble, his next area of growth is being able to defend without fouling, they need you out there bro"
Surprised John Collins finally got a foul called for him
"Man I really like John Collins. He‚Äôs gonna be a tough player, idk about all star but he‚Äôs going to be a major player for a while"
Really hope John Collins doesn't spend all game on the bench again.
Loooool who needs Trae Young when you have generational assist man John Collins
John Collins opportunity to shine tonight
"I never saw John Collins play until these playoffs.. and from what I can tell, he isn't a max player at all."
John Collins? He's good right? Please tell me he's good...
"I mean when you look at the entire resume from 12-now it looks kinda bad, but I think their front office has taken some pretty big swings and misses in the draft and free agency. Carlisle kept them at a league average floor. Like everyone points at Donovan Mitchell there for them in 2017, but fuck if DSJ was like Jarrett Allen or John Collins they'd probably still be bad enough to have gotten Luka in 2018 and have been more competitive these last couple years."
"That‚Äôs the thing is though, we‚Äôre comparing it to super teams we‚Äôve seen within recent years but we need to realize that the Golden State Warriors having 4 All Stars on one team is something we see probably 2-3 times every 20 years. That was a dynasty. Yes most teams usually have a 2nd all star so to use that comparison is understandable but even with that being said, I don‚Äôt think this Hawks team is far off from in the future having 2-3 All Stars. They might not be now but they still have a great team where I can see Trae being an All Star and Kevin Huerter/John Collins well."
"John Collins had one of the best post-game interviews after they won game one in MIL, so funny and so likeable, will be one of my favorite players from now on"
John Collins is our longest tenured player in his 4th year. Kinda crazy to think about as a hawks fan but it‚Äôs a credit to how fast this rebuild has been
"Dude exactly (idk how unpopular this is)  Some team that missed out on John Collins in the 2017 draft might get a second chance at him now that he's closer to his prime because the Hawks are too good at drafting (Trae, Huerter, Hunter, and Reddish [who we haven't seen much of this postseason but I think he can still be a good wing])  I don't know what the solution is"
Top 10 Active Players Remaining:  1) Giannis  2) Paul George  3) Devin Booker  4) Trae Young  5) DeAndre Ayton  6) Khris Middleton  7) Jrue Holiday  8) Chris Paul  9) Reggie Jackson  10) John Collins
John Collins is Trae's best friend.
"Espn is the new mtv,many have stopped watching  it because the channel  dropped the real reason people originally   watched it. Maybe that reason wasn't profitable so I get it.  On Jalen Rose, Kevin Love  is a guy who I said retired years ago but didnt tell anyone.   I don't know if he made the team because he is white but I do know other guys like Brook Lopez , John Collins even a Robert Covington deserved the slot more and bring more to the table. Because with that roster what he brings is redundant, he only brings they say experience. Outside shooting debatable.  And for Jalen, Ayton played on the Bahamas team so I don't know if he can play for team USA.  If you can't prove what you say might as well keep it to yourself."
"i know this is probably a troll job on his wikipedia page, but major john wall energy here lol  ""On June 29, 2021, it was reported that Collins had somehow managed to re-fracture his foot despite not participating in basketball activities for over 6 months, seemingly from walking to the mailbox."""
John Collins seems to love us in the A. Trae too but JC with that last article really made me feel some type of way.
"Portland would have made out way better just keeping the picks and choosing any two of Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White instead."
"John Collins just seems like a great guy. He first caught my attention when he and some other players participated in the Atlanta Pride parade. It felt pretty awesome that a male professional athlete in the South was willing to be so openly supportive. Now, in this write up, he shout outs the Atlanta Dream. Nobody would have criticized him if he hadn't mentioned them (after all, it's an essay about the Hawks team) so it's super cool that he went out of his way to include them."
Where do I join the John Collins fan club

"Read his crunchyroll interview lol. Dude has Naruto collectibles and clothing lol.  &gt;When did you become an anime fan?  Was there a specific moment that affected you or changed the way you felt about something?   &gt;   &gt;**John Collins:** I was first introduced to this world at the lunch tables in elementary school. My friends talked about the show Naruto a ton, and we discussed it constantly at school, so the show quickly became my favorite. I have so many fond memories of playing on the jungle gym and pretending I was a ninja while I was living in Washington. Even now, when I watch old reruns of the show, I‚Äôm reminded of those memories that made me fall in love with anime.   &gt;   &gt;Are there any ways you engage with your favorite anime series or characters aside from watching them?   &gt;   &gt;**John Collins:** Over the years, I‚Äôve built a collection of Naruto clothing and figurines. I love this stuff! It includes some Dragon Ball Z items too.   &gt;   &gt;Have you ever bonded with someone else over anime?   &gt;   &gt;**John Collins**: I‚Äôve definitely bonded with my teammates over our love for anime. We always have something to discuss about the storylines and character development.

John Collins is such a likeable guy. Good for him showing out these playoffs...dudes about to get paid
"I love that NBA players still do secret handshakes.   Off court leadership is so necessary, and it sounds like John Collins knows that. Seems like a great guy."
Clearly you guys have the upper hand. But dammit I am falling in love with this scrappy team real talk. Every team need a John Collins. Dude is a flat out dawg
Damn I love John Collins
"Prejudice and racism aren't the same. What Jalen said was prejudice but not quite racism. I think what he is saying is ""true"" but not the best way to say it. If he would have said nepotism then the quote would have sounded better.  He equated someone no longer being qualified for a job but being selected anyway to how he would view himself in that position. Let's face it, both men and women Team USA basketball is a political choice rather than selecting the best players that want to play for that year. K Love has quit on Cleveland more than once, why should he get selected over another younger American big man? Myles Turner, John Collins, or Julius Randle would have been a much better choice."
"He was super chill when I once met him in the most random of ways.    His rookie year, my wife and I were walking out of an Atlanta United game (in which they beat the NE Revolution 7-0....) and I was looking at this guy in front of us who was really tall.  And I'm like ""Baby, I know that guy but I can't put my finger on it.""  She was like, is he an athlete or something?  He turns around and I literally blurt out ""HOLY SHIT IT'S JOHN COLLINS!""    Dude was just like ""What's up man!""  I say ""Hey"", and ""good luck the rest of this year!"" and he responds with ""Thanks!"" and goes about his way.  He was literally by himself, just walking back to go home or whatever, and no one realized who he was.  Kind of surreal but also an awesome experience at the same time."
"I hooked up with a girl for awhile that previously had a thing with John Collins, and have a few mutual friends with him. From what I hear, he‚Äôs a good ass dude. Deserves it all."
"Capela, Lopez, and Ayton all play a huge part on their teams. The Hawks desperately need Capela's rebounding and screen setting. The Bucks entire defensive identity is based on Lopez. Ayton is consistently the third threat on offense and a solid screen setter, which unlocks Paul's and Booker's midrange game. Do you seriously believe that the Bucks with Connaughton in, the Suns without Ayton, and the Hawks running John Collins at the 5 are better than when they have their centers in? This take is wildly wrong. People see a small ball lineup work and lose their fucking minds."
Idk man yeah John Collins might not be worth a max but who is the alternative? What max guy would you be able to get instead?
John collins is not worth the max.
"Thing is, it will probably be super hard to get minutes on the Hawks. Behind Capela, Okongwu, and potentially John Collins still."
I think they are 1 star away from being a legit title contender. I think Cam Reddish can become something special. John Collins has been great but if they can flip him for a star player i'd take that risk. They already have great depth
Don't forget my boy John Collins lmao
Can we agree John Collins is not a max contract player?
John Collins simply doesn‚Äôt have it defensively.
lol John Collins clapped at him
RIP To any team offering John Collins any type of money üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I both hate how John Collins looks and I‚Äôm simultaneously attracted to him?
"Dame-Beal-Tatum-Durant-Adebayo should smoke opposing teams out the gate  Lavine, Grant, Draymond can fill up minutes  Holiday, Booker, Middleton 15mpg  Love gets participation award? I don't understand his role, John Collins or Jarrett Allen would've been better"
"This is legit their one shot. You got John ""KG/TD"" Collins from middie, and Cam ""Is he the 3rd Splash Bro?"" Reddish on fire from deep. Just have Trae do his one leg Harden thing by setting them up and let Gallo and Bogie do their thing when they get the rock."
John Collins learning his acting from trae. That's disgraceful
"Holy shit, John Collins!"
John Collins is just an east side Kuzma
JOHN COLLINS DOES NOT DESERVE A MAX
The John Collins max is gonna be hilarious
John Collins has been doodoo lately
John Collins gets call for a questionable travel calls?
I pity the fool who offers John Collins anywhere near a max
Never forget John Collins had the corniest dunk contest gimmick of all time
"I hate to see John Collins pump faking and never shooting.  Dude can score, but nobody respects his shot and biting on that pump fake."
Does John Collins still get maxed
Come on John Collins make your presence known
John Collins is completely terrified to shoot.
John Collins had to grab the rim since PJ Tucker undercut him and still ended up taking a hard foul.  Ouch
Basket interference from John Collins? Should‚Äôve waved off the basket for hanging on the rim when the ball didn‚Äôt go through yet
John Collins real clutch
Did Shaq right now break health and safety protocols for John collins with the contact at the end
"John Collins sign and trade. We need some defense and could use the extra passing at the 4.  John really only rebounds, dunks, and shoots open 3s, and Ben can do 2/3 of those and defend at a high level so I think it's a win.   I think Ben is a decent guy who has been really beaten down and Coach Mac can hopefully get him to believe in himself. Even if Ben doesn't develop a jumpshot but just goes all in on paint scoring then he could be like Sabonis with great defense which is still an excellent player.   Maybe it could be a three team trade so Philly gets a pg from someone in exchange"
John Collins straight up. He can just be what JC already is but with elite defense. Imagine a small ball lineup of Trae Kev Cam Hunter Ben.
Because John Collins is the height of a forward but the weight of a guard
John Collins is a poor man's Kemp.
Capela looked hungover last night and John Collins historically is just not big enough or strong enough to handle traditional bigs
"Trash talking when losing needs to be smarter than what john collins did imo. Saying you aint that strong after getting bodied 3 times in a row is not going to get under giannis' skin. In fact, it's gonna make him realize you're a bitch."
No but if you max him you're basically saying that he's your second best or second most important player on your team and you're probably not going too far if you have John Collins as your second best guy.
"Idk about Embiid. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love him, but considering his pregame antics and not being afraid to publicly roll teammates under the bus, I don‚Äôt think we can call him class. Now Middleton, that man is pure class. John Collins, too"
John Collins is a fucking bitch. Dude talks the most shit but gets bulldozed by everybody
John Collins is nothing without Trae
Bobby Portis tough guy: John Collins wanna be tough guy.
"""He ain't a max player""  ~literally everyone talking about John Collins"
‚ÄúNobody bullies John Collins five times in a row without shooting free throws‚Äù

John Collins is athletic Bobby Portis with a 100 million contract is going to be my favorite hot take next year.
John Collins talks a little too much for how good he actually is
And then Giannis bullied him the next game lol John Collins thinks he‚Äôs way better than what he actually is. Only reason he‚Äôs relevant is because of Trae and tonight showed it.
John Collins has a Sam Darnold level punchable face
John Collins karma night
John collins apologized for getting hit in the head.
"Bruh this ain‚Äôt it. Tryna act better than ppl because you enjoy these playoffs and not ‚Äúcomforted by repetition‚Äù. Enjoy the playoffs if u want, I still am but I think it‚Äôs understandable that ppl didn‚Äôt rly want to see a Middleton vs John Collins battle in the ECF"
Like hell John Collins is moved for Oubre without probably both picks.
"John Collins is like our only guy that gets boards lol. Got a good, efficient 3. Hits the alley oops like no one else. Do you watch games?"
Like 30ish. Around where John Collins is.
John Collins being one of the most overpaid NBA players in history
"This guy always filled the stats sheet as well every time he got heavy minutes during the regular season as well.  Seems like a great cheap alternative to signing John Collins for $20 million plus /yr, and he's only 2 years older than Collins"
"I personally think the need for a true center isnt that big of a deal. All we need is a center who is a passable lob threat and mainly can defend and rebound. Those guys are quite available in the league, hell powell was just about there before he tore his achilles. John collins being a fantastic rebounder and decent scorer is a great fit and moves the needle more than a good center (unless that center is embiid or AD lol).  I think if we take collins, the first half of the season should absolutely be played to incorporate him into the scheme as well as let porzingis shine as much as we can. Then we should look to trade porzingis for either a good defender/slasher or secondary playmaker. I know alot of people here dont think porzingis is the issue with dallas but he is just a bad fit next to luka mainly due to his ability to create his own shot and his terrible defence and rebounding. If he somehow fixes his defence and rebounding then maybe he can be kept but otherwise i thinm trading him would be good (if we get john collins that is)."
Honetly cant dallas sign him after we lose THJ and Jrich? John collins feels like a good fit next to Luka and im not sure if there are better FA options available (assuming kawhis rumours are BS).
This is how John Collins and Capela normally play when there‚Äôs no Trae to spoon feed them buckets.   This sub would actually have you believe John Collins is worth a max
"I know someone is going to give him a max deal and the Hawks may match it, but I'd really love for John Collins to be anything other than just a guy at any point consistently. Huerter sucked but consistency has always been an issue with him. Capela isn't really useful on offense without Trae. They need Collins to step up and be the man and he just blends into the scenery way too much.  Maybe it wouldn't have mattered because the Hawks just couldn't get stops, but damn man, the Collins thing is going to be a problem this offseason."
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Hawks game when an gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just John Collins and Kevin Huerter bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!

It helps when he has 200 pounds of john collins guarding him tho
I'd rather get Portis on the cheap than John Collins at $20 million plus
Okungwu hasn‚Äôt proven anything yet and John Collins isn‚Äôt gonna be elite at one aspect like one of those 3. They‚Äôre gonna be a 4/5 seed every year with this roster construction

John Collins has been BASURA!
John Collins getting some karma there

John Collins would be lucky to get a Bobby Portis contract. His effort is pathetic this game.
John Collins needs to be useful.
John Collins is useless on both ends. Undersized 4 so he‚Äôs getting eaten up on defense and he has no offensive moves
"I read something that we said we weren‚Äôt gonna pay more than market value for demar. So whatever the fuck that means. I think it means we aren‚Äôt gonna pay him 20 mil, but would pay the MLE or whatever. I think we‚Äôre still trying to get John Collins. I keep checking for updates on him, but haven‚Äôt read anything."
If anything I think that getting Trae's extension had to be done first to get the details right for John Collins.
"Definitely not for young stars/faces of the franchise like SGA and Trae. The issue will come with second-tier guys, like John Collins is going through now with Atlanta."
We got the Trae contract sorted out before the John Collins contract the HE GONE-o-meter just rose by 5% damn

"if he goes to the Bulls it's gonna be a s&amp;t for Markenan, but it feels like the Spurs might shoot their shot with John Collins first."
Rumor was yesterday that John Collins had an agreement in place for 5/120. If we can get him back with that it would be amazing. Shit even 4/120 would be great.
john collins is maybe our 3rd best player
"Derozan, John Collins, Scrotum just to name a few key names that haven't moved yet.  76ers I sorta feel bad for you on this Simmons bs LOL"
"Man i thought this was for John Collins at first lol. This is still a solid deal tho. If he ever figures it out he could be great. You'd prefer this to be a two year deal but the salary isn't bad and the Spurs need to take risks, especially on bigs."
Hawks might lose John Collins. How can they be no doubt lol
Demar sign and trade for John Collins???
"John Collins is a much better shooter than Zach Collins, but both are best when used as a rim runner.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend that much money on 3 players when you won‚Äôt be able to have them on the floor at the same time, as none of them can realistically play the 3 or 5 without being abused defensively."
I can‚Äôt wait for the days when the league is dominated by the ferocious duo of John Collins and Josh Primo.
+John Collins.
I had to reread it several times and my first viewing was ‚ÄúJohn Collins real name is Zach?‚Äù
"those are mostly middling though, our biggest shot for a high draft pick next year (Chet or Paulo) or the year after (Victor) is our own.  It's no big secret that we need a big man.  (After that obviously we're hoping that the Clippers implode and whatnot)  And if we're not in the lottery next year we straight lose our pick (Hawks get it at 15-30 as part of the Schroder trade that seems like it happened a million years ago at this point).  Don't forget with Shai healthy we were 16-19 last season, and I think with John Collins that could easily push us over the top and wind up in an uncomfortable play-in situation."
"I don't understand why more fans don't have this perspective. Everyone isn't going to be able to legitimately compete, why not settle for having a fun team of likeable players who you've already seen play well for your team? Reward the guys who performed good last year and roll the dice on doing the same or improving this year.   It's like the Hawks fans who get mad at the thought of overpaying John Collins, I don't care if it's an overpay: I love that man and want to lock him down."

NICE NOW DO JOHN COLLINS RE-SIGN WITH HAWKS PLEASE
"I was hoping for John Collins not Zach. But a big and shooting? I know we're still gonna be trash, but that's at least what we needed"
"My fried brain read this as Zach Lavine, and then John Collins lol. I legitimately forgot Zach Collins existed."
"Wrong Collins Spurs.   You're supposed to go after JOHN Collins, not Zach"
"Yeah, sometimes it doesn't work out, and they're not all-NBA guys. But Lonzo is already a plus on both ends.  John Collins has shown he can do all kinds of stuff on an NBA court. Gary Trent is already a very good shooter, has decent size at the 2, and is still 22.   There's no ceiling with McDermott."
"For quite a moment I thought about John Collins instead of Zach and got so confused, lmao"
Spurs think they got John Collins
"spurs thought they were getting john collins on a steal here, gonna be real upset in a week when they find out"
#WHO ELSE HAS CAP SPACE FOR JOHN COLLINS NOW?!??
Step 1: Max John Collins at 6:00 on the dot.   Step 2: Call Lonzo's people and offer to beat any contract offer they receive at 6:01.  Step 3: Call Gary Trent's people at 6:02 and do the same thing.
‚Ä™Yesssss less room for a John Collins offer. ‚Ä¨
John Collins is only tier 2?
Good what about John Collins please?
John Collins loves this
John Collins to the Spurs
"Malik Monk to the Celtics, John Collins to the Spurs, Melo to the Suns."
"Spurs max John Collins, Hawks don‚Äôt match"
"&gt; Is that biting you in the ass because it was a bad decision or just unlucky?   Both.  Collins being injured all the time isn't Olshey's fault.  We'd absolutely be a better team if Collins could actually play.    However, going 2-for-1 in a deep draft on a fairly risky pick (Collins wasn't considered an NBA prospect out of HS, didn't start at Gonzaga, and half of his games were against crappy WCC teams).  Its not even clear that we couldn't have snagged Collins at 15, and if not our consolation prizes looked pretty good.    I agree with you that Portland might be 1 move away from being a genuine contender, but that 2017 draft was a massive missed opportunity where Portland could have had Bam, Mitchell, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG.  Any one of those guys would have been a really big deal for us and it didn't happen.    Also there is the 25 pick where we grabbed Swanigan, who is out of the league, who got followed up with Kuzma, Bradley, White, and Josh Hart.    That draft was a complete mess for Portland, and Collins' being constantly turned it into a disaster.  I also think Olshey deserves a ton of criticism for the 2016 offseason where we threw giant contracts at Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard, and Harkless, tying up our money for years.    All said and done, I don't think Olshey is a complete idiot, and there are certainly worse GMs in the league.  I just don't think he's capable of putting together a championship team and there is plenty of criticism that can be launched at him."
Would you rather Allen for 5/100 or John Collins for 5/125?
"That's true, just like how John Collins has publicly demanded a trade from Atlanta, or Jimmy Butler demanded a trade from Chicago, or Beal demanded a trade from Washington, or Ingram demanded a trade from New Orleans, or..."
Lowry would help but Derozan doesn‚Äôt fit that group.  You‚Äôd need another shooter in that spot. You‚Äôd be much better off with a shooting big like John Collins
"I‚Äôd love to see who Kawhi‚Äôs dream team would be. He seems to have a really good grasp on team basketball. I assume playing on the Spurs and raptors for so long has made him averse to selfish teammates. He also turned down the Lakers so I assume he wouldn‚Äôt want just an all star crew.   I think he‚Äôd want a lineup like: Lowry, Jimmy Buckets (or PG), Kawhi, John Collins, and Nurkic. Like dudes who are tough as hell, vocal, and can play D and shoot."
Zach Lavine is on another planet compared to John Collins.
"I was thinking the same, but now a days if you have anything close to all star level talent you‚Äôre basically forced to max them. With my hawks, I really don‚Äôt wanna max John Collins but we kind of have to"
"Celtics getting Trae Young, John Collins, Magic City and at least 2 of the Migos."
"Run for the hills, John Collins !"
We‚Äôve hit the threshold ladies and gentleman. Ben Simmons is being compared to a Walmart brand (cuz I know y‚Äôall love them everyday low prices) John Collins. If Morey could hear r/nba or at least be influenced by public opinion now would be the time to trade for Simmons.   Btw John Collins at home is Jamychael Green
Trae Young   De‚ÄôAndre Hunter   Cam Reddish  John Collins   Jalen Johnson
"Get 2 of Oubre, Markkanen, John Collins, Duncan Robinson.  Go into next year with a core of: DWhite, Dejounte, Keldon, Vassell, Poeltl, 2FA, Lonnie, and see how things shake out with the young guys to see if we continue down the path or piece off some stuff for future assets.  I‚Äôd be excited to watch a team of 22-28 year olds w no stars and no bad players and just see how it goes."
He or John Collins could fit well with the Spurs with their need for frontcourt players.
"&gt;already having 1 player makes us better than most teams  Yeah I totally agree, I guess I kind of misinterpreted the point that OP was trying to make. Trae is the distinguishing factor, watching the Hawks' playoff run made that pretty clear. You can't consider your young core on par with theirs until you have a superstar at that level.  That being said, I think the rest of the young talent on the Hornets is at least comparable to the Hawks. Miles Bridges/PJ Washington are similar tier prospects to DeAndre Hunter/Cam Reddish, John Collins is a tier above right now but tbh I have faith that Miles can reach that level of production next season. Possible we lose one of them this summer but Devonte Graham/Malik Monk is a similar level to Kevin Huerter. We're kind of just banking on LaMelo having Trae Young-type progression through his 2nd/3rd season to try and be as competitive as they were but obviously there's no guarantee in that happening."
Probably stems from ‚Äúhe‚Äôs skinny so if he bulks up he must become an MVP and DPOY just look at what Giannis did!‚Äù  Honestly I see Wood very similarly to John Collins last year. Collins probably put up better stats tbh
Deandre hunter looked like a beast last year before he got hurt and huerter has had some big playoff games already. And it seems like it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Reddish puts it all together. John Collins is also really good.
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"Until they have a player better than Trae Young, and a 2nd player better than John Collins, Ima say no."
"&gt; Age doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you haven‚Äôt improved at all in 4 years.  Who cares, the man started off at a really high level and despite popular belief he did get better - not shooting but other things yes. He's been an all star level player for three years. When you're already at such a high level what kind of jump are realistically expecting.....  shooting is nice but Ben is a big man, why hasn't non-shooting been an issue for any other big men in teh history of the NBA for fans to turn on them like they have with Ben to the point you can't recognize his accomplishments.   Siakam isn't as good as Ben right now, Siakam can just shoot a bit better but he's still a bad shooter compared to the rest of the NBA. Siakam's offensive woes are also well documented. IF you think he can cook John Collins, you're wrong. He's limited in what he can do too. He's still mr.beyblade man."
"Siakams skillset is easily more valuable in the playoffs, he would‚Äôve feasted on john collins as a second option next to Embiid. Age doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you haven‚Äôt improved at all in 4 years. Simmons theoretical upside is higher than Siakams but it seems increasingly unlikely he ever reaches it."
Yes. I'd rather sign him than John Collins.
"Minnesota should be on the list for John Collins (S+T), but I bet he re-signs with Atlanta too.    My prediction is Minnesota will sign or trade for a F/C that no one thinks they‚Äôll get.  Could sign JaMychal Green to the MLE, could trade for Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Jonathan Isaac, etc.     Something is definitely in the works."
John ‚ÄúMax‚Äù Collins
John Collins was picked outside the lottery at #20 but otherwise agreed
"Collins is a Utah kid and the Jazz are actually winning, so I imagine if he does consider other suitors, Utah would be somewhere he'd much prefer to San Antonio or something. But don't the Jazz also need to make a decision on Mike Conley? And Donovan Mitchell's max contract kicks in next season? John Collins is gonna demand $25m/yr minimum."
"Free agency moves fast. Let's say a big is on your wishlist as a team, and you make a play for John Collins when Free Agency starts. Hawks have 3 days to match that, and that's 3 days you can't make a play for Lauri Markkanen, Jarrett Allen, Richaun Holmes, Serge Ibaka, PJ Tucker, Paul Milsap or Blake Griffin. That's not even considering the other free agents at other positions. You're probably the man out and have to settle with your 3rd, 4th option or worse if the Hawks match.   Hawks are in a position where they can afford to match max for John Collins and still extend Trae Young for max. Going after Collins is risky. Even if you're the Spurs or Thunder and you've got the cap to extend a max offer sheet, who's to say Collins would want to leave Atlanta where they just finished a rebuild, and go to a rebuilding team again for maybe $2m more a year?"
"Smaller wings, guards, yes. Dieng we aren't sure about but he was on the team too. Too soon to say. They might target John Collins with their max money."
"&gt; That's wrong. The Bucks literally, publicly, committed to offering supermax extension before they were allowed to do so. You can't offer a supermax to someone before their seventh year in the league is over, even if they're on your team.   I think it's disingenuous to use a situation where the Bucks got in trouble for tampering because they discussed, both publicly and behind closed doors with someone who was under contract, and on their team.    &gt; You can talk to people on your team. You just can't offer an official contract until free agency. Fournier is still under contract with the Celtics, so they can discuss rough numbers with his agent. They cannot formally offer him a deal yet, but they can know what he wants, and what he may be planning to do.   I was fairly sure that Evan Fournier was a free agent, which I could be wrong about. In any case, they can't begin formal negotiations until after free agency begins, which was what I was referring to, as the rough numbers you described would get you in trouble with tampering if made public. Obviously it happens, or we wouldn't get guys signing the opening moments of free agency. You can clearly see that this is against the rules because the bucks/kings got in trouble for this last year by prematurely discussing and announcing the Bogdan deal and trade, both of which were against the rules despite the fact that Bogdan was restricted. Though this is a bit different than extending a player who is under contract, those discussions are also not supposed to take place after the extension deadline, and before free agency begins. That's why the stuff you've probably heard is ""there is growing idea that John Collins will make a deal with the hawks"" before the season even ended because the hawks can't actually discuss this, but they clearly had these conversations anyway.   &gt; Edit: And you obviously can't offer sketchy wink-wink deals even if they're on your team e.g. like 'sign a 1+1 for cheap, then decline your second year, and we guarantee we'll max you.'    Yeah just ask the Wolves, they got multiple FRPs taken away due to this, but it also obviously still happens.       To be clear, I'm again speaking about what the rules says is supposed to happen, I can't actually speak to what really happens because I'm not a FO guy or an agent. I'm just a very devoted fan of the nba.     Before I have to go and find the sections of the rules to source my points, here is a high profile NBA reporter saying pretty much the exact same thing as me about Fournier    https://twitter.com/johnhollinger/status/1421263835495813127?s=19"
"I think you're being bit hard on our guy. To be fair he put up almost 19/9 in his sophomore year and this year he put up 19/6 on 50/40 efficiency pre all-star break in the few games he played and even under Boylend he managed to improve his defence plus the best playmaker hes played with is Kris Dunn, so i really think that if Lauri played next to Trae Young he would be better offensively then John Collins.  In my humble opinion if Lauri finds himself in good system that fits him and BIG IF he manages to stay healthy the hole season there is a real possibility that he becomes the MIP."
"You can really tell that people didn't watch us until the playoffs. 'Omg John Collins so underrated, Trae a star now!'. Dunn did fuck all for us, we just traded peanuts for some rebounds. It's fine by me, especially when you remember some of the big men we have had on the roster in the last few years"
Masai can make magic with mid-round picks. As long as the main asset (John Collins for example) is a solid young player then I think it‚Äôs worth it if they want to go in   another direcrion.
John Collins gone
Give me John Collins or give me death
"Player needs to be better than Rui. Thinking someone more in the realm of like Tyrese Haliburton, RJ Barrett or John Collins."
**He‚Äôs exactly Mark Jackson 2.0**  - Looks like a nice guy community wise but a bad coach at first  - Created friction between his players(Trae and John) where there was none  - Belittled and bullies Cam Reddish  - Calling John Collins selfish - Telling other coaches to not vote for Trae   He actively held the team back because he was a bad coach plus he created problems when there were none
"&gt;I see no reason to worry about paying 10M/year for 2 years to a backup 5.  If they are going to do something like max John Collins then that cap space will start dwindling real fast. Whether its JC or some other player, point is in the FA market you pay good not great players $20-30 mil $50 mil wont look like much very long. And if you have $50 mil in cap space you should be looking to get more than Lauri Markkanen caliber players.   $10 mil vs minimum level contracts always matters when you are trying to build up your talent base. It's not worth freaking out about but it's also just not good business."
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
"It's more to see who is tradable between him, Cam Reddish, oneyka Okungwu, maybe DeAndre Hunter idk.   It may also help them trade away Gallinari in a year or two. Maybe trade away Clint Capela.   To be honest the only guy who is worth the Max is Trae. John Collins is really good but I'm not sure about Max. While Kevin Heurter had a great playoff run he's not Max either. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish haven't shown themes to top players yet. Well maybe Hunter, but not Cam. Cams been too injured so we've only seen flashes.   We don't know anything about Oneyka Okungwu yet. So it gives options"
"Better than John Collins, Trae, Deandre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, and the potential of Reddish, Okongwu, Jalen Johnson and Cooper?"
John Collins please
"John Collins, Al Faroq Aminu"
That's literally John Collins 2.0 lol. Maybe they're not confident in keeping him? Interesting pick. Definitely worth the gamble regardless at this stage.
Pritchard should've been put out to pasture when he took Leaf over John Collins. He's way past his GM peak
Only way this pick makes sense is if they trade down or they‚Äôre planning on using the cap space on Jarret Allen or John Collins
"Only thing I can possibly think of is they wanna sign back John Collins, so in rider to keep him in the starting 5 they need to get rid of someone, so they would have trae bogdanovic hunter Collins Capela instead of reddish, but idk bout that"
"Lol sorry, we talk about him so much on our sub this year with the trade rumors and FA status that he isn‚Äôt good enough for us to repeatedly type out John Collins"
John Collins isn't nearly good enough to have one of those stupid acronyms.
"First thing, first overall pick will average closer to $11 million a year, not 5. Second, you're again taking the could over the is and if your is just turned 23 years old, it's not a brainer who to take. Third, if you're rebuilding why does it matter if you have a bunch of cap space tied up in pieces your building with? The cap stuff keeps getting brought up but it's a non-factor. They're not trying to sign free agents, they're trying to develop what they have. If you think SGA is worth a max (he is) then there's nothing wrong with paying him it. As long as SGA is fine with 2-3 of the years focused on developing (not tanking) then you give him that deal and don't think twice about it. If they went out and signed John Collins to a max then you have a point, but that's not the case."
Only would want John Collins honestly
"I was curious, so I looked up how many teams have been able to draft an all-star outside the top ten picks of the draft since 2013. Here's the complete list.  Denver - Jokic and potentially MPJ  LAC - SGA  Miami - Bam and maybe Herro  Milwaukie - Giannis  Minnesota - Zach Lavine  OKC - Sabonis  Phoenix - Booker  Toronto - Siakam  Utah - Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert  Honorable mentions  Atlanta - No but John Collins is close  Kings - Potentially Haliburton in the future  That's an average of a little more than one all-star per year. Again, I'm intending to defend Neil Olshey here, but so many blazers fans have it in their head that we were ""just a good pick"" away from contending, as though any team is able to consistently find all-stars at the back half of the draft."
Duarte is older than John Collins.

Every time I think John Collins is overrated he reminds me
"Tried to copy the formatting for the John Collins dunk vid, but don't see the streamable player on reddit.  What'd i screw up?"
"I agree with you. Will Ayton become a max player at some point in his career? Probably. Is he a max player right now, even after his playoffs run last season? Not really. The same happened with John Collins (who has proven more than Ayton) and nobody gave a fuck."
"John Collins is Overatted , but when he dunks...... it's always a highlight"
We got another John Collins in training too. Jalen Johnson will be annihilating rims soon as well
John Collins really just said Jarrett Allen's seasons is already done.
"Even the Cavs bench knew what‚Äôs UP. Freakin hell, John Collins."
"John Collins just submitted his adoption papers for Jarrett Allen, congrats to Allen for finding a forever home ü•∫"
It was a decent pass because John Collins was the only one who could get it up that high
That‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶. Y‚Äôall saw what John Collins just did????
  PG: James Harden   SG: Norman Powell  SF: Royce O‚ÄôNeal    PF: John Collins  C: Nerlens Noel
"&gt; John Collins and Capela worked, why not Allen and Mobley?  Collins is a firmly above average 3 point shooting big, while Mobley is probably not gonna be remotely productive as a shooter this year.  Collins also did sacrifice offense to fit with Capela, it was just worth it anyway."
"John Collins and Capela worked, why not Allen and Mobley? Like you said, they couldnt really let Allen go so you gotta see if it'll work.   All your concerns about him not having an outside shot yet or having to guard perimeter guys more are just more opportunities for him to practice and use it in game with Allen in the middle. And these are big reasons why he got drafted so high, because he has potential in those areas. You want him to have experience doing these things, so give him opportunities to do it. Unless you think playing with Allen will make it so tough for him that he'll shit the bed and lose confidence (which I dont believe so) then let him get opportunities. And they can always stagger them after the start of the game to give him chances to play as the only center."
I heard he's also beefing with John Collins
Yes they were lol.  Trae had the second most career games played of their starting five.  John Collins had the most.  They were significantly worse than both the rosters you just said.
"Suns are hoping they can haggle like hawks did with John Collins.  He‚Äôs worth more however, just give him the max and haggle with bridges"
"If fucking Michael Porter and John Collins got max contracts, Deandre Ayton deserves one"
"Honestly I think the Suns are being smart.  The John Collins negotiation showed you really don't _have_ to max these borderline guys, you just have to be willing to actually use the RFA rights.  The major downside risk for the team is that the guy goes out and signs a 3+1 max with a trade kicker instead of a 5 year max.  But if you're not that excited about maxing the guy anyway, might as well get out of it a year earlier. In the case of the Suns especially, their realistic chances are tied to CP3, so those two years on the end really aren't doing much (this is different from the MPJ negotiation where Jokic and Jamal could in theory still be good)  And it might turn out (as with Collins) that there is no cap-space team willing to sit around and wait for the Suns to decide whether or not to match, and no over-the-cap team willing to put assets into a sign-and-trade for the right to max him.  Like, we don't really think Ayton is a max guy, and honestly the Thunder probably don't either. So make him find an offer sheet if he thinks he is."
This was the same discourse that was around John Collins after year two
&gt;  A rookie max extension is given to basically anyone with all-star potential nowadays.  I think the John Collins and Jarrett Allen deals gives the Suns some leverage. High level shot creators get paid.  But a lot of other guys on the level of Jaylen Brown and Domantas Sabonis did not get maxed.
"It is for shot creators, but Ayton's number may be pegged differently based on what John Collins and Jarrett Allen just got.   Allen got $20, Collins got around $25.  Ayton is worth more than those guys, but not by a lot. They probably want to give him a near max number but not tie him to % of cap."
"I think a lot of that was due to Luke Walton trying to save his job. Another reason is due to personell. Like John Collins, I think Bagley is ultimately can be a stretch 4 or small ball 5 but unlike Atlanta the Kings are pretty flimsy at that 3/4 position. Outside of Harrison Barnes it's Metu and Harkless? Not great. So Bagley has to play the 4."
"First - Its probably gotta be a forward that can potentially play as a C right that's bad enough? Since i don't think there are any straight C's who are going to be better than Embiid, and no pg/sg/sf combos that's going to be better than the best starting back courts.   If we look at lineups:  BKN has  Kyrie, Harden, Harris, KD, Blake  (Presumably we'd target Blake here as the replacement - maybe Harris)  DEN's got JM, WBarton, MPJ, AG, Jokic (We'd target Barton/AG?)  GSW: Curry, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Wiseman (Target Wiggins / Wiseman)   So basically I'm thinking you need someone like John Collins / Jaren Jackson / Sabonis level who can slot in at C, and/or potentially play SF/PF or allow your current PF to move to SF/C  So my guess is: Jaren Jackson jr"
"I remember [this](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/John-Collins-dunk-Joel-Embiid.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all) ending up on TNT, Joel"
"John Collins is our emotional support player. He‚Äôs there to talk shit when we need it, or to de-escalate tensions between the refs and Trae.   Or to have a spongebob ringtone go off in a post game presser"
"John Collins can't match Embiid in All-Star appearances, but I'll take John Collins In Shit-talking against anybody in the league.   He will dunk on you and put it on a T-shirt. This is not a metaphor. He's our Randy Marsh and he will instigate no matter who's on the other side."
"True I completely understand. John Collins has improved on getting his own shots. He‚Äôs limited but he has a very good mid post jumper and righty hook. That‚Äôs the knock on Collins offensive game, considering how much we‚Äôre paying him, he has a couple of go to moves but you can‚Äôt toss him the ball and tell him to get you 30. He‚Äôs an elite finisher all over the court and that‚Äôs where his value lies.  Capela‚Äôs number is only 70% because he gets so many offensive rebounds. Otherwise that number would be somewhere in the 90 percentile.  But KP will probably play better this year."
"Well you did start this whole exchange degenerating into an insult flinging rage after two comments disagreeing with you about Trae Young, so I‚Äôd say that youve been on that path for some time. Drive times over though so this is officially no longer a fun time waster, so I‚Äôll just reiterate that John Collins annihilated your favorite and put it on autographed t shirts :) have a pleasant day"
You got it. He also said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget to mention that John Collins put his favorite player on a tshirt‚Äù
"I don‚Äôt know, but I do know that John Collins put your fav on a tshirt"
He said ‚ÄúJohn Collins put your fav on a tshirt‚Äù
Let me spell it out for you. John Collins put your favorite player on a tshirt.
"Ok. let me spell this out for you.   Nobody other than John Collins and apparently you thought that was a tough move. Embiid made the right play, got temporarily embarrassed and went on with his life. That was the highlight of Collins' career (and apparently your life), I doubt Embiid has ever thought about it since. I only remember it because you keep bringing it up.  I genuinely don't care, it was a good play, that's it. Unlike you I don't rely on other men to preserve my masculinity."
That‚Äôs why John Collins put your favorite player on a tshirt pussy.
The joke got tired. But you know what isn‚Äôt tired? John Collins putting your soft ass favorite player on a tshirt pussy
That‚Äôs why John Collins put your favorite player on a tshirt pussy
I‚Äôm gonna specifically not read that so you know how much of a time waster it was to type.   That‚Äôs why John Collins put your favorite player on a T-shirt pussy
"I remember a time early last season where a lot of people thought John Collins was worth a max,  so glad Atlanta kept him at a better price"
If you‚Äôre talking John Collins then it‚Äôs sita bad for because John is just not a 5 and isn‚Äôt very good defensively there. Doubt we play small ball all the time either.   In also just not sure on the offensive end either. We do a lot of PnR and John and Trae are great together in that so where does Ben go in this scenario. Does he become the roll man and Collins spots in the corner?  Suppose it could work but not sure it‚Äôs a good use of players as John is way more efficient and a better scorer than Ben
Well the bucks had two other stars to carry some weight. Nobody‚Äôs gonna create their own shot consistently on the hawks except for Trae. Not even john Collins.  That‚Äôs why the bucks should‚Äôve handled the hawks easily with everyone being healthy. They‚Äôre a much better team on paper. But Trae was a problem
"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer‚Äôs newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons‚Äô availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly ‚Äî and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season‚Äôs $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  ¬ª READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons‚Äô absence: It‚Äôs ‚Äòborderline kind of disrespectful‚Äô  The Sixers‚Äô position that they‚Äôre not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They‚Äôre trying to win a championship, and believe they‚Äôre in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who‚Äôs in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren‚Äôt as blindsided by Simmons‚Äô desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons‚Äô trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons‚Äô camp don‚Äôt believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they‚Äôre just determined to do it on their terms.

Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta.YONG KIM / Staff Photographer Destined for a messy divorce  Publicly, the Sixers talk about wanting Simmons to return and be part of a championship team in Philly. The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has ‚Äúrun its course.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThey know that,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been known that. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He‚Äôs going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.‚Äù Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can‚Äôt blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can‚Äôt blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt negate that the relationship is done,‚Äù another source said. ‚ÄúThis is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That‚Äôs what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it‚Äôs not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.‚Äù  ¬ª READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers‚Äô starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers‚Äô tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons‚Äô skills was more lovely, it‚Äôs hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers‚Äô lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly‚Äôs steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn‚Äôt honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  ‚ÄúThis entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It‚Äôs not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs never been smooth at all.‚Äù  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player‚Äôs former team got worse. That‚Äôs something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid‚Äôs squad, not Simmons‚Äô team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team‚Äôs go-to player.  ‚ÄúWhat No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?‚Äù said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just [speaking] facts. But because he‚Äôs Australian, because he‚Äôs a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.‚Äù"
That‚Äôs why John Collins put your fav on a T-shirt dork
"I know he sent you guys home man but you don‚Äôt have to be so bitter about it. I‚Äôd be mad too if John Collins was selling autographed t shirts of him posting the ever loving fuck out of my favorite player too, so I understand your pain."
John Collins? Gallo?
It should've been John Collins imo.
"I think it makes sense for the Cavs to wait until next year on Sexton, unless they can get him for a below market deal.  Jaren... who knows what Memphis is thinking. I think he will wind up with a deal closer to what John Collins got from ATL."
Cleveland has reported to been shopping him and Jackson has big injury issues.  John Collins and Jarrett Allen didn‚Äôt get maxes.  Mikal bridges won‚Äôt get the max either
Trae and John Collins  Mitchell and Gobert  Luka and Porz-never mind  Now Tatum and Brown
"&gt;*ahem*, John Collins  No sir quite the contrary"
"I mean I'd say John Collins is a comparable player and he's getting paid like 60% of what MPJ is over the next 5 years, plus he doesn't have anywhere near the same injury concerns."
"Morey gonna need Trae Young, 4 firsts and John Collins as a minimum. Simmons has way more all star appearances and ‚Äúalmost DPOYs‚Äù than Trae does, y‚Äôall gonna have to try and impress to compete with all the other interest Simmons is generating."
"We (feels weird to say we with this flair) don't really have anyone else that can fill Capela's shoes on the interior - John Collins is not a good defender, Simmons would be a perimeter defender. And when you have Trae on the perimeter it's absolutely crucial to have elite perimeter defense."
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"I was happy when I saw John Collins over Leaf, but then got really disappointed"
"Also Capela, Bogdanovic, Gallinari, John Collins, and Dominque Wilkins"
"Yeah I agree in a sense; it‚Äôs kinda similar but John Collins‚Äô skills aren‚Äôt exactly as coveted as MPJ‚Äôs. He shot 42.2% from 3 last year and 44.5% from 3 this season, a 6‚Äô10‚Äù wing and athletic. He‚Äôs got way more upside than John Collins who‚Äôs a 4 that kinda can play 5 against smaller 5‚Äôs but not really. They both benefit immensely from the shot creation of their primary playmakers in Jokic and Trae but MPJ is a player any team would want, Collins not really since his defense is average to below average for his role where defense is very important.  I think they just wanted to lock him down and ensure that they have their 4 locked in - Murray, MPJ, Gordon, Jokic is an excellent core and knowing that those 4 are all on similar timelines makes things easier moving forward."
"fair but then John Collins is another example. He likely wanted a max extension last summer, and some would (and did) argue they had to pay him or trade him, but another year gave them a better valuation of his talents and got a slightly better deal. MPJ has played one season as a starter and if you're not getting a cheap deal for him, I'd wait out the year and see if he's actually worth it. He might be worth it and you can give him the max later, but you might see him plateau and be able to get him for cheaper. And worst case, if someone else still maxes him, you can just match him"
You don't believe John Collins?  Maybe he meant they didnt have any meaningful conversations with other teams in free agency.  The Hawks could had just matched.  What team wants to engage another team in that game?
"I don't mind the players requesting/demanding a trade. Fuck, man. Even though we're living at time with robots like Brady and LeBron, those two are still outliers. A player's career is very short compared to most career choices and their time on top is even smaller.  I think abolishing the salary cap but still keeping a hard cap would solve a lot of such issues. Then you get paid on your *true* value. Not the current system where a player like Simmons or John Collins get megadeals that eat up a team's flexibility while also paying them way above what the actual market would call for."
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
"We did run too many bench players at one time IMO, but they still weren‚Äôt getting beat by the opposing starters. Go look at the box scores in the Atlanta series, mainly games 1 and 5. Our bench had an awful +/-, Atlanta‚Äôs bench had a phenomenal +/-. Our bench wasn‚Äôt getting beat by guys like Trae and John Collins, it was guys like Solomon Hill, Gallo, LouWill, and Okungwu. And those two games were a 3 point loss and a 4 point loss. If our bench just plays mildly bad in those games instead of straight up atrocious we win the series in five."
"Maybe I'm a boomer but I think Kyrie Irving should be above Trae.   Also it's weird because Kyrie is a point and Harden is a shooting guard, but on the Nets they play reversed.  I also take John Collins over Julius Randle, but again maybe I'm just stupid."
"So did you watch the eastern conference playoffs? Our second best player was some combo of john collins, hurt bogdan, or fucking Gallo. Trae is a generational offensive player just like paul or nash before him. You don't need to be 6'7 to be generational offensive talent"
John Collins will change his name to Jon Collins.
"He literally is switchable lmao.  He guarded everyone from Bam, Blake, John Collins, Clint, Gallo &amp; Ayton to guards.  You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the finals run."
Yeah I forgot about Amaechi. A joint episode on him and John Collins will be very insightful.
John Amaechi can be added to the Collins one to beef up the run time simply because the homophobia towards Amaechi was more public and toxic and can also be contrasted with how the response to Collins differed.
"Net rating in small sample sizes like 7 or so games is an inherently flawed stat but I‚Äôm not gonna go into that.  The point is that if your primary ball handler can‚Äôt even TRY to touch the ball in the fourth quarter and is an inherent liability on offense that is a MASSIVE problem.  Nobody‚Äôs expecting him to suddenly shoot well, but the problem isn‚Äôt shooting well it‚Äôs not taking the shot at all.  It‚Äôs not even just shooting on offense even off ball he just got to a spot and STOOD there. Not trying to get open and John Collins boxed him out with ONE FUCKING HAND.   Players like shaq and Giannis are awful free throw shooters but that doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt attack the basket or even try to take open shots."
"People seriously underrated the 2020-2021 Hawks team. I would argue it was better than the 2018-2019 Celtics easily, and maybe slightly better than 2017-2018 Celtics, or as good. John Collins, Capela, multiple backup playmaking guards, good wing defenders, guys that could create their own shot. He carried them in a way that is standard for all-nba talents."
"Yeah but he‚Äôs one of your star, max players. Here are his shooting numbers in the 4th quarter. Now how should people react when one of your top players takes 3 shots combined in 7 4th quarters.   Game 1: 2-2 Game 2: 0-0 Game 3: 1-1 Game 4: 0-0 Game 5: 0-0 Game 6: 0-0 Game 7: 0-0  And here are his free throw percentages for each game:  Game 1: 30% Game 2: 0% Game 3: 50% Game 4: 20% Game 5: 29% Game 6: 50% Game 7: 50%  (33% for the series)   Averaged 9.9 pts for the series.   Supposed to be one of the top defenders in the league and Trae Young, John Collins, Huerter and Bogdanovic took turns abusing him (and the rest of the team).   With all that said, he wasn‚Äôt the only problem. But to your questions ‚Äúdid he play bad‚Äù, yes. Yes he did. Very bad.  And I don‚Äôt even want him to shoot jump shots. Just make free throws and score 14pts along everything else he already does."
Not big on the Hawks but I like John Collins
I cannot BELIEVE he dunked that. What a fucking pass too. Love me some John Collins.
John Collins is my best friend.
well shit John Collins ok then
Holy shit John Collins almost touched the roof there
JOHN COLLINS OMG
John Collins is gonna be the key in this series
BRO THAT JOHN COLLINS DUNK
John Collins just jumped 35 feet
THANK YOU SWEET HESUS LETS GO JOHN COLLINS
JOHN COLLINS WITH NO REGARD FOR JUMAN LIFE
OH MY GOD JOHN COLLINS
#JOHN COLLINS
LETS GOOO JOHN COLLINS
Capela has been unreal on Atlanta. Gallinari can shoot and attack close outs. Bogdan can hit shots and create his own. Hunter is just like Covington. John Collins is a floor spacing lob Threat. Who else does Portland have other than those guys you mentioned? Atlanta‚Äôs bench is decent too. Portland is top heavy and you know it too.
john collins being completely wasted.. hope he goes to a new team
John collins should get paid by the  US Navy for the amount of mentions he gets them per game at this point
Whoever giving John Collins that max contract gonna be in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride
Clint capella and John Collins really compliment each other well with their skillsets
John Collins really hates playing defense huh?
John Collins is so bad at rebounding
HHH guest referee hits pedigree on Trae young and hits John collins with a sledge hammer.
"Harden didn't have Bogi or Hunter or John Collins.  If you really paid attention, the score went wide open with Trae on the bench."
I‚Äôm going to laugh if someone pays John Collins $125 million this summer. I can‚Äôt even tell when he‚Äôs in the game.
John Collins needs to know his limits. He gets stripped every time he puts the ball on the floor
I'd like one John Collins please.
John Collins looks like he's too scared for the big stage.
"The hawks are great don‚Äôt get me wrong, they‚Äôre crazy deep I‚Äôm just saying John Collins would be the fourth best sixer."
"The Hawks are 100% win now. Trae Young is playing well enough to contend on a rookie contract. Now is one of the best times to try and win before Trae is on a supermax. Trae, DeAndre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, John Collins, these guys are all on a huge discount which has allowed for an Atlanta team that is stupid deep. You‚Äôre going to be very surprised how well they handle Philly, if Embiid never makes it back healthy Atlanta will be in the ECF"
"1. Yes pretty much  2. Pick two of John Collins, Clint Capela, or Gallinari. Gallinari is pretty much the only other shot creator for the team."
"Probably John Collins, since I think they both play PF"
I saw a dude put Jeremi Grant and John Collins ahead of PG
"I can't believe Embiid hasn't been thrown from a game this series. Pushing Gallinari for standing up while he was trying to step over him, tackling John Collins in the knees, and then the elbow to Collins face, followed by escalating the situation with walking him back 15 feet. Oh, but he had his hands out! It's still an act of aggression. Fuck that dude, I've lost all respect for him in the last 6 games. Refs are protecting him and letting him get away with everything."
"Embiid literally got a call after shoving John Collins, grabbing a rebound and falling down with NO contact at a crucial point in game 5. Jesus you guys need to get a grip on reality"
"Rest of the leagues fans against embiids constant flopping, complaining and attempts to injure John Collins"
Fuck embiitch. Dirty ass player tried twice now to hurt John collins
"Bro john collins went straight up, and Embiid backed into his space not allowing him to land cleanly. The arm was a pretty natural motion, and I know you‚Äôll exaggerate and say ‚Äúhe choked him out‚Äù but you are just wrong"
John collins has drawn a bunch of fouls on our bigs by being shorter and puting his face by our guys elbows.
"It‚Äôs not just that they didn‚Äôt call his flopping It‚Äôs that they didn‚Äôt call anything, like John Collins put him in a headlock and it was a foul on Embiid, Capela absolutely mauled him in the paint a few times and there was no whistle when Trae was getting a whistle for having someone breathe on him"
"Imagine being like 7 feet tall, almost 300 pounds, and complaining about the refs all the time. Same guy who was fouling other guys with no calls and saying ‚ÄúITS THE PLAYOFFS!‚Äù Joel Embiid is straight up made out of cookie dough. Dude also blatantly dove at John Collins‚Äô knee with absolutely no consequences. Fuck this guy."
BAH GAWD IS THAT JOHN COLLINS MUSIC!!!!
"John ""$100 million man"" Collins with 7 points in 37 minutes. Averaging just shy of 15 ppg over the playoffs."
I don't think anyone besides John Collins thinks he's worth the max. That contract should be reserved for all star caliber players at LEAST
"It's so infuriating lol. If you check the game 5 highlights you'll see there's a play where he catches the ball in the lane, he's open, HE HAS A DUNK, but he doesn't even look at the basket and passes it out to Embiid for a three.  But then, same game, literally 2 clips later he's dunking in John Collins' face and acting like a big strong man. So which is it?"
He was obviously trying to bait John Collins without hitting him.
Yes trae young forced giant ass embiid to walk 20 steps into John collins
That‚Äôs funny because John Collins hit Embiid neck/face on that poster dunk and it was called a foul on Embiid. The reffing was clearly inconsistent and favored the hawks this game.
Lol how is it one sided if we barely shot any more free throws. 8 of our attempts came from the sixers intentionally fouling our big men to stop dunks and send poor shooters to the line.  Both teams shot pretty much the same amount of 3s. You don't think I thought that John Collins should have gone to the line more than 3 times? But they weren't calling that on either team tonight.
"Ok hear me out. Trade Harris and picks for cj, and move Ben to PF. Maxey moves to starting pg. Trade hill or whatever and find a small forward who can shoot or sign Danny green again to play decent defense and hang out for corner threes.   Ben in the post with a real guard out there is fine, then he can be a rim runner as well like a John Collins who can pass. Sixers don‚Äôt have that bc we don‚Äôt really want embiid flying around bc he‚Äôs fragile. Ben can also pass out of the post. Maxey can run point and can make his own bucket if needed and he has shown that he can throw lobs. Cj is the scoring guard who can pull up. And gives embiid space when he needs it. Ben plays more as a cutter rather than standing in the dunker spot all game  You could also change cj for just about any other good guard.   I just don‚Äôt think that Ben is as tradable, and Tobias is a little soft in the paint, we could really use a guy on the starting line up to catch lobs. I think we would need to set screens for him though. Like imagine how cool it would be to have him running off a screen down low on the left while there‚Äôs a maxey pick and pop high on the right. Maxey drives center and shoots, lobs or kicks.  I don‚Äôt think losing the 20 Harris gets us will be that bad bc our bench will be better with Seth on it, not to mention I think in a scoring rim running role Ben gets you 15-20. Im pretty sick of Ben, but I think this is a better move than trading Ben for someone unless you get a much better value for Ben which I don‚Äôt know that you do. He‚Äôs younger and has more potential, but not a lotta teams will be looking for his unique set of skills  I also don‚Äôt dislike Harris, but if maxey starts, we have two pfs and neither Ben or Harris can play sf"
"I know what you‚Äôre trying to say here, and you‚Äôre right, but John Collins is 6‚Äô 9‚Äù so he probably weighs about 100lbs more than you think he does. Obviously Embiid is bigger than everyone else, but  Collins is 140? Nah."
"Earlier this playoffs I thought Bogdan might've been one of those dogs, but apparently not (and despite the epic poster, not John Collins either)"
I want to be John Collins üò≠üò≠üò≠
he fell on top of him and then john collins shoved him
"Bro Embiid doesn't even know where John Collins is, that's why he got dunked on. He's just trying to play the lob. Dangerously back into an airborne player? fuck outta here."
"He was trying to breast feed John Collins, thereby insinuating John Collins is a little baby"
"In the Moment, how are the refs supposed to do literally anything to stop an angry Joel Embiid from making John Collins his bitch if he wants to?"
John Collins wants a max contract and didn't show up for a decisive game in the playoffs. He needs to be replaced
"Hawks can cry about the refs, but they lost because John Collins played like a bum"
"It is so obvious that the league has a financial interest in this series going 7. The refereeing has been so incredibly biased towards the 6ers as to be laughable. At least 5 uncalled travels, countless uncalled fouls, Embiid allowed to charge John Collins and all that results is a double tech. It‚Äôs indefensible"
Didn‚Äôt even notice John Collins has done absolutely nothing today
How long you plan on being offended on behalf of John Collins for?
In a few years Embiid is going to tell people he killed John Collins in a fight as a 6 year old
Offensive foul but John collins can do a chokehold when dunking lol
John collins gets elbowed in the face hard as shit on the shot attempt
took an elbow to the face then had the dude lay on him like a big baby. get embiid out of here. also #20 is the baptizer John Collins for future reference
I don‚Äôt think John Collins is that fucking strong lmao
John Collins isn‚Äôt small yo. Embiid made dude look like a toddler walking him down like that
Flagrant 4 on embiid flagrant 2 on John Collins   2 ft‚Äôs for Ben Simmons   1 wide open penalty 3 point shot for Danny green  2fts for trae young
Embiid mad about the john collins poster
john collins sucks lmao
John Collins with the 400 IQ getting Embiid into a fight
Embiid just act fucking normal.   4 more minutes of owning the atlanta hawks franchise and you get game 7 at home.  Literally no need to pick a fight with a complete bum in John Collins.
As John Collins is literally out here trying to kill people twice
Lol John Collins doesn‚Äôt want to see embiid at all
John Collins pushes first Joel holds his hands up and Trae pushes him in the back but the chuds in this thread will say it‚Äôs all Embiid‚Äôs fault
That‚Äôs all john Collins
JOHN COLLINS IS GRABBING EMBIID AFTER. Fuck off Hubie Brown
John Collins is a fucking PUSSY lmao
Why is John Collins allowed to do literally whatever he wants? He‚Äôs out here killing people man.
John Collins has so much potential but either his ego or lack of PED has hindered his development
John Collins playing like a guy whos ready for his next team.
John Collins is a max player. r/s
John Collins gonna be signing the MLE next summer
John Collins seeing that max contract fade away
John Collins wants the max lolll
"finally a highlight with the slow mo replay, even the john collins dunk has it cut out"
Doc you have Tobias in there against John Collins. Obviously he‚Äôs gonna get out rebounded what you bitching about?
John Collins is so good
John Collins can‚Äôt be trying to ask for 20 million a year after scoring 5 points in an elimination game.
But John Collins can put embiid in a headlock fuck outta here rigged ass game
"John ""The Baptizer"" Collins"
fuck john collins
John ‚ÄúSteve Austin‚Äù Collins
Maybe but John Collins wouldn‚Äôt have cried about it
"John ""The Baptizer"" Collins"
John Collins literally caught Embiid's body lmao
"Great play by John Collins, but that is a fucking offensive foul if I've ever seen one and Doc needs to fucking challenge it."
"""John Collins is my best friend"""
This is the yammed on version of you got mossed.  John ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me JC‚Äù Collins whatta fuckin play
JOHN COLLINS YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD
holy fuck john collins jumped through the roof
John Collins has made up probably 70% of my postseason stank faces
Fuck you John Collins. Asshole.
YO JOHN COLLINS WHAT
MY GOD JOHN COLLINS
RKO by John Collins
John Collins decides to play basketball and immediately becomes the undertaker
"John Collins saw Simmons get a max contract by being absolutely mediocre and said ""Why not me?"""
John Collins needs to start hitting literally any shots. Brick city right now from him
Lol John Collins wants how much???
john collins needs to help his team somehow
John Collins has zero BBIQ   He seems lost whenever he touches the ball
"John Collins is gonna get 4/120 from someone, and it‚Äôll be Chandler Parsons bad"
John Collins is goofy as hell
Does John Collins ever make shots?
John Collins Blows... Got Poor Man Ben Simmons Vibes
Bro if Simmons had Trae he'd feast. Sixers don't need to get rid of Simmons they just need a legit point guard that can let Ben alley oop all game ala John Collins.
The Hawks have a bright future. I really hope they don't fuck it up by giving John Collins a max deal.
"&gt;As bad as the Mavs are, it's not like the Hawks are a juggernaut either  Hawks have John Collins, Capela, Bogdan, Gallo, Kevin Huerter, and etc. This Hawks team is stacked and meanwhile Luka has THJ and KP (who is horrible) and he still took the clippers to 7 games."
"I was around for the OG Highlight Factory Hawks days with both of the Joshs. They were always good for a few SC Top 10 plays a night.   But this iteration of the Hawks is so much more fun. It helps that they went back to a more retro look, but it's been a joy to watch Trae Young and John Collins this postseason.   It makes me hate that they're in my division."
Joel Embiid literally just almost destroyed John Collins knees last game with his flopping. Pls stop.
John Collins needs to stop attempting to end his own career
John Collins looks like evil genius face. Linke mandark
Fun fact. Trae and John Collins have never lost an NBA elimination playoff game.
I‚Äôm not moving him for Ben.  It‚Äôs for Tobi   Tobi can get his own shot against mismatches.  But so far he‚Äôs struggled when we needed him to get anything vs John Collins late in games.  Also I‚Äôm assuming we get Lowry in this scenario.    Lowry CJ Curry Ben and Embiid
"You mean exactly what he did? Intentionally tried to injure John Collins, and when it didn't work he goes for the nuts, and when he cant get them he arm bars his ankle and rolls his weight on to it. Fuck Joel EmFlop - I never realized what a fucking punk bitch he was until these playoffs"
"People confuse %s on open looks ‚Äî when defenders want you to shoot ‚Äî vs contested by a defender or double teamed. It‚Äôs why John Collins doesn‚Äôt shoot a lot of 3s even though he hovers around 40% from 3pt, why Blake achieved league average midrange fg%. Defenders let these players shoot during regular season. In the playoffs, defenders don‚Äôt."
"They have. Trae Young is shooting .419/.317 this series, well below his career averages.   The issue is the secondary players. Not many people have talked about how excellent John Collins has been this series - A spark plug on both ends while averaging 17 PPG on .557/.500"
"In the Philly series, Tatum averaged 24/3/3, Rozier averaged 19/7/4.   In the Cleveland series, Tatum averaged 18/4/2, Brown averaged 20/5/2.   In the Raptors series, Tatum averaged 24/10/5, Brown averaged 21/9/2.   In this Sixers series, Trae has averaged 30/2/11, his 2nd leading scorer is John Collins at 17/9/1."
why is there a whole website for john collins merch lol
Did y‚Äôall see Giannis in the background of the John Collins TNT interview shooting lol. The background was blurred but that shooting form is undeniable.
"Yes, let's continue to give no credit to the winning team but instead hate on the losers. John Collins played the game of his life on the boards, he pulled down so many tough ones. Watch basketball instead of just looking at numbers"
Imagine if KP was playing like John Collins smh
He called John Collins ‚ÄúClint capella‚Äù multiple times lmao
can we get john collins bird noise
I am really impressed with John Collins. I love his play and demeanor
John Collins is so cool
I am LOVING this hawks team after that John Collins interview
Trae played great but John Collins was HUGE. got a very important putback to stop the bleeding and then that clutch three. incredible
john collins seems like a cool mf honestly
John Collins interview was really good. Excited to watch him more
John Collins crushed that TNT interview
Anyone watch that john Collins post game interview? He was so damn likable jeez
John Collins charismatic af
People thought Trae and John Collins weren't a good fit earlier this season. Good to see them show everyone what's up
damn even John Collins making bird noises too
"John Collins is the complete package, he‚Äôs going to get that contract he‚Äôs been asking for"
John Collins just gave an incredible interview. Ernie was genuinely impressed.
John Collins does a *slightly* better Hawk Cry than Shaq does haha.
John Collins seems smart and generally awesome
John Collins sounds like Kobe. His voice *slightly* but mainly his cadence and inflection
John Collins seems like a good dude
"John ""I'm a freak athlete"" Collins"
Wow John Collins is such a pro
Wtf John Collins just skyrocketed up my favorite player rankings. What a great interview
"Inject more of this post game into me, can we get John Collins talking every night?"
John Collins showing Shaq how to caw lmao
Damn John Collins is a super likable dude
"John Collins has been absolutely huge for the Hawks, these past few games especially. He's always fighting for rebounds and has really good chemistry with Trae. Feels like he's always scoring in the flow of the game too and not taking shots away from the Hawks outside threats.  Also a reminder that the Hawks got Capela for what ended up being the 17 pick in last year's draft (and Evan Turner's expiring). Collins was the 19 pick himself. Incredible value"
John Collins seems like a stud
John Collins is a fuckin treasure
"John Collins is underrated, him and Trae gonna be a nice duo."
Shaq just dunking on John Collins lmao that was so back handed
I respect the Hawks because they play real team basketball with a centrepiece in Trae.   John Collins stock is up up.  And Nate McMillan looks like Nick Nurse 2.0.
"Hard to belive the hawks only had 5 more rebounds, felt like they were all over the glass. John fucking collins had 15 and capela had 19."
"Come on, you can't be serious, it's amazing Luka even gets 10 assists every night. Just think about it, his scoring options are Dorian finney-smith, Tim hardaway, Jr., Josh Richardson, boban and kristaps, all whom forgets how to shoot a ball every other night. Meanwhile, Trae has Bogdan, Danilo, John Collins, Kevin huerter and Clint capela. Can't compare the two, man."
John Collins is mad underrated
"Not a one man carry, crazy deep team. John Collins and Clint Capela combined for 9 offensive rebounds"
"Yeah, I like John Collins. Great PF."
Nah. Luka plays in the West.  While Trae doesn‚Äôt necessarily have superstars playing with him John Collins and Co are far better teammates than Lukas.  It was like Luka&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Trae and now maybe Luka&gt;&gt;Trae.
John Collins loves playing with Trae so much man and I'm SURE it's reciprocated   the smile  the hop  the head taps
I know it's Trae's team and he's the star but that John Collins Capela frontcourt is scary solid
Bud about to be the first coach let go mid playoffs series.   Also I‚Äôm glad John collins is doing good. He was a monster then dropped off
"Me and my friends nicknamed him John ""fucking"" Collins this game and were yelling it every time he made massive rebounds. I fucking love it."
john collins just outrebounded giannis in milwaukee
Obviously Trae had a great game but John Collins consistently playing like that will go a long way with improving the ceiling of this team
John collins was the unsung hero of this game. While the rest of the hawks were bricking bad 3s the mast few mins his hustle giving them 2nd chance opportunities and getting easy 2s won them this game in the end
I mean they have John Collins so obviously they are going to be good lol
john collins is getting paid
Is there a John Collins fan group? I‚Äôd like to officially join
John Collins three pointer cant be understated how big of a shot it was
Giannis leaving John Collins open ruined out momentum
Wym without John Collins? He has a double double lol
John Collins is a bad man.  Anyone saying the Hawks shouldnt pay him need to rethink their stance.
2 things I know: Pump fake John Collins and Jrue &gt; Bledsoe.
John Collins is getting paaaaiiiddddddd
John Collins been playing out his mind
John collins is  so fucking good
John Collins to Hornets next year confirmed.
John Collins is a menace
I will say it again John Collins is getting PAIDDDD after this season
Trae gonna make one deep three that‚Äôll be all over the highlights even though he‚Äôd be shooting them out of the game without John Collins
John Collins is a beast
"I want a John Collins jersey, but I don't believe in repping teams I dont support"
John Collins doing it all rn
Every team needs a John Collins.  Such a solid player. I just love his attitude
"When he got drafted that was pretty much his niche a la John ""The Baptist"" Collins. I'm more impressed with the rest of his game"
What's do Hawks fans expect John Collins to do this FA?
 Never realized John Collins has hops like that till these playoffs üò≥
John Collins looks like he‚Äôs on a trampoline
John Collins getting the max?
"now they are saying it's john collins, clint capella isn't even on the floor"
where should we rank john collins in best pf/center in the nba right now? top 5? top 10?
So‚Ä¶..John Collins is getting the max right?
He called John Collins Clint Capela earlier too
Smart man that John Collins is knowing better than trying to post up Jrue Holiday
"John Collins turned down 90 mil cos he wants a bigger deal, well he‚Äôs about to get it with how well he‚Äôs  been playing!"
the next John Collins t shirt
Baptizing the city of Milwaukee  JOHN COLLINS
"Hawks fans, I know you guys don't really want to pay John Collins this summer, right?  ....  Right?  Asking for my friend MJ...."
John Collins is getting PAID after this season
John collins!!!!!
trae young + john collins = the best alley-oop connection in the playoffs
JOHN MOTHERFUCKING COLLINS
John Collins is part kangaroo
Why don't teams just put a Khris Middleton or Giannis on Trae Young and make John Collins or Bogdan beat you? Would Trae cook them? How have the Hawks made it this far?
"John Collins needs to stop bricking everything. The Hawks need to play a lot better defense. The shooters need to stop bricking. If not, this is an easy sweep for the Bucks while Trae has his big games."
John Collins shook on the gather when he saw Giannis  waiting for him in the paint.
"You could just stick bol bol in front of the rim, and have him block every single shot before it goes in. A lot of players can get above the rim too, like John Collins could easily block every shot if there was no goaltending."
"Not sure about their cap situation. Need to pay John Collins, Gallo is still making bank, Capela makes bank. If anything they will return the same roster with another year of experience for the guys like Reddish, Hunter, Huerter - which is huge as is."
"Wow John Collins doesn‚Äôt play defense, does he"
"Bogi one of our most powerful offensive weapons. With him so gimpy, we need John Collins to step up. Players like Solomon Hill and Tony Snell are just warm bodies for defense really. Heurter needs to carry a much bigger offensive load as well."
John Collins one of the players that changed my opinion on this playoffs  Dude works so hard on the glass and has turned into a damn good shooter   His free agency will be interesting
"I think John Collins would be ideal on Giannis. He's really good at staying in front. Did a helluva job on Embiid, as much as one can do imo."
"The matchups in this series are so thought provoking. Like, does Trae actually try to guard Jrue? Can John Collins hang with Giannis? Can Brook Lopez guard capella on the p&amp;r? Who guards huerter? Who sticks Middleton? WHAT THE FUCK?!?!"
Yep but Simmons does fill any needs for us. Just like Collins doesn‚Äôt fix any of your needs like a secondary creator or help with your rim defense. John is a solid defensive 4 and help defender but if you ask him to be your defensive 5 and rim protector you are going to have a bad time
Love isn't even 6'10 nor healthy  Randle? John Collins? Brook? KAT?
" That‚Äôs exactly why he won‚Äôt be on Lopez. What‚Äôs Lopez gonna do, back down John Collins or Okungwu? Lol"
"If Sam Hinkie had been running the Hawks this offseason, then not only does he not bring in Bogdan/Gallo, he flips Capela for a draft pick before he ever even suits up for Atlanta. Probably even trades John Collins too. The team loses 50 games again and Trae is already halfway out the door."
"I love these hawks and John Collins, I was a big fan of his while he was at wake forest and he has only grown since"
"It depends on context.   If you work at a factory, and the employees on the floor aren't allowed to use cocaine or heroin, and the management tests them for them, shouldn't EVERYBODY in the SAME COMPANY have to follow the SAME rules?   YES!!  If it is unacceptable for a player to use recreational drugs, then it is unacceptable for ANYBODY in the organization to use recreational drugs.   &amp;#x200B;  Performance enhancing drugs are a different story. In fact, the leagues are REDICULOUSLY strict rules about PEDs. Steroid? When I had plantar fasciitis, a dose of steroids cleared that shit right up, and any number of small injuries can be addressed in the same way. But NBA players aren't allowed such treatments. Over-the-counter supplements that are perfectly legal?  John Collins and Deandre Ayton got suspensions for using that stuff.   So for PEDs, no... those are unique to performance on the court, so owners and other employees shouldn't be held to the same standard.  &amp;#x200B;  But yes. If an owner says ""no cocaine"" then the owner doesn't get to snort a line in front of the player while taking a blood sample. That's just common sense."

"I would prefer it honestly.  Then you could really see who is the best ayers.  Bron gets 80 of the cap and surounded by bargain sbooters, but his team looks way different then say the hawks with like several 20 percent cap guys.  Would be way better for parity.  Also would stop super max traps like john collins.  I love jc but aint trae, lebron or luca type guy at all!"

I know John Collins wants a big payday and not sure if Atlanta would do that.  would Wiggins and (#7 or wiseman) work in a sign and trade?  I assume Wiggins has to in order to match salary so I figure its either the pick or wiseman...not both.  maybe another player with Collins too
Bobby portis is cooking John Collins man. And people want to max this man?
Bobby Portis is absolutely killing John Collins  KILLING
What‚Äôs up with John Collins
John Collins with the 0/0/0 line. Give this man the max!
Why are John Collins &amp; ayton in the league then? Genuine question
John Collins isn‚Äôt a max player  Hopefully the Hawks can reach an agreement that‚Äôs fair for both sides
"Hey hawks, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt give John Collins a big contract lmfao"
I really hope the Hawks pay John Collins 100 mil +
"If ever there was a game to demonstrate being worth ‚Äúthe bag‚Äù for John Collins, this would be it."
John Collins isn't getting a max.
Fun Fact kevin huerter and John Collins lead hawks have never lost a game 5.
"I know John Collins talks about brotherhood and ""The Other Guys"" but he has been insanely subpar for the majority of these playoffs especially for a guy that was claiming he's a max player earlier on. He hasn't played like the second best player that many Hawks fans believe he is.  This is more Huerter/Bogi vs Middelton/Jrue that Adam Silver was not hoping for."
Middleton vs John Collins in pivotal ECF game üî•üî•üî•
John Collins vs Khris Middleton was not the ECF matchup Adam silver was hoping for I'm guessing
even then John Collins got caught and got suspend for 30% of the season. It's kind of strict but not really. Could have banned him for the whole season if they really wanted to be aggressive.
"I love John Collins, but saying Kevin Love and KP are making that money isn't really a good argument because everyone agrees those are 2 of the worst contracts in the NBA. I want a max player to be able to create his own shot, which Collins can't. 77% of his points this year have been assisted. He also isn't a real presence on defense. That said, I won't be upset if we give him a max because his chemistry with Trae is what makes the team tick and he really is a great player."
"He's 23, athletic, can shoot, and decently good on defense. He's not gonna be a focal point offensively but he's a great piece to have. A max for John Collins is about 32M/year or about what Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, and Kristaps Porzingis are making right now. I don't see why he shouldn't get that much money."
John Collins is one of the best personalities in the league. Dude is a gem.
"&gt;I fully believe we wouldn't have utilized Trae correctly and he would not have become this Trae Young with the Grizzlies.  Trae put up 29.6/4.3/9.3 on 59.5% TS in his 2nd year while being coached by one of the worst coaches to grace the NBA recently and playing on arguably the worst roster in the entire NBA, especially accounting for John Collins' 25 game suspension.   Even his rookie year he put up 19/8 on 54% TS.   A lot of their pieces have come together this year, but Atlanta was an awful situation for Trae's first 2 years. The guy was bust-proof. His ""struggles"" consisted of Summer League and like the first 20 games of his rookie season."
"If you are counting PED‚Äôs, John Collins had 25 games"
"Sorry Hawks, Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter, John Collins, other young players I can't remember; they've all peaked. The only way is down from here."
I fear Hawks more than Bucks.  Ive seen enough Suns vs Bucks games where the Bucks didn't have enough fire power and Ayton was able to prevent Giannis from going 40 points on 70% efficiency.... The devil you know... Basically.  Hawks?  With Trae Young's ability to shoot from anywhere half court... And John Collins get key offensive rebounds out of nowhere... And also Huerter channeling mini Klay Thompson offensively.... They are more unprecitable.  Losing Hunter was huge though as he was big against the Suns last time they played.
"Same, I had to look up why Collins was popped  https://www.nba.com/news/hawks-john-collins-suspended-25-games-ap"
John Collins was strong enough that Khris Middleton couldnt create space for his jumper. He was short a ton when cam wasnt on the floor too.
Said the Wolves turned down an offer of John Collins for Beasley and a 1st which was later reported to never have happened
"Warriors so far over the cap, it's in their best interest to resign Oubre and find a trade partner.   Derozan perhaps? Otto Porter? Porzingis? Markannen? John Collins?"
"Bruh joel embiid did the same thing to john collins, they were diving for a ball, why would solomon hill care ab hurting a player in the regular season that isnt even in his conference."
"&gt;Even going into this round ‚Äî even after we bounced the #1 seed!! I think people still kind of assumed we were just ‚Äúhappy to be here.‚Äù So-and-so on Philly got injured, or so-and-so wasn‚Äôt shooting, those were the big conversations coming out of that series. And meanwhile we‚Äôre over here just minding our business, flying to Milwaukee, and winning another Game 1 on the road.  &gt; That‚Äôs what I love about this team.  &gt;We have a group that‚Äôs straight-up fearless. You might have more ‚Äústars‚Äù than us, or more hype than us, or more playoff experience than us, or whatever it may be. But you‚Äôre not going to scare us. You‚Äôre never going to scare us. And that‚Äôs because we just know, no matter what‚Äôs been happening in the game up to any point ‚Äî at some point?? We‚Äôre giving you buckets.  &gt;Buckets and buckets.  John Collins two days ago saying they are absolutely not just happy to be there"
The Baptist for John Collins is pretty good. I heard that this playoffs for the first time. My all time favorite nickname is for IT - ‚Äúthe little guy‚Äù (tommy heinsohn voice)

"I think it's more of roster issue than Giannis. I like Middleton and Jrue but neither are particularly good at creating for Giannis. Ideally, I see Giannis's offense as a superstar version of John Collins and Taj Gibson - transition, pick and roll finisher, lob threat, putbacks, and draining open sideline jumpers (threes should be much more rare). He needs more of a post-game for the playoffs too (at the C spot, which they can play in specific lineups like Lakers do with AD).  For that though, you'd need a superstar ball handling guard with range - someone like Dame or Harden. They'd always have the mismatch with pick and rolls, especially with Giannis at C. It's obviously not realistic but it would be absolutely lethal. This series, I really like Giannis taking those jumpers 1-2 steps out of the paint vs open 3s (that the defense wants him to take)."
John Collins is a name to consider
that was john collins
How can Luka and Zion leave? Luka will be a RFA and they will obviously off him a max contract. Zion still has 2 years of team options and is then a RFA also. Like yeah they can demand a trade but it's gonna take a MASSIVE trade to get either of them so idk man.   If Luka forces his way out can we say that the Hawks won the trade? And what does an unbiased person think about Zion traded to the Hawks for like 3 firsts and John Collins or something.
Really hard to say. Maybe around Myles Tuner/John Collins level so like 15-20
John Collins didn‚Äôt when Embiid jumped at his legs‚Ä¶
"Bucks can beat the hawks if the 76ers lose that series.  The Bucks would be heavy favourites against Hawks. However, Atlanta has got defenders like Capela and John collins that can build a wall and stop Giannis from scoring at the rim. It can be a tough series for the buck as I think the atlanta hawks are underrated.  Trae Young is a star player."
"He‚Äôs barely played because of injury but he had a promising end of his rookie year and an abysmal start this year. He‚Äôs since grown 2-3 inches, he looks taller than John Collins and Capela at a quick glance, and that‚Äôs with a haircut. A 6‚Äô9-10‚Äù ~ wing that can handle the ball decently and defend at a high level is very intriguing on paper, and if he can turn that pretty release into actual shot creation on the court, he can quietly be a very unique prospect"
John Collins was born in Utah
"Public and currently playing, with currently playing being a stretch. Jason Collins signed a contract with the Nets after coming out. John Amaechi is also out. Those are the only two off the top of my head.  Rick Welts is an out exec and just retired. Becky Hammon is an out assistant coach, but female.  On the one hand I'm super excited for more to come out and NBA players just be able to live their authentic lives, but on the other hand I totally don't care because it really doesn't matter. Gay or straight, I just want to judge how attractive their S/O is ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
"You can't fault him for being on teams that also had other talent. And last year the OKC Thunder had no business being the playoffs but he lead them there. Trae Young is definitely showing us what he can do in the playoffs though and I am super impressed. But he also has a lot of young talent in his team, John Collins and Bogdanovic are really good players. Let's see if they can pull of the upset, I am excited!"
John Collins and 3 firsts for Zion who says no?
"Ask anyone just 6 months ago if they‚Äôd rather have Clint Capela and John Collins or KP and Josh Richardson on /r/NBA and everyone would say the latter. Luka is a great passer and playmaker but Trae‚Äôs ability to run an offense and raise a player‚Äôs floor is on another level imo. I believe that‚Äôs more the reason for discrepancy between the teams than actual talent.  Also, the Clippers successfully exploited Luka on defense far more than either Philly or New York has to Trae, so the defensive argument doesn‚Äôt hold water. Any competent front office would rather have a deep playoff run from their young star than All-NBA awards, hell, it might be seen as a positive given they don‚Äôt have to pay him a supermax contract."
"Not one second did I believe that Clint capela, John Collins, Lou Williams, Gallo, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, fucking Bogdanovic  Is worse than Kleber, Brunson, THj, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, DFS.  Not one fucking second. Every GM would rather take the hawks core then and now, just like they would take Luka instead of Trae if they could choose right now.  Your just on a fucking mission and you fail to see how weirdly you spin your take. The mavs players are shit, their boxscores look ok because of Luka, and you then put the Luka inflated role player stats to say his team is better. Whatever  Trae is fucking lit anyway"
"Are y‚Äôall on crack?   Bogdanovic, Capela, John Collins, Gallinari, Huerter, Deandre Hunter, &amp; Lou Will is comparable if not WORSE to you than Porzingis, Tim Hardaway, and like, Jalen Brunson and Kleber? Old man JJ Reddick?   Seriously? I literally attended OU while Trae Young was a student, I love the guy, but I‚Äôm not going to say he‚Äôs better than Luka for being in the East 2nd round when we know for a fact the Clippers would have also beat this Hawks team."
"Top Six, sure, but I don't see Top Two.  The current Top Three in the East are all better on paper based on who would appear to be returning.   The Hawks are overachieving above their talent level right now, in addition to benefiting from Philly injuries.  (The loss of Danny Green + Joel not at 100% &gt; loss of DeAndre Hunter)  It's probably not sustainable once regression to the norm takes place next season. Furthermore, we don't know what's happening with John Collins.   But for now, fuck who knows how far they go.  If they capitalize on this year's craziness and get a title, it's as legit as any other."
"Please compare the rosters. The Hawks team last year was so fucking bad, legitimately a third of that roster isn't even in the league anymore.  The rest were a bunch of rookie's and John Collins who was suspended for a bunch of games.  Meanwhile the Pelicans had way better players around Zion.  Lonzo, Ingram, Adams, and even fucking Bledsoe were way better than anything we were rolling out last year.  So were Hart and NAW.  Like if that team didn't win more games than the Hawks team last year they should have been kicked out of the league.  What I'm saying is they need to build the team around Zion and his playstyle and they need to do it now.  They have the pieces to be able to move for players that will fit."
Also tried to purposefully injure John Collins by diving into his legs.
"lol you‚Äôre delusional. It must suck living with that much hate in your heart. I can‚Äôt believe how much attention that John Collins play is getting when he was clearly just trying to get the ball, not hurt anyone, and nobody even got hurt."
I don‚Äôt see Trae leaving anytime soon and John Collins loves the city too I think. You build around those two and you‚Äôve got a team.
"He‚Äôs actually not without a doubt better, they average basically the same assist numbers over their career in the reg season and playoffs, also luka is 6 foot 8 with generational vision, every pass that trae is able to make luka can make and more due to his size, that argument makes no sense   Imagine if luka had John Collins"

"Yeah, the 4's in the playoffs are Jae Crowder, Marcus Morris, Royce O'neal, Tobias Harris, John Collins, Giannis, and Durant. Basically just small forwards or tweeners.   Maybe a few years ago with someone like LMA playing the 4 it would be a problem, but not so much these days"
John Collins would be exciting to watch
A player like John Collins.  Love has been a bum for the last 3 years and a locker room cancer to boot
"&gt;Kevin Heurter and John Collins just heavily contributed to us winning a trip to the ECF and they were both drafted at 19, 3 and 4 years ago.  A lot of guys have the talent and it's a matter of investing in them to develop their game.  The talent dropoff is not as sharp as people act even if it seems that way because there are just limited minutes for NBA players on the fringe of being rotation players  Yes, but neither Heurter nor Collins are franchise players.   The talent drop off matters a lot because securing a franchise player is the key to becoming a championship team. Collins and Huerter are the players you want to pick up after you find your franchise player."
"Kevin Heurter and John Collins just heavily contributed to us winning a trip to the ECF and they were both drafted at 19, 3 and 4 years ago.  A lot of guys have the talent and it's a matter of investing in them to develop their game.  The talent dropoff is not as sharp as people act even if it seems that way because there are just limited minutes for NBA players on the fringe of being rotation players"
I think Ayton matches up well with John Collins and Capela
You mean John Collins or Capella???
"It's not just that they don't get high draft picks, it's that they don't draft particularly well.  For example, in 2017 they drafted TJ Leaf and the very next pick was John Collins.   In 2019, they drafted Goga and two picks later was Thybulle.  Yeah okay, you're not expecting superstars that late but you have to find people that can contribute and be a part of your team and they don't do that.  They also deal 1st-rounders more frequently for veterans players but again, don't have much to show for it.  No first in 2014, 2016 or 2020.  They just have to do better with what they have."
In no order:   Dame  Kawhi  Kd Bron Giannis  Pg13  Lowry  Embiid  Ad  Jokic  Kyrie  Harden  Curry Ingram  Dfox Jamal Murray  Dmitch  Booker  Luka  Trae  Tatum  Jaylen brown  Gobert  Siakam  OG anunoby  Beal Kat  Jimmy  Cp3 Jrue holiday  Randle  Lavine  Zion  Sabonis  Middleton  Demar  Vucevic  Sabonis  Ayton  John Collins
"Wish they would've given it to someone much younger like Michael Porter, or John Collins. It's not like they're in dire need of veteran leadership. It's such a bizarre pickup to me."
John Collins‚Ä¶ kinda drawing a blank after that though because they aren‚Äôt that deep at that position
"Have you looked at the FAs? DeRozan is the best available FA in the class. My hope is resign him and get John Collins or Lauri, or package a big trade w the Warriors and get Wiseman and a pick for some of our stuff.  Hard pass on Simmons right now, if we were capstrapped it‚Äôd be different, but I‚Äôm not in on trading pieces of our core for Ben Simmons when we can just sign dudes w our cap space that are close to the same and lose no one."
"Jabari Parker was supposed to be a sixth man on a projected 30 win team. The goal wasn‚Äôt to win games. Why is this difficult for you understand? Schlenk came in at a time where the team got bounced from the first round of the playoffs, and our only true positive assets were basically Taurean Prince and John Collins. That team was obviously going nowhere. He took a team with a lack of assets and got them to the eastern conference finals in three years. That‚Äôs objectively very fucking impressive and you know it."
"Harris was legit missing open lay ups and easy wide open shots,  NO ONE was contesting him on most of them. If he made those, yall would be shitting on John Collins.  Credits to the efficient 14/16 game missing only 1 shot in a G7, where efficiency is usually lower."
John Collins S&amp;T for Simmons
"&gt;You can add context to them, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you get to blatantly dismiss them.  We can blantly dismiss traes rookie season against the bucks when we our roster was 95% different and he was a rookie. Hueter was a rookie and John Collins was in his second year. Theres no other players still on our roster from that team. His stats from those games have no bearing on this coming series. Did you compare the nets the last three years against the bucks before that series?  &gt;Bucks have been a continuously good defensive team.  Philly supposedly had the best defense and he just averaged 29/11."
"Ah so then we get a discussion about whether their was intent about John Collins‚Äô arm? It sounds as if you‚Äôre contesting that there was intent and therefore there was a flagrant foul by Collins, which would absolutely overrule any cylinder violation.  But that is a different conversation. I don‚Äôt think Collins intentionally struck Embiid; his eyes and all his attention are on catching the ball and completing the alley-oop. But yes, I agree, if Collins‚Äô contact could have been construed as flagrant than for sure it‚Äôs a foul on him.  Assuming it is not flagrant, then it‚Äôs still Embiid‚Äôs foul. Imagine, for a second, that Collins did *not* hit Embiid with his arm. Watch the play again from the moment Collins jumps to where he lands. We can see that the contact with, and backwards momentum from, Embiid causes Collins to land a good metre or metre and a half from where he would have landed if there was no contact. This is not a matter of ‚Äúno contact‚Äù, because we know that Embiid would have made contact with Collins regardless of whether Collins made contact with him ‚Äúfirst‚Äù. We can agree on that much, yes?"
"Agree, Capela is very underrated and can pose serious problems for the Bucks.      Hawks will likely have to resort to switching and help defense just to contain Giannis in the paint. But most likely, they'll just force him to shoot the 3. Or let him pass to Jrue from the three (clearly not ideal, but Jrue has been struggling a bit in the playoffs - despite clutch moments)     Bucks will have to overplay their starters, as their bench will get destroyed by the Hawks' depth.      I'm curious, do we know how good John Collins is at boxing out? Cause Brook Lopez is incredible at boxing out, which tremendously helps his teammates get rebounds. So I can see him doing a decent job containing Capella, unless Collins can do the same."
"Remember thinking the same thing about John Stockton's record breaking assist, an off-the-mark pass the Malone corralled, took a dribble, and hit a fadeaway: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG85NR0Tesk&amp;ab\_channel=KSLSports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG85NR0Tesk&amp;ab_channel=KSLSports)  Seems related: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o2gddn/collins\_john\_stockton\_yes\_that\_one\_is\_in\_this/h26c8gx?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o2gddn/collins_john_stockton_yes_that_one_is_in_this/h26c8gx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
Remember okc‚Äôs three guard set from when they had Cp3? The long boy version:   Ja morant   SGA   Simmons   John Collins  J3
And John Collins presence from a mile away.
Tell that to John Collins and Kevin Huerter
"I'm so tired of hearing Luka would do this and that in the east. You are speculating. Plus, Cam Reddish has been nice when he has been healthy. Also, a part of that deal.  Yep, he signed Rondo. And yep he flipped him for a better player and better team fit in Lou Will.  'The rest of the league didnt have cap space' is about the dumbest argument I ever heard in regards to his FA signings.  He is clearly one of the best GMs in the league. He drafted John Collins and Kevin Huerter at 19. He drafted/traded for  a superstar in Trae. He drafted potential all-stars in DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish and traded for a top 5 NBA center for literally nothing.  You are hating so hard."
"A decent amount of players have max-contract when they are really overpaid on some level.  I would rather have Siakam on the Raptors overpaid by $5M/year than not have him.  CJ, Gobert, Bam are max contract/ max extensions and not 1st options and John Collins and Randle are probably going to be maxed."
"He's overrated compared to other great centers, he's put in the same table as Hakeem for God's sake, he's no Shaq, no Timmy, not even Jokic. He's overrated because he gets the free pass yet he has never delivered.    I don't know about previous years, but this year he missed two winning free throws in game 5 against the Hawks, then he bricked his team out of the game in game 7. He choked, but he blames his team mate, that's rich.  He's got a lot of excuses, the buzzer beater, the roster, the coach, the injuries, but it's never on him, that's being weak and overrated. He couldn't even handle John Collins, he couldn't go to the rim and dominate using his size, he's like this oversized ballerina who flops. Gobert took the L with more dignity.  He excels at memeing, that's it."
"Hawks are an interesting case. Injuries have hurt their young guys significantly, and some of their older guys are on deals which could be atrocious soon (Bogdanovic and Gallo especially). John Collins could also walk or get greatly overpaid by them, limiting their future as well."
"I just don‚Äôt particularly like their future contract situation. The Gallo and Bogdanovic contracts could be really bad if either one starts facing injury issues, and John Collins could still walk despite the success of this year. They‚Äôre a great team and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be competitive for a long time, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll be true finals contenders with a Healthy Nets, competitive Bucks, retooled Celtics/Sixers, and desperate Heat/Bulls in the East."
"Trae Young was alienating John Collins to the point where Collins called him out for his selfish shot attempts and Trae also got his head coach fired, though. Tell me what the fuck that says?"
I was gonna say John Collins as a joke for second best after Bam but the more I think about it I think he's like 3rd after Turner
"Out of curiosity I ranked players by PPG to see how many have a negative AST/TO. The only players with negative ratios in the top 100 are:    Embiid - 2.8/3.1   MPJ - 1.1/1.3   John Collins - 1.2/1.3   Clint Capela - 0.8/1.2   DeAndre Ayton - 1.4/1.5   Rudy Gobert - 1.3/1.7   Darius Bazley - 1.8/2.2   Lauri Markannen - 0.9/1.0   Brook Lopez - 0.7/0.9    That‚Äôs the list. 91 other players are able to shoulder a scoring burden without having a negative ratio, regardless of their position or role in the offense.   The thing all these guys have in common? No handles. I think if Embiid wants to take another step towards being the most dominant player in the league has has to work on his handles and reading the defense when he‚Äôs double-teamed in the post."
They assumed it was an easy win because of the way they blew out our D-Team twice in like the span of 3 days mostly playing their bench players to clinch the #1 seed.    Our only starter really on the floor for those games at the end of the season was John Collins and he laid 2 big eggs in terms of stepping up when needed.    So I can see how they assumed they'd roll over us...Whoops
"i don't think it's a coincidence it's Danny who's saying this. always was an A+ locker room guy, and he's right in saying it. yes, Simmons was a huge disappointment and was a direct negative on them because he couldn't hit free throws. that said, there just was never much scoring on this team outside of Embiid and Seth Curry.   Maybe I'm just blinded by trade potential but I think if you give him wide open spacing  where it can be his own team, I think he can be a great player. he isn't a no. 1 on a champion, but he's still a very good NBA player. I mean shit, were talking about maxing John Collins in our sub, is it that outlandish to prefer Simmons over that? I don't think so."
"Nah, quite the contrary. John Collins is my best friend"
"it's a sensitive subject for sure, and it's not easy for Blazer fans since the team does get overlooked and there's a regular trope about Dame wanting to leave (it's louder than it's ever been lately but it's been persistent), so it's natural to want to stick up for the franchise.  And Neil has made some good moves, I've always described him as incredibly high variance, he either hits a home-run (drafting Dame, getting Nurkic AND a first for Plumlee) or brutally strikes out (paying $200M for Meyers, Crabbe, Harkless &amp; ET; trading up to take Zach Collins ahead of Mitchell/OG/Bam/John Collins, drafting Anfernee Simons when the team needed help immediately).  Olshey can't change gears, and that will kill you as a small market GM, the margin for error is as slim as it gets.  Bring on the rain, if for no other reason than to keep knocking down all the pollen in the air!"
"Probably because both teams runs have unusual circumstances. Miami with the bubble and nothing against ATL but they beat a very weak NYK team round 1 and round 2 benefitted from a complete mental breakdown of the other teams starting PG.  Kinda similar to the 07 Cavs making the finals and everyone thinking that was the turning point for them and Lebron. Boobie had a big game and we thought he could breakout as a second scorer. Turns out we just beat some past their prime teams in the nets and pistons and our team was actually awful and never made the finals again the rest of lebrons initial tenure.  Luckily for ATL I think their roster is constructed far far better than those Cavs were and they have more potential to build off this. Trae is ridiculous and John Collins is a great modern big man to have who gives such an advantage with his athleticism and shooting. They've also got some young long wings that if they can take some next steps they could be really dangerous. Reddish specifically if he can start hitting 3's, he's an 80% FT shooter so it's definitely possible."
I wanted Atlanta to win I'm just saying they did a bad job and they didn't show one angle on TV the way it's printed on John Collins shirt
"John Collins would have thrown down Mjolnir on that rim sending a clap of thunder throughout the Wells Fargo Center, and then turned and flexed on the Philly crowd to juice up his teammates for that final 3 minutes.  Ben Simmons though just be like ""Hot Potato!"""
"This is crazy I just looked up the stats for that game and the Timberwolves held Trae Young, Kevin Heuter, Clint Capela, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdonavic, Lou Williams, Oneyeka Okongu, and John Collins to 10 points combined that game.  It's almost like they are two completely different teams and at that time the Hawks did suck."
"Or his best friend, John Collins"
"The only player the Hawks had when the Luka/Trae trade happened was John Collins who would be utilized the same way Dallas utilized KP. The other moves to build the roster, you can't say either team makes the same moves. Huerter makes less sense at 19 in the same draft, Hawks don't make deals that give them the assets for Hunter, Capela, etc, of course Reddish.   ""Replace Luka with X"" is such a bs answer. Your GM, HC, and Front Office is a huge issue, and Luka's ball dominance makes him more difficult to play with, that's something he'll learn. Hopefully, the new guys build a tailor made roster for his talents like Schlenk did for Trae."
John Collins was a monster even then tbh
On the thread about John Collins people were on there saying Collins has a shot to get maxed. If John Collins is even in the conversation for the max then Lavine is an absolute lock for a max. He‚Äôs 27ppg on excellent to elite efficiency. Efficient high volume scoring is the single most valuable skill in today‚Äôs NBA.
"Cool. Kevin Huerter and John Collins, two players that played key rolls in sending the 76ers packing, were both picked 19th. Good GMs can find value elsewhere in the draft. Brand and Colangelo made a bunch of bad moves, but Hinkie didn't exactly do them any favors by wasting lottery picks on bad players or bad fits."
 Yeah. Bucks really shouldn‚Äôt have any issue running through the remaining teams barring Phoenix.   Giannis over the past 3 games is a blueprint of what putting John Collins on Giannis will look like.  Bud will find a way to mess that up.
John Collins super underrated key player to the Hawks win
I get that and yeah he definitely wasn't shooting super efficiently but being able to consistently just get to the spots to score especially against elite defenses like Philly is big  like sure technically Gallo or John collins was more efficient but Trae makes like 75% of the offense happen
John Collins gonna have to earn that max contract this series lol
You're a delusional moron.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PkxZHwEPOo   The ball is 4 feet above embiid's head. He's not diving for anything but the knee of John Collins. He isn't pushed. This is a dirty fucking play. Enjoy your offseason bro and trust the process.
"You're genuinely dumb if you believe embiid falling was him ""diving at john collins knees."" Get a Grip"
"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying Young or Ayton are better but it‚Äôs definitely interesting to see their teams have success‚Ä¶‚Äù  Come on bro, it‚Äôs not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K‚Äôvon Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don‚Äôt recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he‚Äôs so big and strong. He‚Äôs an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I‚Äôm wrong."
So play John Collins at center? Seems to me Giannis would kill them
If John Collins gets a max that will be one of the worst contracts in the league in less than 3 years. He‚Äôs young but he‚Äôs not that young and is not good on defense. Without Trae (or a similar playmaker) he is pretty limited offensively. He should realistically get like $20mil a year but anymore than that is setting up for pain down the road.
"Lol, but why keep picks when you do stuff like pick Dennis Smith Jr when Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, John Collins and OG Anunoby are all still on the board?"
It‚Äôs gonna be a tough situation for both sides during John Collins free agency
John Collins is so cool lmaoüòÇ
"Yes, because they'd still be trading for Chris Paul and not a big if they had Doncic\s. It's like the iq in these threads are decreasing by 2 points everyday. And the Hawks assumptions don't even have any factual back up lol. It's just ""This is what would happen because team pawah"". I mean, John Collins literally made the same complaints about Trae less than six months ago and then he learnt his place when Trae going passive for a few games screwed them over. Doncic would slot in that place just fine, and with an extra foot of length in defense even if he slacks off as much as trae."
