"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"I'm laughing my ass off at some of these turnovers, but on the inside I know I'll face karma when my team has to give Jeff Teague and Tremont Waters significant minutes running the offense for a week"
Almost certain it‚Äôs Tremont Waters
"Celtics are suddenly crazy thin at Guard. Kemba is just now coming back from injury and can't play big minutes, Pritchard's out, Smart is out, Romeo (more of a wing than a guard imo but listed as a combo guard) is still out.  Lineup is likely: Kemba / Jaylen / Jayson / Theis / Tristan with Teague and Tremont Waters as the only other guys who can run the offense coming off the bench."
But can I interest you in undersized scoreing point guards who cannot score neither create for others nor defend?  I got a Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters special just for you!   Smh
Don't disrespect CT legend Tremont Waters!
"&gt;Ex: Russel Westbrook-cannot shoot,would disrupt offense and isn‚Äôt specifically the greatest on defense and purposely goes after triple doubles.   There are hundreds of guys in the NBA who are a worse 2 man pairing with LeBron than Westbrook. Whatever you may think of Westbrook a LeBron/Westbrook pairing has significantly more talent than a LeBron/Tremont Waters or LeBron/Thon Maker pairing. The bottoms of NBA rosters get real bad real quick. Westbrook may not fit well with LeBron, but the 2 of them would be a remotely competitive playoff team with average pieces around them."
"Pritchard is great, you can already tell he will be in the league for 10 years. Super solid.  Nesmith is absolute garbage so far. I'm not writing him off after 5 games but he must be complete ass in practice for him to not get any playing time with our roster so depleted. Brad will play Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters together (worst backcourt of all time) before giving Nesmith any minutes, and I can't even fault him from how Nesmith looks so far. The **one thing** he's supposed to be able to do is shooting and his current shooting splits are .217/.188/---. He's even shooting 1/9 on ""wide open"" threes which NBA.com defines as no defender within 6 ft."
Neismith and Tremont Waters gonna get 3rd quarter minutes in this one?
Tacko and semi look like different men this year. Tremont waters though... I hadn't seen him that much til the magic game last night but reddit was right about him. He needs way more time
Tremont Waters is literally above average height for an adult man. Tacko just turns everyone into a child.
"I was wondering why one of the little kids had tattoos before I realized it wasn't a little kid, it was Tremont Waters a little adult."
one of the kids in the pool is Tremont Waters lmao
Semi? What about Tremont Waters?
"That you said ""tell me how it feels"" and watching Carsen edwards and tremont waters play basketball is enough to prove empathy? You douche?"
"[Marcus Smart, Jeff Teague, Payton Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1348353329529761793)"
"I honestly think that's their problem. Neither of them are ever going to be stars, but with their talent they could carve out a place for themselves as role players.   Every time they get playing time it's like they're trying to prove they should be starting when all we need them to do is make open shots, play hard on defense, and not turn the ball over.   There is no situation where Tremont Waters should be taking a contested shot with time left on the shot clock."
"Well you can look at the Celtics, if Brown, Ojeleye and Green are out due to safety protocols related to Tatum's positive case.   They'd be looking at Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Jeff Teague, Marcus Smart, Tremont Waters, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall.  That's 6 guards 6'4 and under (4 under 6'1), Theis and Fall.  0-7 waiting to happen in the next two weeks if they're forced to play and Brown, Ojeleye and Green are held out."
I will personally contract COVID and hand deliver Tremont Waters a vial of my saliva to use on his test if it means we don‚Äôt have to play a game with this lineup
"What is their rotation going to be?  Jaylen seems to be the only good player.  Is PP seriously their second best player right now with everyone out?  Tacko, Tremont Waters, and Carson Edwards are going to get 30 minutes a night for the next week."
That means Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters get more playing time   Great news for Celtics fans üòÇ
"What does ‚Äútoo long a leash‚Äù even mean? Did you want him to pull smart? Who would he put in Teague? He was fucking terrible. PP was already out there when we were losing the lead, so carsen edwards? Tremont waters? He doesn‚Äôt control these guys like 2k. Tatum gave it to smart with like 5 seconds on the shot clock and he had to take a bull shit shot"
We‚Äôll give you Tremont Waters knees for Aaron Gordon
"yeah, because teams weren't targeting Pritchard, Teague, or fuckin' 5'10"" Tremont Waters on offense either"

They can have Tremont Waters or Carson Edwards if they want.
I'd take Tremont Waters first overall in an expansion draft.
"&gt;Tremont Waters.  IT was our starting point guard for like half the season last year.  He looked awful, played awful, couldn't defend. He did make open threes though."
"[Idc for who‚Äôs better, but Tremont Waters can hoop FR](https://youtu.be/a7f0-kg8qWM)"
"Ignoring health concerns (which is a major factor here, but anyway), IT is indeed probably still better than half the players in the NBA, and that's actually kind of the problem.  Guys like Tremont Waters know their role on the team as an end of bench type.  You think IT is going to be happy on the end of the bench only seeing spot minutes?  No - he's going to want to reclaim his former glory and that's just going to cause problems."
"Jordan at 57 is probably better than Tremont Waters, but that is the deeper issue you're talking about."
You cant convince me IT right now isnt better than Tremont Waters. I know its a deeper issue than that but I never wanna see that dude touch the floor again if we can help it lol
"The Celtics started and gave 24 minutes to Tremont Waters last night. Is he so much better than those guys? Or maybe, just maybe, it's possible to steal a few minutes here and there with fringe NBA guys.  It doesn't take much to keep a guy under 42 minutes in the second week of the season. It's not some crazy ask."
Fine. But be honest about that. Say you don't mind taking the risk to win some games. Don't come in here claiming the Knicks literally had no other choice.  The Celtics started Tremont fucking Waters last night and he got 24 minutes. Thibs could have stolen some minutes with those guys. It's not impossible.
Tremont Waters has played like ~ten minutes total right?
"I mean they've been in 3 of the past 4 Eastern Conference Finals and the ""top guys"" are steadily improving. Kemba hasn't played yet, we have a 28 million TPE, and we've had so many injuries that G-leaguers like Carson Edwards and Tremont Waters have been getting steady minutes this year. So no, I'm not particularly worried about starting ""only"" 5-3.  The loss to Brooklyn we looked bad and they looked amazing. Our other two losses are on a buzzer-beater to the Pacers on the road which isn't too bad, and I'm willing to forgive a hungover as balls horrendous New Years Day performance vs Detroit."
"His stats were artificial though. He got them mostly when Nurse put him out against the Celtics bench. It was like Payton Pritchard, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, and Rob Williams against the Raptors starting unit. I think his first half stats are more relevant to his play."
Tremont Waters will be playing in an Eastern European country you‚Äôve never heard of by the end of the year
"Tremont Waters posted quite possibly the worst plus minus in a double digit win that I've ever seen. How is it even possible to be -17 in a game that your team wins by 12, I watched the whole game and I still don't get it."
"I‚Äôll be your bridge, o‚Äôer Tremont Waters..."
No class. Danny Ainge should show a spine and suspend him and let Tremont Waters start instead
Tremont Waters lost the lead by himself in +/-
Celtics starting point guard Tremont Waters.
Losing to a team that started Tremont Waters in a double big lineup should count as like 3 losses.
Everytime Tremont Waters came off for Payton Pritchard the whole team looked revitalized
it was the c's third stringers too.. hence why jaylen and jayson were out. they started tremont waters
Tremont Waters is -17 in this game lol
Tremont Waters is not an NBA player
No Kemba no Smart no Teague starting Tremont Waters on the back end of a back to back against a really good defensive team and he's doing this when the entire offense is him and Jaylen.
I figure it‚Äôs so our bench isn‚Äôt complete ass.  Can you imagine Tremont Waters leading our offense?
Why is Tremont Waters starting?
We're starting Tremont Waters. You guys have a pretty good chance.
8 mile and Tremont Waters gonna earn their game checks tonight.
Which Celtic will have a career high tonight? ü§î  Tremont Waters?  Carsen Edwards?  JEFF TEAGUE?
"I was taking a weighted average of the Celtics roster.  Theis=5th man.  Semi, Javonte Green, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters &amp; Jeff Teague are all 11th-14th men to out of the league so they drag him down with them."
"This is Tatum's fourth year in the league.  This is Brown's fifth.  I'm old enough to remember when Paul Pierce was young. And everyone took it easy, until one day, Pierce was 2/3rds of the way through his prime, and *then* Ainge got off his ass, and went out and got KG and Ray.  Tatum and Brown are capable of being the best two players on a title-winning team *right now*. And these guys aren't going to be young very long. If we're still hoping the Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters ""develop"" into anyting even *remotely* title-worthy five years from now, then we may as well not even bother.  The Celtics are very much *not* in a good position."
Never seen guard Tremont Waters though. Danny always 5 steps ahead
"To offer a somewhat serious reply - it's difficult to judge the recent picks too much. For one, 2nd round picks rarely ever pan out, and so there's no surprise guys like Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters aren't anything noteworthy (shoutout to Semi Ojeleye though, who's actually a contributor). And even first-rounders don't carry a high guarantee of success.  As for his first-round picks, Romeo Langford has been injured more than not, and that's never a good sign for any player's potential. But when he did play, it did look like he belonged in the league. Time will tell what becomes of him once he returns.  Speaking of time, Rob Williams is a pretty underrated prospect. Yeah he's already in his 3rd year and is 23, but he was always a project to begin with, and this year he's definitely shown a lot of improvement with his defense. His minutes aren't very high, but that's supposedly so his hip problem doesn't flare up too soon into the season. If he can put everything he has together, he'd definitely be outplaying his #27 draft selection.  Grant Williams is okay, it's hard to see him getting a 2nd contract at this point, but he looked better last year, so there's hope he can revert (his 3P% is up at least).  It's way too early to tell with Nesmith, but he's definitely not a James Young kind of player. His career will rely on being able to knock down 3s consistently.  As for Ainge getting better results from these draft picks - one could certainly argue for that. What was once a treasure trove of picks has now resulted in a lot of uncertainty. It didn't help that both the Kings and Grizzlies played above expectations (they were seen as surefire top 7 picks prior). But in order for him to sell those picks, there had to be buyers - and not a lot of buyers want late lottery/mid-20s picks and nothing else. Ainge was definitely targeting someone like Jrue Holiday, but the Bucks' offer was simply too much for him to match.  I do think it's unfortunate so many players left the C's without compensation, such as Horford, Irving, and Morris. Rozier and Hayward as well, sort of, though we'll see how that TPE and Kemba's knee turn out. I just think his draft assets - combined with the success of Tatum/Brown -  got way overhyped."
They should start Tremont Waters at the 3 over Jayson Tatum by the same logic.
"Sadly in this case it is. Grant Williams, Javonte Green, and Tremont Waters are not NBA players. Semi Ojeleye and Carsen Edwards are maybe 12th men. There's 5 guys, an entire lineup, that doesn't belong on a contending team. The only real case is Ojeleye would be a fine 12th man on a contender.  There's plenty of current free agents that would be better. The Nets just released like 3 guys who would be upgrades didn't they?"
"What are you talking about, this is every player they've drafted in the last 3 years:  1.14 Nesmith  1.26 Pritchard  2.47 Madar  1.14 Langford  1.22 Grant Williams  2.51 Tremont Waters  1.27 Robert Williams  Which of those picks are 'horrendous?'"
Tremont Waters with the MVP garbage time performance
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernang√≥mez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
"You can say ‚ÄúKeep in mind‚Äù but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his ‚ÄúLA or bust‚Äù thing wasn‚Äôt even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don‚Äôt really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn‚Äôt been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
"Yup, but Ainge will offer two second rounders and Tremont Waters."
"You don‚Äôt even have to say besides, it is Tremont Waters. This is literally not debatable."
"Pick your poison Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Jeff Teague."
"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
PP Kemba Teague Tremont Waters Javonte Green.
Look at tremont waters g league highlights n then watch him now
Imagine how good the Celtics would be if Tremont Waters was actually Prime Michael Jordan
"Doesn't make for a good segment on a talk show but they just haven't had enough good players healthy.  If you look at their totals half of their minutes are being played by dudes that I'm not sure belong in a rotation, forgetting about how crappy Smart and Kemba looked as they were first returning from injury.  For example Ojeyele, Grant Williams and Tremont Waters have played more minutes than Tatum.  TT and Pritchard have played more minutes than Jaylen Brown. Jeff Teague and Aaron Nesmith have played more than Kemba.    Looking at teams who are gonna hit the over on their win totals the Jazz have 10 players who have played 100 minutes, the Knicks have 12, the Hornets have 11 and the Celtics have 17.  Tough to establish an identity with bad players and no continuity."
"This is going to age like milk. A bunch of Celtics' fans were saying the same shit after his first good game despite Timberwolves' fans warning otherwise.  Teague is a poor defender, below average playmaker, and one of the most hesitant shooters I've seen on the C's in years. Frustrating how often Tatum would hit him with a wide open 3 just for Teague to hesitate on the shot, ruin the opportunity, and then drive into a clogged lane to throw up a clanger.   We've had Kemba, Smart, and Pritchard all miss a decent amount of time this season. Even with all that opportunity he was closer to competing with Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters than he was at solidifying a role as anything else. He'll put up 20 once a month if that's all you need out of him though."
"There's no good reason for Tremont Waters to be on an NBA team.  Nesmith consistently gets involved in plays, he deserves real minutes"
"Starter: **Mark Blount**  *Honorable mention: Ricky Davis*  -  Regular bench rotation guy: **Phil Pressey** (hard to believe there was a season where undrafted rookie Phil Pressey played 15 mpg over 75 games and started 11 times)  *Honorable mentions: Semi Ojeleye, Jeff Teague, Orien Greene, Sebastian Telfair*  -  End-of-bench guy with only a few minutes here and there: **Tremont Waters**  *Honorable mentions: Carsen Edwards, Guershon Yabusele, rookie Terry Rozier, rookie Avery Bradley*"
Kyle Korver would get minutes on several NBA teams right now. Imagine if Boston had him instead of Tremont Waters lmfao
Tremont Waters for Steph Curry.  Plenty of time to change his name.
Tremont waters would be an all star at least over there
Tremont Waters and two 2nds
"Alright, alright he made his point. We‚Äôll give Orlando Tremont Waters and two 2nd round picks for him"
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
Pistons said they wanted Tremont Waters and Angie put his foot down
"Trade Bledsoe and Adams for any picks and bad contracts that end sometime soon. Only keep Hart, Zo, Zion, and BI and build everything else around that trading everyone else and completely cleaning house.  Then I trade BI and Zion to the Celtics for Tremont Waters and Grant Williams, Lonzo and Hart to the Timberwolves for a second and filler, then resign having put solid enough pieces around them to make them hover around a 12 seed and be stuck as a bad team for decades."
Tremont Waters in shambles. Tacko Fall GOAT.
Yeah just like Tremont Waters at his best is better then LeBron at his best.  Too bad we will never see Tremont Waters best (which would be making half court shots every possession).
"This is the way. Kemba's been fine for us outside of the first \~10 games since he came back, the worst you can say is that he probably won't age great but there's only a couple years left on his contract anyway, and like you said there's no chance of getting equivalent value for him. We need veteran depth, Tremont Waters cannot be getting minutes for us next season."
"It's more of an underachieving roster than a G-League caliber roster. Their depth really isn't good at all and they have basically nothing on the wings outside of the Jays. Also when Timelord doesn't play Tristan Thompson hasn't been all that great and it kinda creates a hole at the center position.   Also none of their draft picks outside the two stars and maybe Timelord have really hit. Pritchard  is a nice piece and Williams looks good in spurts but both are bit players. Then you have Langford, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Tremont Waters, haven't really worked and if you go farther back and look at picks like Yabusele, Ante Zizic, Jabari Bird, Demetrius Jackson, Abdel Nader, those guys never really worked out. Rozier was a good pick but for the most part they haven't drafted well over the last 5 or 6 years outside of getting the two stars. It's hard when your drafting late in the first round every year but we've seen teams able to get valuable rotation pieces in the 20s where the Celtics have more or less whiffed."
We were missing 4 of our top 6 players.   Fucking Tremont Waters started.

Which team?  The one starting Tremont Waters?
"&gt; Tatum and Brown ALONE should be better than a 7/8 seed  Would a team of tatum, brown, and 13 redditors make the playoffs? Depth matters a lot. This is especially true when your roster is getting wrecked by covid/injuries. When guys like edwards, grant williams, and semi are playing real minutes, its gonna be very hard to be an elite team. They started tremont waters tonight ffs"
Tremont Waters would have to start
"Langford and Nesmith are recent lottery picks, they're not the problem. The problem is that we started Tremont fucking Waters tonight."
Tremont Waters the goat. His shots are like his name. Wet like water.
"definitely agree w this. Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Kemba, Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Rob and TT are all undersized for their position, they need to get a real big that can actually move his feet (sorry Tacko)"
"We have a lot of rookies and young guys on our bench who aren't very consistent. Pritchard's the only one who's a solid role player right now, but Nesmith, Langford, and Grant Williams have all shown some potential. Our deep bench is ass, but if the starting 5 is healthy, PP/Fournier/Langford/Nesmith/TT actually isn't that bad a rotation, we've just had to give minutes to guys like Tremont Waters because of injuries/COVID. This is a young-ass team."
"Romeo Langford has been a great defender this year but is basically a 0 on offense. He still hasn't had a healthy offseason yet and missed most of this year with injury and COVID so most fans still have a lot of hope for his ability to develop.  Grant Williams has gotten a lot better at 3 point shooting this year but his defense has slipped a bit. Fouls too much and gets blown by too easily. Drew a short straw with the rotation situation since his best position is small-ball 5 and we had 3 rotation centers ahead of him for the majority of the year. If he can get his defense up to par, he can definitely have a good career as a role player.  Carsen Edwards hasn't been as garbage as he was last year but he still doesn't belong anywhere near a rotation. When his shot isn't falling, he adds literally nothing on the court.   Tremont Waters has had some good moments when he plays with the actual rotation guys when the team is short-handed but when he is out there with the third-stringers it has been disastrous. Tough to be anything but a liability when you are 5'10.   Tacko Fall hasn't really changed at all since his first year. Very situational player. Makes too many mistakes. He is beloved by all though so it is nice having him on the roster."
"Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters are despised by the doomers on the Cs sub.   Won‚Äôt be long before everyone turns on Romeo after the ridiculous hype dies off."
Tremont waters
First and only tremont waters highlight you‚Äôll see
Tremont Waters really wanted to hand the win on a silver platter to the Hornets
It‚Äôs cause Tremont Waters is probably on the top-5 worst players in the league list
Tremont Waters is literally Prime Isaiah Thomas in a mask fuck y‚Äôall lovely people let‚Äôs goooo
"It's kinda true, how can we beat poku if Tremont waters doesn't play???"
Middleton for Tremont Waters who says no
"Scrub, should be traded to the Celtics for Grant Williams and Tremont Waters"
*Tremont Waters
Don't mind me. Just here to make Tremont Waters part of the discussion
"I definitely consider it a loss that we let Tremont Waters act like a competent NBA player out there, but that doesn‚Äôt quite cancel out the win"
"**Positives:**  Tatum had arguably his best game of his career in every aspect outside of scoring.  Tremont Waters redemption arc.  Romeo Langford D  Jabari Parker looks solid  Jaylen Brown continues to be hot  Danny Ainge commentary was great.  **Negatives:**  We lost, obviously.  Tatum had his worst scoring game in a while.   Brad continues to play Grant even though he is absolutely terrible.  Brad.  Jaylen only 15 shots and got iced out in the fourth.   All around I‚Äôm not too worried about Tatum, I mean, he has been amazing for weeks, just had an off night. Layups he makes every time going halfway down and rolling out, not to mention our best three guards and two best playmakers were out. Losing the win streak and the current seeding (obviously there is still season left) sucks, but it isn‚Äôt a loss to freak out about."
How is Tremont Waters playing significant minutes in clutch timeüò≠
This game had:  -Shit officiating (both ways)  -Jayson Tatum getting the worse triple double I have ever seen  -Tremont Waters as one of the best Celtics players on the floor  -Grant Williams interviewing for a Chicago Bulls job
Tbf you let Tremont waters go off and that‚Äôs a win in my book
Tremont Waters is doing better than Grant Williams ffs
If Tremont Waters played the whole 48 against the lakers he was on pace for -272
Scal would smoke my boy Tremont Waters easy
"Maybe we are spoiled, brother! Consummate Pro Mike Gorman and Scal has had his bumps this year but he's still very pro behind the mic. I appreciate the enthusiasm of the Hornets guy, but it sounds like the fucking X Games to me. There is no reason to scream for 20 seconds like that when the highlight of the play was Carmelo Anthony doing the ""Ol√©!"" dance 26 feet from the hoop. I'm pretty sure Tremont Waters could have dunked with that clear of a lane to sprint."
Tremont Waters at 1?
"Dort for Tremont waters, our best player, and it's a deal"
tremont waters
That‚Äôs g-league MVP Tremont Waters to you (yes I know he‚Äôs utter garbage)
"Yeah but Tremont Waters and Mo Wagner didn't tear their right ACL's twice in the span of their first 3 years in the league.  Guy has talent, more than a lot of guys on rosters with multi-year contracts right now. Teams just don't know where he is at yet and he showed he still has something left to give to the game tonight."
It‚Äôs funny how people who are ready to contribute are just on the street with no contract for weeks and players like Tremont Waters and Mo Wagner have been cashing checks all season
"Don't worry GS, Tremont Waters will carry ya'll during garbage time"
We‚Äôd give you Tremont Waters and a 2nd. Best we could do
Tremont Waters.
i can‚Äôt believe that Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters are on your team at the same time
Tremont Waters
"He's for sure been in the dog house since the last time he fucked up a lead.   It's a shame, he looked so solid and reliable for a 2-way rookie last season. At one point [teams were inquiring about him on the market.](https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2019/12/24/boston-celtics-tremont-waters-trade/)"
"Or maybe Tremont Waters, their white point guard I can‚Äôt recall, and the other Wagner bro aren‚Äôt great bench pieces"
&gt;But hey anything is better than Wagner  Can I interest you in 1 Tremont Waters?
"- Kemba - Smart - Jaylen - Jayson - Timelord - Tristan - Fournier - Grant - Pritchard - Romeo   That's 10, and all the preceding are *solid* at minimum.  - Kornet - Ojeleye - Nesmith  These three fellas are acceptably good, but only if they're individually the weakest link on the floor. More than one of them on the floor at a time is too risky, IMO.  - Carsen - Jabari  Too little (to none) sample size for me to really say; my gut says that Carsen could be fine for stretches, but like the above group, he really should be the only one from that category on the floor at a time. Putting him out there with Waters/Nesmith/Ojeleye/Wagner did him no favors in fan perception, but I think that wasn't really his fault. Obviously no clue how Jabari will be.  And the 2-way guys...  - Tacko - Tremont  Really iffy, definitely don't want these guys getting significant minutes unless absolutely necessary (excepting a 30+ point lead or something), and it's SUPER risky allowing more than 1 of them on the floor at a time if you need to keep a lead..."
it was Moe and Tremont Waters the 2 guys who were really responsible for it 3 other guys not really. Neither looked like they belong in the nba last night.
"Tremont Waters was absolute shit just like when the bench forced the starters to come back in against Toronto, but he's on a two-way so much harder to replace."
"Not released, but we traded Desmond Bane to the Grizzlies for basically nothing instead of releasing, like, Tremont Waters or whoever."
Fuck Tremont Waters
"End of bench guys (minutes played and +/-):  Carsen Edwards: 7:23, -18  Moritz Wagner: 5:11, -20  Aaron Nesmith: 4:26, -17  Semi Ojeleye: 3:43, -17  Tremont Waters: 3:43, -17"
Put some respect on the name of Tremont Waters
Tbf Ojeleye and Nesmith didn‚Äôt really do anything to blow the lead. They just happened to play with Tremont Waters and made them look bad.
When the same bench unit stayed in after the timeout at 3 and a half minutes I was close to joining the Fire Brad morons my god Tremont Waters should be left on the west coast
I am simply not concerned because tremont waters will never see legitimate NBA minutes. Our key players were and have been good. That‚Äôs a win
Tremont Waters is so so so so bad at basketball
I might sound stupid but Isaiah Thomas on a 10-day has to at least be better than what we have at least in a Teague type capacity. I really don't see any downside because I swear I can't name 5 worse players than Tremont Waters
Mo Wagner/Tremont Waters need to have their asses glued to the bench. So bad.
Trash is Tremont Waters
Tremont Waters and the tank crew forced him to come save the day lol
"Tremont Waters is the worst player in the NBA. There is no argument.  For non Celtics fans, this is not the first time he has done this. He is so bad."
Props on the Lakers bench for staying in the game and showing us again why Tremont Waters is just a waste of a roster spot
Tatum and Brown both back because the Celtics bench is a complete joke. Tremont Waters ruins yet another Gino Time. Jaylen ends up with 40.
Not while Tremont Waters üí¶ is in the same conference
&gt;The 15 worst NBA players are better than the 15 best NCAA players right now  That's not true. Tremont waters is not better than cade cunningham right now for example
"So firstly, I agree with you that availability is important. Randle had more games and minutes than Tatum. But the thing is, Tatum was closer to Randle in games played and total minutes than he was to either Paul George or Butler. Despite covid, he missed 8 games this season and played the 12th most total minutes while George and Butler aren‚Äôt even in the top 80 most minutes.    And all I‚Äôm arguing is that the Knicks‚Äô supporting cast was better this year due to health. Not saying it should have changed voting or that the higher seed shouldn‚Äôt have been taken into account, just that supporting cast isn‚Äôt something that makes sense to use against Tatum, just because of the number and quality of guys available from game to game and the constantly changing lineups.  Knicks had 11 starting lineups this year and the top two (one with Noel and one with Robinson) started 75% of games this year with one playing over 30 and the other over 20 games. We had 37 different starting lineups and the top two played 10 games and 8 games.  We started Mo Wagner and Javonte Greene. We started Kornet multiple times. We started Semi 15 times and he averaged under 5 ppg and managed to play over 900 minutes this year without getting a single block as a forward. Three times, we started Tremont Waters, our two way second year guard who more than once came so close to losing over 20 point leads in garbage time that starters had to go back in. And we started our other three sophomores who also didn‚Äôt get all rookie last year and are far from RJ‚Äôs skill level as well as both our rookies."
Was curious looked up high usage rate players and tremont waters is number 1 at 46 percent. Boston must run every play through him when he is in the game lol
I‚Äôm feeling generous let‚Äôs give them Tremont Waters too
This man said Tremont Waters I'm dead
"Luka is just Tremont Waters with a step back, embarrassing tbh"
"Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeley, Tremont Waters and Luke Kornet"
he realized he couldnt trade with these other GM's  'what do you mean you wont take Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters for Lauri and Wendell Carter?!??!?!  Have you seen them on the Maine Celtics!?'
"Not really. For now, it feels like we're getting worse in both positions. Then again, having just coached our bench, its more likely that there'll be a huge revamp on that end if we choose to finance it which is much, much, much needed. I do not want to be rooting for Tremont waters next season and talking myself into carsen Edwards getting hot."
The Tremont Waters era has begun
"Crazy, I thought Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, and Tremont Waters would be able to provide offense for the second unit.  Seriously tho. How did ainge manage to fuck this up so badly?"
Lmao this is the best one   https://www.google.com/search?q=tremont+waters+and+tacko+fall&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=nmiv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj184HU4_LwAhX3MlkFHadjAmMQ_AUoA3oECAIQAw&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=670#imgrc=VkXLTmM1f4mAtM
"Roll call for Romeo Langford, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye, Kadeem Allen, Jabari Bird, Guerschon Yabusele and Abdel Nader."
"I saw kd, kyrie, harden, grant williams, luke kornet, carsen edwards, tremont waters, romeo langford, semi ojeleye, tristan thompson at that exact same party as Porzingis"
"Pritchard at 27 isn‚Äôt anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that‚Äôs solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn‚Äôt like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it‚Äôs concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn‚Äôt pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
1. Marcus Smart taking a three 2. Grant Williams doing anything on offense 3. Tremont Waters getting minutes
Because the last time Tremont Waters and Co. were in... the Lakers caught up down 30
"So you got every team besides Celtics/Clippers/Cavs represented here.   I think our two way player Tremont Waters put up comparable numbers to several of the guys here against you guys yesterday. He has 17/5/5 and two steals in 25 minutes on 7/13 shooting 3/8 from three with the highest plus minus in the game (11 more than any Celtic and 14 more than any Knick).  For clippers and cavs, especially since efficiency isn‚Äôt a factor, I‚Äôd say Otoru with 13/12/2/2/1 in 37 minutes or Ibaka with 12/7/2/1 in only 18.5 minutes and Sexton with 16/2/5/1 in 20 minutes."
tremont waters&gt;ja
I can't believe Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters made me that nervous
Bruh if you can't beat Tremont Waters you don't deserve home court
Where are the MVP chants for Tremont Waters?
Can I interest you in one Tremont Waters? I think Mitchell Robinson and a first would be a fair return
"Tremont Waters has been absolute ass the entire season, now I know it's just because he was just saving it for today"

"Tremont Waters. I cringe every time Brad decides to start him *over* Payton Pritchard when Kemba and Smart are out. It just doesn't make any fucking sense to me, he barely gets minutes otherwise."
Who tf is this dude. Even Tremont Waters is more popular
"Yeah, but they also don't play real team basketball.  It's all hero ball with everybody trying to make a name for themselves, and it just provides a very poor representation of how a player will do in the NBA.  Case in point - look at Tremont Waters putting up an 18/7 with 2 steals as a rookie in the G League.  Meanwhile he has largely sucked badly in the NBA.  Or Anthony Bennett, #1 overall draft pick who sucked in the NBA, went and destroyed the G League for a couple of years, and then *still* couldn't find a new home in the NBA as he still sucked when teams gave him looks.  On paper the talent in the G League looks high, in reality it's a no man's land of guys who were pretty good in college but have no place in the NBA."
"In no particular order:  Kemba  Smart   Tatum (? Not sure if you're counting him as a PG, he did play a lot of ball handler)  PP  Tremont Waters  Carsen Edwards    [Brad Stevens](https://www.google.com/search?q=brad+stevens+position+high+school&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03hFkyRV-oAqmMXQVNmuHLjdx8vTg%3A1626688522714&amp;ei=Ckz1YIOBK5DM-gSK8LiADg&amp;oq=brad+stevens+position+high+school&amp;gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBQghEKABMggIIRAWEB0QHjoECCMQJzoFCAAQzQI6BggAEBYQHjoHCCEQChCgAToECCEQFVCRJFjWMGCfMmgAcAB4AIABngGIAawKkgEDOC41mAEAoAEBwAEB&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp)  ...   And then we have Jeff Teague :)   ^okay ^maybe ^he ^wasn't ^*that* ^bad"
"I don't know why my brain autopiloted to UCLA. My bad, yes, he was, with Tremont Waters lol  That's the team I was watching! I blame precaffeine brain."
"Why do people keep hyping up the G League like it means anything?  Tremont Waters absolutely tore up the G League and even put up better stats in the G League than he did in college.  Yet he completely sucks in the NBA.    Or Anthony Bennett - #1 overall draft pick who is so bad he couldn't even stick with an NBA team suddenly looked like one of the best players in the G League.    The G League is every man for themselves and barely resembles the team sport that is the NBA.  College ball actually does.    We will see.  Ultimately I don't think it much matters as talent is talent.  But I find it very strange how people are hyping up the G League as some kind of superior league and like Jaylen Green scoring 17 ppg is some amazing feat that will translate.  Jalen Green could *easily* end up a run of the mill 15 ppg mediocre scorer in the NBA.  Easily.  Yes there is upside, but his floor is pretty low."
"Carsen Edwards, a lifetime Chipotle card, and 2 2nds to get this fuck off my team.  Might throw in TT and/or Tremont Waters depending on if we get a full bag of chips and an uneaten soft serve back."
"And probably even worse all those 1st round picks. You gotta trade those unless it‚Äôs from a bottom dwelling team. Otherwise you just end up with Gershon Yabusele, grant Williams, tremont waters, etc. Hoarding post lottery FRPs is overrated"
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn‚Äôt move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn‚Äôt move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That‚Äôs a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn‚Äôt work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
"7.4% of his 2 point FGs were assisted. That‚Äôs second lowest in the league behind none other than Tremont Waters. That‚Äôs crazy. Luka is 9.5% and Donovan Mitchell 15% for comparison. Statistically, he‚Äôs better at getting his own shot than Luka. Maybe not in reality, but that‚Äôs still impressive. I put his trade value incredibly high, probably close to what OKC fans think."
Tremont waters
Pshhhh porzigis is more washed than my dads car  Ayton for Tremont ‚ÄúCP3 but can shoot‚Äù Waters
"I think everyone can dunk but the reason you see some guys never do it in game is because  1. It‚Äôs way harder if someone‚Äôs trying to contest you, especially if you‚Äôre a small guy  2. Fatigue might literally stop the shorter guys like Tremont Waters or JJ Barea from being able to at the end of games and nobody in the NBA is trying to get embarrassed being blocked by the rim on tv, I wouldn‚Äôt even chance that.  3. It‚Äôs really bad for your knees the higher you get off the ground, since the impact on landing is what does all the damage. Old guys like Chris Paul are never out here dunking regularly even if they can because it‚Äôs a great way to shorten your career after your body has already taken that toll."
tremont waters
"As an honest Mavericks fan I‚Äôm taking Jaylen Brown over Luka any day of the week. It‚Äôs sad to admit but Luka just is not that guy pal. As someone who‚Äôs absolutely watched all of his games I feel Luka‚Äôs just not good enough, especially in the playoffs. Luka is honestly not good in anyway. In fact, as a Mavs fan I‚Äôd trade him for a player with heart, like Tremont Waters!"
"Yeah he‚Äôs definitely a small 6‚Äô3, really lanky, but he‚Äôs still only 20 and will grow into his body. Definitely a better chance to turn into something then Carsen Edwards or Tremont Waters, the 5‚Äô6 boys."
"Tremont waters for Simmons, take it or leave it"
"Carsen Edwards is not a PG, he‚Äôs an undersized two.   Tremont Waters may actually have had a touch of IT optimism, but he was an end of draft flyer.   Pritchard is 6‚Äô1, would not say he‚Äôs undersized. Plenty of PG‚Äôs smaller than him. He‚Äôs a stud too, and a good defender. Really nothing at all like IT - plays more like a shorter Brogdon."
We‚Äôll give you Grant Williams and Tremont Waters for him
Simmons has been a scrub/bum lately on this sub after Game 5 heck many would take Tremont Waters over Simmons at this point
"You clearly don‚Äôt watch the Celtics. Al Horford hasn‚Äôt been on our team for two seasons. Romeo played in 11 games that Jaylen did, Rob Williams played low minutes until the trade deadline and then got injured not too long after.   Our defense as a whole sucked and we had 37 different starting lineups. It‚Äôs very hard to build defensive chemistry and defensive mistakes all around become more frequent when you‚Äôre starting guys like Tremont Waters, Javonte Greene, Grant Williams, Semi, Wagner, Carsen Edwards, and Kornet.  He‚Äôs been a good defender in a higher stakes setting of the playoffs. In the last two years he‚Äôs had a better dbpm than Steph, Capela, Paul George, Gobert, Middleton, and Klay. He had more defensive wins last year than Butler or Bam despite playing fewer minutes and games. Jaylen has flaws on defense but I think you‚Äôre going too far."
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
"Nice, here's a table with the top three category leaders.  |**Player**|**PPG**| |:--|--:| |Cam Thomas|27.0| |Tyrese Maxey|26.0| |Desmond Bane|24.0|  |**Player**|**REB**| |:--|--:| |Jalen Smith|12.5| |Paul Reed|12.0| |John Konchar|12.0|  |**Player**|**AST**| |:--|--:| |Payton Pritchard|8.5| |Immanuel Quickley|7.8| |Sharife Cooper|7.3|  |**Player**|**BLK**| |:--|--:| |Daniel Oturu|3.3| |Alperen Sengun|3.0| |Sekou Doumbouya|3.0|  |**Player**|**STL**| |:--|--:| |Tremont Waters|3.5| |Jordan Goodwin|3.3| |Louis King|3.2|"
"We added Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Dennis Schroder to a team that didn't have a bench and was *constantly* injured last year, while losing Fournier (who played sixteen games for us) and Kemba (who played 43 games for us and wasn't very good even when he *did* play). Seriously, I cannot stress how poor our bench was, and how much more our rotation was impacted by injury and COVID‚Äî Jeff Teague, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters started a combined **17** games for us."
"Horford is an upgrade over Thompson in every single facet of the game except offensive rebounding and immediately adds playmaking to the offensive mix, which was by far the team's largest issue last year.    Losing Kemba and Fournier hurts scoring in theory, but in reality they both missed like half of all possible games anyway, and both were heavily restricted (Kemba's knee, or Fournier by COVID) in a major chunk of the games they actually did play.  Neither were significant or consistent contributors last year, so their departures are ultimately a wash.  Richardson and Schroder aren't great players, but should be able to provide reasonable approximations of the actual offensive production we got out of those two even if they don't match what we had originally hoped for out of Kemba/Evan.  Kanter is also a solid third center and change of pace option, significantly better than Kornet/Tacko.  Pritchard/Nesmith had to rush into the season without summer league or much in the way of camps.  This was particularly rough on Nesmith who hadn't seen game action in close to a full calendar year by the time the season started due to sitting out the back half of his sophomore year at Vandy.  He finished off the year orders of magnitude better than he started, and there is no real reason to suspect he won't carry that development into this year.  The team (outside of maybe Schroder) is vaccinated.  We were either the hardest hit or one of the hardest hit teams by COVID last year and, when you only have about 8 actual NBA quality players on the roster, having multiple inactives every single night really fucks with you in a number of ways.  Simply having more consistent availability, along with replacing the flotsam at the end of the roster with a few more NBA level guys, should help the team significantly.  Like you can only do so much when you have to play Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters non-garbage time minutes.  Kris Dunn might not be that good, but it's almost impossible to imagine that he would be worse as at that emergency PG spot than Carsen.  This roster makes a lot more sense than last year's.  There should be better role clarity, better depth, and better continuity between the starting lineup and bench.  Jayson is probably not going to miss half a month or play through lingering COVID deficiencies, and the same for Jaylen with his wrist/knee.  The starting lineup will probably play more than 110 minutes together over the entire season.  There is a ton of recency bias out there because the team was not very active in free agency and people think dramatic flurries of moves to be the only way a team can improve, but tbh last season was so disastrous that simply having players actually playing games should lead to some baseline improvement."
No. Tremont Waters was just rookie of the year in the G League two years ago (the most recent full season) and tore it up with an 18/7.5 and 2 steals. He fucking sucks and will never amount to anything in the NBA.   The G League is still awful basketball. It‚Äôs hero ball where everybody is out for themselves. It‚Äôs not real team basketball.
Lebron could beat Tremont Waters &amp; Carson Edwards.
"Yeah Avery Bradley, Tremont Waters, etc."
"Seems one of our biggest flaws last years was just very few playmakers on the team. It didn‚Äôt help that Kemba was getting screwed by his bad injury luck, so some games we were starting Teague or Tremont Waters.  Then with the second unit, we pretty much had to play both Kemba and Jaylen when Jayson sat because it got real ugly. I would love Schroder on the team, him not being a great three point shooter may hurt some of the fit, but if you watched the team last year you‚Äôd know how much we need more ball handlers.  Payton and JRich to your point would be a cool second unit. I think they fit very well together too."
I remember Tremont Waters was cookin the fuck out of Sato one game this past season
I had to watch Tremont Waters
Clearly you‚Äôve never seen the dynamic duo of Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters running the show for us
I watched 5‚Äô10 (my height) Tremont Waters miss like 8 shots in a row in a garbage time Celtics game and it made me feel awful lol.
"Tremont Waters, who will not be retained by the Celtics is probably worth being on this list."
"Ben Simmons for Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye and our 45th pick this year. We can also add Grant Williams if they ask for more."
"&gt;undersized guards   You mean Tremont Waters and Carsen Edwards?  Those guys were 2nd round picks and that's kind of my point.  His record is fine if you look at the draft picks he was working with, sure he missed a couple of guys but there are teams that don't hit 40-50% on top 5 picks, let alone 14-60th picks.  He was 100% on top 10 picks over his career and about 40-50% on 15-30s. That's a really good hit rate for a GM."
"Bunch of rookies, sophomore and 3rd year player on our bench last season. Now we have a decent bench. Semi Ojeleye, Recovering Langford, Rookie Neismith, Sophomore Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters (both under 6 feet), Jabari Parker, Washed TT, White guy from the bulls and Tacko Fall. Oh I forgot Kemba in and out Walker. Did you even know those guys? Lmfaoo"
"In terms of official listed weight (in other words, don't @ me about Oliver Miller, Eddy Curry, Tractor Traylor, etc.), the greatest disparity between two teammates that I can find is Sim Bhullar at 360 lbs. and Darren Collison at 175 lbs., a difference of 185 lbs. (Though David Stockton played on the Kings in 2015, Bhullar was sent down as Stockton was brought up.)  Other instances of one teammate weighing about double another (only one listed per player) include, but are not limited to:  * Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Melchioni (310 lbs. and 165 lbs.) * Thomas Hamilton (330 lbs.) and Dee Brown (160 lbs.) * Gheorghe Muresan (303 lbs.) and Greg Grant (140 lbs.) * Yao Ming (311 lbs.) and John Lucas III (166 lbs.) * Shaquille O'Neal (325 lbs.) and Steve Kerr &amp; Kenny Smith (170 lbs.) \[Shaq and Sebastian Telfair, 165, were in the same trade, making them the biggest disparity in a trade.\] * Garth Joseph (315 lbs.) and Muggsy Bogues (136 lbs.) * For the last 2 seasons, the greatest disparity was Tacko Fall (311 lbs.) and Tremont Waters (136 lbs.) * Oliver Miller (280 lbs.) and Elliot Perry (150 lbs.) * Mike Peplowski (270 lbs.) and Spud Webb (133 lbs.)"
"Could I recommend a 5'10"" Tremont Waters?"
Are the Bucks playing Tremont Waters? We‚Äôre down bad rn lol
"Sandro Mamukaleshvili probably should have a full roster spot, while Giorgios Kalaitzakis probably should be the guy on a two way, but it is the opposite right now.  Bucks probably leaving final roster spot open and so Mamu is stuck on a two way.  Kalaitzakis may be able to defend decently, but doesn't bring much offense.  Sandro really can play, but may lack defense/athleticism.  Justin Robinson probably most deserving of the second two-way, not sure if he will get it.  But he looks better than Tremont Waters to me."

Is it just me or has Tremont Waters looked *really* good?
Tremont Waters?
what's steve nash's gameplan to stop tremont waters
"It's very funny to be fair; I can't imagine they'll be on the court very long. That said I can't tell what's more disrespectful; bringing out KD and Harden to play this line-up, or starting Tremont Waters against the Nets."
"Tremont Waters, I guess"
"Schroder was a Brad Stevens move, but Danny also drafted people like Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, and Payton Pritchard to fill in the holes. Pritchard has looked promising at least, but seems to have a short leash with Ime."
"It's not that they choose to play hero ball it's that they don't have the ability to play anything else. Tatum is not good enough to be the main ball handler yet, but they have no other options. Smart is the best passer on the team, but he is so inconsistent at scoring that having him be the main ball handler would just give you bad shots from Smart instead. Brown is a terrible ball handler. His handles while improving aren't anything to write home about, his court vision is worse than Tatum's and his passing ability is also worse. Dennis is decent at it, but not a long term solution. Their best catch and shoot player from 3 is also their best ball handler.   It's why losing Kemba and Hayward were so devastating for the team. Hayward especially was a good ball handler that just filled in the holes for the Celtics. Kemba's knees turned to jelly towards the end, but his first season with the Celtics showed what the team should look like. Danny Ainge tried to fill this hole with a ton of picks like Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, and Payton Pritchard. Pritchard shows promise, but he's 2 years away from being 2 years away. They really need a passing pg who can keep defenses honest or get downhill like Lonzo or DJ Murray."
"You may have to add Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters to make the contracts match, but we can get it done."
