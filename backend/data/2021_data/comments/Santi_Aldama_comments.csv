Get ready for Santi Aldama!     (Only half joking)

"1. The Grizzlies took on bad salary (Bledsoe) for a future first, and moved up in the draft plus got Adams for JV.     That's a perfect trade for a team like the Grizzlies who aren't going to make a splash in free agency but have a good track record in recent years of drafting well - particularly late in the draft. They got value back for JV (who himself was value for Marc Gasol at 34 years old) who didn't fit the team's style, age or cap situation (he's, slow, clogs the paint, 28 and an expiring contract). They can play Adams less than JV, and he does most of what we relied on JV to do. Set screens and rebound.    2. We also traded Allen for 2 seconds   He's in a contract year and creates a log jam at SG.  3. Drafted Ziaire Williams and Santi Aldama.  I won't throw who we drafted into the discussion as all rookies have bust potential, so it isn't really fair to judge who teams drafted."
Not strange once you see your rookies Santi Aldama and Ziaire Williams.
"This probably means Bane and Melton will be used more. I wish we got a future first round pick for him but considering how many picks we gave for Santi Aldama, this is not bad either. But we could have gotten a better return. We also have a huge back log when it comes to SG so trading him does clear that up.   I like Grayson. He did a lot for us. But we were not gonna pay him. I hope the best for him with Milwaukee as they won this trade.  But who's Sam Merrill?"
"Also Santi Aldama, etc. Spain will always have at least a competitive team. Basketball is too engrained and popular there. They haven't have a real crisis since the 1970s."
Don’t sleep on Santi Aldama.
"Sad Jontay couldn’t work out, but his injuries were always thought to be pretty debilitating, even more so probably than what MPJ dealt with. There could easily be more at play there too, but, like, there’s no reason for the Grizz to have Jontay, Killian Tillie, and now Santi Aldama more or less completely overlapping when none of them are playing meaningful minutes hopefully  I won’t be surprised if he pops up as being certified good sometime in his 20s if his health ever lets him get back on the path he was heading though. Hope the best for him and happy we got the first crack at him"
"I have watched a lot of the Aldama in college and he reminds me of Evan Mobley. The bigs in the Pac-12 weren't really impressive this year (tbh the pac-12 in general was a guard-heavy conference this year)   I think in terms of value, Santi was a perfect fit for Memphis"
"ESPN draft analysis, what does this word salad even mean? Doesn’t want to play or did the Grizzlies hoodwink everybody?:  “Utah traded this pick to Memphis as part of an undisclosed package. They surprised many around the league by selecting Santi Aldama from Loyola (MD). Aldama made a name for himself on the international FIBA circuit playing for the Spanish national team, winning the U18 European Championship in 2019 and being named MVP of the tournament. Aldama had a mysterious draft process, not conducting any publicly known workouts with NBA teams and electing to decline an invitation to the NBA draft combine, citing a desire to ""continue his career in Spain."" He openly discouraged teams from selecting him, going as far as to turn down Zoom interviews after returning to his home country.  Most NBA teams assumed he received some type of assurance that he'll be drafted (a ""promise"") or will receive a two-way contract after going undrafted, and hearing his name called Thursday likely confirms that he was shut down by Memphis several months ago, likely much higher than what they thought they needed to when they made the promise.”"

Santi Aldama probably
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
"Mainly Garuba and Santi Aldama, Javi García had some good games too but he didn't get a lot of playtime this year in ACB"
Josh Primo will be Caris Levert level of impact   Tre Mann will be an all star level player    Bones Hyland is going to be at least a 15 ppg scorer in the league. I genuinely think you take him top 20 and wouldn’t be mad at anyone in the back half of the lotto   Jeremiah Robinson Earl will slip and be such an immediate impact people will be like how could we let another villanova guy slip.   I agree with your Santi Aldama pick but I’m going to one up it and say Sandro Mamukelishvili is going to be an impact offensive player off the bench immediately. The guy is an NBA player hands down. He’s Bobby Portis with slightly more playmaking flare
"Grizzlies could trade Rondo, Juancho, Culver and Anderson for Simmons after 16 October.  I'd toss Santi Aldama in there too."
"And two pick swaps, which became Ziaire Williams and Santi Aldama"

Santi Aldama. He's shown his bag this preseason while also looking out of place and selfish at time. He projects to be versatile on offense but a turnstile on defense(he's more mobile than i thought seeing him so far)
"He still picked up 5 fouls against a team that is unbelievably bad at drawing them.   Also, I have no idea why Santi Aldama is now ahead of Xavier Tillman in the rotation."
"We're very sneaky with trading into the late 1st.  Did it again this past draft with Santi Aldama.  Now, it's way too early to tell if that pick was a winner, but it's smart thinking.  And we clearly liked him and were targeting him to some extent.  He shut down his pre-draft workouts early so probably got a promise from us at some point."
