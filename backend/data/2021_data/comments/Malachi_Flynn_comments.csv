Malachi Flynn snubbed
Didn‚Äôt y‚Äôall throw a month long fit because people were talking about lamelo instead of Malachi Flynn
You‚Äôre a fucking clown and lebron will always own the craptors also Malachi Flynn sucks lamelo‚Äôs tip get fucked
that was 100% my reaction. i wanted them to pick Malachi Flynn. this is why i'm not a scout.
"The Raps got Malachi Flynn, why would he need to defend this take?"
Malachi Flynn played really well in his pre-season debut while Lamelo scored 0 points. This resulted in Raptors fans clowning Lamelo and calling him a bust.
MALACHI FLYNN THO LMFMAOF
ROTYNNMF  (Rookie Of The Year Not Named Malachi Flynn)
"""Fuck Malachi Flynn"" was so obviously a joke and you're down here getting all defensive. Stay Me2o my friend"
Ok but is Malachi Flynn better than Lamelo Ball?
Fuck you Malachi Flynn
MY ROOKIE OF THE YEAR  Malachi Flynn better tho
So are raptors fans still crying about Lamelo Ball getting more media coverage than malachi flynn?
I‚Äôm just here for the Sam Merrill-Malachi Flynn rematch tbh
"Not really. Nephews in our sub keep pretending like Matt Thomas is Steph Curry and Malachi Flynn is Trae Young and Nurse is throwing games by not putting them in, but the reality is that this roster just has very little to actually work with."
"You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Just look at this past two years: Ja Morant, Dylan Windler, Jarrell Brantley, Justin Wright-Foreman, Miye Oni, Malachi Flynn, Jay Scrubb, Grant Miller, Sam Merrill, all from mid-major at best programs. If Seth couldn't get enough attention at Duke University that's his own fault."
Honestly I prefer malachi flynn
Yes. I really like Malachi but he is not getting consistent minutes. If the rookie is just gonna be on the bench anyway I would rather have the high ceiling project of Mcdaniels instead of Flynn who is older
"Team: Raptors  Rookie: Malachi Flynn  How have they looked: he's not the chosen one or anything our fanbase was hyping him up to be in preseason, but he has shown solid defense. He needs more confidence shooting the ball, but he hasn't taken any dumb shots, much of his shots are a matter of make or miss.  His biggest disadvantage is his size"
You tell em fam üòÇüòÇ #lakeshow runs LA üü°üü£ King THT &gt; Overrated Malachi Flynn any day üò§üò§ I will not rest until Pat Bev receives the death penalty üíÄüíÄ
Yessss a few possessions of Malachi Flynn coming on up
"I don't think that anyone really thought Malachi Flynn was going to look this bad with the Raptors, even early on in the season.   His struggles have been a real surprise, kind of like Aaron Nesmith not being able to buy a 3 pointer."
Malachi Flynn future all star just gotta get that FG% above 30 first.
Where‚Äôs malachi Flynn?
"3 team trade (assuming Lowry wants out):  Tor: Harden, AD, Kyrie Irving  Nets: Lowry  Lakers: Malachi Flynn + Terrance Davis + three 2nd round picks"
Malachi Flynn aka Red VanVleet
Malachi Flynn &gt; Lamelo Ball
Malachi Flynn
"I dont know yall, did Lamelo prove he was better than Malachi Flynn yet"
"my boy Malachi Flynn could do that any day of the week, probably in his sleep   ^^^^^^/s"
But what about Malachi Flynn??  You‚Äôre judging him based on one game. Lamelo will be a stud.
Malachi flynn tho   Sorry I had to do it to ya
is malachi flynn better then lemelo yet ü§£
Malachi Flynn Revenge SZN üòàüòàüòà Lamelo ‚Äú22/11/12‚Äù Ball who??
Malachi flynn being compared to MJ
"Relax. The Kings have handed out more historical records and career highs to opponents than any team in the League. I loled a few games ago when they played the Raptors and our broadcast crew mentioned how Malachi Flynn was scoreless in the league so far, and suddenly drops 12 on us."
"1. We've blown a lot of double-digit leads.  2. At the start of the season Siakam struggled a lot.  He's playing way better now, and although it hasn't translated to wins, the team (at least the starting lineup) is looking better.  3. We have big problems at centre.  Ibaka and Gasol left which has had a huge impact, Baynes and Len have been hot garbage and borderline unplayable, Chris Boucher has been very good but he isn't really a true 5.  4. We have no bench.  Norm Powell has struggled a lot (wild shooting splits of 43% on 3PAs and 31% on 2PAs), Boucher has been good off of the bench but if Baynes and Len are this bad then you might need to start Boucher.  Nick Nurse has Terence Davis and Matt Thomas (especially Matt Thomas) on super short leashes, I'm assuming because of defense, which means they're barely playing.  Malachi Flynn has only seen real minutes in three games, two of which he didn't do much and one which he played well.  TLDR: Stanley Johnson is getting consistent rotation minutes, which should tell you all you need to know about the Raptors rotation problems at the moment."
Because nick nurse doesn‚Äôt give Malachi Flynn minutes
Can someone explain the Malachi Flynn meme?
Is Luka better or worse than Malachi Flynn? Too soon to tell imo
"This post confirms that Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and Malachi Flynn will all win MVP's"
"Raptors clearly need a C, and it's starting to look like having Terence Davis, Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas around is a little redundant, so... what kind of a centre can one or two of them buy?"
Just say you‚Äôre upset and go. You giving me Malachi Flynn energy.
"Yea the NBA has pretty good players. The future looks really good too, with Tatum, Zion, Trae, Malachi Flynn, and Luka as possible faces of the league."
Just wait until the Raps fully unleash ROY Malachi Flynn.  Whole league fucked
"throw in Malachi ""Better than Lamelo"" Flynn and it's a done deal!"
But is he as good as Malachi Flynn?
Yeah I mean yall are fine anyways with Malachi Flynn
"I'm not saying Malachi Flynn is better than LaMelo. That would be unreasonable; borderline insane. But, Matt Thomas might be."
"I don‚Äôt want to be this guy, but someone has to say it for this sub‚Äôs sake:   Pre-season Malachi Flynn"
Malachi Flynn could easily do this if he got lamelo minutes smh
"I was thinking that the whole Malachi Flynn thing was being overblown because I was in that game thread when it was happening...   But then I just so happened to look at their sub today and they had like 5 upvoted posts dedicated to that topic...  So... Sorry Raptors fans, no remorse..."
"Smh, scoreless Lamelo could never compare to preseason GOAT Malachi Flynn."
The real question for Raptors fans is: Who do you think will be the better player between Malachi Flynn and Lamelo?
we disrespected the goat MALACHI FLYNN
Can we not use this to shit on Zo.. let‚Äôs just talk ab how great Melo has been. Did nobody learn from the Malachi Flynn bs
Yeah but how come you're not talking about Malachi Flynn?
"LaMelo ""Malachi Flynn"" Ball"
malachi flynn could never
Malachi Flynn been hooping though.
"Lamelo Good, Malachi Flynn was in fact not better than him. The more you know üëçüèæ"
Not if Malachi Flynn has anything to say about it
Fuck can‚Äôt believe we took this bum over Malachi Flynn
God fuck can‚Äôt believe we took this guy over malachi flynn
But have you heard of Malachi Flynn
"Malachi Flynn tho, he way better"
Sorry but Malachi Flynn &gt; Lamelo ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù Ball
But what about Malachi Flynn???
Malachi flynn would never
Hey Raptors fans how is Malachi Flynn doing?
Malachi Flynn tho
Malachi Flynn better???
Yeh but guys....Malachi Flynn though.
Lol relax. He's no Malachi Flynn   /s
"They had us in the first quarter, not gonna lie lmao. Kings couldn't miss to start the game, got open layups and threes whenever they wanted, and nearly put up 50 in a quarter. Haliburton is not a fucking rookie out there; he has the poise and composure of a seasoned vet, and creates so many good looks for his teammates.   However, Raps hunkered down defensively once they subbed out the corpse of Alex Len for Boucher, and ran with their length and athleticism. The bench finally had a great game, moving the ball and spacing the floor, with Siakam generating a ton of good looks with his improved passing out of double teams and the post. Malachi Flynn continues to earn more minutes with his play on both ends, and he's gaining more and more rhythm and confidence with each passing game. This was a great preview into a future Raptors backcourt post-Lowry, with FVV bombing away from deep and converting tough finishes at the rim, and Malachi orchestrating the P/R with great passing reads!   The first feel-good win of the season for the Raps, hopefully they can build off this and return to their winning ways!"
Malachi Flynn 11-11 game inbound
Malachi Flynn no doubt next MJ
Don‚Äôt ever disrespect Malachi Flynn like that ever again r/NBA
Malachi Flynn better than Haliburton Flynn better than lamelo not a hot take
Malachi Flynn is gonna be real good
Malachi Flynn heard y‚Äôall talking SHIT  And now he‚Äôs coming for that ass
Malachi Flynn heard r/nba talking shit!!!
This kid Haliburton might be better than Malachi Flynn.
How many points did Malachi Flynn score?
"Exactly!  Why were Raps fans getting so worked up about Lamelo Ball v Malachi Flynn in the pre-season? They aren't even really comparable, but since the Raps have had some diamonds in the rough before, some fans got excited and loud when Flynn was outperforming Lamelo in the pre-season games.  It was lame."
Yup. There's a reason this post is about Malachi Flynn and not Talen Horton Tucker or which ever rookie that popped in preseason. Everyone else was memeing about their rookies or at some semblance of self awareness.
I never once thought Malachi Flynn was better than LaGOAT Ball. LaGOAT Ball is the best player in his draft class.

Malachi Flynn better than both bro didn't you see that steal he got in the preseason against Lamelo?  Open and shut case since then.
Do you think this Ball guy is better than Malachi Flynn yet?
Freds our best player so far. The poverty version would be Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas
Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas &gt; Splash bros
malachi flynn - micheal jordan
Where Malachi Flynn at?
"Before the draft I had my own little board and I had prichard 14, flynn 16, and maxey 29. Now that I've seen maxey play, I can honestly say I would've had him higher if I knew what I know now. I'm not sure though. I think prichard is the best player right now, maxey has the most potential, and malachi is probably better than maxey but doesn't have the upside. Maybe I'm biased but after seeing maxey play I think he'll end up the best player. He's insanely talented on ball, like I thought he was gonna be more malik monk with daron foxes jumper but he's way further along as a lead guard/playmaker than I thought. I wouldn't trade maxey for those guys. For what it's worth maxey kinda showed up prichard in preseason."
Malachi Flynn trick y'all
"   So on January 4th 2020, after not being in the lineup for the second straight game, Malachi Flynn decided he had enough. He famously wrote two key phrases on the clubhouse bulletin board; ‚Äúplay for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúthe ship is sinking.‚Äù  Word traveled quickly of the remarks in the clubhouse and Nick Nurse promptly called a closed-door meeting with the team. It got to the point where Nurse was so irate that he stood up and challenged Flynn to a fight."
Didn't think the Raps were gonna actually tie it but I thought it was funny to see Tatum and Brown get put back in to guard Malachi Flynn and Yuta Watanabe
"Malachi Flynn has to know, if you take the asshole shot at the end of the game you better make it, otherwise you just look like an idiot lol"
Fuck yeah there‚Äôs Malachi Flynn getting the respect he deserved on the court üò§üò§
Fucking bullshit! It should have been Malachi Flynn!
but malachi flynn right
"While I like Malachi Flynn, it sucks seeing players I was also high on do really well for other teams like Theo, Cole Anthony, Zeke Nnaji."
"none of this changes the fact that Lin looked confused, disoriented and overwhelmed trying to run the Raptors offense.  Bottom line is, Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry are much smarter point guards than Lin.    I don't care how many years Lin spent in Harvard.  Lowry and VanVleet are much smarter.  Mr. Lin, please enjoy your time in the G-League getting roasted by such elite floor generals as Malachi Flynn."
Can he rebound or block shots?  The *most* I'd do is Terence Davis (or Malachi Flynn) plus 1st Rd pick and filler (but I'd be more comfortable with the pick being a 2nd rounder).
Malachi Flynn who‚Äôs scored a total of 30 points and dished 11 assists? That‚Äôs not even as good as Maxey‚Äôs best game.
Malachi Flynn lmao
? Terrence Davis has shown more potential as a 2 way guard. More efficient as well.  Malachi Flynn has shown he‚Äôs a more capable passer/defender
"How tf is Smell-o LaMello a Rising Star but Malachi ""Win"" Flynn isnt? /s"
"You can go through the past 7 or 8 drafts and it's astounding how many seconds and late firsts the Celtics blew on terrible players, with many better players taken in the picks after.  &gt;Not everyone can be a genius drafter and get guys like Malachi Flyn / Jalen Harris / Dewan hernandez.  What's the point of this? The last two guys were both taken 59th. Flynn does appear to be a bad pick, I will agree with that."
This is as bad as the shit trades they're saying we'd take for Lowry. They don't want Powell and Baynes.     They want one of Terence Davis/Matt Thomas/Malachi Flynn and one of Matisse Thybulle or Tyrone Maxey. They also want a FRP or potentially two FRP's. Maybe even a second. Maybe even a swap.
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
"I think as a tool for players who are almost ready and aren't interested in a diminished college experience (right now) the G league is amazing. Guys can work in a pro system, on an NBA size court with full grown men, and hone their skills or develop them.   The G-league isn't going to explode in popularity, but it would be wrong of me to say that without the Raps 905 the Toronto Raptors wouldn't be the same team they are today. Fred, Pascal and Boucher all got into the bench by lighting up the G-league.  Teams just don't know how to use it right, yet.   Malachi flynn played 3 games in 2 days last week cause he was with the 905 then flew to Milwaukee, him getting 30+ minutes  with the 905 allows him to properly develop while Kyle and FVV are still the main guys. It allows players to be blooded without straight up tanking."
At least they still have Malachi Flynn
"There‚Äôs gonna be riots in the streets of Toronto when they find out Chris Boucher is older than Andre Drummond, Pascal is older than Wiggins and Julius Randle. There‚Äôs gonna be real carnage when they find out Malachi flynn is the same age as Jayson Tatum"
"They also think every young player on their team is an allstar or mvp. Og Anunoby is Kawhi, pascal is Kawhi, Malachi Flynn is fred VanVleet 2.0 Chris Boucher is a future allstar. They‚Äôre horrible at evaluating their guys"
"Malachi Flynn has looked really nervous. He‚Äôs got good movement, makes some strong reads on his passes and gets great shot opportunities but has a case of the yips I think. We sent him to the Gubble and he‚Äôs been dominant (with a couple inefficient games).   Not ready for regular rotation minutes on a playoff team just yet, but his game is just so solid in all areas that you know he‚Äôs going to be a great contributor long term. Could probably stand to put on a few pounds to unlock his impressive defensive instincts as well.   In games I‚Äôve caught of other rookies, Pritchard, Haliburton and Cole Anthony have stuck out as out-hitting their draft hype/position. I‚Äôve thought that A1 was actually quite underwhelming except for that one time he devoured my team‚Äôs soul."
certainly didn't look like it. Malachi Flynn had one similar for Raps that wasnt counted
malachi flynn is better than THT
"G-league is not an insult for the Raptors honestly. Siakam and FVV are leaders of this franchise moving forward and they all won a g-league title. Adds credibility to the process, imagine Malachi Flynn hearing stories of FVV in the g-league and seeing all the shit he accomplished afterwards, if that's not encouraging idk what is."
malachi flynn: 10 time mvp along with 18 championships
Ex-fucking-cuse me are you implying I'm delusional for thinking Malachi Flynn will be finals MVP next year? Downvoted.
Malachi Flynn called up to play? Am I seeing this properly  edit: and matt thomas? holy shiznits!
Idk man I think he might be able to take Facundo Campazzo or Malachi Flynn.
He was the Malachi Flynn to Cash Considerations‚Äô LaMelo Ball
You misspelled Malachi Flynn
"Naw you got Malachi Flynn. You‚Äôll see him, soon enough"
"""I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,"" says the LORD Almighty.  -Malachi 3:1  little did we know it was Malachi Flynn the whole time"
"Yeah, the Bulls should pass on Lonzo and try to get Malachi Flynn, I hear he's a superstar in the making."
Malachi Flynn.
"Tough to say, it‚Äôs pretty likely Lowry is leaving, so that leaves Vanvleet as the starting PG, and while we do have plenty of guards, Terence Davis, Bembry, and Malachi Flynn aren‚Äôt really starters yet. So I do see them holding onto Powell for at least another season or two."
"Agreed, with obvious exceptions like Luka, Giannis, Malachi Flynn, etc."
Payton Pritchard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Malachi Flynn btw
"Damn bro Malachi Flynn went 4-16, how tf did he kill us in pre season. Nvm I forgot we just gave the jazz and grizzlies a franchise best in 3‚Äôs."
This sub was really saying Malachi Flynn was better
Remember when r/nba was talking about Malachi Flynn being better than him
remember malachi flynn?
It turns out that he might be a bit better than Malachi Flynn
Lol if Malachi Flynn started bro
Something something Malachi Flynn
We were saying Malachi Flynn &gt; LaMelo Ball unironically after 2 preseason games as well.
He no Malachi Flynn
fuck me why didnt we take malachi flynn
Idk Malachi Flynn tho
"I remember a YouTube video  being like 17 minutes basically saying Malachi Flynn was better than Lemelo Ball after one pre-season game.  I'm a Raps fan, but we can be way too pretentious."

THT vs Malachi Flynn the battle of the preseason kings
Malachi Flynn is garbage sheesh
"God I miss Malachi Flynn, he wouldn‚Äôt have let us get dominated by Syracuse like that"
Malachi Flynn???
"If we were tanking, Malachi Flynn wouldn't be playing 30+ mins.    The Play-In Tourney runs through Tampa!"
Don't forget Malachi Flynn.
Do you think if lamelo wasn't hurt he could steal the rookie of the year title from malachi flynn?
"Arm extension offensive fouls get called all the time lmao, Malachi Flynn got two in this game alone."
Malachi Flynn got a post for a similar game right after
Malachi flynn
"Malachi Flynn, Paul Watson, STANIMAL, Yuta Watanabe, Aaron Baynes"
Malachi Flynn (better than LaMelo)
"I don't know who ~~Angola~~the Warriors are, but they in trouble.  ~~Charles Barkley~~Malachi Flynn"
"Malachi ""Moses"" Flynn"
Is GTJ the new Malachi Flynn??
Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn winning a game by 60 while lamelo is sitting around doing nothing   Raptors fans were right all along
Malachi Flynn today: 16 points. Lamelo ball today: 0 points. enough said.
"It's true, Malachi ""the human tank"" Flynn is still on the floor."
malachi flynn is +41 in 22 minutes... bruhhhh
"Yup. Get GTJ his first win, raise morale a bit on the team but still commit to the tank (esp if Malachi Flynn is going to be our starting PG for a bit)"
I think he‚Äôs better than Suggs for sure. Would not be surprised to see him as the best from this draft. It‚Äôs hard to measure talent in the G-league though for example Malachi Flynn has been terrible in the NBA but looked like a god paying for the 905
"- Baynes couldn‚Äôt score on a hooker and he can‚Äôt guard a cripple.   - Bad Rebounding + inefficient offensive production aren‚Äôt a good combo.  - Fred can‚Äôt run an offence to save his life and plays hero ball too much.   - Malachi Flynn is having one of the worst rookie seasons for our team in recent memory.   - COVID hit us as soon as we found our rhythm and screwed everything up.   Theres more to it, but that about sums it up."
When the time is right Malachi Flynn will get major minutes and a green light to work on his 3pt shooting.
tonight Maledon will OWN malachi flynn
What does Malachi Flynn have to say about this??
"Two reasons. First, the draft really is less predictable than you think and even if you try to simplify things and go ""let's throw upside out the window and just go after someone who's ready to contribute from day one"" you're not going to identify those players with 100 percent accuracy; Malachi Flynn and Grant Riller also had a lot of people talking up how NBA-ready they were going to be.  Secondly, being able to help in the postseason when rotations are tighter and everyone's read the scouting report on you is a higher bar and contending teams can make better use of their prospects/picks than just acquiring a competent enough bench guy. Let's pretend Bane was drafted #15 or wherever you think he deserved to go: would it be better for a team like the Nuggets to have used #24 and a future 1st to move up and get Bane, or to get Aaron Gordon at the trade deadline?"
Good thing we skipped over him for Malachi Flynn who's even older than he is
Or the Raptors with Malachi Flynn!
Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn is not good.
Malachi Flynn shoots 19% from 3? That doesn't sound right
Earlier this year raptors fans were saying that Malachi Flynn was better than lamelo
MVP: Kyle Lowry  MIP: Chris Boucher  6MOTY: Chris Boucher  ROTY: Malachi Flynn I guess   DPOY: OG Anunoby
Is there a way to add a ‚Äúwins lost due to COVID‚Äù like we do injuries? Player days missed is important but Malachi Flynn missing days doesn‚Äôt have the impact that missing Siakam or Tatum does
I know Theo for sure. There is a debate in the Raptors sub about whether the FO messed up by drafting Malachi Flynn vs Theo Maledon.
Yeah he‚Äôs no Malachi Flynn
He's a Raptors fan. They thought that Malachi Flynn was better than Lamelo
"On top of missing Siakam, Fred and OG we're also missing Malachi Flynn and Patrick McCaw. Either of whom would be a BIG upgrade over some of these guys getting minutes."
Anyone else remember raptor fans talking shit about lamelo in the preseason and saying malachi Flynn is better üòÇ
"Oh yes the healthy Malachi Flynn, not the healthy Siakam, Vanvleet, or Anunoby"
With a healthy Malachi Flynn it would be a whole different game.
for hyping up a young player that's been giving us good minutes in the regular season?   and weren't y'all the ones talking crazy about malachi flynn after he had that meaningless good game against lamelo?
"Same, but yall were lucky that Malachi Flynn was out tonight."
Remember raptors fans were in their feelings because people were talking about lamelo over malachi flynn lmaooo
"Malachi Flynn would've stopped all of this, right?"
we're just all thankful that Malachi Flynn isn't playing
"I seem to remember quite a few people referring to him as ‚ÄúLmao Ball‚Äù for his first week or so in the league.   I saw one of our fellow fans downvoted in the negative hundreds right around the new year for simply stating that LaMelo was in the upper quartile of passers in the NBA.  There‚Äôs the famous ‚Äúhow is a prospect that that can‚Äôt shoot, can‚Äôt defend, has no handle, etc. be projected in the first round‚Äù (or whatever) post. The Malachi Flynn debacle.  We could probably pull up old threads for days. People hated this kid, called him a bust before he even played, clowned us for the pick and mocked Melo ruthlessly.  Now he was a no-brainer can‚Äôt-miss guy. Sure."
"OG Anunoby, Malachi Flynn 2 FRPs would be what I would picture as a reasonable offer although idk what LaVine‚Äôs contract looks like rn. Depends what direction the Bulls want to go in too."
LOL that's rich coming from a raptors fan  yall actually thought malachi flynn was better
"Zach Lavine‚Äôs doppelg√§ngers are coming out nowhere lol  Looks-wise? There‚Äôs Malachi Flynn.   Athleticism, play style, skills-wise? This kid Jalen Green."
he's no malachi flynn

"I think it was also to open up minutes for other guards like Flynn  As soon as he was traded, Malachi played every game"
He‚Äôs gonna become a Malachi Flynn level player one day
I'm still not sold on Malachi Flynn yet tbh. He had one very good month but that doesn't cancel out the fact that he looked like a poor man's Patrick McCaw for most of the season. I hope he maintains his current form.
"Lowry's definitely our best player and the team would be worse off without him, but the biggest issue with the roster is the lack of a starting-calibre centre when we have an excess of playable guards (Lowry, FVV, Norm Powell/Gary Trent Jr, even rookie of the month Malachi Flynn).  As long as keep one of Lowry and GTJ, getting a decent centre this off-season will go a long way. The fanbase is optimistic about a return to form next year--a long offseason, a return to Toronto, another year of development for Siakam/FVV/OG, half our guys recovering from Covid, and a high draft pick."
People still sleeping on Malachi Flynn üò§
"&gt;Why would the raptors take davion mitchell?  Because Malachi Flynn has to go back to his home planet, clearly."
Malachi Flynn?
Davis I get because he was actually good but Malachi Flynn is terrible
I‚Äôd say Malachi Flynn deserves a shoutout but most of the guys on here make it over him
&gt;2-way players are literally at end of the bench.  And then starters in the G league...  &gt;Guys that were All-G-League don‚Äôt even have rosters spots.  Uhhh what?  Moses Brown plays for OKC often   KPJ is a stud on Houston   Paul Reed plays for Philly   Malachi Flynn literally just won rookie of the week/month I forget   Mamadi Diakite has played 12 games for Milwaukee  Jordan Poole plays for golden state
malachi flynn's a thot. he's a freaking nasty hoe. he looks good. i'd love malachi flynn to bust my pussy open and tell me about lamelo ball's designs on the world. if a guy shows up with a fucking clenched jaw and a rookie of the month trophy he can hit my backwalls any fucking time of day dude. if a guy's like 'i got drafted in the first round because im really clutch' im like 'take a fucking caterpillar bulldozer to my pussy like its the west bank dude'.
Malachi Flynn top 10 name
"Honestly Malachi Flynn, his decision making is solid at a young age and he seems like a really good shooter as well. Been showing star potential in the last few games as a starter, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up being top 3-5 out of this class."

"He needs to get back, Malachi Flynn is gaining on him. Lol"
"This is true. Nick Nurse mentioned in an ideal season Malachi Flynn would have played in almost the entire g-league season for development. Instead he played in 6, was called up early due to injury concerns, and then got COVID. He's playing well and showing great signs of development with the main squad but I do wonder what a longer g-league season could have done for a lot of these prospects"
There's no incentive for Raps to give up Lowry. He and Freddie are mentoring Malachi Flynn and that's worth more than the shit assets you're trying to offload.
Malachi Flynn is so fundamentally sound everything he does just looks textbook
Duckin Malachi Flynn
"""I never charged you for that autograph""  - Blake Griffin to Malachi Flynn, probably."
Where were you when Malachi Flynn torched the 2021 nba champs Brooklyn Nets?
Malachi Flynn with 95 assists and only 28 turnovers for the season. For a rookie who has played limited minutes (until recently) thats pretty damn good. 27 steals too. Almost as many steals as turnovers.
I guess Malachi Flynn will have to settle for 2 then
This guy has a chance to be as good as Malachi Flynn
"I will never figure out why they didn't trade Lowry this year and try to get something for him. You're clearly not going anywhere and traded Norman Powell so you were already punting the season a little. Could have helped jump start to the next era of Raptors basketball.   I think the Siakam contract looks rough but if they can get a true #1 guy in there he's a great second fiddle, he's just miscast as having to be ""the dude."" Elsewhere there are some nice pieces like Anunoby still has room to grow and is already an elite defender. Guys like Boucher and Trent are solid young players who can contribute on a winning team. Malachi Flynn has show plenty of flashes in the past few weeks too.   I really don't think Toronto is too far off they have plenty of guys who can be great role players and a guy who can be the 2nd best player on at least a conference finals team. It's really just about trying to land a true superstar to complement all of that. Of course that's way easier said than done but if they can I don't hate a lot of pieces on this roster.   Oh and playing in their actual city will help too."
just here to say shoutout Malachi Flynn
I would take Malachi Flynn over Wiseman ngl
Malachi Flynn
If raptors make the play-inns we can get a rematch between LaMelo and Malachi Flynn
Bruh how is this even a debate... Malachi Flynn is easily better than lamelo and it isn't even close
Lol they also tried some weird shit about Malachi Flynn and lamelo because of pre season basketball
"Aight, imma sell all my Malachi Flynn stock, mfcker out there looking like ME."
One conference has Nicolo Melli and the other has Malachi Flynn.

Off-Brand Malachi Flynn
Off-Brand Malachi Flynn
"Read his second para. We aren't trying to win, but we aren't trying to lose, either. We aren't going to make a deep playoff run, but the difference between a 6th pick and 12th is pretty meaningless too.  We are developing our bench, which means playing them a lot. Let them try and fail, let them try and succeed, but we can't be either hiding them behind our starters or sabotaging them with janky substitutions in tight games either.  Turning the draft pick we already have (i.e. Malachi Flynn) into a proper NBA tier point guard is worth more than getting another version of Flynn next year, and having them both be as raw and shaky as Flynn was earlier this year."
"Everyone might be surprised when the Hornets entire starting lineup isn't injured. Admittedly though, we don't have Malachi Flynn so it is a coin toss."
"Raptors, they have one of the best coaches in the NBA and have a really nice core. Dont sleep on Malachi Flynn and Chris Boucher. They have been really fun to watch this season."
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."
The real question is would you rather have Malachi Flynn or Lamelo Ball?

Malachi Flynn - he's the main guy that we're focusing our development on. He's getting a lot of touches too.
"Malachi Flynn. Go get him if he's available. Organization is making a concerted effort to get him as many touches as possible, and he's balled out in April.   If you need a big give Khem Birch a look. He's essentially on an extended tryout to be signed next season as a rotation big. Should be getting regular minutes."

"Malachi Flynn might be the greatest basketball player to ever grace the basketball court. Shame the tourney got cancelled last year, this man was going to ball the fuck out and probably get a higher draft position.  Wish the Raps would‚Äôve played him more at the start of the season, but with the logjam at point it would be tough to get him meaningful minutes, and the g-league stint definitely helped him acclimate more to the NBA. Now I‚Äôm not one to cheer for injuries, but with VanVleet &amp; Lowry being sidelined lately it really opened the door for him to make his case as a mf baller"
"But we can still do Lamelo Ball to Malachi Flynn comparisons, right?"
Malachi Flynn got robbed tbh
Wow. Can't believe Malachi Flynn outplayed the ROY
I was thinking the same. Although then Im guessing they will be compared more than Lamelo Ball and Malachi Flynn.

"It's questionable how much he was actually injured. TOR was sitting everyone to tank - FVV and Siakam had a lot of nights off too, and it was the Malachi Flynn show."
"No, but neither are posts about Malachi Flynn or tacko fall.  Most mediocre rookies get hyped to a certain degree. This is the sixers hyping theirs."
No. It‚Äôs been Malachi Flynn and it always will be.
Malachi Flynn vs LaMelo Ball
"He'll be an UFA so if they had no intention to re-sign him, might as well get something in return. Same thing for Matt Thomas.  They have FVV and Gary Trent Jr as their guards of the future and two promising rookies in Malachi Flynn and Jalen Harris, two players who will be cheaper. They also have Paul Watson.   Overall the Raptors made 3 good trades at the deadline. We'll see what the Kings do with Davis, but if they end up re-signing him without overpaying him it'll be a good trade for them too.   My nomination for the worst trade of recent years is the Lakers trading Zubac for Muscala. Just, why?"
Nelson Bobb to Malachi Flynn was 7 degrees

well... this proves it.  malachi flynn &gt; lamelo ball
"Just some incredible names on that list, but Stanley Johnson stands out. Paul Watson and Jalen Harris probably have outside fans confused too. Now we just need Malachi Flynn and Khem Birch to join the party."
Malachi Flynn with 0 turnovers as well. Has great handles and crisp passes.
We earned the playoff spot after facing Malachi Flynn.
Malachi Flynn is my new savior

You‚Äôre getting downvoted but let‚Äôs not forget malachi flynn
What is Malachi Flynn good at on offense
Malachi Flynn
Houston energy lately is  Harden for Olynyk  \#2 pick for Malachi Flynn &amp; the 4th pick
Malachi Flynn does need a backup if Lowry leaves.
"Might as well throw in Fred Vanvleet and Malachi Flynn as well, if you think so little of Steph."
"Depends on the direction they want to go. If they‚Äôre trying to contend now then probably not but if they want to rebuild then they should do it. Siakam is 27, he doesn‚Äôt really match up with a rebuilding team. I think a rebuilding team surrounded by Gary Trent jr, OG Anunoby, Jalen Suggs??(4th pick), Wiseman, Bouknight?? (7th pick), Giddey?? (14th pick), and Malachi Flynn is actually pretty formidable. Obviously I don‚Äôt know how the picks will turn out but that has potential to be a scary team in the future"
"Y‚Äôall sleeping on the Malachi Flynn + Kyle Lowry sign and trade. They get two guards, one for the present and one for the future"
Lucky for the league. This guy was ready to tear things up and break into stardom. Mark my words he was gonna be the next Malachi Flynn.
"Our core at the moment is split in two,   FVV &amp; Siakam: Older than the rest, entering their primes, and both under contract for another 2 - 3 seasons.     OG, GTJ, Malachi Flynn, plus whenever we draft this year: All under 23, with the exception of GTJ all of them are locked up long term.   With Siakam and FVV as our best players our ceiling is a second round exit, if we add a proper #1 option we can potentially compete with them in the next season or two. This is a long shot however. Most likely is that we hang around as a mid tier playoff team for the next two to three seasons, and use this as a transition period to develop the young core to take over as they begin entering their primes."
They‚Äôre rebuilding *because* Kawhi/Danny Green/Ibaka/Gasol left. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôd be playing with Malachi Flynn and Baynes if he stayed
LMAO nah man I'd definitely opt to build a team around Gary Trent Jr. and Malachi Flynn
"&gt; Snyder joined most of the Jazz‚Äôs front office in being frustrated by the selection of Udoka Azubuike with the team‚Äôs first-round pick in 2020.   Anyone know who the Jazz wanted instead? The players picked after him were Jaden McDaniels, Malachi Flynn, &amp; Desmond Bane. Xavier Tillman in the 2nd round would have been nice next to Gobert or as a small-ball center, as well."
Hey don‚Äôt forget that Malachi ‚ÄúBetter than Ball‚Äù Flynn is also on the team.
And Malachi Flynn if his development goes smoothly
"That would be a wild turn of events for Toronto and Siakam. Makes some sense though. They could go forward with a stellar young group including OG, Trent, Suggs/Green, Malachi Flynn, Wismen + #7. That‚Äôs a strong core of players 23 and under. They would still have FVV too to lead that group or trade off for more assets."
Fred Vanvleet. Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn. Not a star though but reminds me of CP3 a bit.
This is the second Mavs fan posting this kind of stuff. I hope Hornets fans dont get this upset when Malachi Flynn starts to outshine Lamelo again lol.
Maybe Jae'sean Tate? Also Malachi Flynn as the other person commented.
Typical homer answer but I thought Malachi Flynn showed a lot of potential in the 2nd half of the season after the Raptors fully committed to the tank.
is Malachi Flynn
"I‚Äôd offer 4th pick, FVV, Malachi Flynn, 3 FRP for Cade lol"
"Our core right now is made up of Siakam (27), FVV (27), OG (23), Lowry (35), Boucher (28) and Trent Jr (23). We then have whoever we pick at #4 this year, Red VanVleet Malachi Flynn (22) and Jalen Harris (22). Outside of OG and Trent, Siakam is line with our are current cores ages and talent so if you think we should trade him and not have him as part of the long term plans then that means we should also get rid of FVV and Boucher as well which then leaves us with what?"
Raptors should pick a player like Malachi Flynn.  Since they are such evaluators of top talents.
Hey detroit do u want malachi flynn and no.4 for no.1?
"2016: Siakam  2017: OG (not really any better picks after him)  2018: had no picks that year, so I'll use Spur's pick, which they got in the Kawhi trade. It would probably be Gary Trent Jr  2019: Dewan Hernandez??? (59th pick lol)  2020: Malachi Flynn or Desmond Bane, no player late in this draft showed that much promise as of yet."

I‚Äôm not saying Malachi Flynn should have made a team but [he didn‚Äôt get a single vote.](https://twitter.com/blakemurphyodc/status/1405678102567661579?s=21) He won a rookie of the month award and didn‚Äôt get a single vote?
Imo thats Malachi Flynn
"Before covid went through the team the raptors were fifth in the Eastern conference despite playing in Tampa Bay with home fans booing them. They went through a good chunk of the season with no playable center until khem birch came later on and gave some solid minutes.  Gary Trent, Malachi Flynn and birch all will have a full off season to settle in Flynn looks much improved.  Precious looks like a solid backup and we will see what Barnes can do as a rookie.  Meanwhile in the list above Toronto is not even mentioned. They are definitely being overlooked, not like we will we will be a top team in the east but to count raptors out of the playoffs is absurd. Huge improvements are coming compared to last year."
"You're missing Shai, he's got just under a million   Edit: also Gary Trent Jr   Edit: Malachi Flynn too"
"Norm Powell, FVV, Malachi Flynn. The man likes his small guards too"
"Toronto is easy.  Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch  Everyone else is expiring or a project."
"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
Malachi Flynn probably would have gone a bit further up too. Not lottery but probably closer to 20 than 30.
"&gt;Jrue clamped CP3 so hard that they had no option but to run the offense thru DBook. His ppg doesn't really matter in this context because if you watched the games with your eyes, Jrue clearly made CP3 far less impactful   Lmfao, no that makes no sense. You can't just throw away the stats to make a point.   &gt;And youre on crack if you think any GM in the league would take Precious over Maxey. Maxey is already better than Precious while also projecting to have a far higher ceiling.  We already have Malachi Flynn. We'd rather have Flynn + Precious than Flynn + Maxey when we need centers. Again, y'all are too high on Maxey doesn't mean everyone is."
"That VanVleet/Malachi Flynn backcourt is small and concerning defensively. I don't really trust Ben Simmons, but his size and guarding ability would at the very least make us elite defensively. I think the Raptors' fortunes next season depend on Gary Trent Jr turning into a consistent scorer and OG becoming an elite 2-way player. I don't think Siakam is a reliable 1st-option scoring threat, but if we do trade him I don't think it will be during the offseason. You have to at least see what this current roster does before making any firm decisions."
I really like Malachi Flynn. Dude is a walking bucket
"Malachi Flynn, stats say he averaged 7.5 ppg but that's because he got single digit numbers before all stat break, then he averaged like 17 points and 7 assists and 1 turnovers a game"
Malachi Flynn
Haliburton and Malachi Flynn
"ITT: every even middling young player in the league.  That said, I‚Äôm an avowed hypocrite and I will say Malachi Flynn"
Malachi flynn
"That‚Äôs awesome to hear, and honestly what I expected. His conditioning has needed to be better for a few years but he‚Äôs a monster in the paint. He helped hold Malachi Flynn and Matt Mitchell to 7-27 shooting in the MW Championship game a few years ago. I‚Äôm going to be keeping a close eye on Sacramento this year"
That Create-A-Player Defense is too strong.   Y'all can't handle this team of 14 forwards and Malachi Flynn.
Bruh they didn‚Äôt pass on Barnes because of Malachi Flynn lmfao
Malachi Flynn for the Raps. He's looking great in preseason.
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
"Malachi Flynn was a bad pick, right?"
"I'm sure he's gonna be great, but it's the summer league. Wasn't Malachi Flynn looking MVP caliber last summer league?"
"And?  We've got promising young prospects in OG, Gary Trent Jr., Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes. Aside from Wiseman, any prospects we got for Siakam would have to fight for minutes with them.  Also, for all of VanVleet's flaws, he's about as close to a cultural replacement as you can get for the juggernaut that was Lowry. Trading Siakam would compromise the franchise's relationship with FVV the same way trading DeMar compromised the relationship with Lowry, except there'd be no Kawhi to wash away the hurt feelings with on-court success."
Having him around for Malachi Flynn to learn from isn't a bad thing
We have Malachi Flynn who had a great game yesterday and is further along than Suggs right now.
FO is pretty high on Malachi Flynn. He may not have the ceiling of Suggs but he is solid and it provided the opportunity to draft Barnes who is a special kind of player‚Ä¶win-win.
See what happens when you don‚Äôt have Malachi Flynn?
"I can only think of D. Rose and Jordan Clarkson.. maybe TJ McConnell, Jalen Brunson,  and Patty Mills are arguable. Coincidentally I do like Malachi Flynn too."
"&gt;No idea why a team wouldn‚Äôt want him unless they‚Äôre tanking hard  Or they just want to give minutes to a PG that could actually be there long-term, like Malachi Flynn, rather than a 35 year old. Flynn probably gives them just as much a chance of winning as Dragic, he's good. Not strictly ""better"" as a player but he might be a better fit."
"I remember when Lamelo got outplayed by Malachi Flynn in a preseason game and didnt score in his first game. Stopped watching NBA, knew he wasn't gonna ever be good"
His higher ambition is to back up Luka instead of Malachi Flynn.
Malachi Flynn
Agreed but Malachi Flynn is ridiculous no matter what type of defense you play on him it doesn‚Äôt matter cause it‚Äôs going in   Does he have the luck of the gods
Remember when Malachi Flynn looked better than Lamelo?  You absolutely cannot use a one game sample size.
Shout out  Malachi Flynn 2020 Summer League hype.
Right. Malachi Flynn shouldn‚Äôt be what the fourth pick hinges on
Don‚Äôt let Scottie Barnes‚Äô performance distract you from Malachi lighting it up to. Raptors could have passed on Suggs due to the belief in Flynn taking that next step this year
"Malachi Flynn last year, though he improved a lot at the end of the year."
How about Malachi Flynn? Looked above everyone else's level
He's no Malachi Flynn
"Feel like Malachi Flynn will take a leap.  Hopefully see Fred get some more All-Defense nods if not votes, he really should‚Äôve been up there this last season. Just not enough games between covid/tanking/hip injury."
Malachi Flynn is known as a meme but he put up legit stats up last year. He‚Äôll be a big part of our future
"That‚Äôs what we have (we think) in Fred Van Vleet, and it seems like the coaches are hopeful in Malachi Flynn developing to that point to. We have an extremely solid young roster, with the oldest starter being Siakam, our bench is full of promising young players, and all our starters are below 28. Siakam is definitely someone we very well could trade if we get the right offer, such as one or two young prospects and 2ish draft picks. This season no reasonable fan expects us to contend, most of us think we‚Äôre going to play our young players more than the older starters to develop them, which means we should have semi-high lotto odds. This upcoming draft class is **stacked** with Paolo Banchero, Chet Holmgren, Jalen Duren, AJ Griffin, Jaden Hardy, etc. The top 8ish guys all look to have all-star potential. I‚Äôd be shocked if we don‚Äôt develop this year and get another lotto pick on this roster. With how we‚Äôve been able to develop players recently, this team has an extremely bright future which I‚Äôm excited for."
"If Dragic wants to go a contender then his agent needs to put in the work to entice teams to make an offer good enough for him to go. You're right Toronto is rebuilding (more accurately ""retooling) so yeah Dragic isn't gonna be a main character on this team. He is probably the 7th or 8th man depending on how Malachi Flynn plays."
Here's the thing. Toronto wasn't gonna do anything for cap space that Dragic not being there would free up. So they have no incentive to make that space appear. As a result they have no incentive to trade Dragic for nothing.   Toronto would rather let Dragic rot if he doesn't want to play in Toronto. It doesn't make Toronto any difference. That's more time for their young point guard Malachi Flynn.
Malachi Flynn plays both and has been developed to play both. Also Fred Van Vleet is a natural SG so he could play off ball again when Flynn is in.
"My flair will tell you I am biased towards the Raptors, but I think it is clear that the Raptors have the most leverage here, with Miami having the least leverage.   Miami needs the Lowry deal to go through and the Raptors want to help, but only if Miami compensates them enough. Achiuwa is clearly not enough to justify taking Dragic's contract. For the deal to go through, Toronto needs to be compensated. This can either come from Miami or Dallas. Dallas doesn't want to give anything of value for Dragic, so they would need compensation as well. Raptors are not going to give anything to Dallas to take on Dragic (obviously), so everything will have to come from Miami. People have floated around 2nd round picks/KZ Okpala, but I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about how Herro will become a sticking point. Miami has been adamant about not trading him, but what would happen if keeping Herro is what makes the deal fall apart? This is just speculation, though. Most likely scenario is KZ Okpala, a lightly protected FRP, and a SRP will be given to the Raptors to absorb Dragic's contract.   I personally think that a Malachi Flynn and Herro swap would be interesting, but Miami would apparently let the entire deal fall apart before they trade Herro."
This years Malachi Flynn with all these summer league posts lol.
Yeah and I would also love for Malachi Flynn to become a poor man's Steph Curry but some things aren't possible lol.
Malachi Flynn is Red VanVleet
"Its actually quite the opposite for them Scottie Barnes IG BIO says ""6'9 PG"" and they have Vanvleet,Gary Trent and Malachi Flynn, their forwards outside of OG and Siakam are pretty weak and Boucher is actually 28 so not young at all"
Malachi Flynn
"So since the 2016 draft there are a few candidates  * Raptors got: Siakam,Vanvleet,OG,Terence Davis,Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes * Heat got: Bam,Herro,Robinson,Precious and Nunn * Sixers: Simmons,Fultz,Thybulle and Maxey  But I think its the celtics: Brown,Tatum,Williams,Grant,Langford and Pritchard"
"Ok bud. Y‚Äôall Lakers fans are deluded. I‚Äôd rather play Malachi Flynn, and lose Lowry for nothing then take on Schroder."
"bruh, we drafted Malachi Flynn and then a buncha Raptor fans thought that meant the Raptors FO wasn't offering FVV a contract.  It's wild how much investment some fans put into the draft, right away lol"
"&gt;but it‚Äôs also possible that they get another PG in free agency to replace Lowry.  &gt;  probably bring someone in, but for sure more minutes for Malachi Flynn"
"I think if we stay over the cap we get the non-taxpayer exception, so 9.2M to start in the first year. Won't get Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen, but Olynyk or Theis maybe, and we will need the shooting for damn sure.  Also, it's possible we could do something like Jarrett Allen sign and trade for Hood, Boucher and Malachi Flynn, that would get us up to being able to offer low 20s a year with max increases."
"What is Raptors-Fans opinion on Malachi Flynn? Is he a real NBA Point Guard? Because I think they need some more depth there, even if Lowry is staying"
This could be just a small part of their off season plans .. maybe Siakim goes .. maybe they really believe in FVV and Malachi Flynn and don't believe that's a need .. or maybe Lowry ends his career in Toronto . Who knows
"I don‚Äôt think the Raptors would make that move.   They have FVV, Malachi Flynn, and are most likely drafting Suggs"
If you dont think Malachi Flynn is better than MJ thats a YOU problem. /s
"You forgot Masai, the Raptors janitorial staff, and Malachi Flynn"
Malachi Flynn
"I mean, it is the one thing that really changed roster-wise between the 2019-20 Toronto Raptors who went 53-19 and the 2020-21 Toronto Raptors who went 27-45. The two biggest pieces we lost in between those two seasons was, coincidently, our two centres in Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol. We also lost Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, O'Shae Brissett, Dewan Hernandez and Malcolm Miller but they were marginal bench pieces who we replaced with DeAndre Bembre, Malachi Flynn &amp; Yuta Watanbe as well as increased role for Northman Powell + Gary Trent Junya. Roster-wise, the only difference of consequence is going from two centres who were both able to start for us and going to two unplayable centres in Aron Baynes who is just washed af and Alex Len. So yeah, if we had playable centres, I think that would be the solution to what is the only roster we have.  Obligatory Fuck Tampa Bay as well."
"Lol they were hyping up Davis, Malachi Flynn and Chris Boucher as future prospects but he wants to talk about us üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don‚Äôt really count it."
"Knicks, Hawks, Wizards, Hornets, Heat and Cavs  Malachi Flynn, Barnes and Achiuwa are pretty much unproven. Dragic would be the best player on the bench and he‚Äôs on the decline + doesn‚Äôt wanna be in Toronto. Boucher is solid  The bench does not deserve to be number one at all"
"Payton was more consistent from start to finish, but once Toronto started tanking it out and Flynn received starter minutes he showed me play that was better than anything I‚Äôd seen from Pritchard, especially defensively. I expect Malachi to be the better player this season."
"Malachi Flynn.   He had a rough start to his rookie year but once he began receiving starter minutes consistently, he looked amazing. He‚Äôs a great combo guard, superb handle and shiftiness. Stout defender for his position. If his 3-pointer is falling consistently he‚Äôll be a terrific bench player."
Malachi Flynn
"I dont think they are in purgatory but their timeline is kind of weird. The young players they have that are 24 years old or younger are OG Anunoby,Gary Trent Jr,Scottie Barnes,Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn, OG and Gary are already starting level players,Scottie is a project who has star potential and both Flynn and Precious looked good in summer league and could develop well. Imo thats a fringe top 10 young core  Its just that on top of those guys they also have a bunch of win now players who dont really have time to develop like Siakam,Fred,Boucher,Dragic and Birch who would rather win now"
&gt; Malachi Flynn efficiency will have to improve but his playmaking and defense is solid for a rookie guard and he‚Äôll get consistent minutes next year to continue to develop  I've watched like all of Flynn's NBA career and his Summer League this year and I think his passing is absolutely not good
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
Malachi Flynn?
I wouldnt do that as the raptors lol take out FVV and replace him with Malachi Flynn
They can. See Malachi Flynn
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"Raptors - Siakam, OG, FVV, Barnes, Trent  Leaves Malachi Flynn up for grabs, not bad."
Is it ~really~ a log jam?  PG: FVV / Malachi Flynn  SG: GTJ / ???  SF: OG / Yuta Watanbe  PF: Siakam / Scottie Barnes  C: Khem Birch / Chris Boucher  Also with Scottie Barnes and OG those are basically positionless players
Don‚Äôt forget Malachi Flynn
"OG Anonoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Fred VanVleet, etc‚Ä¶  Wouldn‚Äôt say ruined cause i like watching good hoopers, moreso ruined in NBA discussions"
"On the other side, the trade would've looked a lot better if the picks turned out to be Bruno or Malachi Flynn"
"Pft, just wait till there's a hot mic on Malachi Flynn on the bench!!!"
Malachi flynn zero minutes past 2 games :(
"If by beat y'all over the head you mean one post comparing Flynn and Ball in a head to head preseason game which then became a meme for the season, then sure we beat y'all over the head with Malachi Flynn."
Last year raps fans really tried to beat us over the head with Malachi Flynn.
Raptors fans legitimately saying Malachi Flynn &gt; Lamelo
Malachi Flynn needs to play an evil sorcerer in something lol
"Malachi Flynn and Jalen Green.   Easy, next question."
I‚Äôm convinced Malachi Flynn is better than wb
"This is Masai Ujiru's music. The 76ers have quickly reached Demar Derozan level prices from their outrageous demands. Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn and a 1st incoming."
their roster is kinda strange but i‚Äôm not sleeping on malachi flynn
"Dragic isn't under contract for next season, so he's already not being included in that group. Same for Boucher. You need to look at the salaries for 2022-23, that's what would count for trying to open up a max slot for Ayton.   Siakam, FVV, OG, Barnes and Precious is $84 million if the Raptors get rid of literally everyone else in salary dumps or just waiving them (which would include Gary Trent Jr., Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, etc). That $84 million leaves $35 million under a $119 million cap, but then you have to include about $7 million for cap holds for empty roster spots, which brings that down to $28 million. Ayton's max would start at $30 million, as it would be 25% of the $119 million cap."
"Outside of Bruno Caboclo, we hit on all of our picks even if they were late:  2015: Delon Wright- 20th   2016: Jakob Poetl- 9th              Pascal Siakam- 27th  2017- OG Anunoby- 23rd  2020- Malachi Flynn- 29th   They were good role players at worst"
"And yet in the playoffs Milwaukee was the number one defensive team with a DRTG of 107.6 and the 11th best offensive team with an ORTG of 112.9. So yes, that's the biggest driving force for why the Bucks won, the Giannis being one of if not the best help defender which they crafted their entire defensive scheme around and supplemented with players to minimize Giannis' weaknesses namely guarding guards and smaller wings on the perimeter. Wow, it's almost like teams turn up on defense when they are in a seven-game series cause they can gameplan more, especially ones with transcendent defensive players like Giannis.  The Jazz fell off defensively, but like I pointed out before not because Gobert is a bad defender or not all he is cracked up to be but because the Jazz built their team on just funnelling drives to the middle into Gobert cause he is the best defensive big in the game right now and have a ton of guards and wings who are just bad at preventing straight-line drives or at bare minimum being enough of a deterrent so that Gobert can more easily come in to help on top of having the ballhandlers man coming up on their hip. But, as people who have some actual understanding of NBA defense especially in the playoffs have been saying for seasons now, the Jazz have overly relied on Gobert to be the end all be all of their defensive system which makes it easy to gameplan against as shown year in year out in the playoffs. Is this because of Gobert? No, because Nick Nurse and the Raptors coaching staff crafted a defensive system to hide the weakness and bouy the strengths of an even slower footed defensive-minded centre in Marc Gasol by having our guards being aggressive on screens so as to stay on the ballhandlers which allows Gasol to help and then recover, on top of drilling rotating to the open man for all our guards and wings, on top of the coaching staff minimizing minutes for players who are weaknesses on defense whether it be due to physically not being able to (Matt Thomas for example) or not being able to keep up mentally with the scheme (Terence Davis in his second season and Malachi Flynn for example), on top of the front office looking to bring in players who can actually play defense as well. If the Jazz were to not have a roster of wings and guards who are just not good defensively and just hope &amp; pray that Gobert goes Super Saiyan-jin, the Jazz's failings are on the coaching staff and front office. Cause in the regular season where their scheme works cause teams are not gameplanning every single night but rather have generalized schemes on both ends, their ""Gobert, Sink Or Swim"" defense works and has year in year out."
Malachi flynn and svi idk how to spell or pronounce his name.  Big pieces off the bench imo.
this season's malachi flynn but worse
TBD on malachi flynn but scottie looks very promising.
Aren‚Äôt Raptors fan known to seek attention like that tho? There are people that were complaining about the heavy focus on Lamelo and the lack of attention on Malachi Flynn last year for example
"Whatever happened to ""iM dOne WiTh ThiS"" like 8 comments ago? üòÇ  You're so pressed that you feel the need to vindicate yourself because people on Reddit figured out that you're a loser.  This guy also spews trash unironically saying Malachi Flynn is better than Suggs too lmao."
Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn vs. Lamelo Ball
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."

What? Ratio of what? Who is Malachi Flynn?  Edit: wait that guy plays for the raptors. Wrong thread?
raps fans were saying malachi flynn was better than lamelo after preseason
Yes. I‚Äôm referencing the fact that Malachi Flynn is better than Lame-Lo ‚ÄúSucks‚Äù Balls
Malachi Flynn better + ratio
Raptors fans are gonna be so unbearable this season. it was hell listening to them talk about Malachi Flynn and now they are gonna try and convince everyone that passing on Suggs was the right call.
Arguing with raptors fan on r/nba is useless coz it seems like they all come together and downvote everyone.   Remember last year Malachi Flynn vs lamelo pre season posts
LaMelo is so fucking nice with it.  Actually so happy for the Hornets man they deserve it  Malachi Flynn better tho ^^^/s
Malachi Flynn? Not even better than Malachi Richardson
&gt; Better than Malachi Flynn???????  Yes. He's still better than evil Seth Curry
"Oof, I hope Barnes isn't just the new Malachi Flynn.   I really did like him coming into the draft."
"I'm just saying people gotta wait more than one preseason game to make any kinda remotely accurate predictions. Some takes are gonna age like Malachi Flynn ROY from last season. I'm sure he'll be good, but preseason isn't the way to gauge that."
Jeez idk how I misread multiple of these. Fixed. Still early in the morning for me. I know there is a sector of raptors fans that *looove* Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn was the 29th pick though
2016 - Ingram becomes Jaylen Brown  2017 - Ball becomes Tatum  2018- Wagner becomes Chamet   2019 - Hunter becomes Garland but we traded him for AD  2020 - Jaden McDaniels becomes Malachi Flynn
Holy shit we‚Äôd be terrible   Siakam ‚Äî&gt; Skal Labissi√®re  OG ‚Äî&gt; Tyler Lydon (who tf is this??)  2018 N/A  2019 N/A  2020 Malachi Flynn ‚Äî&gt; Desmond Bane   Pascal and OG are our core now. Both guys picked after them were scrubs who aren‚Äôt even in the league now. What a difference good drafting does.
Trade Kyrie for Malachi Flynn
Precious Achiuwa-&gt;Gerald Wallace/Mo Harkless  Malachi Flynn-&gt;Patty Mills  Our bench is better than our starting lineup!
steph curry and malachi flynn (sith curry)
Malachi Flynn was labeled as better than LaMelo Ball
Malachi ‚Äú1/7 FG and 0/6 3PT‚Äù Flynn
"Raptors lose Kawhi Leonard, get Malachi Flynn... wait what?"
maxey and quickley are both late first round 2020 draft pick guards taking on big roles for their team this year  RIP malachi flynn
"Locked up by Malachi Flynn, you hate to see it."
I saw on the Raptors sub today hes younger than Malachi Flynn.
"By people outside of our fan base? Boucher  Within the fan base? Probably Malachi Flynn. He's not terrible, but it's certainly not some crime against humanity that he only plays a couple of minutes like some people in our subreddit believe."
"Malachi Flynn also won ROTM and has sucked since, lol."
He'll be with Malachi Flynn and Kevin Knox in the pre-season hall of fame.
Steph looks like Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn is one of the most Amish sounding names in the NBA.
Malachi Flynn gonna explode for 40 in the 2nd half.
From a neutral perspective:  &amp;#x200B;  SUPER SURPRISE:  Kelan Martin  - SF on the Pacers  Omer Yutseven - PF on Heat  Jalen McDaniels -PF on Hornets  Franz Wagner - SF on Magic  Malachi Flynn - PG on Raptors  Isiah Jackson - C on Pacers  &amp;#x200B;  NOT SURPRISING:  Scottie Barnes:  Patrick Williams  Mobley  Lu Dort  Tyrese Haliburton  Immanuel Quickley:  Tyrese Maxey
You may have Goran Dragic and Malachi Flynn
i really thought malachi flynn was gonna be amazing.
"It makes sense to me that he's playing them heavy minutes since our likely best players are also our youngest players. GTJ, Scottie, OG, Precious are all in the top 5 most played minutes (FVV is 1st) and they all are 24 or younger. Getting them the most development time as possible seems like killing 2 birds with one stone. The only one odd one out is Malachi Flynn who's being supplanted by another young player, Banton."
And nobody relentlessly pushes their prospects like Raptors fans. You‚Äôd have thought Malachi Flynn was a lock for All-NBA if you‚Äôd only looked at Raptors social media last year.
"idk why y‚Äôall are booing me this trade would make both teams better, maybe throw in Boucher or Malachi Flynn and Bembry for the homecoming"
"[Woj] Lebron James has been traded to the Raptors for Goran Dragic, Chris Boucher and Malachi Flynn"
"&gt;Only in FVV, Malachi Flynn &amp; Bird have I seen this specific quality.  You put Flynn in the same sentence as Larry Bird? Lol"
RIP Malachi Flynn  May he rise again next year
"Scottie Barnes has more potential than Giannis imo. The one thing about this guy, so far. Almost every basketball decision he makes on the court(not just passes), I tend to agree with. It's 70/30 at most even with elite players like Bron.. With him it's nearing 90/10. Crazy You know how you're watching a play develop and you say something under your breath on what's about to happen... he does it and you're there thinking maybe you &amp; Scottie have a special connection. Idk what to call that. Only in FVV, Malachi Flynn &amp; Bird have I seen this specific quality."
"We were starting Malachi Flynn, Jalen Harris, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson Jr  didn‚Äôt really miss them if we weren‚Äôt trying to make them"
The new Malachi Flynn
[Dalano Banton introduces himself to Bradley Beal | A Moment In Raptors History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cuj3VT64bmw&amp;ab_channel=RaptorMoments)  [Nick Nurse's mysterious Fisherman's Friend scene | A Moment In Raptors History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pnue7OI00o&amp;ab_channel=RaptorMoments)  [Nick Nurse hypes up Malachi Flynn before draining a 3 | A Moment In Raptors History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awBBs3X4V28&amp;ab_channel=RaptorMoments)
Malachi Flynn?
You can have Malachi Flynn
"The one thing about this guy, so far. Almost every basketball decision he makes on the court(not just passes), I tend to agree with. It's 70/30 at most even with elite players like Bron.. With him it's nearing 90/10.

Idk what to call that. Only in FVV, Malachi Flynn &amp; Bird have I seen this specific quality."
I can't wait for all these Pascal takes to go completely rancid less than a month from now the way Raptors fans defending Precious and Malachi Flynn did
Sam Hauser  Bol Bol  Saben Lee  Usman Garuba  Yves Pons  Paul Reed  Jalen Smith  Joe Wieskamp (should not be on a two-way)  Malachi Flynn
Lowkey Malachi Flynn
"Malachi Flynn rn. It makes no sense that he isn‚Äôt getting minutes, every time he‚Äôs played he‚Äôs been good. Plus Fred needs to seriously rest, that man is gonna get gassed at this rate, or worse, injured."
Speaking of Cole Anthony comparisons how‚Äôs summer league legen Malachi Flynn doing?
"If it makes it any better, a lot of us raptors fans don't like when its super excessive either. Or the excess victim mentality. Hell there was a clown earlier during the game that made a thread asking if malachi flynn will be an all star."
Malachi Flynn MVP
"Yeah Nick Nurse and the Raptors put a lot of emphasis on defense, and our new guys learning the defensive schemes was a big reason we had such a slow start last year. I love that GTJ is being more aggressive on ball, and despite Malachi Flynn being a great prospect, he‚Äôs continued to be benched because his defense isn‚Äôt up to par. Same with Dragic."
so Malachi Flynn could be the next larry bird? I knew it!
#MALACHI FLYNN SIGHTING!
**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
Malachi Flynn is Lamelo but actually good. Raptors are getting robbed ^^^/s
Ya he's a bust.   I'll give you Malachi Flynn for Cade.  Take it or leave it.
Lets not have the malachi flynn saga 2.0 on our hands
Eh it's not so much we prefer younger guys. Nurse goes with what works. Malachi Flynn doesn't get much burn either.
Whose Malachi Flynn? All I know is a Red VanVleet. Which you can have for one Steph Curry. He's basically like Steph but younger and with a lot more potential. Don't google that and just take my word for it.
But you already have Steph Curry named Malachi Flynn
Malachi Flynn would never have taken those dumb fouls
"You got Boucher, Precious and Malachi Flynn all on the court together"
bruh why tf does Malachi Flynn keep going off against us every game; even if he doesn't score the Raptors go on a run as soon he enters the floor -_-
Malachi Flynn has been freed!
Yeah but Malachi Flynn is better than LaMelo
malachi flynn disagrees
Even Masai fucked that one up. He picked Malachi Flynn one pick earlier. Flynn's not even in the Raptors rotation this season lol
Malachi Flynn remembers
Malachi Flynn. This is coming from a lifelong fan btw
"Goran dragic is a savvy vet u can actually use, maybe malachi flynn as well just because we‚Äôre nice."
Took top spot from Malachi Flynn probably.
Malachi may well be Flynn-ished in Toronto. The kid from Rexdale has already displaced him
Malachi Flynn though
"Well it's official, after tonight's game we can stop the debates and declare a winner... Cole Anthony is better than Malachi Flynn"
Remember Malachi Flynn last season ?
"Who says no: Turner for Dragic, Malachi Flynn plus a 2023 lottery protected first round pick.   Pacers get an expiring contract (vs. 2 remaining years for Turner) and a marginal guard prospect with 3 years of control left. and a pick in 2023/ 2024.  Raptors' pick may materialize in 2024 if they don't make the playoffs in 2023 and it would net them another prospect to fit in with the Barnes timeline."
We drafted Malachi Flynn over Bane and Tillman and I don't even think Flynn is an NBA player
2015: Delon Wright with pick 20  2015: Norm Powell with pick 46  2016: Jakob Poetl with pick 9  2016: Siakam with pick 27  2016: FVV undrafted  2017: OG Anunoby with pick 23  2019: Terence Davis undrafted  2020: Malachi Flynn with pick 29  2021: Scottie Barnes with pick 4  2021: Dalano Banton with pick 46
Who's the best rookie on the Raps? Is it Malachi Flynn or Norman Powell?
Malachi Flynn lookin like albino Tyler herro
"This isn't a ""report."" Windhorst literally said that he's ""guessing.""  &gt; ""I'm sure it would have to be Siakam. I'm not sure, let me step back, but I would guess that the Rockets would want Malachi Flynn and then you're looking at multiple first-round draft picks into the future. Probably lightly protected or unprotected."" ESPN's Brian Windhorst told Sportsnet's Good Show on Monday."
pre-szn legend malachi flynn
"I‚Äôve been whining for Nurse to play Flynn, don‚Äôt let me down Malachi"
"Malachi ‚Äúliterally the best draft pick since Michael Jordan‚Äù Flynn in the game, oh shit"
Malachi Flynn over Jake Layman at 274 is a **travesty** and I simply cannot read any further
Malachi Flynn
But what about Malachi Flynn??
"They need to blow it up, have you heard of Malachi Flynn, they should trade KD or Kyrie for him. /s"
The Raptors should give Malachi Flynn his minutes.
Weird Malachi Flynn isn't on this list?
"I agree.   Him and a Malachi Flynn is probably a guaranteed championship, nor sure why the Suns aren't doing whatever they can to pair the two? Booker is redundant at this point, practically useless compared to CP3."
I mean I've heard Malachi Flynn is the best player in the draft class.
"Raptors pick Malachi Flynn, obviously"
Ya‚Äôll dont want to play Malachi Flynn feel free to trade him to LA.
we‚Äôd be happy to trade malachi flynn for him!!
Can we trade Siakam for Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas?
"One thing I just kept noticing is that if the Hornets had just drafted Malachi Flynn, would we not be the favorite in the East?  How could we be so blind to such generational talent? Like he would've made the obvious difference this game."
But have you considered Malachi Flynn
If only the Hornets had Malachi Flynn
Seriously still so pissed we didn‚Äôt take Malachi Flynn over this guy? Like what the fuck was Kupchak thinking?
Fuck can‚Äôt believe we took this guy over Malachi Flynn
But is he better then Malachi Flynn?
Malachi Flynn tho
one day he might be as good as Malachi Flynn tho    ^^^/s
"For me it depends on the cost. If we have to give up both Siakam and OG that‚Äôs a no from me. If it‚Äôs something like Pascal, Malachi Flynn, Terrence Davis and 2-3 first round picks I agree. But I think they‚Äôd want a package like the Pelicans got for AD, the Thunder got for PG. from everything that‚Äôs been reported it feels like Houston wants someone to break the bank for Harden. I just don‚Äôt see other teams doing it, the Raptors included.   If it were me, I‚Äôd let the Rockets wait it out, let Harden continue to ball out for them and run down the time on his contract then try and get Harden for a more equally beneficial deal"
"This is why it's a 3+ team trade.     You guys don't want to build around Siakam but Denver would LOVE having a core locked in for 3 years to try and win a chip. Siakam was a #2 option with Kawhi, Murray and Jokic would be a great fit for him as a #3.     Basically we're using Siakam to send out salary/acquire picks to give to you guys so you have a lil variety to the 3+3 unprotected's we're giving you plus young guys like Terence Davis/Malachi Flynn/Norm Powell and a whole lot of sweet salary filler with names such as McCaw and Stanimal"
Malachi Flynn was truly the difference maker. Steal of the draft.
Why are you thinking about Malachi Flynn at all OP
nah there are a ton of lamelo haters on this sub (that arent raptors fans) that said that malachi flynn was better than lamelo (because of one preseason game)
who is malachi flynn   is he like Raptors version of talen horton tucker?
