Kyle Lowry and FVV
lol there are very few teams where kyle lowry wouldn't be a good fit.  he can play on or off ball and is responsible on both ends.    the problem is the clips have literally nothing we want except zubac.
"Damn, Toronto‚Äôs reign on top was short like leprechauns &amp; Kyle Lowry  U rlly do h8 2 AOC it"
"Sixers lead series 3-1.  Game 5 Sixers won series 4-1.   Final score: Sixers 138- 110 Nets  Joel Embiid: 40pts, 15 reb, 3 ast, 4 blk Ben Simmons: 21pts, 14reb, 12ast, 5 stl Tobias Harris: 27pts, 12 reb, 3 ast Kyle Lowry: 21pts, 4reb, 14ast"
"It doesn't have to be that much in assets. You can also have junk salary filler. Would it be a bit tricky? Yes. But when you are getting Kyle freaking Lowry, you do it if you can."
Because you absolutely can get something of value for him. It's Kyle freaking Lowry
Kyle Lowry is like a fine wine. I can legitimately see him being an impactful player until he's 40 just like CP3. Ppl shouldn't get too hung up on his age IMO.
"I think we'll at least try to bring him back, and I don't know what he wants really but we can pay him, compete and let him handle the ball as well, so on paper we have almost everything he can ask for (except Kyle Lowry)"
&gt; Kyle Lowry won‚Äôt be helping when it comes to playoff defense.   Just say you don't actually watch basketball and move on
Kyle Lowry üçë
"Big list, but...  &amp;#x200B;  **Victor Oladipo**  HOU  **PJ Tucker**  HOU  **Eric Gordon**  CHA  **Richaun Holmes**  SAS  **Nemanja Bjelica**  SAC  **George Hill**  LAC, if they have enough cap space  **Al Horford**  Stays or is released.  Bad contract  **JJ Redick**  Whoever needs shooting.  MKE or LAL probibly, maybe back to Philly  **Nikola Vucevic**  Hornets?  Maybe Celtics  **Evan Fournier**  Stays in ORL  **Terrence Ross**  Warriors or Hornets  **John Collins**  Depends.  Likely ether traded to WSH for Beal or SAS for DeRozan, maybe HOU for Olidipo  **Larry Nance**  CLE  **Kyle Lowry**  Clippers is a nice fit, but no cap space.  If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
Whatever player is being backed down by Kyle Lowry.
"&gt; Why would I assume Lowry would re-sign?   He‚Äôs from Philly, has property in Philly, family in Philly.. really shouldn‚Äôt need to be explained. If Kyle goes to Philly it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion he re-signs."
"Kenny was playing with hakeem and two other guys on the team scoring about the same, tough case to make a middling playoff team having multiple allstars, and even then he'd be 1 of 3 guys outside hakeem averaging around 17ppg so there's far from a guarantee he'd win.   Kenny's fun but he's not an allstar. In todays game he might be an allstar tbh. The talent is nuts but it's also diluted in a way where it's more about the character of the guy that determines his career than his college/hs talent. In todays NBA Kenny coulda been a Kyle Lowry type player but back then those players were probably more common. No disrespect to Lowry, it's not easy being an OG in todays world lol"
This is a bad paraphrasing of [an article from two weeks ago](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/philadelphia-sixers-trade-rumors-kyle-lowry-toronto-raptors-20210225.html) that said the Clippers could be a potential trade destination for Lowry because they'd be a good fit.  The article didn't say the Clippers were interested or that they had reached out or that there had been any discussions. It just said a source said he'd be a good fit.
Clippers: Here's 2 nickels and some taco bell coupons give us Kyle Lowry
&gt; Kyle Lowry won‚Äôt be helping when it comes to playoff defense  Not sure I know what you mean.
"The Clippers are making moves to try to get someone who can stop Mike Conley. Dude is an absolute animal, and Kyle Lowry won‚Äôt be helping when it comes to playoff defense. Say your prayers LA because the True Kings of the North are coming üòà"
"Jarrett Culver and Josh Okogie for Kyle Lowry, who says hell  no??"
Kyle Lowry ends up on the Toronto Raptors. He deserves a winning organization
During the 2016 and 2017 seasons shooting wasn‚Äôt as essential as it is today; weird for only 4-5 years ago but the league has adapted in that time. Plus in the 2017 season Westbrook could shoot and was the most clutch player in the league. After 2017 I don‚Äôt think he could but in 2016 he played better than KD against the warriors and they nearly won and was statistically slightly more efficient than league average; in 2017 he was league average in efficiency so like non of your criticism apply. Don‚Äôt let Westbrook‚Äôs decline or the hate he gets skew how good he was at his peak.   For AD he‚Äôs obviously not as good as Steph and he‚Äôs not going to achieve the same amount of success as Steph did. I think a play maker of the quality of Kyle Lowry would push AD to the point where he reasonably could be the number 1 option on a real contender but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they for sure win and maybe if he needs that he isn‚Äôt at that level offensively.
Can thank Nick Nurse and especially Kyle Lowry for trying to draw charges right to the very end lol
All that showed me is that the All Star game needs Kyle Lowry
Coach Nick Nurse actually drawing up defensive plays and Kyle Lowry taking charges during last year's all star game definitely set a high standard. At least the players have been having fun this year.
You know what this all star game needs? A couple Kyle Lowry charges
When the 4th quarter sucks cause it‚Äôs gonna be quick I‚Äôm gonna blame the lack of Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry wouldve taken that charge.
Kinda boring so far. Liked it when they actually tried to win last year. Need that Kyle Lowry energy back
The all star game isn't the same without Kyle Lowry
Finals would be Marcus Smart vs Kyle Lowry every year
So we are just going to ignore this year and 2018 where Lowry won? For this trash stat. Jesus imagine bringing up a stat that says Kyle Lowry is the best player in the NBA and use that as an argument for anything
"Yeah, I would say so, or maybe not stunted his potential but he definitely underutilized him. Casey‚Äôs time in Toronto he was famous for expecting Lowry/DeRozan to ride him off to the promised land without much of a backup plan that it seemed like he completely forgot the beast that he had down low.   You could really see JV come into his own in his final years as a Raptor when we would get to the playoffs and DeMar/Kyle had their fair share of struggles, but JV was basically an automatic bucket whenever you threw the ball down to him."
Kyle Lowry bitches quite a bit.. love him though
"CP3 never did any ‚Äúcarrying‚Äù from 2014-19. He literally always had another all star on his team for all of those years, he wasn‚Äôt even the best player on his team in 2018 or 2019. I don‚Äôt get why people like you pretend that CP3 is some playoff wizard when he‚Äôs got less success than guys like Harden, Westbrook, and even Kyle Lowry.   He‚Äôs a great player that almost always disappoints in the playoffs. It‚Äôs not always his fault, but it‚Äôs the truth. He‚Äôs basically the Tracy McGrady of the 2010s."
Subscribe. All my homies hate Kyle Lowry.
I want Timelord to dunk on Kyle Lowry in the same manner that Lebron dunked on the jet

"Screw it. You might be a kid still so let me break it down for you as simple as I can.   -I don‚Äôt think Kyle Lowry did a dirty play. He was just freeing his foot   -‚Äúhe did it first‚Äù is a lame attempt to defend a dirty play  -now use your brain and put the two together. HAD that play been dirty, the reasoning used to defend Kyle Lowry WOULD HAVE been a stupid one to use.    Read what you wrote. ‚ÄúYou say it‚Äôs not dirty. But then I defend it because it‚Äôs not a dirty play‚Äù  Like does that even make sense to you? What are you defending if I already called it not dirty? Lmfao"
All my homies hate kyle lowry
"i mean that‚Äôs what taking a charge is? and they‚Äôre not gonna give it to you unless you fall down. not everyone is an athletic freak that can meet people at the summit. the charge is a tool that makes smaller guys like kyle lowry and chris paul able to be savvy, full court defenders.   you can argue whether dame was sliding but writing off the whole concept of a charge is wild."
"Joel ""Patrick 'Rasheed Wallace' 'Kyle Lowry' 'Marcus Smart' Beverly"" Hans Embiid"
I've played rugby for many years and you don't have to kick people in the face to free your foot from their grasp. Kyle Lowry is a dirty player for this play. Blatant intent and a weak 'he had my foot' excuse. Should get fined by the league.
Kyle Lowry low key a dirty ass player
Gobert is not physically built for post defense. Kyle Lowry probably weighs more than him
I just wanna say fuck Kyle Lowry. Dude punted a guy that just came back from having a concussion
Kyle Lowry prime example
Philly- Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like he's some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time he's not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..

Because he was nowhere near his prime and was a shell of his former self. Kyle Lowry after his first Raptor year is the same as he is even pretty much to this day.
"The answers the 2011 Mavs, but I do have a weird soft spot for the random mashup that was the 2019 Raptors. Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry, Jeremy Lin, Serge."
You are Thicker than Kyle Lowry booty.
Nba refs are effecting the games way too much. Teams lose challenges because of blatant missed calls by officials in crunch time. You can swat at a fly and get called for a tech. In the bubble Kyle Lowry received a technical foul for shouting 'and 1'. I mean the jj Reddick ejection a week ago? Give me a break. These refs walk onto the floor and they *know* they're going to fuck with certain players and that unfortunately is a major factor in the result of these games.
"Cute, but nothing will ever surpass the cuteness of KYLE LA LA LOWRY  [Raptors intro bubble 2020](https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1295585250266021893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295585250266021893%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-36149644553353336930.ampproject.net%2F2102130314004%2Fframe.html)"
"Hard disagree on the first part. Absolutely can get annoying watching players mouthing off after every play, especially when they're choosing to do so over getting back on the other end of the floor.   Not only does it get annoying to watch, but it's ridiculous to say that shit has no direct effect on a game. Veterans like Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, etc don't do it every single game for fun. They do it because they know the more they do the more they can influence the whistle to go their way."
"Of course, Kenny ""Kyle Lowry"" Smith."
You mean kyle lowry
"For the knicks we should look at Lonzo and Gary Trent even though there are RFA  For UFA, Evan Fournier, Norman Powell or Kyle Lowry would be nice"
Tomorrow will be immortalized as the day Kyle Lowry took 100 charges
Behind Kyle Lowry who is the goat of two franchises isnt that amazing
i think it‚Äôs spelled Kyle Lowry.....
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Worst fan take:  *After 1-3 bad games that an all star/MVP level player is trash/overhated/washed/exposed (aka those weird Facebook people that create accounts just to hate on like one player)  Worst YouTube Take: Lonzo Ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical  Worst Media/NBA Award: 2016 All NBA  Deandre Jordan being voted 1st team All NBA tied with James Harden not making any All NBA team (Kyle Lowry, CP3, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook and Damien Lillard) being guards who made it over him"
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human... oh fuck did I say fuck?

"Raptors: [have no real rebounding]  Kyle Lowry: Fine, I'll do it myself."
Coach Kyle Lowry
" Kyle wants to contend and be paid. We are not contenders and our owners don‚Äôt pay tax for a middling team.              &gt;	What else is out there for him? Getting blamed in Philly when Embiid and Simmons underperform again?    More money, and Philly with Lowry is a championship team."
How dare you disrespect Kyle Lowry like that
Kyle Lowry is aging like fine wine
"I don‚Äôt think any serious raps fans want Lowry gone, but we‚Äôd be fine with him leaving since he‚Äôs done so much for us. But ofc Kyle stay plz"

Kyle Lowry vs Nwaba is about the most interesting part of this so far.

Kyle Lowry is expected to replace him tonight
My inner Raptor fan defending Lowry response has come out LOL  How did Kyle lose them the game? By fouling AD when he was on an island in the post?
"We were robbed of player-coach Kyle Lowry, but it's ok. The league isn't ready for it.  Edit: I was also low-key hoping Nurse would become the first coach to get t'd up remotely."
whenever i see this i think about the fact that there is NO WAY Kyle Lowry hasn't seen this. Either he's seen it in his replies on twitter or tags on ig or searching his own name or someone he knows has sent it do him... Kyle Lowry has seen this picture and picturing his face while looking at it makes me fucking die
Kyle Lowry robbed. I wanted to see his thicc booty in a tight suit while playing basketball  https://i.imgur.com/B9iIR9L.jpg  I‚Äôll settle for Jean shorts
"Maxxey is going to have to show more potential for this trade to happen without a barrage of first round picks being added. I know that Maxxey had that game where he scored 39 points, but he‚Äôs averaging 8 PPG, which is just not worth Kyle Lowry. The Raptors would undoubtedly take this trade if there were enough first round picks added, say maybe 3 firsts and 2 pick swaps, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a smart gamble for Philly."

Kyle and Fred played together and had a #2 defense. It's fine Lowry thicc
"Agreed, but how trading Kyle Lowry for maxey and picks gonna help them, that‚Äôs a move you do when you plan of rebuilding and focusing on the draft but the raptors are the the 5th seed now either they push for the playoffs or they should try and swap players for other good players"
Head coach Kyle Lowry.  Put some respect on his name.
A nice internship opportunity for Kyle Lowry.
"kyle lowry ain't no spot up coach he aint gotta squat to the corner to coach like hes some Tatum passing option, this aint Nick Nurse this is a fuckin god human Steve Kerr come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the sideline and coach you at the same time"
PLAYER COACH KYLE FUCKING LOWRY
Players too   I remember Kyle Lowry saying he checks it regularly
"there's also been a not so subtle vibe that they're tryna just poach all of our 2019 roster since Ibaka signed there and they're being talked about in Kyle Lowry trade rumors (although not nearly as much as philly or miami, but a distant 3rd place for sure)"
"none of this changes the fact that Lin looked confused, disoriented and overwhelmed trying to run the Raptors offense.  Bottom line is, Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry are much smarter point guards than Lin.    I don't care how many years Lin spent in Harvard.  Lowry and VanVleet are much smarter.  Mr. Lin, please enjoy your time in the G-League getting roasted by such elite floor generals as Malachi Flynn."
FINALLY Kyle Lowry will take over as Player-Coach
I think I would also if Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt available and no deal is to be had there   Gordon is frankly better than Danny green. The issue is the tax whatever ownership says publicly it‚Äôs always on any owners mind. This is frankly part of why the curry/Richardson deal happened they knew Richardson would cost a good bit more than Seth after 2021. Still if they aren‚Äôt cheap I would do it
"Marc Gasol played with Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard.  Jokic plays with MPJ and Murray.   Obviously Jokic isn‚Äôt nearly as good a defender as Gasol but it‚Äôs also hard when every dude and his mum can blow by your guards and you‚Äôre trying to stay out of foul trouble because you are your entire teams offensive system."
a fusion of Kyle Lowry and Steph Curry would be unstoppable
To him it‚Äôs Toronto. He mentioned some time last year that he trashed Kyle Lowry on a podcast and raptors fans were commenting on his page that they hope his 2 year old niece gets raped.
"&gt; But it happened also because there wasn't any good defender in guard position and back to 2000's they were more strict about positions  Yes. This has really changed the past 5 years also. [If you look at the seasons where defenders spent the most time guarding the most positions and showing the most versatility since 2014 its all within the past 3 yrs](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). Ex Kyle Lowry  2014: 64% of his time guarding 1s, 21% guarding 2s, 9% guarding 3s, 4% guarding 4s, 2% guarding 5s  2020: 18% guarding 1s, 34% guarding 2s, 22% guarding 3s, 17% guarding 4s, 8% guarding 5s.   He was guarding Tatum and Jaylen Brown in the playoffs last year, even with these stocky bulky guards this just would never happen 15 years ago.   &gt;Right now he's still a great defender but not remotely as good as he was  Yeah definitely not what he was 5 yrs ago, do think he's definitely better right now defensively than post 2002 Kobe. He earned an All NBA defense spot last yr, I think he's a deserving candidate this year.   Really people think it's more ""virtuous"" or ""superior"" if Kobe was some elite 2 way player his whole career. It's all just signaling really to act like he still played top defense it wasnt actually that important if he did or didnt at his spot it just makes people feel better to claim he did."
"Sure but there had to be more weirdness than what we hear about. It was an all-time weird situation by most accounts. Just starting with the players feelings when the deal went down. There was definitely some tension with guys like Lowry and you can't tell me that went away the second Kawhi showed up. No matter how professional Kyle is he wears his emotions on his sleeve. I remember feeling like it was not a great sign when Kyle was asked at training camp if he reached out when Kawhi was traded to the Raptors and he was like ""nope, this is the first time we talked here"". Thats not what you normally hear or expect in a situation like that. It was weird and uncomfortable and knowing what we know of Kawhi I think he could have operated completely independent of the ""team"" all season and it wouldn't have affected him personally one bit."
Jalen Ramsey and Kyle lowry purely cause they look alike
Steph adds Kyle Lowry to the list of people he wants to work out with in the off-season
"kawhi leonard, kyle lowry and pascal siakam were all playing through injuries that would have kept them out of regular season games"
"McKinley Wright IV, from Colorado. 22 year-old senior point guard, at 6‚Äô0‚Äù and 196 pounds, he should have the size for the NBA- that‚Äôs roughly a Kyle Lowry type build. Wright was a great free throw shooter (84%) on one of the best free-throw shooting teams in the country. He only shot 30% from three, but the good free throw percentage and previous good three point shooting seasons suggest he should be fine in the NBA- even if three point shooting isn‚Äôt his bread and butter. He also had an assist to turnover ratio of 6:2, and really cut down on his turnovers this year. For a guy who‚Äôs floor seems to be solid backup guard and whose ceiling (IMO) is Grizzlies Mike Conley but slightly worse on defense, he‚Äôs getting surprisingly little buzz."
Bah gawd here comes Kyle Lowry with a steel chair
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
"Wall is definitely a better player than Kyle Lowry.  Average around 50% more assists per game, a good 5+ points per game, more steals, more blocks, etc.  They both have an all-NBA appearance but Wall got an all-NBA defense.  Lowry has one more all-star appearance but he's been in the league for 4 more years and didn't miss last two seasons."
Tell me more about Kyle Lowry...
"Take out the 2015 and 2019 finals which were heavily swung by injuries. Even if we include them he's not better than Kyle Lowry or Klay/Dray  The last seven 2nd Best players on championship winning team (with those two exclusions): AD, Curry, Curry, Kyrie, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade  Just stop"
I know the Kyle Lowry pasta. But it doesn‚Äôt make sense here lol
Idk. Kyle Lowry is smaller tho so his Thiccness will be hard to beat. Zion‚Äôs height works against him a little but he could get there. Then he could be the new ThiccLord.
No Thicc only applies to one human and that is the ThiccBoi himself Kyle Lowry.

"You clearly aren‚Äôt using the same criteria to judge that post as the one you initially commented! That states expect to make the HOF if their career continues whereas people are claiming Damian Lillard and Kyle Lowry should be in based off current accomplishments. I don‚Äôt know why you felt the need to comment when it was a personal question on how I would redesign or reallocate the HOF, I assume it‚Äôs because I mentioned the star player on your team but it‚Äôs really illogical."

Kyle Lowry in the Hall of Fame should be a non-starter for anyone who‚Äôs familiar with the history of the game. Raptors fans need to relax.

Kyle Lowry. The dude does everything for a team. His value goes beyond the stat sheet.

Why have we not seen this with Kyle Lowry yet?

"Stephen ""Kyle Lowry"" Curry"
"Silver: LeBron, I heard you recruiting Kyle Lowry  LeBron: No I wasn't  Silver: I was right there. At one of the games. Next to you.  LeBron: Oh you must have misunderstood. I'm recruiting for... uh... Space Jam 2!  Silver: Oh that makes sense.  I know Silver wasn't actually there. But I needed him to make this written skit."
Kyle Lowry and Caleb Martin because they are both 90% ass
"I don't want them to waste Steph's prime either,but it's not like they were a Vucevic or Kyle Lowry addition at the trade deadline away from being a contender in the West. If Klay comes back anywhere near his prime then absolutely they should be willing to move Wiseman and other players to get an all star level player if possible."
Kemba Walker is Kyle Lowry if Kyle Lowry was bad at basketball
"Well obviously, you can read right? The difference is I have numbers to my support my argument where as you don't.   Also It's better to have a higher number for an offensive rating and a lower number for a defensive rating, so Fox doesn't have a better offensive rating than Booker who beats him quite convincedly in both categories. How are you going to call it a ""noisy metric"" when you don't even understand how it works?  According to defensive ratings, Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry are having the worst defensive seasons of their entire careers. Smarts defense has been criticised this season (he's missed 17 games through injury and probably isn't 100%) and Lowry is 35 years old so not an absolute shock to be honest. Jaylen Brown is a very overrated defender. Refer to this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mcn8yw/is_jaylen_brown_an_overrated_defender/). Their are even Celtics fans who are saying his defense has been bad this season. Do your research."
"Cole ""Kyle lowry minus a decade and a half"" Anthony"
Brunson looks like the next Kyle Lowry. They also both went to Villanova. I can legitimately see him become a starter somewhere in a few years.

Kyle Lowry is tsundere
Kyle Lowry
"Wes Goldberg says he was possibly a part of a multi team in regards to Kyle Lowry. It must have been with Miami as I can't really see the front office helping out the Lakers, maybe Philadelphia though? Anyway it fell apart and the back up plan was to keep Oubre lol."
"Overrated by who? By fans or by the general public?  Boban‚Äôs likable for instance but, the memes and random games where he goes 31/18 overshadow the fact that he‚Äôs an absolute sieve on defense.  I guess when it comes to our fans, Maxi was overrated when some fans thought we could get John Collins for Max and filler, though maxi and DFS both fill a great 3&amp;D role and make really low salaries (particularly DFS)  There is about half our fanbase though who hates everyone except Luka, lol. So no danger of KP being overrated. Maybe Brunson if he keeps his hot streak up, but I‚Äôve said before he could potentially be a Kyle Lowry type player."
devin booker received the 26th most all star votes from fans. He received more votes than:   * Chris Paul   * Rudy Gobert   * Ben Simmons  * Kyle Lowry   * Nikola Vucevic   * CJ McCollum   * SGA  I'd say he is properly rated
Kyle Lowry and Luis Scola
And Kyle Lowry will fill that role perfectly next year instead.
And plenty of guards are good well into their 30s. Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry are playing super well despite them both being 35.
"Kyle Lowry was also considered a ‚ÄúB‚Äù tier all star. The thing is...you need exactly that to win a championship. Not everyone can be A tier. That‚Äôs just not how championship teams work usually. I mean, having two A‚Äôs is nice, but without Klay, Kyrie, or Kyle you‚Äôre just not getting it done."
"there would be a sense of irony in that considering conley replaced lowry in memphis, but kyle really only has 3 teams on his list: raptors, heat and sixers."
"&gt;""don't half ass anything, whole ass it.""  Kyle Lowry, probably"
"Yeah, so he'll be 34. Seems pretty standard to retain someone through their early 30's. I see no issue with the length. Would I make current Kyle Lowry or Chris Paul the 15th highest paid guard? Absolutely. But we'll see. It could be a bad contract in the last year"
"30? Kyle Lowry is looking for 25m-30m per year for his age 35 and 36 seasons. There is a long history of point guards producing at a high level way into their 30s. I see no reason Jrues game won't.  Also, with new TV rights the salary cap will likely end up being much larger four years from now."
"I think there's a better player out there to be had. In fact, Kyle Lowry would be better in Conley's place."
"He‚Äôs not over 30, first off.   Secondly, max contracts change year to year, so you can‚Äôt use the actual numbers as comparison. That‚Äôs not how it works.  Anyway...  Chris Paul got a max over 30. Dame Lillard got a **supermax** at 30. Klay Thompson got a max at 30. Kyle Lowry got a max at 30.  If we bump it down to just one year younger...  Westbrook got a **supermax** at 29. John Wall got a **supermax** at 29. Kemba got a max at 29. Steph Curry got a max at 29. Jimmy Butler got a max at 29. Mike Conley got a max at 29.  Should I keep going?"
"You‚Äôre acting like we paid him $250m or some shit  Max contract level players still get maxes at 30 years old. Especially guards. It happens all around the league, all the time. Kyle Lowry is probably going to get close to $30/yr and he‚Äôs four years older."
Kyle Lowry is 35 and getting paid 30 mil.
You think he'll age worse than Kyle Lowry and CP3. Stop this shit. Signing a 30 year old guard to a max isn't a bad move.
"Yeah, Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt just one of the top trade deadline candidates or anything....Chris Paul was wildly ignored in free agency...oh wait."
I think he'll get kyle lowry money
"Ingram definitely made a huge stride but also check out Kyle Lowry, Trevor Ariza and Kawhis single shooting jumps. Their shooting and efficiency improvements from one season to the next I‚Äôd argue are a bit better."

Kyle lowry in shambles...in more ways than one here
Looks like Kyle Lowry has competition
CP3 this year 16/4.7/8.7 Kyle Lowry this year 17/5.4/7.3
It is insulting to CP3 to put him in the same sentence as Kyle Lowry. He is one of the best to ever do it. Kyle Lowry is a nice player who won nothing before Kawhi came to Toronto.
Kyle Lowry is a glorified role player
"Some guys are just born leaders, although they get even better if they train at it. If I was Ant I'd take leadership classes in the offseason, and come back even better on that.   It helps to be the best player on the team but you don't absolutely have to be if you're good enough. Kyle Lowry clearly was the leader of the Raptors over Siakam and Kawhi, despite arguably being worse than them both (arguably because lots of people seem to hate Pascal now)."

Kyle Lowry.  He is not the franchise GOAT. That would be the guy who won us a fucking ring.
"Still its too early to say Lonzo can't be a star he's only 23.   Some notable PGs who didn't make an Allstar team until much older than Lonzo right now   Stockton 26   Nash 27   Deron Williams 25   Kyle Lowry 28   Chauncey Billups 29   Among all of these guys lonzo ranks 3rd in assists, 1st in rebounds 2nd in points 1st in 3p%.   He might not be a star now but its a little early to say he won't be one"
Kyle Lowry
"Dude most people don‚Äôt want to be in many places. Lowry infamously didn‚Äôt want to be in Toronto long term, and ended up being our greatest player ever. Not every city can be LA Miami or New York but over time people grow to love the place they live, like Kyle did."
the raptors without kyle lowry too lol
"There hasn't been a whole lot of parity in the league like there was in the 70s. Instead you have teams that go to multiple finals, back to back championships, even three-peats. We've got dinasties and the greatest teams (and players) in nba history dominating.  Chuck, Karl Malone, John Stockton had to face Michael Fucking Jordan and the Bulls, a team that three-peated on two separate occasions.  AI ended up having to face the dominant Kobe-Shaq Lakers who'll end up three-peating. That decade, in the west, ended up being dominated by the Lakers and Spurs. Also why Steve Nash doesn't have a ring.  And then you have the Big Three Celtics, the Big Three Miami. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant weren't going to beat *that* Miami team.   And then the later half of the decade, you got a team that just broke the record for the best ever regular season record. And then the next year they add one of the greatest scorers ever to their roster. So it's not exactly crazy that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Damian Lillard weren't going to get to the finals having to go through them  And of course you've got LeBron going to the finals every year, Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan's biggest obstacle in the east.  The point is only one team gets the chip. Out of 30. And we've been seeing the same all-time great teams stopping so many MVP-caliber players from getting a ring.   The NBA community's gotten to a cancerous point where players aren't appreciated for their greatness. Instead all we wanna talk about is all time rankings, which is why the media and fans have put so much value on rings.   And then the media wanna complain why these superteams are formed? And then they're gonna talk about how great players like Brodie don't have a ring?? Like damn. Look at the competition they're facing."
Kyle mf Lowry
I wonder what the Kyle Lowry sweepstakes will be if you guys are out. Maybe he signs for a young team that gives him the bag
"I want Oladipo to make it work in Miami. His go-to guy days are probably over, but if he can be a solid 3rd or 4th option with great defense then having him resigned at 28 would be better than getting back into the Kyle Lowry sweepstakes"
"My view without any data to back it up is that scoring guards adjust quicker, the more athletic types or shooting guards in a point guards body. The more cerebral ones like the ones you mentioned or Kyle Lowry for example, guys who excel by making the right reads need more time. There's exceptions like Chris Paul who was great quickly of course."
"We have Randle who sort of plays the same type of role.  I think they could do really well together, but I'd rather focus on a true PG to help the team take the next step.  I'm hoping they throw the bag at Kyle Lowry."
"There are some examples like Steve Nash and Kyle Lowry who were/are late bloomers, but the one that makes me hopeful the most for Wiggins is the similarities with another Top 3 pick in Chauncey Billups, who was viewed as a bust initially but became a very good to great player after landing in Detroit. Often times it‚Äôs the environment and culture that really makes the difference for a player.   What‚Äôs funny is that Chauncey‚Äôs team prior to Detroit was Minnesota. I always wonder if the Chauncey/KG pairing might have made a difference, especially during their run to the WCF in 2004."
Oubre or Kyle Lowry
"LeGM *1 minute later*  ""The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade Kevin Durant to the Toronto Raptors for Gary Trent Junior, Kyle Lowry, Bronny's draft rights, and cash considerations."""
Kyle lowry
Kyle Lowry would be a great pick up for them.
"Okay, but literally people saying Green, in a vaccuum, is equivalent to Kyle Lowry. Not for team fit, not for roster construction, not factoring in asset management, just straight up Lowry isn't an upgrade over Green."
I can understand that 100%. But I mean I meant it literally. I read takes that Kyle Lowry was not an upgrade over Danny Green.
"Problem with Lukas 3 ball is he creates his own shot every single time with a slow ass stepback into a long 3. He needs to play a bit more off the ball and try and get a kick out from Hardaway or Burke. Thing is whenever Hardaway handles the ball he gets tunnel visioned and almost always drives for the layup and when it comes to Burke, him and Luka are never on the court together. Luka would really benefit from having another high IQ guard on their roster like a Kyle Lowry or a Chris Paul who could help produce for him."
Can he gently whisper *Flagrant 2 on Kyle Lowry* as I drift to sleep?
"I went to Wichita State, one cool Fred story I have: I was in the library zoned tf out on adderall working on a paper or something. I finally look up and realize I‚Äôve been sitting right next to Fred for like an hour. I obvi freaked out bcuz in Wichita the basketball team are the only ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù in town. He was using headphones so the barrier for bugging him was high so I left him alone. I then tried to print out my paper, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to use the printer bcuz it notoriously sucks. So naturally I asked Fred. He helped me through it. I said thanks and of course went on and said how much he meant to the city and how he‚Äôs gunna be in the league one day. Ironically at the time I said his game was similar to Kyle Lowry, and we talked hoops for like 10 minutes. Genuinely a good dude."
"What can Lowry possibly obtain in a trade outside of a couple of mid-tier players? There‚Äôs no point in trading a first rounder for him, so the draft stock isn‚Äôt high enough to trade him to a bad team.   That‚Äôs no disrespect towards Kyle, because he‚Äôs a very good player but he‚Äôs too old to be worth much on the trade market. Plus, the Raptors will most likely keep him anyway since he‚Äôs been there so long."
We all know Kyle Lowry don‚Äôt got the flattest pattiesüòâ
Lol. DeMar roasting Kyle Lowry on a triple double night is peak friendship
"Also, if KD and Klay were healthy, I assume OG is healthy too.

"Like, i‚Äôll be sad if Lowry leaves but this season you ca see Fred has stepped up a bunch &amp; has actually been one of the more vocal guys telling Kyle to get his shit together some games even.  Freds got us, he isn‚Äôt scared of the moment. I‚Äôm so fucking happy we locked him on this deal"
I need Kyle Lowry to be in every room I'm about to walk into and hype me up as he's walking out
&gt;DeMar DeRozan congratulates FVV and roasts Kyle Lowry  How many Raptors legends can you fit in one sentence?
"Well to answer that question, I think any team that has to rely on drop coverage is a great example. It doesn't matter what center you put in drop coverage, whether it's Jokic or Gobert, we see those defenses get torn apart come playoff time. And that's not necessarily that centers fault, it's the fact that poor defensive guards can't fight through screens well enough to stick to their man, and leave a ridiculous 2 on 1 task to their big man every play. Gobert's defensive value in the playoffs goes from top 3 in the league (when looking at one number impact metrics) to slightly above average. Now obviously drop coverage is a specific example, but a bad defensive guard can completely erase the impact that a dominant big man has. That's why Kyle Lowry is so valuable for the Raptors, and why Gasol was able to roam and play the way he wanted to. Same with basically any big that played with Chris Paul"
"Yeah that's why I don't think it's asinine to trade Kyle Lowry despite the emotional response this triggers from many Raptors fans. I obviously would ideally want Lowry to retire with the Raptors, but I'm not convinced Lowry is ready to ride off into the sunset quite yet. Wouldn't be shocked if he leaves for a contender on his own volition in the offseason.   If the Celtics can trade Paul Pierce, we can trade Kyle Lowry. But it would be painful, and I would only do it if we got great value back. But I trust Masai in that sense.    Also I love Kyle Lowry but I don't know if even he can turn that Wolves team around."
"I mean, you describe it as ""3 attacks"" but 2 of those were dimes by Kyle Lowry to get him good looks right at the rim."
Playing with Lowry I‚Äôm sure has it benefits. If anyone knows how to defend while being short it‚Äôs Kyle
Kyle Lowry ain't no spot up shooter he ain't gotta run to the corner to shoot like he's some 3rd option bitch this ain't JJ Redick this is a fuckin god human Steph Curry come again only this time he's a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Kyle Lowry or Tony Parker are better examples. Those guys were great PG's who won championships. They could be considered better if rings are what you value.
Kyle Lowry obviously.   I can't imagine the franchise wouldn't wait until Kyle retires to get his number up first.
Kyle motherfucking Lowry
"Anytime someone clearly takes a screenshot of a video but does not post the video clip, I ignore the point.  Still images never tell the story.   [Maybe they didn't post the Simmons video because doing so proves 100% Lowry didn't undercut him, and that Simmons jumped while Lowry was boxing him out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepdO3XSMMM&amp;ab_channel=CliveNBAParody).  But yeah, the guy who threw the elbow to the balls is the clean player in that sequence, gtfoh.  Also the Paul George thing being Lowry's fault is crazy to me, consider George falls and ends up taking Lowry with him (I'm not blaming George for it, he had no intention of bringing Lowry down, but I'm not sure how Lowry is supposed to avoid that).  First video is Gordon, already discussed.  Second (and third) video are a play on the ball, catches Beal in the head - flagrant, not dirty.   Fourth video, are you serious? How do you watch the last replay and call that play dirty?  Lowry is running for the rebound, sees Porter and tries to slam on the brakes to avoid contact, ends up clipping him.  How do you see any intent there?  Fifth video...yeah, a little.  Delly is being a pest and reaching/poking after Lowry calls the timeout, he's got his face deep inside Lowry's space, and Lowry gives him a little love tap.  There's no intent to injure or hurt Delly.  Sixth video...come on.  Really?  Not even dignifying that with a response, if you think Lowry is strong enough to throw LeBron like that.  Seventh video is nothing.    Did you just search ""kyle lowry dirty"" and post the first 7 links without checking what they showed?"

Kyle Lowry has as many dunk contest titles as Aaron Gordon
Gary Payton amd Kyle Lowry   Cp3 and Gary Payton   Shaq And DeMarcus cousins   Tmac and Kyrie   Tmac and Harden   Yao and john wall
Was in the Kyle Lowry bootcanp
"TIL Kyle Lowry, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Pascal Siakam, DeMarcus Cousins are all European"
How else do you expect a 6 foot guy like Kyle Lowry to box out a giant like Aaron Gordon? Its not like Kyle intended to bump into AG's knee. Unfortunate that it happened but I just don't see the flagrant
"Mike and Kyle were both really raw during their time together. At the time, I was upset we traded Lowry and kept Conley. It wasn‚Äôt 100% clear which one was better than the other."
So Aaron Gordon can sucker-check kyle lowry to the ground behind the play and stay in the game  but this gets a tech?
Look at this dude throwing shade on Beno Udrih.  Also technically wasn't Kyle Lowry a backup PG for us?
"It's funny every time you say anything here about Gordon's hit being cheap or dangerous, in come the whataboutism police yelling ""Well What about Kyle in the bubble!?!""  &gt;Either judge both Gordon and Lowry on potential worst-case injury that their foul could have caused  I'm pretty sure we did that for Lowry...months ago, when it happened in the bubble. Gordon's happened yesterday, which is why we're talking about it. Am I not allowed to speak on AGs hit because Kyle fouled him months ago?   Kyle makes reckless plays at the rim to try and stop dunks. He did the same to Donte last week. I'm glad you brought up TJ/Horford because it actually reminds me of young Horford. He wasn't a dirty player at all, but was just sometimes reckless. I remember Al doing that to another Raptor player again after the TJ Ford injury.   That still doesn't change the fact Gordon's hit was pretty dangerous itself and probably warranted a flagrant 2. It wasn't a basketball play and had excessive intentional contact. The original poster called it ""safe"" which is why I responded, as it obviously wasn't."
"Damn, you right. Kyle Lowry is bigger than god"
Fuck Kyle Lowry
Pretty sure it's 1 -1. Kyle did a dumb play in the bubble. And Aaron decked Lowry last night. He twisted his ankle last night trying to drive past Stanley the animal johnson
That would make your team better in the playoffs. It‚Äôs actually hard to understate how much more viable they‚Äôd be against good competition with Kyle Lowry. The Sixers are going nowhere with Ben Simmons as the main ball handler. He can‚Äôt do shit in the half court. Sixers fans continue to delude themselves.
"We don't even need guards anymore. The only real hole in the roster who plays center when embiid sits, and we're not winning shit when embiid sits anyway so it hardly matters anyway. I think we could upgrade from Danny Green but there are guys in shake, Furkan, Thybulle, and maxey on the roster who all want those minutes.   I like Kyle Lowry he's just too old to give up anything serious for him. Him and Ben also hate eachother so there's that."
Kyle Lowry don‚Äôt like you
I do not like Kyle Lowry
Why do you care what people say about Kyle Lowry?
"We're both speculating something that can't really be proven unless Lowry outright says it and I think it helps show their personal beef(from the bubble I think we both agree on that) and that one or both of them weren't just playing ""hard"" against each other, if you disagree that's fine.  Your definition and my definition of aggressive box out are clearly different. Maybe that's because you watch a lot of Kyle Lowry! I kid, but that particular play was still more than just aggressive to me."
"He's the ultimate compliment player. Superstars are the MVP votes getters. The main piece that people build around. Steph and KD are superstars. Klay is a compliment to them. Chris Bosh wasn't a superstar. Brad Beal, Mitch Richmond, Tim Hardaway Sr., Kyle Lowry, Middleton, etc. aren't superstars. Klay has always been efficient and plays good enough D to have made all-defense 1 time. He's 2 times all-nba on the 3rd team. That's not a superstar. Jayson Tatum is closer to being a superstar than Klay ever was."
&gt;always  Either watch some actual raptors games or shut the fuck in about Kyle Lowry
Somehow Kyle still fucking flops! It was a legitimate hit but you seem him take the hit in surprise and then when he realized what happened he intentionally fell the opposite direction to the floor. He can‚Äôt even take a legit foul without overselling it. Hopefully AG doesn‚Äôt face any fines for this. This is less than Lowry deserves for trying to close line Gordon in the playoffs
"Fuck Kyle Lowry, bitch ass actress"
"I mean, Lowry is obviously the first one, but you could make an argument VC is 2nd. Unless there's a really weird off season and we re sign Demar, I don't know who has a better argument for it after Kyle then Vince."
Kyle Lowry has little man syndrome like a MF
do you not think 6‚Äô10‚Äù aaron gordon would beat the absolute shit out of kyle lowry? lol
"Biggest takeaway from this game: Siakam's been dealing with nagging bumps and bruises all season, but said postgame that he's finally feeling more like himself. He was assertive and aggressive attacking the paint the last 2 games, maybe this'll be the spark for him to take the next step a lot of Raptors fans were expecting him to!   I for one don't mind it when he shoots a few open threes when he's being this aggressive getting to the rim and earning trips to the free throw line. It brings another dimension to the offense and other teams simply struggle to guard him when he's made up his mind to get to the hoop.   On another note, I watched both Aaron Gordon/Kyle Lowry plays, and Lowry may have put a little extra into the boxout but if you're Gordon, you can't allow the other team's PG to be boxing you out with his hip. That's just lazy, and then to top it off by blindsiding Lowry on a shoulder check is weak shit. Hope his ankle feels better, but man, this dude isn't ever going to live up to expectations playing dumb like that."

"\*I spent 2 full months making this roster, so please show it some love, download it and share it with your friends\*  This realistic 09-10 Roster includes:   1. All realistic face skins available, as well as recreated faces for players who are not located anywhere in the game.   2. Ratings matched up to 2k10, scaled up. There is a curve, so players who were rated 40-50 may have increased their rating by 15-20, players who were 90 may only have seen a 3-5 point increase in rating.   3. For accurate abilities, I scaled all players ratings on their available player in the game. For example, for Peja Stojakovic, I took his All-Time Kings player skin, and scaled all his ratings down so that his overall dropped from 85\~ to 71. If there is no in-game player to base their rating on, I looked up their NBA Draft Comparison, and used their stats as a basis. So for example, Gerald Henderson's draft comparison was Dahntay Jones, who is in the game. So I imported his ratings, and adjusted them to match Gerald Henderson's rating in 2k10.   4. All their ages, years played, and salaries are accurate to 2009-10. The only issue is that there is no way to scale the cap down to what it was in 2009, so the first few offseasons may be a bit strange as some really good players are being massively underpaid.   5. All of their potential and peaks are based off of my interpretation of how their careers went looking at their nba reference pages, and my personal knowledge. So for example, Kyle Lowry's potential is 90\~, but he doesn't reach it until a few years into simulation. One issue with 2k is that they often start progressing a little bit too early, so I've seen Lowry blossom as early as 2012, but it is impossible to get 2k to do exactly what you want. It's why you see Steph Curry also start improving far too early, sometimes even making All-Star and All-NBA teams in his sophomore year. Also, while players like Tyler Hansbrough or Johnny Flynn may have been drafted high and technically should have a high potential, since their careers went down the drawn I made their potentials as low as possible.    Feel free to adjust and tweak this roster any way you like, but please leave a comment letting me know what you adjusted and your switch username so I can search yours up and see if you made any good changes that I want to keep.     This roster is available to download on the Nintendo Switch, just search ''vince"" under nickname or ""2k10"" under content name.   I am streaming myself playing with this roster all the way up to 2k21, so if you want to watch that look me up at twitch.tv/bigbyrd4"

Yea Kyle Lowry is a notably dirty player lmao. Call him a flopper all you want but he has never been a dirty player
"If you genuinely think that the nba champion, 4 time defensive player of the year, 4 time all star, 5 time all nba, 6 time all defensive team, 2 time rebound leader and 1 time block leader, shouldn‚Äôt be in the HOF you‚Äôre delusional pal. He‚Äôs was as good an nba player as Kyle Lowry is if not much better (personally I think it‚Äôs the latter)"
dont let someone hear you say that though because this thread is vehemently fuck Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry got a voodoo doll
Wow Kyle Lowry is a fucking bitch
"Stop bullshittin, Kyle Lowry is one of the dirtiest players in this league."
Don‚Äôt you know that Kyle lowry is the dirtiest player of all time
"Are you new to basketball?  Guys foul intentionally all the time to ""make them earn it at the line.""    Whether you think Kyle's foul crossed a line or not, it was the correct basketball play to foul in that scenario.  Lowry, one of the smartest defenders in the league, saw that AG was going to score on the play, so he fouled hard.  It was borderline a flagrant, maybe, but nothing super egregious.  Unfortunate, obviously, it always sucks when anyone gets injured... but it happened within the flow of a basketball play.  Some would argue it was dirty, but there is at least plausible deniability, at the bare minimum.  AG, on the other hand, would have been suspended by the NFL for headhunting, after what he did tonight.  Disgusting, immature behaviour that has no place on the court.  You got a problem with what Kyle did?  Dunk on Kyle, drive on him, lock him up, block his shot, take him down low; maybe win the game lol - there are dozens of options to be able to literally body him up within the rules of the game.  Hell, foul him hard on a similar play where Kyle has an open layup, that's fair game.    Instead he took a cheapshot that was in no way related to the basketball game happening around it.  He should feel embarassed."
Kyle Lowry is a POS
We did build around Kyle Lowry and looked what happened? We won the Championship
Aaron Gordon is a saint and Kyle Lowry is the dirtiest player of all time.
"&gt;If it was a boxout then why didn't AG retaliate for the first 1.5 quarters? Why did he retaliate the play after that, and then leave the game because of it...   Players get injured doing routine basketball plays ALL of the time. Are you really using the fact that Aaron Gordon was frustrated, as proof that Kyle Lowry tried to injure him on that box out? I swear this sub's pitchforking has gotten out of control."
" &gt;Why are you bringing up a player from your own team hitting lowry right after???  Because Yuta didn't know who he was boxing out and used the same amount of force.  &gt;Like that has nothing to do with the conversation or the intent that lowry had.  You've already made up your mind that Lowry had ""intent to injure"" on a box out, because you're searching for it.   &gt;You don't box out for .15 seconds.  He bodied him when the ball was clanking off the rim jeeze, how else is he going to prevent him from grabbing that rebound.   Tbh magic fans be more upset at AG for putting his own pride over the team during this game. He'd rather ""get revenge"" on Kyle then win the game. How else do you explain taking an obvious flagrant when you're already losing?"
"Still don't see much.  If anything OG pushed Gordon into Lowry, but even still it looked like Gordon sold it or got tripped up or something. Kyle was literally just boxing out tho, don't see anything wrong."
Post Kyle Lowry hurting Aaron Gordon
"When the player being cheap shotted is cheap shot king Kyle lowry, yeah"
"Kyle Lowry plays very dirty, not surprised AG gave it to him."
"Sure, ultimately this stuff comes down to what you weight in discussing greatness, but at the same time I don't think including him is a particularly egregious take.   Like there's a reasonable argument that Kawhi is a greater player than, for example, Paul Pierce. It's not like arguing that Kyle Lowry should be top 50."
Kyle Lowry has literally eaten charges from Embiid. He isn‚Äôt scared of Aaron Gordon
More dirty shit from Kyle ‚ÄúAnderson varejao‚Äù Lowry
Kyle Lowry trick y‚Äôall man
"&gt; If you have to resort to cheap shots on people you are soft as fuck.   Yah, just like Aaron Gordon did this game. If anyone's on Lowry's balls it's you. You can't even see AGs baby food movements past your Kyle Lowry hate."
"https://mobile.twitter.com/PapageorgiouMBO/status/1356048524497068036?s=20  Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt a dumb guy, he has good body control and great awareness of the court. He knows what he was doing here."
"If you ""genuinely"" can't tell which part of this clip ""even looks like"" Kyle Lowry taking a shot at Aaron Gordon, then there's literally no room for discussion. The homer goggles are on way too fucking tight"
I bet Kyle Lowry had something to do w it. Probably put a voodoo on Gordon
kyle lowry is so smart that he targeted the exact location of AG's knee with his ass without even looking
"Kyle Lowry is like top 5 dirtiest players in the league but you never hear about it because ""hurr durr DAE lowry big butt?&gt;!?"""
Yeah Lowry literally killed him bruh y‚Äôall raptors fans soft as shit Kyle is far dirtier
Gordon looked like he was planning that for awhile. Looks like he got hurt from putting his shoulder into the brick shithouse that is Kyle Lowry.
"those things that don't show up on a stat line ARE important. That's the thing... There are a handful of players in the league that can control a game without stuffing the stat sheet. Lebron, CP3 (still) and Draymond Green come to mind. Kyle Lowry, too (OK. unapologetic homer on that one.) Jokic belongs in that category on offense, at least.  A Lebron lead offense always has every player in his best possible positions and best possible match-up to make the most out of the possession.   It's not an accident"
"Kyle lowry is the greatest raptor of all time, however he was not the most talented. Talent doesnt discard everything he did to destroy our franchise"
"Kyle Lowry is going someplace for sure if the Raptors struggle as they have, maybe more than just him."
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry and Eric Gordon
Oh meant to comment on that one person Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry were 5‚Äô10‚Äù
"huh  \&gt;Kyle Lowry is a free agent but will likely get a bigger deal, Mike Conley is too old, Goran Dragic is too old and Spencer Dinwiddie will be coming off of an ACL injury. For the price that Lonzo would cost, it is clear that he would be the best option for the Los Angeles Lakers."
Yea Kyle Lowry is definitely more impressive than LeBron being the best player in the world
Even someone like Kyle Lowry. Mike Conley.
Post game interview he says twice he didn't do anything wrong lol not that he didn't say anything.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/video/kyle-lowry-addresses-4th-quarter-045319268.html

"‚ÄòHow are the players supposed to know what they did wrong?‚Äô Dude... they‚Äôre NBA players. This isn‚Äôt pee-wee soccer where refs explain decisions to little kids for educational purposes. They know the rules and I bet Kyle Lowry knows exactly why he got a tech, even if he‚Äôs denying it in the media.  If every player could question every decision made by a ref with no consequences the games would take days and we‚Äôd have arguments at every stoppage. Anyone who‚Äôs played sports is taught at a young age that the refs decision is final and if you argue back or are disrespectful about it, there are consequences. This is the case in almost every sport in the world.  I don‚Äôt sound dumb, you sound like you‚Äôve never played organised sports before, and if you have, you were taught etiquette poorly and you‚Äôd be a nightmare teammate. If I‚Äôm a raptor I‚Äôm looking and Lowry getting ejected in a close game and thinking ‚Äòwhy couldn‚Äôt you just keep your god damn mouth shut and play‚Äô"
Kyle Lowry is the NBA version of Nelson Cruz
Official post game referee interview transcript  QUESTION: Did you give Kyle Lowry a second tech because he got a phat ass?  REFEREE: That‚Äôs correct.
Some of our fans really are. This season has brought the worst out of our fan base.           But I definitely agree with you. I also think you guys will get Kyle Lowry for either free or S&amp;T this offseason.
Kyle Lowry is a terrible comparison
Kyle Lowry
"Let's start a petition to rename any Philly v Miami game the ""not overpaying for Kyle Lowry bowl"""
"From a numbers standpoint he was more like Steve Nash or Deron Williams.  If you want a modern comparison, Kyle Lowry.  Regardless of how often people say it, there was no Curry before Curry.  I hate that narrative, it really undersells just how much Curry innovated and changed the game."

"Honestly Raptors could get a nice squad: Damon Stoudamire, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Antonio Davis Andrea Bargnani, Jonas Valanciunas"
Kyle Lowry
&gt;Khris Middleton   &gt;   &gt;Kyle Lowry   &gt;   &gt;Joe Ingles  You can't tell me which one of these is the definitive #1 on the team though
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
"Man that‚Äôs how I got into basketball. Yao, T Mac, Shane battier, Luis scold, Aaron brooks, fucking Kyle Lowry."
"Kyle Lowry was better and more impactful, but Pascal was definitely their second scoring option."
Oh you mean when Kyle Lowry was their 2nd best player and won them game 6 and not Siakam
kyle lowry too
"A ton of credible media guys said Kyle Lowry was on the verge of being traded, but one of the 5Reasons guys took that to a whole new stupid level and tweeted out ""Lowry to Miami"" as if the deal was done. Tweet deleted now of course"
"Oh god, didn't 5 Reasons also say Kyle Lowry was on the verge of being traded to Miami?"
"We don't need Kyle Lowry, we'll get Oladipo instead.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Man it's really pretty sad how many Raptors fans come out of the woodwork to trash Casey for his time there.  Apparently his failure to beat Lebron with Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan is basketball's greatest crime.
"Late career Iverson, like in Detroit or Memphis hurt teams because he became a black hole and still didn't score much. OKC/Houston Melo is an example of the same but much more extreme. Glad Carmelo found a place again.  A not so good player can be any leader or dependable role player. Horry comes to mind as the obvious examples. Those championship Rockets had a few not so good guys that were important. Mario Elie and Vernon Maxwell weren't technically the best players but they knocked down shots and were hard nosed guys who made their team better. All stars but not superstars like Chauncey Billups or Kyle Lowry also are big reasons those teams were succesful in the postseason."
Kyle Lowry
"That's where ""scoring option"" and ""best player"" differ.  Kyle Lowry was the second best player overall on the championship team and the best player overall on the team last season, not Siakam."
"&gt; The Spurs had the greatest PF of all-time and the second greatest player of the 21st century thus far. The Bulls had the greatest scorer in league history. The Lakers had prime Kobe, one of the best scorers in league history and a top 12 guy all-time. The Warriors had Steph, and while he wasnt a designated elite playmaker, him and Dray are definitely both way better playmakers than a guy like SGA lol, and their system was specifically tailored to put Dray's playmaking to use  Bruh if you don‚Äôt have a top 5 player in the league then you don‚Äôt really have a chance at a championship  so that goes without saying.   Warriors didn‚Äôt design for dray lol - they used all their bigs(Bogut, Lee specifically) as playmakers/screeners on the elbow and Draymond was the best among them - the load was still distributed between him, steph, iggy, bogut, Livingston to an extent too.   &gt; The last team to win without a clear top 15 player of all-time? 2019 Raptors with an elite playmaker in Kyle Lowry.  Depends on what you mean by elite - lowry never was a floor general type even though he‚Äôs a great playmaker. They had FVV, Marc Gasol, Kawhi and Siakam all avg 3+ APG.   &gt; Before that, we have the 2011 Mavs because you can argue Dirk isn't top 15. Elite playmaker in Jason Kidd.  &gt; Before that, we have the 2008 Celtics. You could make an argument for KG in the top 15 ig, but definitely not close to clear. Anyway, Rondo was an elite playmaker.  Bruh what are you trying to say? It goes without saying that without an MVP level player no team has a shot at a chip. An elite playmaker isn‚Äôt gonna move the needle much if you don‚Äôt already have superstar talent.   &gt; These teams obviously had multiple guys that can create offense for others. But they also have a primary playmaker who they can trust the most. The type of the thing the 2020 Clippers lacked. And if you don't have one of the greatest players ever to carry a greater load, you're probably gonna need a good floor general.  If you don‚Äôt have a legitimate superstar, then a floor general won‚Äôt help your championship odds much either way. I assumed that didn‚Äôt need to be said."
"Yeah, when your team has a particularly extraordinary player.   The Spurs had the greatest PF of all-time and the second greatest player of the 21st century thus far. The Bulls had the greatest scorer in league history. The Lakers had prime Kobe, one of the best scorers in league history and a top 12 guy all-time.

How would you ever be able to tell with a Kyle Lowry profile picture which team I root for.
Kyle lowry wouldve yoted it
FUCK KYLE LOWRY
Kyle Lowry in shambles
FUCK KYLE LOWRY
Kyle Lowry in shambles
Huh? Kyle Lowry is tryna play for the Clippers? Hmm
"[\[The Athletic\] The Lakers were willing to trade away Dennis Schr√∂der and KCP for Kyle Lowry. However, **the sticking point in the trade was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/mdbymq/the_athletic_the_lakers_were_willing_to_trade/)  Lowry, Caruso, Wes Matthews, and Mclemore&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Schroder, Caruso, KCP, Mclemore, THT, and Matthews"
Kyle Lowry?
So your case is that Kyle Lowry is so good that he should be looked at as fondly as Eric Bledsoe?
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
Kyle Lowry anywhere outside Toronto
"If we're willing to be (very?) charitable to OP, Kemba *might* decline quickly. He's good now, but he just turned 31 and is a relatively small point guard so there's a chance he falls off very quickly, but maybe that happens next year or maybe it happens in 5 years.   Can Kemba have a favorable aging curve like Chris Paul or Kyle Lowry and play well into the second half of his 30s? Sure, it's possible, but the more typical outcome is that under-sized guys drop off pretty fast."
"For all we know, he can become a late bloomer like Kyle Lowry"
"I'm a fan as well but that's because we've had Kyle Lowry for a while. He bricks it a lot but that's an okay ""free"" shot to take."
"Naw, Lowry has been battling a right foot infection since 2 months now. [https://ca.nba.com/news/kyle-lowry-how-long-will-the-toronto-raptors-guard-be-out-injury-timeline-latest-updates/1kmeur9dzos6j1wmul54rs6jam](https://ca.nba.com/news/kyle-lowry-how-long-will-the-toronto-raptors-guard-be-out-injury-timeline-latest-updates/1kmeur9dzos6j1wmul54rs6jam)     Nurse said last week, the injury is worse than they thought. He re-aggravated it during the Lakers game two weeks ago."
"&gt; I don't think Terry's additional offense negated Beverley's defense  This is getting sus. You try to hand-wave 2019 Ingram with 2021 Wiggins, and now a washed JET with Pat Bev on Steph? Come on, you're better than that.  You're conflating 2015 Warriors with 2016 Warriors. The big 3 all took a significant step within that year, but they were quite vulnerable in 2015. Reminds me of the Rose Bulls that could have won championships if teams in their path were injured, but otherwise got stomped by full strength Heat in back-to-back years.  Again, hypotheticals. I'm only bringing this up because I'm predicting the future will come full circle.  &gt; Curry was more transcendent than KD, especially in that series. Even if you don't like the more impact based advanced analytics, the basic numbers for KD was pretty bad that series whereas Steph's were much much better.  You can beat that horse to death like Ben Taylor, or you could view KD as the more dominant player in the 2017/2018 finals and 2018 HOU series. Steph had his chances to outshine KD while on the same team but didn't. I'd rather build a team around KD, but I wouldn't go so far as to say KD is significantly better than Steph.  &gt; Bron gets credit when they play well and his teammates get criticized when they lose.  When do LeBron's teammates get criticized? There aren't even that many chances for that to happen because LeBron wins so much. No one blamed Wade or Bosh for deteriorating in 2014. No one blamed Kyrie or Love for getting injured in 2015. No one seriously blamed JR Smith for letting a game go into OT. No one blamed Ingram/Lonzo for getting injured. The most hate LeBron gets is for that China comment, which isn't basketball related.  On the other hand, Warriors fans be scapegoating a rookie and crucifying Wannamaker for the team's troubles lmao. And despite all that, the team still hovers around .500  &gt; You talk about Ben Taylor as if he's some Twitter troll  Ben Taylor can be wrong about some things, and it's obvious he has a contrarian opinion regarding Steph. Who the fuck would make a video on how one superstar makes it so easy for another superstar? He seems to imply think Curry is #1 while Durant is #2 instead of a 1a/1b relationship and Curry fans take that as gospel to evangelize. Do we say the same about 01-02 Shaq/Kobe or early 80's Magic/Kareem? There are two MVP-level talents on the same team, yet one is significantly more important? If that were the case, then both wouldn't be MVP-level talents.  &gt; The gravity and team impact are substantiated by the film, ORTG, adjusted +/-, and record.  Except it's not. Film is simply hand-selected clips prone to confirmation bias. Everything else cannot successfully filter out multi-collinearity, which is why advanced stats is hand wavy at best. If Steph is #1 in RPM but Kyle Lowry is top 5, then you need to defend both those rankings.  Gravity has been disproven this season. If you say Curry is why Durant was more efficient in GSW than OKC, then surely Curry should be elevating his current teammates to great heights then, right? And surely KD shouldn't be this efficient on the Nets?  &gt;  You forget that Curry having a low salary made the KD signing possible.  There was a 35% cap spike, so virtually every team could have signed KD, but he chose to go to an existing contender while they kept every all-nba talent. Completely unprecedented. It'd be like 96 Shaq joining the Bulls.  &gt; How is that different from the Heatles Big 3 taking pay cuts so everyone could get signed? It was still roughly 3 max contracts (Bron, Wade, Bosh vs Klay, Dray, KD) yet one is considered as luck.  First, Warriors had roughtly 4 max contracts.  Second, the 2011 Heat were pretty damn thin and had a skeleton crew outside the big 3. It's only in the later years where the likes of Ray Allen and Battier joined on min deals to create decent depth. The Warriors added ring-chasers like David West immediately.  Most importantly, there's something called opportunity cost. The 2017 Warriors basically dropped Bogut and Barnes for KD while being able to extend everyone else on Bird rights. A championship team is typically over the cap and would only be able to extend existing players and offer exceptions. But the Warriors freaking signed an MVP talent while keeping the championship rotation intact. Completely unprecedented."
Who are Miami going to target in FA? Kyle Lowry according to some reports or is he too old for current Heat roster?
"50% of LeBron coming to the Lakers probably does have to do with LA but the other 50% has to do with Magic and Rob convincing him. There is no way LeBron comes to the Lakers if Jim Dumbass Buss and Mitch Kupchak were still running shit. From 2013-2016 they struck out on every big name free agent (Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron who they were going after in 2014, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and Kevin Durant didn't even wanna give them a meeting in 2016). Magic and Rob changed the FO culture and just in time too or else we wouldn't have LeBron and AD"
lol its originally a kyle lowry copypasta i think. felt fitting in this scenario since Poole hit the half court shot tonight
"Maxi Kleber is stupid hot. Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio are really pretty. Kyle Lowry has that butt. Blake Griffin, I can't unassociate from his scene in Broad City."
Trying to think of anyone who comes close. Nah nothin. Kyle Lowry maybe but he's so far behind still
Don't think they should pursue Lowry. I love Kyle but he doesn't fit their timeline.
Kyle Lowry is one of the best late bloomers in recent memory
"Yeah but this is a problem in basketball discourse, most talented player isn't necessarily best player.   KD was absolutely the most talented player on those Warriors teams, but that doesn't mean he was the best player.  The best player on a team is the most important player, the one that the team can't stomach their loss or they drastically suffer in terms of W/L record, the player that impacts winning the most. There was never a point in time where DeMar DeRozan was better than Kyle Lowry despite being more talented and putting up superior stats. There was never a point in time where Blake Griffin was better than Chris Paul despite being more talented and putting up superior stats, similar story with Devin Booker this year. Donovan Mitchell is not better than Mike Conley this season, despite being more talented and putting up superior stats.   KD has never impacted wins/losses as much as his reputation has suggested he has, the reason why nobody ever talks about it, is his most glaring weakness (playmaking and creating for others on offense) has been covered up by the fact that he's played with an MVP point guard for the entirety of his career who has fulfilled that role."
Kyle Lowry
NOt sure if this counts but Kyle Lowry was clowned for being a perennial playoff choker and now he's fine I guess?
"The headline is just saying the Knicks are targeting these players, not that they'll sign there. Besides, it's not like 35-year old Kyle Lowry or Dennis Schroder are exactly star players"
"Try to turn Bledsoe, Lonzo, Adams into:  Myles Turner, Kyle Lowry  Maybe a sign and trade featuring Lonzo/Adams to get Lowry this offseason, and then whatever you need try to get Myles turner while also getting rid of Bledsoe. Gonna have to throw some picks in to get him.   Ideally that turns your starting lineup in New Orleans into:  Kyle Lowry, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Myles Turner  That is certainly a playoff caliber starting 5, maybe even a team that can get home court advantage. At that point you need to fill in the bench. I'm not educated enough on their bench pieces now to know who is worth keeping, but Lowry and Turner would be my Plan A."
Playing like Kyle Lowry is nothing to hang your head about!
Kyle Lowry at this point
"Wait, explain to me how Kyle Lowry wasn't a top 25 player that year? He made the all-star team which consists of 26 players alone (2 of which were honorary retiring players). He was also second in assists that season, IDK how you don't see him as top 25 that season."
poor man's kyle lowry
Kyle Lowry is Canada's asset
"Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby"
"These the weirdos who make post like this to make a good player seem worse  ""Ay who's better Kyle Lowry or Stephen Curry"""
Kyle Lowry or abella danger
Lebron and Kyle Lowry been doing this for 10 years
Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry on the 2016 Hawks instead of Jeff Teague. They still wouldn‚Äôt beat Lebron anyway but it would have been fun
"I think it's more just a downstream effect Embiid taking up a bunch of F votes might affect the candidates at the F spots. But yeah it's not a big deal  I do think if we are letting Embiid be counted as an F we should really just do away with positional designations at this point for good. Outside of the true Cs everything else is interchangeable. Even guards like Kyle Lowry will spend playoff series guarding Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, technically they are playing a ""forward"" spot defensively those times. Doncic counts as a G, Ben Simmons counts as a G but LeBron has to count as an F, it's all just arbitrary as hell."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"Kyle Lowry was considered a coach killer in Houston and the trade was a ""get rid of him"" move."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
Not sure if Kyle Lowry wants to stay ‚Äúon the road‚Äù after his playing career is done; but the guy is very smart and able to connect with players. He would definitely make a good coach (at least as an assistant).
i think that whatever kyle lowry gets will serve as the framework
good thing y'all kept him and all the other young dudes over kyle lowry LMAO
"No, he‚Äôs actually been decent, just an off night  For Kyle Lowry tho? Yes"
"Right , when he was in Toronto it felt like he was the main scorer and Kyle lowry was the team leader . When he was in San Antonio he still had  Ginobili and Duncan leading the pack ."
Kyle Lowry.
Dont forget kyle lowry. He is probably one of the best in flopping.
"[This stupid shit by Kyle Lowry](https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2020/02/screen-shot-2020-02-25-at-7.02.17-pm.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=600&amp;crop=1) is even more important to Raptors history than the Larry OB, TBH."
"and they sat Kyle Lowry for.... rest?  No, Nick Nurse actually said he's fine and able to play but they just want to see what the other guys can do.  He said it was a choice by him, Masai, and Bobby Webster... You really can't get more obvious than that."
"Both had career year's in 2016-17, wall was All NBA 3rd team, Kyle didn't make all nba   Wall: 23.1 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 10.7 APG, 2.0 SPG, 0.6 BPG, 4.1 TOPG on 45/33/80 splits   Lowry: 22.4 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 7.0 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.3 BPG, 2.9 TOPG on 46/41/82 splits  My opinion is that Wall's peak was higher, scored + assisted more on better defence"
Someone explain to me the whole keeping Kyle Lowry and then sitting him 60% of the games strategy
"That is pretty much what being the second option is. It literally means ""the second option to score"". Siakam in the 2019 Playoffs averaged 16.0 Field Goals Attempted per game, second on the Raptors behind Kawhi Leonard (20.7 FGA/G) and ahead of Kyle Lowry (11.6 FGA/G). Tell me, how can you take 4.4 more shots per game than the third highest on the team and literally double of the fourth most on the team (Serge Ibaka, 6.0 FGA/G) and you not be the second option?  Imagine lying about Siakam being the second option when he was LITERALLY the second scoring option on the Raptors."
Kyle Lowry
"4 years ago he was a rookie/sophomore, so no. It took J Kidd years to become a great shooter. It took Kyle Lowry years to breakout as a great player. It Rose multiple teams to come back from his injury.   None if this stuff is overnight. That's why it takes so long for players to improve FT%. He only shoots as well as he does from 3 and other places because he picks his spots. It is more beneficial if he drove more. That'll cause more pressure from defense and open things up. He'll score more too."
&gt;No one goes on YouTube to watch Kyle Lowry highlights lol.   Im gonna do this out of spite now üòÖüòÖüòÖ
"‚ÄúThe biggest thing is he‚Äôs a super-positive guy,‚Äù Nurse said ahead of the NBA All-Star Game in February. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the guy sitting next to me when I‚Äôm sensing disaster going on in a game and he‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna win, we‚Äôre gonna come back.‚Äô Constantly, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna do it, we‚Äôre gonna come back.‚Äô And that helps me out quite a bit.‚Äù  Kyle Lowry, who can be harder to please, was succinct in his praise.  ‚ÄúI would say he is the fucking man,‚Äù Lowry said.  ""Nate is the [expletive] man,"" said Raptors guard Kyle Lowry. ""He's always that positive, happy go-lucky [guy], always looking at the plus side, not looking at anything negative. We need that.""  Lowry is not alone. Fred VanVleet called Bjorkgren ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù and called rumours he could head to Indiana ‚Äúwell deserved.‚Äù  ""I think Nate's fun,"" said Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. ""I hear him all the time in my ear talking about something. Every morning he'll say hi to you and give you a dab. He's present and I think his energy is felt and needed on this team. He's a great guy to have, a great coach and somebody who is a likable person and so serious about his job.""  u think people here just made things up and ran with it? lol"
"&gt; still playing the position.  Again, this even further the point. He's a passing SF who controls the ball, I'm not denying that, but he's not a Point Guard, he was not playing the position and he especially wasn't viewed that way.   2016 for example, here were the East Starters:   - Dwayne Wade - Kyle Lowry  - Lebron James - Paul George  - Carmelo Anthony   There are two people on that list far more qualified to be labelled a Point Guard then Lebron. And it's ridiculous to act like that's not obvious.   Just because Lebron passes, does not mean he's a point guard in comparison to the leagues *actual point guards*. He's a Small Forward whose a great passer."
Kyle Lowry will be forever underrated because he isn‚Äôt flashy. No one goes on YouTube to watch Kyle Lowry highlights lol. CP3 on the other hand...
"He thicc tho, not Kyle Lowry thicness but he ain't moving that easily."
"For myself, its difficult to understand how Kyle has only received 1 Allnba and 0 Alldefense selection given the consistent success he's had over the past few seasons. IMO if you took the past 5 years and averaged out each players ranking each season, Lowry would be in the top 15.  But, since we have to define allnba team by postion, you end up with stupid shit like DeAndre Jordan on allnba 1st team in 2016."
"&gt; Not at all. Pascal Siakam was MIP and second team all NBA. Devin Booker will be neither. Kyle Lowry wasn't considered their best player, Siakam was. CP3 is considered the Suns best player and leader. This could be bias but the difference in perception matters.  Yep, that's true. It's moreso that there was a misperception about who the best player on the team was last year (it was still Kyle), so the all-nba went to the perception. But at the same time the team had very even strength among its top seven players, so we were performing not really off the back of one player."
"Not at all. Pascal Siakam was MIP and second team all NBA. Devin Booker will be neither. Kyle Lowry wasn't considered their best player, Siakam was. CP3 is considered the Suns best player and leader. This could be bias but the difference in perception matters. Also, CP3 joining the team turned them from a 10th seed to a first/second seed. Completely different circumstances. Only similarities are point guard. CP3 also is shooting way better than Lowry did while turning the ball over way less."
"Yeah man Kyle lowry famous ""meaningless stats"" player lmao"
hes the best athlete with big ass since LeBron.  it looks like Kyle Lowry doped by Russians
Kemba Walker ü§ù Kyle Lowry  Apparently being too old to have any value
It‚Äôs Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry
In no particular order. -Ben Simmons -Joel Embiid -Steph Curry -Jaylen Brown -Kyle Lowry
If he wins a ring as a lead guard or important piece the narrative will completely flip. He‚Äôll become the nba darling. Lots of people what on Kyle Lowry for years and once he won they all shut up. And Kyle isn‚Äôt even half as polarizing as Westbrook.
i feel like he's gonna have a kyle lowry type of timeline as an NBA player
"I would've said Kyle Lowry if it weren't for some of the BS hail mary shots he's made, he's never been much of a highlight reel player outside of those."
"He‚Äôs at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He‚Äôs at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He‚Äôs at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn‚Äôt worth anything close to what he‚Äôs making. He‚Äôs turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don‚Äôt make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."
"honestly wiggins still hasnt peaked since it normally happens when players are 28 or 29.  Frank Gore had a weird career because he didn't fall of a cliff at age 30 which is normal for most running backs. If I had to choose an nba player that was similar, I'd choose Kyle Lowry, but this is prolly a dumb comment"
&gt;Ohh word teams will just e-transfer Masia for the FREE agent Kyle Lowry next season. I  Have you never paid attention to NBA free agency before?
If Ben Simmons died and Kyle Lowry as a middle schooler took his place I think they get an extra 5 points per game
"It‚Äôs not like playoff rotations are much more than that. Your role players were dogshit against the Suns and you think trading them away would give you *less* continuity. Ok lol.  Kyle Lowry is phenomenal, maybe the Warriors should‚Äôve been built as more than 3 players deep. They were getting lit up even when Klay played. Fraudulent dynasty if you ask me.   Only difference was KD, but everyone on the planet cried about how unfair that team was anyway"
If only they knew how valuable kyle lowry would be for them.
Ohh word teams will just e-transfer Masia for the FREE agent Kyle Lowry next season. I
So did Kyle Lowry but nobody wanted to pay that bum a max contract
Kyle Lowry might of helped you cheap fucks
"Imagine if they had a Kyle Lowry, they could probably even win a ship this year."
No.. Kyle Lowry woulda made them legit contenders this year and with all the injuries this could have been phillys year. Lowry would have joined Philly and been there best shooter and that‚Äôs not even his best trait.
With the other teams maybe they don't win. But if the Sixers had Kyle Lowry right now they would be beat g the Hawks and with Kyrie out would be the favorites in my opinion.
Hey one of those picks could be great! They could even be as good as Kyle Lowry!
"The had the opportunity to trade Maxey,Thybulle, green and a first for Kyle Lowry but the though they were good with Simmons as a play maker.."
Sixers were a Kyle Lowry trade away from winning a championship and politely declined lmao
"Kyle Lowry wouldn‚Äôt have let that collapse happen, just sayin Philly"
I mean the team that kept Kyle Lowry is also eliminated.
"Jesus, imagine trading for George Hill instead of Kyle Lowry. What a laugh."
Kyle lowry was right there for them lmfao
Can you imagine Kyle Lowry on this Sixers team with the way the playoffs have played out? They‚Äôd be a huge title favorite IMO. Go fuck yourself Morey.
"Hey sixers bros, would this be happening if you had Kyle Lowry on your team? Just curious"
I was told Kyle Lowry wouldn't help the Sixers
This is getting ridiculous.  Why didn't Philly get Kyle Lowry?
Kyle Lowry is on the raptors just an FYI
That would be a better technique for Kyle Lowry. That big ass would draw so many fouls.
"Yeah, I'm familiar with this story. He wasn't dunking and it was against all medical protocol. Here's the reality, Kyle Lowry was 19 years old at this time, not 29. And  he had clearly built enough strength in his posterior chain that he didn't even need to rely on an ACL. But he was playing with fire and in college. If you're paying an athlete 32 million dollars, you don't let him play with fire.  This is the [same shit that Dejuan Blair](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/11/how-can-dejuan-blair-play-without-an-anterior-cruciate-ligament-in-either-knee.html) had. He had zero ACLs in either knee but he was playing NBA basketball. He'd built the strength and was young enough that his brain was able to build the proprioception to function without ACLs. The term used to describe this is  ""ACL coping.""  If Kawhi Leonard has anything beyond a grade 1 sprain or requires surgical intervention, he will not be playing basketball for 6-8 months and won't return to the NBA for 9-12 months."
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
For some reason in 2k last time I check he‚Äôs still an 80 or a high 70 lmao. The likes of Andre Drummond is an 83 the same rating as kyle lowry lmao
foul baiting is an art.  there's a difference between flopping and just being in the right place to take contact.  kyle lowry has made a career of diving into position in the paint to draw charges.
Excluding those years he still shot 38% from 3. And if he was raised in today's game and focused on it more I think he could maintain that even at higher volume. I'd say a slightly better Kyle Lowry from 3.
Kyle Lowry?
They need a veteran guard that can run the pnr IMO. Just need to settle down and try to generate good looks through screens and ball movement. Someone like Chris Paul or Kyle Lowry would be a godsend for this team.
Kyle Lowry should've been all NBA last season if CP made 2nd team
"When the Raps played them in the playoffs, we were massively undersized. There were times when the shortest player on the court for Philly was Jimmy Butler. Ben was never really an issue even when being defended by 5'11 Kyle Lowry..."
Something along the lines trade Kyle Lowry because Fred VanVleet is just as good or OG can be the next Kawhi (I too dream of this but I know it's a homer take)
"Imagine if you had actually traded for Kyle Lowry.  But nah, Maxi's tooooo good. This was probably your only shot at a championship, and it's going away."
"They really should've gotten Kyle Lowry  Thybulle's value worsens as you can't really play him next to Ben Simmons for extended minutes, and Maxey's been a non-factor. With lowry they would've been championship favorites right now."
I made a joke and you made it into going at Kyle Lowry.  Dweeb.
A team that has a two time mvp on it isn‚Äôt comparable to one who‚Äôs best player is Kyle Lowry or Paul millsap. Is that hard to understand ?
How many times has he even said that? Always boggles my mind that so many raptor fans are assholes to Kawhi. Guy took renowned playoff choker Kyle Lowry as his his second best player and won the only championship in team history
Kyle Lowry doesn't have that impact in his best season let alone at 35.
"It's not the same. Typically when you talk about a shot creator it's more like a guy who can handle the ball and create a shot for themselves. I guess I could have been clearer.  Think about the role Jimmy Butler used to play for Philly.     Of the guys you listed below, Tobias is really the only passable example you guys have and he's decent not elite.   Elite offensive teams have multiple guys who can put up 15-30ppg mostly scoring off the dribble.  1. Giannis, Middleton, Jrue (and even here, Middleton is often their best half-court shot-creator over Giannis)  2. Durant, Harden, Kyrie  3. Westbrook, Beal  4. Donovan, Conley, Clarkson, Bojan, Ingles   5. Dame, CJ, Powell  And it becomes a lot more relevant the deeper you go into the playoffs because the game slows down and you lose a lot of other scoring opportunities.   Philly is pretty short-staffed in that regard and it means Embiid has to do more on his own because he can't just give the ball to someone and let them lead while he has a break.  * Simmons struggles in the halfcourt * Tobias gets stopped too easily * The shooters need help getting their shots off  &gt;We have a lot of shot creators with off ball movement  You need additional scorers who are more than glorified wide receivers who 'make plays' by getting open.   &gt;second half it wasn‚Äôt there  That's because the game is slowing down.  Typically basketball slows down later in the game and later in the playoffs. When the game really slows down is when you really need shot creators.  This is why Philly keeps hitting these invisible walls after looking dominant all season and in the 1st round.   It's also why Kyle Lowry was such an exciting trade prospect for Philly this season. Replacing a shooter or two with a guy who can shoot **and** create would have had a huge impact on your half-court offence."
"Huge mistake Philly not picking up Kyle Lowry, Embiid deserves better"
"where's the video of that copypasta, I think it's on Kyle Lowry. I need help finding it"
"Embiid's dives this game were bullshit, and that's from a huge Kyle Lowry fan. The sequence where he pushed a player under the basket, got tapped and dived the opposite way and got the foul was ridiculous.  Great game."
Difference is Lowry was in the prime of his career in 2016 at age 29. CP is doing this at 35. Kyle is my fav player but the Point god is a different level.
"That was such obviously bullshit posturing from the beginning though. If a ref thinks a player's flopping, then simply don't bail him out with a foul call.  What amazes me is that no matter how many times Trae Young, Marcus Smart, Kyle Lowry, et al. play them for utter fools, they're never reticent to oblige."
Kyle Lowry takes a charge in angry protest
When did lebron play a two time mvp in his prime ? The best player lebron beat in those playoffs was Paul millsap Rasheed Wallace and Kyle Lowry.
Harden hasn't even done it much this year lol. I always thought Kyle Lowry and D.Wade were the worst offenders of this. Oh and Jamal Crawford
Kyle Lowry and Trez could put put them into win now mode if they can get them
"For re-signing with the Raptors, Kyle Lowry could get free chicken for life from a Toronto restaurant. And if you know Portuguese chicken in this city, you know that's nothing to turn up your nose at.  [Churrasqueira Martins](https://www.blogto.com/restaurants/churrasqueira-martins-toronto/)¬†owner Rui Martins announced the offer through social media last week, filming himself in front of a giant downtown billboard reading ""Hey Kyle Lowry, if you stay we'll give you free chicken for life!"""
"I really wish I had the time in my day to refute all of your shitty takes regarding Schroder and Lowry. You place too much emphasis on meaningless regular season games. The fact of the matter is Schroder gets exposed for what he really is in the playoffs. Good players wilt in the playoffs and great players raise their game. Give me Kyle Lowry 15/10 times. And you said old small players don‚Äôt succeed, take a look at Chris Paul you fucking wack job."
Kyle Lowry.  And better stats too
"If I was Denver, I‚Äôd probably trade MPJ while his stock is high. I‚Äôd look to see if I can package him in a deal to nab a veteran all-star similar to how CP3 made the Suns elite contenders. Bradley Beal? Malcom Brogdon? Kyle Lowry?"
"Flopper, sometimes dirty, extremely competitive to the point of it being unlikeable sometimes. But I'm also describing my favourite PG of all time in Kyle Lowry, so I'm rooting for Suns!"
"I think the three days off between series really, really helped him. He said he was talking to Kyle Lowry who experienced the same injury recently and the real key was just rest."
Best Raptor: Kyle Lowry  Best Player While on Raptors: Kawhi Leonard  Best Player Who Played on Raptors: Hakeem Olajuwon
"Kyle Lowry may be the lesser version of Chris Paul in many ways, but for two heaving, crucially important reasons Lowry will always be better."
"Kawhi might be the best player to ever play for the Raps, maybe. But he will never be the Rap's best player. They were a stop on his journey.  Kyle Lowry means more to the that franchise than any other player will for a looooong time."
Gonna yoink the Raps all-time starting five;  Kyle Lowry  Vince Carter  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Chris Bosh
Jonas ‚ÄúBig Science‚Äù Valanciunas  Kyle ‚ÄúThe Bulldog‚Äù Lowry  DeMar ‚ÄúDeebo‚Äù Derozan or Comp10  PJ ‚ÄúThe Lebron stopper‚Äù Tucker  Demarre ‚ÄúJunkyard Dog 2.0‚Äù Carroll  Pascal ‚Äú Spicy P‚Äù Siakam  Fred ‚ÄúVanFleek‚Äù Vanvleet   Malachi ‚ÄúRed Vanvleet‚Äù Flynn  Stormin Norman   CJ ‚ÄúKilometres‚Äù Miles
"That's true. Isn't Kyle Lowry one of them? Still, I don't see 'Te improving much more than he already has"
"Kawhi has played on teams with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Paul George.  Now we're expecting KD to prove he's a ""superstar"" by winning a series where his second best player is probably Joe Harris. This narrative is weird as fuck."
Kyle Lowry is an amazing player but no Raptor fan has pretended he was KD. Lakers being delusionally toxic 101
With people like kemba and Kyle Lowry potentially up for grabs? Yea he's probably gonna regret it
"&gt;like maybe Kyle Lowry.  Lowry is 35 years old, wants $25M x 2 years, and has been a net negative on Toronto for 3 of the past 4 years.  There is literally no precedent for a 6'0"" 35 year-old guard being worth the equivalent of $25M/year in the NBA.  Old small players just do not succeed at that level in this league."
They literally run no kind of action in their half court offense and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating to watch. They try to run a pick and roll with Middleton and Giannis but you can tell they‚Äôre both not suited to doing it. Instead of trading for a combo guard like Jrue they should‚Äôve really went all in on trying to get Chris Paul or even Kyle Lowry.
"Most men in their 20s are pure ego so him turning down $84 million doesn't surprise me that much.   A rule of thumb is that if you haven't been selected for an All-Star game or first, second or third all NBA team, you should take the money and not wait for the offseason.  That said we should resign him for $45-50 million if we can't get Kyle Lowry."
"All flop team:  C - Joel Embiid, PF - Lebron James, SF - James Harden, SG - Marcus Smart, PG - Trae Young, 6th Man - Kyle Lowry. Team goes 16-0 in the playoffs."
Kyle big booty Lowry
"Ideally we‚Äôll sign and trade him with our first round pick for a better fit, like maybe Kyle Lowry."
"No, it was over 4 years  &gt; The most that Schroder can extend for under his current contract is four years, $84 million. What I have been told is the Lakers did indeed offer him that $84 million over four years ... and he said no. He said no to that extension. And subsequently the Lakers offered him in trade for Kyle Lowry.   (Literally from the article)"
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
"Correct, my bad. But still, he was basically Kyle Lowry (when he first joined the Raps) at that point of his career: Definitely not an all star, but pretty good. He was on 4 teams before catching on with the Pistons. He didn‚Äôt even make an all star team until 2006."
AD had an all-time run last year ...  &gt; needs a LBJ or CP3 or someone to run the show for him  or like a Kyle Lowry or a Tony Parker ?  &gt; They probably don't make the finals with AD  What a stupid take. They almost beat Boston and Boston should have beaten Miami. You don't think adding AD is enough to flip the series ?
"I‚Äôm not sure why the same clause wouldn‚Äôt be triggered... maybe so the teams losing the player at least have a chance at recouping some value? Your guess would be as good as mine here.    As for the Lakers... I think Schroder ends up getting signed and traded. I have two destinations/scenarios in mind.    Mavericks receive: Dennis Schroder    Lakers receive: Tim Hardaway Jr.    Dallas gets another ball handler to take some of the workload off Luka, Lakers get a knockdown shooter to pair with LeBron and AD.    This next one is a little creative:    Knicks receive: Dennis Schroder    Raptors receive: assets from NY    Lakers receive: Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry has never flopped or committed a foul in his life
"This is the site the tweet references.  It offers no sources, and its literally just says ""Dallas just got eliminated, Lowry can help"".  https://ahnfiredigital.com/nba/dallas-mavericks/report-dallas-mavericks-trying-to-insert-themselves-into-kyle-lowry-sweepstakes/amp/?__twitter_impression=true  Anyone know what RDAmbition thinks if all this lmfao?"
DAE think Kyle Lowry has a fat ass and Luka is classy?
"No he was a third option. Half of his points came from Kyle Lowry. No one really game planned for him, he went off once per series then disappeared."
I didn‚Äôt ignore when he injured Klay. Probably the biggest play of his career cause it gave Kyle Lowry a chip.
"It's mental.  And I don't mean something so vague as ""he doesn't want it enough"" because they all do at that level.  For the great players, the game slows down in their heads and they can make the right decision or even position their body the right way in order to make the best play.  Look at someone successful that doesn't have AG's physical gifts. Let's say Kyle Lowry. Check out how many layups he gets even if he's shorter than most of his opponents and doesn't jump high. He can use his body to get leverage so that his opponent can't  block him, which he does because he gets a read on his opponent's body position.  Let's take for example someone successful that DOES have his physical gifts: Giannis. When he slashes to the basket he makes the read on where his opponents are gonna be based on their movement and euros away from there. He can read when the play isn't gonna work and remembers his teammate that was headed to the wing that he can pass to, even though he wasn't looking there at the time.  Court vision, reading and reacting, it all happens in a split second in the mind. Not everyone can do it."
"His inefficient ball hog style of play contributes little to winning so I don't really have to appreciate it. He represents the exact kind of player I despise; a selfish player whose negative BBIQ hurts their team. I prefer players like Danny Green, Rudy Gobert, Kyle Lowry, smart players who know their role and don't harm their teams by shooting 47% TS."
"I think they are similar as you can give them the keys to the team but not necessarily be the best player on the team. Kyle Lowry is another guy I think of that fits that mold. But if any of those guys are the best player on the team, or on a team without much depth, they likely aren‚Äôt a playoff team."
"To this day, [this Lowry moment brings a huge smile to my face.](https://i.imgur.com/lPmo0z1.jpg) Your description nailed it perfectly. The pride and joy you get from watching a player that you've seen work his ass off for your franchise, finally get over that hump, is immeasurable. As much as Kawhi was the MVP of that Raptors run, I think I can speak on behalf of all Raps fans when I say that we were mostly excited and happy for Kyle than for anyone else on that team."
"His lack of shooting hurts him. We also never get to see what a peak Rose would look like since he got hurt so many times, so his MVP season was his best version of himself.    IMO, many versions of Curry and CP3 &gt;&gt; Rose.   I‚Äôd take Dame too. Dame‚Äôs shooting just gives him a big edge over Rose. I‚Äôd also lean Westbrook. Rose wasn‚Äôt any more athletic or a better scorer or passer than Russ.    As a secondary option, I‚Äôd much prefer Kyrie too.    If you count Luka and Harden as point guards, then they‚Äôre also clear choices to take.    IMO, Rose would need a very specific roster construction. In those ideal constructions, he‚Äôd be a poor man‚Äôs Wade or LeBron. Wade is bigger, stronger, scores better and more efficiently, and a better defender. Same for LeBron, but his vision and IQ are another level.    Honestly, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry would fit many rosters better than Rose. I‚Äôd obviously rather build around a talent like Rose if healthy, but Conley and Lowry are proven two-way point guards who can stay healthy (at least much more than Rose) and don‚Äôt require the ball or need a ton of spacing to be very effective."
"&gt;Kyle Lowry finally getting to the NBA Finals  I 100% agree.  [As a Jazz fan, ‚ÄúJohn Stockton sends the Utah Jazz to the NBA Finals‚Äù is my favorite NBA moment of all time](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kGtGQQUMDjs)  Stockton, Malone, Sloan...they spent SO MANY years fighting and struggling to get to the NBA Finals.

And as a Jazz fan, you felt every inch of their pain and joy throughout the years BECAUSE they were the embodiment of the Jazz through and through."
"@wojespn: ‚ÄúKevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and Joel Embiid have signed with the Seattle Sonics, with Kyle Lowry likely to join on the veteran minimum.‚Äù"
Kawhi isn‚Äôt good enough to lead a team. He ain‚Äôt vocal enough he could use a Kyle Lowry type
He‚Äôs shy. Does he have a Kyle Lowry or Freddy van fleet to pass to him? Need a all-star guard.
Not everyone is as unselfish as Kyle Lowry unfortunately
"Obviously I was my comparing Giroux to Sid, or really anyone. But I think he‚Äôs better than DeMar. DeMar is a low efficiency high volume scorer. He was mr the best player in his team, because he had an elite playmaker in Kyle Lowry. Giroux led the league in assists one year"
"For now.

"I think what bores me the most about modern superteams is the lack of connection between the players and the team. I love seeing fan-favorite players win with their teams after years of trying. Kyle Lowry finally getting to the finals with the Raptors was one of my favorite basketball moments of all time, the look of joy on his face when he finally made it was amazing. I don't think it would have been the same if he had forced a trade to join up with some other all-stars. I think it's why KD was never really satisfied when he won those rings with the Warriors, he finally made it to the peak of basketball achievement but it didn't mean as much as it would have if he won with the Thunder, both to him and the fans. I can't fault players or franchises for trying to win a championship at all costs and I'm happy for Clippers and Nets fans that have had to take shit for a long time, but something about these superteams feels hollow to me.   This model of superstars in their prime forcing trades/signing with a team in free agency and then that team auctioning off all their young talent for other superstars/vets looking to win a ring just bores me. If the Clippers or Nets win a ring I won't be filled with rage or swearing at my television, I'll just be bored. Before anyone says it, yes I'm sure if the Hawks traded off all of their young players for superstars and won a ring I would be happy. But it wouldn't be the same as if we won with our young core now."
"Kyle Lowry! Shot maker, play maker, can and has completely changed the tempo/outcome of a game just by taking charges. Absolute bulldog who makes winning plays on both ends and in different roles. He can fit into almost any team composition."
"&gt;I think they can get Lowry for the MLE, if Kyle doesn't mind losing ~$10-15M if it means competing for the championship in the last couple of years of his career.  Lmfao"
Kyle Lowry.
So you said 2019 in the previous comment and now you‚Äôre talking about 2020 but I‚Äôm the one who needs to get years right? Not to mention in 2020 both Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry made the all star game (Siakam as a starter too! He had a fantastic season).
Oh now Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry aren‚Äôt stars at all? Next are you going to tell me that Siakam was actually paraplegic the whole time?
Is the Kyle Lowry half court buzzer beater forgotten? If so that one
Kyle Lowry and FVV are both  shorter with a shorter wing span than Sexton.

Lowry is about to get a 4 year bag that halfway through the first year people will realize he did not deserve and never should've been given to him. It will be the anti-CP3 contract.  Easily the most overrated player of the last decade because Kawhi carried that team to a championship while he was still the same old Kyle playing like dogshit in every game 1 and 2 of that playoff run.
"ugh  Kyle Lowry is legit though, imagine being chased by a bum team like NOLA. no future there, hope it doesnt happen"
Kyle Lowry
Lol we‚Äôre ‚Äúracing‚Äù for Kyle Lowry now?
And this one isn't a particular moment but an entire game and it was watching Kyle Lowry step up in the biggest game of his career in Game 6 vs The Warriors!
Maybe they will let CP3 walk and become the 10th team in the kyle lowry sweepstakes
Jrue didn‚Äôt match your timeline but reports are that y‚Äôall are going after Kyle Lowry this offseason lol
"I'm a (Raptors) homer and don't think Lowry is as good as Chris Paul, but you're not doing Kyle justice comparing him to Fred.   One of Kyle's go-to moves is to dribble along the baseline and try to make a play from under the basket. His handle is tight enough that he can operate in a crowd and find his slasher (e.g. Boucher). Fred does exactly what you're describing though. He has low efficiency at the rim and tends not to facilitate from the paint.   It's interesting to consider which parts of Kyle's game are better than Chris's though.  He's a more versatile defender since he's quite a bit stronger (+20lbs) and defends much larger players.  The uniqueness of his charge-drawing also allows him to protect the paint against bigger players.  I think his other main advantage is that Lowry plays a strong transition game. He inbounds as quickly as he can, he runs, has his QB passes, and does his pull-up transition 3s. Chris Paul walks the ball up on almost every single play."
I rather we try to throw some money for Kyle Lowry if we have to acquire someone
Kyle Lowry twerking
"There it is, [the new hollinger article](https://theathletic.com/2713807/2021/07/19/2021-nba-free-agency-point-guard-rankings-by-bord-chris-paul-kyle-lowry-top-a-deep-field/) values Schroder as $11.3m and predicts him to get a $35m/3 or a one year deal to reset his value."
Why would ANYONE in their right mind who wants to contend.. want a dude like Kyle fuckin Lowry on their team? That dude is a dead beat PG and a role player at best
"I love what Rose did for the Knicks this year, but I can't put him higher than Lowry. If his career hadn't been derailed by injuries, he probably would have surpassed Kyle overall. It's a shame.   The Jackson hype is overblown. He's 31, and his career averages are 12.6 PPG, 4.2 APG and 2.9 RPG. Which is fine, but even during his peak playoff performance this past season, he's only averaging 18 points a game! He's a fine player, but Lowry he ain't."
"And that's coming from a guy who would take Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson or John wall over Kyle Lowry. Absolutely garbage take. Basketball is more than regular season offence. What other PG in the last 50 years can be switched onto an all star 7 foot centre and make them pass the ball out instead of posting up? What other PG of this generation can take a charge, get a steal, hit a long range pull up 3, and run a pick and roll alley oop to perfection all in a 3 min span - and that's a normal night for him? Have you ever actually watched an NBA game before? My god."
"3 1st picks that all led to generational talents. 2/3 got traded and I expect the 3rd to be on his way out soon considering the Williamson family is silently acting like Lavar Ball. The most cheering you do is for players you trade away.    You're trying to replace Lonzo Ball with Chris Paul/Spencer Dinwiddie/Kyle Lowry who are not coming to NOLA. Considering the overlap of Saints fans, I'm surprised that Pelican fans talk about their franchise like they have any hope. Your offense has no shooters and your defensive effort is pitiful at best. It should've been a big red flag the moment we traded you the 4th pick, and you somehow turned it into Jaxon Hayes and then go out and sign Adams to an absurd extension the following year."
"Not Kyle Lowry. Ima need picks or something to make that happen. They need to sweeten that deal big time. From there 4/80 is the most I'd give, and I don't want him on my team."
"Randle takes a step back next season, as does the team defense as thibodeau's style starts to wear on players.  They miss out on all of their big name targets and Thibodeau is fired in the offseason.   Ben Simmons is traded to Portland for CJ which ends up benefitting neither team.  Philly and Portland both end up in the play in tournament.   The Chicago Bulls end up with Kyle Lowry and the number 2 offense behind the Brooklyn Nets and end up with a top 4 seed in the east.   De'aaron fox makes his first all star appearance beating out Shai for the final spot.   Myles Turner leads the league in blocks, makes his first all star appearance and wins defensive player of the year.   The Phoenix Suns make their second straight NBA Finals appearance.   Kyrie Irving gets red hot in the NBA finals as defensive attention is given primarily to Durant and Harden and Irving walks away with Finals MVP."
"The funniest part of the 2019 ring is that I watched the majority of experts pick Philly, Milwaukee and Golden State at the time, but now looking back everyone calls the Raptors a superteam. Make it make sense.   Kyle Lowry has been a great player for years, and he's going to the HOF. He's not on CP3's level, but calling him serviceable is ridiculous. You can't show me ten point guards better than him right now."
"One benefit of Lowry is he‚Äôs a decorated vet and vocal leader. This benefits all teams but i would be especially given Ingram‚Äôs grumbling, they want a senior voice to bring it all together and be the guiding force. Ingram will be better for this.  It‚Äôs a nice fit for Kyle."
"They can for example trade lonzo into NY capspace, stretch Bledsoe, trade Adams and #10 to Toronto for Lowry and then sign Demar.  Kyle  Demar Ingram Zion Somebody  Fred Suggs OG Pascal Adams, GTJ #10  Both teams get better now in the ways they need to."
"1) Lowry has never been as good as CP3 so stop the comparisons there. Not to mention the Suns roster top to bottom is just better than the Pelicans.  2) he‚Äôs about to turn 36 ‚Äî that means he is going to get worse. If a team signs him to a 3 yr, $75 contract, they‚Äôll be paying a 38 year old $25M the same year Zions contract extension is due.  3) Lowry does not put them over the hump in the west. They‚Äôre still a borderline playoff/play-in team with Lowry.  4) If you sign Lonzo for the same price, he might not only be a better PG than Lowry within a couple years but easier to move. You can actually get something in return.  5) your top two stars are publicly lobbying for Lonzo to come back  6) Kyle Lowry would never in a million years sign with the Pelicans over the Knicks, Bulls, or Heat unless they significantly overpay which means he‚Äôd be owed even more at 38 y/o  So what was that shit you were saying ü§î"
So you‚Äôre willing to pay a 35 year old Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶ but not a 23 year old Lonzo Ball?  Am I missing something?
Am I the only one who unironically believes the Sixers would have won the championship this year with Kyle Lowry?
"Reggie Jackson 2020-2021  * 10.7 PPG * 3.1 AST * 2.9 TRB * .554 EFG * 3.7 WS in 67 games  Kyle Lowry 2020-2021  * 17.3 PPG * 7.3 AST * 5.4 TRB * .546 EFG * 4.1 WS in 47 games  Even if you switch to per 36 numbers Kyle is comfortably ahead. If you're arguing that you'd rather sign Reggie for the next 5 years, fine.  Reggie had a good playoffs, but Kyle Lowry is comfortably several notches better than Reggie Jackson. [Expert opinion and upcoming contract value](https://theathletic.com/2713807/2021/07/19/2021-nba-free-agency-point-guard-rankings-by-bord-chris-paul-kyle-lowry-top-a-deep-field/) will bear that out."
Yeah that's what I'm saying.  Reggie Jackson stepped up his game this year to the level that he's better than Kyle Lowry.
"Lowry isn't as good as Reggie Jackson.  Kyle Lowry, is not as good as Reggie Jackson.  KYLE LOWRY, is less GOOD than REGGIE. JACKSON. is what you're saying."
Yeah this would be weird to me because tbh we aren‚Äôt a Kyle Lowry away from being a legit team. Idk what he would do for us outside of being a consistent like7-8 seed
Keldon Johnson kind of looks like a stretched-out Kyle Lowry
PG: Kyle Lowry   SG: James Harden   SF: Zion Williamson   PF: Cristiano Felicio  C: Nikola Jokic
Don't they kind of need KCP though?  I would think they can't afford to lose another wing unless they get back a player on the level of Kyle Lowry.  Do you think the Raps would want Kuzma and KCP in a S&amp;T if they can't get much draft capital in return?
Never noticed how much Favors looks like Kyle Lowry
"Lowry is the toughest get but also the most pointless. Why in the world would the Bulls want a 35+ year old kyle lowry? He's not chris paul, and the bulls are not the 2020 suns."
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
Kyle Lowry is not going to the Chicago Bulls.
"You really think that? Getting Kyle Lowry would get us veteran leadership that we need, as well as PG that can create for others in the half court."
this why kyle lowry have a ring and chris paul don't
Kyle Lowry?
"I mean what's the list? Giannis sure, gobert sure, then it starts getting slightly murky but still I'd say Ben Simmons, and embiid. 5th I think I'd be fine with tho unless I'm really forgetting someone. Kawhii,kd,LeBron all can be better but don't have consistent defense effort anymore or ever. Cp3 would probably be an honorable mention, kinda Kyle Lowry but he is lower down at like 8/9 to me.  Ohhh ad is above Simmons below embiid or whatever order but better as well.  sorry jrue is 6th."
Decent chance he will end up with less rings than Kyle Lowry
Chris Paul wants to be Kyle Lowry so bad
"i need an impartial take, is kyle lowry as annoying to watch as booker with the constant complaining to refs? I think kyle complains louder but not as often."
Kyle lowry disagrees
"EAST  - Giannis wins a Championship with the Bucks - Bulls eventually trade Lavine - Cavaliers make the playoffs once - Ime Udoka doesn't last as Celtics coach  - Capela is still a Hawk  - The Heat never make the finals again - LaMelo gets 3rd team All NBA honors - The Knicks never win a playoff series  - Jonathan Isaac never gets healthy  - KD wins 2 titles with the Nets - Goga Bitadze is the next Gobert - Isaiah Stewart leads the league in rebounds at least once - Vanvleet will be the only Raptor still with the team - Sixers sign Kyle Lowry - Somehow someway Bradley Beal never leaves the Wizards   WEST  - Lillard never leaves Portland - Paul George is still a Clipper - Jaren Jackson Jr is a bust - Gordon Hayward returns to Utah - The Kings still haven't made the playoffs, Fox gets traded to the East - Lebron surpasses Kareem as all time leading scorer and retires as a Cavalier - Luka and Mavs never makes it past the 2nd round  - Michael Porter Jr leads his team in points - Zion never participates in dunk contest, Pelicans make it to the playoffs twice - Rockets never make it to the playoffs - Gregg Popovich retires in 2 years - Mikal Bridges wins MIP - SGA demands trade from the Thunder - The Wolves finally make the playoffs at least once - Steph Curry leads the Warriors to the finals but loses"
Kyle Lowry
"36 year old Paul, Booker and Ayton are in the championship.  The Blazers with tweaks and breaks could get there. Are they every year bonafide contenders? Prob not.   Forever it was trash bro. Kyle Lowry. Till he won.   One deal that involves CJ and is an upgrade could turn things."
especially when the owner gets involved  remember when the Knicks agreed to trade for Kyle Lowry but Dolan stepped in and stopped it because he was afraid Masai Ujiri was somehow going to make the Knicks look foolish after fleecing them for Andrea Bargnani?
Ass - Dr. Kyle Lowry.
Even Kyle Lowry is pushing it even though he might just sneak in and you want Danny Green lmao ?
Because he was injured? Why didn‚Äôt the raptors win a chip before he was there. You can‚Äôt seriously be saying Kyle Lowry who isn‚Äôt even a top 200 player off all time is better than kawhi

"This is an interesting take. I like it. I also see you‚Äôre a Raptors fan. Kyle Lowry was all about DeMar DeRozan for years and years. They had a famously good rapport. But you see where I‚Äôm going with this. Now maybe Masai Ujiri was able to make that particular trade work with SAS, and nothing of the sort has presented itself to the Blazers since Aldridge left.  Maybe.  But I could imagine Dame getting frustrated with the FO not at least building assets for trade even if nothing happened. It‚Äôs cliche because every team did, but we know they passed on Jokiƒá in the draft because he was 2nd round. I bet Dame has looked at a lot of closer examples of a better player at the same or similar position falling in a draft for a guy who didn‚Äôt even play year four in Portland.  I also don‚Äôt think guys like Lillard are in the self-reflection business. I think you‚Äôve got a good point, that if he‚Äôs blocking a trade for CJ they could only really trade or add starting front court players to affect real change. But that sounds like something Dame will reflect on later in life.  Right now, the team isn‚Äôt one move away, and even if they took those moves it would hobble the team‚Äôs future to take a chance at Win Now with maybe one new star and most of the pieces already around him. Meanwhile he could go to Philly, Milwaukee, maybe Toronto, or a half dozen teams in the west, and at least be better positioned immediately."
"Gonna focus on the UFAs here because they're the ones I feel that I have the best bead on  1. Kyle Lowry - I know the Heat and the 76ers are the most commonly linked teams here, and I can definitely see that. However, I'm gonna go a little different here and suggest that **Portland** will end up working a sign-and-trade for him (maybe in a 3 team trade, since they'd likely need to trade CJ in order to make this happen). With all the rumblings that Dame is unhappy coming out, I think it's a foregone conclusion that they're going to try and make *something* happen, and I think this is probably one of the bigger ones that they could realistically swing. While this definitely still leaves the Trailblazers small at guard, this now gives them someone that they can reliably put on elite guards on defense, which I think has shown to be pretty critical at this point.   2. DeMar DeRozan - DeMar's the hardest one here to pinpoint, IMO. He's still a great player, but his skillset isn't something a lot of teams are looking for at his contract expectations, and I'd imagine he wants to go to a legit contender (or as close to a real contender as he can). For here, I think he ends up going to **Dallas**. The Mavs biggest problem (IMO) this playoffs was how much their offense stagnated when Luka wasn't on the floor. No one else was consistently creating their own shot, and no one else really looked great running the offense. DeMar fixes both of those problems, and lets Luka maybe not be on-ball quite so much when they're on the floor together so that he can conserve his energy a bit more.   3. Richaun Holmes - I think Holmes either ends up in **Charlotte** or in **Atlanta** (but if and only if they don't re-sign Collins). Both of those teams have plenty of cap, likely won't be in contention for the tippy-top of the FA class, and (again, presuming Atlanta lets Collins walk) would have great setups with a player like him given how great Ball and Young are at playmaking while having a hole that would certainly need filling.  4. Dennis Schroeder - I don't know why, but I have a distinct feeling that **New York** ends up signing him. I hope I'm wrong because I think their fans have suffered enough and because I like the foundation for the team they have, but overpaying a mediocre player like Schroeder because you have the cap to do so and feel the need to ""improve"" your playoff team is very much something that sounds like a Dolan thing to push for. They also likely need to go for a PG in either the draft or FA, so there's an actual need there as well.   5. Kelly Oubre - Last and arguably least on this list, I think Oubre signs with a team that's willing to make him a focal point on their offense, who in turn will be angling to trade him at the deadline for assets a la Marcus Morris in his stint with the Knicks. Simply put, after how he played with the Warriors this season, I don't see a legitimately good team wanting him at his pricetag now, but that definitely changes if he looks like he did in Phoenix when he was used as a major part of their offense. That being the case, I'm looking for a team with the cap space, no one that's really a clear-cut top option on offense, and most importantly is in full rebuild mode. To that end, I think **Orlando** makes sense as a destination. They have the cap space to sign him, would likely have the possessions to give him to rehabilitate his perception a bit, and would certainly be willing to part with him for draft assets later on in the season if he lives up to that role.   A little unconventional in parts, I admit, but I wanted to avoid going too milquetoast with my predictions here."
Kyle Lowry
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe? Different era.  &gt; Joe Johnson  [One of the first high profile cases on small market teams having to pay non-deserving max contracts to land meh talent](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/414272-atlanta-hawks-ink-joe-johnson-to-119-million-over-six-year-deal)  Literally goes against the argument you are trying to make.  &gt; Steve Nash (prime)  Sure fine  &gt; Tim Duncan  Drafted on a team and won a ring in his second season.  The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.  Next.  &gt; Yao Ming  lol he agreed to a 4 year max after not playing for a year with foot surgery.  Chinese national I don't think playing for NY is exactly a priority anyways  &gt; Dwight Howard  I mean.. i guess  &gt; Kevin Garnett  I mean he left Minnesota (small market) team for Boston (big market) team so idk..  &gt; Kevin Durant 1.0 free agency (picked Dubs over NYC/LA, who had space and wanted him)  This is the absolute dumbest thing I have ever read.  The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."

"I personally think that's an overly optimistic view and that even if it's done in the context of a Kyle Lowry deal, someone else can outbid that Wolves package to be the team that gets Simmons  Not saying that you should trade Ant for Simmons; I understand giving up your prize rookie isn't really a fun thought but of all the teams in the league, I think Minnesota is probably one of the best possible landing spots for Simmons. KAT and DLo are both offensive-minded players and Ben Simmons could be the defensive engine for that team. The ages for the core line up and Simmons is under team control for a while which is a plus for Minny.   You guys are in a good position to win and I think Simmons helps your chances more than Ant. If you can keep both? Awesome, I'd be super happy for your fanbase, you guys would deserve it more than most. But if the price to get Simmons is Ant, I think it'd be hard to say no personally. But hey I'm not a GM!"

Im still wondering if Kyle Lowry will get traded to his hometown Philly and then maybe Ben Simmons in a 3-team trade somehow... probably not idk
"On behalf of the Toronto Raptors, we are willing to trade Kyle Lowry and Aron Baynes."
"Myles Turner, Harrison Barnes, Kyle Lowry"
"According to Sam Amick, Lowry was *almost* a 76er at last years deadline &amp; the Raptors have the 4th pick for any upcoming deals - [The Atheltic](https://theathletic.com/2478518/2021/03/26/why-no-kyle-lowry-trade-got-done-and-a-closer-look-at-the-ones-that-did-amicks-nba-trade-deadline-reflections/)  Simmons to the Blazers was already touched by David Aldridge too - [The Atheltic](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/nba-rumors-blazers-catch-heat-ben-simmons-damian-lillard-trade)  In the end, all these deals appear to have had some traction outside of just the *blog bois*."
"I'm gonna begin by saying I don't hate Casey, he was a fantastic coach and probably one of the best in handling egos on a team and allowing his guards to grow into great players.  I'm also not a professional sport analyst so please don't take this as a word of someone who knows too much.  It's hard to say if Casey would find success with the Kawhi team.  Casey has shown he's pretty reliant on guard play back in toronto so Ibaka would probably not see the ball or time and we would definitely be seeing more of the office run the high post pnr which we seem to never stray off of.  Kawhi would definitely be playing all game and same with Lowry.  It'll be a real test of durability.  Another thing that has bothered me about him is his defensive schemes and rotations.  It's always been man to man.  That year the raptors held back a lot of teams with a ton of help defense and betting on the weakest shooter to beat them.  Casey believes in his players and would often not change the coverages for 4 or 5 plays.  Cade will flourish in Detroit - I can imagine him being a taller more athletic Kyle Lowry under Casey."
"Kyle Lowry for MVP (2016-17), Siakam winning MIP twice"
Brah Kyle Fucking Lowry still exist Jerry You dumb fuck
"Barnes projects as an 18/5/5 wing at best, his passing skill is underrated. Suggs could be a 20/8 PG with incumbent Kyle Lowry aging. I'd go with Suggs"
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
Kyle Lowry aint no spot up shooter tho
Ever heard of Kyle Lowry?
"brook helps rim protection but is not an enormous upgrade over bam at that and is worse than bam/draymond at post defense and switching.  unfortunately he may have the worst height-to-rebounding-skill ratio in the league, the guy has averaged *five* a game over the past five years, which is literally the same as 6'0 kyle lowry and chris paul have. Myles Turner is slightly better on the glass but is the same archetype, stretch rim protecting big, below aberage on the glass. If they need pure rebounds they need Allen.  Funnily enough, Russell Westbrook averages more offensive rebounds per game than both Lopez and Turner, which is insane. He averages more boards overall than anyone on team USA including Bam and is the nba assists leader, he might literally be able to play point center for this team lmao"
Man I really want to like booker but he‚Äôs like Kyle Lowry level of bitching about calls in his first playoffs ever which is absurd.
"&gt; that MIGHT be a hint that he belongs on the team because of how good he was!  See, you keep missing my point entirely. I've not once said that Carmelo was bad. Or that he didn't deserve to be on the Olympic Team. He deserved to be on the team then the same way Bradley Beal deserves to be on the team now. Or how Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry deserved to be on the team in 2016."

this why kyle lowry have a ring and chris paul don't
Kyle Lowry All-Star game dunk
"Oh god so much worse. No Kawhi and Reggie Jackson &amp; Batum are free agents. Unless we get OKC Paul George (which is still totally possible) or we figure out a trade for someone like Kyle Lowry, we will be fighting just to not be in the play-in next year"
"Raptors fan here. For me they got to trade Kyle Lowry to take advantage of the value he still has. If they don't do that, their next season will be similar as 2020-2021."
35 year old Kyle Lowry would've dunked that shit
Sixers were a kyle lowry away from still playing right now imo.
Kyle Lowry value getting higher &amp; higher
My Kyle Lowry &gt; CP3 agenda flourishing
Kyle Lowry would never
Something is wrong with his hand. There was that report he called Kyle Lowry for tips (presumably because Lowry had a bad hand during hte championship run and had to adjust his game)
That was the worst missed call I have ever seen. Worse than the Kyle Lowry kick 3 vs the kings.
Yeah Lakers lost their 2 best players and people want Kyle Lowry to carry the load of 3 good rotational players in the regular season
Sexton and Garland both participate in the 3 point contest  Kyle Lowry ends up on the Heat and helps them make it to the 3 seed  Ben Simmons plays center on his new team  Rockets make the play-in but the Pelicans don‚Äôt
"Yes, but if nobody offers him any kind of big contract then he isn't going to walk for less money elsewhere. He has to get at least one big offer to make his threat to walk credible, and he'll be competing with a bunch of other free agent point guards: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, etc. Kemba Walker could also easily be had with cap space if some team wanted to take him off OKC's hands. I think the odds of Schroder getting a big offer this summer are small."
Kyle Lowry too low
"Think that has more to do with Ja being overrated than Swipa being underrated. I mean there‚Äôs no chance Ja is a better PG than Kyle Lowry rn, let alone the 6th best PG in the league."
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn‚Äôt - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
Where'd Luka go? And im taking Jamal Murray and Kyle Lowry over Westbrook too
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
"That Kyle Lowry would make 6 straight all star games. In 2011, he was a 25 year old solid starter , not close to all star potential"
"Agreed. I remember making a post here after the Raptors won in 2019 about how Kyle Lowry had the top stat line in game 6 after having laid an egg in the first game of the playoffs with 0 points, and even people in the comments pointed out how CP used the info on IG mere hours after without credit. So I reckon it‚Äôs been happening and they‚Äôre doing it with impunity."
"True and real, can anyone point me to the PG13 bad or the Kyle Lowry thicc threads pls"
Hot take(?): Kyle Lowry has the best intangibles of any non-allstar player today.
Kyle Lowry

This one is legendary on r/torontoraptors  &gt;kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
Kyle lowry is the 3rd best pg in the league over the last 10 yrs. only cp3 and curry have been better
kyle lowry aint no spot up shooter
Kevin Willis entered the league in 1984 and retired in 2007. Kyle Lowry was in the NBA in 2006-07. Im sure you can find some very good player who retired in 1985 who shared a yr with Willis. The one I initially googled Elvin Hayes just missed the cut averaged 28 a game in 1969 but retired right at 1984.
"I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Mini-Lebron has always been Kyle Lowry."
"Bagley still has so much time. I could 100% see him break out into becoming a productive starter, maybe even approach All Star status. Look at Julius Randle or Kyle Lowry. Some guys are late bloomers. And if Bags does that, he can't be considered a bust even if he's always going to be worse than Luka/Trae/JJJ."

"No I meant I can see why would think so with these:  With Simmons, yes he can‚Äôt shoot but his game is far more expansive than this, if they trade him then Philly will see their strengths in other areas such as defence really fall in the first place, it‚Äôs all dependent on who they trade him for.  Nets big 3 is unstoppable but who knows if they can stay healthy and as always, there are multiple teams in the race and so many factors that play into who wins the whole thing.  Miami I can see winning the first round depending on their match up but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a serious threat even with Kyle Lowry.  Celtics haven‚Äôt made any significant improvements to their team but based on pure talent alone they‚Äôll be lock ins for a playoff spot.  I think it‚Äôs already been mentioned that Ingles is on the trading block so wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at this.  Porzingis hasn‚Äôt really shown anything to make me believe that he‚Äôll have a career year but it‚Äôs all dependent on how Kidd uses him, &amp; the team."
The 2019 ECF game 1 epic duel between Kyle Lowry and Brook Lopez is one of the stranger hype playoff games I‚Äôve ever seen.
No way is Vince Carter better all time for the Raptors than Kyle Lowry
"#Jeremy Lin  Steph Curry, Kyle Lowry, Monte Ellis, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Amar'e Stoudemire, David Lee, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol are the biggest names I could think of. I think I got them all.   I'll go with Curry, Kobe, Kawhi, Melo, Gasol"
"Tbh cap space doesn't really matter if Beal wants to sign with Boston next summer.  They can just facillitate a S&amp;T.  Wizards aren't going to cut off their nose to spite their face.  If they don't help Beal, it's not like he would then re-sign with the Wizards.  They'd probably rather get 2 firsts out of it and let Beal sign with Boston instead of getting nothing and letting Beal sign with someone else (like Spurs) who can clear space.  &amp;#x200B;  Bottom line is they would never get fair value back for Beal if Beal intends to leave.  Look at the Jimmy Butler or even Kyle Lowry deals."
Future hall of famer Kyle Lowry is how
"Some more context here in case you're curious. Our goal is to honour Kyle Lowry as the greatest Raptor of all time.   For the man who‚Äôs been dropping dimes since 2012, we‚Äôre campaigning to get the Royal Canadian Mint to put his face on a commemorative/limited edition Canadian dime.  There's actually a formal process to submit a commemorative coin design to the Canadian Mint - we're going through that right now. The grassroots support with this petition will really help push it forward and show the Mint how important he was to Canadian basketball and our history."
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?  Top (potential) free agents were:         Kawhi (doesn't count; wasn't leaving)   CP3 (old)   John Collins   Kyle Lowry (old)   Mike Conley   Demar DeRozan   Devonte Graham       Other names:   Duncan Robinson   Lonzo Ball   Danny Green"
Kyle Lowry taking a charge in the all-star game
"The East has never been weak at the PG position, what kind of bullshit is this?  Kyle Lowry  Kemba Walker  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Isaiah Thomas  Trae Young  Ben Simmons  These guys have all been All NBA caliber PGs at some point in recent memory despite playing in the east."
"Ingram is better that‚Äôs not controversial and hasn‚Äôt been for the past two seasons imo. Ben Simmons plays in the East which was weak at PG so him and Kyle Lowry made a ton of all star teams. They would‚Äôve never sniffed multiple all star teams in the west. Ingram has improved his game every season and only weakness is his defense which can improve as he adds more muscle but he has the length and agility. Ben Simmons issues are mental and mechanical. Im not sure how a grown man 25+ already in the league with a ton of money fixes that. Or if he even wants to. His situation is a fucking mess honestly. His production is very deceiving because he gets most of his numbers in first half transition opportunities you can literally see him hunting his 7-8 rebounds/assists to have that bs ‚Äúall around‚Äù argument when he disappears in half court offensive sets where he‚Äôs useless or gets benched. If the Sixers had Ingram no way they lose to ATL. They just needed Ben to score like 16 per game and instead he gave them like 9 with a million missed free throws. His defense wasn‚Äôt all that great either so throw that argument out. He couldn‚Äôt guard Trae Young, Huerter, Collins, etc. he was just running around out there."
Kyle Lowry about to have no ass
"Yeah Richmond means current guys like Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal will make it in for sure.  The bar is crazy low. You just gotta be a a 22ish ppg player for a decade and you'll get in."
Add Kyle Lowry to the taking charges list. He also has a HOF booty.
"Theoretically, yeah, but I doubt it. He'd have to have a Kyle Lowry-esque offensive improvement, where he cleans up his shot mechanics and becomes like a 38% shooter‚Äî he has the skill to do some really nice stuff off the dribble, he just can't *sink* those shots well enough for them to be effective offense. That's just a pretty big ask"
"Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt an all star until he was 28, also couldn‚Äôt shoot until he was like 26. It‚Äôs possible but unlikely"
"Absolutely. I feel like a lot of folks haven't made this parallel enough because they are different sizes but there is an outcome for Marcus Smart's career where he really takes a leap like Kyle Lowry did in his age 27-33 seasons. His median 3 pt. % is around 35% over the last three years; the one thing truly barring him from reaching that point is his efficiency at the rim. He simply MISSES bunnies at a much higher rate, maybe it's a touch or athleticism thing but if he can get that part of his game shored up then it's a distinct possibility for him.  This coming year is going to tell us a lot."
You MIGHT want to google what Kyle Lowry looked like when he was Colin Sextons age.
Not unless he suddenly has a Kyle Lowry-esqe mid career improvement
"Clearly, Collin Sexton must be better than Kyle Lowry cause points."
What does this make Kyle Big Booty Lowry?
"To some extent that's true but there will always be players like Chris Paul, Trae young, and Kyle Lowry that are ~6'0"" but with ball skills and basketball IQ that make them more valuable than many players that are larger and more athletic."
Kyle Lowry statue confirmed?
"If he takes another step as a passer and gets better defensively at deflections, he could be the secondary playmaker the Mavs are looking for. Kyle Lowry lite!"

"if the only way the offseason couldve been a success was to give Kyle Lowry 3/100, I'm glad we failed."
Kyle Lowry gets 5 rings with the Raptors and enters the conversation
"What was the best team lebron beat to get to the finals when he was In The East all those years? The Roy Hibbett Paul George Pacers? Jordan beat Ewing and starks, Miller, price and Daugherty, Thomas and dumars, hardaway and O‚ÄôNeal, Barkley (when he was still  in philly), Wilkins, Bird, mchale and parish (old, but still playing).    Lebron beat Kyle Lowry and senator derozan over and over and over.  Oh, and John wall and Bradley Beal.   Who did Jordan beat in the finals? Malone, stockton, Barkley, magic, Payton, and Drexler.    I give lebron credit for beating the Spurs with Duncan, Ginobli, and Parker (popovich is the best coach either Jordan or lebron faced.  So I give him major kudos for beating him), and the warriors with klay, steph and draymond.  But his lost to mavs is inexcusable and cannot be ignored when comparing him with someone who went 6-0 in finals series.  How do you ignore that and his 3-6 record in finals series? Aside from his first run with the cavs against the Spurs where he had no shot to win (I don‚Äôt hold this against him) he played with 2 other hall of famers in all of his other finals series and his record is under 500.  What measure do you want to use to figure this out? Jordan has him beat with everything! Jordan‚Äôs peaks was higher than lebron, it just is.  Lebron has played damn near 50% more games than jordan and thus has amassed an incredible resume. But it‚Äôs just not as good as Jordans"
I guess Kyle Lowry wanted to play with Butler more than Iuka ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
what is kyle lowry? (btw i love kyle lowry)
"‚ÄúJimmy‚Äôs toxic personality‚Äù LMAO that‚Äôs way overblown.. my take is that his leadership is not for everybody, it fits with the Heat and the Heat players in our lockerroom Bam, Dragic, Herro, Duncan.. you think Kyle Lowry came to Miami bc he loves toxic people?  KAT is just not built for it man, he doesn‚Äôt have that edge"

"  Again, that was what the Raptors asked for. I asked you, where did I ever say a team **offered** the Raptors multiple firsts for Lowry.   It would‚Äôve been 2 of Dennis/Trez/KCP + Wesley Matthews. I don‚Äôt recall where either of us mentioned a first being included but the deal didn‚Äôt work out because of THT.   Lowry‚Äôs ask was $25M/year for two years‚Ä¶back in March‚Ä¶.  [Right before the start of FA he requested $30M/year on a multi year deal.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31937408/sources-miami-heat-positioning-become-frontrunners-land-kyle-lowry-sign-trade-toronto-raptors)   There‚Äôs a good amount of ‚Äúraw‚Äù NBA prospects who panned out to be above replacement level. The Raptors have 3 on the roster.   Nunn is a combo guard at best. The bulk of the Heat‚Äôs playmaking revolves around Jimmy/Bam/Dragic. Nunn served as an off-guard."
"&gt;None of my links stated that.  ""Toronto's asking price has been accordingly high: as ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported earlier Thursday, the Raptors have asked for multiple first-round picks and young players, including Philadelphia's Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey, in order to deal their franchise legend to his hometown.""  \-- [https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/)  Furthermore, the original point of the thread was that Lowry was not worth Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, and a first -- which you argued for a couple days.  &gt;Miami isn‚Äôt paying Lowry $5 million more a year if they don‚Äôt have to,  Well, yeah they are, since Lowry's ask was [$25 x 2.](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-eyeing-kyle-lowry-two-year-deal-nba-free-agency)  Even Lowry didn't think he was worth this contract, and it's not as though adding more AARP-eligible years adds value to the team.  In all likelihood, this contract will be among the league's worst by next season -- as we repeatedly see with expensive deals for players in their mid-to-late thirties.  &gt;especially considering how that deal essentially puts them at the salary cap, and especially because \~$5M of TPE rarely amounts to shit. Lowry‚Äôs asking price was always around $30 million a year with a 3rd-year.  Again, you don't pay more for adding years that late in a career.  &gt;I said Toronto was offered KCP/Wes/Trez at the deadline. Dragic/Achiuwa is not a far smaller return, it‚Äôs actually a better return because Dragic is better than KCP and Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.   35 year old Dragic is not better than Caldwell-Pope -- which is why Dragic has not been an NBA starter in four years -- and his play dropped off significantly last year, and his health is unknown.  If they were the same age, that would be true, but Caldwell-Pope is seven years younger.  Dragic also has a worse contract.  &gt;Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.  Achiuwa is an extremely raw 20th pick, which makes him unlikely to be anything but a replacement-level player.  There's obviously a chance he's more, but it's slight.  &gt; It is also better than no return.  If Dragic is healthy and can play.  &gt;They‚Äôve only had 1 true point guard (Dragic) since Jimmy Butler arrived.  Kendrick Nunn is a point guard, and played 30 minutes per game for the Heat in both the preceding two seasons.  They also had Vincent for both of those seasons, and he even played 13 minutes per last year.  So, no."
While I agree what are your thoughts on Kyle Lowry doing the same
bc they added old ass Kyle Lowry and overpaid Duncan Robinson?
19 million for a lesser Kyle Lowry is still a good deal.
"Wait about a year or two, and make the poll on the Raptors subreddit whether they would rather have Kyle Lowry in his prime or *insert best player* and I'm sure Lowry will lose."
I find it hard to believe they ranked Kyle Lowry over Jimmy Butler. Kyle is great but Jimmy was borderline mvp level at times last year.
And Kyle Lowry is better than Jimmy Butler? Wtf?
"Kyle Lowry was 100% more important to that fjnals run than siakam even if pascal played great, especially in the finals."
Kyle Lowry should kiss Kawhi's feet for saving his legacy every single day
"Kyle Lowry was obviously the 2nd option on that team, not Siakam"
Why would the raps do Dallas a favour and buy dragic out? That makes no sense at all. Raps have lots of money lol did people not learn anything from the Kyle Lowry s&amp;t? Masai gives zero fucks about anything other than winning more chips in Toronto. Does buying out dragic help accomplish that in any way? No. So no point writing an article about it. Masai a pretty simple dude if you pay attention
"&gt;Demar was not better than Kyle Lowry that year. The next year sure but not in 15-16. Lowry was basically scoring the same amount while being the primary playmaker and a better defender.  You are correct. I was thinking of the '16-'17 season when DeMar put up 27/5/4 and took them to 3rd in the East.  &gt;Just cause you aren‚Äôt the best guy on your team doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt deserve to be all nba &gt; someone who is alone on a team lol.  When it's Lowry or Klay vs. James Harden no you don't.  &gt;His longevity isn‚Äôt as good then if he gets hurt during the season you are trying to use as a example of his longevity being the same as Bron LOL  Oh so Lebron has never been injured before? Only played 55 games at age 34, must not have longevity."
kyle lowry
Demar was not better than Kyle Lowry that year. The next year sure but not in 15-16. Lowry was basically scoring the same amount while being the primary playmaker and a better defender.

"He absolutely was in the conversation for MVP before his knee injury my dude. He missed the last 22 games of the season and they fell out of playoff contention without him.   Maybe calling Lowry and Klay ""role"" players was a bit harsh but they weren't the best players on their team. DeMar was better than Kyle that year and obviously Steph was better than Klay, that was Steph's unanimous MVP year."
"excuse me? what fantasy world are you living in that serious, non-ironic people were saying that kawhi would leave? Every major publication stated the kyle lowry destination was the biggest free agent this offseason, kawhi was assumed to be returning by almost everyone"
"he gets paid like a leader and thinks of himself like one, though.  And if you dropped the 2016 versions of Damian Lillard, CP3, James Harden, Russ, Kyle Lowry or even someone like current Jamal Murray onto the Cavs they could totally win the championship.  LeBron makes it so much easier for his teammates, all of those guys who have struggled to find tremendous success as first options would be able to shine their brightest next to LeBron."
"Ask a Derozan ""fan"" and they will tell you he is a better player than he has ever been. And they aren't wrong. He just was never all THAT good to begin with. Those Toronto accolades are a mirage. They are a reward for winning that belong as much to Kyle Lowry and Masai Ujuri as him.   Look at the guys on the Raptirs the year he got 2nd team all-NBA.  Derozan  Lowry  Valanciunas   Ibaka  Powell  Wright  Siakam  Poeltl  Vanvleet  Anunoby  That is a legit 10 nba guys who have been or become starters.  That is why they won 59 games instead of Derozan putting up those numbers as a Bull and winning 35."
My brother thinks kyle lowry&gt; cp3
Kyle Lowry
Had to do this    kyle lowry and fvv aren‚Äôt no spot up shooters they aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like they some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick these are fuckin god humans steph curry come again only this time they‚Äôre not fuckin pussies pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Casuals man. I have a hard time believing most of the people downvoting watched Lowry play that season, because saying Kyle was the best PG in the east that season wasn‚Äôt that much of a hot take. Like you said, at the end of the day Lowry will be a HOF and Wall will not."
Posting up Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry 1 championship  John Wall 0 championships
"I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say they imploded. Circumstances dictated the direction they had to go in.  Kawhi left to go home, Danny Green leaves in free agency. And they were still only one possession away from the ECF the very next season.   Next, they lose their center rotation as an ageing Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka move on.  Then you have the covid ridden disaster season, where half the team misses extended periods with covid, along with the senior coaching staff, all while playing the entire season on the road, as the entire franchise is displaced for a year.   If anything, I would look at their situation and say they are on course for one of the quickest turnarounds we‚Äôve seen in a long time. They‚Äôre about two years ahead of schedule in their rebuild, with keeping their young-ish core of Fred-OG-Pascal together while adding Barnes with the fourth pick, along with a few young, good potential, development prospects, and they currently have a roster where not a single player is over the age of 30.  The upcoming season will be all about development for the newer, younger guys, and the growth into full time  leadership roles for the more established core in the absence of the long time leader Kyle Lowry. I would expect them to be a playoff team, at the very least in or around the play in spots."
According to Reddit Kyle Lowry is the best PG of all time. You just have to look at the advanced stats lmao
Man I really need someone in my life that will defend me like Raptors fans defend Kyle Lowry
John Wall 2016-17 playoff stats:  27.2 PTS (45/34/84) 10.3 AST 1.7 STL 1.2 BLK (13 games)  Kyle Lowry 2016-17 playoff stats  15.8 PTS (46/34/81) 5.9 AST 1.5 STL 0.5 BLK (8 games)
I feel like people have already forgotten about C.J. McCollum. Kyle Lowry and Goran Dragic definitely gonna be forgotten.
"I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Orlando finished below 24 wins. A lot of our players are young as hell, and the entire coaching staff has zero experience as a head coach. The Hawks are coming off an ECF appearance, Miami got Kyle Lowry, and the Hornets will probably improve as well. Even the Wizards will probably be decent this year."
Keep Kyle Lowry in
DAE Kyle Lowry fat ass LMAO
Kyle Lowry is a multiple All Star. He is still in my star category.
Okay how is Kyle Lowry not a star?
Kyle Lowry Josh Smith Rudy Gay CJ McCollum Isaiah Thomas Siakam
Tyrese feels like he could be Kyle Lowry or Bradley Beal
This belongs to Kyle big booty Lowry. Only Kyle.
Kyle Lowry
"no ass slaps, no kyle lowry booty.  coincidence?  I think not."
"Kyle Lowry /  Jose Calderon /  Fred VanVleet  Honourable mentions: Damon Stoudamire, Alvin Williams, TJ Ford"
Kyle Lowry
Kyle and Demar will forever be the goat bromance to me. But Lowry and Butler is def shaping up to be the best ‚Äòsame team‚Äô bromance in the league for the foreseeable future.
"People are really stretching these days for big 3's.  Does old man Kyle Lowry count in a big 3 cuz he made all nba 3rd team one time 5 years ago?  I really like Bam, but has he done enough to be a ""big 3"" guy?   If Jimmy butler is the 3rd guy in you big 3 you've got an amazing team. If he's the best guy in your big 3 tho?"
Why do people act like the heat getting a washed Kyle Lowry will make them any better than they were last year lol
Inb4 Kyle Lowry becomes the new ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù of the Miami Heat
"Well said. He would absolutely be getting tons of positive admiration if he was on a rebuilding team in a bigger role.   The Lakers could have traded him for Kyle fucking Lowry. That tells me that they really believe the guy has all star potential (which I do as well) and can be the Lakers point guard going forward after Lebron is gone.   It‚Äôs a tough spot for a young point guard, he‚Äôs best on ball, but he‚Äôs most needed off ball. Hopefully he‚Äôs benefiting from being around Lebron, Rondo, Westbrook and that makes up for the lack of applicable playing time he‚Äôll get.  And maybe in the long run, he‚Äôll benefit from this time and improve his off ball shooting and cutting and defense a lot."
Maxey is better than Kyle Lowry at this point in career
"Wasn't Bam drafted 2017 pick 14th? I could be wrong though. Jimmy butler is getting older and so is Kyle Lowry. Pat Riley don't make mistakes so there's something he saw in herro. You see what harden,lebron,KD,kyrie and others are doing during the summer? They are playing pro am basketball against each other getting better even though they are superstar s."
Replacing Maxey and George Hill's minutes with Kyle Lowry does not make you worse stop it
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
I think if they got Kyle Lowry last year or this off-season it would‚Äôve changed everything for them.
"I don't even know anymore. There are fans like you who want to see him win, but there are others that scream fuck kyle lowry loud and proud just because he left and went to Miami lol"
You made this post just so you could mention Kyle Lowry playing Princess Peach didn‚Äôt you
"They had a super team those last two championships and the bubble year doesn't count! What did they do this  year exactly? Last championship was in 2013. They have bam, butler, and now Kyle Lowry. They need another prolific scorer which would be tyler herro if his progression was where it should be. The dude is good but he could be a 20ppg scorer. His jumpshot is water and his confidence is mamba like. I just want him to do more"
You a heat fan. That's why yall will never win. Good thing yall got Kyle Lowry now. He works!
Dude they didn‚Äôt make the playoffs with AD The jruth (before he got the respect he deserved dude been balling since phili) Eric Gordon Ryan Anderson and Tyreke evans. They aren‚Äôt going to be a contender as stacked as the west is I doubt they‚Äôll even be a playoff team they lost like half their games last year alone in like the final 5 minutes because of general inexperience and lack of vets. They certainly aren‚Äôt a destination and hanged their future in almost 40 year old Kyle Lowry. They need a complete wipe of roster rebranding and ownership/management
Yeah... maybe biased but Kyle Lowry should probably be number 0.
I respectfully disagree. It has to be the Kyle Lowry yeet for me.
A) Chris Paul  B) Mike Conley  C) Kyle Lowry  D) Jrue Holiday
"If only they traded for Kyle Lowry, Sixers just need a main playmaker, Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons and Embiid will make it work easily."
Okay I will.  Kyle Lowry sucks and this sub is the only place where he gets as highly rated as he does.   You say any of those takes anywhere else about Lowry and you‚Äôd get flamed so hard.

Prime Kyle Lowry averages about 17ppg and 7asts when you remove his first few years of development. Its not crazy to say Mitchell could be a Lowry tier player unless youre vastly overrating Lowry like many on this sub do.
"Let me guess:  &gt;!Player A: Chris Paul!&lt;  &gt;!Player B: Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley!&lt;  &gt;!Player C: (I had to google for this one so no submission, got it wrong.)!&lt;  &gt;!Player D: Jrue Holiday!&lt;  &amp;#x200B;  My ranking before knowing who it is:  A, B, D, C  My ranking after knowing who it is:  A, D, C, B"
Guesses:  A: Someone  B: Kyle Lowry  C: Eric Bledsoe  D: Jrue Holiday
Kyle Lowry is better.
"And nobody used that rationale cause it leads to the complete prioritization of 3 and D players. For example, I‚Äôm pretty sure 90% of teams would take brook lopez over valancunis, Capela, Vucevic and co. Would you consider him a better player ? Most teams would take a jrue holiday, Malcolm brogdon or Kyle Lowry over Russ. Are they better players ? Just wanna see how consistent your logic is.  And white is a pretty average 3 point shooter."
"Again you're talking about some of the most talented players of their eras, borderline MVP guys in their prime (except Lowry. Sorry Kyle.) And, Steph, Dame and Nash are 6'3, that's not undersized. They're small players, but they are not small guards."
Never seen anyone overrate a player as much as this sub does Kyle Lowry.  Look at what literally every high end player in the league has said about Jrue and then show me them saying the same thing about Kyle Lowry.
You didn‚Äôt use numbers the year before they joined the Hawks. You said Capela averaged 16 and went to 15and he averaged 13 and increased his scoring with the Hawks. You chose incorrect stats on purpose.   Kemba missed 16 games in the regular season and 0 in the post-season. He was banged up not injured. Otherwise Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry won an NBA championship more injured than Kemba last year.  And again you said they have 7 plus guys that could do that. Where only 4 of his teammates have ever done that with one of them being 34 and out of his prime.   What‚Äôs also funny is that 2 of the players you reference were playing with generational playmakers with Harden and CP3.   And it‚Äôs hilarious that you keep saying ‚Äúppg last year before hawks‚Äù when that isn‚Äôt true.
Kyle Lowry &gt; Jrue Holiday in everything except defense and even in that category he's not far behind. Jrue's height and strength gives him the advantage in that category.
Sixers mightve gotten Kyle Lowry now too
"Tbh I think Kyle and Jrue are similar playmakers. Jrue outplayed CP3 at point in the finals last year (which is a pretty small sample size) and was a huge step up from Bledsoe too.  Offensively, Lowry is probably better but Jrue was still a beast in regular season and he‚Äôs had great playoffs runs before and was good the Hawks and Heat series"
that would be glorious lmao. only for that to slap us in the face and miami wins a rematch against the lakers in the finals and kyle lowry wins fmvp
Do people really think Kyle Lowry is the difference between legitimate championship contender and getting ass blasted in the first round by the Bucks?
"Kyle Lowry, Demar, Kawhi, Siakam, Chris Bosh"
"Morey ""basketball genius/Money-ball savant""ed himself out of Harden and a package including Kyle Lowry. Good luck smart guy"
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
"Yeah the position is deep, which is why he has never been a top 3 pg. I‚Äôm not saying he isn‚Äôt a great player, but you could argue a few of his best seasons he was still behind Kyle Lowry or IT even."
"When the Raptors finally signed khem birch late in the season Kyle Lowry was seen on the court mouthing ""thank you"" to birch after a play. Why a thank you? Because birch (who had just been released mid season by Orlando) could actually catch a pass... Aaron was so bad Lowry was passive aggressively clowning him mid game when he wasn't even playing"
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
"&gt;Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  This was hilarious when it could be argued that a Simmons for Lowry and a middling player is an even trade."
"For guards: Watch Kyle Lowry. Fundamentally sound and know how to get advantages despite his lack of height. Do Not Watch Steph or Kyrie.  For Forwards: Watch Paul George. Very nice shooting form and a tight handle, and has some of the best instincts on defense. Don‚Äôt watch KD or LeBron.  For Bigs: Tim Duncan was always a great example of how to be a traditional bigman. Don‚Äôt Watch Cousins or Jokic."
For a big men al horford. Hes been a simple yet effective and winning player his whole career. He can pop out and hit a 3 or start the offense at the top of the key or in the post. He knows how to move his feet so he rarely gets cooked on switches and is strong enough to handle most guys in the league. I think hes a great guy to look at since hes not an uber athletic/skilled center but still more than gets the job done. For wings id say gordan hayward plays basketball like every coaches dream just a shame hes never healthy. He almost always makes the right play and doesnt have any holes in his game. Shooting guards it has to be klay. A sniper that gets his looks moving off ball and is a pest on defense. And for pgs kyle lowry. Lowry is small and hasnt always been an amazing player but hes gotten better every year and has really made himself to be one of the most effective guards in the league at both ends. For guys a little taller jrue holiday.   Tldr: guys that play both ends and dont force it on offense
"DeMar (4-time consecutive all-star if I recall correctly), Jakob (young promising prospect), and a late first round pick was considered a slight underpay for one year of Kawhi Leonard.  Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  Morey set his asking price too high, and the rest of the NBA moved on without pursuing Simmons."
He needs the blessings of Kyle lowry
"Well we gave the bag to an old Kyle Lowry, we think Jimmy is MJ reincarnated, R Rob over Herro any day but Herro will get more time, and I don‚Äôt really think our roster got better this off season. I love Bam but damn he can‚Äôt do it himself, he‚Äôs not the type to completely take over and dominate every single game."
Blessing? Who the fuck is Goran Dragic compared to Kyle Lowry? Lmfao
"His number isn't retired and more likely than not wouldn't be retired. Dragic asking Lowry for the number 7, if he were to stay in Toronto, is understandable because 7 will be retired for Kyle Lowry one day. Dragic didn't do enough to get his number retired so there's no need to ask."
"You also don‚Äôt have Kyle Lowry, easily the second best player on your championship team, especially in the Finals."
Where were you when Kyle Lowry was traded from the Rockets?
Kyle Lowry? Not really a bust but had a slow start compared to where he ended up
"For the Raptors, Kyle Lowry Game 6 vs the Celtics (2020) and Game 7 vs the Heat (2016), Terrence Ross 51 point game  For my favorite players: LeBron Game 6 vs the Celtics (2012), Devin Booker Game 1 vs the Lakers (2021), James Harden 60 point triple double"
"Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marcus smart? My bias wants to say Kyle Lowry is different but these guys all hype the shit outta teammates and are annoying as hell to anyone who isn't but also they're going back you up or pull you out of any situations  Edit: saw someone say Steven Adams, that's probably the guy"
"I think Kyle Lowry sucks now, he won't be able to stay healthy, and that contract will be a nightmare. There, now one of us will probably be right."
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.   Ben Simmons-JaDeveon Clowney  Blake Griffin--Tony Romo  Chris Paul--Phillip Rivers  Lamar Jackson--Allen Iverson  Ja Morant--Kyler Murray  Jimmy Butler--Richard Sherman  Draymond Green--Donta Hightower  Kevin Garnett--Ed Reed  Rob Gronkowski--Shaq  Kyle Lowry--Steve Smith  Dirk Nowitzki--Antonio Gates
That kid got some kyle lowry mentality in terms of taking the charge
"I think Kyle Lowry will help Bam unlock a new level to his offense, really excited to see their pick and rolls."
"I want to see Kyle Lowry taking three charges in the All Star game. And that's Phat Kyle Lowry to you, emphasis on the ph."
"Derrick is an excellent defender, high IQ and great instincts similar to a Kyle Lowry with the way he draws charges or a Danny green the way he tries to meet guys at the rim, but he‚Äôs athletic and 6‚Äô5 or so.  Offensively he is solid at everything but great at nothing. He‚Äôs a solid passer and can run point but he‚Äôs best when he‚Äôs being used as a score first player. He‚Äôs a solid shooter from mid range and 3 but a bit inconsistent and overall not great. He‚Äôs a very tenacious rim finisher around the rim and great at getting through contact but he‚Äôs a bit of a rhythm player in that way."
Seeing Kyle Lowry in the locker room
Kyle Lowry
"Or Kyle Lowry, taking charges like that"
Kyle Lowry has entered the chat
"Gee, Idk maybe because he averaged 6 points fewer along with one less rebound and assist in the postseason while they got swept. (2017)  In 2016, he actually didn't play too bad against the Cavs, except Kyrie averaged more assists and points while shooting a higher fg% (outplaying him).  In 2018, they got swept by a Cavs team who got taken to seven by the injured Boston Celtics, and the Victor Oladipo led Pacers.  It has been failure after failure for Kyle Lowry against Lebronto."
Kyle lowry
Something something Kyle Lowry.
"I know it‚Äôs easy to shit on the org, and they definitely made mistakes, but it‚Äôs also really hard to build around a #1 pick that‚Äôs an all-NBA player right out of the gate. The Mavs have the same issue with Luka. You only get these kind of guys when you‚Äôre a deep lottery team, then they come in and instantly boost your team out of the lottery. Then suddenly your picks aren‚Äôt as valuable in trades and if you keep them it‚Äôs hard to find impact players in the 20s.   If you‚Äôre not in a FA destination city, what are you supposed to do to build a contender? All-star caliber 2nd options like Khris Middleton or Klay Thompson or Kyle Lowry aren‚Äôt easily available.  The Mavs have a lot of good role players around Luka, and the Cavs did a decent job of getting role players around LeBron too. The problem is finding a true 2nd option"
"Right now its 50/50 fkk or fkl  Fuck Kyle Kuzma Fuck Kyle Lowery  We hate Kyles!   Kuzma is due to an off hand comment he made about being a no one in LA is better than being a star in Orlando, and Lowry is because of a dirty play on Aaron Gordon in the bubble playoffs where Gordon missed most of the rest of the series due to it."
"nobody has ever suggested anyone other than kawhi was ""the guy"" in 2019 lol. This is about after that.   Nobody said he's lying about it, I'm saying he didn't have to be sat down and told he's ""the guy"" now. He was the next leading scorer after kawhi in 2019, he got paid max money that off-season, and he was even playing that role as our #1 guy to start the 19/20 season.   he said kyle was even telling him that he's ""the guy"".   &gt; because him being the primary option was something that happened out of necessity not the result of a plan.  what does that even mean? When we paid him, the plan was for him to be our #1 guy, or at least to be one of the best players on the team along with FVV and lowry.   This isn't even about being the guy, it's just playing his game and improving every year. He doesn't need to be anyone he's not, him playing his game the best he could would be enough. But that isn't something he has always done consistently. He's still learning that part of it, being consistent on a nightly basis."
"I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why Kyle Lowry was telling the crowd to shut the fuck up lol. Like this thread says, the entire Raptors fan base is full of awful people. Canadians trying to take out their little brother anger like Siakam mentions."
"i dont think it has anything to do with lowry..pascal was dominating the beginning of 2020..he just had ebbs and flows with his performance, and kyle isnt some 20 and 10 guy himself"
"It's an issue with confidence. It's hard to be the guy when you have someone like Kyle Lowry, one of the longest tenured Raptors at that point, still making and taking charge."
Kyle Lowry will single handedly skew the data to a non-representative size
I see Kyle Lowry with lighter skin and a slimmer face
"Nash by an absolute mile. Thomas has become so incredibly overrated as people have forgotten the other members of the Bad Boys. He did not carry a team to consecutive titles like Hakeem. IT didn‚Äôt even make All-NBA either year the pistons won (Dumars did in 90). When they actually won he averaged 18 ppg on terrible efficiency and defense. I‚Äôve even seen some people claim he was a great defender because the pistons were a great defense, but Isiah was by far their worst defender.   The Bad Boys had 5 all star level players (Thomas, Dumars, Aguirre, Rodman and Laimbeer) on their title winning teams, with great depth as well. Replace Thomas with somebody like Mark price/Kevin Johnson/Chauncey Billups/Kyle Lowry and they still win in both 89 and 90. Using his titles to put him over somebody like Nash that was a much better passer and a better scorer when you consider efficiency is just dumb. Saying Isiah beat MJ is like saying Tony Parker beat Lebron in 2014."
Things are gonna get messy but I‚Äôve never seen Kyle Lowry get as much praise as he does here than anywhere else like you‚Äôd think dude was a top 3 PG or some shit the way this sub talks about him.
"The list of people who they have ranked as worse prospects than Elfrid is pretty epic. Embiid, Giannis, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gobert, Bradley Beal, it just goes on and on and on, lol."
"Charlotte &gt; Washington &gt; Toronto  Charlotte could only get better despite their losses. If Gordon Hayward stays healthy throughout the season, the team could definitely build some chemistry and be a solid 6-8th seed. A lot of their success would depend on how much better LaMelo would be.   Washington lost a lot of continuity after the Westbrook trade though it would be interesting to see how Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, and Montrezl would fit in with the team. Rui‚Äôs development might be stunted if he competes with Kuzma for pt. It‚Äôs really hard to see them being a solid playoff contender and I don‚Äôt think Bradley Beal will be having a better season. Could compete for a play-in spot if they don‚Äôt have any major setbacks.   A lot of people be sleep on the Raptors after a disorderly season not even being able to have games in their homecourt. That being said, securing the play-in spot seems dim for a team that just lost Kyle Lowry and are looking to shop (I think?) Paskal Siakam. They still do have a lot of good players like OG, and Troy Barnes looks promising. They might surprise people, might not, definitely not a better team on paper than Washington or Charlotte."
"After all the talk from Raptors fans for years about how incredibly valuable and underrated Kyle Lowry is I have to assume they are completely doomed without him, so they are the worst of the 3.  Hornets -&gt; Wizards -&gt; Raptors."
"You just took one point and ignored the rest, eh? Nvm, that point is debatable enough to warrant a reply. Yes, Henry should become a short-yardage back in 3-4 years, but let's think: where did we see in the NBA a player with 3-4 years left on tank that could propel a team for a deep playoff run demanding a trade and getting them? [I wouldn't know] (https://www.nba.com/news/report-kyle-lowry-to-join-miami-heat-for-three-season-in-sign-and-trade).  My point stands. The NBA media wouldn't stand to see a OPOY-caliber player on Nashville, imagine the mere thought of the perennial MVP playing in Missouri instead of California or Miami."
Kyle Lowry $2   Klay Thompson $5   Khris Middleton $5   Anthony Davis $9   Bam Adebayo $6    $27    I use the rest for Hot and spicy from McDonald's
"Kyle Lowry is a great player but the man has had quite a few clunkers. 2/18 in a random regular season OT loss to the Heat in 2019. Ast/to ratio was phenomenal tho lol.  40 min, 12 pts, 2-18 fg, 0-11 3pa, 8-8 ft, 11 ast, 1 to  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201912030TOR.html"
Kyle Lowry for a majority of the season.
"Imagine buying out, 90 fucking million lol. Thats a full kyle lowry"
"Trade him for Kyle Lowry, you could move Lowry to Dallas for picks at the deadline."
Stealth Kyle Lowry thread?
"Real ones know it‚Äôs Derrick White, he has no weaknesses in his game. Reminds me a lot of Kyle Lowry"
You forgot the word hit in your title OP  Steve Nash and Kyle Lowry come to mind as notable late bloomers
"I mean, that's the narrative that's been thrown around after the high-profile LeBron, Harden, KD, etc. moves  But once you look past those few examples, you have Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Giannis, Gobert, Embiid, Marcus Smart, KAT, all guys who have been on their teams for quite a long time and/or have signed long contract extensions that will likely keep them at the same team for several years.  That's just off the top of my head. Tim Duncan and Kobe only retired what, 5 seasons ago? And Nowitzki in 2019.  Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat's roster.  And the NBA has been incredibly cold and cutthroat at times in other eras.  Jerry Krause cut Phil Jackson loose from the Bulls after he won 6 championships. The Bulls also locked Scottie Pippen into an incredibly low-value contract and refused to renegotiate when the salary rules changed the year after his contract was signed.  And players forcing trades happened in other eras too: Dominique Wilkins refused to play in Utah and forced a trade.  Stephon Marbury demanded a trade out of Minnesota when he didn't get along with KG. Kareem demanded a trade to L.A. because he thought Milwaukee was too small of a stage for him.  Ultimately I don't actually think the NBA is fundamentally very different for the vast majority of players.  There have always been top players who used their leverage over teams, and there have always been teams who didn't look out for their players unless it was convenient.  The main difference now is that it's all happening on social media and everyone's *constantly* talking about it."
"Curry is actually a very good defender for his size, so you could say this about any small guard. He‚Äôll throw Kyle Lowry or CP3 into some of those matchups and watch Lebron/ Harden/ Kyrie attack them relentlessly. When you have to choose between Thompson,Iggy,Draymond, KD, and steph then you‚Äôre probably gonna go at steph.   That said, Durant is the much better defender but you could argue Currys offensive impact eclipses him to a degree where it doesn‚Äôt even matter"
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Chris Paul are all better than Kyrie now, and always have been.  Ky isn't good enough to be a number 1 option on a championship team and his game isn't suited to being a number 2 option (He isn't active off-ball, has negative impact defensively and doesn't shoot well off the catch.)"
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Kyle Lowry spot up shooter
Because they never said that. lol. What a fucking stupid conversation. The problem is they mistakenly thought they had a shot at getting Chris Paul or Kyle Lowry. They settled for Graham. They didn‚Äôt pick him over Ball.
Kyle Lowry &amp; Jimmy Butler too.   Butler‚Äôs FT rate dipped from 70 (which is absurd) to 57 to now **39** and his TS is like 55.
"For the vast majority of the Toronto fanbase it would have to be Kyle Lowry.  Many would say Derozan (not me though - to me he's a reminder of teams that were just not good enough and had constant failures in the playoffs).  Personally, it's Jonas Valanciunas."

i think Giddey can be a guy who makes a couple all star games and flirts with a few all-nba teams. i kind of see him as a kyle lowry on the raptors type of player in that he functions as the engine of the team. he knows how to get people shots and makes the right read. this type of impact isn't always really quantified in stats but makes him invaluable to any team.  i hope that kinda makes sense. it's also just my projection/guess as to what's gonna happen lol
"Sigh, I miss the pasta for Kyle Lowry"
Love seeing that Kyle is still putting up the most Kyle Lowry state lines in Miami.
lol Jimmy with the Kyle Lowry pass
Kyle Lowry
Bro I fucking love Kyle Lowry
At this point in their careers Patty Mills &amp; Kyle Lowry provide the same impact on a team.
Kyle Lowry is the master of this so I wouldn't get on too high a horse.
Kyle Lowry had this during our championship run IIRC. Wore one of those big gloves
Youre going to get a lot of ‚Äúkyle lowry is trash‚Äù from box score watchers not realizing his actual impact on the team.
"i agree that deal was always terrible, why give 100+ million to a point who can't shoot he also is a willing passer when he wants to be, he isn't a trae young or kyle lowry whos actively seeking to pass the ball, kick it ahead."
**LOWRY**  THIS DUDE JUST SAID KYLE LOWRY HAS HAD A BETTER CAREER THAN ANTHONY DAVIS HAHAAAAAAA
"Yeah it‚Äôs funny because before the Raptors really took off in popularity back in 2018, Kyle Lowry was widely regarded as a flopper and a dirty player."
"I don‚Äôt really get the argument that draymond wouldn‚Äôt be ultra successful on another team, give him like an average or slightly below average shooter for a starting point guard like Kyle Lowry, he is stlll a monster in the short roll with Lowry, he still is gonna be a awesome setting screens, he‚Äôs gonna be a monster defensively, curry‚Äôs gravity opens up draymonds ability to pass to open cutters in a unique way, but he would still be active finding those guys on other teams."
Kyle Lowry for sure. He's done some sketchy shit.

Kyle Lowry in the finals game 6 energy
davion mitchell got that kyle lowry booty
"I think Lowry was a bit better than Jrue. Jrue was better defensively but his offense was so inconsistent throughout the playoffs I felt he cost his team so games.  Kyle was inconsistent, but his last two series in the ECF and the Finals were really good especially the ECF.  Middleton was a bit  better than Siakam. Middleton was the better scorer and playmaker and also was the team's closer. Siakam was better on defense."
"The bucks, Middleton &gt; lowry, holiday &gt;&gt;&gt; siakam kyle lowry was at the end of his prime and is only better than Middleton at playmaking and I don't think siakam can be a second option but we know jrue can because of his time in New Orleans"
Some other wild things. We traded Jrue away who more likely than not woulda stayed if we woulda been willing to offer him the bag but basically foreseeing that we had somewhat of a mutual separation. But then we go and offer Kyle Lowry more than what it woulda cost for Jrue and we don‚Äôt even get Lowry. I think everybody would say they‚Äôd rather just have Jrue than an older Lowry to go with this core anyway. A similar thing happens where we let Zo go because Griff thinks he would be overpaid but then we offered even more money to Tim Hardaway Jr who may or may not be better than Zo right now but ultimately wouldn‚Äôt really move the needle and has less upside than Zo does. AND again he doesn‚Äôt even come and stays in Dallas for 12 million less. I think both Griff and Pels fans have VASTLY overrated what we would be able to do with extra cap room down here. Nobody of real value will want to come here and even if they do we will have to overpay them anyway just to get them here. So that‚Äôs why when you already have a Jrue or a Zo on your roster you just pay them instead even if you think it might be an ‚Äúoverpay‚Äù. In the NBA if you‚Äôre a good player you‚Äôre gonna get big bucks 9 times outta 10. The only teams who sometimes get away with discounts are the big market teams and we‚Äôre the smallest market in the league
"Kyle Lowry makes every heat player so much better, they look like a good playoff team without him but look like a contender with him."
"&gt; We've never seen Klay lead his own team.  Exactly he has never done it, which is something against him, the same thing happens with someone lile Ginobili. That's not something that helps his case.  &gt; All those stats tell me is the media thought way higher of Pippen than Klay.  Yeah because Pippen was better.  &gt; Klay isn't in the same discussion as a Derozan or a Kyle Lowry or whoever else is getting picked for All-NBA.   IMO he is, maybe you are underrating Lowry.   &gt; The media is just dumb, and using them as your guidelines is embarassing.  Maybe you are just bias with your guy.  &gt; Klay was a huge reason his team went to the finals 5 straight years. Y'all may not understand how incredible he is yet, but once this group is retired you'll realize how good they are.  We understand how huge he was, that doesn't make him a player on the same level as Pippen.  You don't like voting base reasons? How about advanced stats then? Pippen vs Klay:  * Career VORP: 63.2 vs 14.2 * Career WS: 125.1 vs 46.8 * Playoffs VORP: 14.2 vs 3.1 * Playoffs WS: 23.6 vs 8.7  ""But those are cumulative why Klay's career has been shorter"" Let's use minute adjusted advanced stats then:  * Career BPM: 4.1 vs 0.7 * Career WS/48: .146 vs .110 * Career PER: 18.6 vs 16.4 * Playoffs BPM: 4.9 vs 0.7 * Playoffs WS/48: .140 vs .091 * Playoffs PER: 18.4 vs 14.1  Pippen has a higher net rating in the regular season and playoffs."
"We've never seen Klay lead his own team.  All those stats tell me is the media thought way higher of Pippen than Klay. Your stat about Derozan having more All-NBA selections is especially hilarious, that is like the #1 argument that Klay is underrated.  Klay isn't in the same discussion as a Derozan or a Kyle Lowry or whoever else is getting picked for All-NBA. He is WAY better than them. The media is just dumb, and using them as your guidelines is embarassing.  Klay was a huge reason his team went to the finals 5 straight years. Y'all may not understand how incredible he is yet, but once this group is retired you'll realize how good they are."
There's only one Kyle Lowry üòû
"I have a feeling a ""damn the Raptors got Precious for only two good years of Kyle Lowry"" take is going to be a common one in 5-10 years."
"We remember.   We also remember that somebody else was on that team. LeBron something something ... maybe you've heard of him?  If winning one title as the second-best player on the team is enough, then where's Kyle Lowry? Where's Klay Thompson? Where's Manu Ginobilli? Where's Kyrie? Joe Dumars?   The list - aside from halos around the '80s Lakers, '80s Celtics, and '90s Bulls - clearly puts more stock in being the #1 guy on a not-great team than it does in putting the #2 guy on a title winner.   You value what AD did more than, say, Pete Maravich? Totally. But by that metric, AD isn't a particularly egregious snub - there are several players in line ahead of him who have better accomplishments than ONE run as the second-best player on a title team.   The Clyde Drexler comparison is interesting, and gets to the challenge. We know what AD can do as the #1 guy on his team ... and it's not as good as what Clyde did. But if Clyde had been teammates with Jordan, rather than rivals (and that almost happened! Portland brass wanted to draft Jordan and were overruled by the owner, according to the rumors) Clyde would have won multiple titles."
Lakers needed to get a playmaker in a bad way. If there was a way for them to keep KCP and get Kyle Lowry then that would‚Äôve been the better option.    Maybe they should‚Äôve gone after Reggie Jackson. Or Dinwiddie. But I doubt Nets would‚Äôve cooperated with Lakers.  Perhaps they could‚Äôve rolled the dice on Bledsoe. Maybe even Lonzo.
"Kevin Porter Jr., Dwayne Wade, Jordan Clarkson and Kyle Lowry"
"And y‚Äôall were playing the sexist man in Basketball, Kyle Lowry.   It‚Äôs tough not to lose by 40 when he‚Äôs out on the court, just flaunting his ass around like he owns the place. You can‚Äôt realistically expect the opposing teams to keep their eyes and heads on basketball when he‚Äôs got an ass like that."
"This isn‚Äôt a Kyle Lowry situation. Rondo shouldn‚Äôt be shoving his fingers in that dudes face. Even if he was heckling Rondo can use his words and get the fan taken care of, we‚Äôre all humans and doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs an NBA player don‚Äôt go shoving your hands in someone‚Äôs face."
The issue is lebron wants this cause he wants to be able to rest which I get. But I do not understand why in the world he chose Westbrook to be the pg to run the offense so he could get that rest. Kyle Lowry was available for nearly nothing and no move by the lakers‚Ä¶
"Heat is scary this year, it is very exciting.  Glad the Kyle Lowry ankle scare wasn't too serious."
I‚Äôve got Ginobli and Parker over Klay Thompson.  Klay is great but those two guys were in a dynasty that lasted decades.  TBH Klays dynasty lasted as long as a KD contract.  But if he feels otherwise he still has some years to prove it.  Otherwise Klay has as much claim as Chris Middleton or Kyle Lowry.
Masai got something out of Lowry when Kyle was leaving regardless.
"Scottie Barnes is just fun to watch, and I'm ready to fill the Kyle Lowry booty shaped hole in my heart with his highlights."
"You're right but if we're being honest, Lowry doesn't get looked at in a certain way because he played in Canada. Let's really be real.  Like, this should be a no-brainer. Kyle Lowry was the best player and leader of good teams but his name doesn't command that respect."
"Maybe that's true for someone like Ayton, or Scottie Pippen, or Kyle Lowry, or Ginobili... But it definitely isn't the case for Kyrie. He's very much being celebrated for his volume stats in the playoffs during a run where his team was a perennial contender and won a chip. He didn't sacrifice shit lmao."
Only thing Kyle Lowry has over Klay is that thicc juicy ass.
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"That's a poor excuse for his lack of skill development.   Shaun Livingston had skinny legs too, but he could still post up. He couldn't back guys under the rim like Shaq, but he wasn't embarrassing himself like KP. You give Livingston a defender in the post that's 7"" shorter than him and not named Kyle Lowry, that's BBQ chicken.   [11 minutes of Shaun Livingston hitting turnaround jumpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPvJE7e51ug)  KD also has skinny legs, and can't back anyone down either. Here's 11 minutes of him scoring on post ups.   [Kevin Durant Post Scoring '18/19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-OR0w8gnWU)"
"Generally agree; admittedly to say he is ""peak"" for his build of course is hyperbole, but I hoped the message coming across would have been -- he's as good as anyone else with his general build. And that being said, I don't think the players you made for comparison are analogous. Like I said, they're known for specific physical traits that Curry never had, doesn't have, and probably never will have.  For the analogous examples you might have been interested in seeing, well it's guys like:  - Kyrie - Dame - Tony Parker - Steve Nash - Monta Ellis  These are people with similar builds in recent memory whose tenure in the league was based on everything but defense. This doesn't get into all the players that are out of the league or didn't make it. I believe it is fair to say that no one would compare Kyle Lowry or Fred Vanvleed in physical build / athleticism to any of these guys, including Curry.  You can imagine why I didn't just sit here and list them out because that sounds more cherry-picking than anything else.  And overall, I think we're guilty of the same thing. Yeah I don't have any data to show how weak Curry is. I don't have data to show how incomparable his build is to Lowry or FVV. Ultimately it comes down to the eye test -- and I would never group those 3 players together as having the same or similar builds. I use height-weight-wingspan-vertical as a proxy because that information is accessible. Likewise, I suspect you used general size / wingspan as well to source that list (otherwise it would perplex me as to why Thicc Boi Lowry was even brought up).  The one guy that I think fits as a valid counterexample is John Stockton, whose height, weight general strength / push-around-ness on the court mirrors Curry's, yet he made multiple all-defensive teams. He's the only guy I can think of, and even on reviewing a list of similar-sized guards with those parameters above, he's the only guy that stands out. Everyone else was a freak athlete in some other way."
"I agree on Kyle Lowry being a great fit, but;  &gt; Lack of Floor General  Wasn't this kind of Jimmy's role, or am I misunderstanding?"
Have fun with a washed up Kyle Lowry
My criticism isn‚Äôt of Kyle Lowry. The responses in this thread to my comments are ones that are reasonable and I agree with them. My point is that some players don‚Äôt get the benefit of the doubt after one game because people love to overreact. Lowry is one of the lucky ones where people don‚Äôt really have hot takes about him game to game.
I mean is your entire criticism of the Kyle Lowry signing that he had one bad game?
"If you think Kyle Lowry played good last night then you should be happy if he plays that way every other game of the year. Unless of course, his game last night was disappointing"

Kyle Lowry has the best friends in the league.  Change my mind.
"the one thing I will give Dame which Dwight doesn't get discounted for..Dame has been playing in a guard heavy era. During Dame's career he's had to compete with Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall (when he was good), Isaiah Thomas (when he was good), Chris Paul, Kyrie, Kyle Lowry, I mean this era has been one of the most stacked guard eras in a while.   Meanwhile Dwight was making first team as a Center in an era where Shaq in PHX was 3rd team, Andrew Bogut who never made an All Star game is 3rd team, Tyson Chandler who's never made an All Star team was 3rd team. Usually the second best Center was Amare Stoudemire who's more of a Power Forward really, so yeah Dwight was making first team as literally the only TRULY dominant center during his era. Dame is out here missing First Team All NBA because he's behind Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, aka guys that are all on the top 75. Dwight Howard never had to beat a top 75 guy to make All NBA. Dame could very well get 1st team the next 3-4 years now that CP3 has cooled off, Westbrook has cooled off, Curry is still hot but maybe Dame has as good of year."
I've seen enough KP post ups on Kyle Lowry to know where this is going

I think we both know regular season doesn‚Äôt matter per say. Any doubting the Heat this year don‚Äôt know the caliber of player Kyle Lowry is. Playoffs should be fun in the East this year(fun for teams not involved)

"why's this Milwaukee bucks broadcaster calling him Kyle ""Laurie""?  It's Lowry..."
"A few reasons, but We basically had to bet everything on KP and We have had no tradable draft assets because of it. We traded multiple first round picks for KP after trading a first round pick for Luka. Ironically if there was no lottery system we would‚Äôve had the 3rd pick originally and wouldn‚Äôt have needed to trade up. This meant we didn‚Äôt have any 1st round picks that we could trade for 5 years (I think?) because of the Stephan rule. It‚Äôs really tough to trade for good players without first round picks, especially when all the players you draft are projects (josh green, Tyler hey, etc.) so they aren‚Äôt worth much anyways.  In addition, a few years ago we thought we were getting Kemba, but when that fell through our backup plan was seth curry (awesome player), and Delon Wright. Analytics said Wright would be great for Luka (efficient player, good at defense) but he was awful next to Luka (hesitant to shoot, mediocre at best defensively) so that was a bust.  The following offseason, instead of spending our money for guys like bogonovich we were somewhat held hostage by the idea that Giannis might not re-sign with the bucks. Props to the hawks for bowing out of those sweepstakes early and instead shoring up their roster, seems like that was the right move. Because we wanted cap space, we traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson (1yr deal +1 yr player option). We expected him to be the exact player we were hoping to get from Delon Wright, and that he would play above his contract, thus leading him to opt out of Giannis were to be available. Unfortunately he became Delon Wright 2.0 (hesitant to shoot, mediocre defensively), and Giannis re-signed with the bucks later in that offseason. We also traded for James Johnson (expiring) and then traded him for JJ Redick (expiring).  This off-season we had a decent amount of money so we were hoping for Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately he took his talents to south beach. We seem to finally understand our best option is to just spend our money on good role players instead of swinging for big players, which led to re-signing THJ, and signing Bullock and Brown. I think our roster is better than last year, but the coaching change will likely take some time to adjust for the players.  tldr;  Trading for KP and Luka cost us tons of draft capital  We prioritized cap space for star players, but never signed any star players."
The bucks have one of the greatest players to ever play the game in giannis. The two time MVP aint losing to Heat just cuz they got Kyle Lowry now

"&gt;And it begs the question, if you guys were that good last year why wouldn't you have gone all in at the deadline?  What does that mean exactly? Just trading for Kyle Lowry? The team made a few moves at the deadline, not going all-in necessarily, but going into the playoffs I think we were seen as a title contender. I see our odds at [\+800](https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/news/nba/updated-2021-championship-odds-all-16-playoff-teams/), same as the Bucks who actually won the championship  &gt;I don't think Morey feels the same way as your fans for that reason. His actions betray what he actually thinks of the team, no reason to hold onto bench pieces if a difference maker is on the market... unless he thinks you're more than one piece away.  I'm pretty sure he said specifically that the price on Kyle Lowry was ""in la la land"". While in the past he's said if you have a 5% chance you need to go all-in, I'm gonna trust his decision-making on this one. Simmons didn't play nearly as well as I thought he could anyway, so it's probably a moot point. Having Lowry for whatever he would've cost doesn't make the difference last year."
Its simple facts.. Kyle Lowry owns the bucks
Kyle Lowry made that travel call for the refs
"&gt;Tbf Morey thought George Hill was an adequate substitute for Kyle Lowry last season. &gt;  That's a false equivalence. Kyle Lowry wasn't free. Toronto wanted assets in return, and Morey didn't want to give those up."
"I think Colangelo sucked mostly, but  his big swing and miss was Fultz.  And, I just want to remind everyone that Sixers fans, including me, were on here being preemptively mad that he would max Kyle Lowry, which it turns wouldve have been amazing."
9 seasons of Kyle Lowry and motherfuckers still don't understand the value of leadership and chemistry. FOH
"MIAMI ‚Äî For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry‚Äôs face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      ‚ÄúI knew I was good,‚Äù Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. ‚ÄúI knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.‚Äù      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee‚Äôs tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      ‚ÄúWe all were mutually agreed that it was time,‚Äù Lowry said of leaving Toronto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      His journey in Toronto started with questions ‚Äî he was the team‚Äôs backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash ‚Äî crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      ‚ÄúThe city of Tampa was great,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúIt was just difficult because we didn‚Äôt know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.‚Äù      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team‚Äôs dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team‚Äôs president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      ‚ÄúSometimes franchises have to do what‚Äôs best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn‚Äôt say power ‚Äî but I had a little bit of, ‚ÄòListen, it‚Äôs not going to be a good look if we don‚Äôt collaborate on this together,‚Äô‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúWe all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      ‚ÄúWith DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.‚Äù      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,‚Äù Ujiri said at a news conference in August. ‚ÄúWe knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.‚Äù      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been super athletic,‚Äù Lowry said with a laugh. ‚ÄúI can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I‚Äôm not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don‚Äôt need to be jumping.‚Äù      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry‚Äôs sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry‚Äôs primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan ‚Äî ‚ÄúSmooth,‚Äù Lowry said of DeRozan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù      And of Leonard: ‚ÄúA machine,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúHe gets it done.‚Äù      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game‚Äôs quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      ‚ÄúI partly think it‚Äôs to get him going, because he‚Äôs got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,‚Äù Lowry said, adding that ‚Äúsome people can‚Äôt take it‚Äù and think Butler‚Äôs a jerk.      ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs just how he is,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúEverybody has different demands on themselves.‚Äù      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible. It‚Äôs a blessing, and sometimes it‚Äôs a curse because you‚Äôve got to be in some really great shape if you‚Äôre out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.‚Äù      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      ‚ÄúFreddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I‚Äôm the guy who was like, ‚ÄòYo, it‚Äôs on me,‚Äô‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúThey have to take the criticism, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.‚Äù"
Tell me when did I say Cade has the higher potential by far compared to Scottie and how it was implied that I measured a player's potential by their position on draft night. And then tell me which Detroit's game you watched  in order for you to compare Cade to Kyle fucking Lowry..

KYLE FUCKIN LOWRY
"he usually tinkers with rotations early in the season. it works when you have kyle lowry and kawhi leonard to carry you anyway regardless of the other 3 players, but this year is not it lol"
"Probably is only probable, doesn‚Äôt mean it would happen. Joel Embiid at Center, Jimmy Butler that mercy swept MIL, Tobias Harris, JJ Spot up shooter Reddick, and Ben Simmons is different than Kyle Lowry, FVV, DG, Pascal, Kawhi, and Gasol. Different teams, different play styles. Sixers were stacked but Kawhi was better. Let‚Äôs bot forget the Bucks were perennial chokers until the Nets, Hawks, Lakers/Clippers/Warriors injuries"
"If the Sixers kept Jimmy, chances are Kyle would've gone there too. Can you imagine what having a Kyle Lowry could've done for Embiid?"
"i mean KP has been more willing to play inside the last stretch of games but look what happened last night, he goes limping off 3 minutes into the 2nd half.     he clearly doesn't look comfortable there and is justifiably worried about reinjuring his lower body.   and he doesn't have the best core strength you can jam him up on screens and walk around him.  I'm glad he got the memo that he's 7'4 and needs to get more rebounds though I'm still not sold on him boxing anyone out, against the heat he was getting boxed out by kyle lowry of all people lol.   respect to kyle lowry of course he's quite thicc but come on KP you are a foot taller than him letting yourself get muscled around by this guy  I'll give ya kleber would be a nice bench piece on some teams, I like his game a lot.    maybe bullock is good but he seems like he's been public enemy #1 among mavs fans for the last week, if he's not scoring points then he's probably contributing to losing basketball  I thought powell looked alright guarding small forwards but he just gets carved up trying to play center.  I was trying to be generous to him I don't think he would be in most teams' rotations"

They were tied IMO. Kyle was averaging 22 and 7 with elite defence. Demar may have performed better in the regular season but Lowry was better in the playoffs for sure.
"You are truly comparing a generational talent with fairly talented midgets? And look how many upvotes, reddit never fails to make me laugh. And another halfwit cited Curry, lol! As for Kyle Lowry, he is a rare example of a midget who can actually defend and not be a complete liability, but most of them gets exposed, no reason to deny reality"
"nobody ever talks about the suns, thats why they always post that copypasta about their winning streak  his defensive rating was 114 last year this year it's 107  theres like 10 guards with better defensive ratings than booker who have played 300 or more minutes but none of them have similar offensive workloads except donovan mitchell and maybe kyle lowry  also ayton was out for a big stretch of the early season"
I NEED a show of Giannis and Kyle Lowry puttin' on a leadership seminar about buildin' up their teammates. We don't deserve either of them: https://streamable.com/cull4p
"Good on Mark Bartelstein for at least giving Denver fans a glimmer of hope here. He really could have said ""fuck y'all we swindled y'all"". Between this contract and Kyle ""Won't Take a Cent Less Than His Value"" Lowry, this agent must be loaded"
Kyle Lowry a straight chump
"Well, for starters, FVV is scoring roughly similar to what Kyle was his first all star appearance, and he's been improving on his playmaking as well.  Let's not forget a lot of his play is taken directly from what he's learned from Lowry, and now that Lowry is gone he will be filling that role.  It's not ridiculous to expect FVV is able to fill in those shoes"
"Kyle Lowry was an exception, not the rule."
*Kyle Lowry* LOL
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
I‚Äôd kill to have Kyle Lowry on the bulls rn
"Being a fan and being a coach is different. You don‚Äôt see everything as a fan. I‚Äôm not pertaining to your iq with the example im about to make but moreso your or better yet OUR naivety when it comes to assessing rotation and minutes. Remember when fans wanted lin to play cos lowry and vanvleet were slumping hard during the start of the playoffs 3 years ago? Coach knew lin was unplayable but ‚Äúwhat could go wrong‚Äù considering kyle and fred were playing like shit? Well we can consider the possibility that coaches don‚Äôt want to play players that are not supposed to play that type of minutes. Maybe they sucked at practice, maybe they suck at defensive rotations, following their offensive schemes‚Ä¶. Just because you‚Äôre talented doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get minutes. It sets a bad example for the team when u play a ‚Äúscrub‚Äù even when they don‚Äôt deserve it. There are times when coaches play their bench players more but they have to earn it. Borrego is not a dumb coach. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done a heck of a job and is making this team overachieve and build something good. Warriors fans need this type of patience with Wiseman as well (they were amazing when they started benching him last year). He‚Äôs very raw and will be having a hard time staying on the floor when he comes back. Hope the kid figures it out."
In Kobes era guards like T Mac and Marbury dribbled the air out of the ball for 20 seconds before 3 pump fakes and taking a fade away. In which on ball defense was way more important for all players really.   I'm not sure how you think off ball defense for guards is more valuable than on ball. Even for the best guards today. What type of sets or plays are happening where you think a player is making great off ball defense on the perimeter? It's just straight up not as important for guards as it is for forwards and centers. Who need to rotate to close off the paint and prevent layups.  Only example that comes to mind is Kyle Lowry taking charges in the paint. But it's not like Steph or any other guard is really elite at that. Maybe Manu as well.  But Kobes defense was outstanding. If anything it's underrated by the 14 year olds on here who were still in diapers when he was 1st team all D.   Prime Kobe was as good as Jrue Holiday or any of the top guard defenders today.
The fight for kyle lowry will be how the ECF is dubbed this year
Kyle Lowry and tj McConnell
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here with me, Kyle Lowry. Here at the end of all rings‚Äù   -DeMar DeBaggins"
"&gt; Kyle skipped summer school, didn't want to attend college - it was 2004 he was supposed to be doing freshman orientation but was in semi final street game, and in the first summer he was already on his last straw. Kyle just ignored him. Kyle tore his ACL in that game at the same time he was supposed to be at the orientation. Jay had said, that's it and was gonna ditch him, no one could find Kyle. When Kyle tore his ACL, he said he knew it was time to stop being a hard head. Kyle came up on crutches and just went from wanting to turf him to feeling sorry for him.  Kyle had a terrible attitude and almost completely ruined his career before it even started by tearing his ACL in a street game instead of being at orientation. Jay Wright wanted to cut him off of Villinuava. This didn‚Äôt stop in college either, he regularly got into it with the Memphis coaches over not playing more minutes and was shipped out. Curry took over the headlines in Davidson, even LeBron came to watch him play, completely different scenario and ACL injuries at the time were the boogie man injuries that shook people when they heard their fav player tore their acl. There‚Äôs a reason Kyle went 24th and Curry went 7th, the Curry hype was very real and Lowry was seen as a problematic player."
"Kyle Lowry was a 4-5 star prospect (depending which site you use) who was highly recruited to a big name school. Curry, outside of the last name was a relative nobody who didn‚Äôt get any offers but to go to a place most people had never heard of. And it‚Äôs not like curry Didn‚Äôt have potential career altering/ending injuries."
"To be the leader in most charges taken for a couple years. That ball iq pretty high to set your feet right.   Curry is a phenomenal shooter and off ball  defender.  I got to give it to Kyle Lowry. He came in the league unknown journey man and carve something with a legacy in the north.   He's barely 6'0, but made it work"
Bosh was a better player than derozan but had Jarrett jack as his best point guard instead of Kyle Lowry.
Is it him and Vince or him and Kyle? I know the former was absolutely a beast while in Toronto (until he played like shit to get out) but Lowry has a lot of sentimental value that could vault him into the top 2.
"Just because he wasn't playing at the level of superstar players doesn't mean he wasn't good. He listed #1 options, and are comparing them to Lowry.    15/3/6, and 17/4/9 are good numbers, especially considering Kyle does a lot of shit that isn't picked up in stats. Also , Thomas only has one playoffs shooting above 40%, and is a massive negative on defense. Idk how you're using him as an example of a playoff performer. Ppg is not a good judging metric for a pass first pg"
Curry: 85%  Klay: 15%  &amp;#x200B;  KD: 70%  Westbrook: 30%  &amp;#x200B;  Chris Paul: 60%  Devin Booker: 40%  &amp;#x200B;  Kawhi Leonard: 70%  Kyle Lowry: 30%  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron: 80%  Kyrie: 20%
"If anybody knows players that aren't fun to watch, it's Raptors fan. Rest in Peace Kyle Lowry"
The Heat really shouldn't have won this given the circumstances but Gabe Vincent and and Kyle Lowry said NAH
Lol lowry drawing a charge on a half court heave. Love you Kyle!
Bruv lmao the bullshit of mental juggernaut and contortion you‚Äôre going thru for the sake of this argument.   Would you dare to say Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt the 2nd most important player in the Raptors championship run?
"Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt even the second best Raptor in that series. He arguably wasn‚Äôt even their third   Yeah, he finally managed to shake off the trash bro label when he had a really strong supporting cast around him‚Ä¶which Demar never had in San Antonio"
"Lowry shook off the trash bro label long time ago. Didn‚Äôt you watch what he did to your team in Game 6 or 2019?  Even on those early Raptors team with DeMar, Kyle Lowry was their rock, he was as solid as it gets and produce way more consistently than DeMar"
"Not only are they undersized, they're bad at defense.  FVV, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry are all undersized and are still excellent defenders."
"You brought up Kawhi and that's another way they are delusional  Some of them unironically act like they didn't need Kawhi to win and ""first ballot"" Kyle Lowry would have been good enough"
"Campazzo on the nuggets probably not at stocky, and kyle lowry on the heat but he‚Äôs not as short"
"I mean your rant isn't wrong, but r/nba like many subreddits isn't really good for discussions lol.  It's like 90% Memes, 5% Statline wars, 4% dumbass questions/hypotheticals and like 1% actual discussion.  Theres a reason why   ""Is there anyone thiccer than Kyle Lowry?"" Has more engagement than ""Which players can run the Princeton offense the best?""   And thats fine that's what r/nba is bro lol."
"Kyle Lowry was basically like  ""I still love you, you're my true love but I need to go spread my wild seeds while I still can...I'll be back in a few seasons baby ""       I wouldn't be surprised at all if Lowry ended re signing on the cheap with the Toronto and coming off the bench at like 38 years old...by then they will be a monster and ready to win another chip so the timelines would work...plus the still city love the guy!"
"He just doesn't do that often. Not only that but he misses his shots habitually (in the past). Right now he's playing like a young Kyle Lowry and making everything he shoots, so we love him! Before this year he was playing like a talentless Dragic - if that's clear."
"Kyle lowry the king of intangibles, and a charge god."
Kyle Lowry &amp; Toronto Raptors 100%. So good Lowry wants to come back. He also recently released a statement about it all talking about it very well
Kyle Lowry ... We love you bby
Kyle Lowry is a legend here in Toronto. His number will be retired and will probably have a statue along Legends Row when he‚Äôs done
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry
"Playmaking is very heavy ceiling raiser and a good versatile defender raises it even more.  There‚Äôs a reason why advanced metrics indicate he has a solid case for top 10-20 player in the league right now.  Melo is currently league wide. 4th in RAPTOR  12th BPM 9th VORP 14th EPM  We‚Äôve seen players like Draymond with no offensive skills but adds so much to overall team offense by mere playmaking. Even this year where some players like Marcus Smart or  Kyle Lowry who can‚Äôt hit a shot to save their lives are impacting so much of their team offense.  Scoring is so overrated in today‚Äôs league, especially since many of the archetype of scorers are pretty awful on the defensive end. That being said, it‚Äôs good that Ant has shown to be a pretty decent defender with his athleticism."
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry moving to Miami.
Someone said Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt a star is Patty Mills?
Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt change the heat that much. They‚Äôre still gonna be a 4-7 seed who probs lose in the first round
"Kyle Lowry is not a star rn. He‚Äôs a very solid starter as of right now, and this isn‚Äôt me shitting on him the guy is 35 years old."
Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry easily
"By the time that player leaves the team there's a big chance they're not letting anyone use that number anymore. No one has wore #6 for the Heat since LeBron left, same goes for Kyle Lowry and other franchise players.  There are going to be exceptions though, like with Kyrie, whose #2 in Cleveland is being worn by Sexton, or Melo, wearing #15 (which Jokic is wearing now). But what's from stopping them from retiring the same numbers twice, anyway?"
"You should check out the Heat subreddit, that picture was all over it. With Heat fans talking about how Jokic wanted no part of Kyle Lowry looking terrified and the entire rest of the Heat team being successfully held back by one middle-aged dude.  Your entire team is made up of baby-back bitches. HoLd Me bAcK BrO"
It's fucked up that Raptors fans keep downvoting me when I say how Bobby Portis is a better defender than Kyle Lowry.
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Maybe im light headed after beating off after reading all the fanfic porn in the comments.     But I have a feeling that Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry are gonna want smoke after these comments. Those dudes dont play.
"Looking back, it's crazy how many points A.I. scored. By all accounts, dude was averaged sized and wasn't a little tank either to the effect of somebody like Nate Robinson or Kyle Lowry. You won't walk into LA Fitness and see too many guys built like KD or LeBron. You can probably find a dozen guys who are around A.I.'s height and weight. The fact somebody like that played on the biggest stage and was a transcendent scorer at one point is phenomenal."
"To your point, I was at a game the other day and someone in 2nd row was heckling Kyle Lowry (dunno what was said). Lowry looks directly at him and says ""shut the fuck up bitch ass mother fucker"" then the guy gets this incredulous look on his face like he got Lowry. When the ref next to Lowry did nothing the fan said some more shit and Lowry started pointing to the court and said ""come make me bitch.""  These dudes hear so much trash talk, but don't usually have people removed so I have to assume it was a pretty unpleasant thing said to LeBron."
Being a Kyle Lowry fan for years has really conditioned me to appreciate the fearless block more than the fearless dunk.  Am I the only one here thinking that way?
Pacers fans are ass anyway. Kyle Lowry dealt with the same shit.
The worst part about Kyle Lowry fouling out is I had to watch him piss and moan to the refs about the 6 times he obviously fouled someone instead of the normal 3 or 4.
Kyle ‚Äúbeyond the box score‚Äù Lowry with another awesome performance tonight.
‚Äúand it‚Äôs not even close‚Äù this year for sure lol  but watch heat mafia vote in kyle lowry or some shit
"Kyle Lowry never had a right call whistled against him, according to Kyle Lowry."
"Heat fans are learning this year that no matter what he does, Kyle Lowry will never be appreciated by the nephews."
HMMMMM I WONDER WHY ALL OF THOSE SUDDENLY HAPPENED AFTER THE ADDITION OF KYLE LOWRY?????
"Yeah if Smart could be a slightly better scorer, he's not far off from being in that Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry tier of point guard. I like that he's focusing more on 2-point scoring, I like his mid-range game in the post and he's a good decision maker if he draws 2."
"hes been our kyle lowry. This shit happens every year. The whole regular season, people that dont watch the C's shit on smart and say they need to trade him... Then comes playoffs and everyone seems to change strides"
They also just did this with Lowry. They had to dump Dragic and Achiuwa in order to have cap space for Kyle
Mark my words Marcus Smart will become our Kyle Lowry
"That's fair, I do agree that traditionally 25 seems to be about the average to be starting your prime but lately it feels like there's more late bloomers that don't seem like they're fully finished products by 25.  For the more traditional superstars that were hyped in their early college days and given the keys to the franchise in their rookie season, it does seem like 25 is the sweet spot. Looking at players like AD, CP3, Wade, and DRose.  I don't have the stats to back this up but lately it feels like there is another class of player that bloom later and keep pushing their prime so they peak around 28-31. Players like Paul George, Kawhi, Jokic, Giannis, Embiid, Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry and Steph somehow manage to find new tricks and evolve their game. Paul George is playing the best basketball of his life right now at age 31, he is a much better shooter and defender at 31 than he was at 25. While Embiid is pushing further and further up the MVP ladder at 27 building on his defense, I suspect that we haven't seen the best version of Embiid yet.  Giannis has improved his FT and shooting over the past couple of years and I think he also has a little bit more to give. I can see Giannis at age 29 being a better player than he is today given his improvements year-over-year and the gut feeling that he fits into the more late-bloomer mold."
"So to sum it up, fuck Kyle Lowry?"
Actually he's better than Kyle Lowry
"I was listening a one podcast where the person was arguing vehemently why THT is so much better than Kyle Lowry (who could have been gotten in a trade), and knew from then on, to disregard any of their basketball opinions."
Lakers wanted to keep him instead of trading for Kyle Lowry
Should have done gone through with the trade deal with Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry

"The odd calendar of the covid season really screws with my sense of recall, sorry.  What I recalled was that Schroeder could have been offered that as [early as Feb.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-dennis-schroder-declined-the-lakers-contract-extension-offer-and-when-he-can-get-a-fair-deal/). But the news was only broken in March.  Still you may be right that the offer was about the same time, or likely before the trade deadline/lowry rumor.  [At the time,](https://lakeshowlife.com/2021/05/12/los-angeles-lakers-right-not-trade-kyle-lowry/) , Schroeder had not yet laid that egg in the playoffs or revealed his demand for 100-120 mn.  Critically the Lakers[ still had hopes](https://lakeshowlife.com/2021/05/12/los-angeles-lakers-right-not-trade-kyle-lowry/) for the season/postseason and the loss of wing depth and bench was a critical factor.  The offseason decision to lose all that depth to chase WB was in a slightly different context than the trade deadline. it doesn't mean the decision to trade for WB was good, or that there was foreknowledge at the time of trade deadline ..."
I hate Kyle Lowry. He has been a bum in the playoffs his entire career and lucked out by getting Kawhi to carry him to a ring
"Lowry 100% ok maybe more like 90%) would have played if he was on a contending team. We sucked and were tanking, held out lots of guys and Kyle played a few games every now and then.I kept more wear and tear and the team wasn‚Äôt going to stretch it since we sucked"
"Hahaha that‚Äôs Reddit for ya. You disagree and downvotes come, or you post something that isn‚Äôt flavour of the week and they come as well.   I just don‚Äôt think Lowry changes what the Lakers have produced so far. Everything about Kyle helps us for sure (defense, shooting and pace). Westbrook doesn‚Äôt really offer shooting or the defense Kyle has. Westbrook adds lots of stuff people are missing though. Like his ability to create off the dribble, be an elite scorer and I think most importantly his work ethic. Lakers are a victim of not showing work ethic, and Westbrook is giving you 110% in the layup line. It‚Äôll work out I think (but a championship is another question)."
Wonder how Kyle Lowry is doingü§î
"The Heat‚Äôs problem has been Kyle Lowry and Duncan Robinson shooting like ass.   The Jimmy narrative some Heat fans are telling us a weird one, as almost every Jimmy possession either ends in a good look for himself or for a teammate, and often that teammate is Tyler. His shot wasn‚Äôt falling tonight, but he‚Äôs been a top 5 player this year and there‚Äôs an argument to take the ball out of his hands.   Tyler is playing really well in his role, and sometimes the offense doesn‚Äôt find him, but on these plays it‚Äôs mostly been going to wide open shots for guys on the team or good looks for Bam or Jimmy, who can score while being defended. The problem in the first quarter of the season has just been Lowry and Robinson being ice cold.  The Heat can‚Äôt change what they‚Äôre doing. In the end, if they‚Äôre going to be a championship team, they need the role players like Lowry and Robinson to be able to hit shots."
"yeah but surely you understand that jimmy butler, kyle lowry and bam adebayo going cold isn't the norm ‚Äî jimmy's like 2nd in PER this year, lowry's finding a rhythm and bam's dealing with an injury, we looked better with him tonight cause they were all cold"
"They could've had Kyle Lowry, but they wanted to keep him..."
"Posts like these often incite ‚Äúhype comments‚Äù from The fanbase. This is true with any other post about a team/player. There‚Äôs a comment here saying that there‚Äôs a lot of insecurity from other fans but In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite. If there‚Äôs a post about kyle lowry the raptors fans will almost always defend and overrate him (i love him btw just making an example) even though the comments are mild, respectful, and engaging. You have said nothing offensive and yet been downvoted bec the rest of the pop in this post expects you to jerk off Klay. For reasonable fans, we all want klay to succeed lol but will he be playing optimal ball this year? I doubt, but i hope he does, esp come playoff time."
Better than Kyle Lowry right
I mean yeah I think the Celts would be a contender if the Jaybros played next to late-prime Kyle Lowry lol but they don't. Just those two guys as the foundation aren't going to get past the Nets/Bucks/Sixers/etc
"There's a whole generation of guards that I hate just because at some point some pundit, or analyst, or rando on this site said was better than Dame.   Kyrie Irving, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, to name a few. Most of these dudes are good guys and very fun to watch, but a part of me loves seeing them have a bad game in the pettiest way, because I know that at some point someone said with a straight face that they were a better player than Damian Lillard. These days Dame usually gets the respect he deserves, but like pre-2019 everybody was trying to act their favorite player was actually better than Dame because of some stupid shit and I still hate those players, just a little bit, because of it."
Davion Mitchell  Ceiling: Kyle Lowry  Floor: Tony Allen
"Kyle Lowry is a win now trade, we‚Äôre not a win now team yet"
Scenario C: Kyle Lowry
Great game by Luka. I think the Mavs should put together a Kyle Lowry trade. I think that will really help this team improve
That was a stressful game. Great 3rd quarter by the Wolves won them the game. 4th Q was painful. Nick Nurse and Kyle Lowry complaining to the refs is a devastating duo
Kyle Lowry at one point shot more ft's than our entire team and still had the nerve to complain.
Real talk tho every team needs a Kyle Lowry
"Fuck you Kyle Lowry,Fuck you Nick Nurse,Fuck you Refs and fuck you Toronto Raptors we are the northern."
Josh Okogie fouled on 3-point shot: no free throws. Kyle Lowry fouled on 3-point shot: 3 free throws. what
Thats delusional. Best of 7 this bulls team with lowry or cp3 is not beating the celtics.  You clearly don't watch the bulls if you think they would be the fucking 3rd seed with just kyle lowry or cp3 lol. I'm sorry dude either your being a massively bias bulls fan or a celtics hater but there is absolutely no way this team is making the second round just by adding lowry or cp3.   And even in a reality where they somehow do it still wont matter because in a couple of years when they leave or father time catches up to them we'll have the same problem we started with.
"Shoutout  to Kyle Lowry too, always hear about him doing a lot to support the community."
"Teams like the Nuggets and Mavs with playoff hopes but shitty defense would be willing to give some picks and young players for Smart. I could easily see a MPJ for Marcus Smart swap.  If we wanted to get crazy, I think Smart + tons of picks could land the Celtics Christian Wood (ik Rockets fans will crucify me, but you‚Äôd rather have 4 first rounders, trust me). I also think that picks + exception could get them a guy even as good as Kyle Lowry (not this exact player but a guy of that caliber and circumstance).  They could also benefit from a Steven Adams/Clint Capela, but I don‚Äôt know how realistic those options are.  Honestly, as long as the Celtics have two All-NBA level wings they will be competitive, but I doubt they could beat a defensive team like the Bucks or Sixers."
how tf is Kyle Lowry the greatest Raptor ever? Even casual fans know Vince Carter
"I like that you give credit to Kyle Lowry. In my oppinion, he definitely should have made a couple of all defense teams. For example, last year he lead the Raptors to the second best defense in the league but Pat Bev still got the second team defense nod over him."
Kyle lowry headed to the clippers.
I know Vuc isn't close to as good as Shaq or prime Dwight but he is about to become the magic franchise leader in points if he stays there forever he could become a Kyle Lowry esq franchise player
Kyle Lowry.
"So it seems like you think Kyle Lowry is undoubtedly the better player than CP3 with the way you‚Äôre shitting on CP3s accomplishments and propping up Lowrys like they‚Äôre any more impressive whatsoever. The east is and has been historically weak for the better part of the last decade, and Lowry still struggled mightily every single playoffs being labeled as a choked up until they picked up Kawhi. You got some real revisionist history. You must‚Äôve forgot when the rockets took the most OP ever created to 7 games only to lose because Cp3 got injured in game 6. Like I get it, Lowry is a great point guard and bonafide all star, but the disrespect you‚Äôre showing cp3 is very indicative of your homerism. Rip."
"Tell me where I said he's a better player?? Im arguing the fact that you're saying he's easily way better which is just stupid. You don't even know what's going on lmao.  And oh he leads mediocre rosters to playoff births? Like when Lowry led a lineup of him/DeRozan/Luis Scola/Demarre Carroll/Bismack Biyombo to the ECF where they took the champion Cavs to 6 games while Demar shat the bed consistently? Or like last year when he took Toronto 7 games against Boston's big 3 by himself while Pascal did his best to lose us every game? Or like how he's led Toronto to be one of the most successful franchises over the last decade regardless of who he plays with? Like oh god I'm CP3 led Schroeder, Dort, SGA, and Steven Adams to a first round exit what an untouchable god lmao.   Before last year's playoffs started Kyle was literally first place over a 5 year span in clutch shots hit in the playoffs. You're spewing nonsense."
"I couldn‚Äôt care less if you think I‚Äôm a ‚Äúhuge casual‚Äù. CP3 leads otherwise mediocre teams to playoff births, is a MUCH better passer than Lowry in all metrics, you‚Äôre overplaying how much better Lowrys defense is as well. Bro you‚Äôre really trying to argue that Kyle fuckin Lowry is a better basketball player than CP3? And you‚Äôre calling me a the casual fan? Hahaha whatever you‚Äôre just a complete homer."
Kyle Lowry didn't shoot much early in his career and in Memphis his percentages were in the 20's. Then he started improving to the respected shooter you see now.
Fines incoming for Kyle Lowry and Kemba Walker? Cut down on the flopping league-wide!!!
Yeah man kyle lowry is the heart of our team. Most important piece for sure.
"Sadly, those numbers are what 5 years/80m get you these days...if that. Kyle Lowry has been pretty shit for the stupid money he makes, and I‚Äôm not even sure Aaron Gordon is still in the league."
Kyle Lowry top 7 basically every season. Most underrated player in the league
Did Kyle Lowry get a warning for this?:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut-zbl0oIxc
Kyle Lowry isn't jacked but he's thicc
Between stars maybe. But I promise TJ Warren hates Jimmy Butler. And Kyle Lowry and Aaron Gordon hate each other
Every teams have a flaws and weaknesses. 76ers need another ball handler and Simmons can't do alone. Kyle Lowry would be perfect for them then they need stretch 5 when Embiid is on bench. Dwight and Simmons are rough to watch.
I'll be cheesed if CP3 makes all NBA and Kyle Lowry can't even get into the all star game.
Lol u just gonna slip Kyle Lowry in there like that
Laughs in Kyle ‚Äúbubble butt‚Äù Lowry
Kyle Lowry
*This has now turned into a Kyle Lowry thread*
"That‚Äôs the Steph Curry Kyle Lowry god chuck right there, it‚Äôs fate is sealed to swish"
"If Sixers get Kyle Lowry I‚Äôm positive they can come out of the East at the very least. Issue with that, however, is what position is Ben gonna play?"
Kyle Lowry was awesome!!!
"Dream trade is Kyle Lowry to the Sixers for Danny Green, Salary (Poirer/Scott), Thybulle, and a 1st.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough for Toronto though likely, I think they‚Äôd push for Maxey instead of Thybulle and I‚Äôm very hesitant to give him up."
"Whatever, man. Way too early on a saturday to be arguing with Raptors fans about the impact Kyle Lowry has had on our franchise.   You think standing in the game should be considered. I think his standing in relation to our teams history means more.   We‚Äôre not the Lakers or the Celtics, we‚Äôre a Canadian team in an American competition, and he dragged us out of irrelevancy."
"""I know the leafs have statues of players. But it's an entire row, not just one guy. And let's be honest, the Leafs have a much deeper and illustrious history than the Raps, there's no disputing that. ""  Raptors have to start somewhere, and objectively Kyle Lowry is that start."
So the only reason Alomar or Cito Gaston or Joe Carter would get a statue after close to 30 years is if the now gatekeeper Kyle Lowry gets his built first?
So why can't you build for Alomar AND Kyle?  That Alomar doesn't have one is a dumb reason to discredit Lowry
"So JYD should get a statue? Matt Bonner? And like I said, Kyle is a great player and he has meant a ton to the franchise. But so has Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon and this is just basketball. Where are there statues  Toronto is a one of the biggest metropolitan cities in North America. This isn't some small county, getting something such as a statue to not just symbolize someone but to immortalize them. Out of everyone from the Jays illustrious history, some of the great Maple leaf players from the 90s and 2000s. It's Lowry? Like I don't see get it. Have his number retired but don't overblow it and embarrass yourself with setting low standards."
Joe Carter deserves a statue before Kyle Lowry if we are judging by impact.
Why not more statues?   I personally would like to be reminded of the Kyle Lowry era here in Toronto every time I visit Scotia.   The Leafs haven't won anything of merit since my parents were born.
What about Kyle Lowry
Eric Bledsoe Kyle Lowry
"Bargnani?  He averaged 5.8 rebounds per 36 for his career. In his final year in Toronto, he was outrebounded by his teammate Kyle Lowry."
"Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts  You've been the same motherfucker since 2001  Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump  I'm at your house like, ""why you got your couch on my Chucks""  Motherfucker"
Kyle Lowry knows a thing or two about WAP
It always kills me when people honestly think there are 9 better point guards in this league than Kyle Lowry. No wonder dude plays with a chip on his shoulder.
Kyle Lowry is the real point god. Forget about Chris.
"Even though it only lasted one season, I would add Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, and Pascal Siakam to this list."
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
kyle lowry trade rumors heating up? Clippers? It's gonna happen!!

"So am I. rivalries change though. The Kyle lowry raptors are a legit rival, the games are always chippy and ref-baiting. No outside fan is turning up for a Boston-Chicago, new York, cleveland matchup expecting high tensions and playoff atmosphere. Not since rose, lebron and honey nut cheerios left"
That sounds like Kyle Lowry.
 Kyle Lowry looks like an abuela the way he wear that jersey on his thicc self
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Lmao   &gt;because he could form a super team in a nice place that was obviously a consequence of the cap.  They took paycuts to do that so what is going to stop that from doing it in any other situation?   &gt;When LeBron was done he went back to Cleveland who by that time had great talent,   They had Kyrie and TT and nothing else. But I'm ignorant.   &gt;Next year, signed big free agent like everyone knew they would,  Dudley is good but I wouldn't say he was a big free agent. Unless you mean AD, who we famously traded for. But again, I'm the ignorant one lmao.   &gt;And if the teams weren‚Äôt good because the east was bad at building that still has nothing to do with the argument.  It's the main reason LeBron made the finals all those years. His biggest competition was Paul George and Kyle Lowry. Not exactly the cream of the crop.  In the future if you're going to be this rude, at least be a tiny bit correct."
ESPN: Is there BEEF between the Tampa Raptors‚Äô Kyle Lowry and Tom Brady?
"saying ""noooo"" isnt a good argument. after going 2-8 where we stunk we went 10-5 where Kyle siakam and yes fred have been playing exceptional. Siakam is averaging something like 26 the last 6 games and his season average isnt as terrible as r/nba would have made you think.  &amp;#x200B;  If we end up with a winning record or a top 4-6 seed then he would 100% be deserving a spot.  &amp;#x200B;  and lowry is going to win the coaches vote and it will piss everyone who doesnt watch him off"
PB should be traded for Kyle Lowry or VanVleet
"Lavine has a lower TOV% than James Harden, Ben Simmons, Paul George, Kyle Lowry, Lamelo and Trae Young and is only two spots behind Lebron. So no, I wouldn't say the advanced metrics show this."
He can always come back for his last year or two. Trade Lowry for a young piece who you can develop and maybe give Kyle another chance to compete for a chip on a different roster.
I think the raptors should Kyle Lowry to the Bucks for Khris Middleton.
Yeah Kyle Lowry vs Hill was just *not* the right pair of dudes to make that work. Kyle plowing through was like when a horse-size dog doesn't know he's not a puppy anymore and jumps into his owner's arms.
I think he can be Kyle Lowry. I really do.
"Would be an automatic legend for that franchise. Like seriously. And honestly, would be viewed as an iconic ""franchise"" player around the league too, similar to Kyle Lowry or Dame."
Kyle Lowry has as many dunk contest titles as bumass Aaron Gordon
I think both teams say no. The Mavs aren't one 35 year old Kyle Lowry from a championship and the Raps can get better value than that.
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/02/08/report-some-within-raptors-believe-toronto-should-trade-kyle-lowry/
"Marcus Smart Kyle Lowry, is that you?"
what kind of assets do you think Pat Riley will give up for Kyle Lowry?
"lmao FUCK KD but this is adorablelol  &gt;Durant said he started to feel better about his decision during his time with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  ‚ÄúI was worried about how my peers were going to feel about me,‚Äù he told Steinberg. ‚ÄúIn my profession, that‚Äôs the only thing I care about. So when I was talking to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and they were like, ‚ÄòCongrats, man, do your thing,‚Äô and Paul George was like, ‚ÄòCongrats, man, I am happy for you,‚Äô and Kevin Love was like, ‚ÄòShoot, do what you gotta do,‚Äô that eased my mind a little bit, because I want that from my peers.‚Äù"
Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan
1. Steph 2. Jokic 3. LBJ 4. Kawhi 5. Giannis 6. AD 7. Lillard 8. Bradley beal 9. Wetbrook 10. trae young 11. Tatum 12. Kat 13. PG 14. Embid 15. Booker 16. Butler 17. Mitchell 18. KD 19. Kyrie 20. Harden 21. Ben simmons 22. chris paul 23. Cj Muccollum 24. Kyle LOwry 25. Murray
It would probably be win win. Only teams looking for a Kyle Lowry type getting paid that much this year are contenders. So it's not like Masai could dump him off to the Cavs or something.
"biggest sellers maybe the raptors cause kyle lowry is old and they might want to trade him while he still has value, and buyers well you have the obvious nets lakers, clippers"
"Raptors are sellers. Not selling the whole team, just Kyle Lowry, who is likely to be the biggest name moved unless Beal changes his mind and decides that losing is bad, actually."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
DeMar was the heart and soul of the franchise when he was there. he was Mr Toronto.  don't take this as a shot on Kyle Lowry though. He's one of my favorite players in the league and an awesome defender.
"yeah luckily he's also a good playmaker and rebounder, as well as being a statistically proven clutch performer. nobody thought Kyle Lowry was better than DeMar DeRozan during any year that they were both playing together.  which is why the Spurs traded for DeRozan and not Lowry.  trying to make a case for Lowry as a top 20 player of the last decade is hilarious."
"Plus we're also trying to keep a roster flexible for the future, trading a bunch of younger guys for one year of Kyle Lowry isn't a great idea"
"Maxey and Thybulle are good but Philly fans would see the value of Lowry if they get to see him next to Ben Simmons and Joel.             Kyle is one of the best floor generals in the NBA, he has always been top of most advance stats."
"Lowry for Simmons &gt;.&lt;  Honestly yeah, if Kyle wants a trade you make it work for him, but if not you hold him for dear life. Make more big booty beautiful memories"
"Sixers has agreed to trade Danny Green and Matisse Thybulle to Toronto for Kyle Lowry and u/TopBeer3000, sources tell ESPN."
It is one of the worst. I was told Kyle for Maxey and Tybulle is a bad trade but the same person posted that we should trade Kyle Lowry to Portland for Zach Collins and fillers.
"He's like a big man Kyle Lowry, I can appreciate that."
Y‚Äôall need to go get Kyle Lowry
I'd rather trade norm  Kyle lowry 4 life
kyle lowry is a lock if he wins another ring or has deep playoff run(s)
they're one kyle lowry short of having a real earnest shot in the playoffs
Part of the Raptors experience minus Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry alone worth 2 1st rounders and Drummond &amp; Osman
Andre Drummond - Kyle Lowry straight up üëÄ
Kyle Lowry inbound pass lol cmon now
"Trading Kyle Lowry is just stupid. The young guys' BBIQ probably increases just from standing next to him and he'll be able to run a bench unit until he's 40. This is definitely some bullshit the Clippers or Philly is spouting, and they have nothing good to realistically offer us so why are they even trying?"
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry smokes the Jazz every single time
You called Josh Hart a better pure scorer than Kyle Lowry I think this deserves a 24 hour ban tbh.
"Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Joe Ingles, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo.  League fucked."
6 ft 10 Kyle Lowry
"They‚Äôre fine in highlights and bits and pieces. But a whole game? Holy shit chill a little bit lol. Raptors will be losing by 20, Lowry will hit an open 3 &amp; they‚Äôll go wOAAAAAAAA HE HIT THAT FROM OTTTAWAAA!! KYLE LOWRY THE BEST RAPTOR OF ALLLLLL TIME!!! TAKE A BOW KYLE"
"&gt;Dray isn't a net positive on offense  That's not even close to accurate. Dude isn't averaging 9apg by being bad at offense, he's doing it by blowing up 4 on 3s whenever Curry draws doubles, as he has for years. That's why Kerr is so diligent about keeping them on the floor together (even moreso then his defense). GSW as a whole and Curry's own splits with/without Draymond back this up, going back several years.  &gt;oubre and wiggins do get staggered.  Oubre plays more than 80% of his minutes with Curry. Contrast with players like Kyle Lowry and Donovan Mitchell, or to a lesser extent Anthony Davis and CJ McCollum, who all played somewhere from 55% to 68% of their minutes with their team's top player this year or last year -- that's what staggering looks like. No wonder Curry's on/offs look better than LeBron's or Dame's when their 2nd best player is on the court most of the time they're off of it, while Curry plays with his best teammates 96% and 81% of the time."
"Folks, the science is clear: Kyle Lowry is unequivocally the most thicc player the league has ever seen."
"Then trade his ass, this is Chris fucking Paul were talking about not Kyle Lowry"
I especially sympathize with Toronto cuz seems like theirs season is cursed. Stuck in Tampa and players probably with virus now.   Might as well take a gap year  And if the Sixers havvvve to take Kyle Lowry so be it ;)
Jimmy Butler is routinely near the top of RPM boards for a reason he's among the the top impact players of this era. Some guy's dominance is not always shown in the stat sheet. Kyle Lowry is like this as well
"Mike Conley, Ja Morant, Kyle Lowry, JJJ, Pau Gasol.  I'm playing Lowry as a big booty 5, and moving JJJ to the 3 and Pau to the 4.  Also I just learned we are historically p good at selecting point guards"
Kyle Lowry was the playmaker on that team. He even averaged 6 assists in that series.   Seriously did you watch games?? You‚Äôre gonna start point out single games soon
"I think the best way to put it, is that Kawhi had a single player who can do it all at any point in the game - Kyle could come and be the leading scorer, leading playmaker, or best defender at any time when needed. He wasn't a superstar, but he was absolutely an all-star.  On the other hand, Dirk was surrounded high IQ, but super specialized role players. JET was mainly just a scoring punch, Kidd was really just getting guys in their spots and defending (virtually 0 shot creating or driving ability). Stevenson was as 3 and D and nothing else as anyone could be. Chandler was a rim protector. All super valuable traits that helped our team, but it still all fell onto Dirk to close games and lead the offense down the stretch.   On the other hand, when the Raptors needed a bucket, they had 4 other very good three point shooters on the floor and two guys in Lowry and FVV who could create and hit their own shot. Underrated aspect is that they also had a ton of guys who were good passers (Gasol, Lowry, FVV) Even Siakam was averaging 3+ assists per game despite playing with all those guys handling the ball more. Neither played with a true star, but Kawhi had more versatile players around him than Dirk imo"
"While the rest I can understand, Kidd is not even remotely equal to Lowry. Lowry was an all-star. While J Kidd played a huge role for us defensively, he literally was incapable of driving to the hoop by that point. Kyle could do anything at any time in the game.   Lowry could be a leading scorer, he can be your lead playmaker, and he could play fantastic defense. Our team didn't have like a single one player who could step up and do everything like that, but we had a bunch of guys who specialized in one or two things (though they were vets who played smart and minimized mistakes as well) sand everything hinged on Dirk's ability to close out games in the end."
"Kawhi had another all-star level player on his team with Kyle Lowry and Siakam won MIP that year.  In the year Dirk won, no one in his team was voted an All-star, but he did have Tyson Chandler who was in all-defensive 2nd team. That's about it tho."
Kyle Lowry. Make it Happen Pat Riley.
This. Tisse has been on fire lately and has just been incredible. I will not give him up for old ass Kyle Lowry.
"&gt;Look without even seeing the game I'm sure Lowry was upset at the ref.   ... I'm not even sure this was the case here. Yeah, he's usually mad at the ref, but it was a timeout, they were advancing the ball, and he through a literal bounce pass to the ref where the ball would be advanced to. This is Kyle Lowry, if he wanted to through a hard aggressive pass... it would have been a hard aggressive pass.  Not a bounce pass that neatly landed 6 feet from the ref."
"if kyle lowry wanted to yell at the refs, kyle lowry would yell at the refs"
Jazz fan and Kyle Lowry fan here That's some grade a bull crap
The only big trade that will happen is Kyle Lowry to the 76ers. But other than that i expect a lot more buyouts this year.
"Honestly, Lowry to Philly is probably gonna happen after our recent 5 game losing streak.  Unfortunately, it's gonna be a really tough uphill climb for the Raptors to make the playoffs with Kyle since OG/FVV/Siakam caught COVID (it's gonna take months for them to fully recover)."

That player's name?  Kyle Lowry  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/7432477/houston-rockets-kyle-lowry-charged-battery-las-vegas
disgusting act by Kyle Lowry!
"""Kyle lowry throwing back""  Cmon cameron crew, you really failed to capture that... I'm so disappointed..."
"This conversation is wild. The Raptors aren't going anywhere this year or in the foreseeable future. Thats facts. When healthy with a tight rotation they could probably steal a 4/5 series but that's about it.   The Sixers are not going to have success in the playoffs with Ben Simmons as their primary ball handler/second option. This is also facts. We've seen this with Giannis as well and Ben Simmons is very much a poor mans Giannis.  I think this Philly team as constructed will be a tough out in the 2nd round. Miami, Milwaukee, or Boston can definitely beat them. Indiana, or a even a healthy Toronto might be able to upset them as well but I think that's unlikely.   If you think Ben Simmons is better than Kyle Lowry, particularly in the playoffs, I don't really know what to say to you. Philly should be all in on Lowry, especially if they can somehow keep Thybulle and Danny Green.   Ben Simmons is a quality starter but he's definitely overrated. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Devin Booker is overrated and that dude is a flamethrower. Khris Middleton is overrated and he's a 50/40/90 guy. Overrated does not mean bad."
Disagree. I only watch the NBA to see Referees when I turn on a Raptors game I want to see Refs not NBA Champion Kyle Lowry.
He must've had money on Kyle Lowry not finishing the game.
Kyle and Markkanen should get married. Lauri Lowry
How about Kyle Lowry
"2016 Warriors  Literally any SF besides Harrison Barnes. Give us Doug McDermott we winning.  2020 Clippers  Kyle Lowry  Hot take, but this team is obviously missing a floor general and playmaker, I think they would have imploded much less last season with Lowry at PG"
"i mean tbf why is kyle throwing the ball to that ref and not the one next to him...?   is this the ref who gave him the first T? cuz that would make a lot of sense   plus it's kyle lowry and he bitches so much, he didn't even put up much of a fight on this one"
Kyle Lowry
It's criminal the way our players are robbing Kyle Lowry of assists
"&gt;This is also assuming Kyle walks in the offseason, which everyone seems to assume even though there's nothing but baseless speculation backing that up.   You'd have to assume Masai has some insight into that. If Lowry does get moved, I think we have to assume that he was probably gonna walk, even if that's never officially reported. If he's told Masai he'd prefer to re-sign in the off-season, even at a much lower rate, then I'm guessing Masai would be loathe to trade him. Rather than speculate about what is going on behind the scenes, I'm content to just wait and see what happens. We'll know soon enough."
"People keep underrating Middleton lol, even though he‚Äôs relatively old he‚Äôs following that Kyle Lowry trajectory and can be way better in the future"
"You do understand that the core of the Raptors has come from picks like that, right???  Siakam (pick 27) OG (pick 23) Norm Powell (pick 46) FVV (undrafted)   Even Kyle Lowry was a mid 20‚Äôs pick.  I don‚Äôt think you understand how valuable FRPs are to franchises with competent drafting/scouting/development staff."
"I don't know about this one (and this is coming from someone who thinks Kyle Lowry will a Hall-of-Famer sometime down the line).  I think what hurts Rondo's case is that after he left Boston, he kind of bounced around the league and not really being associated with any team. He redeemed himself somewhat contributing to the Lakers' championship last year.  Very good and smart player, but I think his career falls short of the Hall of Fame."

Why do I feel like this is a Kyle Lowry recruitment video?
Lakers- Add Bradley Beal   nets- Add Andrew Wiggins and Kyle Lowry   Pretty even still maybe edge to nets
Kyle Lowry.
"yes they should, starting with kyle lowry"
`Kyle Lowry/s`
"kyle lowry/jerami grant/lonzo ball/harrison barnes are the best players that could be traded. Barnes could net two picks maybe more depending on what is being returned. Lowry is probably the hardest guy to gauge, but a couple firsts would probably be in order. Ball probably gets trade for a young piece + picks if pelicans don't plan on re-signing him. Grant probably nets a couple picks + salary filler."
"Easily Kyle Lowry. If Philly wants to go all in to win the championship, a trade for Lowry would go a long way"
I weren‚Äôt backtraking? And literally admitted is misread it. The best player he met in that 2018 playoffs was what? A young Jason Tatum? Kyle Lowry? The fact that the east was such a dumpster fire makes it not impressive.
Am I the only one who thinks Kyle Lowry replacing Westbrook doesn't make the Wizards much better?
"Trae is one dimensional and heavily relies on foul baiting, something not sustainable especially in playoff games, pretty sure he averages more free throws made than field goals.  I've also watched more hawks games than I should've this year and his passing really isn't elite. His high assist totals are more due to him being one of the highest usage players in the league than anything else.  He's an empty calorie stat stuffer and his game while fun to watch at times just isn't conducive to a winning culture at all, especially factoring in that he's one of the biggest defensive liabilities in the league. I may be biased but there's no way you could convince me that if you needed one game, or one series, you'd take him over Kyle Lowry."
"Just saw this. I meant career potential since it‚Äôs what this post was about. Obviously Ja and SGA are both better than Lamelo today.   SGA is already a 50/40/90 level scorer from all 3 levels. Mechanically he is much more sound than lamelo. Already one of the best scorers in the league in only his third season. Elite level scoring. Really really underrated player, probably the most underrated in the league. And defensively Shai is a dog with the mindset of a Kyle Lowry. Lamelo is a better passer right now though  Ja id take over lamelo just based on his level of aggression and athleticism. Similar level of passing to lamelo. Melo is a better shooter than Ja and has better size than ja also. And as I said I think this is closer.  Melo is really good which is why he‚Äôs even in this convo"
"Closest approximation I can find is DeRozan and Lowry. Demar was the best scorer when he was here, even had a 27ppg season one time, but Kyle did literally everything else better. If an MVP award had to go to our team for any season the two were together it would always be Kyle.   That's the same situation I am seeing here. Booker is clearly the better scorer, but Paul does everything else better and his overall contributions lead towards winning basketball more than Booker solely scoring does.   As seen by the dramatic change from a perennial lottery team to a  home seed in the playoffs team."
"If we're competing, I'd want one of Richaun Holmes, Marvin Bagley, Khem Birch or Mo Bamba. All those guys should be within our price range (Raptors can't really match salaries for Drummond).  But if we're trading Kyle Lowry, then I'd want at least a prospect, 1FRP and expiring salary. Ideally, I'd wanna get an additional pick or some decent role players with the returning salary."
"Clips could really use Kyle Lowry or Vucevic. I doubt we have the assets to get either though. Would also love Brogdon, but again, I doubt the Pacers would do it for [LouWill + Morris + pick(s)](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yxdjjcv6)."
"Players can get better in their late 20's, Kyle Lowry is a prime example."
"When Kyle Lowry goes under, Marcus goes over"
He needs a good pull up jump shot and he‚Äôs the SG Kyle Lowry
"They are a team that is probably going to lose in the 2nd round or even the 1st round as presently constituted, but has 80% of a championship puzzle piece completed, and if they traded for Kyle Lowry, I could see them winning it all.   They need that Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday ish type point guard to win a chip, that's the last piece IMO."
"I would argue that he's entertaining in a different way, at least for Celtics fans. What he doesn't provide in scoring he provides in everything else. I've never seen a guard make the absolutely INSANE defensive and hustle plays he does, and the little things really add up. I understand that its probably frustrating to watch in a Kyle Lowry type way for opposing fans but I really, really love his style of play.  Also he doesn't really flop at the same rate as trae or harden, he has some REALLY bad ones but it's kind of overblown because it hits the front page of r/nba when he does do it"
Still not as goofy as that time Kyle Lowry took George Hill for a horsey ride
"""Players you hate to play against, but love if they're on your team"" team  &amp;#x200B;  G: Chris Paul  G: Kyle Lowry  F: Tony Allen  F: Kevin Garnett  C: Joakim Noah  Bench: Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Matt Barnes, Anderson Varajao, Andrew Bogut"
"And we have the leverage to sign and trade him wherever he wants next season rather than take bottom of the rotation players and bad picks for a great asset. The prospect of losing Kyle for nothing isn‚Äôt very real, and it certainly wouldn‚Äôt be to Philly because your roster can‚Äôt improve without trade. If you think Thybulle or Milton is too much to give up for Lowry then I don‚Äôt see how a trade ever happens. Maxey had one good game this season and now he‚Äôs the key piece of a Lowry trade. That‚Äôs not a good ROI at all"
"I don‚Äôt see how you guys have any other path to getting him without a trade. Lowry indicated he‚Äôd like to stay, Lowry is also a top 15 player and a top 10 PG. Sorry, your 3rd string rookie bench PG bad picks and salary dumps isn‚Äôt enough to make our division rivals better.   Good luck trying to sign Kyle if Thybulle and/or Milton is too much to give for an all star PG lmao"

"Rondo will definitely make it before KYLE FN LOWRY, you must be out your gd mind."
Kyle Lowry with squats
Kyle Lowry
I will willingly forego answering this in fear of my answer being the domino to a Kyle Lowry trade
"I think there was a study released last weekend that said that most NBA players tend to lose a second of reaction time at age 34. Search ""Kyle Lowry Rule 34"" to learn more."
"It's a business. We are a playoff team, and will remain a playoff team. Kyle Lowry is on our team, and him leaving weakens us.  We will play the Sixers at some point, and we'd rather do that without Lowry against us. For this, Sixers gotta pay a premium.  Furthermore, we need a C. Without that hole being fixed there's little use in tying up money just to make Sixer fans happy.  Highly doubt we tie up a good chunk of our free cap space without even fixing the one glaring hole on the roster we have.     We aren't moving on from Norman Powell and Terence Davis for Maxey lol"
KYLE LOWRY üò≠üò≠üò≠
Sorry to disappoint you but Kyle Lowry aka a winner isn't gonna let that happen
Not trading Kyle Lowry to Philly seems weird at this point
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
"I swear the Celtics bad luck started when they did Isaiah Thomas dirty by trading him after he played through injuries and his sister passing away in the playoffs. Kyrie didn‚Äôt work out, and neither is Kemba really, he coulda been their Kyle Lowry."
Lmao by that logic Kyle Lowry is better than both of them because he has a championship (which obviously isn‚Äôt true)  You should really learn how to analyze players more deeply than ‚Äúdid their team win or lose‚Äù
"I get the Lauri (Kyle Lowry), Coby (Kobe Bryant) references, but who is the current All Star/historical great Wendle (Wendell Carter) in relation to?"
"Kyle Lowry impacts the game better than Trae, Jamal, and Fox do."
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry
"if you're going to trade kyle lowry, there is really only like 2-3 teams that would go for him. Miami, Clippers, Philly (and MAYBE denver)  Miami would have to give hero/robinson (which i doubt they will)+additional for $ sake (they have no good picks either)  Clippers have noone good to trade or  good picks  Denver would need to give a slew of players/picks (MPJ?)  Philly has maxey+picks and salary to match  so it does make sense if we were to trade to get SOMETHING decent in return"
"That‚Äôs not the greatest thought process. Kyle Lowry was a bench player, Harden was just a guy that came off the bench for OKC, and Steph had glass ankles in the early part of their careers."
Currently my second favorite team is Toronto Raptors because of Kyle Lowry and the fanbase.
"No. Not a chance.   It wasn‚Äôt just Kawhi‚Äôs phenomenal offense that season, but also his insane lockdown defence that put the Raptors over the top.   Combine that with the perfect storm of great team chemistry, great team defence, complimentary players at every position, impact players off the bench, Kyle Lowry leadership, Nick Nurse coaching, and everything just fell beautifully into place for that Championship run.  The perfect storm."
Yes. Harden and Kyle Lowry would have suffocated those teams with their incredible ass cheeks.
i fucking love kyle lowry
"Not true, I am gay and I am worth about a Wendy‚Äôs 4 for 4 and a Kyle Lowry Swingman jersey‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
When Kyle Lowry takes a charge in the first minute of his first game as a Sixer &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"You need a Kyle Lowry type who playmakes, does the little things like collecting long rebounds and loose balls, defends hard, and takes a backseat in scoring but still can create his own shot when the game slows down."
I mean I would think the only way would be if Lowry really wanted to go there and if the FO would respect losing him at loss for his preference. Possible scenario but I doubt Kyle seems them as best contender and would be ok going to his hometown of Philly or elsewhere
Was there when he bullied Serge and got the and 1 to ice a game against the Raptors. Got a Raps T signed by DDR and Kyle Lowry. Awesome to see LA do his thing and get fired up.
"philly fans trashing him for the past couple years, to now watching them twerk for Kyle Lowry is hilarious"
"I've got this saved so here goes:   We've got 23m in cap space next year. If norm opts out, it becomes 34. That's without 7m to opt in to Bouchers team option (we'd be dumb not to). Bembry team option is 2m. Keep both of those guys on, we're down to 25m in space to keep norm, lowry and TD. Let's say we sign lowry at 25, norm at 15 and TD at 5. We end riiiiight at the luxury tax threshold. Then you need to fill the roster holes created by baynes, Matt, Stanley and Mccaw not being kept on. Find a bunch of minimum guys? Sure. That still puts us over the luxury tax. That also means that we have a 6m MLE, instead of the 9.5m if we weren't paying the tax.  It's really a choice between signing Kyle, norm, or keeping cap space open to bid on RFAs."
"Kyle Lowry, our leader and greatest raptor of all time. Also super underrated."
Would Kyle Lowry not be worth a lot more than an exception?
"Thats fair, but Chris Paul was 33 when he signed his contract and he has had a much much better career than Kyle Lowry. I don‚Äôt trust signing any 35 year old to 25M/yr unless its LeBron."
Kyle Lowry also agrees for $50 million
"Just to add, he also transformed his body after the 2015 playoffs leading up to the 2015-18 success.  He was pretty pudgy before that and his body breaking down on him late that year leading to the wizards sweep really solidified a change his mentality about health/body maintenance.  Article about the change: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14619667/nba-kyle-lowry-transformed-body-elevated-game-all-star-levels"
"bro he's giving them a whole 7.5, 2.5, and 2.5 a game, you can't replace that production with some nerd like kyle lowry lmao"
Kyle Lowry
unless you're kyle lowry?
"Jokic, Zion, Haliburton, Kyle Lowry, Steph Curry.   Offensively this team would be so fun to watch. Defensively, I would not be surprised if the team gives up a bucket every single possession.   The team would probably be 3rd seed in the east and 6th seed in the west"
One. Lebron  Sixteen infinities in a row  Two. Chris Paul  Three. Rajon Rondo  Four. Kyle Lowry  Five. Marc Gasol
And that minority owner that tried to shove Kyle Lowry in the finals
"Kyle Lowry, John Collins, Robert Williams III, Anthony Edwards, Demar Derozan.  Defence blows so we're probably a first round exit."
Kyle Lowry   James Harden  Kevin Durant   Chris Boucher  Serge Ibaka  That‚Äôs a championship squad
"Yeah this is what the people who root for a single player and go for team to team rooting for that individual's success are missing out on. The greatest joy from sports often come from the team building aspect.  Watching players you drafted and have only been a part of your franchise achieve winning a championship is honestly so special. I don't even care what people say about Kawhi, Siakam or Kyle Lowry or whatever in terms of legacies or being slandered or whatever. The joy in winning that ring is seeing guys like Pascal, Norm, OG, FVV who spent their entire career with the Raptors grow into being part of a championship team. The joy was seeing Kyle Lowry's name being chanted by the crowd when we made the finals.    None of these ""asterisk"" talk matter in that context LOL like I honestly don't even care. Fans can knock them out talking about all that stuff but none of it matters"
"Pg: Kyle Lowry  Sg: Demar Derozan  Sf: Vince Carter  Pf: Kawhi Leonard   C: Chris Bosh   Possible bench: calderon, jv, fvv, siakam, ibaka"
"Kyle Lowry yelled, ‚ÄúYou will always be a part of this history!"" OG Anunoby gave a look of pleasant surprise. Pascal Siakam belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking tank squad now.‚Äù And before Norman Powell hit the locker room door, ex-teammate Fred Vanvleet hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúThugs cry too. It‚Äôs cool, bro.‚Äù"
"PG: Kyle Lowry - Obvious choice, greatest raptor of all time.  SG: Vince Carter - The OG franchise player, contributed to making the raptors good for the first time.  SF: Kawhi Leonard - Led the team to its first and only championship.  PF: DeMar DeRozan - Was the franchise player for years before the championship. He represents one of the best stretches of raptors basketball.  C: Chris Bosh - Was the franchise player after Carter."
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry has done quite a bit for Toronto
"Idk about that, Kyle Lowry has done quite a bit for Toronto"
They were weak because LeBron beat them. Remember two years later when kawhi left? And suddenly the same team with Kyle Lowry w/o DeMar was better? The east suddenly became better when LeBron left. Last year all I heard was how the lakers will face the best 8th seed in NBA history since the rockets. Then will lose to Harden and Westbrook. And then lose to the comeback kids. At first I didnt believe the east was strong. Then you see him rollover the teams in the west and then realize how weak his team is.   He rolled over all of those teams with pathetic squad. Last years lakers squad is nowhere as good as this years. Kuzma has finally found his role. McGee was playoff trash. Rondo was the only good role player on the team. KCP was hitting shots during the first two series but cooled off. Our role players are much better.
He‚Äôs like a Delmar DeRosen or a Kyle Lowry.
Nobody has even heard of Kyle Korver. I put him in the same category as Kyle Lowry (&amp; not just because they have the same first name).
"I‚Äôve been wrong before, so I‚Äôm not going to say NO ONE will offer him that amount (cough, Knicks), but that is an overpay by many millions of dollars per year.  Dude needs to concentrate on hitting his layups (let alone his free throws) before he commands Kyle Lowry money."
Imagine how different that game would have been if you had Kyle Lowry now
kyle lowry üçë ain't no spot up shooter üèÄ he aint gotta run üèÉüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to the corner to shoot üéÜ like hes some 3rd option bitch üíØ this aint jj redick üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this is a fuckin godüôèüèº human steph curry ü•ò come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy üê± pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you üëäüèø at the same time
Kyle Lowry is the best fat Pg of all time....way better than Raymond Felton
"Kyle Lowry ain't no spot up.... Argh, you know the rest."
 I wanted a Kyle Lowry top shot but that shit is expensive.
Raptors fans will die on a hill defending Kyle Lowry going into the HOF if they have to debate his induction against Wilt Chamberlain.
"All rings are real in that they *exist*, but you know what the other commentator was saying  Is a KD ‚ÄúI got my shit kicked in by Steph Curry, I‚Äôm gonna go hide behind him from now on‚Äù Championship Ring worth the same as a Kyle Lowry ‚ÄúGreatest Raptor of All Time, Hard Work Rewarded‚Äù Ring?  Is a KD ring the same as a Hakeem ring, or a Dirk ring, etc etc etc.   That‚Äôs for everyone individually to decide for themselves"
Kyle Lowry
"It isn‚Äôt just that it creates clicks, it creates conversations.   There is only so much you can say about Kyle Lowry as a player playing on the Raptors. For the most part the national media wouldn‚Äôt really be overly interesting talking a lot about Kyle Lowry‚Äôs performances every night as the Raptors are having a down year, Lowry is 35 and nearing the end of his career, and he isn‚Äôt overly a ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù type player. This appeals to fans of Lowry (mainly Raptors fans, and mainly Canadians).   However with the exact same player you can fill the air talking about potential trades for Lowry. You can talk about what teams he would be good on, what teams are interested in Lowry, what teams Lowry is interested in, what potential trade packages could be or the rumours of what the offerings are. This in turns includes a lot more teams which creates more overall interest in stories around Lowry.   Now that‚Äôs an example of a player that went through the entire cycle, and he was an actual trade target. The main point is though that stories of players being on other teams just gather more interest, so it is better for the media  to have trades and to talk about trades."
Most teams don‚Äôt have Kyle Joseph Lowry
People actually commenting Kyle Lowry what a joke
1. JRUE HOLIDAY  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  2. Steph   3. CP3  4. Westbrook  5. Dame  Honorable mention: Kyle Lowry
1. Steph   2. Russ   3. Kyrie   4. CP3   5. Kyle Lowry
If that happens we will need a PG lol. Kyle Lowry also available though which I‚Äôd rather pay him 20+ million on a short term deal than pay shroeder.
"Plenty of PGs potentially available if you want to overpay and if jrue or cp3 opt out. I‚Äôd expect jrue to opt in and cp3 to opt out if the suns have middling playoff success. You can grab Lonzo if you‚Äôre willing to overpay, mike Conley, shroeder or Kyle Lowry. If we see cp3 opt out pg is the only position imo where people have a couple options that aren‚Äôt shit. Couple shooting guards available to but the rest of it is pretty shit."
"Not at all - Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, we can throw 2 year/40 million deals and see what happens."
"Jesus, between him and Lonzo the market this summer for a PGs is going to be fucked. CP3, mike Conley and Kyle Lowry all can be free agents too if cp3 opts out."
Kyle Lowry should learn this type of defense
"I don't agree; there are teams where a 2 year, $50 million contract for Lowry is still on the table if they don't have to give anything up.   For example, the Knicks could sign Kyle Lowry and have him off the books by the time RJ Barrett's rookie contract ends."
"&gt; Kyle Lowry himself has admitted he was out of shape as hell when he first got to the league  Kyle Lowry was out of shape if you compare him to the NBA. These dudes are not getting injured because they're ""out of shape"", they're getting inured because they're playing a sport at superhuman speed. It's disrespectful as fuck to imply John Wall would just be fine if he only conditioned more. The dude is a professional athlete."
"Lmaooo if you compare him to the average person yeah, not compared to the NBA. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre being willfully ignorant to pretend like NBA guys are infallible Gods who are only here to workout and smash pussy, Kyle Lowry himself has admitted he was out of shape as hell when he first got to the league"

"Usually if you‚Äôre over the salary cap, you can‚Äôt trade for players with a higher salary - for example, the Lakers couldn‚Äôt trade Wes Matthews (making the minimum) for Kyle Lowry (making $35M/year). But, if you trade a player for a lower salaried player or draft picks, the NBA lets you roll the difference forward -  so if the Lakers had traded LeBron (making $40M/yr) for the Raptor‚Äôs 2021 draft pick (officially paid $0/yr), they have a $40M ‚Äúcredit‚Äù to use on a player within 12 months, even if they‚Äôre right at the cap.    OKC has six of these credits to use within 12 months of the trade that created the credit. The $27M exception, for instance, was created by trading Steven Adams‚Äô contract for some 2nd round picks and minimum players, which is $27M - $0 for salary cap purposes. So they get to use that $27M on another trade."
No Kyle Lowry type floor general
"Not sure what the point is of your first comment. Are you being sarcastic because you think I'm lying about watching games (lol) or because you know you have no argument? As for your second inane comment, you're right it's not actually possible to be a good player on a bad team. Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam are terrible because the Raptors are only half a game up on Washington. Lavine is terrible for a similar reason, as are KAT, Shai, and Zion."
"I've been pro tank since the 1-6 stretch to start the season. The proposed packages for Kyle were still complete trash and not worth trading Lowry for, even in a tank season. Besides, as shown by tonight, Lowry's continued presence is not stopping the tank"
"Tbh it would probably be criticized no matter what happens. If Kyle was traded for a weak offer, people would say Masai has lost his touch and doesn't respect Kyle's value. Now we didn't trade him and the discussion is that we're disrespecting his wishes? The only way it would be positive is if he got a Jrue-lite return for Lowry and seems like Miami and Philly didn't want to pay that much. I'm not upset Kyle is still around. He wants a decent payday in the off-season but I'm not sure what team will want to pay him that much either. Maybe we get to re sign him on a more reasonable deal too."
"Ngl, I know almost nothing about Kyle Lowry. All I can say is that Griffin burned extremely bright for a short short time."
Is it similar to how Kyle Lowry really developed his game in Toronto after many years on other teams?

"[Spears] Kyle Lowry yelled, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù OG gave a look of disappointment. Pascal Siakam belted, ‚ÄúWe ain‚Äôt got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Fred VanVleet hit the locker room door, ex-Raptor coach Dwane Casey hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
They need an elite PG who can create their own shot and play make. Basically Kyle Lowry
They need an elite PG who can create their own shot and play make. Basically Kyle Lowry
Nobody said he was the #2 option. But he was clearly the second best player on that squad.  Here‚Äôs a place for you to start to learn  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26682825/what-drives-kyle-lowry-unexplainable-basketball-genius
"&gt; I don't see people blaming Jeanie Buss for not getting Kyle Lowry or whoever owns the Sixers for not pulling the trigger on Harden for Simmons  This ignores so much context. Morey (the Philly GM) tried to get Harden for Simmons but apparently, Tillman (the Houston owner) didn't want to help Morey. Jeanie, as far as we know, had no input in the Lowry situation. Likewise Dolan has done the bare minimum for the Knicks in that he hired Leon Rose, shut the fuck up, and signs checks. Leon and Thibs have been the ones that turned the team around"
Inb4 everyone blames Tillman when it was Morey that put this team in the position it's in. You can blame the owner all you want but i don't see it done elsewhere. I don't see people blaming Jeanie Buss for not getting Kyle Lowry or whoever owns the Sixers for not pulling the trigger on Harden for Simmons. Is Dolan going to get credit for turning the team around or is it just the bad stuff?
"redditors who comment on every thread about kyle lowry in shambles rn, begging (thru text) for steph to stop stealing their jokes"

I mean Kyle Lowry has been good for a long time
"""Rest Up Kyle"" Kyle Lowry will play in tomorows game after a hard screen collision with Dwight Howard"
In deciding playoff games Kyle Lowry puts up better numbers than his career regular season numbers just in case anyone is trying to say he‚Äôs a playoff choker in the comments.
there's more to a HOF career than just raw numbers. on top of his accolades Reggie was a big star and one of the most popular/notorious players in the league. he and his playoff performances/Knicks rivalry are a big part of the story of the NBA in the 90s. Kyle Lowry is just Kyle Lowry
"&gt; That's not a very nice thing to say. Raptors were lacking in depth at the PG spot. Jeremy Lin brings a somewhat decent player to get minutes in case Lowry or VanVleet was injured.  Right, it's how the buyout market should be working IMO. I'm not knocking Jeremy Lin, I got why we got him, I'm just saying in comparison to LMA and Drummond.   &gt; That's just a ridiculous statement. Your only title was based around a mercenary for 1 year and trading away your assets. JV, Poetl, Demar were and still good players. Correct me if I'm wrong but the only players in 2019 that were ""drafted"" by the Raptors were VanVleet, Siakam and Powell  Understand that I'm not saying that every team needs to win a ring w/ players they drafted. But I do appreciate teams that get their players legitimately. AKA Kyle was a fair trade at the time, probably closer to a steal of a trade but it was still a GM making moves.   I never said ""drafting your team is the only true ring"", I am saying I appreciate the original Golden State ring a million times more then the KD bullshit one because I do not have respect for a Top 3 player in the league taking a paycut to join the very team that eliminated him from the WCF and already had a ring.   Nothing you can say will change my mind that that move was a pussy move on KD's part."
"No. At 21 ppg, it‚Äôs entirely possible that he may not be the leading scoring on his team. Jamal Murray is close to 21 ppg, but Jokic is the MVP candidate. Middleton is averaging more ppg, yet Giannis is the MVP candidate . Tobias Harris is around 21 ppg, yet Embiid is the MVP candidate.   The player you described could possibly be DeAngelo Russell. If the T‚Äôwolves were 52-30, KAT would be the MVP candidate.   Or it could be Malcolm Brogdon. If the pacers were 52-30, how many people would say it was because of Sabonis?  When the Raptors were a top seed... Kyle Lowry didn‚Äôt get much consideration as an MVP candidate. They looked toward Derozen/Leonard/Siakim as the MVP candidates.   Your player would need to do more...essentially they would HAVE to win the conference with inferior talent... aka CP3 with the hornets, Derrick Rose with the Bulls, Iverson with the 76ers, etc."
"There was no ""Lowry trade"".  You have be a weeks-old Laker fan not to know that every team in the league constantly uses the Lakers for leverage.  This has been going on for decades, at least.  Whenever a team is underwhelmed by trade offers, they leak a rumor that the Lakers are considering some nonsensical offer for said player.  The Lakers were never going to trade their entire backcourt for a few weeks of Kyle Lowry -- even Pelinka isn't that stupid."
"No I actually had no idea that the owner of the team is the one who hired the president of basketball operation so thanks for that. Jesus fucking Christ.  What you actually said was that ‚ÄúBrO DOlAN NeEdS To StOp COntRoLlinG LiTeRaLLy EvErYThIng BruH.‚Äù.... which hasn‚Äôt been in the case in years. He hired Phil Jackson and stayed out of the way and Phil was an utter disaster so he fired him a few years later. He brought back Steve Mills and stayed out of the way and Mills was (predictably) an utter disaster so he fired a couple years later. Now he hired Leon Rose and has stayed out of the way and things are looking good so he won‚Äôt be fired as long as this keeps up.   The last time he intervened in a basketball decision was when he nixed the Kyle Lowry trade during the 2013-2014 season, a terrible decision as always.  But yeah you‚Äôre right, James D is making all the basketball decisions nowadays and also RJ Barrett is just a fringe starter, maybe. You definitely seem to be well versed in the state of the Knicks right now lmao."
"Im saying its half assed if you keep overpaying players who arent close to sure things. Paying Randle worked out. Paying someone who is frequently injured and somewhat inconsistent $25m is imo a half assed attempt at a rebuild. I understand yall have the cap space for another star but that $5+m that could have gone to rounding out your roster. If you pay him $18-20m and we dont match so be it. And yall missed out on a shit ton of stuff at the trade deadline. 2021 FA class is pretty meh since you arent getting kawhi. CP3, spencer dinwiddie and Kyle Lowry so ironically its probably the most options for signing a PG, maybe theyd have to be overpaid to idk."
Kyle Lowry is not staying just to remain on a lottery team for the rest of productive career. You guys are selling yourself a dream.
What about the next 2 years? Lowry would sign in Philly if we traded him now we will likely keep him and I would rather have 2 more years with Kyle than philly having him for 2 years and we get Maxey.
Kyle Lowrys value definitely dropped after this trade deadline passed  Masai definitely is over valuing him and in the offseason we'll see the true value.  I see Lowry signing to a contender for the 10mil/yr range for 2 years.   Those big offers wont be there
"Once again r/nba massively undervalues Kyle Lowry, look what the suns  just gave up for chris paul."
"Because he brought in every single piece on that team lol. What more could a gm possibly do? He found Siakam, OG, FVV, Powell and Jonas. He traded Demar (who he also found) for Kawhi Leonard. He traded JV for Marc Gasol. He traded for Serge Ibaka. He got Kyle Lowry before he hit his prime.  That roster was probably the least lucky roster in the last 10 years to win a championship. They didn't get their guys through free agency or have lottery luck, hell none of those guys were even top picks."
"Right, but he would've been replaced in the rotation by Kyle Lowry."
kyle lowry
Kyle Lowry is a 6x all star
"I‚Äôd assume most people would call Kyle Lowry a star, or at least I would. Siakam even, though to a lesser degree, was a star then, or at least he was becoming a star at that point in his career."
Half a season of 35 year old Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt worth it
"Tony Parker, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving"
"I was trying to look this up, too, and couldn't find a satisfactory answer.  The ref was looking right at his foot too, so she must have been fine with it, and I don't see it mentioned anywhere.  I guess I'll just wait until Kyle Lowry inbounds the ball late with his toe on the line and if the refs call it."
"Every time Westbrook gets criticized, his fans whine about ""analytics ruining the game.""  Analytics aside. Have you ever played a lot with a really ball-dominant guard? When they're great it works, but if they're anything less than great, everybody else is just kind of standing around and not getting into the flow of things. There's a reason Dipo/Grant/Sabonis didn't take their leaps playing with Russ, and it's not all random chance. Russ gets assists, but he doesn't maximize the players he plays with, and the fact that they didn't get a chance to develop should be more of a knock against him than it is.   Imagine the OKC team from his MVP year with say, Kyle Lowry at the helm. Lowry wouldn't have averaged a triple double, but I'd bet that Dipo/Sabonis/Grant all would have looked better and the team would have been just about as good then and would be better now."
"I have never once said that, nor do I think that. I just said Chris Paul is a better player. That doesn‚Äôt mean I think Kyle Lowry is bad, I personally wanted him at the trade deadline on the 76ers."
Kyle Lowry slapping that one equipment manager's ass in the bubble
"Kyle Lowry was an anomaly, he isnt the normal."
Kyle Lowry averaged 9 on really bad efficiency and started 0 games as a 23 year old.
Kyle lowry gets carried to a championship after years of choking and people act like he is the next cp3. He is 36 next year and we have seen how steep the decline gets with older players just look at cp3 an all time great point guard and his clear decline between 2018 and 2019. No only are you loosing three players you have to sign lowry to a two year 20+ contract to keep him or you traded for nothing and then expect a 36 year old point guard whose current most prominent ability is falling to help you keep one of the best defenses in the league. How many players are actually contributing at kyle lowry age not many at all
Kyle Lowry a recent Champion &amp; 6-time Allstar price was too high for these pussy ass teams that never won anything and don't know how to win price was too high but Juru Holiday 3 1st round picks no ring no Allstar appearances
"Doesn't take as much energy as I acknowledge that he's an inefficient player who's never done anything without a significantly better player carrying him. You sure seem to be devoting a lot of energy to defending him.   Calling him a HOF PG isn't really saying much, you guys think Kyle Lowry should be in there too, lol."
"Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry is overrated
"Lol you‚Äôre just mad i‚Äôm right.  News Flash: Raps are 11th in the conference, so continue adding to my point that they should have dealt there players for young assets, and begin the new era (all while still in 2nd place) completely and fully knowing that there was no chance at a repeat in the first place, LMFAO.  Get young assets in playoff situations early in their career with an already blossoming young squad is the dream. Not holding onto Vets and watching them leave for zilch.  Are you seriously gonna attempt to even justify that you would rather watch Kyle Lowry walk, instead of having Tyrese Maxey ? Duncan Robinson ?  Holy Moly"
As if they aren‚Äôt already. If AD is healthy they are still the favorites. Without AD kyle Lowry is irrelevant.
"&gt;""you're not getting the full Kyle Lowry experience. That's Lebron's team, Lebron's gonna have the ball. Kyle Lowry has the ball, Kyle Lowry's had the ball for the last decade. He's not the...just throw him off the ball""  This is just objectively a bad take. Lowry has a Lowry usage and time of possession this year then Schroder. He's been sharing the ball with Van Vleet, Siakam, Kawhi, Derozan, etc. for years. Vernon seems to think he's a ball dominant player and he's not."
"Kyle is an overrated midget , these GMs are smart guys that make millions. They know this about Lowry."
"Except, Morey just publicly showed Kyle what he thinks Lowry is worth.  Kyle will take that personally. He even said as much last night"
"What planet are you living on?  LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, Giannis, Harden and Kyle Lowry  Not even a question"
"Lowry is also still a Raptor, lol.  It is imo likely that Kyle signs another deal in Toronto either in a sign and trade in the off-season or as another trade chip for Masai to flip next trade deadline.  Acting like Kyle is just gonna walk to the Lakers in the off-season is pretty hilarious."
I read/heard that Masai did admit they had a (rightfully) biased view on what the value of Kyle Lowry is. I'm not surprised they didn't ship him out without a haul in return.
"imo there are only a couple of superstar point guards. To me a superstar is a top 10 player. I mean, Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt even an all star this year"
"Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Ben Simmons"
Like who? His size and rebounding puts him over the top for me. Please do not say Kyle Lowry.
"Kyle Lowry best floor general in the league üòÇ ....  Chris Paul  Harden  Lebron  enters the room and beats you dead they dont even hide your body, they want it to serve as a warning to everyone else"
Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry in shambles
"If you don't get Kyle, you should keep Danny.  Tbh having Danny in the locker room was huge for us during the play-offs along with Serge and Kawhi especially after going down 0-2 to MKE. If you're going to make a deep play-off run, you're going to need calming guys with Championship pedigree like Danny, and to some extent Dwight.  If you do manage to get our boy, he's going to offer a lot of leadership and intangible assets like that as well, those charges Lowry takes that I know you guys love to hate will swing games in your favor in the play-offs."
If raptors grab him kyle stays and we push for another championship.   If he goes elsewhere lowry is likely to be traded.
"Win win, we get to see him ball in Tampa and we get Kyle fkn Lowry"
"r/nba is filled with people who want to tell black people to suck it up when they face racist treatment and be able to give fake apologies two years later when the heat dies down. He needed your support when it went down. Not now. If Kyle Lowry had enough balls to stand up for him, why didn‚Äôt you?"
"Franchise icon¬†[Kyle Lowry](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/160)¬†remains committed to the¬†[Toronto Raptors](https://www.thescore.com/nba/teams/5), according to his agent Mark Bartelstein. Bartelstein denied rumors Thursday about Lowry's desire to land with the¬†[Philadelphia 76ers](https://www.thescore.com/nba/teams/4)¬†if he ends up getting dealt by Toronto ahead of the March 25 trade deadline. ""There was a story about how he's pushing to go to Philadelphia, that's just not true,"" Bartelstein said during an appearance on¬†[Sirius XM Radio](https://twitter.com/SiriusXMNBA/status/1365081173500850184). ""I had to get on the phone with Masai (Ujiri) and Bobby (Webster) and make sure they knew that that certainly wasn't coming from us.""  Lowry, whose current contract expires this offseason, is averaging 18 points and 6.5 assists per game while shooting 39.5% from long range. The floor general is focused on helping the Raptors ""climb the standings in the East"" as the season progresses, added Bartelstein. An earlier¬†[report](https://www.thescore.com/news/2121691)¬†linked Lowry to the 76ers, while also naming the Los Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat as potential suitors."
Damn he‚Äôs so close to my birthday it makes me pretty upset. 1000000 of me aren‚Äôt worth one Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry is an expiring contract who isn't an orbit shifting superstar like AD or Kawhi. I am not sure what you think Kyle is expected to net you.
I don't know who is downvoting but I'm guessing they wouldn't trade Kyle Lowry for Maxey either.
It‚Äôs not just assets. Philly is primed for a run. I just don‚Äôt see how Lowry fits with Ben. Need shooters around Kyle
He‚Äôs not worth Kyle Lowry lol
He‚Äôs a rookie and he‚Äôs shown to have a lot of potential while Kyle Lowry is 34 years old and doesn‚Äôt have many good years left
A rookie with scoring potential. He won‚Äôt do anything in the playoffs. You know fans love rookies that show potential.  He‚Äôs definitely tradable for Kyle Lowry.
"Kyle Lowry, and I think you all know why"
The thing is Kyle Lowry is probably the most absolutely annoying player in the world to play against. But you'd kill to have him on your side
"&gt;Sure but if Kyle has already told them privately that he's not gonna re-sign  They're talking about moving him because keeping him closes their window (as weird as that sounds).  Keeping Lowry means being in *""win-now""* mode, when the Raptors are in *""young building team""* mode.  They're retooling around FVV/Siakam/OG/Norm, and part of that is moving Lowry for picks/prospects and using the cap space to sign a free agent or two."
"They‚Äôre in the minority on our sub lol. Lowry is exactly what we need to fill our main weakness and reportedly if he left you guys he wants to come back home. Daryl really likes him too, wouldn‚Äôt like to trade Maxi, I‚Äôd rather trade a future 1st but it‚Äôs gonna be salary filler (Danny, Scott/Ferguson/poirier/etc, and a 1st/Maxey and maybe future second). Also dunno if Toronto would want to move him if they stay in that 4-6 range but he may walk for nothing in the summer. Would love to get his bird rights though and have him finish his career back home, he‚Äôs already forever a legend in Toronto. Plz come home Kyle"
Or Kyle Lowry
"He would be well well below Precious/Maxey and any trade with the Clippers returns 0 first rounders and requires salary commitments beyond this year.  Lol you don't know Kyle Lowry at all if you think he's taking a vet min, he can get 20M a year from whoever on the market next year.  Anyways you guys have no shot, not wasting any more time replying."
"Wut? If Kyle Lowry is on the market, there are plenty of teams want him. Raptors are not trading him for scraps."

I think Danny might have more defensive versatility but Lowry is the better defender.  Danny is more error prone on D and Kyle is more dedicated to strong active defense.
i will unalive myself if kyle lowry ever wears a clippers jersey
The next Kyle Lowry in every way
"Yes but in the same vein, popularity doesn‚Äôt correlate to greatness. You bring up players like Magic not getting their due now because of younger fans, but what about players like Elgin Baylor who came before Magic? some OLD OLD heads would argue he was even better. I look at Vince carter like a high light reel that‚Äôs fun to watch in passing but never made me feel anything for basketball; Just him. When I watched Lowry become the player he has over the last 7 years I really fell in love with the game of basketball and all it‚Äôs nuances. I guess it‚Äôs all a matter of when you watched the game but VC never made the connection to me like Demar and Kyle did"
"Sixers get: Kyle Lowry  Raptors get: Nothing  Yea, sure"
Who‚Äôs going to win:  Lowry/Tobias/Simmons/Embiid  Harden/Kyrie/KD  Anybody saying the Sixers is having a laugh. It‚Äôs the Nets world. Kyle Lowry won‚Äôt save you.
"I respect how you're viewing your team right now a lot.  I think ""I like my team and the players on it"" is a fine reason not to want to trade them.  But I feel like people are falling way too in love with the idea of Maxey's future saying they wouldn't trade him for still very good Kyle Lowry."
"Re sign and resign, sorry I didn‚Äôt know 40 year old grammar nazi‚Äôs were that critical on a meaningless conversation about Kyle Lowry on the Sixers."
Kyle Lowry on half a year expiring is worth what those players make

"Kyle lowry waiting in his taking a charge postion  To be serious it would definitely be a silhouette of a Vince Dunk, or the side view of the kawhi game winner. you would probably have to wait for him to retire for that though."
It‚Äôs the East. So has Kyle Lowry and he‚Äôs made 1 3rd team all nba
"&gt;20yo Rose  Who just won MVP on a team with the best record that year  &gt;Al Horford, Jeff Teague  Who were all stars and led their team to the best record in the East  &gt;Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry  Again, best record in the East and both All Stars.  Fortunately you don't win a championship by being the best team in your conference, you win it by beating the best team in the other conference which Lebron did 3 times in the East.   You are a grade A nonce"
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
Kyle Lowry taking a charge.
"it could be that when you compare a normal amount of complaining to what Kyle Lowry does every night, it seems like nothing."
I love Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Does anyone know if Kyle Lowry is a spot up shooter or nah?
Kyle. Fucking. Lowry.
"&gt; what year are you talking about?   In 2016.  29-6-8 on 60% TS and he missed all 3 all-nba teams.   And keep in mind those numbers were even more impressive back then.   Klay Thompson finished on 3rd team with 22-4-2 on 57%TS lol.  Kyle Lowry finished ahead of him with 21-5-6. He had a great argument to be 1st team all-nba.  No one with anything CLOSE to those numbers have ever missed all-nba teams.     &gt;  there's some weird stuff that goes on with all nba and all defensive teams. several dpoy's have missed defensive first team  There's some weird stuff that happens with defensive awards, not all-nba and MVP.  And that's because defense is extremely hard to measure."
"Not ""young"" in the sense that they most likely aren't a developing prospect anymore. At 27 you should be more or less a finished product if you have been in the NBA for your whole career up to that point.  There are rare exceptions like Steve Nash, Kyle Lowry, and Paul Millsap who made huge leaps in their late 20s/early 30s."
Damn I thought I hated Kyle lowry and the raps but that vid was whloesome as fuck. Kinda like the dude now lol
After watching Kyle Lowry try to draw charges in the game last year I don‚Äôt even know how it can be an argument. No one wants to see that
"bro he's bad, but we also have kyle lowry on our team who is probably some player's worst nightmare on a switch.  and neither of them are anywhere close to marcus smart."

Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"I think Malone hurts his case by wearing a different uniform at the end of his career, non-basketball things aside. Stockton was a Jazz man to the very bitter end and the fact that the only other jersey you‚Äôll ever see pictures of him in being Team USA is pretty important to the conversation. Loyalty is huge to a team‚Äôs history. Look at Lowry and Russ. You could pretty easily argue Vince or Kawhi over Kyle, and then KD over Russ, but would fans of their teams ever say that? Hell no."
"Great write-up.   Like you said, I can't see Kyle Lowry being traded anymore after the Raptors' recent surge. The only way it'd happen is if he requests it or a team offers a ridiculous package."
"&gt; Plays like Young's brake-check jumper have created a lot of conversation within the league. But there are so many clever maneuvers players use. Some are so subtle to the point of being nearly unnoticeable, like Kyle Lowry setting up to take a charge and gently pulling the offensive player into him to make it look like he got plowed over. &gt;  &gt; McCutchen has a polite name for these players: innovators. He won't name names, though NBA fans know the prime culprits and the strategies they deploy. &gt;  &gt; ""Innovators, such as some of the players you may be imagining,"" McCutchen said, ""are always going to test the rules."" &gt;  &gt; A good example: The rulebook is clear about two steps after a gather. But what it doesn't say is that the steps have to be forward, backward or sideways. Players such as James Harden, Jayson Tatum and others have, ahem, innovated to take that step-back to extremes.  There's a significant difference between taking advantage of the rules (like the swipe through, before the league changed the rule) and deceiving the ref (Lowry pulling players onto him).  The former is on the league to stop, while the latter is on the refs."
"When asking who's the GOAT, it's not just who is the best player, that's why you have Kyle Lowry being the GOAT over Hakeem and Kawhi, it's a mixture of popularity, skill and off court stuff"
Chris Paul -&gt; thicc  Kyle Lowry -&gt; thicc  Kemba -&gt; not thicc  I think that's the most simplified answer.
Bruh we can't help who's on the schedule. Stop hating on us we the only team who has a praying hope of beating Brooklyn in the East. Give us Kyle Lowry and we really can make a run.  Instead of downing us support us. We all we got! Brooklyn we coming!
"Danny Green for Kyle Lowry trade should happen ASAP, Danny was making big plays for the Raps down the stretch while Kyle did nothing tonight  On a serious note, can‚Äôt believe we won this game and took the season series against Toronto, I swear games agains them are never enjoyable tho for me even if we win"
My point is KP is much more valuable than Lowry at this point. Yes KP leaves a lot to desire but think of Kyle Lowry at 25. No where near the player he ended up being in his prime. I say give him time and let the contract play out
He can be Kyle Lowry! I keep saying that! He is going to be a huge part of this team.
"Kyle Lowry didn‚Äôt make his first team till he was 28. Lonzos not gonna be some perennial 8 time all star, but the dudes still on his rookie contract and has shown at his peak he can be a 20-22/8/8 guy with great defense which could be enough to get a couple."
&gt;but the player you described is literally Lowry  That's a disservice to Kyle Lowry.  I'm talking about a player who can only do the things I listed more or less.  Lowry can do a lot more than the player I described.
"never forget that kyle lowry putback dunked on melo, his own teammate in an all star game"
Kyle Lowry in shambles
kyle lowry is forced to participate
What would the Sixers realistically have to give up to bring in Kyle Lowry?
"Rozier was solid for the 16th pick but only became a good player once he left. It‚Äôs like Kyle Lowry, even though the Grizzlies drafted him it‚Äôs not considered a great pick for them because he started to shine somewhere else  Rob Williams is good I guess but he passed on Graham,Robinson,Brunson,Spellman and GTJ who were all selected within the next 9 picks"
"Kyle Lowry pushes them up into serious contention  Tatum and Brown aren‚Äôt the problem, but as a team, they need more guys who‚Äôs first offensive instinct isn‚Äôt ‚Äúlemme get me a bucket‚Äù  Their real problem is just a ton of bad players getting big minutes in their rotation, plain and simple"
Fr ü§£ 25 year old potential all star for washed 34 Kyle Lowry
Peak didn‚Äôt update their US website for 5 years...  and Lowry was able to go right back to Adidas after the peak thing.  Lowry called his time with them ‚Äústupid‚Äù lol  https://theundefeated.com/features/raptors-guard-kyle-lowry-every-sneaker-worn-nba-all-star/
Kyle Lowry  Doug Christie  Vince Carter  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam
"Over the last 4 years, both my parents started watching the Raptors games with me.   They now watch every game and even understand all the rules, and can even call out bad referee calls.  My mom particularly, would most likely die for Kyle Lowry if it came to it."
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Vince Carter  SF: Tracy McGrady (or DeMar DeRozan, if we're only taking the Raptors version of the player)  PF: Kawhi Leonard  C: Chris Bosh"
Give us kyle lowry Boucher and a 1st
Yeah Kyle Lowry will be way better for both the team chemistry and the teams ultimate championship odds over they scrub James harden. Good thing philly let him go somewhere else. Probably won‚Äôt have to think about it for  a while
Kyle Lowry plays*   *for his hometown Philadelphia 76ers when he‚Äôs traded tonight and proceeds to bring them a championship blessed big butted king
"It was a thank you contract, but it was also probably them hedging their bets too on him  As much as he's the franchise player, you don't want to get stuck paying 35 year old Kyle Lowry a multi year contract and risk him finally regressing with age."
For my mental health I need the lakers to trade for Kyle Lowry
"I don't think he's obviously better than Fred so I gave the nod to FVV since he's played in 6 more games than Lowry, and led the Raptors to wins in all 6 of those games that Kyle has missed too"
Well yeah not for a James Harden. For Kyle Lowry absolutely.
"Imagine you're the GM of the Bucks or 76ers.  Holiday and Lowry cost the same package in assets.  You're worried about re-signing both of them in the offseason.  You can have a 31 year old Jrue Holiday who has played 67 and 61 games the last two seasons for 33M X 3 years + player option.   or   You can have a 35 yr old Kyle Lowry 58 and 65 games who wants 20M X 3 years + a Team Option  Which would your rather have?  Lowry is likely to decline faster, but he's also going to be cheaper and it will probably be a team option in the last year.  Younger guys cost more.  Jrue will be more expensive and he's not as good as Lowry but he will probably decline slower.   Second question, if both signed 3 year deals, which one do you expect to play more games over the course of three years?"
"Raptor fans want to trade Lowry for anything, even a 7th SG for our roster while sitting here all season complaining that Matt Thomas doesn't get minutes.     To avoid losing him for ""nothing"" but honestly, if you make this trade you're telling Norm he isn't being extended and you're going to lose him for nothing so we would probably have to follow up by trading Norman Powell elsewhere.     Then you just lost Kyle Lowry and Norman Powell for Tyrone Maxey.     Doubtful."
He wasn‚Äôt even the worst selection that year lol that was Kyle Lowry who averaged 14ppg on horrible efficiency.
"....who the fuck was even talking about Kyle Lowry? Take your raptor boner and go bother somebody else, dude. Kyle Lowry is egregiously over paid and he‚Äôs being grossly outplayed by scrubs like VanVleet. Get the fuck outta here with that shit."
Learning from Kyle before he takes over. Lowry pace is much better and less of a hog. But fvv can run the point
Kyle Lowry  Joe Harris  OG Anunoby  Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
"It‚Äôs not really slander. I‚Äôm telling the truth. He underperforms in the biggest games, tier 1 players dominate in big games.  And winning a ring with KD and Kyrie as your teammates means a whole lot less than winning a ring with Kyle Lowry and pascal siakam. Or klay and dray. Or Kyrie and Kevin love."
"Yeah.  I'm a big Kyle Lowry fan, and I'd honestly rather see him walk in free agency than for us to give him to the 6ers for something that doesn't make us better right now."
"How am i moving the goal post?   &amp;#x200B;  When i said ""not like he was even playing"" it was a statement that goran missed a lot of games and more than lowry. it wasnt a definitive statement in ""GORAN PERCIECLY MISSED 13 GAMES WHILE KYLE LOWRY MISSED 6"". You said the heat wont trade him because he has been incredible for him, I said lowrys still the better player and would be an upgrade. There are 2 points being discussed, 1 the missed games 2. the stats and who the better player is.   &amp;#x200B;  Also why do you always say ""youre moving the goalpost"" when I had 2 very valid points throughout our discussion."
"&gt; KD has probably the best shot selection in the league other than Kawhi.  I wouldn't say they have great shot selection, I'd say that they both are excellent bad shot makers. They make bad, low efficiency shots really, really well. That bodes well for late game playoff situations where it's harder to generate offense and the game becomes ISO ball/mismatch hunting because teams want to reduce turnovers and put the ball in their best players hands to make a play. But you don't want to run your offense for a full 48 minute game like that.   The best shots are still the ones at the rim, Harden can get to the rim whenever he wants to. KD *used* to be able to do that, unsure of whether he can anymore after the injury.   &gt; don't compare either of KD or Harden to Dame and CJ ever again please.  You're missing the point, it's about different roles.   Engine of the Offense - This is Harden's role and he's probably the 2nd best player in the league at it behind LeBron. This role is about playmaking, running the offense, most of these guys average 8 assists per game or more, but they can also score when they need to, they're dual threats. Jokic is elite at this too, so is Dame, and then the 2 next gen guys who are elite are Trae, who is basically discount Dame, and Luka, who is basically discount Harden. Russ used to be great in this kind of role when he played smart. Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley were all great at this, all of them aren't able to carry that kind of load anymore, which is why they are sliding into a lesser role in order to let Booker, Mitchell, VanVleet attempt to take on this kind of responsibility. But this kind of player is whom you need to run your offense over the course of a 48 minute game.   Kawhi has taken on in this kind of role on the Clippers, although you can argue he should be in the latter role as that better suits him, and he's not good enough at this role, he's not elite.  The Drive Line of the Offense - This is KD's role and he's probably the best in the league at it. This role is about shot-making ability, scoring efficiently from all 3 levels of the floor, but most importantly the mid-range and 3-point line, because these are the shots that are taken at the end of games. They are your secondary ball-handlers and generally get around ~5 assists per game. Other great players in this kind of role are Steph, Kyrie, Middleton, Kawhi, PG, CJ, Jamal Murray etc. AD was able to be this for the Lakers last year.   Any great team needs 1 of each of these type of players in order to win a championship.   The engine of the offense type can do more alone in terms of regular season wins, but has a hard ceiling on it, and will stall out in the playoffs, typically around the 2nd round. The drive line of the offense type is more dependent on the engine of the offense type, but is the player that's necessary to take a team from the 2nd round to the Finals/championship.   Kawhi is a good reference point in this, he took a team with a very good and one of the most underrated engine of the offense type players in Kyle Lowry, a team that perennially made the 2nd round every year, and he was the difference in that team breaking over that barrier and getting to the Finals and winning a championship.   Kawhi is now trying to be the engine of the offense for the Clippers, but they lost in the 2nd round last year, because he's not elite in that role. And because PG wasn't good enough in the Drive Line role. Kawhi is trying to be more like LeBron, when he should go back to trying to be like KD, that's the best use of him. And in order for that to happen, Clippers need an engine of the offense type player."
"I prefer the Yao and T-Mac teams.  Rafer Alston or Kyle Lowry, Brooks, Scola, Artest, Carl Landry, Mutombo, Battier off the bench. That roster was insane."
"As great if a stat that is, Kyle Lowry is still an important piece for us"
"It's not that we're better without Lowry, but there's some sense to this madness if you've really watched Pascal. The team is best with him being a primary playmaker.   There are games where he has 20 pts and 6+ assists, and then down the stretch Kyle/Fred go into dribble around and jack 3s mode."
Kyle Lowry was gifted a ring due to another teams horrible misfortune.
That sucks man. I feel the same whenever we waste a good Kyle Lowry game. Shit just stings more than usual.
Must be tough settling for 6x All-Star Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry has a ring. You guys love putting down ringless players but don't praise him.
"Me when Kyle Lowry foul baits and flops: ""High BBIQ player""  Me when Trae Young foul baits and flops: ""Ugly piece of shit"""
There‚Äôs a million examples of players making drastic improvements in areas of their games after 4+ years of being bad at something.  Kyle Lowry spent 5 years in the 20s% range from deep to becoming an elite shooter.  You‚Äôre claim that no one can drastically improve is  whats bullshit.   Over 130 fgs is not nothing. It shows growth. And the numbers indicate he has improved. On top Indy is known for taking bad average defenders and turning them into good ones.
COTY - Nate Bjorkgren  MIP - Christian Wood  6MOTY - Chris Boucher   ROTY - Tyrese Haliburton   DPOY - Joel Embiid   MVP - I have no clue rn  Philly trades for Kyle Lowry and make it to the Finals but lose to the Lakers in 6 games.
This dude just put Kyle Lowry over Tony Parker lmfao

Can I insert Kyle Lowry into this conversation??
Not if your name is Kyle Lowry
üòã Ohhhh buddy...  kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
&gt; Kyle Lowry is probably the best Raptor to ever step foot in Toronto  &gt;  Dinosaurs in shambles. Literally
Lol then you are severely underestimating Kyle Lowry
"I mean they would have a shot but would still be underdogs  They would have to convince the Sixers to trade Kyle Lowry for Danny Green Mike Scott matching salary and two protected firsts. Raptors fans wont like seeing that proposal, honestly I bet some Sixers fans wont like giving up two future firsts for Lowry either."
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
"I think Kyle Lowry will be remembered in NBA history, and has made himself part of the league's narrative, but he is not a HOFer"
"It's possible that's been a recent trend. But look at guys like Steph, Kemba, Mike Conley, Kyle Lowry, Dragic, Schroder. It took those guys like ~5-6 years to become the player they would eventually mature into vs guys like Jokic, Embiid, Drummond, Bam who were already very effective players 2-3 years in. I think you're right the gap has closed over time tho because back in the day you had more examples of this with guys like Nash, Payton, Billups taking much longer than their big man counterparts."
Not first ballot but Kyle Lowry is a HoF. He is the Greatest Raptor ever and means a lot to Toronto and Canadian sports fans. He'll get there eventually
So you're saying Kyle Lowry is the bare minimum in terms of what you would consider a HOF player? Just asking for clarification.
&gt; Kyle Lowry is probably the best Raptor to ever step foot in Toronto   Kawhi????
"The hall of fame is not just about skill, but also the significance of the player. Kyle Lowry is probably the best Raptor to ever step foot in Toronto, not only for his skill, but for what he's done for the franchise."
I‚Äôm looking at the top guys that are going to get dealt is....  1. Kyle Lowry  2. DeMar DeRozan  3. Andre Drummond  4. John Collins  5. Victor Oladipo
"I am teasing him, in good faith. I thought his comment was hilarious. James harden ain‚Äôt my type though, I‚Äôm more of a Kyle lowry man myself"
"1. Playing in Tampa Bay, away from home. It's essentially 72 road games this year.  2. No playable center, meaning there's no rim protection or scoring in the paint.  3. No serviceable bench rotation: Raptors play great in the 1st and 4th quarters, but are one of the worst teams in the 2nd and 3rd quarters.  4. Unable to close out games (6 of 8 losses were decided on final possessions).  5. Following up that last point, half court offense is still a problem from last season.  Basically, the Raptors need a scoring wing,, a center and some depth for the bench. I imagine the FO trades Kyle Lowry for assets and the team reloads through the draft and free agency."
Shooting Forward: Malik Beasley  Small Guard: Isaiah Thomas  Power Guard: Kyle Lowry
I have a feeling that Morey will swing an important deal. I‚Äôve been always looking at Kyle Lowry.   He‚Äôs on an expiring contract so he won‚Äôt be expensive. He‚Äôs popular in Philly. He‚Äôs a winner and a leader that Philly doesn‚Äôt currently have. Plus he‚Äôs a guy that can create his own shot that Philly really lacks. I think he‚Äôs a better fit for them then Harden was with what they was going to give up factored in.
So my Sixers can steal Kyle Lowry at the deadline üòà
Kyle Lowry?
Kyle Lowry for Kyrie straight up
You're taking this really personally lmao. Kyrie is the better player than Kyle Lowry. I know it hurts to hear.
He got a big booty so I call him Kyle Lowry
https://sports.yahoo.com/kyle-lowry-scores-zero-points-raptors-game-1-loss-magic-005446231.html
"Man...........  Never underestimate Tillman's pettiness, ""I need all of Simmons Thybulle Maxey and every unprotected pick you have otherwise Im taking this junk from the Nets. Watch me"".   For Philly this sucks but im still honestly surprised nobody else in the NBA was willing to match or beat this offer. Petty Tillman wouldnt be giving Harden his preference of going to BK if he could have avoided it.  Next fake trade target for Philly: Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry too maybe
Yeah Maxey is reserved for the Kyle Lowry trade
If Kyrie is a hall of famer I really need to reassess what HoF even means...was he ever better than a top 15 player in the NBA?   Is Lillard a HoF? Because he's had a much better career. What about Kyle Lowry? Hell I think Mike Conley's had a better career and he never even made an all-star team...
"Because there are lots of players who genuinely don't give a fuck about what fans say and enjoy their 100+ million earnings. Kawhi, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, Harden, Anthony Davis (who went through actual hell with the pelicans) are all examples of this. There are really only a select few players that can't get off social media and filter out the noise; generational wealth and thick skin has a tendency to do that.  KD, Kyrie, Lebron at times, Wall, Jordan back in the day, are the exceptions, not the rule."
Never forget rockets legend Kyle Lowry
"Curt's not really a good example, but if you're looking for NBA late bloomers, Kyle Lowry didn't make an All-Star game until he was 28, Rodman didn't even enter the *league* until 25, and Steve Nash didn't reach MVP-level until his 30s."
"Kyle Lowry, Matt Thomas, McCaw for Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Tyrese Maxey"
That Raptors team was better than lots of Thunder teams in the past. He had Kyle Lowry and Siakam along with great role players. Durant was leading the league in scoring every year with no spacing and brought the youngest team in the league to the Finals. I wouldn‚Äôt say KDs job was easier other than those 3 GSW years.
Sometimes you get the wild one that thinks a pasta is genuine. It happened with kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter during the Warriors game on Sunday lmfao
That‚Äôs Kyle Lowry/James Harden/Trae Young‚Äôs music!
James Harden with the Kyle Lowry backside.
Danny Green  Kyle Lowry  Joel Embiid   Tobias Harris   Boban Marjanovic
Kyle Lowry for Dotson
"But hey we should TANK, like yes Sir what about Kyle Lowry over the last 7 years has shown you he‚Äôs willing to tank? What has shown you FVV is happy to be a tank commander either?   The guys on the team can feel us turning a corner very very soon, Klow has said it publicly. It‚Äôs coming"
steve nash and kyle lowry
Kyle Lowry
"I did the research and you are the one with questions. I have the answers. What are yours?   Did Blake Griffin or Anthony Davis fill in for a starter? That would be my first question to you.  edit: Demar DeRozen and Kyle Lowry deserved it more, too."
"&gt; Lowry has always had off games here and there  I remember the streakiness, both Kyle and DeMar. I guess that contributed to the ""Trash Bros"" nickname (always hated it). I feel like he's become more composed even if he's inconsistent ever since the championship run, which I like to see. Hopefully Father Time catches up w/ him later rather than sooner... in terms of longevity/durability, he's kinda like the Lebron of PGs. But you guys will definitely need a replacement franchise PG in a few years, preferably drafted while Lowry can still teach him. (Unless you're gonna let Lowry walk, or he leaves.)"
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"I know you guys love him, but you can't keep him *and* get a free agent next year, he probably [won't be elite past another season or two](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/kyle-lowry/), and the assets you would get back would be critical to the next contention window."
"Our GM is Bobby Webster, Masai is the President of Basketball Operations. And our star/best player is still Kyle Lowry, not Pascal or FVV.  The buck stops with Masai Ujiri though, man is arguably the best Exec in the league and has been for years."
Craziest part is it was looking like a blowout until Kyle Lowry tried to TMac us.
Someone said Kyle Lowry is Raymond Felton with cheeseüò≠
*Kyle Lowry
"Kyle Lowry, Vanvleet, Siakam, and OG?  If you are good enough to get a  double digit lead, you are good enough to close the deal with better coaching"
"Players can become better players after 26 (which is what Siakam's age is) There's a reason Kyle Lowry is the GOAT Raptor and it ain't for what he did before the age of 26 lmao. OG is young, Freddy is also 26. Most of our players outside of Lowry and if you can consider him a player Baynes are relatively inexperienced in being a big piece on a contending team. Winning is tough and it takes a lot of growth as a team, which is something they will be learning this year. Real basketball isn't 2k where players plateau and start declining at 26 lmao."
"It's hard to think of Nick Nurse, FVV, Kyle Lowry and Siakam on a tanking team."

How do you feel about the Kyle Lowry content
Not top 25 and after that who gives a shit.  Active point guards that are better  - Chris Paul - Kyle Lowry - Russell Westbrook - Damian Lillard - Mike Conley (iffy) - Steph Curry - D-Rose  At least that wouldn‚Äôt surprise me If I‚Äôm missing some
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
"I think you linked the wrong video. Yours shows Kyle Lowry fouling Damion Lee, not ripping his arm off."
&gt; No one touched him. Fuking embarrassing  [Kyle Lowry touched him.](https://imgur.com/e299mgi) I guess this is embarrassing though.
"&gt; Lowry changed the flow with his fouls and FT and that deep 3 heat check. Came in after a bad 3 quarters and just took charge.  Apparently Fred told him to wake the fuck up going into the 4th. Kyle missed the last game due to ""personal reasons"". It may have been something to do with DeMar and his sick dad but no one knows."
kyle lowry is thick and he makes me hard
Imagine thinking Kyle Lowry had no basketball IQ lol. If raps blow it up this year he‚Äôll be wanted by every team in the league.
"Why did the Raptors become way worse after losing Kawhi, as well as 3 other (at least part-time) starters in Danny Green, Marc Gasol, and Serge Ibaka, while their new best player in Kyle Lowry aged 2 years and is now 34???"
Bruh...  Where‚Äôs Kyle Lowry on ur list?
"If he wants to stay, Id want to as well. Once we get Cade itll be really important to have vet like Lowry to mentor him. But, I think Kyle might not be interested in that and will want to go join a contender."
Kyle Lowry for Goofy and Pluto
"Every Raptor fan should be ok with either outcome if they really support Kyle. He'll immediately raise the ceiling of any contender with elite playmaking, excellent defence, and can score when necessary, and. A player like Lowry deserves multiple runs at a championship."
Kyle Lowry for Tilman Fertitta
Wait...coming from a Craptors fan with Kyle Lowry? Yikes
‚ÄúBailed‚Äù lol did u watch Kyle Lowry this game?
Bruh no team that has Kyle Lowry on it will ever have the right to complain about ticky tack calls
Kyle Lowry is a 34 year old man
Foul was on Kyle for slapping Damion Lee‚Äôs arm. Which Lowry did.
"This was the first game of GS I watched this season, god damn I know we got Kyle Lowry, but they had a team of Hardens out there with the flopping"
Kyle Lowry got flopped on. That ain‚Äôt right.
You should see what Kyle Lowry has been doing all game
"Kyle ""FUCK CADE"" Lowry lmao"
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Lmfao that reminds me of Wob's version from the Cs series. He captioned it ""Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart guarding each other"" and both spidermen were on the ground pointing up"
Kyle lowry and steph leading rebounder so far
dunno whos better rod strickland or kyle lowry
Didn't he lock up Kyle Lowry 1v1
He did block Kyle Lowry 1v1 too
Oh you mean Kyle Lowry?
"Kyle Lowry is a HoF. Not first ballot but he's there. The Greatest Raptor ever, NBA Champion, 6x All Star, and means so much to the city and country."
"Gonna guess the players here:  1) &gt;!Mike Miller!&lt;  2) &gt;!Michael Cooper!&lt;  3) &gt;!Rajon Rondo!&lt;  4) Not sure, but gonna guess Dave Bing  5) &gt;!Kyle Lowry!&lt;  Bonus) &gt;!A lot of dudes!&lt;"
"Kyle Lowry is there  He won't make it right away, it will take years  Not enough All NBAs and only all star teams, peaked late  The ring boosted his chances but it's not certain"
That Kyle Lowry thread yesterday was crickets. All ima say
Crazy I didn‚Äôt see y‚Äôall do the same for Kyle Lowry yesterday
This kid reminds me of a Nova Kyle Lowry (when he was the quickest guy on the court).  Guy isn't scared of the moment and plays with such poise for a young fella.
"Kyle Lowry took a personal day too, but /r/nba didn't go in uproar about it  this place is so predictable"
One Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry in shambles.
Steve Simmons future headline: Is Kyle Lowry the problem?
Could be reference to the memes about his tight pants on Twitter. People discovered he has a Kyle Lowry-esque ass
This dude has some weird resemblance to Kyle Lowry
"The Raptors. They're pathetic on multiple levels and will be even worse when Kyle Lowry leaves, after which their ""core"" will be led by Pascal ""Andrew Wiggins 2.0"" Siakam. Every game Lowry plays for the Raptors is a waste of his talent, as was most of Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs tenure there. It's actually sickening how inept and incompetent they are year after year. Five more years of shittery and they should honestly be dissolved and a lottery held to determine where their players will play, leaving only a void of patheticity and depression where once an abominable NBA franchise existed."
Derrick White and Kyle Lowry on the same team?  other teams would get called for a charge on every posession lol
"IDK man. They would have to either give MPJ or Murray. If they give away MPJ, they pretty much loose all wing depth. As for Murray, I don't think they have the guts to trade him, even though they should. More realistically, they should trade for Kyle Lowry."
"What happened was, Haliburton just happened to be walking between Fred and Lowry, as soon as Lowry turned back to Fred to yell something at him. Unfortunately, Haliburton walked between them that very split second, and I'm assuming the ref thought that Kyle was talking shit to Tyrese. Bad call."
Lmao Kyle Lowry having a higher peak than Rose.
Kyle Lowry softer than baby shit
That would not even be enough to get Kyle Lowry let alone Bradley Beal
I agree with this except for 2014. Kyle Lowry was snubbed then and should've made it over Joe Johnson.
Maybe unpopular opinion but I liked the Kyle Lowry/Kevin Martin team (2010 I think?)
"Look at Kyle Lowry, similar caliber of player, got 6 all stars in the east."
Tampa Bay legend Kyle Lowry
I'm still mad that Joe Johnson got the all-star nod over Kyle Lowry in 2013-14.
If he was in the East during his prime he would be Kyle Lowry
Seeing Kyle Lowry fail to keep back a smile as he knew he was heading to the finals  Hooooooohh man... I thought the raps were gonna lose game 6 at one point
"It‚Äôs bullshit to me that Kyle Lowry is a 5 time all star bc he‚Äôs played in the weak East most of his career, but players like Conley and McCollum will never get a nod"
"I tried using the Raptor metric and I got OG  Anunoby, Aron Baynes, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet  Maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong."
kyle Lowry. He could score 0 points in a game and still have the highest plus-minus on the team.
"Kyle Lowry always has a good +\- whole being totally awful at basketball for a reason, worst flopper in the league"
"""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."" - Kyle Lowry, yelling at the refs for not getting a continuation call on a hail-Mary foul-baiting 3 that somehow went in"
"Our best player is Kyle Lowry so I'm gonna say ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone"""
"Something people forget about Andre Drummond...  Kyle Lowry was not always Kyle Lowry. Kawhi was not always Kawhi. Hell, LeBron and Jason Kidd were not the shooters they later became when they were early in their career. It takes time to develop.   How do we know he‚Äôs even THAT bad of a shooter? Granted, his shooting is poor right now, but we‚Äôve seen him take so few shots that we can‚Äôt say for sure that he‚Äôs really any worse than a guy like Giannis."
"I think this guy said Kyle Lowry was better than Westbrook last year, I highly disagree (last season)  But he's on point here"
Kyle Lowry for sure
What if they just tossed the first person who complained and then repeated that for every subsequent complaint from anyone else after that? No dialog regarding disagreements with calls at all. People would stop complaining pretty quickly. If you don't like the call and you are that bent out of shape about it then use your challenge. If not then live with it or get tossed the instant you question anything.  I say this all as a massive Kyle Lowry fan who gets after the refs like crazy too.
Nothing compared to Kyle Lowry
Same. Kyle Lowry is an eyesore
that would be like kyle lowry flopping when he commits the foul
"I mean if you're a team on the brink of contention, but with an aging star(s) (ie, tight window), it would make sense to go all in right now. Kyle Lowry isn't getting any younger. Neither is Jimmy Butler. Most teams that want Beal to push them over the edge don't have the luxury of waiting two seasons. A lot can happen in that time."
"I don't hate VC for how he left, I actually am in favour of retiring his jersey. After our first and second greatest players Lowry and DeRozan. If you knew about the Raptors fanbase and how we feel about VC you'd know that, instead you make it seem like everyone loves the dude when that is not the case. And there are people who don't like Kawhi for talking shit bout the Raptors as he left as well. And no one really cares about Bosh leaving cause the team was absolutely ass and who wouldn't want to leave.  It doesn't matter what VC did, he has been surpassed by Lowry and DeRozan on the greatest Raptors list. Vince Carter said Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time, Masai did, the founder of the Raptors franchise John Bitove did, our announced trio of Devlin/Armstrong/Rautins did, DeMar DeRozan did.  Kyle Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time. Go argue about Jeezy vs Gucci or question why your franchise has been a failure for 70 years or something and let the grown not ignorant not idiotic folks talk."
"Lowry was a top 15 player in the league and if you use impact stats a top 5-10 player in the league through his Raptors career. OK is being a replacement level player, Lowry is a 6 time consecutive All Star and best player on a top team in the conference for his entire run with the team. Tell me, name one other player who has made the All Star team for back to back to back to back to back to back seasons but only played OK? For someone who claims to be a fan of the NBA you sure seem to not know shit bout ball.  Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time because of what he did for the team as a whole. Our greatest run in franchise history starts with him becoming the defacto starting point guard over Jose Calderon, in which he took us from 34-48 &amp; 10th in the East to 48-34 &amp; 3rd in the east, and then never dropping below 4th in the East and 48 wins up until now. He   Oh, and Kobe &amp; KD are not defacto greatest Laker or Thunder. Magic + Russ are also regarded as the GOATs for their respective teams. It isn't basically consensus within their fanbase like it is with Lowry. Oh, and Vince Carter the third greatest Raptor of all time himself has said Kyle Lowry is the greatest Raptor. So even the player you are ignorantly and incorrectly trying to call our franchise GOAT. DeMar DeRozan, the second greatest Raptor said Lowry is the GROAT. Masai Ujiri called him the GROAT. Matt Devlin, Leo Rautins, Jack Armstrong and Sam Mitchell have called Lowry the GROAT. Lowry is the Greatest Raptor Of All Time without a shadow of the doubt.  Being the catalyst, the centrepiece, the engine of the best period of Raptors basketball is greatness. Also, VC is pretty disliked by Raptors fans old enough to have grown up with him due to how he left. To the point of him getting booed for YEARS up until just a few years ago. Even to this day, there are a large amount of Raptor fans who don't think he should have his jersey retired because of how he forced his way out. And there are absolutely people who are currently growing up wanting to play like Lowry and DeRozan. The current generation of kids don't know Vince Carter, he's just some old dude who warmed the bench for the Hawks. They only know and grew up with the Lowry and DeRozan Raptors. So not only do you not know basketball, Raptors history, basic attendence figures but you also don't know how time works."
I‚Äôll give you Isaiah Joe for Kyle Lowry
Nah man Kyle Lowry is better than Allen iverson he‚Äôs so much more efficient cant you see?
"Vince is not making the Hall Of Fame solely on his Raptors career. A Raptors career in which is individual AND team accomplishments have been matched and surpassed by both Lowry and DeRozan. Lowry will most likely eventually make it into the Hall Of Fame seeing he has an 86% HoF probability according to BBRef and all his accomplishments come from his Raptors career, one that has more individual and team accomplishments than Vince Carter. DeMar matches Raptors VC in All NBA's (both have one second and one third) and only one less All Star appearances (4 vs 5) but completely dwarfs Vince Carter in team accomplishments. We actually made it farther in the playoffs with DeMar and Lowry than VC.  Kyle and DeMar never set attendence records you say? Let's compare the highest attendence record for Vince Carter Raptors vs the Lowry and DeRozan Raptors.  Vince Carter 2002. 19,783 average attendence, 4th in the league.  Lowry and DeRozan 2018. 19,839 average attendence, 4th in the league. That is actually the franchise record for average attendence, including the championship season and #RunItBack season.  Lowry and DeRozan have three seasons with a higher average attendence than the highest average Vince Carter's Raptors peaked at.  If you're gonna lie about something, don't make it something easy to debunk like attendence.  Imagine being a Hawks fan trying to lecture a Raptors fan about who our greatest player is (it's Lowry not by an centimetre, but by a kilometre) and where VC ranks (clearly behind DeMar)."
I was just thinking about it and I'm not sure but he'll make it over Kyle Lowry. Although personally I like Lowry better
"You probably look at box score alone. Kyle Lowry is one of the most impactful players of the last decade. He is the definition of a player who is not done justice through stats. He ranks extremely high in advanced Metrics among some of the top players in the league, 7th in the last decade in impact by wins added. Kyrie is an elite scorer, but there is more to winning than simply scoring. Kyrie is not as impactful as Lowry by the eye test, or advanced metrics. Coming from a Spurs fan, there is a reason he has elevated his teams much more than Kyrie has. Jimmy Butler, Lowry, are of that class"
"Duncan Robinson isn't going to the Hall of Fame. Kyle Lowry is already a far better point guard than Kyrie, who let's be honest has no idea how to run an offense."
Literally Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan.
"Yeah it‚Äôs like, I obviously hate Kyle Lowry because he‚Äôs such an avid flopper.. but when Joel flops I don‚Äôt mind so much üòÇ"
Why would the Nets trade Kyrie for Kyle fucking Lowry
"We, as in Toronto?  Couldn't agree more!  Respect given is respect earned, and Kyle Lowry is a person of respect! :)"
"You are obviously a plebian of the highest order. How dare you besmirch Kyle Lowry in favor of a robot. Only an equally decrepit mindset could elucidate such a vapid idealogy.  Why do you think you support the Klaw? In what regard do you identify with him? I may not be a psychologist but it is clear to me you have an underdeveloped operating system that precludes you from seeing beyond the limitations of didactic binary reasoning in favor of actual thinking.   At some point you may graduate beyond the pale imitation for thought you are presently able to conjure. You'll see beyond the singular championship season that was a product of faith and circumstance. And you will look at a big booty badass who was able to bring his franchise from the doldrums of the league to perennial eastern conference powerhouse.    To dismiss such accomplishment reveals an idiocy I shudder to imagine. At some point in this pathetic journey you consider to be a thought process you have not passed even half way around the board.  At this point, it is a fair question if you have even watched NBA ball or if you are some kind of disinfo Russian bot meant to sow dissent in the world through ruining good memories for people on the side who cannot think critically and see the minutiae of context.   Caught in the vagaries of perception you have revealed yourself to have an immaterial sense of reasoning. Rest scared as this sort of voidlessness can only end in emptiness the likes of which your pea brain could never fathom."
"What is with Americans and non Raptors fans telling **US** who are franchises greatest player. It is basically consensus at this point. It is Kyle Terrell Lowry, head and shoulders above everyone else. Kawhi isn't even above DeMar and VC in the greatest Raptors of all time, he played a singular (fantastic) season here and immediately dipped while his camp was dissing our team to our front office talking about Kawhi didn't see us repeating with him, like a Kawhi-less Raptors didn't reach the same point as the Kawhi Clippers, Game 7 of the 2nd round.  What you are doing is confusing best with greatest. LeBron is the best player to put on a Heat uniform, but DWade is the greatest Heat player of all time. Magic Johnson or Kobe depending on who you ask are the greatest Laker of all time, but LeBron is the single best player to ever put on the uniform. Dr. J is the greatest Net of all time, but Durant is the best player to put on a Nets uniform. Kashi is the best player to put on a Raptors uniform, but Lowry is the greatest to ever put on the jersey."
"I tnki you can see it three ways.  Who is the best basketball player who wore raptors jersey then without a doubt Hakeem Olajuwon Who is the player that played the basketball in raptors jersey then it's Kawhi Leonard If you want to find the best player that played multiple season and continuously played the best then you can choose between Chis Bosh, Demar Derozen and Kyle Lowry. I think because Lowry won the title and rest did not, he is the goat torontian."
"Are you really going to say that the guy who didn‚Äôt want to be there and was only there for one year is a greater player for that franchise because he won them a ring? Kyle Lowry (and Demar) has been the heart and soul of Toronto for the better part of a decade, in fact he‚Äôs been there so long that causal fans probably don‚Äôt even remember that he played for Memphis or the rockets before landing in Toronto. If Kyle retires as a raptor I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs going down as the best raptor"
"Kyle Lowry is 34, kyrie is 29, I don‚Äôt the Nets want to get an older player by that much"
My biased opinion? Kyle Lowry can elevate a team by himself. I have never seen Kyrie do that.
 **kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time.**
Kyle Lowry?  Redick?
[serious] Is Kyle Lowry holding the Raptors back?
If this was Kyle Lowry the hate in here would be off the charts
are the Raptors better with Kyle Lowry?
We gon'act like kyle lowry wasn't balling in the finals too?
Nuggets need Kyle Lowry
lmao kyle lowry had to literally tell the raptors fans to stop cheering
"What a stupid take on a guy who's only 24. Go look at what guys like Steve Nash, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Gary Payton, Chauncey Billups, etc. were doing at his age. Dennis Rodman is a HOFer who didn't even touch the court til he was a year older than Mitchell is now."
So what team is going to be the excuse this year? Don't you see Shaq's point now? Either you step up and put up a fight in the second round or you guys really aren't that great when it comes down to it. Shaq used to be hard on Kyle Lowry for the longest time for the same reasons
He might be but again you're not actually debating the subject.  Kyle lowry is not a superstar in 2021. He's maybe a top 30 player right now if we're being real
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"
Kyle Lowry
"No that‚Äôs pretty idiotic, a lot of strategy goes into fouling, an example: if you have fouls to give and you‚Äôre pg winds up in really bad switch down low (think of like Kyle Lowry or Chris Paul getting stuck on the low block against ad who‚Äôs frantically calling for an entry pass) they can foul before the shot and the big doesn‚Äôt get a chance to shoot and the team has to inbound to start the possession again. In your scenario regardless of the foul being before the shot attempt takes place as could just go up and dunk it after being hacked and get a super easy and one"
Lmfao this sub would pick Kyle Lowry over Stephs mom any day
"loved watching Rockets Legend Clint Capela play alongside Rockets Legend Kyle Lowry, Rockets Legend Carmelo Anthony, and Rockets Legend Goran Dragic"
"I like to pick cool players in the east who I like and watch their games. For example I like Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler so I end up watching a lot of raptors and heat games, and really liked the philly/toronto series. I like bradley beal, too, but I only watch their games when they're playing a good team."
"&gt; Do you have any examples of other players like that that just continued to improved in their late 20's ? I had Lowry but honestly Lowry was already really good on Houston.  Steve Nash is the best example. When he was 30 I don't think anyone considered him an all-time great. He was a 2x All-Star and 2x All-NBA Third Team after 8 seasons in the league.  After the age of 30:   * 2x MVP * 6x All-Star * 5x All-NBA (3x First Team, 2x Second Team) * 5x assists leader * 4x 50-40-90  As you mentioned, Kyle Lowry is another example. Yeah he was pretty good pre-Toronto, but in Toronto he took a massive leap. Same case with Paul Millsap - he was pretty good in Utah, then signed with Atlanta and became a star."
the kyle lowry trade likelihood is increasing by each day! he will be a clipper! you're wrong!
I would put Karl Malone over Paul Millsap in Louisiana.  I would also put Pete Maravich over Kyle Lowry in Pennsylvania.  Those names come to mind off the top of my head but I know ranking players all time isn't easy.
"Don't worry man. When SAS implodes we getting Derozan and LMA off waivers, and you know when we get Derozan TOR will release Kyle just so they can win a ship together.   We gonna have Lowry, Derozan, Lebron, AD, Gasol, with Schroeder/LMA in heavy rotation.   League F'd."
"As much as it pains me to say it, I could see Kyle Lowry asking for an out if we aren't going to be competitive this year. A right he has surely earned, but man would that break my heart."
We would die for him. He can do no wrong. Watch the 30 point comeback game over the Mavs last year and tell me again about how Kyle Lowry doesn't impact games.
I believe if Kyle Lowry played for the Lakers he'd get 4 more free throws a night and be talked about constantly
"If you're strictly talking about impacting the game in ways other than scoring, Kyle Lowry has to be at least Top 10 in that regard (or Top 5 imo).  But as an overall player, I think he falls into that Top 25-30 range. He can't be your best player if you want to win a championship, but he's shown he can be the 2nd or 3rd best."
Kyle Lowry is still our best player lol
Not a superstar but Kyle Lowry is a multi-time all-star.
"""Pull up like Tracy McGrady from the Pistons"" - Blueface  ""This is Metta World Peace before the peace came, bitch"" - Amine (in the same verse he also mentioned Artest vs Derek Fisher and Malice at The Palace)  ""Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump"" - Earl Sweatshirt"
Would you be interested in selling Kyle Lowry for assets then saving those assets plus OG and Powell for KAT?
How does Kyle Lowry have the reputation of being a flopper without the foul shots
DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry.  My squad is solely in my imagination. üòîüíî
"You don‚Äôt play basketball at an elite level tho. Who would you rather have, Kyle Lowry or Tacko Fall?"
Kyle Lowry
We also had Kyle Lowry and one time all star Goran Dragic on our team.
Serious question. Can Kyle Lowry dunk?
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy yeet it from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
*Kyle Lowry and Trey Burke star in the seasons most anticipated sequal...*
"Credit to Boucher of course, but also some must go to Kyle Lowry yet again helping a big man to maximize their talent. Amir, JV, Serge, a championship-winning reconnection with Gasol, and now Boucher."
Keep Kyle Lowry away from Brooklyn
"He's the type of player that's useful on weak teams, but at that size he' sjust not useful.  Look at teams that went far into the playoffs recently, to survive at that size you have to be a Kyle Lowry/CP3/VanVleet type badass, heck even VanVleet can look unplayable when his shot isn't falling.  The traditionnal 6'0 back up point guard who runs an offense and does nothing special is for the mediocre teams at this point"
Chris Boucher and Kyle Lowry dragging this team through the mud
kyle lowry ain't no spot up yeeter he aint gotta run to the corner to yeet like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy yeet up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time

"But when Kyle Lowry does it, the defender committing the ""foul"" is just admiring the view"

"Incorrect. Korver missed 2 games but Teague, Horford, and Milsap played every game in the ECF.  Moreover, you can make hypothetical superteams with 3 all-stars that people wouldn't consider favorites or even contenders. For example a team with Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Kemba Walker."
Yeah that was my thought.  Steph still gets shit.  KD still gets shit.  People question Kawhi's leadership ability.  Lebron has rabid critics (but that's probably more about the GOAT conversation).    The best recent comparison might be Kyle Lowry.  Since the Raptors won most criticism of him has stopped.
kyle lowry
Lowry was basically a journeyman at that point of his career though. Ben was drafted by the Sixers plus he's been the top dog most of his life unlike Kyle. Likely way bigger ego to bruise.
"Every time the announcer said this dude's first name my brain went ""what? Kyle Lowry isn't on the Bulls.""   Every. Goddamn. Time"
"Your argument about sports medicine helping athletes recover from injuries makes sense but I don't think you can connect that to athletes playing at older ages.   I don't know about other sports but I do know that nba legends tend to play until they are ancient there are endless examples like I have listed. Even for lesser stars like Kyle Lowry there are endless examples of nba guards playing at this age before the sports medicine of today.   John Havlicek played until he was 37. Andre Miller played until he was 39. Mark Jackson until he was 38. Sam Cassell until he was 38. Gary Payton until 39. Jason Kidd until 39. John Stockton until he was 40.  If NBA players continue playing after they are 40 then you can argue that sports medicine is possibly the reason why or maybe argue athletes are evolving because playing after that age would be an actual step forward. What is happening currently is normal. And no, using someone like Lebron as an example won't prove anything guys like that are anomalies that aren't representative of the majority."
Kyle Lowry went from playoff joke to hall of famer on that 2019 run.
"Kyle Lowry made 3pt called as an offensive foul, Sacramento."
Wait till that TNT insider starts posting the Kyle Lowry thicc comments
I can‚Äôt believe this team really refused to trade THT for Kyle Lowry
Can't tell if it's Kylie Jenner or Kyle Lowry from that view!
"I mean especially with how fast free agency moves these days, I think a huge part of it for the receiving team is still not having to wait and have your entire free agency ruined while the other team decides if they're matching.   for a team like, say, the Knicks, this could be the difference in whether Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley or Dennis Schroeder are still around."
Kyle Lowry was better. Honestly Fred VanVleet might've been better too  We are doing better than you this year and your rebuild is delayed because you refused to trade Lowry at the deadline. You won one championship after being gifted stars for the past 20 years. LeBron owned your entire city for the better part of a decade and you're incredibly lucky that Kawhi bailed you out of mediocrity. The Knicks will rise again and the Raptors will go back to the gutter where they belong
Dr. Kyle Lowry head coach flint tropics
Does Kyle Lowry have a single enemy outside of Aaron Gordon?
I don't think its useless but if you have a good defensive frontcourt you can even play Isaiah Thomas and still have a good D.   What defines a team's defence is their frontcourt and you can see how much its hurting Toronto to not even have a bench caliber rim protector on the roster this year. It doesn't matter that they have FVV and Kyle Lowry (among the best guard defenders in the NBA) because their frontcourt is getting murdered every night.
Well deserved! Kyle Lowry has been one of the few franchise players in Raptors history and has been the franchise‚Äôs de-facto leader for the better part of a decade.
Yeah but making him untouchable and not doing a move for Kyle Lowry to keep him seems crazy to me
If OG calls him Doctor then there‚Äôs no question to be asked his name is Doctor Kyle Lowry.
What about Kyle Lowry praising it when his team is in 10th? lol
There's a lot to admire about Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry got away from Demar Derozan and everyone forgot about how he used to choke in the playoffs
lol never thought my tiny ass university would be giving out honorary doctorates to Kyle Lowry. lol
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry has the 7th thickest backside in North America
"Between last year and this year Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka left town (and their age was showing anyway).  Kyle Lowry turned 35 and his age is showing.   Paskal Siakam, last year's break out star, suddenly can't hit threes. And they traded Norman Powell, who wasn't a star but was a solid player."
It's not about heliocentrism. Kyrie can get his own bucket for sure but is a sub par playmaker. KD when he gets his own bucket his efficiency craters. Going from one of the most efficient scorer in nba history to just good levels like 58% TS compared to 62-65%.  The whole reason the clippers failed is because they don't have true pg who can get buckets for others. They recognised that which is why they traded lou will for rondo. Tor in 2019 had Kyle Lowry who is an elite playmaker that year especially (wasn't he 3rd in assists that year). Milwaukee absolutely run a heliocentric system in years past. They have reduced it this season but they have struggled to capitalise on the pressure that Giannis causes defence because no one finds those holes (and to a certain extent when they did they shot like 20% from 3). Boston have been pretty ass this year and their recent winning run has coincided with Kemba walker taking a back seat on his scoring and focusing on facilitating and getting Marcus smart their best playmaker back.  Lack of playmaking is almost always the downfall of teams. And without Harden they have a dearth of it. Maybe dinwiddie coming back will fix thatb(if he is actually fit). That plus I don't trust KD and Kyrie in terms of health and sacrificing for the team in the post season then if the meet someone decent in the 2nd round it will be very tough for them.

Slow Kyle Lowry.   Slowry. He is taller than Kyle tho.
Knicks need a pg. They will give Kyle Lowry the max this off-season
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"&gt;i don‚Äôt care about garland being explosive as a leaper, he doesn‚Äôt need to be.  well, then you can take my point about JA's expllosiveness and move on, because you're just agreeing that he's not Ja level of explosive.    &amp;#x200B;  You don't care, but you spent all this time arguing that he can get to Ja's level.  so which is it?  &gt;he literally just needs to add 15 pounds over the next 5 years  which isn't going to work the way you think it will, lmao.  &gt;you‚Äôre referring to when guys say ‚Äúyeah i gained 15 pounds of muscle this summer‚Äù and i agree that‚Äôs bs  it's not just that.  its also based on real times when people did come in with more muscle, but that isn't how explosivness works.  so much of it is genetic.  there's a million powerlifters who could out squat Nate robinson but very few of them will be able to dunk like that.  besides, what if tis all upper body muscle?  he jsut got better at taking contact maybe but it wont help him jump better, or take that first step better.  you're drawing stright lines that involve way too many assumptions that don't work out in reality.  15 pounds is a meme, even when they really did put on 15 pounds.  it almost never works out so cleanly.    &gt;but i am talking about somebody like Kyle Lowry or Goran Dragic who added some mass so they could better finish at the rim. Garland‚Äôs biggest problem right now is that he shoots like 2 free throws a game. in order to get that up to at least 6, i think he needs to add weight so he can better absorb contact  sure, but that still has nothing to refute my point that garland is never going to attack Giannis directly the way Ja tries to.  THAT is the difference.  Garland will break free from his man at times, but Ja has the potential to make a defender irrelevant in ways that Garland can't do at the rim.  and that matters.  i'll put it this way.  Chris Paul can still get to the rim and finish, but what he did before his knee was still a bigger threat than what he can do now, even if he can still juke almost anyone."
"i don‚Äôt care about garland being explosive as a leaper, he doesn‚Äôt need to be. he‚Äôs already plenty quick so he doesn‚Äôt need to get quicker or faster. he literally just needs to add 15 pounds over the next 5 years   you‚Äôre referring to when guys say ‚Äúyeah i gained 15 pounds of muscle this summer‚Äù and i agree that‚Äôs bs. but i am talking about somebody like Kyle Lowry or Goran Dragic who added some mass so they could better finish at the rim. Garland‚Äôs biggest problem right now is that he shoots like 2 free throws a game. in order to get that up to at least 6, i think he needs to add weight so he can better absorb contact"
Billups was a beast in his prime. Picture a better version of kyle lowry +5 stats with the leadership of cp3.
"Looks like Kyle Lowry numbers to me, just worse in every aspect."
"If people are really calling them nothing, they should have no problem recognizing Kyle Lowry as the best floor general in the league, I mean he took a lineup of him/DeMar/Demarre Carroll/Luis Scola/Bismack Biyombo to the ECF and went 6 games with the championship Cavs."
You think no one has ever called Marcus smart on it? I support Raptors. Doesn't mean I don't know that Kyle Lowry is a flopper. I am not saying he is not as good as his numbers make him seem. I am saying his detractors think that. I think Harden is a top 5 player in the league. But I also think he looks for contact on purpose and I don't like that.
I like that Kyle Lowry implants that Steph has. Lookin' juicy.
Kyle Lowry would totally take the charge tho.  Short thick dudes are like walls.
"This guy is averaging 3.7/1.9/0.9 and has an OBPM of -2.8  I get that defense is where he makes his impact, but he gives you literally nothing offensively. Kyle Lowry is still a plus defender at his age, and would've given positive offensive impact."
"Yeah Lowry would be great for this year, but we still have a young team.  The point of keeping Thybulle is you need him in case you decide to trade Ben. A elite wing defender is very pivotal to a championship team. We have 2. Unless we getting a young star I don't think Thybulle is even being entertained. Kyle Lowry obviously didn't fit that criteria."
"Jimmy D hasn‚Äôt been poking around since he vetoed the Kyle Lowry trade during the 13/14 season, a brilliant decision as always. But point is that he hasn‚Äôt been interfering for a while now but they still continued to suck anyway so nobody thought anything of it until now with daddy Leon righting the ship."
The NBA wanted us to trade this guy for a 35 year old Kyle Lowry.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[What about that time Kevin Hart sent Kyle Lowry to the shadow realm](https://youtu.be/YlyIz3kKZOQ)
"How does Lowry fit your team and DeMar no lmao?  (from one of my previous comments) DeMar is the perfect fit both for New York and him. They need someone at the wing that can finally pass the ball and RJ can complement him easily. Also add the fact that the Knicks have cap space so they could even sing Lowry too, they need a PG! If Kyle and DeMar see this opportunity to finally reunite in a team that perfectly fit them, I see no reason not to do so. Just saying: Kyle-RJ-DeMar-Randle-Robinson and Quickley as a 6th Man with some other vets would be a really really nice team!"

"You think Kyle Lowry thought of himself as just a modest role player? You think he thinks oh I just rebound, make passes, and play some defense? Nah he thinks I‚Äôm fucking Kyle Lowry mother fucker I ain't no spot up shooter I aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like I'm some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time I'm not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time fuck outta here with that modest mindset I'm Kyle Lowry I'll fuck your bitch and shoot over ya stfu"
Kyle Lowry?
"He's still fantastic scoring guard despite the bad percentages. And I think the rim avoidance is just a league wide trend. What sub 6'5"" guard besides Russ and Ja still gets to the rim consistently? I definitely agree with his interchangeability being the problem with  his fit but also Kyle Lowry would fit well on every team lol."
"Yeah Ive gone back and forth on the Kemba thing. I think he's important from a gravity perspective. He's the one Nick Nurse was giving the box and 1 treatment to last year, the Kemba double drag pull up 3 is still one of the most important things in that Boston offense. In a sense the goal of the point guard is to make plays for others and whether you do that through gravity, passing etc doesnt functionally matter that much.   But then on the other hand yeah he has specific limitations. My biggest thing with him is he's too small and limited off ball to be a major weapon in that sense so when he's on the court you kind of have to run pick and roll with him which can sometimes mean too much Jaylen chilling in the corner. He also just doesnt get to the rim anymore, his ability to get separation and collapse defenses from that sense isnt the same just not as scary to defenses  Interchangeability is alot of what Boston wants offensively when I was talking about the read/react on the fly type approach. You dont get that with Kemba really. A Kyle Lowry type would fit better and integrate into that read/react stuff. Problem is finding that type of guard is hard. It's not just playmaking, that offense doesnt get to the rim unless it's Jaylen attacking closeouts, they do need someone to stress defenses in those kind of ways."
But were not. Those stats are always based on minutes played together.  Look at the raptors lineup. That means there  better w.o Kyle Lowry   suns better without cp3
"Kawhi beat a prime 76ers team, Giannis, and the Warriors to win a championship. His second best player was Kyle Lowry. Lebron needed Kevin love and Kyrie Irving to do the same thing. Kawhi‚Äôs also beaten Lebron to win a championship.   He‚Äôs not even 30 yet. Lets allow him to finish his career first before you call him 25-40 all time. If he wins a ring with the Clippers he will be top 10."
"&gt;Even before the NBA season began, things were already weird for the Toronto Raptors. They were about to get weirder.   &gt;The pandemic forced the Raptors to become NBA snowbirds as they relocated from Toronto to Tampa, Fla., where there are palm trees outside and ‚ÄúWe the North‚Äù signage inside, a move that turned out to be the beginning of a season that would make absolutely no sense.   &gt;They have since become the league‚Äôs most puzzling anomaly. There are good teams and bad teams every year in the NBA, but there has never really been a team like the Raptors. They‚Äôre either a bad team that‚Äôs good‚Äîor a good team that‚Äôs bad.   &gt;This is how much of an outlier they are: The difference between the Raptors‚Äô expected number of wins based on their statistics and their actual number of wins is the largest of any team with a positive net rating in at least three decades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Stathead data.   &gt;There have been 39 teams in NBA history with losing records and positive point differentials, meaning they outscored their opponents for the season and still lost more games than they won. Most were barely under .500. There is one notable exception. The lowest winning percentage on this list of basketball aberrations would belong to this season‚Äôs greatest source of dissonance: the Toronto Raptors in Tampa.   &gt;They appear to be the best, worst NBA team of all time.   &gt;The Raptors are currently sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference with a 22-34 record after being ravaged by the coronavirus and living away from home while most people are stuck working from home.   &gt;If the NBA playoffs started today instead of next month, they wouldn‚Äôt even qualify for the league‚Äôs first play-in tournament. Not making the playoffs when more teams than ever will make the playoffs would be a huge disappointment, and it might even make sense at this point to bottom out temporarily and increase their lottery odds in a tantalizing draft.   &gt;But what makes the Raptors more interesting than other bad teams with tanking incentives is that it‚Äôs still not clear if they‚Äôre one of them. They have the mathematical profile of a team that‚Äôs actually good.   &gt;A funny thing about the NBA is that a team‚Äôs win-loss record is not always the most reliable metric of whether it‚Äôs good or bad, since that number is subject to luck, random variation, statistical noise and so many other vagaries of playing sports. A better measure in the short term is a team‚Äôs net rating‚Äîthe point differential per 100 possessions‚Äîand the Raptors have outscored their opponents. Their net rating is higher than the teams in seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th place in the East.   &gt;There is even a stat called Pythagorean wins that predicts a team‚Äôs expected record from the number of points it scores and allows. It was devised by the pioneering baseball quant Bill James and then applied to basketball by Philadelphia 76ers president Daryl Morey when he was a Stats Inc. researcher as a college student.  &gt;But not even a formula designed by the greatest analytical minds in sports and named after a Greek philosopher‚Äôs theorem is powerful enough to crack this NBA team.   &gt;The numbers suggest the Raptors should be 29-27. Instead they are 22-34.   &gt;Those numbers are skewed by their peculiar ability to win big and lose close games. The Raptors have somehow won nearly the same number of games by 20 points or more and 10 points or fewer. They also had six game-winning or game-tying shots in the final seconds of the fourth quarter before April‚Äîand missed them all. That helps explain why they would be the first team ever to outscore their opponents and lose more than 60% of their games.   &gt;That‚Äôs also part of the confusion. They have the statistical indicators of a good team and the record of a bad team. So which is it?   &gt;The answer is probably both, but it‚Äôs a tricky question. One of the more trivial difficulties of playing basketball during a pandemic is that it‚Äôs hard to tell what to make of a team. The season is shorter. The games are packed tighter. The arenas are emptier. Add injuries and Covid protocols. Subtract home-court advantage. What do you get?  &gt;‚ÄúA season unlike any other,‚Äù said Jack Armstrong, the Raptors‚Äô television analyst for the last 23 years.   &gt;But when it comes to evaluating any team this season, it‚Äôs hard to ignore the massive purple dinosaur in the room.   &gt;The NBA has managed to plow ahead with minimal disruptions and, like the rest of the country, can see light at the end of the tunnel with players getting vaccinated and fans trickling back into arenas. The worst seems to be over. But in a sport where one case and the subsequent contact tracing can wipe out an entire team, this season was inevitably going to favor teams that were spared the wrath of a microscopic pathogen.   &gt;Toronto wasn‚Äôt one of them. Raptors players have missed 114 days because of Covid-19 protocols, according to a Fansure study of the league‚Äôs injury reports. Only the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics were hit so hard.   &gt;Their exposure started with a Feb. 26 announcement that coach Nick Nurse and five members of his staff would be working remotely while sidelined by the league‚Äôs health and safety protocols, followed by Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby being out for more than two weeks each. The Raptors had three games postponed and then lost nine straight from March 3 to March 22‚Äîand the Covid-related free fall could have been worse if not for a weeklong break for the All-Star Game.   &gt;At the beginning of March, when their record was 17-17, they could squint at glimmers of hope. By the end of March, when they were dealing with the human toll of being demolished by Covid, losing 13 of 14 games and nearly trading Kyle Lowry, they were staring into the NBA abyss.   &gt;‚ÄúPretty much everything that could possibly happen,‚Äù Armstrong said, ‚Äúhappened.‚Äù   &gt;There are still reasons to believe this might be a good team disguised as a bad one.   &gt;It‚Äôs why the more obviously good teams aren‚Äôt exactly clamoring to play the 2019 champions if they can sneak into the playoffs. As far as first-round opponents for the Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers or Milwaukee Bucks go, this one would have the rough appeal of wrestling a velociraptor.   &gt;And it wouldn‚Äôt be entirely surprising if the Raptors do something else that no team with a losing record has done in three decades: win a playoff series."
I think it was Kyle Lowry or Damian lillard.
oldest point guards to be all-nba players are steve nash at 36 and john stockton at 37.  looking at the current play of kyle lowry and chris paul if we are re lucky steph still has 3-4 years of all-nba play left.
Official Status  Kyle Lowry - DNP resting from the intense rehabilitation of the toe injury for which he has now recovered from.
"Actual injuries are a bigger issue than some team that nobody is watching resting guys to avoid injury and increase lottery odds.  How much has LBJ and AD being out cost the league? Probably more than raptors resting Kyle lowry. Bars here are closed anyways, we're in full lockdown with nothing to do."
there‚Äôs a plausible scenario where the knicks make the conference finals this season. i‚Äôm in. i‚Äôm smoking that good shit that knicks fans smoke. i am ready to be swept out of the first round and sign kyle lowry to a three year deal in free agency. fuck it that‚Äôs the star piece we need to win a chip
I think Kyle Lowry has him beat there
"Imo they need a good leader to bring out their chemistry and elevate their role players, like what LBJ or CP3 bring to a team. Kyle Lowry could be great for them.  Plenty of talent already, but the team just doesn't click quite right. They're one move away from a dynasty."
"Isiah Thomas isn‚Äôt close to a top 10 pg of all time. He got lucky to play on arguably the most stacked team ever and gets way too much credit that should go to Dumars/Laimbeer/Aguirre/Rodman/Dantley. He wasn‚Äôt efficient or good on defense. I‚Äôd take Kyrie, Lillard, Mark Price, Kevin Johnson, Chauncey Billups and Kyle Lowry over Isiah."
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."

Kyle Lowry has a phat ass
&gt; The team's success has never been a Kyle Lowry carry job.  I'm not sure. He's consistently brought a bunch of misfits to really good records. And a lot of past theories for the Raptors success (eg DeRozan) have been disproven. Lowry probably deserves a lot more credit for their success than he generally gets.   Over a large sample size he generally seems to have top ~10 impact by advanced stats - the simple explanation is that he's just that good.
I've watched all the games and Kyle Lowry seems like the same player to me. The team's success has never been a Kyle Lowry carry job.
Your flair is kyle lowry
LeBron has better ass than Kyle Lowry
"I don't trust these all-in-one metrics. Last year Kyle Lowry was ranked 12th. This year he's ranked 94th, between Rudy Gay and Raul Neto. What am I supposed to make of that?"
Yeah on 55.3% TS while playing with Kyle Lowry and Pascal.  [Also where did you get 18/4/7?](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/vanvlfr01.html)
"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
Kyle Lowry can only dream of being as good as Herro.
"I don't think it's an overpay. I think Tyler's ceiling is a LouWill/JCrossover type. Borderline all star with explosive scoring but lacking not elite in playmaking and or defense. Precious has potential but is incredibly raw. Lowry is an all star and one of the top PGs in the league right now. You're gambling on win now vs potential future. I would choose Tyler/Precious's potential personally, but I understand why Toronto would ask that for Kyle"
This is spot on. He‚Äôs the anti-Kyle Lowry in that he‚Äôs super lanky. Also he‚Äôs a very good shooter for his size so it just makes sense
"Can confirm, would love to have Kyle Lowry on my team."
"I honestly think more opposing fans hate Lowry. If you ever visit an opposing team's game thread when playing the raps, 50% of the comments are how much they hate Kyle. But they'd all love him on their own team."
"Meanwhile, the Nuggets started out the season 1-3 but don't have to have excuses made for them because they've taken care of business. The Clippers have routinely had a revolving door of 2-5 guys out on any given night for at least a month now and are still streaking (their entire starting lineup was out just last game, 9-man rotation in that one and 8-man two weeks ago against the magic).   Giannis didn't even get to the position of 3-1.   Kawhi has shooting capability, footwork, and other intangibles over Giannis that led him to those titles (titles, because he has 2). Funny how people swear up and down that Lowry was the reason they were in those games but completely gloss over Kawhi averaging 30.5 PPG for the entire playoff run. Kyle helped, but you're delusional if you think he could carry anywhere near the load Kawhi did.   Kawhi is still more than elite defensively (this is such a tired narrative, lmao). Guys are still scared to challenge him and only really do so when there's no other choice. KD straight up said it's tough for him to get in his bag around Kawhi and that was just at the start of last year.   Piggybacking off that, KD also said that Kawhi has the longest scouting report in the [same interview](https://twitter.com/TomerAzarly/status/1181649656880582656) whenever they face off so you can take that lie about teams not gameplanning against him you just told and throw it out the window, lmao. Not even gonna dignify that other lie."
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar derozen ,Lowry's weight ,play making ,defence , 3 point shooting and IQ . DeMars height  ,mid range  and finishing"
Don't forget Kyle Lowry was 26 when he got to Toronto as well. Some guys are just late bloomers. Obviously don't expect Yuta to get to kyle's level but he can develop into a great help defender and if his shot keeps improving can turn in to an elite 3 and D guy kinda like a younger Jae crowder but a couple inches longer.  Seth is the perfect example needed the right opportunity to break in to the NBA.
"I‚Äôll just say this. Kyle Lowry got to our team and averaged 12 and 6 on a 34 win team after being relatively unsuccessful for the first half of his career. The team didn‚Äôt immediately change because Lowry got there and it‚Äôs honestly baffling that you can say that Casey disn‚Äôt develop this middling ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù player into the likely Hall of Fame player he turned out to be. Casey got there a year prior and turned the equivalent of a 28 win team into a 59-win team and laid the foundation for a championship. Lowry, Derozan, Ross, Powell, JV and so on wouldn‚Äôt be near the players they turned out to be without Casey. (And theyll be the first to tell you that).   Please just stick to watching the Lakers because it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt know shit about any other teams. If you understood what the Raptors were like before Casey, you wouldn‚Äôt have said any of the dumb shit you said."

"Fuck it, pay Kyle too and just see what happens I dont even care at this point. Lowry, Lavine, PDubs, Derozan, Vooch sure why not"
"Lakers 1st rounder is essentially a 2nd rounder.   But I get it, THT could be anything, he could even be a Kyle Lowry!"
"Knicks! It's the perfect fit both for New York and him. They need someone at the wing that can finally pass the ball and RJ can complement him easily. Also add the fact that the Knicks have cap space so they could even sing Lowry too, they need a PG! If Kyle and DeMar see this opportunity to finally reunite in a team that perfectly fit them, I see no reason not to do so. Just saying: Kyle-RJ-DeMar-Randle-Robinson and Quickley as a 6th Man with some other vets would be a really really nice team!"
Better: Kyle Lowry  Worse: sexton
Kyle Lowry almost became a Knick in 2013
"I never said he wasn‚Äôt a good player, never said he wasn‚Äôt a career leader, said hasn‚Äôt lead the Raptors to much success this year. I love Kyle Lowry, he went to Villanova and I‚Äôm a big Nova fan. His stats just don‚Äôt resemble that he is not as good at 35 as he was in his prime."

"Hi AD, big fan here. I have a quick question for you. I know you don‚Äôt like running as the 5. Is it due to the fear of having Kyle Lowry back you down in the low post? And if so, how do you plan to conceal your erection?"
Kyle Lowry.  Oh wait you said face
"ok i could be wrong but the problem i see is that the team you have right now WORKS, and you could throw in kyle lowry and chris paul and toss a bunch of your extra pieces and maybe it would work but maybe it wouldn't. that's the whole gamble. so i get why you're saying about them not being 'must-keeps' but also they've got you to 4th in the east and it hasn't looked flukey, so maybe you keep these pieces together and add 1-2 on top of them rather than saying ""yeah we're keeping RJ and Randle and the rest can go if needed"""
he could turn out to be as good as anybody. maybe even as good as kyle lowry one day!
I consider myself a juiced Kyle Lowry
Doesn't seem like it when someone posted about Kyle lowry in a nuggets vs Lakers high light LOOL rent free baby
"Hell, 6 foot nothing Kyle Lowry has outrebounded centers lol"
Fuck Kyle Lowry
"yeah must be a fluke, hope this kyle lowry guy can figure it out and have a nice career"
Lowkey Kyle Lowry and Siakam were hitting ridiculous shots.
"Remember that thread recently about how you can't know about a player for sure until he's 28 or so? Like Kyle Lowry? Mo is 22. Nowhere near a bust, just a long term project as expected. He could still be a good player."
1.John Stockton 2. Chris Paul 3. Jason Kidd  4. Russell Westbrook 5. Gary Payton 6. Tony Parker 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Damian Lillard 9. Derrick Rose 10. Rajon Rondo 11.Kyle Lowry  12. Chauncey Billups 13. Stephon Marbury
Kyle Lowry
"Per OP‚Äôs question, none of those teams have Kyle Lowry so Lakers are probably fine."
"Dolan is still a big issue.  It's also slim pickings this offseason in terms of ""big names"".  35 year old Kyle Lowry is the only ""big name"" realistically on the market."
Why u acting like that‚Äôs some normal for Kyle Lowry?? Lowry is a proven all star
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"For the Raptors, it's still Kyle Lowry"
"The fact AD has been mentally and physically checked out all season and the fact that LeBron was injured is the reason why Pelinka didnt make the Lowry trade  Trez may leave after this season but THT is the Lakers best chance at replacing Schroeder with a cheaper, younger option or at least maintaining two guards, THT/Caruso, off the bench.  Why blow your load on Kyle Lowry when you know you arent even going to make the Finals?"
When he gets shit on by other teams I'm like how can you possibly hate Kyle Lowry if you actually watched him play? Especially considering his size and age and his sheer will to win at all costs.
Kyle Lowry was hurt and that team consistently underperformed in the playoffs even in the series they won.
"76ers going with George Hill because the asking price for Lowry was too high might be a really interesting inflection point when we get to look back.  If you don't like the deal you don't like the deal, that's fair, but a month from now when the games really matter I wonder if they'll wish they had Kyle Lowry's three point shooting and defense when they're matching up against Boston or Milwaukee."

"I‚Äôm gonna tell my kids, Juicy by Biggie was about Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry follows NBA news way more than he lets on and I bet he felt a type of way about how he was being talked about at the deadline lol. Plus we always beat the Lakers anyways.
All round legend Kyle Lowry
"Lowry is expiring. Not to mention, if the Lakers went all in and made the move, you'd have a tried and tested championship PG who'd be hungry af for the chance to compete and get another ring.  Him being 35 is irrelevant because he's Kyle mfing Lowry- Lebron is 36 and still performing well, right? Lowry willed us into a Game 7 with the C's last year, he willed us into the W tonight.   I get that maybe to someone who doesn't understand his value, it seems like a bit much. But Kyle Lowry was worth that, because he'd boost your chance at another ship by THAT much more."

"Does it have to be based on performance for your team?  I'm a Raptors fan.  He didn't do much for the Raptors, but Hakeem Olajuwon is clearly the best player that ever wore a Raptors jersey.  If only based on what they did for your team, then I'd say Kyle Lowry."
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry did king shit and nobody on the Lakers contested a shot for the last 4 minutes

"Kyle Lowry, Raptors"
"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
Blake with a Kyle Lowry special there  Fake hustle but in reality dirty play
"Trae and Kyle Lowry aren't dirty players, they just flop. This guy flops even more."
He split second option duties with Kyle Lowry. Not the same.
"Kyle Lowry for obvious reasons but before him it was KG. I love that hard nosed, tough af mentality."
"This is more like when Kyle Lowry got his opportunity. He was awesome in Houston but they were enamoured with Kevin Martin for some reason and didn't put the ball in his hands. Then he went to Toronto and his first full season they got rid of that boat anchor Rudy Gay, put the ball in his hands and he was was immediately Kyle Lowry. If you got to the game logs you can literally see where they changed the offence and he immediately starts filling it up. He was always that guy."
"A fun thought experience is to try and think of who the current Kyle Lowry might be (27/28 year old who has been decent with flashes, but might blossom into a perennial all star)?  The obvious answer to me would be Randle? Curious what others think."
"Well, right now he is basically Rockets Kyle Lowry in all those ways.  Waiting for him to become Raptors Kyle Lowry."
kyle lowry has put up a shitload of games with like 1/9 shooting but he contributes in many other ways
I see his ceiling as like...a 6'5 Kyle Lowry? Perennial all-star caliber
I'd make a joke here but my team has Kyle Lowry on it
what are you talking about. There a bunch of solid FA options. We dont need to address a star this year as long as we build upon our success and guys like RJ and Randle improve stars will come to us   **2021 Free Agency**  * Kyle Lowry  * Mike Conley * CP3 (PO) * Kawhi Leonard(PO)   **2022 Free Agency**  * Zach Lavine * James Harden (PO) * Jimmy Butler (PO) * Bradley Beal(PO)
"You can make a good argument for kyrie over klay, he‚Äôs been the better player for longer, 7 all stars to 5 for klay, and same amount of all nba teams even though he should have been in a couple more of not for missing games. I think it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs been superior.   He has more points assists rebounds and steals than klay over the decade while doing it at the same scoring efficiency and he was the main offensive player in around 5 of his seasons.   To be honest I‚Äôd consider Kyle Lowry over klay as well. He‚Äôs been dominant rapm over the decade, like top 10. I think you‚Äôre seriously overrating klay because of his rings"

"You know when Kyle Lowry became and allstar right? Also thats a terrible point. Giannis is already an MVP level player at this age, so him room to grow isnt that big. Whereas Christian just got into the league and has room to grow and develop as he works on his body and skills."
Lmaoooo fuck Kyle Lowry
They could have had Kyle Lowry for him.
"Draymond Green (Shaq), Blake Griffin (Chuck), Kyle Lowry (Kenny)"
Kyle Lowry is up there by himself
"These Villanova boys are something else in the league. Bridges, Hart, Bey, Brunson, Paschall, etc. OG Kyle Lowry. Jay Wright is really doing something."
Kyle Lowry for that matter ha. Such a joke
Kyle L-l-l-l-lowry
Bet you wish you had Kyle Lowry now
Heat sure could use a Kyle Lowry right about now.
"Bro what? If Kyle Lowry can‚Äôt make Baynes look even passable, he‚Äôs completely washed."
Heat have a Kyle Lowry shaped hole in their roster :/
"Are you comparing Tim Duncan to Mike Conley? Duncan was getting MVP votes, All NBA selections and All Defense selections while Kawhi was his teammate. Do you think Kawhi was carrying the 2014 Spurs to their championship that year or something? He only averaged 13 ppg that year.   Tony Parker also made no fewer than 3 All NBA teams as Kawhi's teammate. LaMarcus Aldridge was All NBA twice as Kawhi's teammate, and once finished top 10 in MVP voting before Kawhi left. Kyle Lowry is a 6x All Star, including the one year he was with Kawhi.  Then we have Mike Conley, who's never made an All NBA team and this year made his first All Star team as an injury replacement. You're way off here, sorry. Kawhi has had *plenty* of help in his career."
"Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and Paul George. These guys have all been All Stars and All NBA players. ""No stars"" üôÑ"
"Kawhi and Kyle Lowry/CP3. Don't even need to give Lowry or CP3 the max though, so if they truly have enough for 2 maxes, then they could go Kawhi, one of the point guards, and then another high level role player.   Knicks could legitimately just sign Kawhi, Lowry, Ibaka, and Danny Green and add a solid portion of the Raptors championship team to their squad."
Also are there 2 free agents worth giving max contracts too? I‚Äôm not crazy about the idea of maxing out 35 year old Kyle Lowry.
Jrue holiday  Chris Paul  Kyle Lowry   Ben Simmons  Mike Conley  Even Steph curry is able to play solid defense while running around a zillion screens
"&gt;Dude even AFunkyDiabetic has said this.  ????????   Whoever that is, if they said that Kyle Lowry can guard centers then you should probably never take anything he/she says seriously. He's literally 6 foot 196 lbs lmfao."
No but of your (roughly) 72 comments in that thread there was plenty of dumb takes  Ie: [He thinks Kyle Lowry can guard positions 1-5](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nm3wrb/what_player_has_a_higher_ceiling/gzmgl91?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
Fan dumps popcorn on Russ banned for life Fan who shoves Kyle Lowry Banned for 1 year fined $500.000 and is now back sitting courtside.
That‚Äôs interesting you mention playmaking because 2 years ago when people were comparing Kawhi to all time great wings like Wade and Kobe people brought up that he was a step below those guys as a play maker/Facilitator. Kyle Lowry took care of that.  Kawhi was perfect for that team because they just needed a guy who can get buckets.
Kyle Lowry esque. was skinny for like one season lol.
Hell no. They could use Kyle Lowry though lol.
You mean like how Kyle Lowry charged for two counts of battery against  a female referee but never got canceled and went on and later went on to win a championship! But hey as long as fans are held accountable I guess players don‚Äôt need to be
"Imagine leaving Kyle Lowry to go play with Patrick ""the next 5 years are mine"" Beverly."
"I'm surprised they went that far with it, but it definitely wayyyyy crosses the line.  ... on the other hand, the minority owner of the Warriors who shoved Kyle Lowry is back, so..."
"i wasnt paying super close attention at the time, but why didnt the clippers try harder for Kyle Lowry?  i think they're a good team, but there's no way you can win a championship without a good point guard. all that money spent on PG and Kawhi will be for nothing if they don't get an above league average point guard."
"I‚Äôm not sure Kyle Lowry over Randle gets us to a 4th seed tho. Even though I agree Lowry is obv a better player and more proven. The thing about Randle for all is faults, not many could have played the insane amount of games and minutes to carry us to a 4th seed with relatively little help compared to other playoff teams."
"Can we really call Kyle Lowry the ""best"" in franchise history if he was never the best player on a team in any specific season? Greatest, yes, best, absolutely not."
"Nah, it won‚Äôt be. That‚Äôs like saying Pippen‚Äôs, Pau Gasol, Chris bosh, Kyle Lowry, Kevin love, Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, James Worthy, just to name a few all have tainted legacies too? You‚Äôre just being a Unibrow hater."
You need a Kyle Lowry to kick everyone‚Äôs ass into gear
Are you under the impression that Kyle Lowry guards 1-5? I...... don't even know what to say to that. Maybe you're confusing him with OG Anunoby?  PJ Tucker guarded 5s for like one season and took a beating doing it and he's 2 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier than Dort lol
You gotta be Kyle Lowry if you‚Äôre gonna fall on your ass that hard.
Its fun talking shit about Gobert selling  contact knowing full well my favorite player is Kyle Lowry.
How good would this Knicks team be with 1. Kyle Lowry
I mean yea the Clippers should obviously want Lowry but Idk if 35 year old Kyle Lowry will want the Clippers
And yet they give Bev all Defense. There were better players that deserves it. Top of my head Kyle Lowry or OG. Raps were in the top seeds in 2020
Kyle Lowry?
&gt;chase someone like Kyle lowry  He‚Äôs 35. No one is chasing him
Directly next? Lose game 4.  After that? Pray Kyle Lowry or Kawhi come to south beach. Also spend all summer telling Bam to be more aggressive.
Is that where we tell Kyle Lowry to sit?
"Joel ""The Kyle Lowry of Centers"" Embiid"
"‚ÄúBut then if they put smaller guys on him, he just takes them right to the block and he can overpower somebody, because he‚Äôs so big, so strong. His legs are so big and strong, and his butt is so wide. He‚Äôs just a matchup nightmare, because he‚Äôs got both worlds.""  &amp;#x200B;  Me to my gf about Kyle Lowry"
"If Dirk loves Embiid, hed LOVVEEEEEE Kyle Lowry."
Did he think he was asked about Kyle Lowry by mistake
"That's not the definition. He's not a late bloomer, he started late that's it. And became a beast within 3-5 years. He's gifted and talented. A late bloomer is someone who has been playing basketball all his life and only at 27 it clicks and he's becomes really good or elite. Kyle Lowry is more of a late bloomer than Embiid.   Definition: ''someone who becomes good at something after people usually become good at it''."
Kyle Lowry is another great example of what you illustrate here. First All-Star Selection in his 9th season and proceeds to make five more afterwards. Future is bright for Randle!
As a Spurs fan‚Ä¶become? He is lucky he had Kyle Lowry to be a leader in Toronto because on his own he doesn‚Äôt have those leader chops even though he is a great player.
"Exactly. That's why he should have stayed with Kyle Lowry and FVV, who have more leadership in their pinky toes than half the stars in this league."
Patrick Bev is trash. The Clippers would be so much better if they had a pg like Kyle Lowry.
It looked more like when LeBron did the fade-a-way over Kyle Lowry during the LeBronto game
can't beleive Kawhi wanted to play with Pat Bev instead of Kyle.  At least Lowry is THICC
I agree 100%. Kyle Lowry was the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of that Raps team and there‚Äôs no one on the Clippers filling that role.
"Led by Kyle Lowry. Kawhi got to shine more, but he wasnt leading shit."
"this dude here trying to claim pat bev is a better defender than jrue holiday or kyle lowry. but everyone else is dumb.   pat bev is pretty good on ball when against quick guards. that's about it though. overrated as fuck because he got under kd's skin a few years back and espn decided to make it a story.  it's questionable if he should even start in this league, much less for a team with finals aspirations."
Lol at Kyle Lowry.
"I could see folks starting to question Kawhi's ability to lead a team. I think it would be dumb to do so, but NBA fans are very reactionary. If the Clippers get swept, I could see fans starting to retroactively attribute more leadership to Tim Duncan and Kyle Lowry, and credit them moreso for Kawhi's two titles, and say stuff along the lines of, Kawhi is an incredible player but he can onlly win if he has a true team leader. A sweep should not do anything to Kawhi's legacy, especially if he keeps putting up numbers like tonight.   PG doesn't have a legacy."
The Spurs had Pop and Duncan. Raptors had Kyle Lowry.
"Curry, Harden, Chris Paul, Lillard the list goes on. Your best player doesn't need to also be a playmaker, but if he isn't then you better have some fuckin good playmaking (e.g. Kyle Lowry in the '19 title run)."
"Cause the Heat got hustle last year. Heat were playing how the clippers is actually advertised. And even if we say last year Raptors with Kawhi is better than Heat, no shot they're still winning. Cold Siakam, and older Marc Gasol are the reasons why. Kyle Lowry and Fred are the most vital piece of their championship but we knew how the Lakers dismantled small shooting guards last year."
Because maybe he‚Äôll realize he‚Äôs not number one option worthy? That‚Äôs the biggest problem with the Clippers is there‚Äôs no actual leader on the team.   Kyle Lowry was literally the leader for Toronto
Nah bro that was all Kyle Lowry. He was the leader of the team and inspired his entire team to elevate. It took massive pressure off of kawhi too
That‚Äôs why you need a guy like Kyle Lowry next to him.
Kyle Lowry was the alpha on that Raps team
Are you actually stupid? Did you watch Siakam in the playoffs last year? He was literally way worse than Pandemic P and Kyle Lowry dropped 0 points in the playoffs. So many people don't even watch games and just regurgitate low iq narratives.
"Going from Pat Bev &amp; Rajon Rondo to Kyle Lowry is a pretty massive upgrade, a starting caliber primary playmaker is definitely a major need on this team. A new coach isn't changing the fact that Kawhi always has to run the offense in late game situation bc Rondo can't defend, Manns too young, Jacksons so sloppy, &amp; Bev is too unskilled. Kawhi is not Kobe or Lebron and that is OK."
"PG and Kawhi are both terrible leaders.  Duncan/Manu/Parker were the soul of that championship team.  Kyle Lowry was the heart of that Raptors.  Kawhi had the opportunity to match his greatness with KD or Lebron, but he folded after he left Toronto."
Pretty much the only hope the Clippers have is a sign and trade for Kyle Lowry. No team is giving up draft capital or players for a going to be 32 next season paul george that doesn't get them over the hump
"I mean Kawhi is still obviously a phenomenal player... he's just a different player, and the roster around him doesn't maximize the type of player he is because it lacks a Kyle Lowry/FVV combo he had in TOR, or Parker/Ginobli in SA. I don't think he needs dudes that are on that level even, but he does seemingly need someone to run the car while he picks his spots to take over, especially on nights when they REALLY need his defense.  So it's kind of a non-answer but it's just hard to say who is better, they're not really comparable dudes. Depending on what I'm trying to build I might take either one, but Harden is probably easier to build around, especially in the current game, so maybe that does make him better?"
The Clippers are proof of how underrated Kyle Lowry was without his leadership the Raptors don't come close to a championship he was their heart. The Clippers don't look like they care out there.
"Kawhi can be the best player on the team, but he will still need a Kyle Lowry."
Kyle Lowry on a vet minimum incoming
"Kawhi you'll always be a legend for that 2019 Raptors run...  But I ain't gonna lie, it's NICE to see your team crash and burn again, you could have 3 peated! But you settled for Pat Beverley when you had Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry to Clippers confirmed
Kawhi left Kyle Lowry for a team with no basketball IQ. He deserves this
"Kyle lowry as well, surprisingly."
He's no Kyle Lowry.
"Tristan Thompson, Kyle Lowry, and Andre Drummond are all you need for the answer to that question."
"Drummond was a free pickup dude, literally didn't cost the Lakers anything.    You would have more of an argument saying Lakers fucked up not trading for Kyle Lowry and giving up Kuz and THT.  Drummond is not great at defense and he took a long ass time to figure out his role at all but he isn't out there because of some agreement or whatever nonsense r/nba pushes.  He is out there because Vogel wants him out there.    Point is Lakers win or lose aren't because of Drummond."
Yeah that's laughable when Kyle Lowry is 10x the defender Bledsoe is

They'll get Kyle Lowry or Brad Beal or someone. Jimmy isn't going anywhere they just need to get off their high horse and move Herro and whatever else for a win-now piece

"Completely agree. I think going for a Kyle Lowry or even Mike Conley (if he leaves Utah) this off-season would make sense for them. Plus getting a big that can spread the floor, create a pick and pop option for Zion to create with, unlike Adams and Hayes."
Kawhi comes back to Toronto. Kyle Lowry decides to stay. We run it back (2 years late)
"How this dude won an all-defense second team selection over Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, and Jimmy Butler last year I'll never know."
Kyle Lowry is the best charge taker in the league
Kyle Lowry Yeets. No one yeets it like Kyle.
Kyle Lowry would make the Heat a much better team.
Heat really refused to entertain trading a dude who's more concerned with being an IG influencer for James Harden or Kyle Lowry
"jrue is the ultimate x-factor guy, similar to kyle lowry but less controversial pre-chip."
Kyle Lowry trash bros vs now differential
"Yeah I guess, I‚Äôm a fan of both but I‚Äôll still take Butler over PG because of leadership, playmaking and defense. His stats may not be mind blowing but he does a lot of things others doesn‚Äôt want to do, similar to Kyle Lowry. I‚Äôd have loved Lowry on this team."
"Doubt Kyle Lowry goes back to Houston, spent most of his career transforming an ok team into greatness, doubt he wants to do that again. Man wants championships"
"Unless Kyle Lowry signs with the Heat this summer this team isn't winning anytime soon and Lowry barely pushes the needle for them if we are being honest. The 76ers, Bucks, Nets are just head and shoulders better than them anyway you cut it."
this the mf that held up the kyle lowry trade
Something about Kyle Lowry. But not sure who was talking about Lowry in a game thread between the heat and bucks. Dude has a few screws loose
Kyle Lowry would have been able to stop him
The Heat could use a player like Kyle Lowry right now...
"See then there Kyle Lowry and Fred Vanvleet, who routinely play 38+ minutes and clearly have some chunk on them"
Kyle Lowry
"&gt; Certainly some shorter guys are more athletic than lebron  there is not one criteria for 'athletic' (if you look at where the term comes from, athletics, or track &amp; field) there are many things. And certainly the term ""purely athletic"" is a meaningless phrase. Speed, power, endurance, explosiveness agility among others.  Is a high jumper more ""pure athletic"" than a miler?  No, they are both athletic, but in different ways.    Jordan was probably one of the best (if not the best) jumper ever in the NBA (I think his vertical *still* is the highest ever recorded iirc).  And his endurance, even as he got old was second to none. But even though he was explosive, he wasn't that quick (in terms of pure speed). And it took him a few years before he filled out enough (strength, size, power) to widthstand the pistons beatings (he didn't want to add weight because he worried it would take away from his explosiveness).  And just to be clear, explosiveness is what you do when you jump, speed is running.    So Jordan had, explosiveness, endurance and jumping ability over Lebron.    Lebron though was more well rounded. His extremes weren't as high, but he had more things that worked in his favor.  Unlike Jordan, from high school, he had no physical (relative) weakness.  He obviously had strength and size.  But he was also faster (not just for an NBA player, but straight up... e.g. he was faster than Curry a much smaller player).  He had excellent endurance (less so as he ages mind you), which was necessary to play both sides of the court (but not as much as Jordan).    So Lebron had strength, size, speed over Jordan.    What most folks mean when they say ""athletic"" is often one of jumping ability, or muscles (visual).  But guys like Jeremy Lin or Kyle Lowry were athletic, but in different ways (Lin was very fast, Lowry has a strong booty... which made him so strong he's impossible to post-up for most guys). So MJ &amp; Westbrook meet this rather narrow definition of 'athletic'."
Kemba plus pick(s) to Raptors sign &amp; trade for Kyle Lowry
"The Bulls really want to acquire a top point guard.  Whether they can or not is another matter.  There would have to be a trade involved and they have limited assets.  But they surprised people when they traded for Vucevic.    Vucevic, LaVine, and, say, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, or Chris Paul doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the Bulls an instant title contender, but it would go a long way towards making the Bulls a legitimate playoff team.  If they get Lowry or Paul the hope would be that the aging superstar mentors Coby White."
2015 klay and draymond are both better than 2019 kyle lowry who was kawhi's best teammate
Great not to see Kyle Lowry on the list! Wasn't sure if he'd be there or not
"Gonna have to max Kyle Lowry to make the strategy work, the originator of that move."
"Top 8 for C's that year:  1) Rookie Tatum  2) Soph Brown  3) Horford  4) Smart  5) Marcus Morris  6) 3rd Year Rozier  7) Aron Baynes  8) Rookie Semi Ojeleye  Top 8 for the Raptors:  1) Kawhi  2) Kyle Lowry  3) Soph. Siakam  4) Soph. FVV  5) Ibaka  6) Gasol  7) Norman Powell  8) Danny Green  That's a ton of talent on the Raps side. If that goes beyond 5, I'd be shocked."
Kyle Lowry hooking Paul George‚Äôs  [arm](https://youtu.be/5C473YX3w-A) as he fell
"I'd look for other fringe all-star candidates that are on max contracts. Then see if any make sense for both teams.  So Tobias Harris, Kyle Lowry (sign &amp; trade), Westbrook, Wiggins, Conley, Hayward, Kemba, Siakem, Murray, Draymond, Ingram etc.  Not all those guys would make sense but that would be the kind of guy I'd be targeting if I was the GM."
the mans earning Kyle Lowry money with not even half the impact. He's a good player... but not worth *that* much money.
Kyle Lowry starts fouling on purpose for the fans
Sixers really look like they could use Kyle Lowry right about now
"some players you could just tell they are bitchmade, like kevin durant, chris paul, paul george, where it isnt too surprising no one likes them. Then on the other spectrum you have just awesome people like kyle lowry, boban marjanovic, and jokic where if you hate them, there is something wrong with you"
"Some of his past submitted posts:  &gt; Comparing Porzingis and Jokic to rookie Gasol and Dirk. The generation of great European big men.  &gt; So far Jokic has the highest PER from any rookie drafted in 2014. (He was picked 41st that year)  &gt; If the Grizzlies called and offered Mark Gasol straight up for Jokic, would the Nuggets consider it?  &gt; Nikola Jokic 16 Points Full Highlights. Next Dirk?  &gt; Could we trade for Blake Griffin in 2016?  &gt; Cousins to the Nuggets trade, Is it possible?  &gt; Are Kyle Lowry and jeff Teague better than Ty Lawson? If so, why?"
Chauncey Billups aka Kyle Lowry
...like LeBron played in a tough East? The East LeBron played in post 2013 was maybe the weakest it had been ever. Only the early 2000s compared. LeBron is great but look at his CF opponents from those years. Jeff Teague and Al Horford won 60 games. DeMar and Kyle Lowry and a 21 year old Jayson Tatum were LeBrons biggest roadblocks to the Finals.
"there are players way less mobile than harden with worse shooting, worse court vision and worse handles that still are valuable in the league. take mike conley for example. the only thing he is better at than a way less athletic harden is perimeter defense. and he ist an important piece for a contender. or kyle lowry. or patty mills. or maybe even chris paul.   if giannis loses most of his athleticism he is definetly worse than blake griffin currently. worse shooting, worse handles, worse playmaking"
"Not exactly the same at all - Steph Curry showed up this year, and was amazing to watch despite the fact that it was clear from the start that they wouldn't be contending. No Westbrook triple-double record or Wizards fighting into the playoffs because, fuck it, what's the point. Kyle Lowry gets 10ppg and gives up on defense because Raptors were bad this year.  If other players took not-bothering to seek a trade to the extent Blake Griffin did the league would be utter shit. I'd rather Pelicans Eric Bledsoe and Cleveland Kevin Love were the exceptions, thanks."
hear me out: Kyle Lowry.  yes he's old but he does all of those things well and he can play off-ball just fine.
Very random but I remember on hte first play of the Raptors/Magic series in 2019 Aaron Gordon tried posting up Kyle Lowry and that same thing basically happened.
I wouldnt say that  Getting Kyle Lowry would improve your team significantly. Similar to the Rockets after they got CP3  OR you could save the max slot for next year before Luka‚Äôs contract kicks in  Either way it‚Äôs a good position to be in outside of the Porzingis deal
The 2nd option was Kyle Lowry.

"There's a difference between getting easily bumped out and literally not battling for it, ever. Almost anyone can box out anyone. Kyle Lowry very frequently boxes out huge dudes. If he practiced the positioning and explosion up to the ball then I guarantee he would be a better rebounder.  The part that bothers me is if he likes to play the perimeter, it makes the most sense for him to grab the rebound. Marc Gasol would sometimes trail behind after tossing the rebound up and he'd trot up to a wide open 3. Pretty common play for bigs that can shoot. He's slow as fuck too so it's not like he's ever in a good spot for a transition play, and it's almost never worthwhile to get it to him early in the low post."
I think part of it was us getting good to quick. That coupled with the KP trade made it so we really weren‚Äôt able to add many extra developmental pieces around Luka. Deff need to add something. I‚Äôm hoping for Kyle Lowry personally but we will see.
I'm sure Danny Green saw a lot of this from Kyle Lowry on his time with Raptors.
He doesn't have a booty. That's honestly the real problem. You put a Kyle Lowry butt on the unicorn and you got yourself an All-Star.
"Kyle Lowry, DeRozan is actually a good half court scorer too that can ball handle but he's not a guard"
"He‚Äôs like the same height or around the same as Steph Kyrie Irving, Trae young, and taller than Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry"
"That sounds right, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll kick in until next year.   That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think the Porzingis contract hurts them much. Next year Luka‚Äôs extension will kick in and Hardaway Jr will have a pay raise as well, which means that this season is the only one where the Mav‚Äôs will have cap space, regardless of what they do with Porzingis.   Unfortunately for them, there aren‚Äôt really any max worthy guys available this season, so dropping Porzingis‚Äôs contract just to clear space  this season doesn‚Äôt really make sense either. Maybe a guy like Kyle Lowry or DeRozen would make sense?? But they can sign one of those guys *and* keep Porzingis."
"only thing is, I know y'all have the cap next season for lowry, but it will probably still hurt to pay him 20 mil per for 3 years given that's what he's going to ask for.  he's made it clear that he's not taking a pay cut and still wants to go to a contender.  but yeah having kyle would take so much pressure off of luka, insanely smart defender and facilitator and he won't need the ball in his hands a lot to be effective because he plays off-ball quite a bit when we run him with fred sometimes."
"I‚Äôm sorry but no, CP3 is not more important to them than Book. He‚Äôs their Kyle Lowry, but I‚Äôd be damned if anyone thinks he‚Äôs better than kawhi(Booker)"
"Trae at this point has a much better than trajectory than either PG or Kyle Lowry. Luka is the better player, but either way in this trade, the hawks got a superstar to lead them to dubs. Cam still plenty of potential, as well."
"Better than KD, Luka, Lebron, Embiid, Jokic, Steph?  Simmons would need the shooting of like Goran Dragic or Kyle Lowry so that‚Äôs like 37-40% from 3 and a good midrange shot 80% from the line"
Kyle Lowry
"According to Length, Size, &amp; Girth I'd pick Serge Ibaka.        If I had to choose based on Shape &amp; Thiccness obviously Kyle Lowry.    üçÜüí¶"
"KPs contract + the lack of trade assets make it difficult to move him this offseason, so I wouldnt be shocked if they just stick with him. I'd throw everything at Kyle Lowry, though. A phenomenal secondary playmaker who can defend at a high level sounds like a great fit to me. And if you can't get him, I think pursuing Richaun Holmes would be a pretty good move."
"If Mavs are outbidding Miami, Kyle is theirs. Lowry always takes the most money on the table, as he should."
This is controversial but :  Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry is going to be on like 8 teams next year lol
"He is injury prone and dramatic, but other than that, you can tactically use him.   KP needs to be load managed but I don‚Äôt know if Luka is mature enough to accept that since he carries the team nightly.  Duncan was brilliant enough to realize Ginoboli was also injury prone and need to be load managed and come off the bench.  They need maturity on this team, dare I say a veteran like Kyle Lowry would help.  A company doesn‚Äôt pay you what your worth, they pay you the price necessary to add the piece necessary for the team. Giving up on KP without proper usage will bite them in the ass when another team uses him judiciously."
Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt a superstar LMAO.  Neither was Kawhi in 2014.  Bosh and Klay aren‚Äôt superstars either.
Kyle Lowry is not a superstar as is Klay or Bosh or Duncan/Kawhi in 2014.
There‚Äôs no way in hell Kyle Lowry was a superstar. So yes it is possible.
"kyle lowry does not qualify as a superstar  that being said, of course the teams that win are usually the ones with the most top 10 players"
Mavs should 100% go after Kyle Lowry this offseason
Maxi ‚ÄúKyle Lowry‚Äù Kleber
Kyle Lowry fuming rn
There's no counter for Trae and Philly has no one to push the ball.  If Philly had Kyle Lowry all Embiid and Ben would have to do is run and dunk the ball when the D collapse
"Philly needs more speed and leadership, if only they had Killer Kyle Lowry"
it's the Lowry curse; every team that considered but didn't trade for Kyle was gone in round 1 except Philly.
Kyle Lowry joins the chat.
Something something Kyle Lowry
https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-kyle-lowry-says-interest-joining-spurs-real/
Lonzo Ball  Kyle Lowry  Devonte Graham  John Wall (trade)  Kemba Walker (trade)  POSSIBLY Russell Westbrook (trade)  POSSIBLY Damian Lillard (trade)  POSSIBLY Derrick Rose (free agency)
"Simmons and Lowry can't start together, and you're not gonna blow Simmons trade value to get Kyle Lowry who will be 36 by the 2022 playoffs. Yes he fits this team perfectly in the short term but if you're trying to build your future around Embiid and want to move Simmons to bring in a new point guard it has to be someone a lot younger than Lowry."
Yeah but does it really move Philly to being better? I‚Äôd rather just try to get Kyle Lowry this off season.
"Kyle lowry.  2019 playoffs, round 1, game 1, TOR vs ORL  0 points on 0-7 shooting in 35 minutes.  You probably don't remember becuase they won the chip that year.  ...and because he's a dog and probably still had a positive impact on that game, despite the loss."
That's where you condition them during the regular season. They have not even attempted to condition him. It's embarrassing when Kyle Lowry and Chris Paul can play 40+ at this age every game in the playoffs and we have the MVP who is letting his team down year in year out.
No that would be Kyle Lowry
Celtics ain't winning nothing until I see them get a good playmaker that's also a good scorer. A kyle Lowry type player
"Agree for the most part but they need to get more shooting, honestly trying to get Kyle Lowry would do wonders and may have helped this series considering THT didn‚Äôt even play."
"Exactly.  Same as Magic, Michael and Kobe.   Lesser stars like Pau Gasol and one of my favorites Kyle Lowry. Derrick Rose for a hot minute. Many others.   You respect the guys who show up in that place and deliver. That‚Äôs what makes it fun.   For me Lebron is at the top of the list of guys I saw bring it in Boston."
The list of players who only became stars from Year 8 in their career is extremely small  Only Kyle Lowry comes to mind
I have a feeling Dwight will go back to the Lakers this offseason and that they'll resign Drummond. I'm not sure what other vets besides Kyle Lowry are out there for a 1-2 year contract to try and make another run
3 months of rest is the best thing AD and LeBron could‚Äôve asked for. Hopefully Rob makes decent moves‚Ä¶ like letting Drummond go trading Kuz. The teams needs to get younger and more althetic and more shooting. If the Lakers can‚Äôt get Kyle Lowry(they prolly won‚Äôt). I wouldn‚Äôt be apposed to them re-signing  Dennis

This wasn‚Äôt an article about popularity, it was an article about influence. You also picked an article based on the opinions of one person. This is embarrassing.   You‚Äôre going to need to include sources, because one article is saying that average ticket price for a Raptors game is $179 (according to Yahoo Finances on November 2019) and another is barely over $101.   But yeah, the Maple Leafs franchise as a whole is more popular than the Raptors, but that has little to do with the players and more to do with the love the city has for hockey. You can make the argument that Matthews is more popular, but otherwise this  is the equivalent of saying those garbage players on the Lakers in 2015 (outside of Kobe) were more popular than Clayton Kershaw. Just a weird hill to die on.   You‚Äôre talking about trades, I‚Äôm talking about the Lakers giving him a new contract. You already said his contract was un-tradable, but the Lakers willingly gave him that new contract when they never had to. Pay attention.   Man Trez has struggled to stay on the floor for two straight postseasons.   There‚Äôs all the evidence that suggests Masai was willing to keep Lowry, even if he would walk for free in Free Agency. You can willingly ignore it and draw your own conclusions from it but it‚Äôs there. There‚Äôs no evidence of Masai just taking *any* offer just because they‚Äôre the only ones. There‚Äôs no evidence of Masai even having much interest in any of the players offered in these trades even dating back to his Nuggets days, and that includes Tyrese Maxey who they never had any sort of contact with.   And Maxey was surely in his draft range, at least more than Jalen Smith (who the Raptors met with), who was selected way higher than Maxey and their draft selection.   &gt;Caldwell-Pope has way more value that Rodney Hood, and more to the point, way more value than Kyle Lowry   Oh my God, I should‚Äôve known I was arguing with an idiot. Aye man, just because people having been teasing the Lakers about not trading for Lowry doesn‚Äôt mean you have to say ridiculous shit to justify the move. Hope you can recover from this, have a good day,   One thing I will say is that we will revisit this when Lowry gets his money in FA, remind me."
"Some fairly straightforward moves to make.  Strongly suggest for Trez to opt out of his player option using the Klutch + Rich Paul family connection. Let Drummond, Marc Gasol, and Morris walk.  Resign THT and Caruso long term for hopefully under $15mil/YR combined. Resign Wes and Benny Mac to another veteran‚Äôs minimum.  Re-do the entire front court. Look to sign two defensive minded PF/C that can rebound, rim protect, and not ask for post touches. Nerlen‚Äôs Noel and Richaun Holmes both could be affordable and available. Dwight Howard coming back would be fine as well.  See what‚Äôs available on the trade market. If POR is down to blow it up and sell off CJ McCollum I would resign Schroder and package him in a S+T with Kuzma and a 2022 FRP to acquire CJ.  If no trade partners are available I‚Äôd let Schroder walk and see if I can coax Kyle Lowry to signing a 2+1 deal for $20-$25mil/yr.  That‚Äôs about as good as you can do honestly."
"I mean it just seems pointless, and it's purely speculative. .  19 year old Amare was way better than 19 year old Hakeem.  19 year old KG was better than 19 year old Duncan. Look at guys like Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler who didn't even become all-NBA players until their late 20's."
I am not here for Kyle Lowry slander fam you lost me.
36 year old Kyle Lowry
This guy talking about Steph like he‚Äôs Kyle Lowry or something lmao.
"Khem Birch, Fred VanVleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
Funny he never mentioned Kyle Lowry   (I'm kiiidding dw)
"No, if AD was still injured and Solomon Hill still fell on LeBron's ankle, having Kyle Lowry doesn't get them past the Suns, imo"
"People say Kyle lowry is a hall of famer and love has had a better career.   But I think he won't get any serious consideration his regular season accolades compare to reggie miller but, he doesn't have much longetivety and no remarkable playoff moments"
Demar and Kyle Lowry.
"Randle, Wiggins, Jerami Grant, Kyle Lowry. Like this year Kuzma had his most efficient season ever, if he was given more touches he'd be playing better than his rookie year. He probably won't become a star in this league but he has above average role player right this second with potential to do what Jerami Grant does in Detroit."
Guys like Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry are the exception (and there's still a bit of a question mark on Randle after that series vs the Hawks imo)
"Hell yeah there regrets. I was a fan of a possible trade for Kyle Lowry, that man is a great leader, a fighter, and would have been a better player next to Lebron than KCP, THT, and Schroder. However, no offense to the Raptor fans, but Kyle isn't enough to win a championship. We don't win without AD, injuries really hurt this team more than the Sun ass whooping."
It‚Äôs not exactly a subjective list. I can‚Äôt just put Kyle Lowry as The Goat or top 5 all time. Nothing he did supports this.   And there‚Äôs not many players that you can make an argument for that pushes LeBron out of top 3-5 all time.
"Idk Mr. Raptors fan, do they regret not trading for Kyle Lowry?"
Brandon Roy and Kyle Lowry
Crazy that the lakers didn‚Äôt want to trade for Kyle Lowry cause they wanted to keep THT
"I mean, you could also say this is the first year without either LeBron James or Kyle Lowry, too."
You know who will never do this once in his career? Kyle Lowry. (and probably most other players lol)
I'm not gonna lie it's pretty annoying seeing the subreddit talk shit about trading three players for one year of Kyle Lowry and then later praising THT for being a young stud.  Tis the duality of Laker fans
sounds like Kyle Lowry
If lakers had kyle lowry this is going 7 at least even with ad injury
"Raptors wanted KCP, THT, schroder and draft compensation for lowry. Lakers said no THT and Raptors weren‚Äôt interested. Maybe your memory is a little fuzzy.  https://theathletic.com/2477311/2021/03/25/what-the-lakers-were-willing-to-trade-for-kyle-lowry-and-what-it-says-about-the-future/"
"Gotta wonder if Kyle Lowry would have helped here.   If the heat‚Äôs issue turns out to be related to point guard too, I‚Äôm guessing the whole woj bomb circus around Lowry is gonna pop up again"
They still lose though ? No AD is a death sentence and Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt changing that
Or Kyle Lowry
Friendship with Kyle Lowry has ended. Devin Booker is new best friend.
Lmaooooo good thing they chose talen Horton hears a who instead of Kyle Lowry.
We should have went for Kyle Lowry
just imagine THT/KCP were Kyle motherfucking Lowry. Boneheaded ass lakers FO
"It is a top to bottom problem. Accountability, inconsistency, lack of defense. I would like to see Dame, CJ, Powell, RoCo, and Nurk on the floor together again, as they are absolutely fantastic offensively. Ant and Nas both looked fine for what they are. RHJ was fine and might be a good back up. Melo scored consistently well so he might be ok if we can secure our bench defense another way.  We need a back up big that doesn't get trashed against other bigs. We need a rework of the staff. If that means a better HC then I guess that works, but our defense has got to be better. Bringing Whiteside back could be good. Maybe a restoration project with Bagley? Whatever it is, we need a solid back up cast.   Idk what the ideal changes look like in Portland. I personally don't think a bad series from CJ deserves a trade. Kyle Lowry had two historically bad postseasons before finally winning, and I think Dame, CJ, Nurk, Powell and RoCo are a potential championship caliber team with a better defense.  Needless to say, whatever happens this offseason happens. Free agency isn't fun for Portland, idk what would even happen that could launch us to being a contender aside from sharpening up how we play and rolling the dice again with a new head coach."
The lakers could really use a guy like Kyle Lowry rn.  Too bad they chose talen Horton hears a who instead.
If you don't see the difference in the types of flops/tricks... I can't help you lol  Guys like CP3 and Kyle Lowry  exaggerate on opponent's genuine mistakes. They're opportunistic about it.  Trae Young aggressively goes out there and gets bogus calls like getting 3 FTs jumping into guys or stopping on a dime so you can run him over.
"Talen ""better than Kyle Lowry"" Horton-Tucker"
So Kyle Lowry is  white dwarf?
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Nah. Back then the consensus was KG was a first ballot hall of famer even with just his time with Minnesota. The media and his peers knew that the problem was the organization doing a bad job of surrounding him with talent. It wasn‚Äôt his shortcomings since that dude played all 5 positions just to drag that team to the Western Conference finals where he met Shaq and Kobe. Bill Russell even wanted to give him one of his rings because from his point of view he was already a champion. That‚Äôs why he cried ‚ÄúI got my own‚Äù when he finally won.   What you‚Äôre saying applies to you since you believe the nonsense of the media and their barbershop talks. It‚Äôs media that created the culture of ‚Äúchoking if no championship‚Äù and then it trickled down to fans and players. The reality is that the better and healthier team wins. Sometimes your key teammate gets injured and it‚Äôs suddenly a different story. It had nothing to do with choking. Just luck. Sure star players sometimes miss the supposed to be winning shot or even the crucial free throws to support the ‚Äúchoker‚Äù description but the fact is that team wouldn‚Äôt be in the position to contend at all without that star player. I would never label Charles Barkley, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Malone, or Stockton chokers. They‚Äôre great players. I can‚Äôt say they‚Äôre above average just because they have no rings. They carried franchises and filled up seats with their talents. All 5 of these guys reached the Finals and just lost to other stars with a better supporting cast. Is Rasheed Wallace better than Malone or Barkley since he has a ring? No. Is Kyle Lowry better than Stockton and Nash? Not really."
\*Kyle Lowry has entered the chat\*
Maxey was good for the time he got in the playoffs I would rather have Maxey over Ben and Kyle Lowry over Ben if that‚Äôs what Bens going to do in the playoffs
"bet he goes bankrupt because he acts like he deserves as much as MJ received on his last season with bulls. (thats in todays money, of course.)  Kyle Lowry makes more threes than he did in a month with one game and he wants $70M more than him. idiot"
Kyle Lowry would‚Äôve been a much better option too
"That‚Äôs interesting. So its 2 yr deal with LAC vs above the cap (non taxpayer) teams who can offer the full MLEx3yr and under the cap teams.  Alex Caruso is 27 with 4 year of NBA miles, RJ is 31 with 10 years. I see Caruso getting looks at the MLE range, maybe even an offer for $1-2 mill above MLE but looking below, it becomes unlikely and he instead see offers from other teams operating above the cap for full MLE.  To get a contract above MLE for RJ, half the league is able to do it: NYK, SAS, OKC, MIA, CHA, DAL, MEM, TOR, NWO, CLE, HOU, ATL, CHI, SAC, ORL, DET.  Looking at those teams, does RJ get a $12-15 mill offer from DET, ORL, SAC, CHI, ATL, HOU, CLE, NWO, TOR, CHA, OKC that would pry him from LA...I don‚Äôt think any of these teams make a real play for RJ as they already have their own guards and may not want to throw $50-60 mill for someone to be their 3rd guard in most cases. CHI could offer their entire cap space ($13-15) for him to be their 3rd guard if they want to compound it to show Zach they want to win ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but I think they have other targets.  Realistically, the only teams that chase are NYK, MIA, DAL...could include SAS MEM but they both have young guards and SAS cap space could get eaten by resigning free agents (Mills, Gay, DeRozan). RJ also has to contend with other PG Free agents:  Spencer Dinwiddie 28 Lonzo Ball 23 Derrick Rose 32 Patty Mills 32 Kyle Lowry 35 (Other PG unlikely to switch teams - cp3 and conley).  For the above the cap (but below tax payer bracket) teams: PHI, PHX (CP3 opts out and inks a $90 mill 3 yr deal), BOS, DEN, WSH, LAL, and IND...I only see PHI or IND making a play for him at full MLE to fill a big need.  Based on this, I think there is a good chance RJ sticks with LAC for that $10 mill/yr (for 2 years) that they can offer him. Unless PHI or IND enter the picture. Like Marks said, it‚Äôll be an interesting free agency!"
Chris Paul is Kyle Lowry with better PR
Alex Caruso for Kyle Lowry who says no?   /s
"Siakam has proven that he is able to the second or third guy on a championship level team. For the next couple of years, the Raptors won't be trading him for anything less than someone who could be the best player on a championship team. Maybe in the last year of his contract they might flip him for very speculative assets, but not anytime soon.  The Raptors don't make deals for the sake of making deals. Masai Ujiri turned down a bunch of offers he considered to be too low for Kyle Lowry this year, even though he might walk for nothing this summer.  Wiseman was disappointing this season, and didn't stay healthy. He might someday turn into a player you would build a championship team around, but that's looking less likely than him being a pretty good role player.  Even if the Raptors do want to eventually move on from Siakam, it makes more sense to hold on to him and wait for when some superstar level player gets disgruntled, and trade Siakam along with some first rounders for the Superstar. Dame, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum - all of them seem to be in super frustrating situations and may want to leave in a couple years."
The Lakers ‚Äúhave communicated‚Äù they want Dennis Schroeder to take whatever they need him to take to make the money work in a Kyle Lowry sign and trade
Cap. [They started cheering well after the play when KD tried to stand up and had a noticeable limp.](https://youtu.be/aFnFHX_XbWQ?t=23) Kyle Lowry was visibly ashamed of them.
Kyle Lowry
"More a function of who he's always been behind, like Paul, Young, Andre Miller, Jrue Holiday, even Kyle Lowry.  3x 6th man of the year for a reason, though."
"Was he a superstar when he won that ring in Toronto? Sure.   But he was still a plug and play character on that team. We all knew that Kawhi wasn‚Äôt staying in Toronto, it was just where he‚Äôd been sent for the time being after things erupted in San An. That ring was integral to Kyle Lowry for being the face of the franchise and second option on the team, it was integral to DeMar DeRozen by virtue of the fact that he was sacrificed in order for Toronto to make the run, and it was integral to Siakam‚Äôs ‚Äúarrival‚Äù.   He‚Äôs a great player, and he deserves all the credit that he earned for contributions made to those 2014 and 2019 title teams. It just seems he hasn‚Äôt won a ring that‚Äôs distinctly ‚Äúhis‚Äù. Winning one with the Clippers would definitely change that, I think, but with how PG13 has stepped up in his absence even if he makes it back in time for a Finals matchup should the Clippers win the conference, you pretty much have to ask if Kawhi‚Äôs the true number one of the team or if the Clippers have the most of a 1a/1b situation that we‚Äôve probably seen since Magic and Kareem. Most contending teams that would have to go the amount of games without their number one option that the Clippers have played without Kawhi would usually have been eliminated by now. I definitely think that Frank and West should consider building around PG more so than Leonard going forward considering the nature of the ailment his legs are suffering from."
This is the Kyle Lowry pasta. I feel like this is the Kyle Lowry pasta.
"Kyle Lowry is actually a bit of a spot up shooter from time to time, and that‚Äôs OK."
"Fwiw that team was on pace to win 58-60 games before the rondo trade, then they trade role players and filler for an all star still in his prime in Rondo??   Replace Rondo with Kyle Lowry and that team is incredible. They had 3 guys who could go off for 30 points any given night and all three could create their own offense, Parsons and Ellis were both great secondary ball handlers and Tyson was an elite defender still and great roll guy.   With Rondo they were like a 45 win team, but before the trade they had an all time great offense with lots of weapons and chemistry. Not title favorites by any means but if Dallas somehow was able to get Conley or Lowry instead of Rondo I think they could‚Äôve been a fringe title contender that year. Warriors were still young, as were the Rockets, Thunder were injured and Spurs were showing age. West was pretty wide open that year."
Kyle Lowry is better than Chris Paul
"Conference semifinals this is my point about revisionist history, And then went 23-25 the next season. Ewing dominated that series because he was the better player. So because Kyle Lowry and siakim went to 7 in conference semis is Kyle now a top 10 point guard of all time?"
But I literally said Kyle Lowry and siakim just did the exact same thing when kawhi left. And they went 23-25 the year he actually came back.
well its easy to diminish his results in the east. The best player he beat those years were a young paul george and jimmy butler and kyle lowry.
"He was drafted and loved the same Lakers scouting department that drafted gems like Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Zubac, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and Larry Nance later in the draft. Or the fact that Frank Vogel who is one of the smartest coaches in league love him. Or he‚Äôs being developed by Phil Handy the best development coach in the league that has specifically worked with Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis. Or the fact that he rates in the 96th percentile according the Basketball Index in his getting to the rim rating. Or the fact he‚Äôs getting personally mentored by Lebron. There‚Äôs definitely a chance for the kid to succeed but have fun with your day."
Kyle Lowry.  That man is so frustrating to watch play against your team.  Him trying to nutmeg his whole body through George hill and then complain was all time.
"I‚Äôd put Kyle Lowry in the hall of really good, not the hall of fame though"
"Kyle lowry cultural impact on Canada cannot be understated  The ring makes him likely candidate for HOF  If your organization has 1 championship in 25 years, those players on that squad are going to be legends to that fan base   If that fanbase is an entire country...well"
Exhibit A: Kyle Lowry
"""The All-Star game is awful because nobody is actually trying to play real basketball.""  Except Kyle Lowry, his taking of charges two Allstar games ago jump started that game."
"&gt; If the Blazers are a believer, the Lakers could have some traction. Horton-Tucker can earn up to about $33-$46 million over three or four years via sign-and-trade. Portland would have a team salary limit at roughly $143 million for the 2021-22 season, which should not be an issue. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers would need to include additional salary, starting with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma. Others, like Montrezl Harrell (if he opts into his final year at $9.7 million) and Alfonzo McKinnie ($1.9 million, some of which would need to be guaranteed) could round out a deal, especially if the Blazers were willing to include center Jusuf Nurkic, who notably told a Bosnian media outlet if Lillard is out, he's out. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers also have the No. 22 pick, which can be dealt in August when Horton-Tucker is eligible for a sign-and-trade (legally, Los Angeles would not be able to select a player at Portland's direction). The Lakers can also send one of their 2027 or 2028 first-rounders and five of their next seven second-rounders (through 2028).  Imagine trading Dame and Nurkic for pricy rotation players, the 22nd pick, and a future 1st.  That's basically what the Raptors were requesting for a couple months of Lowry."
"Lol, okay. That means anything. Kawhi Leonard and a slough of other dudes had to go to that Raptors team to put them over the edge from being in that constant upper Eastern Conference  tier to going to the finals and becoming champions. That‚Äôs no disrespect to them, but without Leonard, Gasol and a much improved Siakam, that team would still be where Philly is today. Just being really, really good. Again, no disrespect, everyone needs a good team around them, but lots of dudes in the NBA are champions who don‚Äôt compare to CP and there are even more Hardens and Lillards and Embiids who are on the same HOF level who haven‚Äôt won anything. A single championship doesn‚Äôt immediately make you better than anyone. Lol. Lowry struggled to start the first 5-6 years of his career while CP was leading crappy Hornets teams to the playoffs. Sheez luiz. You‚Äôve got to be kidding. One is a clear HOFer and the other is Kyle Lowry who won‚Äôt sniff the HOF. My goodness."
"Did you not watch MVPG13 in OKC? Finished 3rd in MVP voting that year, and he played 1a/1b to Westbrook. I think Paul plays better as the first option or with a good floor general. Paul with someone like Kyle Lowry would be an efficient animal imo."
Kyle Lowry better than CP3
"I thought it was strange that there was minimal outrage over this a few years ago when Justin Bieber tweeted for his fans to vote to get Kyle Lowry the nod and cost (I think it was Kyrie) a significant amount of money as a result, since he lost the spot due to the Lowry tweet.  If I were a player and I saw that happen, I'd have immediately given my representation heads up to avoid those sorts of incentives on my next deal."
The CP3 / Kyle Lowry special.
The blatant disrespect towards Kyle Lowry...
"When do you think Wiseman will have his breakout season? People like Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, Steve Nash, Kyle Lowry, etc. took years and years to develop. He may be an 1st team All NBA player someday, but almost 0% chance that happens while Curry is still a MVP candidate."
"who at #7 though, id say that dude from baylor kind of reminds me of a jrue holiday or kyle lowry type"
"Kind of. Raptors fans from 2015 onwards knew Casey should have been fired after the Washington sweep, and I suspect Masai and Weltman knew too, but they just wanted to see if Lebron could ever be defeated.  Media was totally in love with him because they watched maybe one Raptors game a year and crafted a narrative that he was responsible for all their regular season success, when it was actually Kyle Lowry that was consistently responsible for our success after Calderon was traded and Masai gave him the keys. Derozan's 2013 all star spot should have actually been Lowry's. There was even hit pieces from ESPN calling Raptors a shit organization because ""they just fired the coach of the year"", ""wtf are they doing"" etc."
"Kyle Lowry   Vince Carter   Kawhi Leonard   Chris Bosh   Jonas Valanciunas     Bench : Derozan, T-Mac, M.Gasol, VanVleet, Siakam"
"Again, he's 24. I get that he hasn't developed as expected and gets exposed a lot, but ffs he's 24. Not all guys are polished young.   If I'm a team like the Wolves that has a young core and isn't even close to being a contender, I'd rather have a 24 year old Simmons who may one day be an All NBA caliber player than a 36 year old Kyle Lowry. If you wouldn't then that's just stupid. His shot hasn't come, his FT hasn't either, but give it time. Who knows, Simmons may just need a change of scenery. There's A LOT of pressure in Philly. Sending him to a smaller market that isn't in win-now mode may help his confidence and let him figure his shit out."
Wait until the Raptors take a S+T for damn near nothing lol Kyle Lowry. You rarely get a huge return on these players because they're already gone
&gt; FVV+GTJ+OG+Siakam + 4th pick might be good enough to compete don't you think?  Swapping Kyle Lowry for a 19 year old rookie is going to move the needle from 10th place to a contender?  No.  At best that team would fight for the 8 seed and a quick first round postseason exit.  And that's assuming the rookie hits the ground running.
"Not that I think this is a brilliant trade but:  &gt;FVV+GTJ+OG+Siakam + 4th pick might be good enough to compete don't you think?  You're basically taking a team that finished 12th in an injury-plagued, COVID-plagued East and swapping Kyle Lowry, the on-court leader, for the 4th pick - which is highly likely to be a very raw one and done. I don't think that team is going to be competing for much.  At minimum, the Raptors need a new first option on offense, given that Siakam was spectacular as a second option next to Kawhi but really struggled as the first option."
"I mean if we get Wiseman, Wiggins and #7 I'd be happy.  I think Siakam looks like a lot worse of a player when he isn't playing next to Kyle Lowry.  Having #4 and #7 would raise the opportunity of moving up I'd imagine."
Reggie Jackson sign and trade for Kyle Lowry. Ignore the flair. Not biased at all
"Kyle Lowry is a good defender for a point guard, not a DPOY candidate. He‚Äôs never even made an all defensive team. It‚Äôs not at all comparable to Simmons"
"Wonder if they could pull off a 3-way trade with Toronto &amp; Philly. Something like:   - Wolves get: Simmons / George Hill (for cap purposes), 76ers 2021 1st #28  - 76ers get: Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), Malik Beasley, Best of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks.   - Toronto gets: Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, Worst of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks."
"It's not just that he was finals MVP. Chauncey was a floor general, sort of like a Chris Paul or Kyle Lowry type player today. He was known for taking teams to the next level.  Biggest example is when Detroit traded him away for AI and immediately stopped making the playoffs (in fact they haven't won a single playoff game since Billups was traded).  Denver on the other hand, went from getting swept 3 years in a row to to making the Conference finals and taking the championship Lakers to six games."
"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"
"Raptors have one bad year in which they played their home games away from home and all of a sudden they're taking on expiring contracts and helping other teams out? Hell, before the Raptors got hit with COVID they were 4th.  The Raptors will be adding a top talent with the 4th pick. They won't be starting the season with Baynes and Len. Presumably they will be playing at home, although that one is up in the air. Raptors aren't going for Rubio, expiring or not. I fully expect the Raptors to make the playoffs next year and Rubio does not fit.  That trade also [doesn't work](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yzk5drqf) unless Lowry takes a big pay cut ($5M plus). Here's a [quote](https://twitter.com/ByTimReynolds/status/1394656087081639944) from Lowry:  &gt;Kyle Lowry on free agency, noting that he loves the game, but ... : ""Money talks, and years talk. ... At the end of the day, I want to make sure my family is taken care of for generations.""  He still wants to [win](https://twitter.com/ByTimReynolds/status/1394657717114003458), but he has the luxury of already having won in 2019 and if the money isn't right, he's not going to accept it. The 76ers would need Lowry to accept &lt; $25M a year to make the above trade work."
Kyle Lowry ?????
"Kyle Lowry, #4 pick, and Pascal siakam for Lillard and Norm"
"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a 90% chance he becomes a Dame level player. Imo the shooting is still suspect and I don‚Äôt think he has the same shot creation that top tier PGs do. I could see like, a Kyle Lowry+ level player who is better on offense, worse on defense, and not quite the playmaker as his 90% outcome."
Kyle Lowry!
now they're saying it's kyle lowry
Because we didnt fucking trade him for James fucking Harden or Kyle  Lowry.
"We've got a juicy 4th overall pick, and a slightly used Kyle Lowry available in a sign and trade!"
Agree on every point I‚Äôm a huge Kyle Lowry guy. Trey Murphy seems like a good fit for us in that mid first round range (he can shoot and defend and is pretty athletic) though I admit I haven‚Äôt done much scouting if any this year.
Kyle Lowry for Porzingis and a FRP
With the direction your team is going imo I'd rather swing a trade or sign Kyle Lowry in free agency. He's older than Lonzo but does a lot of things much better than him.   I think he's the veteran player you guys need to hit the next level.
Kyle Lowry out here salivating over his free agency prospects
"Maybe I'm forgetting some people, but other than this (which is a 90% chance that Skip is just throwing shit at the wall and hoping he ends up being lucky enough to be right without knowing it), what else is exciting about the off-season?  CP3 opting out for one more big payday, some damaged assets like Simmons and McCollum possibly being moved around, and a FA class whose best players (excluding CP3's opt out and the slim chance of Kawhi) are.....   Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan?  Looking at the list, I can't even think of who I'd put up next after them.  Maybe THJ?  Doesn't exactly sound exciting to me (barring the Thunder going trade-crazy with all their assets/getting more assets, of course)."
KD primary goal is to give these cats buckets.   Kawhi is the same as KD tbh.  The leader of the Raptors in 2019 was easily Kyle Lowry. Kawhi was just hella clutch. The Clippers of today is honestly Ty Lue.
"Some of y‚Äôall are weird because what the fuck does half of that comment even mean    1) ‚ÄúAG is no saint‚Äù‚Äî wasn‚Äôt even even defending AG, but when you get injured to the point of missing the rest of the play in games and playoffs, a game after a teammate tore his ACL, you‚Äôre not going to be the most forgiving person out here.   2) Something something AG MCW bad, Kyle Lowry goat‚Äî I don‚Äôt give a shit about Kyle Lowry being better than those two, I‚Äôd be pissed as a Magic fan if he fucking injured Dwayne Bacon.  I‚Äôd be a shitty fan if I didn‚Äôt."
Kyle Lowry
Unbiased - Kyle Lowry
"He's no Lebron or lowry when it comes to leadership but he does have leadership qualities. Back in the 2019 playoffs Norm, boucher, fvv all spoke about Kawhi being a vocal leader in the locker room. Hell even Nurse and Kyle praised him for boosting morale and rallying the raps in games 3 and 4 against the warriors."
"Lmao, how the hell is Reggie Jackson is more blue collar than Kyle Lowry?           &gt;	superstar attitude.   Superstar attitude &gt; being an actual allstar apparently.            Kyle is also Jimmy Butler‚Äôs best friend."
"If ""won title with a Kyle Lowry level sidekick"" is disqualifying criteria then we're taking out almost every NBA champion ever."
I'd want a little more consistent offense than Rondo. And CP3 has had his issues with star big men. I think someone like Kyle Lowry would be fantastic.
Steph with Kyle Lowry trailing and jumping with him. I think that counts?
You aren‚Äôt Kyle Lowry.
"As cool as it would be to see Kyle play with LeBron and he would finally get the recognition he deserves there in the limelight of LA, I think Philly is where he would fit best. Embiid absolutely needs a Kyle Lowry type PG to play with."
Aaron Gordon on Kyle Lowry.

"Kyle Lowry is commanding a $25m salary, you‚Äôre still short a lot salary wise with those two"
"front offices don't look at their roster which was filled with injuries and go ""this won't work"" when the teams proven to be great when healthy. even if they had Kyle lowry this year, it would come at the cost of the lakers's role player and AD would still be injured so they lose regardless."
"For what? Trez's contract? I mean odds are Kyle Lowry wont be a Laker, but i'm saying its stupid to dismiss it as a possibility as I've literally laid out the steps of possibility for you. You just want to die on this hill for no reason. I'll save your comment for you when Trez opts in."
Kyle Lowry to the Knicks 3 years $80M
"Idk, i still think the healthy nets are better, but Kyle Lowry really is the perfect fit with Lebron and AD, hes just as good at running plays with AD as he would be running around spacing the floor for Lebron.  His catch and shoot numbers are usually pretty stellar and as a point guard he tends towards early offense, which is exactly where the lakers want to play."
"Why do Magic fans hate Kyle Lowry?  Edit - Forgot, dirty play in the bubble."
"Jackie did an episode on the Bill Simmons pod a little while back. They were talking about how great it is for DeMar to be so open about mental health. She shared a conversation she had with Kyle Lowry in which she asked if he‚Äôd ever shared similar struggles, and how he was all, ‚ÄúNo, and how dare you suggest‚Ä¶.‚Äù Does that sound like a conversation she should be sharing with everyone? The point is her style can come across as gossipy and that can rub people the wrong way."
Kyle Lowry and demar derozan vs indy2016
"Took like 2 seconds to Google this, looks like they gave Lowry a Flagrant after no foul was called just this year.  https://www.tsn.ca/upon-review-raptors-kyle-lowry-assessed-flagrant-foul-from-sunday-s-orlando-game-1.1586853   Anything else?"
"PG- Mike Bibby: Dude was the Kyle Lowry of this era  SG- Andre Iguodala: He went way under the radar in Philly and only got real recognition in his 30s in GSW  SF- Andrei Kirilenko- Such a Godly defensive player. The Jazz made the WCF in 2007 because of his amazing defense and the We Believe Warriors knocking out Dallas  PF- Chris Webber- He was forgotten in a golden age of power forwards. C-Webb was right there with Duncan, KG and Dirk for many years though  C- Zydrunas Ilgauskas- He was a great center, a little ahead of his time at the position  6th man- Peja Stojakovic- 3rd King on my list. One of the greatest shooters that has ever lived"
A Kyle Lowry sign and trade for nurkic? I think that could make sense.  I think that‚Äôs dependent on the raptors getting one of the Jalens in the draft though.
Kyle lowry didn‚Äôt shoot it
"Since 1980  16/41 are guys in their 30s   And a lot of the guys referenced had major help from guys in their 30s  Tiny Archibald, Kyle Lowry, KAJ, Shaq w/ wade, Curry was 30 In 2018 when they won. KD was 30 when his Achilles snapped and curry was 31 and would‚Äôve won. KD wins this year if kyrie Aged 29 doesn‚Äôt go down.  I mean 2015 finals Lebron aged 30 was the best player in the world and was fmvp if they didn‚Äôt give it to the other 30+ guy Iggy. 2011 bron you could argue wasn‚Äôt even in his prime because he hadn‚Äôt shown he could win and clutch it. So 2 years in his 20s vs like 4-5 seasons since In his 30s of prime years.   I‚Äôm also saying there‚Äôs more guys in 30+ in their prime than guys early in their 20s. The prime sweet spot may be 26-29 and for the average player fine. But for a star it gets extended. It just does.  I mean does magic drop off at 30 Or does he just get HIV? And his team retires or gets really old leading to MJ   Pierce Garnett, Allen, all in their 30s contending.   Don‚Äôt get me started on John Stockton who‚Äôs majority of all star appearances and all nba 1st and 2nd teams came aged 30+  Or how Karl Malone was the same and won his mvps at 34 and 36   Wilt was 30 and 35 as nba champion, his only fmvp at 35 too, he also won 2/4 his mvps at aged 30 and 31. The other being 23 and 29.   Idc about weighted age, I care about calling superstars past their prime at 30. The ancillary bench guys idc. This is about whether superstars still carry in their 30s or they cooked at 29"
Kyle Lowry and Fred van vleet won a chip on the floor together.
Yeah some team was bound to sooner than later. Just bring in Kyle Lowry and nearly all the problems will be solved.
"It's crazy how for 8 years every smart basketball person has said ""Kyle Lowry is a top 20 or better player in the league and is underrated"" and people on comment threads are still somehow knocking the guy. After everything he's done! After his massive playoffs streak, dragging every conceivable lineup of misfits along with him to the best damn net ratings in the league.  Put some damn respect on his name. Kyle Lowry ain't no"
Kyle Lowry also had a lot less pressure on him as the 24th pick. I just don‚Äôt want my team to have to deal with Sam Bowie with a SoundCloud account
Sixers should keep him and get an actual PG to take pressure off him for having the ball in his hands so he can do what he does best which is play crazy D and run in transition.  They should shoot for Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley. Or maybe even Schroeder if they are feeling froggy.
Kyle Lowry had bad attitude
"Lol no one talked about kyle lowry and no one calls 2019 the lowry year.  Oh and ya, ofc we have seen the clippers results. Cp3s just been chokin longer"
That's what they used to say about Kyle Lowry until 2019.  By this logic you could say we've seen the Clippers playoff results.  This is basically sealed.
"If that goes down, I'll feel bad for anyone who was a lob city clips fan.   I mean, I'd be devastated if Kyle Lowry returned to torch us in the playoffs....it still might happen too üò≠"
"Here‚Äôs my take on all this:  Despite winning a ring, the lakers have done just about the opposite of what you want to do when building a lebron team. The AD acquisition was obviously great, but the Cleveland formula is the obvious one to follow: lebron, 1 big, and 3 shooters. Putting 2 bigs on the floor with bron in the championship year was interesting and it could work because both Dwight and McGee were lob threats, but even that team wasn‚Äôt so great offensively.   Lonzo isn‚Äôt a solution to their problems, and I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs worth the assets they‚Äôd have to give up for him. Of the players they have, the only ones I‚Äôd really want to keep are: bron, AD, Caruso, Wes matthews on a minimum, Marc gasol if he wants to stay, and KCP. Everyone wants them to hit a home run this off-season, but i even think an off-season where rhey could get kemba, mcdermott, maybe buddy hield and a lob threat center would make them significantly better. It‚Äôd be tough to pull off all of that obviously, but easier than getting Kyle Lowry I think."
Really?? I would think Kyle Lowry and Buddy would be a great return. Better than anything I‚Äôve heard sonfar
"I think Schroder is really gonna get screwed this summer. He gambled on himself by refusing the Lakers extension offer, and he really played like shit afterwards. Now he's left hoping a big market exists for him this summer, but he's a point guard in a free agent market flooded with available point guards this summer: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (if a team with cap space wants to use it to absorb his deal). I really don't see any team making Schroder a big offer, which means he may need to just accept whatever he can get from the Lakers, which will almost surely be much less than the $84 million they offered him back in February."
"IKR, like they refused to trade him for Kyle Lowry ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
I lost it when Kyle Lowry took a 3 and they called an offensive foul despite that being his natural shooting form. AND on top of that they give him a tech for‚Ä¶ running away
Difference making playmakers...  Kyle Lowry? Demar Derozan?
Kyle Lowry a Bottom do @ me
"Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry...hmmm..."
Kyle Lowry for that booty
"For the Raptors, getting Lowry meant Masai couldn't draft Giannis, which he desperately wanted to do.   I love Kyle and all and in the end this led to us winning a championship so it all worked out, but not exactly something I'd characterize as a steal."
kyle lowry title run
Everyone doubted Kyle Lowry but the 2019 Champion run solidified him as the Greatest Raptor of All Time.
Like maybe KYLE LOWRY who we didn't get because we wanted to keep THT????
"Not much! Adam Silver has threatened to enforce a culture of compliance, but what is he really gonna do: Like, take away LeBron's phone so he can't text Kyle Lowry? Hack into Dame's IG DMs?       I kinda think the best solution might be straight-up transparency. This could stop teams like the Knicks (I'm a long-suffering Knicks fan, by the way) from desperately setting up a video chat with Kevin Durant's dad to try to lure him to Broadway... even though, by many indications, KD had ALREADY made up his mind to go to Brooklyn... while he was playing in the Finals for the Warriors. And tampering transparency might stop players like KD, Kyrie and DeAndre Jordan from making up white lies about 4 a.m. phone calls on the night of free agency, when they'd clearly been talking about teaming up for months, if not years‚Ä¶ even while Kyrie was still on the Cavs!"
"Lol, so Philly should send him to Toronto for breadcrumbs bc Toronto said so &amp; they don‚Äôt need scorers. What in the r/ChoosingBeggars  Edit: ahhh never mind, another delusional Toronto fan that thinks Kyle Lowry getting carried by kawhi 2 seasons ago makes him an elite PG."
No one with a brain is trading Simmons for Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry
That 2069 pick is what we are going to package with THT to get Kyle Lowry
That sounds a lot like Kyle Lowry
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
Yeah only arguable ones I see are    Rudy Gobert vs Donovan Mitchell   Myles Turner vs Domantas Sabonis   Pascal Siakam vs Kyle Lowry   Gordon Hayward vs LaMelo Ball
"idk it's pretty common for players to develop later. he's the current exception but there's one on every team. Pat Bev, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton, Marcus was considered worse than Markieff for a good while, Seth Curry, Spencer Dinwiddie, most teams have a guy who developed late and became a productive member of a playoff team. There's lots of routes in the nba and late bloomers for sure exist."
I bet you love when Kyle Lowry does it though

"I know, I think that's high. I'm saying the deal could be 20m for Lowry per year and the trade still works. Depends on what deal Kyle agrees to, but I'd imagine he'd accept around 20-22m."
NBA Doctor Kyle Champion Lowry
"&gt; Works financially if Kyle Lowry agrees to a sign and trade worth 3 years, $100m  You should be asking if the Sixers would agree to that lol"

"This is the problem with r/nba that people say dumb shit and don‚Äôt get checked for it. We HAD bad player development because of Luke Walton‚Äôs staff. Now we have had for the last two years the best development coach in all of basketball in Phil Handy. Look at the Kings under Walton and you see their young talent hasn‚Äôt quite reached potential, and then look at how literally every NBA player works with Phil Handy. He has been an assistant coach on Nick Nurse‚Äôs staff, Tyronn Lue‚Äôs staff, and Frank Vogel‚Äôs staff. He has and still works with guys like Kawhi, Lebron, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Pascal Siakam, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Spencer Dinwiddie, and countless others that all have sung praises about him. There‚Äôs a reason why Steve Nash wanted him on his staff this past offseason and the Wizards were interviewing him for the job this offseason."
"Kyle Lowry would be the top FA in pacers franchise history.  Given that indys GM bungled the Hayward signing last year because he didn‚Äôt want to give up Victor Oladipo, I can 100% buy that he‚Äôd miss this opportunity as well.  I can also 100% buy that Indy fans are going to defend their GMs honor on reddit after he misses yet another opportunity to get them past the first round. They are already doing it preemptively"

"whys it so hard to believe? that is what has been reported multiple times  people have no problem believing the bs sixers rumored ask lmao. contrary to popular belief the asking prices werent crazy  ill leave this here https://theathletic.com/2477311/2021/03/25/what-the-lakers-were-willing-to-trade-for-kyle-lowry-and-what-it-says-about-the-future/. actual reputable sources for one  &gt; Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles‚Äô starting backcourt, Dennis Schr√∂der and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.   &gt; The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers‚Äô vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers in his second season.   &gt; The Lakers‚Äô willingness to include Schr√∂der and Caldwell-Pope is revealing."
NBA Champion Dr. Kyle Lowry
Lol none of that bothers me in the slightest. Y‚Äôall are delusional as fuck. Kyle and the rest were dogmeat me EVERY year in the playoffs till Kawhi put the team on his back. Those are facts.  Lowry gonna leave and y‚Äôall getting little to nothing. Be sure to show up in the thread when it happens with that same energy so I can say I told you so.
"If this article is true, put a big red X through Kyle Lowry. I'm not all that hype on Lowry anyway. But that would be Daryl getting robbed, and I don't think that's going to happen."
"Simmons is also not really the right personality for Philly. He is kind of passive and more of a shoulder shrug type guy that just is gonna keep pissing off the Philly fans. The trade is strange because Simmons is losing trade value for Philly because there is no way to convince the fans that just running it back is gonna be a good idea after the way they went out in the playoffs, but at the same time Simmons received an MVP vote last year so you can't just let him go just to shake it up. Simmons probably NEEDS to leave but the Sixers probably aren't getting equal value back unless it is multiple trades.   Here is the trade idea I have seen kicked around the Wolves sub.   Raptors-Wolves-Sixers.  Raptors get Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio  Wolves get Simmons and Baynes.   Sixers get Malik Beasley, Kyle Lowry and 2 Wolves 1sts.   Raptors do it to get the veteran leader in Rubio to come in and hopefully mentor Suggs (Mitchell and Edwards have both raved about how good Rubio is at helping them get up to NBA speed), also as an expiring they can restock next year they can possibly flip him. They get a super team friendly contract in Naz who has shown flashes and they get to not play Baynes anymore. Giving up Lowry is just a S+T so the cost to them is minimal to be part of the trade.   Wolves get their guy in Simmons, take on the Baynes contract and maybe he can show better here than he did in his disaster season in Tampa.   Sixers get a real PG that they can trust to take big shots and they get a knockdown shooter to help create space for Embiid. Curry doesn't need to be the only threat beyond the arc if they add Beasley. The 2 1st can be packaged together with some of the Sixers other assets or picks if they decide they need to make another run at a star like Beal."
"I mean they‚Äôre at ~99.9% I feel like that‚Äôs just splitting hairs, and tbf Kyle Lowry has just as many all stars as Dame plus better longevity. I‚Äôd agree though and say it‚Äôs too high on Lowry and definitely not perfect, however it‚Äôs good enough for me and it‚Äôs seems pretty confident (90%!) that Dame will be a HOFer. Which is probably the easiest HOF in the 4 major sports"
That doesn't have anything to do with what I said. Embiid is already and MVP level player &amp; would've got it if he didn't get injured this season. If Embiid gets an MVP it's going to be because of Embiid not Kyle Lowry lol
"You wouldn't be saying that if you guys had won the title. Which you would have if you acquired Kyle Lowry, by the way."
"Jrue is going to be playing a lot on this team. Perimeter defense was disgusting. Last olympics we had Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Klay, and prime Draymond on D."
Kyle Lowry would be a big help
https://www.gettyimages.ch/detail/nachrichtenfoto/gary-payton-of-the-miami-heat-drives-around-kyle-lowry-nachrichtenfoto/72231927?adppopup=true  found it after 20 min  couldnt find it on google and had to resort to searching on getty images lol
"You're right, a team has to be perfectly healthy in order to capitalize on other teams' playoff injuries.  Oh wait.  https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1130256360900141056?s=20  https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-thumb-injury-1.5147123  https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-og-anunoby-undergoes-emergency-appendectomy/"
No one would likely take the version of Kyle Lowry 5 years in the future when he's 40 over Curry.
I‚Äôm shocked people can‚Äôt see how Lowry would elevate the play of everyone on the 76ers and are arguing for a one dimensional shooter.   Seth is a nice piece but Kyle Lowry elevates the game of everyone around him. I don‚Äôt think ppl understand how well he would fit alongside Joel Embiid.
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
"Lol ok, he *can* sign the MLE, but he *won‚Äôt*, and for that reason it‚Äôs completely out of the question and impossible.   Kyle Lowry is not that kind of guy, he‚Äôs said what he expects to make.  He‚Äôs said he wants to be valued, straight up."
"Ah yes. Kyle Lowry, who notoriously doesn‚Äôt workout or take care of his body. Kyle Lowry who notoriously needs to be told to get in the gym, who isn‚Äôt there before everyone else working longer than everyone else.   Kyle Lowry, notoriously out of shape and unable to play the most minutes per game out of anyone on his team at age 35."
"6‚Äô1 190lbs is definitely on the smaller side of PG‚Äôs.   And the fact he significantly added mass means he likely isn‚Äôt going to get much bigger. Pretty sure he was measured at 6‚Äô0.5 and the Cavs list him at 6‚Äô1 so no real reason to assume he is taller now either.   He isn‚Äôt the smallest PG, and there are guys smaller than him but Kyle Lowry for example is considered an undersized PG and he is 6‚Äô0 196 lbs and a lot bulkier than Garland."
"Not to mention he‚Äôs reliant on others creating shots for him. His hot shooting is all catch and shoot.   Lowry creates for others and he can also shoot 35%+++ on pull up 3‚Äôs.  There‚Äôs nothing better than a Kyle Lowry pull up transition 3, just a dagger in the heart for the other team I‚Äôve seen it a thousand times."
Kyle Lowry knows his worth.  He‚Äôs not taking a team friendly deal anywhere.
"And CP3 is paid $10mil more; and is about to sign a contract extension reported at 3yr/$100mil.   And I hate to be this person, but at THIS POINT in their careers, Kyle Lowry and CP3 are much more similar than most people will give Lowry credit for. I see what CP3 does, and Lowry has the same impact and has better defense."
The Heat with their whole core + Lowry is closer to a contender than a Sixers team + Lowry that had to give up Seth+Maxey/Thybulle to get him.   The Heat are more than a Kyle Lowry away from being contenders but so are the Sixers.
"Who said I don‚Äôt want him anymore lmfao.   I‚Äôd actually rather Kyle Lowry stay in Toronto. I‚Äôm happy to give him 3 years $20-25 mil per year to finish his career here.   If he wants to go elsewhere to chase a ring, that‚Äôs fine with me too.  But i want him to stay"
They're way more than a Kyle Lowry away from being contenders lmao. Lowry ain't Jesus
So you selling me on a player you don't want anymore?üòÇü§£  Never change Raptors fans never change. Kyle Lowry must be CP3 2.0 the way you talk him up.
As good as Kyle Lowry is I wouldn‚Äôt do all that.
You‚Äôd be in the NBA finals if you had Kyle Lowry on the court instead of Ben Simmons.
Imagine thinking Kyle Lowry will solve our problems?  We need a go to scorer more than anything. Somebody who can take pressure off Embiid in the playoffs.  Is Lowry that? I think not. We won't overpay for a 35 year old pg.
"76ers shafted themselves, the loss of Seth Curry, their only consistent shooter far hurts more than the gain of Kyle Lowry"

"Okay, but Kyle Lowry probably is. There‚Äôs no one immediately behind or ahead of him who‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a great indicator still and Kyle Lowry is not the exception."
"and to be fair our entire defense was focussed on stopping him, and our defense consisted of kyle lowry, kawhi leonard, siakam and marc gasol. thats a lot of defensive talent"
"Kyle Lowry is making the hall of fame and getting a statue in Toronto. Voters love Lowrys career, play style and story. He‚Äôs getting in"
kyle lowry turned into a hall of famer from the 2nd half of his career
its true but jae is like kyle lowry in that even if he's having a bad shooting game he brings it everywhere else on the court
Kyle Lowry begs to differ
Signing Kyle Lowry would be a great start.
Kyle Lowry and two 2nd round picks
Kyle Lowry
Edited my comment. I don‚Äôt want to slander billups. The post wince carter era was dark. I had an Afro and wore Ben Wallace jersey everywhere. Thrilled when they won. I‚Äôve just watched a lot of Lowry games and feel he could slide right onto that pistons team and get the same results. Similar range and poise offensively while playing superior defender to Chauncey. Thing is that pistons team was just better built than anything Kyle went to postseason with not including 2019. Slight edge over 2020 raptors who missed the ECF by a tiny margin after losing home court and pascal siakams basketball abilities due to the bubble.
"I'll give you Kyle Lowry then.  An 18pt/7ast, 42FG% guy who had a teammate for better HoF eilgibility is no superstar, though."
I hate making comparisons like this but Kyle Lowry I guess? That‚Äôs probably the best comparison I can give you off the top of my head.
"To me, vets are generally the guys who've been on a squad for a while as well as in the league for a while. Fred and Pascal play that role for the Raptors if Kyle Lowry isn't back next year. Danny Green was an excellent vet in his year in Toronto."
Ya last olympics(?) Kyle Lowry was looking like the best part of that team even though he‚Äôs on the floor with top 50 all-timers cause he was the only guy not looking for a shot so a lot of the offence was flowing through him.
Kyle Lowry would have been magic. His leadership and his playmaking.
Should have tried Kyle Lowry or maybe mike Conley if he was available.
This only fuels my desire to see Kyle Lowry up close
"Kyle Lowry would‚Äôve been a good addition - he can create shots for others, provides veteran leadership, plays defense and has a gold medal and a championship. And he wouldn‚Äôt need a lot of minutes or a lot of shots."
USA would‚Äôve won if they traded for Kyle Lowry üò§
"We don't have an elite playmaker on this team. Bunch of guys who are iso players. We need a Steph, Lebron, CP3, Harden, or even a guy like Kyle Lowry who can set up guys to take shots."
Hawks? Raptors? Who was the best players they had? Kyle Lowry? DeRozan? Horford? Lol!!!!
"That Rockets team was so good. Took them to 7 without T-Mac or Yao (well I guess Yao played in one of their wins). Fully healthy that Rockets team was definitely the best team in the league that year and even with just a healthy Yao they were probably good enough to win the title. Yao always played Dwight tough.  Aaron Brooks, Kyle Lowry, Scola, Battier, Artest, Carl Landy and Chuck Hayes. Even had old man Mutumbo until he got hurt in the Portland series."
"Ah yes, Kyle Lowry a man known for never having frequent single game disappearing acts in the playoffs. The model of consistency. Jrue should be more like him!"
Kyle Lowry ass cheeks are 300lbs each
Kyle Lowry
"westbrook, chris paul  kyle lowry , dwane wade ( not a pg but a guard) Unless ur talking about the average joe who arent that good to begin with."
I would assume raptors. Kyle Lowry made it seem like he wanted out of Toronto at the deadline and the 76ers were the main destination
I would swap Brandon Ingram with Russel Westbrook. Then I would move Ben Simmons down to tier 8 while moving up Pascal Siakam into tier 6 and SGA into tier 7. Finally I would swap Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry.
"Terrence Ross over Jonathan Isaac, Julius Randle over Derrick Rose and Pascal Siakam over Kyle Lowry. The other 27 I agree with."
"This is a real shot in the dark, but I could see a 3-team trade where DLO goes to OKC with a pick or two attached and Kemba goes to philly. Kemba would be a perfect fit for Philly considering they can cover his bad defense better than pretty much any other team, and OKC is in full asset collection mode making this a perfect match imo. Also, all the contracts line up perfectly (I think Minny has to send an extra couple mil which shouldn‚Äôt be hard with some minimum guys).  I could also see a similar construction using Toronto in a Kyle Lowry sign and trade as the matching salary. Either of these trades seem very likely now that I think about it."
Kyle Lowry S&amp;T maybe
Team up with Kyle Lowry and join the Mavs.
I think even just a Jamal Murray / Kyle Lowry level player would be enough for the Bucks as an upgrade over KMid
Kyle Lowry
"Look at Lowry‚Äôs playoff stats the last 6 years, 1 bad postseason (by his standards) every other one he‚Äôs been consistent Kyle Lowry."
"Yes, Kyle Lowry is miles better than Jrue Holiday"
"https://youtu.be/9QJ8eTP7fKY  They did soft hedges which was similar to what Durant got. This is also with Kyle Lowry and FVV on him instead of PJ, Middleton, and Giannis.   Not to mention the amount of easy buckets he got from Draymond. Implying that that game was more impressive than Kds is nonsense."
Kyle Lowry is off the board? What did I miss?
"Once again, if they can send an expiring Dragic with a young prospect like Achiwua to one of the teams with over $35M in cap (see: OKC, NYK, SA)‚Ä¶ they will be able to afford Kyle Lowry."
I addressed the fact that last year was a down year for Dragic in my comment but go off. $20M is the going rate for a quality starting guard in today‚Äôs NBA. 35 year old Kyle Lowry is about to get $30M for multiple years and his numbers aren‚Äôt that far off from what you listed (Not saying they share the same impact).
Yeah because Free agents would want to come flocking to LA because of Kyle lowry lmao. Westbrook brings that superstar status that Lowry will never have and Russ is miles better. Lowry is only better at shooting and flopping and hes breaking down and will be 36 next season. It's why they are a superteam with Russ and not Lowry.
Kyle Lowry is easily better
"Wow so it‚Äôs actually true?   Kyle Lowry has never beaten a team whose best player is better than Dame that‚Äôs wild   He beat a 22 year old Giannis, and a 34 year old DWade that‚Äôs the 2 best players   That‚Äôs fucking crazy   And he did go against PG, as the clear second option on his team."
Because Russ is a more talented player   If Russ was on that Toronto team instead of Lowry they make the ECF prob   Would‚Äôve had a better chance against Bron if you replace Kyle with Russ for those years as well

Kyle Lowry simply because he could spread the floor while posting a nice +-
You mean how it references a Post article labeled ‚ÄúKnicks targeting Chris Paul Kyle Lowry in Free Agency‚Äù?
"The source is Marc Berman from the New York Post.  &gt; The most likely Knicks catch would be Lakers point guard Dennis Schroder, a solid defender and playmaker who may be expendable now that the Lakers have landed Russell Westbrook. The Knicks scouted Schroder intensely this season to make sure the German native is a fit for coach Tom Thibodeau.    https://nypost.com/2021/08/01/knicks-targeting-chris-paul-kyle-lowry-in-free-agency/"
Yes. You can‚Äôt talk to a player that isn‚Äôt under contract prior to free agency. Unless youre Toronto and Miami I guess. They are currently tampering the fuck out of Kyle Lowry.
"No idea how you can say he isn‚Äôt a starter anymore. He was legitimately good pre-All Star break and if you don‚Äôt think he can play a comparable role to Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley (when healthy) I don‚Äôt know what to say to you.  He‚Äôs obviously not an All-Star, at least not last year, for sure, but that‚Äôs the meaning of fringe."
"https://theathletic.com/2478518/2021/03/26/why-no-kyle-lowry-trade-got-done-and-a-closer-look-at-the-ones-that-did-amicks-nba-trade-deadline-reflections/  doesnt directly say that but it does say it was over draft compensation  &gt; As for Philadelphia, which was reportedly close to a Lowry deal but wound up opting for Oklahoma City‚Äôs George Hill instead, a source with knowledge of the talks said the Raptors indeed believed they were very close on that front late in the process and that the draft compensation was the final unresolved hurdle. The plan, the source said, was for Toronto to re-route Sixers guard Danny Green to a third team."
"what if miami is talking to toronto saying ""would you be open to a sign and trade for lowry, and we'll sign and trade dragic""   are miami and toronto allowed to talk? because then toronto can talk to lowry who isn't a free agent until free agency starts, and say ""buddy, we want to sign and trade you to someone, would you be ok doing that for us?"" and they don't need to mention the name, but kyle can read woj's twitter and figure it out and say yeah sure  how is any of that against the rules?"
They cannot.  Kyle Lowry is a FA atm.  Which means anything involving him is off limits.
Kyle Lowry isn't average lol.  The 35yr old they're talking about in this instance is Dragic
Kyle Lowry I believe
You better not be disrespecting Kyle mufuckin Lowry
The Miami heat are planning on giving Kyle Lowry a call for the first time tomorrow afternoon
&gt;Miami can open $27 mil of space and just sign Kyle.  I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't enough for Lowry. Ageing stars **should** be getting reduced contracts but teams have shown a willingness to overpay in recent years.   They might need +30m for him.
what could have been a great duo in new orleans. kyle lowry and gumbo
&gt;The Dallas Mavericks are a team to watch as a suitor for Goran Dragic after the Kyle Lowry sign-and-trade but only after free agency starts because otherwise it's tampering  FTFY
Kyle Lowry as a free agent is a more valuable trade asset than DeRozan on a contract lol
Dudes are really crying about a Kyle Lowry &amp; Goran Dragic deal   üíÄüíÄ
How about that Kyle Lowry guy. He seems good
Kyle lowry rly has the best narrative for himself after that ring lol
Kyle Lowry is a nba champion and strong
Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt exist! Half the players in the league are made up
Kyle Lowry about to get extra thicc in Miami
"&gt; Lowry has long been intrigued with joining Heat star Jimmy Butler and the Miami organization, and now Miami has maneuvered to have two key elements of a possible sign-and-trade package -- guard Goran Dragic and forward Precious Achiuwa -- to offer the Raptors once talks can ensue at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, sources said.  &gt; The Heat picked up the option on Dragic's $19.4 million contract for the 2021-2022 season, making him an ideal contractual fit to include in talks to make a deal possible with the Raptors. A market exists for the Raptors to move Dragic, 35, onto a new team, including the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans, sources said.  &gt; Achiuwa, a well-regarded 2020 first-round pick out of the University of Memphis, showed significant promise in his rookie season and would serve as a sweetener to Toronto to facilitate a sign-and-trade deal, sources said. Miami could add draft assets to a package, too.  Getting Precious, picks, and whatever we get for re-routing Dragic would be a fantastic return for Kyle in a S&amp;T. Keeps our cap space open while also getting some big depth"
"Can anyone provide a rational reason why the Pelicans wouldn't match? Lonzo had a good season for them, has a high bball IQ and his shooting is trending in the right direction.   I'm the biggest Kyle Lowry fan you'll find but I can't understand passing on a young franchise lead guard for an aging one, likely at an inflated price? Is there someone else on the Pelicans' radar for lead guard? Is Kira Lewis getting a promotion?"
"He's only 34  I'm actually genuinely surprised he's younger than Kyle Lowry. I always imagined Gay being the ""older bro"" in their friendship"
"Can a Pels fan tell me why they would rather apparently have 35 year old Kyle Lowry at 3x30 instead of Lonzo at 4x20? Those numbers don't add up, and Lowry has to be one of the most likely players to become washed in the next 3 years. Seems like a no-brainer unless they really don't like Lonzo"
no he's coming to miami to play with his bestest friend in the whole world kyle lowry
"Kyle Lowry. He wouldn‚Äôt be enough to make us a championship caliber team, but he would be enough to elevate us to a WCF caliber team.   Unfortunately for us it sounds like that ain‚Äôt happening"
"Damn forgot  But then again, the roster past Lavine and Vuc is just garbage, besides *maybe* markkanen, I know it's hillariously obvious but they need a true star playmaker, hell, not even CP3, Kyle Lowry would be more then enough"
You right. Typed last year for Kyle. It‚Äôs 15/5/6 for Lowry. But point remains.  Higher efg. Way better offensively. Still high end defender his whole career. And second to third option. Not fourth.
Kyle Lowry starts phoning it in after receiving a huge contract from the Pelicans
I think it is in the Pelicans best interest to just build with their young squad. Even if the Pelicans get Kyle Lowry they will still be an average team at best and and Lowry is already 35 years old.
there's a long list beyond kyle lowry of players the Pelicans can get who would be better than lonzo at 25mil/yr
Oh? It's 36 year old Kyle Lowry who's going to retire before my rookie extension even kicks in...?  Ggggrrreeeeeeaaaaattttt.....
Kyle Lowry come on down
"He‚Äôs drafted one point guard at 13 who was the best on the board who has only been a backup so far. Pursuing Kyle Lowry, who is clearly a better and much more established player than Lonzo, a multi time allstar and nba champion, is hardly disrespectful. Moving Lonzo off ball is probably best for his skill set and his career TBH considering he‚Äôs a weak ballhandler as a primary one and can‚Äôt get the hold or take guys off the dribble. None of those things are disrespectful."
"Kyle Lowry is the big domino that decides it all. If he goes to Miami then they can‚Äôt resign Dragic, and they won‚Äôt be able to sign THJ. If Lowry goes to NO then they won‚Äôt be able to resign Lonzo. If Lowry goes to Dallas then THJ is going to Miami. It‚Äôll be an interesting week for sure"
"OP was making the point that shooting poorly pre-NBA is clear evidence they wont shoot well in the NBA. Just because they shot poorly pre-NBA doesnt mean they cant develop a shot in the NBA and came off with the tone that ""it should be obvious.""  For example, Kyle Lowry shot 36% from the field his rookie season (yes I understand Lowry also wasn't a Reddish style HS recruit)  I'm not saying Cam is going to live up to his HS hype of being a future star or anything, but I think there are solid reasonings many people think he'll be a solid NBA player beyond the current struggles or why he shouldnt immediately be written off.  Terrence Ross is another example - he wasn't as highly rated as Reddish was, but by all accounts he was a top 30 HS recruit, had a bad freshman year in college, was a top 10 pick in the draft, and had a pretty terrible first couple years in the NBA. But most people consider him a solid NBA role player at the moment."
Sure he does. I‚Äôm sure he would also like to play next to Kyle Lowry. Both those things could be true.
"I agree that teaming up with Jimmy is probably a factor for Kyle but nobody is ""overlooking"" Lowry to Miami it's literally one of the most oft-mentioned potential destinations for him lol"
"The league changes so quickly.  Ben Simmons has a poisonous contract that scares most fan bases.  It‚Äôs like a 4 year contract though.  When he has a good season this year, we might all change our mind.  Kyle Lowry is so old.  He‚Äôs probably the most coveted free agent this offseason.  If he starts to have a bad season, his contract will suddenly be terrible!  Mike Conley had a terrible contract before and Chris Paul!  And now they‚Äôre highly coveted!  It makes you wonder what will happen with guys like Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Al Horford.  The players are people and people can change, they can fully return from injury, fit in a better system, improve, etc. and we all just have to react to it and change our perception"
"Report: Lakers also have ‚Äòstrong interest‚Äô in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, and the Statue of Liberty."
He looks like steph curry n Kyle Lowry at times the last 2 Olympics
"i think we're all in agreement here that they're both bad fits. the difference is DeMar knows his place and will make better decisions, both in passing and scoring situations. way less sloppy of a player. DeRozan was about 60%TS as an inside the 3 point line scorer on a team with ZERO good shooters. not one. Patty sucked for 75% of the season and Lonnie is one of the most inconsistent shooters I've ever seen.   The Lakers have the defenders to make up for either players deficiencies on that end, but I'd rather have 59%ts than 51%. DeMar is also a better cutter than Russ, which shouldn't be the case, but it has been so far. that's part of why he played well with Kyle Lowry."
"The Pelicans are desperately trying not to fumble Zion and in the process are fumbling Zion.   Do you think that in four years when Zion is a RFA he‚Äôs going to gladly sign a max extension to play with the corpse of fucking Kyle Lowry? No, fuck no.   I‚Äôm not saying Zo is the move but Jesus don‚Äôt tie your future star to these must win now Vets that are on the wrong side of thirty. You have assets make a move for a younger guy and make sure you have the pieces to make them all happy."
i'm just glad things are more clear now.   our goal: get kyle lowry  backup plan: match zo.   i'm more on the matching zo side. considering lowry is now 35. but at least there's some clarity knowing we at least have a backup plan if we fail to go all out on lowry
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan easily in the Top 5 Friendships in NBA History, that alone deserves a spot on the list.  Stats there are off the charts.  Serious answer:  Curry, LeBron, Kawhi, Giannis, Kyrie are easy locks."
How much cap space do y‚Äôall have? I very highly doubt Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt interested in winning anymore.
I'd be hyped to have Kyle.  I think Lowry could have a really positive influence on this team. We've lost so many games in the fourth quarter and having a leader like him to help BI/Zion would be absolutely amazing.
"I feel like I have been defending him on reddit for the past few weeks but here's the deal: he used to write features on NBA people for SI, and in that process writer spends time with his subject to get to know him, he said in his AMA he had drinks with Nick Nurse, for example, [and then wrote this story on him](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/10/25/raptors-nick-nurse-kawhi-leonard-masai-ujiri-kyle-lowry).  And he wrote a book about tanking where he interview bunch of NBA people. He obviously has NBA connections and is not making stuff up like Scoop B does.   I'm not saying he's Woj/ Shams tier, but he just started as a reporter and was first on Grizzlies/ Pelicans trade, Raptors drafting Barnes and bunch of news on assistant coaches hiring."
"Kyle Lowry still won and proved he is a winner, tbh not just Lowry but I would also take Jrue Holiday and Rondo over CP0 because they can actually win when it matters"
Trae Young   Steph Curry   Damian Lillard   Jrue Holiday   Kyle Lowry    *Their rain of threes shall blot out the sun*
"Kyle Lowry went 2/9 in a finals game and won, went 4/13 in game 7 vs Philly and won  Carried by Kawhi lmao, he is not even in the same stratosphere as CP3"
"show everyone hes the ultimate choker, he had a free path to the finals facing 3 straight injured teams which all would have beaten him if they were healthy and then he takes a 2-0 lead in the finals and still choked to a injured Giannis  This is why Kyle Lowry &gt; CP0"
"For a star player? Solo shot creation. Luka, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, all do it at historically great levels.  The reason why Shai is so good at such a young age is that he's lowkey one of the best solo shot creators in the NBA. It's also the reason the Raptors struggle; the only ""solo shot creators"" we have are Kyle Lowry and Gary Trent Jr., the former of which is likely gone and the latter of which hasn't really grown into his skillset yet."
You're right. [Kyle](https://sports.yahoo.com/jimmy-butler-reveals-that-kyle-lowry-is-his-daughters-godfather-175331921.html) is Jimmy's daughter's godfather lol
"Yeah, but the 20-21 season was Lowry's worst in about a decade. Don't really want to trade your 2nd best player for a ~$30m/year aging star if he's on the decline.   I became fan of Lowry during the 2019 playoff run, but idk if I'd like him on the Mavs for what we'll probably have to pay him.  For reference    20-21 Season | P/36 | A/36 | R/36 | TS% | OWS | DWS | WS | VORP ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|--- Tim Hardaway Jr| **21.1**| 2.3 | **4.2** | 58.9% | **3.2** | **1.2** | **4.3** | 1.1 Kyle Lowry | 17.8| **7.6**(!) |1.0 | **59.3%**| 2.9 | 1.3 | 4.1|**1.3**  Hard to say how each will change next season, but the biggest advantage Lowry over THJ is playmaking, which you can see by the big difference in assists. If we get him, I guess time will tell if the price is worth it.  Also, Mavs have a pretty shit history in free agency, so I may just be jaded as fuck."
"Here is the excerpt from the article, exactly the same as OP posted. Now please go and give me the podcast word for word rather than from your recollection.  &gt; There is some beautiful-mind framework in which the Lakers might still sign-and-trade Schroder and acquire Hield. It's just hard to find it. The Wizards and Kings don't want Schroder, sources said. The Lakers would need a fourth team that does, with assets the Kings want. (The Lakers do avoid the hard cap here by not acquiring a player in a sign-and-trade -- one reason DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry were likely off the board.)  &gt; A lot of teams with a need at point guard have cap space to sign Schroder (or some alternative) outright; they don't need to help the Lakers.  &gt; If Hield is out of the picture, the Lakers can and will try to turn Schroder into one or two other players -- though that requires Schroder's cooperation. It would be nice if one of those players could shoot 3s."
Give Kyle Lowry plz (after he agrees to come here)
"&gt;Masai TRADED Lowry for trash garbage! The deal was done, it took a miracle from Dolan saving the Raptors collective asses by vetoing the trade because he's a complete moron.  Shit wasn't it a 2018 first round pick, we might have gotten Zion knowing the Knicks luck.  Kyle was a free agent after the season so he could have walked anyway.  &gt;Masai let PJ Tucker walk and used the cap money to make a big splash on DeMarre Carroll who was fucking useless overpaid trash.  Carroll was signed in 2015.  Tucker was traded for in 2017."
"Lowry/Zion/BI/Jonas are a really nice fit, IMO. That's a lot of guys Lowry can get the ball to---but who also can go out and also create for themselves and others.  We also have some young playmakers who'd soak up knowledge from a vet PG.  These were kids who got LOTS of advice from Nicolo Melli and Eric Bledsoe last season. Kyle Lowry would be a great vet to ask questions too instead lol."
Kyle Lowry
"Before the draft I was leaning heavy on the idea of the Warriors package (Wiggins, Wiseman, 7 and 14) for Siakam. I feel like that‚Äôs something that benefits all parties. Warriors get their third star, who also happens to be a positional fit/need on the team and can play lock down defense. Maybe they‚Äôd regret dumping Wiseman down the line but if Siakam is a big piece that helps this team win playoff games and series it would have been worth it.  Raptors get an opportunity for a jump started rebuild as Kyle Lowry most likely leaves this offseason. Three lottery picks in a deep draft is a dream come true for most teams. Wiseman is a great developmental piece at a position the Raptors desperately needed filled long term. And Wiggins is wing depth that allows Scottie/OG to play more at the 4, which is where I think they‚Äôll both thrive."
Whoever gives Kyle Lowry 3 years at big money is going to regret it.  Dude has already been regressing hard the last two years.  He's MFing 35 already.
Kyle Lowry trying to crawl through that one dude's legs
Not his regular shot but Kyle Lowry has yeeted the ball overhead style multiple times and it always seems to find its way in..https://youtu.be/a6ghC1dd2Eo
The Sixers are title contenders if they add [Kyle Fucking Lowry](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTU1JT_ZdYA2ZODPj1415nGyKYbqwp5icioxA&amp;usqp=CAU) you utter fucking oaf
It'd be nice to have a PG. I think Lowry/BI/Zion would be a cool trio.  We blew 14 games in the fourth quarter where we had leads. Kyle would be a good influence on this young team too...
"Josh Primo is a top 10 guy in this draft, Kuminga is the best player from this draft, Bouknight becomes a superstar, and McBride is the next Kyle Lowry"
"the heat are interested in every free agent  i dont know how they will pay bam, jimmy b, herro, duncan, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie, bradley beal, pascal siakam, and kawhi leonard but ive been wrong before"
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"
Steph  Klay  Kawhi  KD  Anthony Davis   Chris Paul Kyle Lowry  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Bam   Zion  Booker
He‚Äôs 6‚Äô0 I believe he even said so when he was interviewed at the draft last night. I think Baylor has him listed at 6‚Äô2‚Äù on their roster but colleges lie about that stuff all the time. I‚Äôd be very weary of his measurements and age not saying it‚Äôs impossible but guys like Kyle Lowry are pretty rare when it comes to being good defenders at that size and arm length.
Oh absolutely. I‚Äôm very high Scottie to Toronto. That front court of OG and Scottie might be insane. I think Jalen Suggs was better because I‚Äôm sure if the Raptors are still willing to keep Kyle Lowry
Man we are chasing Kyle Lowry?? God the Mavs suck lol
"Point being that Siakam with a lower usage rate averaged 10 more ppg per game than Ibaka, and 4 more than Lowry.  Closed out Game 6 at Oracle with a dagger over Draymond and 26-10, the second leading scorer in the game after Klay.   Him and Lowry roughly equal in minutes. He was undoubtedly the second offensive option which doesn't take anything away from Kyle, who was absolutely the engine of the team.   Kawhi missed too many games in 2020. AD was listed where he was listed, so it's a moot point."
"Kyle Lowry is 6 nothing. He's known for his defense and he was a leader for a championship team. But yea, going to be interesting how this looks."
"Depending on how the Ben Simmons and Kyle Lowry situations go in Philly, I think a Buddy Hield and Delon Wright for Tobias Harris structure might make some sense."
"I think I'd rather Conley than any of the other PGs in this class. Dinwiddie feels like a league average starting guard who's going to get overpaid, and Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry are both much older than Conley."
whenever i watched him play in college i always thought he was kyle lowry if he was 6‚Äô9.
&gt; you never know what that future is gonna bring.  He states completely obliviously while implying that somehow the sixers are title contenders if they add Kyle fucking Lowry
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards‚Äô season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  ‚ÄúThis is not a run-it-back team,‚Äù he said.  Now, it‚Äôs official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday‚Äôs NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won‚Äôt become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook‚Äôs outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose r√©sum√© includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he‚Äôs done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team‚Äôs culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal‚Äôs closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards‚Äô preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what‚Äôs now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming ‚Äî especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie‚Äôs incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn‚Äôt all. The Wizards‚Äô Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards‚Äô list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer‚Äôs free agency class is rich with capable point guards ‚Äî from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte‚Äô Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it‚Äôs confusing, but that‚Äôs not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They‚Äôre adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford ‚Äî though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it‚Äôs difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
I also read Kyle Lowry and Demar are signing on vet minimum contracts. Lakers 10 peat?üò±üò±
Lol I still don‚Äôt get it. Suggs would have been the perfect replacement to Kyle Lowry
"&gt;On the 2nd part, Kyle Lowry was the #2 best players, and Brown is not better than him. Pascal that Finals was arguably better than Brown too considering he played against Draymond.  Oof.  &gt;Brown hasn‚Äôt proven anything as an individual player against real competition in the playoffs.  Double oof."
"The ppg is a worthless point because of space, pace and weak defenses today. Record # of 20 ppg scorers even compared to just 8 years ago.  Also this regular season is impossible to accurately grade players on an all time ranking list based on unusual circumstances (COVID protocols, empty stadiums, injuries were historic, etc).  On the 2nd part, Kyle Lowry was the #2 best players, and Brown is not better than him. Pascal that Finals was arguably better than Brown too considering he played against Draymond.   Only ones he‚Äôs definitively better than are Parker &amp; Jet, so I‚Äôll give you that. Still disengenous when people here always compare teams to the 14 Spurs like that insane run will ever be replicated again. Even comparing to the 11 Mavs is bold considering Caron was their 2nd best the entire year but got hurt and someone like Tyson Chandler was more impactful (compare Brown tk them). Even tho I agree Brown &gt; Jet, 2011 Playoffs Jet is a contest; Brown hasn‚Äôt proven anything as an individual player against real competition in the playoffs.  When you‚Äôre buildin your team around prime Bron, sure, Brown can be a #2 and possibly win‚Ä¶. But not behind just Tatum as the #1 in an era dominated by superteams. Brown wouldn‚Äôt be 2nd best on top tier contenders like the Nets, Lakers, Clippers or even Bucks."
Philly got their Kyle Lowry stand in
So guess that advertisement is exclusive to Kyle Lowry
TIL the best Shaq comparison in the modern NBA is Kyle Lowry.
"if you followed the build up to the draft. I believe the raptors wanted to trade down and draft barnes and get assests. However magic, knew that and since deal wasn't with them. They said they were big on taking barnes 5th. Meaning there no where raptors could trade too, to take barnes.  This on top of his Great workouts, good defensive frame moved him up the draft. Personally i think this means raptors are going after ben simmions for a PG or SGA, or keeping kyle lowry.  HoweverPascal, OG, Bocuher, Barnes, Vanvleet is a lot of defensive bodies."
"idk theres literally no other difference between Kyle Lowry and Lonzo Ball as players, body types, etc so its really hard to tell"
"So has Kyle Lowry, doesnt mean he isnt still chasing the bag"
"Raps got their next Kyle Lowry, it just wasn't Suggs. That being said I would have loved suggs as well"
I am going to say Kyle Lowry because of how little some fans seem to think of him.
"A significant amount, for someone like Kyle Lowry I think if he didn't have the ring then he wouldn't be close to the HOF but with it I think it makes his resume look a lot more HOF worthy, not saying he's a lock of course"
"Jimmy recovers his jump shot and shoots 38% from 3, Tyler Herro improves and wins 6th man of the year. Bam averages 22/10/6 and wins DPOY. Duncan Robinson improves into a good defender and shoots 45%+ from 3. Markieff Morris starts playing like his brother. Kyle Lowry and PJ Tucker turn back the clock.    We have the best defense in the league. We beat the Bucks and face the Nets in the conference finals. James Harden chokes against us like in 2012 because of our strip clubs, and we make it to the finals where we beat the Lakers who are not as good as people expect them to be.   The nets big three take the hardest road and all join the Heat in the off-season for assets and we have a dynasty on our hands."
Maxey better be Allen Iverson 2.0  Because Sixers fans mostly didn't want to include him in trades for James Harden and Kyle Lowry
Sacrilegious to forget current great Kyle Lowry
"Yuta Wantanabe wins MIP , Scottie Barnes wins DPOY,  Kyle wins mvp on the heat and we meet in the conference finals. Goes to 7 games and game 7 goes into 10 overtimes. FVV wins with a 3 at the buzzer when we are down by 2 and then goes over to hug a crying Kyle Lowry, but removes his mask and it turns out he was Kyle Lowry all year, and Miami Kyle is actually mvp Freddy. They kiss as the screen fades to black. They don‚Äôt bother playing the finals"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/toronto-raptors-nba-finals-kyle-lowry-game-6%3famp=1  Kawhi was probably the game changer that Toronto needed to win it all, but Lowry was the recognized leader, not just that year but every year prior the Raptors made it to the playoffs.  They complemented each other really well, the stoic Kawhi and floor general Lowry."
"Everyone knows we're not going to the Finals, heck maybe not even the second round. Is everything just about winning the whole damn thing or tanking? If that's the case, the Sixers/Suns/Clippers/one of the Nets or Bucks should just pack it in. What's the point, right? Trade everything for draft picks, so we can draft the next Jarrett Culver (no offense Wolves fans). Also, don't forget about cap space flexibility‚Ñ¢, that shits important. Go ask Miami how vital that is, oh wait-  These guys talk about the Bulls like we're getting DeMar and Vooch as the chosen ones to lead us to the promise land. Like our front office is that na√Øve. That's not the point of all of this. The idea is to raise the floor for Zach to flourish and re-sign, while we also try to compete until Pat Will develops into the player the front office aspires him to be a few years from now (maybe something between Siakam-Paul George level?), AS WELL AS being a destination for free agents. It's no coincidence Lonzo and DeMar chose us. The culture is changing. Players are keeping a close eye. If we're spicy next year, we should be in the running for superstars in the future (just a coincidence that Vooch's contract expires the same year as Jokic's. It's a great bet that if Jokic enters free agency, AK, the guy that brought him over to the NBA, will try his damndest to bring the Joker in      Why is it that when Miami does shit-- zero draft picks in the future, signs Jimmy Butler to a 4-year max contract (someone who freaking got outscored by Bryn Forbes in the Playoffs mind you), commit 90 million each to a 35-year old Kyle Lowry and one dimensional Duncan Robinson, as well as throwing out their MLE to a zero on offense PJ Tucker-- it's all good. Pat Riley is a genius. #HeatCulture. I don't hate the Heat or their moves, just sucks that there's a double standard      But when we do the same shit, experts hate it. Zach is only 26, Pat Will is only 19, Lonzo is only 23. We're still a young team. We just got guys to raise the floor for these guys to succeed, while also changing the infrastructure for future free agents who would want to come here"

They are literally changing reality. The truth is that he turned down $84m for MORE money because he was angry that he was included in trade rumors for Kyle Lowry . He just got less because of his ego and greed.
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Kyle Lowry is the best Raptor of all time
"Yeah but Lowry gets a significant amount of dough, and Philly didn't have it. If Philly had the money and/or wanted to give up one of their better players, Lowry could very well be in Philly competing for a championship. I'd argue he'd have a better shot at a title playing alongside Embiid than Butler and Bam. Miami, Pelicans, and Dallas all had more money to offer. But if the Money was right I trust Kyle would be in Philly.  And there's many other examples of people who want to play where they're from (LeBron, Kawhi). Powell's situation is different in that he's not good enough to actually get to have much say in the matter  But I think there'd be a lot of people who'd be happy to play at home if the situation was right. Khem Birch was overjoyed to be signing in Canada. I think that as the number of Canadians in the league continues to grow, you'll see more guys having interest in playing in TO."

"&gt; They‚Äôre going all in with Lowry and Butler.  Don't forget Bam. Imo, Bam is their best player right now. Jimmy is their most valuable player though. Kyle is the X factor and they'll go as far as Kyle takes them."
"When Kyle Lowry was considering his options, you don‚Äôt think he took this into consideration? There‚Äôs a good chance Kyle Lowry declines in play during his contract, and he doesn‚Äôt want any promises to get thrown out the window at that point.  Again I‚Äôll repeat:  &gt; Players can‚Äôt control natural decline in play. To claim that him declining is a breach of contract is fucking stupid."
"&gt;*He's not right.  The Pelicans clearly want a PG to run the offense, or they wouldn't have gone balls out to get Lowry.  We can argue about whether that's the best use of resources, but its clearly what the Pelicans want to happen, and they let the perfect fit for that walk.*  ***Not why we wanted Lowry.***  We were interested in Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry because we don't have any lockerroom leadership. We're still a very young team and every time we've brought a vet along (Adams, Jrue, JJ Redick, Bledsoe,) they've been well-received/friendly in the lockerroom but don't hold people accountable, or act like 'leaders.'  BI and Zion haven't really taken leadership over the team or point out when guys aren't giving their all or motivate their teammates + pick up the energy on the court when it's needed. And they can't close out games.  So FO was trying to get vet leaders in to teach them.  Once Dinwiddie, Lowry, and Paul said 'no,' they moved on to grabbing shooters like Reggie Jackson, Danny Green, THJ, etc. Guys who could play off of our two main guys. We didn't really get a locker room leader into the mix like we wanted.  Kyle and Chris can change *the culture* of a team.  That's why we wanted them."
Lowry trying to go under Hill‚Äôs legs is one of the funniest clips I‚Äôve seen lol. And Kyle probably could have pulled it off too had he tried it on a tall center haha
"Igoudala played, he hit a game winner on us actually. Cousins also played. Looney? Can't believe you seriously just said raptors won bc fucking Looney went down. Curry was also not injured tf? Kyle Lowry was more injured than curry. When Thompson was on the court we won majority of the quarters we played, you forget we were up in the serious when Thompson went down?  KD would've probably changed the game though. We won bc KD went down, without KD we beat that GS squad.  Also OG anunoby was injured for us, who's possibly best iso defender in the league, so absolutely we had good chances of winning it again next year."
"I think we wanted to see Kyle go home to Philly, and were prepared to root for y'all if it happened. Then the offer didn't come.   Objectively, if you trade maxey, Danny green and Mike Scott for Kyle lowry, do you make the conference finals? I think we were all rooting for it."
"I do not tolerate Lowry slander  But with that being said, Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt have cake"
100% We got the Warrior killer himself aka Kyle Lowry!üî•
I think we won the Kyle Lowry trade. üò≠
That‚Äôs why they traded Kyle Lowry
"As a Mavs fan, I think Luka is bad at enabling KP. I feel if CP3 or Kyle Lowry were on the Mavs, they could figure out how KP could be used effectively."
"Lowry wasn't our best player last year.   Our offence was so clunky with Fred and Kyle on the floor at the same time. It didn't pass the eye test, and analytics agree.   Our best players last year imo were Fred, then Pascal, Lowry, OG and Boucher. In that order."
Mo Cheeks got in the Hall of Fame. Kyle Lowry definitely could.
"Ironically, on the list of other candidates for Greatest PG... you also see a lot of bad defenders...  Curry, Nash, Westbrook, AI, Pistons Isaiah, Oscar Robertson (Cincinatti always had great O and horrific D)  The good defenders for that list are like Jason Kidd, Kyle Lowry, John Stockton, CP3. I think outside CP3 none of those guys are really GOAT candidates for the position, zero MVPs between them."
I like this one because I‚Äôm the exact opposite. I think he‚Äôs one of *the* most overrated players of the decade. I‚Äôd trade Ben for a dildo at this point but I‚Äôd be rather unhappy if the dildo came with Kyle Lowry.
"A team with Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaq, David Robinson, and John Stockton and youre calling REGGIE MILLER the leader?  And theres a LOT of 5 time allstars that get .00001% of the love reggie gets. Al Horford has 5 allstars too. Kyle Lowry has 6. Amare Stoudemire has 6. Aint nobody give them the love reggie gets.  Also, I do think he should be in the HoF (mostly for longevity and some of the iconic playoff moments) but I also DO NOT think he was anywhere as good as people think he was."
"IIRC from 2010-2020 the WAR leaders for Eastern Conference are Lebron James, big gap, Kyle Lowry, big gap, and then everyone else."
Kyle Lowry and Fred Van Vleet are ass.
"I certainly think you are more likely to finish 3-5, but we don't know how the roster changes are going to play out.   ____  **Bulls**: Added DeRozan, Lonzo, Caruso, and Bradley  * Biggest wild card, especially when you remember Vuc only played 26 games in Chicago last season. You can't say you're better than this team because we've never seen this team.  **Knicks** Added Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier   * Last year you beat them 3-1, but it's undeniable that Kemba and Evan are a massive upgrade to their stagnant offense. I think you probably are still better, but I'm not going to say 100%.  **Heat**: Added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, and Markieff Morris   * The Heat were another team last year that was plagued with injuries and covid protocol. Add onto that some massive wins in free agency and I don't see how anyone could say you are definitely better.  **Celtics**: Added Dennis, Horford, and JRich, Lost Kemba and Fournier  * The biggest reason I included the Celtics is because last year they had very few games where they all played together. Brown was injured late in the season while Smart also missed 25 games due to injury. Kemba was never particularly effective with their units, so I think that the additions they made made them better than they were last year. This is another fringe case, but I don't think you can say you are definitely the better team."
"My boy got that Kyle Lowry booty, call him Strus Caboose"
Kyle Lowry is more important to winning basketball games than most of your favorite allstars
"Maybe the greatest player to wear a Raptors jersey, but there is only one GROAT and his name is Kyle Lowry."
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
I don‚Äôt think making the Hall of Fame exclusive is a bad thing though. For example Kyle Lowry has an 84% chance according to basketball reference and he‚Äôll probably make it after that title. But personally I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever been a top 10 guy either and wouldn‚Äôt put him in.
"He's got ""it"" like a Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, etc. Guys who are better than thier stats even show due to thier ability to affect winning and elevate their teams"
Gonna overreact and say this kid is a lock for a Kyle Lowry career.

"Why would the Knicks even be considered? I‚Äôm not a fan of either team but him on the Knicks is the same ceiling as Portland (second round). Randle wasn‚Äôt even better than D.Rose in the playoffs I doubt they‚Äôd win anything. As an objective basketball fan I think the inside/out punch of Dame and Embiid could potentially knock off the top dogs in the East. Embiid dominates any big or interior defense of eastern conference foes with Dame, Curry, Harris, and whoever spacing the floor. The Sixers would be legit finals threats with Dame where the Knicks would still be Dame carrying the franchise without enough fire power to beat the Bucks, Nets, or even Miami with Kyle Lowry joining."
"They would be working with Dame to send to him to a team he wants to play for, not ""helping another team win a championship"" lol. This happens all the time, Kyle Lowry just worked with his FO to go to Miami. CP3 worked with the Thunder FO to make a trade to Phoenix. Harden did it this past season.  They'd be working together to get Dame to a place he wants, you're kidding yourself if you think the FO is sending him to Minnesota"
Kyle Lowry
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Toughness, hustle, and leadership. That's why my favorite player is Kyle Lowry."
"&gt; edit: to put that in context, Paul Pierce and Kyrie Irving have each made 2nd team only once. Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, and Klay Thompson have never done it.  that should tell you more about how weird selections are than about how good he must have been"

"Outside of the picks we gave up mozgov, Anthony Randolph, Gallo, Chandler, and Felton.   We got back Carter, Billups, Jr, Melo and someone else I can‚Äôt remember  We got back tradable pieces as well.   The issue was not trading what we still had for improvements.   Remember the Kyle Lowry trade. Iman and a first for Lowry? Yea instead of doing that they went for Lou Almonson and Lance Thomas  Remember how we gave up a first for Bargnani   Yea we could have used that first for someone better.   It‚Äôs not about wasting the assets because we still had assets to trade. It was about making the right trades and the Knicks didn‚Äôt do it"
Actually yea. He was about to be and should have been moved for Kyle Lowry but instead the Knicks backed out of the trade and instead sent him to Cleveland for peanuts

"Melo getting traded to the Knicks did not cripple our chances of competing. I always hate when people say this. It was Phil Jackson, Steve Mills, and James Dolan giving him guys like Shane Larkin, Samuel Dalembert, an aging Ron Artest, Jose Calderon, and Alexy Shved.   Then wasting our assets on  Andrea Bargnani, giving away Iman Shumpert for Lance Thomas and Lou Almondson, and then backing away from the trade that was pretty much a done deal for Kyle Lowry.   They literally put garbage around Melo.   On top of that, Amare was never healthy, and the one season he was he punched a fire extinguisher and hurt himself and was out.   Yea we could have used the assets in the Melo trade to upgrade the team but we still had other picks and players to use as well and they didn‚Äôt get anyone good with them"
Is Kyle Lowry a lock?
Kyle Lowry
Is Kyle Lowry a Hall of Famer ?
"You can see some clowns waving at him for sure and it really is sickening. There a  TON of people however just starting, some even pointing down the court at him (on the side Ibaka was scoring on).  20k people man, it's not that loud in there because the minority clowns were louder than the majority. I will also say the cheering got notably louder AFTER he was helped up off the floor which we both know is standard.   The commentators say their thing and then Lowry (after speaking to KD and hearing its the same injury) quiets everyone down. Lets say the fans were malicious, why would they cheer for KD if Kyle told them to stfu. They would just be quiet but everyone knew how it definitely looked (because there was overlap between cheers) so that was their way of doing it.   I know this because i went through the exact same set of emotions in the same few seconds."

Do it. It's also not clear to me the taxes they pay when they play a road game. Like if the Heat plays the Lakers in Staples does that mean Kyle Lowry will have to pay California state tax for his game earnings?
"I liked how, unlike Kyle Lowry, Jalen Suggs stopped this play with actual defense instead of yanking the offensive player‚Äôs arm down as hard as he could when the player was going up for the finish at the rim.   Just one subtle difference from Kyle Lowry that I enjoyed seeing."
"‚ÄúLead his team past the first round‚Äù LOL bro he was ok against the Nets, Kyle Lowry was the best player for the raps for the entire playoffs."
I mean this sub only gets weird like that when it‚Äôs for the men lol. The only ass we talk about here is Kyle Lowry. And the only tits spoken of here are Hardens (alleged) ones.
"I'm not that high on Barnes. I think that Toronto just made the mistake that Orlando's been making for years becoming enamored with the long athletic tweener forward (fluctuating between the 3 and the 4) types because in theory they do so much. In practice who fits that description and is an all star level guy? Kawhi and Tatum, there's a tier difference between those 2 and then Pascal Siakam, and then theres another drop off in that archetype of player down to Tobias Harris, maybe a time ago Carmelo Anthony and Paul Millsap? I leave LeBron and KD off here (and I really dont feel comfortable with Tatum being in this category either) because they were uber skilled players before they were switchable defensive pieces. They're just so talented and uniquely built that you put them on the floor and build a lineup around them and if they end up the 4 instead of the 3 then youre not mad about it because they're the best player on the floor 90% of the time anyways.  Whereas I feel like over the last 20 years the high energy and high IQ  point guard has been a consistent floor raising guy that you always see on playoff teams. Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Jrue had some bad teams in New Orleans but him too. Go back a decade or more and throw guys like Tony Parker and prime Kidd on there too.  Idk i felt this since draft night I feel like Toronto outsmarted themselves with Barnes. He may end up being a good player and long switchable wings definitely don't grow on trees. I also may end up entirely wrong but I feel like we've talked ourselves into the archetype of Barnes in the mid/high lottery before and it ended up being a stinker pick."
"Goran, I watched Kyle Lowry. I watched him bring the Raptors to a championship. Kyle Lowry was a great Raptor. Goran, you're no Kyle Lowry."
In a different timeline the r/Torontoraptors sub would be filled with ‚Äúwe replaced Kyle Lowry with Kyle Lowry‚Äù and Spider-Man pointing memes
Lmfao.   The Hawks played the Heat in an important late season game last year missing 4 out of 5 starters (John Collins was the only starter that played) and beat them by double digits.   The Hawks were the 3rd most injured team in the league and that‚Äôs the only reason why the two teams had similar records.  There was a wide gap between a healthy hawks team and a healthy heat te last year and it‚Äôs larger than a Kyle Lowry and a PJ Tucker could fill.    On top of that the Hawks are even deeper this year than they were last year and most of their roster should improve because of how young they are.
Literally a Kyle Lowry regen
"if Kyle Lowry blocks your shot I think you need to do 15 push-ups, pretty sure that‚Äôs in the NBA rule book."

"He worked on them but not to the same degree as the other skills that he felt were important to him (mid-range game &amp; handles). He idolized Kobe and wanted to perfect all of his mid-range moves. I don't fault him for that, he's still a tremendous player, but i'm just saying that it's not like Derozan was a guy that did whatever it took for the team to win. He didn't dive on the court for loose balls, take charges or any of those things that we loved Lowry for. IMO Kyle was the unselfish one out of the two. Derozan was still a great guy, but he wanted to play the game his way."
Yall still doing crossovers? Kyle Lowry has evolved to crossunders
Looking thick waist-down ngl. Kyle Lowry got some competition
Kyle Lowry sucks and can only score at the line
"I don't necessarily disagree but for me it's more like a greatest vs best thing , kawhi is possibly the best raptors but DeMar and Lowry are the greatest specially when the raptors would not even be in a situation where they were close to contention before the kawhi trade without DeMar and Kyle. It's like lebron is the best Miami heat ever but Wade is the greatest."

‚ÄúRudy Gay your gay‚Äù - Kyle Lowry 2009
What if Kyle Lowry is my team‚Äôs star? üòé
"I understand what arguable means. My point is that Dragic has no argument for being better than Jimmy. He got a large contract because Pat Riley spends money like it‚Äôs going out of style. Just look at the contracts he gave to Hassan Whiteside and Tyler Johnson instead of Wade, or paying a washed Iguodala $15 million a year.   Being a team leader or the most important guy in the team doesn‚Äôt always mean that the guy is the best player on his team, or even that he has an argument for it. Case in point, Kyle Lowry was unquestionably the leader of the 2019 Raptors, and he was probably our most important player (at least on the offensive end) as well. But despite that, he had literally zero argument for being the best player on the team, because Kawhi clearly was that guy. It‚Äôs the same thing with Dragic and Jimmy."
Yeah but Kyle Lowry wasnt worth thybulle and maxey?
Lmao only lakers fans think he‚Äôs like a future all star or something because pelinka chose talen Horton heard a who over Kyle Lowry and they want to cope.   Most people consider him a solid bench player and no more. He‚Äôs properly rated.
So they could get Kyle Lowry
"Just everything about this is so dishonest and full of false equivalences. 22/9 sounds fine if you're Kyle Lowry and if it's efficient, but it was on bad efficiency with bad defense and a lot of turnovers. You're relating it to Steph, but the difference there is that Steph played meh against the Rockets until Durant went down. Then he stepped up when his team was depleted and hard carried them to victory against Harden and CP3 despite missing our other best player. He played incredibly when it mattered most and when we faced elimination. It's the opposite of Dame, who played badly under the pressure of elimination and was saved by CJ. Then Curry went and immediately dominated Dame. You reference his bad game in the 2018 finals, which literally did not matter as we were up 2-0 in a lopsided series, rather than facing elimination. Another bad analogy. Funny enough you mention Meyers Leonard, which normally would be a good point, except he played exceptionally well against us. Most of your role players honestly did. Dame and CJ did not, and Nurk was out. That's why you lost.   &gt;And you calling 2017 ‚Äújust fine‚Äù tells me all I need to know.  You've lost me here. That was undeniably his best series of the ones listed. I attended Game 1 in person, and Dame and CJ lit us the fuck up. I give him props for that series honestly. There was just no beating the 2017 Warriors. By ""just fine"", I'm just saying it wasn't really a bad series for him. Not amazing, as he still shot 28% from three and was poor defensively, plus he only averaged 3 assists which is less than he's definitely capable of. But a good series nonetheless that I don't fault him for, especially missing Nurk for almost the entire series.  I really don't see how I'm being in any way unfair to Dame. In eight playoff trips, he's had six first round exits, including three four game sweeps. He's had some great moments and great series, but he's had about as many bad ones. It's not like he shits the bed every single playoffs or anything, but he's inconsistent. He's gonna be remembered for moments like the shot against the Rockets and the shot against OKC, but he's 100% had more than his fair share of bad performances as well."
"These headlines still make me lol.

"Yeah, I‚Äôve always looked at the hall of fame as something different from what many think it is. It‚Äôs not the hall of greatness, famous doesn‚Äôt mean the best player but they have to be important in some way.

The hall should act more like a Museum where we can remember players and the importance they have to basketball."

"Kyle Lowry was charged with Misdemeanor Battery on female referee in 2012 but most of you nephews were in kindergarten. I guess you can say he was bad cop turned good cop.   However, it might just be a isolated incident, that doesn't necessarily make him a bad dude."
"what in the fuck yes he did  his biggest competition the past few years in the east was a teenage jayson tatum, demar derozan, kyle lowry, victor oladipo, and a young paul george  you gotta be smoking nuts to think he wasn't in the absolute weakest conference all those years  plus on top of that the dude would get to the finals and LOSE to the western team more times than not"
"I think they are about even, but Kyle Lowry theoretically does fix a lot of problems for Miami. They get a very good guard defender giving them a great switchable defensive guard/wing/big combo in Lowry, Butler, Bam. He can be an off-ball shooter with Butler playmaking or be the lead playmaker and scorer for the team.   Miami had the same winning percentage as Milwaukee last year when Jimmy Butler played. They also added PJ Tucker and if Tyler Herro looks a bit more like his rookie year self, this team is very well constructed."
"OK. I'm gonna need a professional journalist to ask Lowry about this because I just can't make sense of it and I've been thinking about it far too long!   The only idea I can think of is that Kyle was sleep deprived and under fed, arrived to the game with a hangover that felt like the rough side of bit of wood, and when he felt George's right thigh he thought he was getting crowded by George's arms and went to hook his arm with his right. But instead Kyle hooked George's leg, chicken winged that shit and charge forward.  Let me know your thoughts.  Kind regards,  AmbiguousPreposition"

"This is over the top scapegoating.   Old head announcers love to rant about how ""players don't know how to make entry passes anymore,"" but the truth of the matter is that modern defenses have gotten sophisticated enough (and the removal of illegal defense rules) that you can't just clear out and easily dump it into the post anymore.   And aside from the difficulties/inefficiencies associated with trying to run clasical post-ups in the modern game... if you don't like the types of looks you're getting, that's gotta be at least 80% on you for not establishing better position. If he had Kyle Lowry genes, this might be a different story."
Yeah I remember Kyle Lowry getting clowned year after year for choking in the playoffs big time and he eventually figured it out... I hope that Simmons finally turns the corner wherever he goes.
"2019 was dope.   Bucks were plowing through the East. Raptors-6ers is one of the best series in recent years. Raps-Bucks was also insane. Death of the Celtics is always a great thing too.   Warriors/Clipps was fun, Warriors/Rockets was also great, Dame sent the Thunder home with an iconic shot and wave, tough 7-game series to move on to the WCF too. WCF sweep was hilarious because the Blazers had a double digit lead in every game.   Then the Finals was still somewhat competitive even without KD. Got some huge games, career high from Steph in game 3, Siakam crazy Finals debut in game 1, Klay on absolute fire, Kyle Lowry dispelling his playoff demons in game 6."
"7 feet 190 lbs, good gravy. I'm 5'11"" and when I was lifting weights a lot more and also got a little chubby, I was flirting with 190.  nba.com has Fred VanVleet at 197 pounds, Kyle Lowry at 196, Chris Paul at 175.  Strap this boy into the force feeding apparatus."
I believe the correct answer is:  ‚Äúkyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time.‚Äù
toronto 100% hung lowry out to dry until the championship.  i took a bus trip with a bunch of randoms in march 2019 (the championship season) to go see a raptors game in detroit and the entire bus was unfairly slandering the man on the whole trip down. me and my friend were some of the only people defending him on a full bus.  then he dropped 35 points in that game and everybody was talking about how great kyle is on the bus ride back home to toronto. i damn near got whiplash watching those people flip so hard and fast.
"Agreed, but Van Vleet has basically been groomed to be the team's leader with Kyle Lowry off to Miami. Simmons couldn't do that in his absence, and I don't see Siakam being able to be a locker room leader. Simmons combined with the rest of the Raptors would be a defensive juggernaut, but Simmons is too mentally soft and too poor on the work at his front for it to work."
"One, firing an established coach like Doc after one season (when the second best player shit the bed) with your franchise is a bad look and could stir not just head coaches but assistants alike from working with your team.  Two, Kyle Lowry is a 35 year old PG who was on an expiring. It‚Äôs not insane to not trade for him. Three, we still have no confirmation what the final Sixers package even was for Harden, just a bunch of unreliable, contradicting reports. Four, trying to get max value for a 25 year old Dpoy level player isn‚Äôt crazy either lol. This is from a Bulls fan who could care less about what happens with this situation but shitting on Morey for this situation makes little sense. The only thing I would agree with is he waited to long to trade Ben now return might not be as good but the most realistic packages are still available"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"Kyle Lowry is in his 30s on an expiring contract. Also literally every other team didn‚Äôt want to trade for him either, y‚Äôall are just fucking obsessed with the Sixers lmfao"
"Thank you, and I completely understand where you're coming from! To split up large teams, I looked for local arenas that would somewhat evenly distribute the players. For all players in the United States &amp; Canada, I used the haversine formula to determine what their closest team would be. Lowry's location I actually got from his Player's Tribune article ([https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kyle-lowry-raptors-nba-all-star](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kyle-lowry-raptors-nba-all-star)).  &gt;My mom worked two jobs and made sure she provided everything I needed. It‚Äôs just the way it was. **I grew up at 20th and Lehigh in Philadelphia**. In my neighborhood, I was hardly the only one who was fatherless or motherless growing up.  For Durant, it's a single kilometre difference (9 km to the Entertainment and Sports Arena vs 10 km to the Capital One Center). Admiral's difference is even closer (42.63 km to Washington, 43.26 km to Capital City).  I didn't think the bodies of water were ""major enough"" to not use haversine for Kemba and AI, but upon further inspection Kemba goes over the East River to land in Queens, while AI goes over the Potomac &amp; Rappahannock Rivers that open up into Chesapeake Bay"
Kyle Lowry was a top 10 player in his best season and arguably top 6 point guard of the 2010s
"This is great work. Just a bit confused. Like even as someone from Philly, we don't really see a difference between Wynnewood and the rest of Philly (it's just a small neighborhood). Kyle Lowry grew up in North Philly which is not near Wynnewood, but he did go to O'Hara which is kind of near that area. So technically Lowry would be on the regular Philly team no?   Also why is David Robinson from Manassas (1 hour from Washington DC) on the Wizards, but KD who grew up literally 5 mins outside the DC city lines on the Capitol City Go-Go team? And AI is also on the Go-Go but he's from VA Beach?  Also why is Kemba who grew up in the Bronx on the Queens team. He'd definitley be more on the Knicks no?  That being said. That Berkley Team and Wynnewod are stacked!"
I kinda like that Kyle Lowry guy
"The main issue I saw with the Warriors that I would like to see some way of addressed (either by progress from Poole or Lee stepping up for example) is they only have 1 late shot clock guy: steph. There's reasons why Dame and CJ don't work, but theyre always a passably efficient offense in the playoffs because they have 2 late shot clock guys. The Bucks have Middleton and then Jrue and Giannis have the ability to switch off as the second late shot clock dump off, the Nets have their 3, the Lakers ideally have 2 but I think they think they have 3, the Jazz have Conley and Mitchell, the Heat now have Jimmy and Kyle Lowry. Now some of these squads have other flaws that pull them back but the presence of 2 volume ball handlers and decisive late shot clock guys gives your offense a certain floor because you have a certain quality of shot you find every time down, even against correct defenses.  In a playoff series, because the game will inevitably slow down, at some point you're going to be in the half court more than Golden State wants to be, and we've seen Steph get absolutely murdered off ball because by any means Steph can't be allowed space late in the shot clock. In '16 you saw some of this become a problem, they still pulled out wins with a hobbled Steph but even when Draymond was a more capable scorer it became difficult to generate consistent looks in the half court because everything *had to be on time* for Golden State, and against a certain level of defense you're just going to run late some times. That's why KD was so lethal in Golden State was because with 7-9 seconds on the shot clock you could just get him the ball wherever, as far as 32 feet back if you had to, and he could get in his bag and get you a bucket."
Kyle Lowry
"kyle lowry was pissed they traded demar, being friends doesnt equate to winning basketball games"
"&gt;Just like De'Aaron Fox, Mike Connelly, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, &amp; Steve Nash you can tell that after a bad first year they are a bust.  ""but look at these 6 examples that worked out after a bad first year after 100's that didn't work out after a bad first year""  think man THINK"
"Just like De'Aaron Fox, Mike Connelly, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, &amp; Steve Nash you can tell that after a bad first year they are a bust.    You need a player like Brandon Jennings, Michael Carter Williams, or Tyreke Evans; after good rookie years those guys were destined to be stars."
Kyle Lowry is a good player butt was never good enough to get past Lebron
Saw ‚ÄúKyle Lowry‚Äù and ‚ÄúButt‚Äù in the same post. Enough to get my vote anyday
And Kyle Lowry
"Both are extremely flawed. Unfortunately, if you look at players selections over the years, they're just as bad if not worse. Players will consistently over rate individually dazzling talents like Kyrie - who sucks compared to his reputation, and consistently underrate players who help teams win but don't bring individual pizzaz.      I don't think there is a player in the NBA that would pick prime Kyle Lowry over prime Kyrie. But they should. Lowry is unquestionably the better player."
Kyle Lowry easily. He had way more longevity was the 2nd best player on a title team.
Don't forget Kyle Lowry!
&gt; Kyle Lowry has never been the best PG in the league.  ok and neither has rondo?
"That's because they faced joke opponents, including the mighty 50 win Celtics and Raptors who didn't have Isaiah and Kyle Lowry. The east was such a joke.  That whole year was a joke in terms of competition. The worst the NBA has ever been."
Kyle Lowry is better all time  Better suited for the HOF? Lowry  Higher peak? Rondo  '12 Rondo was carrying the Celtics for big stretches during the playoffs. One game away from the NBA Finals.
"No. All of the points you made are offset to me by the fact that they lost the heart of their team and their best player in Kyle Lowry, and the East has gotten better, and it's not like they upgraded significantly at center. They're retooling and that's okay"
"i‚Äôm from canada and i hate the raptors purely because TSN is always pushing them so hard because they‚Äôre owned by the same group as the raptors, maple leafs, etc. i wish i could like them but years of ‚Äúkyle lowry is averaging 19/7/4‚Ä¶ mvp?!‚Äù has driven me away"
that one game against us this last year where we were desperately trying to move up in the standings and kyle lowry literally turned into steph was the day i knew our season was fucked
Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up shooter
"2018 Cavaliers vs Toronto. Not CJ Miles vs Kevin Love because I actually understood what Casey was trying to do there, but the actual starting lineups. The Cavs played small with Hill/Korver/Smith/LeBron/Love while we played big with Lowry/DeRozan/OG/Ibaka/JV. OG had to guard LeBron for obvious reasons and Lowry had to guard Hill. This left the trio of DeRozan/JV/Ibaka to guard Kyle Korver, JR Smith and Kevin Love. JV can‚Äôt defend in space, asking Ibaka to run through screens to guard Smith is silly to me and DeRozan being a weak off ball defender and screen navigator having to guard Korver was lunacy. There was a reason all three of those guys shot bonkers from 3. I actually thought the idea of CJ Miles on Love made some sense because in theory, either you have a wing that can fight over screens better and actually contest Loves threes, or you have him try to post him up where you can then send help at the rim and force Love to become a playmaker out of the post. The issue was that the help rarely came and Miles was just left on an island"
True and I really like Kyle Lowry.
Lol !!! How bout Big booty Kyle Lowry
"Who were probably the biggest unrestricted free agents this summer? You had guys like Kawhi, Conley, and Chris Paul who just re-signed with their teams (and that could happen with LaVine, of course). But what about guys like Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan? They were unrestricted but ended up getting signed and traded elsewhere. So the same could happen with big unrestricted free agents next summer as well, right?  So of course, the big question is ""why would the Bulls sign and trade LaVine next summer?"" Well first he'd have to make them believe he's going to leave no matter what. He could do that by threatening to go to Orlando, San Antonio or Detroit. That's probably how Kyle Lowry got Toronto to send him to Miami: by making them think if they didn't then he'd go sign with New Orleans and they'd get nothing in return. At least now they have Precious and Dragic, right?  So if LaVine wanted to go to say, the Lakers (this is Klutch, after all), all he'd have to do is convince the Bulls that they're going to lose him either way, and then they'll feel like they'd be better off getting something for him rather than nothing. So then all the Lakers would have to do to offer him a 4 year max at $154 million in a sign and trade is send back matching salary for that first year at $35.7 million. If only the Lakers had a big expiring contract they could send... Oh yeah, Westbrook will only have one year left on his contract next summer, they could send him! They also could send Chicago native Talen Horton-Tucker or their first round pick in 2027, 2028 or 2029 if needed.   So there you go. If you're a conspiracy theorist and you're wondering why LaVine might sign with Klutch, well it could be for the same reason Anthony Davis did. Or maybe he plans to just re-sign with the Bulls and wants Rich Paul to represent him. We'll have to wait and see."
"Russ, Dame, Kd, and Kyle Lowry"
Fred Vanvleet/Kyle Lowry/Chris Paul
"Walton's biggest argument over Dikembe is that in his peak, he was just a much better player. Walton did average 18/13/5 like you said, but his impact spoke much higher than his stats, the Blazers were an all-time great team with him and a below .500 squad without him.  Dikembe played a very long time, but he was always just a pretty decent center, at no point in his entire career he was a Top 3 center in the league, let alone achieve the heights that a guy like Walton did.  I get that longevity matters, but to me it has become the most overrated aspect of basketball. I rather have 10 years of an MVP candidate (Doncic, for example) than 20 years of a fringe All-NBA guy (Kyle Lowry)."
Kyle Lowry
- Jalen Suggs  - Pat Bev  - Kyle Lowry
"Its clear that Morey values Simmons more than 3 high level starters, look at the trade proposals that have been leaked  &gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in the 2021 NBA Draft, and two future first-round picks.  &gt;Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick.  Both of these should indicate the trade value Morey's ranks Simmons.   &gt;The Knicks could have traded Randle, RJ, Mitch and 4 FRPs to the Rockets  If the Knicks were offered that then they would be dumb to pass that up. Harden is perennial MVP candidate and future HOFer in his prime even with the possibility that he would get upset any team would trade for Harden because he changes your team to a contender with just him on the roster.   Harden is not comparable because Simmons is clearly not the level of player he is, and his trade (and outcome of trade) should not be seen as a comparable situation given how the context of the two teams are so different."
T.J. McConnell  Kyle Lowry  Chris Paul
People said that about Kyle Lowry then look what happened.   People said that about Khris Middleton then look what happened.
Kyle Lowry?

"In 2006 first pick was Andrea Bargnani.  LMA, Rudy Gay, JJ Reddick, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker and Paul Thrillsap were 2, 8, 11, 21, 24, 35 and 47, respectively."
"Jalen Brunson, Fred Van Vleet, Kyle Lowry"
I saw someone post that Kyle Lowry could guard Shaq because he would just take charges. As if Shaq was just some big guy who had no skill or finesse.

"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we‚Äôre trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs like a tile team but that team would ‚Äúmaximize‚Äù ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
My mom and my aunt call Kyle Lowry his little brother.

"I don‚Äôt think signing Kyle Lowry to 3 years is just an out and out win now move if you‚Äôre a team like the Pelicans. I think trading our most coveted assets for a third star is the win now move in our situation. As stated above, we are a very young team. BI is turning 24 in a week for example"
"Listen to this guy, hes a personal friend of Kyle Lowry"
Ask them their opinion on Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry is not that good so they thought they could get him.
"They got an all star caliber point guard, a franchise GOAT, one of the best leaders of all time in Kyle Lowry  Don't for a second doubt him"
"A certain GM has clowned the New Orleans Pelicans for missing out on Kyle Lowry. For privacy purposes, lets call him Pat R. No, that's too obvious... we'll call him P. Riley."
"If in this offseason, we‚Äôd likely end up losing KP for nothing and still not even get a player like Kyle Lowry or Lonzo Ball. There‚Äôs not too many quality choices out on the market that met the needs of Dallas."
I will say that signing Kyle Lowry at his age doesn't make a ton of sense and is kind of the definition of win now and they were going for it.
Any trade involving Kyle Lowry as the best player is not ‚Äúbig time‚Äù
"Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams were clear attempts at trying to win now. Going after Kyle Lowry was another win now move. Griffin clearly wants this team in the playoffs, which is fine, but these types of moves are not going to get the team closer to a championship ceiling. He‚Äôs playing checkers, not chess."
Kyle Lowry half court shot vs Miami to send it to OT. Had to pause and get my dad into the living room to show him how awesome it was
"Westbrook, Simmons, Lowry. People are overrating Kyle Lowry in this thread. He went 15-31 as a starter this past season with a team that was expected to make the playoffs."
Yeah but Kyle Lowry
"&gt; The Bagels traded Bruce Brown, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, a 2023 1st round pick, and a 2025 1st round pick to the Cyclones for Bam Adebayo, Dewayne Dedmon, and Kyle Lowry.  Lol, thanks Brooklyn."

I was gonna say he's looking Kyle Lowry ish
A little biased but Kyle Lowry
"Kyle Lowry -- on the court, he's extremely intense and all business.  Off the court, he seems like a pretty fun-loving and caring dude."

Dejounte Murray  EDIT: I swear I wrote out 11-22 numbers but reddit doesn't like starting lists at 11?
"8 man playoff rotation:   - Kawhi Leonard - Kyle Lowry - Pascal Siakam - Fred VanVleet - Norman Powell - Marc Gasol - Serge Ibaka - Danny Green  and OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy the eve of the playoffs and missed the entire postseason  The deepest team I've ever watched as a Raps fan. Zero defensive weak points and balanced offense across the entire roster. Shooting and scoring from all 3 levels, great playmakers and finishers, and subbing in Nick Nurse for Casey put them over the top."
"5 years out is way too early to evaluate draft players and where they lie with respect to their class.   For instance, Kyle Lowry in 2011 would probably have been regarded as a borderline 10th best player from the 2006 draft. Now in 2021, I'd probably say the second best player of his class behind Aldridge."
Kyle Lowry cries too much.
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
Yes. If Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan can knock on the door of an NBA finals then a deep team around Tatum and Brown should be able to compete for a title. The problem for Boston is that it is very very hard to accumulate 10 solid rotation caliber players.
Kyle Lowry and Klay Thompson?
For me it has to be Kyle Lowry. For the longest time I thought he was Canadian because he played for Raptors. Also I had no clue he spent his first 7 years in the NBA playing for Grizzlies and Rockets.
It‚Äôs Kyle Lowry if he scored 2 less PPG.
That team was pretty loaded and Kyle Lowry is nothing to scoff at.
"I think your definition of ""top players"" and superstars is very different than mine. Kyle Lowry is not a top PG. He may be a top 10 PG but can't sniff the top 5. You can have Billups... I'm taking Tony Parker all day long and twice on Sunday. Billups was a nice player and had a few good years, but he was never an NBA great. Tony Parker was better at almost every aspect of being a true PG. Remember  CB's shortcomings-- concerns were he wasnt as skilled as most NBA PGs but he wasn't tall or athletic enough to be a two guard. He was a tweener. He was never the hands down best player on his team--Detroit didn't have a best player. He won in Detroit and went on the underachieve as a team alongside Carmelo in Denver."
You pointed out Steve Nash who was also on Dallas before he became an MVP at a later time.  Same with Kyle Lowry who became a top PG when given the chance.  Like those two guys it just took him longer to become that elite player. Why would it matter if he was on multiple teams before it happened. It did happen and he deserves credit for that performance. He was absolutely that level of player on Detroit. And it's why he will make the HOF eventually.  Also Billups was easily better than Tony Parker. Seriously what did Parker have on Billups? A better midrange game? Billups was an excellent three point shooter.
Where is KAT ? Kyle Lowry? Dort ?
Booty because I have a Kyle Lowry ass
He‚Äôs one of those Kyle Lowry players where you love him when he‚Äôs on your team and despise him when you‚Äôre playing against him
"Since the last Raptors game in Toronto, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Norm Powell and Kyle Lowry have all departed from the team.  It‚Äôs a shame Kyle didn‚Äôt get a proper goodbye in front of the Toronto home crowd this season. That ‚Äúfalse alarm‚Äù goodbye in Tampa the night before the trade deadline was bizarre in hindsight."
Raptors went very hard after an EOL Steve Nash. Kinda glad we didn't get him because that got us Kyle Lowry instead.
"Sixers almost trading for Kyle Lowry and James Harden, but of course we foolishly decided not to go through with either of them"
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, supported by Evan Turner, Steven Adams, and Robin Lopez"
I feel like it's similar to Kyle Lowry and Chauncey billups once surrounded by talent we got to see potential realised.
"This is an excellent question.   Many Canadian basketball players were already accustomed to playing in the United States before reaching the professional level, and the development of Canadian basketball programmes left players with no choice but to cross the border to pursue their dreams and aspirations.  I believe that someone like Vince, who may or may not even have visited Canada, would have struggled to represent the expansion Raptors, and he may not have been the right candidate for the job because the NBA is still an occupation.  Kyle Lowry and Masai are the right people for that gig."
"The correct answer here is someone no one would‚Äôve taken #1, but the best player in the draft was ironically Kyle Lowry to the Raptors. It just would‚Äôve taken a couple of years."
All hail Kyle Lowry and his thicc beautiful ass!
"I can't even tell if you're joking anymore. Nobody who answered that question in 2013 would randomly select 0 time all star, 0 achievements, role player Kyle Lowry as a guy who would be successful in the 90s. No one would pick a high school Jahlil Okafor in 2013 who at that point hasn't even proven he's successful in college, let alone the modern NBA, to be successful in the 90s NBA. It's ok to admit you are wrong. We're all wrong sometimes."
"My theory is that the NBA will tend to reward guys who weren‚Äôt exactly legendary players but had some type of impact in a certain era. For example, guys like Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Paul George, etc. aren‚Äôt exactly HOF worthy players (Hall of Very Good) but they were a big part of the 2010‚Äôs NBA era and they might get recognized for that. Whereas in the NFL, it‚Äôs more prestigious."
Mark Jackson shot a lot of threes and was basically a prototype of Kyle Lowry  Chris Webber would've just played point guard.
"You realize that since MJ said this in 2013, at a time when Kyle Lowry was not even an All  Star and Jahlil Okafor wasn't even in the league. I'm not saying MJ is right. I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to use these players as examples."
Okafor is just an example my guy. And Kyle Lowry made 6 straight all star games. I don't give a shit if it was in 2013 or not. There were plenty of players who would have been fantastic in the 90s and it's stupid to say there were not. It's not like the league has suddenly improved with 90s level play. It's done the opposite. As if it's not obvious Demarcus Cousins would have been dominant in the 90s. Or KD would have been anything but spectacular. Or like Curry woudln't have been an incredible shooter in the 90s when players so much his lesser were awesome.     Some of the guards like Harden would have had issues and been totally different players but yea like Dwight Howard. Z-Bo and Big Al Jefferson wouldn't have flat out been better in a league built around their specific skill sets. MJ can GTFO with that foolishness. It's just a stupid ignorant statement made specifically to get attention.
"I was talking about the fans. The Heat were likely willing to give Herro up in the Harden trade, although there are a lot of reports that Herro was what held up the Kyle Lowry trade at the deadline back in March."
"Right, because everyone knew Jahlil Okafor in 2013. Or 0 time all star Kyle Lowry in 2013.   And it's not like he said Tim Duncan already or anything."
Masai was roasted for not trading Lowry despite Kyle having final say.
That's pretty effing dumb. There's all kinds of players who would do great in MJ's era but they're not in MJ's era. Jahlil Okafor would have been an all star in the 90s. And as if Wade wouldn't have been trash. Tim Duncan? lol. Like KG would have been trash. I hate Paul Pierce but he'd have been great in the 90s. Kyle Lowry would have been an awesome guard in the 90s. It would have suited him. SMH.
"Kyle Lowry, see Mike Conley  And Monta have it all"
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"Put some respect on Kyle Lowry. He's a winner, and you're either stubborn or stupid to not see that the Heat are drastically better."
"I think you're being a little too hard on your team.  Gotta put it into perspective; you've been a team for a little over 30 years.  Here's other teams in the same boat:   * Dallas Mavericks - 1980  * Miami Heat - 1988  * New Orleans Pelicans (former Hornets) - 1988  * Minnesota Timberwolves - 1989  * Orlando Magic - 1989  * Memphis Grizzlies - 1995  * Toronto Raptors - 1995  * Charlotte Hornets (current) - 2004    You've been to the Finals twice already.  Went to the ECF two more times.  You've been in the playoffs for half of the franchise's existence   You're easily better than the Grizzlies, Hornets and Timberwolves.  I feel like you have to put it into perspective that you're still one of the youngest franchises in the league.  Look at Minnesota.  They got gifted KG, lost him, and they've never recovered.  Literally went through one of the worst playoff droughts in NBA history.  You guys got gifted Shaq, lost him, and still managed to get more superstars and go to the Finals again in the next 15 years.  Other expansion teams would dream of being that successful.  I think with perspective you'd see you're not as bad of a franchise as you're making it sound like.  You've *had* generational talents, way more than a bunch of these other franchises could claim.  Look at your franchise's best players and compare that to teams whose best players are Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry, and Kemba Walker.  Just haven't gotten one to stick yet."
"I really have to disagree - and I guess it's more to do with the term ""champion level PG"" than your comment in particular. The starting PGs since 2010 of NBA Champions are:  * Jrue Holiday * Alex Caruso * Kyle Lowry * Steph Curry (x2) * Kyrie Irving * Tony Parker * Mario Chalmers (x2) * Derek Fisher * Jason Kidd   This list goes to show ""champion level PGs"" vary wildly. Also shows that if Ben Simmons had a jumpshot and replaced the PGs in the list, he would've been an NBA Champion more often than not."
"That team had Kyle Lowry and a much better Siakim. That was also 2 seasons ago, not last year. OG is a good defender and an average offensive player. The Raptors aren‚Äôt better than the nets, bucks, 76ers, heat, hawks, Celtics, Knicks, bulls at minimum. Calling them a potential 4 seed is downright delusional. Just because you‚Äôre a die-hard Toronto fan doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good. Get a reality check and some objectivity, god damn."
"most definitely not near his peak  very reductive thinking, and even if you go by what you said, take one look at westbrook and you'd see that you're wrong  kyle lowry and steve nash were also late bloomers so it evens out  rose plays way more cerebrally now, so imagine he could've actually worked on his game instead of rehabbing from injury all those seasons  he shot 41% from 3 this season  obviously not sustainable, but imagine he still could play acrobatically the way he used to, plus a respectable shot, plus the playmaking he offers now  dude was literally 23 when he got hurt lmao"
"probably an unpopular opinion, but I think 2011 Rose was near his peak, that's not a bad thing, his MVP season was great, but a hyper athletic guard that isn't a great shooter is going to peak earlier than say a Kyle Lowry or Steve Nash type.   Sure there is still room for improvement, better decision making, better defensive reads, and efficiency are all typically things that come with age, but I don't think he would have gotten a whole lot better than his MVP season. Compared to a guy like Grant Hill who looked like the next best player in the league and was continually improving up until his injuries."
Kyle Lowry.
"Bruh, look up our record without Kyle Lowry the past 2 years.  We have an overwhelmingly good record ‚Äî even against good teams ‚Äî without him.  The east is flatter than ever this year and I know /u/dirtydanotho is going to get crucified here but the Raptors are going to surprise a lot of people this year."
even that ain‚Äôt true. look at kyle lowry man. so inspirational
The Blazers would break 40 wins the season after LMA left  Khris Middleton the more intriguing piece of the Brandon Knight trade  Giannis would be good enough for people to learn how to spell his last name (on draft night)  Kyle Lowry future all star (during his first year in Toronto)
"It's the Basketball Hall of Fame. Not the Professional Basketball Hall of Fame. A lot of those guys with ""very good 3 year stretches"" also had great college careers,  and international accomplishments. Those all come into play.  Kyle Lowry is a perfect example.  I don't think he's a HOF off his professional career but when you account for:  6 All Star Games  1 All-NBA Team (3rd)  NBA Title  A Gold Medal  All-Big East Freshman  2nd Team All Big East  Jersey retired by Villanova  It becomes a lot more of a debate even though it's hard for me to look at Kyle Lowrys 14.9 and 6 as HOF worthy."
"Banking on an injury as a reason for why you‚Äôre correct is completely farcical, especially when randle has no chronic injury concerns. After having a great regular season you‚Äôre going to completely discount his achievements due to his performance in his first playoff series? He made 2nd team all NBA and the 4th seed with elfrid payton as his starting point guard. He has more talent around him now and more consistent play from the young guys, I truly don‚Äôt see the Knicks completely missing the playoffs. If anything the Miami Heat would be more probably to have injury problems with 36 year old Kyle Lowry."
Wait wtf when did Kyle Lowry go to the heat
34 year old Kyle Lowry who is on the hunt for one last ring before he calls it a career does not give a fuck about what you think Dallas is going to be like in 5 years.
Kyle ‚Äúbootycheeks‚Äù Lowry
Kyle Lowry üòâ
"First of all, what team besides the nets or Lakers isn't an underdog? even the bucks are underdogs cause they barely made to the finals this year and wouldn't have if KDs foot wasn't so damn bigYou people bitch bitch bitch every time one of them gets a star then you say arrogant shit like this when a star decides to go to one of the other very good teams instead of taking the easy way out and joining the nets. The heat have been a very good team these last several years. If oladipo is healthy and Kyle Lowry is healthy they literally would be the favorite in any other year besides the one where KD remembered he can't win shit without a warriors like team around him. So yeah, this actually could be about winning."
"Nah, lifestyle and weather weren‚Äôt the main reasons. It was more so that:               1.	Raptors are rebuilding and Kyle would much rather compete. It made sense for both sides to part ways. 2.	Miami was the best team that was willing to meet Kyle‚Äôs salary expectations. 3.	Kyle is the godfather of Jimmy‚Äôs daughter so he was going to play with one of his best friends in the league.  It was obvious since before last year‚Äôs trade deadline that Kyle was very likely going to Miami.         The reason that the trade didn‚Äôt go through at the deadline was because both Lowry and Masai knew the same options and more would be available in the offseason, so they held off."
"What's your 5?  Kyle, Olidapo, Butler, PJ, Bam?  On any given night Butler has proven he can be the best player on a championship team.  It just seems like he cant do it every night.  Maybe Lowry is the key to taking Bam to the next level."
Our playoff success depends on how much improvement Bam and Herro makes this season. Kyle Lowry will help with the development.
Reggie was bananas from deep in the Utah series but I wouldn't call him a floor spacing PG because I think that moniker fits a lot more of the George Hill/Kyle Lowry types than Reggie or Wall. Guards in our scheme are a lot more focused on drive-and-kick ability and require a certain level of athleticism because we have so much size that can shoot and we use Zubac in high PnR a fair bit.  I wouldn't hate Wall in a Clipper jersey for that reason. I think his floor is higher than Reggie's and I think you can afford to have 1 guy who isn't a deep threat if they bring other things to your offense. Maybe next offseason if he gets bought out we give him a look.
The Butler-Lowry connection definitely factored into the decision.  Kyle is the godfather to Jimmy‚Äôs firstborn.
"well yeah, Lowry had to change his role in the team when kawhi came on, everyone was calling him washed that season, only for his numbers to go back up soon as kawhi leaves.   Also, Sixers were the toughest team the Raptors faced to win the championship. Their defense shut everyone except kawhi down that series.   During the Bucks series you see Kyle come back to life."
"Not hate to like, more indifferent to my favourite player.  Kyle Lowry. When I started watching the NBA in the ‚Äò19 Finals, I thought of Lowry as a quick guard who could move the ball up well, but not much. Now, I understand that on top of the above, he is a great shooter (can pull up from the logo and fight you at the same time), playmaker, defender, leader, is insanely durable (18-6-8 as a 35 year old, IIRC). Fav player, everytime I wear his jersey I feel like I play better."
"im not a philly fan mate, i think they‚Äôre a bum organisation with bum fans.  I dont care about whats expected of the non number 1 options, this whole thread is basically about media slander.  Ben Simmons in sixers vs hawks game 7, Awful.  Jrue Holiday in bucks vs nets game 7, Awful.  Kyle Lowry in sixers vs raptors game 7, Awful.  Theres only one reason that only one of these games has been talked about literally every day on this subreddit since it happened and the other 2 performances went under the radar, and that‚Äôs because only one of them lost"
"Good thing Kyle Lowry offers much more than just scoring. There is a reason why Lowry has consistently led some of the best lineups in this league despite never being a volume scorer.                         Lowry being a very good defender, great floor general and leader was a huge reason why that team won a chip. Players like VanVleet, Siakam and Ibaka would have never been as good in our championship run if it wasn‚Äôt for Kyle hitting them up in their sports.            It‚Äôs funny to me that Kyle Lowry gets hate for not being capable of being a number \#1 scoring wise when the only guard capble of doing that in the league is Steph Curry.             Look at Lillard‚Äôs playoff struggles, or Kyrie‚Äôs in Boston. It‚Äôs very obvious that you can‚Äôt win a chip as a point guard without a top 10 wing/center. Now play these next to a LeBron or Kawhi and you will get a chip out of it."
"This is a list of guards who're all within 2 inches of Steph and clearly better defenders - Kyle Lowry, FVV, Fox, Cory Joseph, Schroder, Delon Wright, Hali, Beverley, Jrue, Smart, Conley, Neto, Rubio, Jevon Carter, Kris Dunn, Dinwiddie, Rozier, Donte, Caruso, KCP, Brogdon, Josh Hart."
Pretty sure he had a jacked up elbow the size of a baseball bat: https://www.raptorshq.com/2016/3/28/11322142/injury-update-kyle-lowry-on-his-banged-up-elbow
"What yips?          Raptors were pretty much only losing to prime LeBron. These are Lowry‚Äôs shooting stats in those 3 series against Cavs:         20/5/4 on 47/35/70 shooting         20/2/8 on 56/67/90 shooting         18/4/9 on 56/46/86 shooting          If by yip you mean playing next to DeMar, then yeah, Kyle had yips.           Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Lowry absolutely had bad games here and there, but he wasn‚Äôt really put in a good spot when his costar was a net negative in playoffs year after year."
"kyle lowry   he had the yips bad a few years ago, it was a pretty widely covered thing  he got better"
"Depends on what exactly you'd define as a second option. For instance, Pascal Siakam was the second scoring option for the Raps in 2019 but Kyle Lowry clearly had a bigger impact on the game than him. I think CJ can be a guy that can get the team buckets but you're going to run into issues if he's the team's second most important player."
"Kyle Lowry for fouling purposes but then I notice how impactful he is to the Raptors, heart &amp; soul of the team"
"&gt;  Listen to your logic: If a player has to take breaks on defense to perform on offense, then he‚Äôs not a good defender (he may have good defense skills but he‚Äôs not helping the team on the defensive end).  Okay, so rather than refute my arguments, you've moved onto another unrelated and incorrect point.  Here's a fun fact:  FVV scored more points per possession more efficiently after Steph switched off of him.  Here's another fun fact:  Kyle Lowry scored fewer points per possession on lower efficiency when Steph switched onto him.  Steph is not an elite defender, I never made that argument.  But people who argue he's a bad defender don't watch his defense and don't understand how much your brain matters on that end.  &gt;  I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs terrible on defense, but he‚Äôs not a top 10 isolation defender just because some metrics rank him top 10.  Actually he's pretty good.  In the history of the finals, no player has ever been targeted as much on switches as Stephen Curry.  And there's a reason for that, it roughs him up and tires him for the other end, it's a strategy that works.  But in isolation in the playoffs (think LeBron and Harden) he actually held them to fewer points per possession on lower efficiency with more turnovers than their averages.  People think because they hunt him that he's a bad defender.  They hunt him so he doesn't drop 40 points in 22 shots on offense.  They hunt him because their other options were Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston etc.  He does particularly well against stronger, taller players because he's stronger than he has any right to be and a low center of gravity relative to them.  People like JR Smith embarrass themselves trying to take advantage of that ""mismatch"".  Does that mean he's going to stop LeBron a meaningful amount?  No, he needs serious helpside to guard a 6'8 monster like LBJ.  But he does a pretty good job of holding his ground until help rotates or steering him into more defenders."
"Lol, one isolated instance that you didn‚Äôt understand and you‚Äôre opinion is formed, huh?  With Klay and KD injured Steph was double and triple teamed every play.  Steph didn‚Äôt want to guard FVV because FVV runs all day off ball and Steph needed his energy for offense.  He switched onto Kyle Lowry who is a genuinely better player.  Is that the situation you‚Äôre talking about?  Because the context completely invalidates your point."
"Kyle Lowry - fucking flopper...but now he's on my favorite team, so...O\_o"
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Bam Adebayo  Key Bench Players: Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, Max Strus, Markieff Morris, Dewayne Dedmon"
"That team had depth which none of our rocket teams had. McGrady wasn‚Äôt a selfish player he was always good at facilitating on a team with more options he would have chose his shots smarter and moved the ball more. Also the wing defenders are insane, artest/battier/mcgrady swarming you and a young kyle lowry, oh and don‚Äôt forget 7‚Äô6 yao is waiting in the paint. What coulda been"
"&gt; If you don‚Äôt retire his jersey I don‚Äôt even know who‚Äôs jersey you‚Äôd retire  I don't disagree with the idea that DeRozan's number should be retired, but the obvious answer to this question is Kyle Lowry. Since he's older, he will be (and should be imo) first. But DeRozan won't be far behind."
"Kyle Lowry should be the first Raptor to have their jersey retired. Had things gone differently with Vince Carter then perhaps him, but I don‚Äôt see that happening now."
"I‚Äôm not liking this trend of modern players being disrespected by this ‚Äúshould they have their jerseys retired?‚Äù trend lately   Kyle Lowry &amp; DeRoZan *are* the Toronto Raptors, if it wasn‚Äôt for them together putting Toronto in a place of contention over the years it wouldn‚Äôt be a discussion"
Kyle Lowry.
"Kyle Lowry, man I used to hate his early Raptors years. Was upset when they choose him over Dorazon, but the seasons they won a chip  realized what he does for a team. Hate to see him leave the league when it happens."
Lebron is a great guy. Of course he says that. As a player you would have to be a dick to say otherwise.  I don't see Masai doing it. He knows (like everyone else by now) what drove the Raptors success in the teens was his drafting/players development and Kyle Lowry. And based on how high he sets the bar for the organization it would be a direct contradiction to reture Demar's jersey. Harsh but true.
Well he‚Äôs not on the team anymore but I‚Äôd say Kyle Lowry. He did so much for Toronto but I feel like Toronto gets shunned.
"Oh, people think raptors fans are debating this?  Lowry will get his, then DeRozan, and then Vince will get his.  The only reason Vince hasn't gotten his yet is because he can't get his before Kyle and DeMar."
"Ohhhh I see, so you have no idea what I'm talking about.  Fans are not a wall, fans would have made Kyle Lowry stand closer to the Tacko Wall.  Go watch any inbound in a regular season and compare it to that play. Look at how much closer to the sideline [Batum is on this shot](https://youtu.be/mejFtEY5faU?t=10) than [Lowry is here.](https://youtu.be/t0aLmBCXoqA?t=117) Lowry literally steps and hops forward to get into the pass, which wouldn't be possible on the Batum side out position.  It's not much but it's a noticeable difference, and when you are launching a crosscourt pass over a 7'5 defender every little bit helps.  Also, JB's foot literally lands on the sideline, not in the 3rd row of fans lol"
"Kyle Lowry, took a while to appreciate his non flashy bulldog mentality and playstyle but he‚Äôs amazing"
"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"
I like how you conveniently forgot to mention Kyle Lowry or even Trent Jr
I (probably should be less lazy and just look it up) can't remember but wasn't the Raptors winning season the one that talking heads were foaming at the mouth every time Kyle Lowry scored low in a playoff game? (if you remember any narratives) IIRC was literally the postseason that made me stop watching ESPN lmao.
"A few reasons:  * Toronto fans (no matter how much we'll say we don't) have a chip on their shoulders about desirability of our market. The idea is that we think they've built a world class org and we can't lure a Free Agent for shit. Simmons leaking or people inferring that he doesn't wanna go there cause it sucks fuels that resentment * 76ers fans have been real chirpy about the potential Kyle Lowry trade at the deadline, calling Masai and Webster nuts for what they asked for, talking shit about how its better that they didn't trade him etc. So seeing the 76ers in a spot now is cathartic for guys that took that personal. * The leaked trade offer (Lowry, FVV, OG + 4th pick) regardless of how much it was a first bargaining position from Morey felt insulting to people, like 'here's what you're worth, here's what we think of your team"" and for people who love their team, that feels shitty. * Ben is the opposite of what Raptors fans feel our team culture is: Hardworking, underrated guys driven to improve within a quality system. Regardless of whether you buy the hype that Raps fans sell on our team culture, Ben is the opposite of that. Naturally gifted but seemingly aloof, lazy and above it all. * 76ers have been loud all year (multiple years tbh) about how sick Ben Simmons is (DPOY! Multiple All Stars!) and now them being in the barrel on him creates some schadenfreude + the previous reasons centres it on Raptor fans."
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
KG and Kyle Lowry
"&gt;Kyle Lowry was considered a very good player in the regular season and a choker in the post seasons    Only people who never really watched him thought this. He's had occasional bad shooting nights in the playoffs, but he's importance to a team isn't merely scoring. Hell, even in the playoff game against Orlando when he scored zero points he had the highest +/- out of either team.     And people forget for all the flack that him and DeMar get, the took the 2016 Cavs (you know ""cleveland this is for you"" team) to 6 game in the ECF.  Including having a monster game in game 7 against Miami and hitting a shot in Wade face to eliminate them."
"&gt; Kyle Lowry was considered a very good player in the regular season and a choker in the post seasons  This was not deserved. He had pretty good numbers, there were a lot of games where DeRozan just straight up shot them out of contention."
"could you name them ? im sure most people would rather have Dame, Trae, Luka, Steph, CP3 and Kyrie than Kyle Lowry, that's more than half the list lol"
Kyle Lowry lol
"Kyle Lowry was never a choker in the playoffs, that is some ‚ÄúI watch espn but not games‚Äù bullshit."
"At the time, I remember the big thing in the analytics world was win shares and wins produced. His last two seasons in Houston his win shares and wins produced were the same level as Deron Williams who was considered one the best PG's in the league at the time. Collison always just projected as a middle to below average starting guard in comparison. The other move the Raptors made in the season they traded for Kyle Lowry was Landry Fields, who also was big in win shares. He just got injured and was never the same."
Kyle Lowry
"Because the way you're ranking based on these stats is misleading. The next ranked point guard in EPM is Kyle Lowry. The next ranked point guard in LEBRON is Jamal Murray. So saying he's only 18th as if that means he's in bad company is wrong, because I think you'd hesitate to say that Lowry and Murray are below-average point guards in the league.   A number of backup PGs are higher than them, because those stats show how well someone performs in their role - for example, De'Anthony Melton is ranked higher in LEBRON than Jamal Murray. Does that mean the nuggets should trade them and start Melton? No, it just means Melton is probably a good backup PG. We shouldn't use them as bona fide rankings, it's more important to see what percentile the player is in and whether or bot the number is positive. Lonzo's in the 89th percentile for EPM and is a positive in all three major advanced stat - that's solid evidence that he's a valuable player."
Lol imagine giving up young players and picks for 35 year old expiring Kyle Lowry
"Raptors are no longer buns, we traded Kyle Lowry."
"The last time they approached the Raptors they were asking for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft.   Which is just absurd. Even a FFV, OG, Barnes trade would be too much for Simmons.  Your idea probably would be a win/win for both sides, but unless the 76ers come to earth a trade ain‚Äôt going to happen."
"&gt; A couple of years ago, Kyle Lowry told ESPN‚Äôs Kevin Arnovitz about a move‚Äîhe‚Äôd dish the ball to his big man, and grab the arm of that man‚Äôs defender so his defense would be impaired. Lowry had noticed, through the years, that for whatever reason referees seldom call that foul, which results in an artificially clean look for the Raptors. Lowry did the move enough he had a name for it: the dish and grab.  PnR vs DnG ü§î"
"I mean, what are the big tactical errors that Rivers made against Atlanta? Philly's starters won their minutes. The bench is a dumpster fire. They don't have anyone that can carry a bench unit so Rivers is essentially just throwing shit at the wall and hoping they can squeeze out something from Harris, or one of Maxey or Shake get's hot.   The roster is incredibly flawed. The best perimeter player on the roster is Seth Curry who was getting played off the court by Kevin Hurter. Instead of Kyle Lowry, the deadline reinforcements was Geroge Hill who looked competently washed and gave Philly nothing.   And, I haven't even mentioned the second-best player on the roster crumbing like a cookie and not even really playable down the stretches of games.    I think last year we saw a similar roster issue. In that, the Clippers just couldn't match up with Jokic. The Clippers had one center on the roster Zubac who got in foul trouble a lot. The only other option at the centre was Trez who just completely annihilated by Jokic.    I feel like a lot of this criticism is pretty unfair, and doesn't really come with much of Doc should have done X,Y or Z."
Was Kyle Lowry busy or something?
"As you say it's theoretical, but tanking and acquiring assets is the easy part. The hard part isn't Sam Presti acquiring every pick in the league it's turning those picks into a contender. Hinkie never had to do the hard part so we don't know.   Do you trade Jason Tatum for Kawhi? How about for Anthony Davis? Do you trade up for Markel Fultz to finally solve your guard problem? How about trade for Jimmy Buttler? Sign Al Horford? Trade for Kyle Lowry? Hinke never had to make any of those hard decisions. He essentially gets to have a reputation for being a genius for doing a long tank job and never had to make any of the hard choices that carry risk. All the risky moves were made by others and they get the blame for them not working.  Personally, I don't think Philly would be significantly better off. Despite Philly fan's consternation most of the moves over the last 3-4 years have been pretty defensible. You have to take some risks to turn a rebuilding team into a contender a lot of times those moves won't work out."
"&gt;	widely considered a top 3 defender in the NBA   By who? The media? The Raptors have always been disrespected. The 2019 team was the best defensive team in the playoffs since the 04 Pistons, yet the only player who made all-defence was Kawhi (which most agree was a rep vote, many thing Pascal deserved it over him). In 2020, despite being the best defensive team, no Raptor made an all defence team. IIRC a media member said the Raptors as a whole were so good defensively so they didn‚Äôt vote anyone for All-defence. FVV, OG, and Pascal all deserved consideration for an all-defence team that year. Also the fact Kyle Lowry has 0 all defence teams is absolutely bullshit, and shows the disrespect the media shows.   Ben begged his way to being second on DPOY voting last year. I don‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs the best defender on his team, and I‚Äôd definitely rank Gobert, Draymond, and Embiid ahead of him. OG is quiet, not a number one pick all star who gets a lot of attention, and as such, no one notices that he‚Äôs one of the best defenders in the league. What a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is that there‚Äôs a solid chance that OG is overall a better player than Ben this season (bias take but I do truly believe it). Ben is a great defender, but OG is absolutely at his level, and I‚Äôd argue he‚Äôs a better defender because he can actually do some sort of rim protection , whereas Ben cannot."

"&gt;In the same season that Chris Paul took the Suns from bums to contenders, people were doubting Kyle Lowry's impact on elevating a team **when he's almost the same player.**  Kyle Lowry and CP3 are almost the same player??"
"How's this for a twist: after Masai took over in Toronto, he started making his team, which was no big deal since the existing roster was not doing much. After having moved Bargnani to the Knicks in the offseason, his first move during the 2013/2014 season was to trade Rudy Gay, not because he was bad but because him and Demar overlapped too much and they were looking to tank. The Ironically, the Raps looked a bit better in their next few games. A month or so later, the next move was to trade Lowry to the Knicks. That deal was done. Lowry was packing his bags.  But at the last minute, the Knicks owner, James Dolan, called off the trade, fearful of being embarrassed again after the Bargs trade. It was too late for any other trades, so Masai smoothed things over with Lowry, told him that he should take this as a wakeup call to change his attitude, and suddenly the raps surged into the playoffs.

"Why'd they downvote you lol, that's true, Kyle Lowry shouldn't be compared to the level of CP3 but he sure as hell is better than Dragic"
**SHOCKING:** Kyle Lowry sexually harasses his teammate Jimmy Butler.
"You can't even call this hindsight. It's not like he's a breakout player. Kyle Lowry is a known quantity. He's a floor general, tone setter, fuckin dog after a bone, known winner, and he would've laid it all out on the court for his hometown. Morey is a moron because that's exactly who Joel Embiid needed next to him, not whatever Ben Simmons is."
"A lot of Raptors fans tried telling people this and the fanbases of the teams that did pass on him were entirely full of shit about it. Saying that it wouldn't have made a difference, that Raptors fans were acting like homers, completely ignoring that Kyle Lowry was the #1 playmaker on a championship roster that had one of the toughest paths to the ring (aside from the finals) just two years ago.  The guy is an absolute game-changer and has skills that don't age. In the same season that Chris Paul took the Suns from bums to contenders, people were doubting Kyle Lowry's impact on elevating a team when he's almost the same player.  People are going to see this year what the Sixers missed out on last year. Every time he makes a disgusting needle hole pass, every time he takes a clutch late-game charge, everytime he bodies a guy twice his size while fighting for the ball, people are gonna see it."
ESPN: Jimmy Butler shoves new All-Star teammate Kyle Lowry in heated sexual dispute following injury
I‚Äôm glad other NBA fans are seeing how great of a player Kyle Lowry is. Advance stats had him as a top 15 player in the league year after year for a reason.          Kyle and Jimmy are going to make some noise this year.
Kyle lowry is in midseason complaining form!
It‚Äôs the Kyle Lowry Effect
He became KYLE LOWRY when he said YAY-YA-HEY
Every Raptor fan should buy a Kyle Lowry Heat jersey for his first game here. Just sayin'.
"My brain and memory knows he was a Grizzly and Rocket, but it feels like he only ever played for us. He became KYLE LOWRY in Toronto and it still hurts to know that he's gone.   I don't like the Heat even one iota, but part of me will be cheering for them solely because of Kyle."
DeMar comforting Kyle Lowry on the ground after getting his game-winning layup attempt blocked at the end of Game 7 against the Nets in 2014
"Honestly it seems like it‚Äôs going to effect a few of the shorter point guards that were deliberately using their small frame to manipulate the refs into calling fouls.   Guards like Lowry,Harden,Young,Steph  and Dame are going to be the most affected by this.   Kyle actually tried to do the jump into defensive player in our game the other night and was arguing with the Ref. I also saw Steph try it in their first game and complain to the Ref.  This isn‚Äôt going to effect SG‚Äôs,Forwards and Centers who attack the basket. They will still call those fouls. Also i saw them call fouls where it was shooters getting hit on the arm. So...basically they aren‚Äôt going to call cheap fouls anymore."
"Kyle Lowry was 15-31 as a starter last year. I‚Äôm not saying that he‚Äôs bad at all. In fact, I think the Heat are probably the third best team in the East now because they acquired him and I wouldn‚Äôt be that surprised to see them back in the finals. That being said I don‚Äôt think he should be immune from criticism when he, quite frankly, underperformed last season. If the reason he‚Äôs considered great is because the teams he is a part of ‚Äúalways win‚Äù he should be getting equal criticism for when his teams lose."
"&gt;Are you actually trolling? Yes, the Grizzlies were 100% trading JV, their supposed best player, for a chance at Kyle Lowry, an aging vet who does not match up with Ja/JJJ at all and best case scenario is a 1st round exit.  I was clearly talking about the Pelicans.  &gt;They traded **for** JV to improve their team and clear capspace to make a run for Lowry   Again learn to read.  &gt;Do me a favor and never comment in this sub again  I wonder which team you will be bandwagoning next year?"
"Kyle Lowry-Devin Booker-Robert Covington-Ben Simmons-Porzingis  3 high level defenders, 4 willing and able shooters around Simmons, rim protection with KP and Covington, and 2 playoff tested shot creators to make up for Simmons lack of skill in that area. Also 2 elite level passers and a very good one in Booker   It really depends a lot on if you think KP can get to a better defensive level than he‚Äôs show in Dallas though, you could swap him for Myles Turner but you‚Äôre losing some of the shooting upside"
And to think they could have had Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶
"At absolute best, he is the 9th best PG in the league.   Curry, Luka, Trae, Lillard, Kyrie, CP3, Jamal Murray, and Kyle Lowry have all carried teams on playoff runs and series wins, which Simmons is not capable of doing.    For that reason, I don't think it's possible to rank Simmons above any of them.   Next, these other PGs can be argued as being better than Simmons as of today, but aren't clearly better: SGA, Westbrook, Fox, Morant, Mike Conley, FVV, Rozier, Rose.   Personally, I would only take SGA and Fox over Simmons from that list. So for me, Simmons is the 11th best PG in the league. If your PG is the 11th best PG in the league and you have him for 4 more years on a max.... your team is totally fucked.    Where would you rank him among PGs?"
"Kyle Lowry is the greatest Raptor ever, 2019 Kawhi is at least 69 times better, doesn't mean shit"
The Kyle Lowry being a pick for the rockets shouldn't count he became the raptors goat after leaving Houston

"Sir, Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt a spot up shooter.  For instance, he will not run to the corner like some third option, bitch.  You think this is JJ Redick? Rather he is the human embodiment of a deified Steph Curry returning, except he is not a pussy; as he will not hesitate to shoot from the logo while simultaneously engaging in fisticuffs."
"Steph, Trey Young, Harden, Luka, Kyle Lowry all come to mind for me"
He‚Äôs a taller Kyle Lowry .
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Lmfao he‚Äôs a magic fan bro, gotta lowe them. They have a huge chip against toronto, its pretty jokes tbh. They literally say ‚ÄúFKL‚Äù as like a mantra (meaning fuck kyle lowry) and this kid has an aaron gordon flair. Definitely a raptors victim, lowe him."
"Redick tied it at 85 with a three-point play with 3:29 left. Nearly two minutes passed before the next basket, Leonard's long jumper with 1:41 to go that was initially ruled a 3, but changed to a 2 after video review.  On Philadelphia's next possession, Kyle Lowry forced a steal near midcourt and fed Siakam for a fast-break layup, giving Toronto an 89-85 lead with 1:14 left.  Butler made one of two at the line and Leonard missed a pair of jump shots, giving the 76ers the ball down 89-86 with 24.1 seconds remaining. Embiid was fouled and made both, cutting it to 89-88 with 12 seconds left.  Leonard was fouled with 10.8 seconds left. He made the first, but missed the second, setting up Butler's tying layup.  ""We did a lot of things that we could have done better but we found a way to win the game,"" Lowry said. ""That's all that matters.""   ESPN recap  Joel Embiid was in for all of that fyi  When I say that the Raps had all the momentum going into OT I wasn't theorizing, that's just tact the defense suffocated the Sixers who were feeling the moment"
"I mean a 6th man isn‚Äôt a bad thing if you‚Äôre starting guards are Kyle Lowry and one of the best 3pt shooters in the league in Duncan Robinson, unless you think Butler is the other starting guard and Robinson is the 3. 6th man of the year award is impressive I would think? And honestly a really good 6th man is huge for teams"
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever. Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind), so I expect him to have the same impact Jrue had for the Bucks.

All Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then. Khris Middleton did have good series. Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat."
it‚Äôs literally a classic kyle lowry copypasta already
"&gt; Kyle Lowry  disagree. He's a master at both play making and defense.  He's at the top of the league on both of those account. Despite his short stature, he's an amazing post defender (only guys he can't defend there are true post-playing centres). And his team playing on both ends orchestrates and runs the team.    Yeah, he does a lot of the little things amazingly as well. But in terms of play making and D... he's a master."
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time  :(

Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry is the best swiss army knife but for role players yes its Batum
All star: Gordon Hayward and Kyle Lowry  Role player: Harrison Barnes and Nic Batum
"&gt;great defence even when they had a poor match up  Definitely.   Hell, the play literally ends with Kyle Lowry boxing out Embiid to secure the rebound."
Pro tip  Always watch Kyle Lowry on NBA TV. Thank me later.
Bro Kyle Lowry was 20 pounds overweight and publicly beefing with his coaches about his attitude and work ethic.  Not sure where in hell you got that take...
"I don‚Äôt think they were a trash team in the traditional sense. But compared to most championship teams over the past 30 years, they are without a doubt one of the weakest teams. I was answering the question posed here, so I may have used some hyperbole. They were obviously a good team because they had one of the best records in the East, even when Kawhi was not playing due to load management (much like his first year in LA). But they were a team that was built in a way that had some glaring weaknesses. The lack of star power chief among them. Siakam had not emerged yet and Marc Gasol was well past his prime. Kyle Lowry is a second tier point guard in that he cannot take over games and certainly cannot be relied on to consistently give you 25 points a night. I mean, seriously‚Ä¶ who was the second best player in that team? Lowry? Or Siakam? Either way, not really prize players. Siakam was young an inexperienced. He‚Äôs obviously got a high ceiling but he wasn‚Äôt there yet (and still isn‚Äôt quite there now). Lowry is a net positive in terms of how he impacts the game but ultimately he‚Äôs a dude that‚Äôs giving you 14 a night on 41% shooting and his assist to turnover ration is found wanting.   So ask yourself. Looking back on the last 30 years, which teams would Lowry and Siakam be the second and third best player? I‚Äôll answer that: NONE OF THEM.  And I‚Äôm not attacking the Raptors. I rooted for that team because Kawhi is one of my favorite players. And I hate the Warriors. And I love Jeremy Lin (I‚Äôm from NY) and always hope for the best for him even if he wasn‚Äôt really getting much playing time there. And I would have like for Greg Monroe to get one too, even though he had been traded (still not sure if he ever got one‚Ä¶ I know the Raptors were pretty stingy with giving out those rings). But I was answering the question posed by OP. When you look at this Raptors team, they are certainly one of the lesser Champions of the past few decades."
"An even crazier one:  At the end of the 2012 season, Andrew Bynum had been the Lakers full time starter for 4 years. He had two rings and was coming off a 2nd Team All-NBA season with 19/12 averages.  At the same time, Kyle Lowry had fewer than 140 career starts and was competing with Goran Dragic for minutes on a mediocre Rockets team, re-Harden.   Since that point, Lowry has made 6 All Star teams and won a championship. Bynum played a total of 26 more games and hasn't played in almost 7 years.   Lowry is 19 months older than Bynum."
"Despite being the same age and from the same draft class (3 picks apart), the primes of Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo never overlapped. They never appeared in the same all-star game."
"He's a very good passer, and if he didn't have the level of scoring gravity that he does (say, if you took away his elite three-point shot but left him his slashing ability, so he's still a scoring threat but doesn't yank defenders away from their man the way he does), he'd still be in the upper echelon of playmaking PGs in the league. Sort of on the same tier of a Kyle Lowry or a Ja Morant, guys who don't average 10+ assists but can still make elite reads, even if he's a bit turnover-prone.  When you *are* including gravity, though, he's absolutely up there with the best playmakers in the league, despite the lack of counting stats."
"Game 6 in that series is honestly my favourite Kyle Lowry game ever. Obviously he was great in the championship run but for a one-game performance, the one in the Celtics series gotta be it."
Kyle Lowry is the same calibre as Chris Paul easily
"This is a first take type of take. If you watch the games, you can clearly see the difference between the two. Jrue abused Chris Paul and Devin Booker defensively while Bledsoe was getting cooked by the likes of Terry Rozier and Kyle Lowry (respect to Lowry but he ain't in Chris Paul's category)."
"I seriously believe he signed the vet min to benefit from the Kyle Lowry effect. Kyle brings out the best in players, and those players go on to get bags. They then sign somewhere else and play like crap because he is no longer helping them shine. I.e. Biyombo and Ibaka."
"Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jimmy Butler."
"Kyle Lowry. If he played in the west rather than the east during his peak, we would be talking about him in the same vein as Mike Conley. He‚Äôd still be a great fringe all-star level player, but not this HOFer some argue for."
"I say this every time but it‚Äôs true.  Has to be Kyle Lowry, never seen a player praised this much on this sub compared to other platforms. I‚Äôve just never heard those takes about him outside this sub."
The beginning of the washed Kyle Lowry era
"Just a shower thought, what would be the lowest possible NBA player comparison for a 1st overall pick?  Like if a college kid was the next ‚ÄúKyle Lowry‚Äù would team use 1st overall pick on him?"
Honestly Kyle is gonna be so good for Bam‚Äôs game. Heat fans are really gonna enjoy it if Lowry can stay healthy.
"Kyle Lowry, Duncan Robinson, Oladipo, Jimmy Butler, Bam, Tyler Herro, PJ tucker.   What a squad"
Kyle Lowry might have to retire
"Not sure about Batman, but Kyle Lowry can be Buttman"
"If people are debating whether Rajon Rondo or Kyle Lowry deserve to be in the HOF, Chauncey has a marginally better resume than either of them. I think he's in."
Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt the leader of the Raptors?   And google ‚Äúleader of the Clippers‚Äù Pat Beverly and Paul George are the names that appear.
"how are any of us making this distinction? Players like Duncan and Magic have had loads of praise and made clear immediate impacts. Players like MJ and Hakeem get talked about for their competitiveness. KG was credited with setting the celtics culture. Bill Rusell did a lot of leading. Nash/dantoni turning things around in phoenix. Kyle lowry gets talked about a lot.  it is a super complex topic, so someone stating bron as best in history just seems weird when we have plenty of negative examples and something like leadership is so vague all on its own."

"True. That villain Kyle Lowry, though. He should be ashamed."
Kyle Lowry will be in the HOF and they had very similar careers
"Somewhere in miami, Jimmy butler, Bam adebayo and kyle lowry are collectively punching air and exhailing violently."
"Current Favorites: Kyle Lowry, KD, James Harden  All-Time Favorites: Dirk, Kobe  Current Least Favorite: Pat Bev, Pat Connaughton  All-Time Least Favorite: Paul Pierce"
"it boggles the mind why Philly didn't go for Kyle Lowry.  &amp;#x200B;  A championship-level point guard with great shooting, decision-making, and even gets to the rim, who, though older, doesn't play above the rim so we shouldn't see a big fall off.  &amp;#x200B;  and he's from there.   &amp;#x200B;  Heck, they should've gotten Lowry the summer after Kawhi left. The Raptors were obviously rebuilding, they let everyone else that wasn't young go."
"""Westbrook &gt; Chris Paul and it's not even close!""  ""Kyle Lowry &gt; Westbrook and it's not even close!""  There we go"
"bro my team is paying $53 million to Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry so they can NOT shoot 3's and make ""hustle plays"" all year, of course we suck  Oh wait. That's your team.  My team has bacon."
kyle lowry
"This is the unpopular but accurate take. I'm not convinced the Bucks are better than healthy Heat (short off-season, now have added Kyle Lowry), healthy Nets (obviously), or healthy Hawks (Trae going down with 2-2 series).   And there's no guarantee they'll face the weakest WCF winner in this millennium in the 2021 Phoenix Suns coming out of the West again"
"I guess NOP has the main grievance against Kyle Lowry, I guess Charlotte is the one that's pissed at Chicago, since they would've wanted to make a run at Lonzo?"
Any positive Kyle Lowry takes.
"A small-ball lineup of Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Duncan Robinson, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo could be very interesting. The regular lineup with PJ could effectively do the same, but his shooting has been terrrrible recently."
I don‚Äôt expect him to become literally Kyle Lowry. I said I think he can have a similar career arc.
Kyle Lowry and Ersan ƒ∞lyasova. Charge City.
Kyle Lowry &amp; JJ Barea
"Just the fact that Giannis stayed and Kareem left is what does it for me. There‚Äôs a reason Kyle Lowry is considered the GOAT Raptor and not Kawhi, to use an extreme example"
This sounds like if Aaron Baynes said the passes from Kyle Lowry are hard to catch when they hit his hands. It's not *my* fault. Dude is actually 8 years old.
kyle lowry was consider one of the biggest chokers in the league and would still be considered that if it wasnt because of kawhi
Kyle Lowry
"Pascal came in looking at Demar and Kyle as big brothers and saw how that dynamic was on the court and relationship off the court. No matter what, Lowry is/was always going to be a big brother who could at anytime come down and snatch the reigns from Pascal. Pascal wants to be on the same footing as Derozan was in terms of freedom. The ball was put in Derozan‚Äôs hands for better or for worse, nobody questioned it. But we‚Äôve seen this past year even, Raptors fans exclaiming Pascal is not a #1, he‚Äôs a #2 and questioning his game &amp; standing with the team.   When Lowry sat last year, Fred and Pascal took over and had such great synergy to the point where it looked like it was time to move on from Lowry. Hearing it from Pascal and Fred solidifies what the eye test was showing. Lowry is GOAT and big dog eats first. But it‚Äôs time for the young pups to mature and get a chance to run the pack with no other alpha challenger. Lowry wanted his 30M deal so there was no way he was going take a back seat like he did for Derozan and even Kawhi."
Na Kyle Lowry been a bitchy flopper
"theres a difference between best and greatest, Kyle Lowry is the greatest raptor yet Kawhi is the best raptor"
Originally about Kyle Lowry I think
"Three way trade suggested by a lakers fan    Knicks get: KCP  Lakers get: Kyle Lowry   Raptors get: rj Barrett, Kyle Kuzma  This was last seasons trade deadline"
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
"I mean those types of players exist i just dont think they are availble. Jrue would have been a great fit, players like Jimmy Butler and Jaylen Brown playing at the 2 are great pairs for about anyone, honestly Kyle Lowry or Lonzo Ball both moved this offseason and could have slotted in to help take some pressure off Dames ball handling responsibilities during the regular season."
"When Kyle Lowry retires there's going to be a million iterations of ""I hate to watch you go, but love to watch you leave"" type memes, and I'm going to love it"
"    pg: Kyle Lowry -&gt; Rajon Rondo (2006)     sg: Duncan Robinson -&gt; Shai-Gilgeous Alexander (DR undrafted, using draft of rookie year 2018)     sf: Jimmy Butler -&gt; Kawhi Leonard (2011)     pf: PJ Tucker -&gt; LaMarcus Aldridge (2006)     c:  Bam Adebayo -&gt; Zach Collins (2017)  Feel like the only straight downgrade is Bam to Zach Collins. Spacing looks pretty rough, though."
Kyle Lowry is so overrated lol.
Jrue Holiday or Kyle Lowry would be the baseline for that I think

"I replied to another guys comment, which I can do because I'm not the idiot who said ""You want to know what I do when I see a comment I don‚Äôt like about my team or players, I keep scrolling...you know the thing you couldn‚Äôt do without getting sucked into this stupid back and forth"" as they go and reply to a comment they don't like about a different team. Practice what you preach, if you don't like a comment continue scrolling, like I did with the rookie Tatum spam, Caruso spam, THT spam, etc which have been more egregious than any Barnes posting. Keep that same energy with all the big fanbases my guy.  You are attacking flairs. ""every time the guy dribbles a basketball you Raptors fans try to validate your pick"". ""Raptors fans as a whole"", you take the lowest common denominator dumb fucks and brush anyone with a Raptors flair with it (attacking a flair), so let me ak you a question. Do you think Lakers fans as a whole were sucking THT and Carusos dick like every basic play they made was next level, or do you think that was the lowest common denominator idiots who did so? You are doing the whole Anti-Raptors circlejerk to counter the Raptors circlejerk (which I actually dislike outside of memes like comparing every NBA rookie to Flynn or Kyle Lowry aint a spot up shooter), which makes yall just two sides of the same circlejerking coin.   Pointing out that as a Celtics fan they have no ground to stand on is also a perfectly valid and reasonable point. Then you came in triggered af with your panties in a bunch like the snowflake you are. And your point wasn't ""Raptor fans are sucking their role players dicks"", you were bitching about there being too many Scottie Barnes posts like he isn't the 4th overall pick and only had one singular post today which was his first NBA basket. Thinking you're a dumb fuck isn't the same as having your panties in a bunch, being a snowflake or triggered. You are clearly triggered, a snowflake and got your panties in a bunch over seeing posts of the 4th overall pick. Get over yourself."
Man. As a Kyle Lowry fan I tuned in completely forgetting my allegiance is now with Miami but this was a great game and that energy was crazy. I think the raps got me 4L
That first Kyle Lowry game back is gonna be something else man

"That‚Äôs true but don‚Äôt forget that we also already had Kyle Lowry (the GROAT) and JV, who was turned into Marc Gasol. Tross was turned into Ibaka. DD was turned into Kawhi. So we didn‚Äôt have a superstar but we had the foundation that needed a superstar.       I think where Masai has really shined is finding talent either late in the draft or outside of it. Pascal, OG, FVV, Norm were all such shrewd grabs. Now Barnes and Precious look really nice. It‚Äôs like Masai is constantly hitting doubles and occasionally home runs (Kawhi)."
Lakers should have pursued Kyle Lowry. He fits the team better.
"Kyrie + Drummond to MIA  Westbrook to BKN  Simmons + Mills to LA  Duncan Robinson and Kyle Lowry + 2 LAL firsts, + a MIA first to PHI   - MIA gets The best player + backup C - BKN gets OK3 - LAL get Younger + Shooting  - PHI gets picks + 3pt shooter + Hometown vet who can still play championship minutes. - ev1 get OK3 implosion or eventual rise  Who sez no (other than BKN probably)..."
"That's also a good point. Kind of like I mentioned to one of the other posters who replied to me There are a lot of aspects to this heat roster that have the potential, or in theory, to make them a real juggernaut. In theory Butler is a potential third team all NBA player still. In theory Tyler hero is an all-star. In theory Kyle Lowry is still an all-star caliber player. In theory Bam could be all NBA. In theory Duncan Robinson is the best three point shooter in the league. And in theory there's enough interesting pieces on the bench to allow them to survive injury. But also a lot of those could swing the other direction like you mentioned particularly with Butler. If he ends up topping out is barely an all-star or a fringe all-star this year due to regression and his ability to score and age are we ready to rely on Tyler and Bam to be primary scoring options on a hopeful championship contender? It's a big important question to ask."
He will benefit greatly from playing with Lowry. Kyle loves the 1-5 pick and roll
"It doesn't help to think about the Sixers with not only Jimmy, but also hometowner, Kyle Lowry."
Which we have seen again in his negotiations for Kyle Lowry and Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons isn't even worth a 35-year-old Kyle Lowry at this point lmao
Because Morey and the sizers overvalue their players to a ridiculous degree. They didn‚Äôt want to give up FRP or Matisse because they think Matisse can turn into Kawhi. Just like this off-season they wouldn‚Äôt give up Maxey for Kyle Lowry.
"do you think they could win with minnesotas offer? i feel like they could in a raptors style deep bench/depth, but i get the general vibe most ppl don‚Äôt. biggest flaw i see is the lack of a kyle lowry-esque decision maker that makes a difference with his bbiq."
what i learned from /r/nba  kyle lowry is thicc lakers have the worst fan base (according to this sub)
Kyle Lowry plays for the Heat? Since when
"Heat are going to go to the finals again:  1. They have one of the deepest teams  2. Tyler Herro is going to cook bench units alive  3. Kyle Lowry will bring much needed play making.  4. Bam should have taken a huge step forward.  5. Overall, they have no major weaknesses and can match up with anyone in the East."
"&gt; bums like Khris Middleton and Kyle Lowry, who could never play an important role in winning championship  They have both played important roles in winning championships in the last 3 years..."
‚ÄúNo bro Kyle Lowry is actually as good as Chris Paul you don‚Äôt understand‚Äú  \- OP
Bro really think a 37 year old Kyle Lowry about to come in and fix all there problems lol.
Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt changing a sweep lol
He‚Äôs still way better than Kyle Lowry.
Idk this might be Brunson's best shot at starting on a team. Brunson for when CP3 retires wouldn't be the worst option. Brunson is gonna cost around 12-16 million a year. Unless he can prove he is a 6th man of the year candidate you don't pay guys like that to sit on a bench. And he might want to leave and start on a team someday anyway.   Defensively he's not amazing but he would definitely take a load off offensively for Booker. I love Brunson and he definitely deserves a shot at starting somewhere. I think he has a legit shot at avg 18/7 somewhere in the NBA as a starter on a good team. He's basically got a Kyle Lowry trajectory
Haha Kyle Lowry has a big ass!!! Haha.
Imagine thinking a 36 year old Kyle Lowry is in the slightest bit comparable to prime Chris Paul.
Why is this sub so obsessed with replacing every teams PG with Kyle Lowry and expecting him to make a prime Chris Paul-esque impact.
"I mean‚Ä¶ Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi, Siakam, Gasol? I guess you can replace Gasol with Valanciunas or something."
"You have to carry Willie Cauley-Stein and Ky Bowman to deserve the max in the NBA. This is a common fact that most people agree on, and I'm amazed teams are giving maxes to bums like Khris Middleton and Kyle Lowry, who could never play an important role in winning championships"
Most everything you just said applies to Kyrie Irving too.  Or Gordon Hayward.  Or Joel Embiid.  Kawhi Leonard.  Jimmy Butler.  Kyle Lowry.  And those are just the top of market names with annual 10-20+ game absences.  Tons more as you move down the food chain.  I'm not trying to make the case that Brogdon hasn't gotten injured a lot.  I'm merely pointing out that he isn't so far out of the ballpark of what is considered normal these days that it's not much of an impact on his salary.  Teams no longer consider missing 15-20 games that big of a deal because it's become so common.
Kyle Lowry ass pics
I wanna play that game with Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry and that TONKA truck of an A$$
"For those saying wiggins is a good contract, let's look at the contracts within 3 million of wiggins aav.   KAT  Klove   Brandon Ingram  Jamal murray  Cp3  Gordon Hayward  Wiggins  Embiid  Jokic  Dlo  Julius Randle  Kyle lowry  Demar derozan  Al horford  Jaylen brown  Of these players I think there's only kevin love and al horford that wiggins is definitely better than"
Not trying to antagonise but why do you think their defense will be scary good? I know this isn't you saying this bit right now but I don't get how Kyle Lowry is a criminally underrated star and a fantastic defensive player and yet also a lot of Raptors fans seem to think they'll end up *better* defensively without him.
Kyle Lowry  DeMar DeRozan  Vince Carter  Kawhi Leonard   Chris Bosh
I‚Äôd be all for that because it means either Jamal Murray or Kyle Lowry get a ring and both of those are excellent outcomes.
Kyle Lowry really doesn‚Äôt make the heat that much better
Not me. I don‚Äôt like Kyle Lowry
Finals MVP Kyle Lowry
"I remember Kyle Lowry doing this a lot for the Raptors. One play in particular he knew involved throwing a cross court inbounds pass to a wing, so Lowry covered the wing. The pass was high so the guy jumped but Kyle knew it was for him so he just waited on the floor and when the guy came down with the ball it was practically in Kyle‚Äôs hands and he took off with it"
"i actually can't. ain't no way Kyle Lowry is worse than VanVleet, Fox, and Morant. Don't get me started on Jamal Murray. No fucking way you believe that. I'd agree on Trae, I forgot about him.   Your list makes me think you prefer guys with a flashy bag of tricks. Also insinuating that LaMelo comes close to Lowry is just wrong, dude's done nothing yet in his career. In 5 years, yes he'll likely be better than Lowry."
"Jesus fuck Laker flairs have gotten even dumber lmao. Lowry has consistently done well in a bunch of the stats you mentioned, especially for his size and position and was at least [someone who has been discussed as being potentially all defence.](https://ca.nba.com/news/the-case-for-toronto-raptors-guard-kyle-lowrys-elusive-all-defence-selection/pfo1ximzimwx1whsll7e98984). You‚Äôve provided zero arguments other than a stat says that Spender Dinwiddie and Henry Ellenson are the best defenders in the league. You‚Äôve provided zero insight into the discussion and have consistently ignored anything I‚Äôve actually had to say. Despite this you try and claim the high ground lmao. You have nothing left to say to me now, but you had nothing to say to me in the beginning. You have nothing to say to anyone. You have never had a thought coherent or intelligent enough to be worth conveying to another human being."
"You see Kyle Lowry as a good defender that‚Äôs a you problem. In the real world, he‚Äôs terrible. And you haven‚Äôt provided one bit of evidence that‚Äôs he‚Äôs anything but except your flair"
"Wait. I thought the stats didn‚Äôt matter. Now they do? Ok I‚Äôll play along.   Btw, for perspective, this same stat site rates Kyle Lowry (109.9) around the same as notorious lockdown defenders [Steph Curry](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/steph-curry-defense-rating-last-five-years) (108.9) and [Joe Johnson](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joe-johnson-career-defense-rating) (109.8).  Another perspective worth noting, *one of us* spent money on a jersey with this mans name on it and one of us didn‚Äôt. Can‚Äôt ignore the bias the flair brings fam.   And he‚Äôs *not* a bad defender lol?! He‚Äôs about as good at basketball defense as you are at defending his terrible defense.   F. O. H."
"I mean, if we‚Äôre talking defensive metrics,[Lowry](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kyle-lowry-defensive-rating) has the better career [defensive](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/goran-dragic-defense-rating) rating, and a[better defensive rating](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kyle-lowry-defensive-rating-rank-last-five-years) over the [last 5 years](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/goran-dragic-defense-rating-last-five-years). (Defensive rating is better when it‚Äôs lower btw, just in case you didn‚Äôt know.) Also, if you‚Äôve watched any substantial amount of Lowry playing basketball and think he‚Äôs a bad defender than that says a lot more about you than it says about him. I still think you‚Äôre trolling though. I hope at the very least."
I was laughing until I saw Kyle Lowry in the middle of it all... my heart
"Here's my list, including bubble players  Should be guaranteed (retirees listed first)  * Tim Duncan * Kobe Bryant * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Jason Kidd * Allen Iverson * Paul Pierce * Ray Allen * Gary Payton * LeBron James * Kevin Durant * Steph Curry * Chris Paul * James Harden  Would be surprised if they didn't make it  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (not in the highest tier only because of age) * Kawhi Leonard * Dwight Howard * Russell Westbrook  I think should make it  * Dominique Wilkins * Reggie Miller * Dennis Rodman * Bob McAdoo  Youngest active player to consider  * Nikola Jokic (in the league for 6 seasons and has an MVP. Shaq only was in the league for 4 seasons before the top 50 list)  My Bubble  * Tracy McGrady * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Tony Parker * Dikembe Mutombo * Anthony Davis * Chris Bosh * Manu Ginobili * Chris Mullin * Chauncey Billups * Ben Wallace * Adrian Dantley * Alex English * Carmelo Anthony  Reggie Miller Group (active veteran players not good enough for this anniversary list, but might be good enough in 25 years after a full career)  * Damian Lillard * Draymond Green * Kyle Lowry * Paul George * Jimmy Butler * Klay Thompson"
During the midseason last year THT should've been converted to Kyle Lowry
"Yes, he would have.  But Ben would have complained that certain plays and sets would be for Lowry and that the game on the line plays would still not be for Ben.  Same complaints he had that they ran isos for Jimmy when the game was on the line.  Kyle Lowry can play off ball sure, but you‚Äôre not gonna have him off ball every play, and Ben is whiny."
"assuming i'm not an idiot and you mean kyle lowry, lowry has literally done nothing for the franchise yet, not sure why he would be on the team  as for ray allen, he was way past his prime and including him would be like adding blake griffin to the all time nets."
Not Sexton related at all but this (presumably same) anonymous scout also thinks that [Kyle Lowry wasn‚Äôt an upgrade over Goran Dragic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q8v0s3/anonymous_scout_isnt_a_fan_of_the_miami_heat/) so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre the most credible source
"It really shows how low the standard is for actually trying to understand basketball and how important different play styles are. Kyle isn‚Äôt flashy and doesn‚Äôt fill up the stat sheet, combine that with his prime being on a Canadian team and these people automatically think he‚Äôs just meh lol.   If only they actually watched us play basketball. Lowry has been the engine behind all of the 50+ win seasons we‚Äôve had this past decade."
"I mean he clearly did overvalue him, the trade they ended up making was much worse than anything they could've gotten at the deadline had they not asked for such a high price. Not sure how you can look at Gragic and Achiuwa and not be upset Masai didn't make a deal at the deadline. Lakers were injured, Sixers had a Ben Simmons FT problem and neither would've been solved by acquiring Kyle Lowry no matter how many times Raptors fans repeat it.   This is the same shit in every thread every time. But Masai gets no flack and it's just us and the Lakers and the rest of the NBA who fucked up lol. Lowry would certainly help many teams, but the fact that our second best player was a 33% FT shooter who struggled in the same way when we had Jimmy Butler, I'm not sure people know much about the sixers and why they lost against the Hawks"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/04/23/the-time-kyle-lowry-sat-on-multiple-courts-to-halt-raptors-practice/amp/  Pretty funny and I recommend the video if they have one of them telling the story.  ""Sits down Indian style, crisscross applesauce""   Hahahaha"
"That skill is so underrated.   LeBron, Harden, CP3, Dame, Luka, Trae, Kyle Lowry, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley etc.   There's a reason why all these guys, their team's offenses don't go through lulls and are built for the playoffs."
"&gt; Kyle Lowry when metrics had him as a top 10 player &gt;  &gt; Advanced metrics are really just modified versions of on/off for the most part these days  Lowry ranked higher in Box Score RAPTOR than in On/Off RAPTOR in 2015, 2016, and 2018. He was top 10 in Box Score RAPTOR in 2016 and 2018.  So it's definitely not just DeRozan, as the advanced impact metrics all adjust for teammate quality."
Ben Simmons issues on the floor in the playoffs are not solved by Kyle Lowry lol
"2011 playoffs, I substitute Luka for Nowitzki:  Kyle Lowry (Kidd)  Derrick Jones Jr. (DeShawn Stevenson)  Luka  Luguentz Dort (Shawn Marion)  Brook Lopez (Tyson Chandler)  Bench:  Jordan Clarkson (Jason Terry)  Brunson (Barea)  Carmelo Anthony (Peja)  Willie Cauley-Stein (Brendan Haywood)  Minimum contract veterans for the spots of Cardinal, Mahinmi and Brewer."
Kyle Lowry and Jean Segura playing in the same city would be too much to handle
Kyle Lowry once sat down in the middle of a Raptors practice and wouldn't let them continue. I like to imagine him doing that and saying he would stand up if Embiid and Simmons worked their shit out.
"Ya I mean I like Westbrook as much as the next guy but there‚Äôs still questions on how they will all fit together especially come playoff time. While Kyle Lowry + AD and Lebron would basically guarantee another championship, much better fit"
"Not to sound as a homer but imagine if he ever had kyle lowry. I think his best skill is actually being a floor raiser, making his teammates better around him. So just shuffle his minutes around and give him westbrook's role. Where he's mostly always with the bench when lebrons off. Its the missing piece i'm telling you"
"I dunno why the lakers didn't make the Lowry trade work, it seems like such a no brainer to me, I just don't get the Westbrook thing at all. Kyle and AD would be amazing"
"Kyle Lowry when metrics had him as a top 10 player   Advanced metrics are really just modified versions of on/off for the most part these days   And as crazy as it sounds DeRozan's advanced metrics were SO bad that they actually inflated Lowry's  For example: [http://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612761&amp;Season=2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=201942,200768](http://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612761&amp;Season=2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=201942,200768)  Lowry without DeRozan compared to neither of them is a +4.5, a normal total for a good player but nothing superstar level  But Lowry's on/off is inflated by how awful DeRozan's stats are, DeRozan completely bombs when on his own and deflates the ""Lowry OFF"" part"
Alright Imma ask you this: Kyle Lowry or Russell Westbrook all time?
The same Kyle Lowry that told Ben Simmons to meet him after the game? Ahaha
"Kyle ""Ligament"" Lowry"
Kyle ‚ÄúACL‚Äù Lowry
Kyle Lowry and maybe Mikel Bridges or something idk.  Edit:Clint Capela instead of KP for rim protection. (Tyson Chandler)
Kyle 'Epididymis' Lowry
Kyle lowry.. if yk what I'm talking bout
"Kyle Lowry wanted to be a scrotum for the Philadelphia 76ers, what's the big deal"
"I know it depended on whether or not he wanted to go to Dallas, but I felt like Kyle Lowry was the perfect fit for the Mavs especially since they are in win-now mode in the next few years, so 25-30m x 3 years really isn't that ridiculous considering he is a fairly durable guy.  He can play as the 2 alongside Luka to ease pressure off of him or run the second unit as a bench guy.  He doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective.  Unselfish and a responsible two-way player."
who gives a shit?   Jeff Teague became an all-star at 26. Kyle Lowry the same year at 28. does that mean teague is better?
"Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam‚Ä¶"
"Kyle Lowry is either overrated or underrated, there is no in-between"
"Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶  Ok nevermind, sixers still might have looked better on paper lol."
Demar Derozan. The Raptors took off like a shot at the same time Masai Ujiri and Kyle Lowry arrived and as the face of the team and fan favorite he was completely disproportionately credited with Toronto's success both by fans and the accolades he probably would not have received were he just about anywhere else at the time.
"I'd say that scoring is overall the least valued of the trio of playmaking/scoring/defending in general in most RAPTOR stats  Like they will have Rudy Gobert as the 2nd best player in the league and until the last season or two Kyle Lowry as fringe top 5  KD's never had good RAPTOR, if you look at their page they have KD ranked below Kyrie in terms of total rating"
"Billups has a claim for ""best guy on a championship team"" status (or at the very least, he won finals MVP). Kyrie does not. Not only that but he's never really accomplished anything in the playoffs without LeBron, whereas Chauncey clearly led or co-led multiple deep playoff runs.  Khris Middleton, Kyle Lowry, and Tyson Chandler were all the second best guy on a championship team. Doesn't mean much when the best guy is an all-time great."
1:Anthony Davis  2:Jokic  3:SGA  4:TH  5:Keldon Johnson  6:Kyle Lowry
I always felt like they needed a point guard that has a skillset like cp3 or Kyle lowry to be the 3rd option next to Simmons and embiid
Kyle Lowry *instructional* twerk videos
"Do 6'6 guys really lead the league in field goal accuracy?  Last I checked, the best shooters in the NBA are shorter than that, and the greatest shooter of all time is 6'3 in shoes.  Moreover, Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry are the same height as Iverson and are much better shooters.  Isaiah Thomas was *shorter* than Iverson and still shot better.  You also changed your argument.  First he had ""a great shot"", now you're saying he would've had one if he was six inches taller."
"Yeah, probably.  He doesn't really dominate people with either his length or his athleticism in general.    Meanwhile, Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry are listed as the same height as Allen Iverson and both were far better defenders in their primes, so clearly height isn't the magic bullet."
a mature Kyle Lowry is worth his weight in gold
"If I could use a relative comparison-scale with Steve Kerr at 1; Derek fisher at 5; Kyle Lowry at 10... Kenny would sit somewhere around say 6.  At his best, he was a respectable 3rd option of a 90's championship team and made a living at hitting open threes at the grace of Hakeem's gravity.   Objectively, having those nerves to hit big shots when it mattered could be Kenny's greatest quality - as you could imagine as a common characteristic with those comparisons I've listed.  I believe Kenny thinks of himself as someone as good or even better than a Kyle Lowry or CJ McCollum but the reality is he's a few notches below that caliber....and it's hilarious that both Shaq and Charles have had no problems reminding him of that haha."
Kyle Lowry bringing the complaining culture üòÇ   I‚Äôm a raptors fan y‚Äôall I love Lowry
Need Kyle Lowry to get traded ASAP
"Ok, but who would you take?   Kyle Lowry or Jake Paul?"
they are veterans. I'm shocked Kyle Lowry came with him.
70 - Kyle Lowry 69 - Kyle Lowry's Dumptruck
I'd swap Kyle Lowry in for Russ. Lowery may be short but the dude is crafty af.
"But you're still cheering for your favourite son Kyle Lowry, right?   One of the dirtiest players in recent memory."
[Potential trade back in March at the deadline](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) that the Lakers refused because they wanted to keep THT
He's a solid defender and I see his shit starting to fall once he gets a better feel for the nba game. Some guys just take a minute to adapt. I still think he's gonna be like Kyle Lowry.
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Gin√≥bili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

"Kyle Lowry probably loving the beef though, no one's paying attention to the goose egg he layed on the stat sheet.."
"Domantas Sabonis 1st year (20) 5.9 ppg 39% fg  Pascal Siakam 1st and 2nd year (22, 23)  4.2 ppg &amp; 7.3 ppg 50% fg  Julius Randle 1st year (injured) 2nd year (21)  11ppg 10 reb 42% fg  Giannis 1st year (19)  6.8 ppg 4.4 reb  41% fg  Kyle Lowry - didn't avg double digits points or more than 4.5 assist until his 8th year."
Khris Middleton to throw in another name that people haven't mentioned. And would agree with the people that said Kyle Lowry.  The way Lowry has become better and better even after hitting his (or what was supposed to be) prime is great to see
"Kyle Lowry and Chauncey Billups. Joel Embiid if u count being injured constantly, even though he‚Äôs always played well."
"[Police come quickly, Kyle Lowry tryna beat me up!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qq62ed/a_picture_of_heat_players_waiting_for_the_nuggets)"
"Lmao @ Kyle Lowry. I have a close friend of Aaron Gordon‚Äôs who told me a story about how AG knocked on lowrys door in the bubble after Lowry injured him on a cheap shot and took him out of the playoffs. Guess who didn‚Äôt answer the door?  It‚Äôs the bubble bitch, we know you are home lmao."
Kyle Lowry. I have hated watching him play ever since he was a Rocket.
"Heat pretend to be hardcore but have Morris playing dirty, kyle Lowry flopping everywhere, Tyler herro snarling while down 3-1 in a series, and Butler making everything about him that might be biggest collection of soft I've seen in quite some time. Bam is cool though"
"Also, lost in a lot of the ""hold me back bro"" from the Heat last night is that if Jokic's brothers really are trained MMA fighters (which is my understanding), they'd likely be able to literally put to sleep nearly anyone they wanted to that isn't also a trained fighter.  People, especially competitive athletes, really underestimate the difference technical skill makes during a fight.  Even Durant's body guard wouldn't worry me nearly as much as like Kyle Lowry get knocked tf out on live TV. Could you imagine the NBA having to respond to Jimmy Butler getting put in hold by one of Jokic's brothers in the middle of a game?   There's no way those guys get within 100 yards of the arena for the next game in Miami..."
‚ÄúHello police? Kyle Lowry is gonna beat me up‚Äù
&gt; in real life a pissed off kyle lowry would make short work of anyone not seriously trained in fighting.  Kyle Lowry or Jake Paul
"Police presence, Chuck. Hello Mr. Policeman, Kyle Lowry trying to beat me up."
Career assists. Stockton has 15806. There are only four active players that are close.  1. Chris Paul with 10377 2. LeBron with 9738 3. Westbrook with 8154 4. Rondo with 7445  After that it's Kyle Lowry with 6059
Kyle Lowry tryin to beat me up!
"Hello police, Kyle Lowry trying to beat me up"
Well jokers size difference makes him different than the average guy out there. in real life a pissed off kyle lowry would make short work of anyone not seriously trained in fighting.
I've seen a lot of people mention this as if we would've just won the championship like Toronto did.   Kyle Lowry and Marc Gasol were instrumental pieces of their championship run and we did not have reasonable facsimiles of those players.   Kyrie + Kawhi would not have worked as well as Lowry + Kawhi did.
lol Kyle Lowry is the least intimidating looking dude I‚Äôve seen in the league. I‚Äôm sure I could take him.
This is the most productive Kyle Lowry contribution vs the Nuggets
and who can even take seriously a 'ready to fight' kyle lowry
Kyle Lowry aint no spot up shooter
Kyle Lowry looks like he's realised he's at the front of the group
Is Kyle Lowry washed? Jk Jk lol
It's crazy that nobody here thinks Steph is old but Kyle Lowry? You hear his name and you think dinosaur but he's only a year older than Steph. It's probably how athletic and quick he is that we still think he's a youngster
Kyle Lowry on his Pat Bev just running around.
Joel Embiid ü§ù Kyle Lowry
lmao doesn't Kyle Lowry also hate Gordon? prob had something to do with it
or yknow kyle lowry 0-8 today lol
Kyle Lowry for 0 points in a 0-8 night. $30m man.
Kyle Lowry has a ring and a fat ass. A lot of you can't relate.
Kyle Lowry lowlights inconming?
"Kyle Lowry was so hot to start game 6, knew it was over then, fucking balled out"
Kyle Lowry is old but that dump truck is in its prime
Kyle Lowry ladies &amp; gents.
Literally Kyle Lowry. Clear as day as soon as Lowry left the raptors people would either be shocked how good he is and how good his new team is because nobody watches or respects the Raptors. Love Lowry killing it.
In what stratosphere is Langford ‚Äúessentially thybulle‚Äù Lmao that‚Äôs like saying Jalen Brunson is ‚Äúessentially Kyle Lowry‚Äù hahahahaha
LeBron could have had Kyle Lowry... just saying
I think a big part of it is that kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"What problem? They start Duncan Robinson, PJ Tucker, and Kyle Lowry who can all shoot 3's, Bam who does his work in the mid-range and interior, and Jimmy Butler who doesn't need space."
Kyle Lowry is much better than Dragic who is currently benched for a 2nd round rookie albeit a pretty good one
Because Kyle Lowry is a good basketball player...
Kyle Lowry holders must've been incredibly patient

Kyle ‚ÄúThe Butt‚Äù Lowry
He really does remind me of Kyle Lowry. Even has the no-hesitation 3p pullups
"Next Kyle Lowry in the making, I can dig it if I‚Äôm a Magic fan"
Kyle Lowry will join this club soon. Either this year or the very start of next year - 14362pts/4237r/6055a
"Funny to me how this sub stays on Kyle Lowry's wang even though all he's ever really done is get carried to a ring by Kawhi. Despite his early season struggles, I'll still take Russ over Lowry easily, THT not withstanding."
"I think you're seeing that teams with fewer stars and better all around rosters are performing better. I mean, the Heat are a good example. Is 35 year old Kyle Lowry a star anymore? I wouldn't say he is, but he's an incredible starting point guard. Jimmy is a star. Bam is too. But other than those two, Miami just has a really well-rounded and balanced roster. The same goes with the 76ers. Embiid is their only star, but they're surrounding him with a ton of good players to fill out the team."
This sub amazes me sometimes. Kyle lowry is not better than westbrook............hes a better fit next to AD and lebron
Kyle lowry. American media appreciating him 3 teams didnt wanna trade for him last year.
"some teams haven't even played ten games yet, it's way too early to be limiting your pool that much. jrue, jaylen brown, kyle lowry, and lonzo are all good players with decent season starts in the east, and then there's rj barrett and derozan (both listed g/f) who could challenge now"
"Hey man, not hate to the rockets, i just hate players that bait for fouls, its corny af, call me the kyle lowry hater extraordinaire."
That‚Äôs where all the problems lie. They chose THT over Kyle Lowry and Alex Caruso. No pressure THT but he better win MIP or something lol.
"Yeah, but then you trade him for a 40 year-old Kyle Lowry!"
Jazz broadcast graphic just said Kyle Lowry got a Technical
"Yea they were but warriors fans are even worse, they assaulted Kyle Lowry"
Better chance Kyle Lowry misses the rest of the season due to pregnancy than this
"What everyone fails to remember is that had they done the Lowry trade, the only guards on the roster would‚Äôve been Kyle Lowry and Alex Caruso. You‚Äôre not winning a Championship with only 2 guards.   P.S. I was not a fan of the RW trade, would‚Äôve much rather had Buddy Heidl and kept KCP instead of trading for Russ."
"Both trades were not good, but Kyle Lowry is Michael Jordan Kobe Shaq Wilt compared to Westbrook"
"Here is the Russ slander again. Every single year it‚Äôs basically how useless the guy is and then by the time the season has finished he has shown everyone how good he is.  Kyle Lowry is just not a better player than Westbrook like this thread has made it out to be. Does Lowry do things that would probably benefit the Lakers more? Most likely. If you were starting a franchise though no way you pick Lowry over Westbrook. I love Lowry and he‚Äôs the guy to win you a ring, but Russ has only ever been praised by everyone he has played with, and his go 110% no matter what is exactly what an aging, starved for energy team needs.  Lebron is basically the only Laker to play good, so it‚Äôs not like Westbrook is on his own. The team needs time to gel. Westbrook will come up big in moments we need him. If one of AD or Lebron go down, we will need Westbrook way more than Lowry."
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2938149-76ers-trade-rumors-phi-wont-package-maxey-thybulle-picks-for-kyle-lowry  Another report. This time from woj. If you think Maxey wasn't offered than idk what to tell you. Masai got greedy and wanted both Thybulle, Maxey, Green and draft capital which likely killed the deal.   He could have had Maxey, Green and draft capital and instead got Dragic and Precious. You can decide if that's a fuck up or not, but to me it clearly is.   Anyway, I'm done arguing this, gonna watch the birds. Have a good one"
so....u got nothing cause. came at me after 2 months just to tell me to keep yapping. all that shit talk all u got is keep yapping cause deep down yknow kyle lowry isnt better. he couldnt do what westbrook does. and after 2 months u still remember me. love you boo

Russ plays for the stat sheet. He‚Äôs not a winner. Kyle Lowry is. He plays for the team not himself. That was evident when kawhi showed up and his  scoring went down to make sure kawhi ate.
The Lakers will forever regret not trading for Lowry. Kyle + AD and Lebron would guarantee at least 1 title. I hope keeping THT and his 2 good pre-season games a year was worth it
"Switch Westbrick with Jrue Holiday on the wizards last year and they would have made the second round at least.   Jrue, Trae, dame, unvaccinated Kyrie, Schroeder, D Fox, injured Klay, CP3, Elfrid Payton, Kyle Lowry, lonzo ball, lamelo ball, even Ben simmons are each &gt; Westbrick"
"Except the Raptors wanted Herro and Robinson for Lowry. Which, while yes still a good trade, Miami did the smart thing by just simply waiting.  https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-trade-miami-heat-tyler-herro-duncan-robinson-offer  Side note, imagine if Carmelo did this instead. I mean with the Knicks."
"I mean Kyle Lowry is probably the 2nd best qb in the state of Florida... and if that snowbird ever retires or move to Brazil, Kyle can claim #1."
This is the kind of hindsight armchair analysis I see so often in r/nba.   It made no sense for the Lakers to trade ALL of their guard depth for Lowry at the time considering they were still one of the top seeds and were poised to make a title challenge if everyone was healthy. 36yo Kyle Lowry wouldn't have made a difference when half the team was out injured and whatever players we could use on the floor were given away for him.  I'm not gonna comment on the Hield scenario because this is 10 games into the season and I'm not a nephew who is gonna overreact without even a quarter of the season played.
if you think that you're underrating kyle lowry
Since when did r/NBA go soft on kyle lowry
"The Heat went from the 18th ranked offence last year to 3rd this year with the only other notable addition being PJ Tucker. Forget the scoring for a sec, his playmaking has been out of this world. [Here](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/10/29/22753097/kyle-lowry-miami-heat-jimmy-butler-good-start) is a very good article that goes into it in detail.   In terms of scoring itself I think it‚Äôs safe to say the efficiency will average out. He averaged 17 on 59 TS% last year and has always been an efficient scorer, which can‚Äôt be said about Russ."
Kyle Lowry 6x all star
Still pretty gay for that Kyle Lowry ass though
Kyle Lowry and Aaron Gordon have beef going back to the bubble.
"I said elsewhere, I don‚Äôt like seeing us blow leads, but this was less of a meltdown by us and more of the Celtics trying to chip away and come back. We outscored them by 17 in the first half, they outscored us by 14 in the second half  The good news is this looked like our best team win, and Luka and KP‚Äôs best game. Even Jalen who didn‚Äôt have a great game still hit his season averages last year. I really think after a couple summers in a row of flubbing free agency we very well might get bailed out by Brunson turning into some version of Kemba Walker/Kyle Lowry. He‚Äôs averaging 15/5/4 on 28 minutes a game this year. I say start him and have our lineup be Jalen/Luka/Bullock/DFS/KP  With THJ/Maxi/Brown off the bench, but stagger Luka and Jalen so they‚Äôre limited together, Jalen plays well with the 2nd unit. I‚Äôm not an NBA coach, but similar to Manu when he was a top 25 player in the league but not starting, but still playing 30 minutes. I think if we could Just always have Luka or Jalen on the floor at all times we‚Äôre a dangerous team."
"That's what happens when you trade a ball hog for a bench  (and when Kyle Lowry simultaneously decides to get his shit together, befriend DeRozan and start on his way to becoming the GROAT)"
Red/black shirt legend Kyle Lowry.
"Brought my friend to her first game last night. After like the third time Lowry chucked it full length down the court I turned to her and said ""Kyle is a better quarterback then whatever we see tomorrow."""
Those people are just using different words to tell you that they've never watched Kyle Lowry play.

"Most people aren‚Äôt winning titles, and Lowry only got one because of Kawhi.  Not a single person has said Marcus is better than Kyle. A leader needs to be able to call anyone out, and behind the scenes, practice and all you know Marcus is a consummate leader.  His game is more than taking a few bad shots"
"Good leaders lead by example. Celtics fans loved to bash Kyle Lowry and put smart on a pedestal. Yet Lowry is a consummate pro, unselfish, and leads by example instead of running his mouth and chucking ill advised shots. If Marcus smart is your leader you ain't winning no titles, there I said it."
Should have traded for Kyle Lowry.
"Same with a lot of veterans. They don‚Äôt unlock their potential until they find their way to a competent coaching staff. Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, etc."
Kyle ‚ÄúBarely better than Dragic‚Äù Lowry.  Now we know why some teams suck. They have shit for brains scouts
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Heat legend Kyle Lowry.
"maybe, but because they'd be hardcapped after S&amp;T-ing for him they'd still have to shed a lot of good pieces.  so the depth would be no better, but they'd have kyle instead of russ.  lowry probably thinks miami looks better, anyway."
Kyle Lowry is enough to change a team pretty significantly. You aren't the same team tbh.
This one is super petty considering my fandom. I don't want the Heat to win the title this year. You'd think I'd root for them because of Kyle Lowry. Heck I'm even a huge fan of Bam and Herro. But I don't want them to succeed because I dislike some of their fans. Some really got on my nerves with the Dragic thing and then it worsened when I saw some of them try to defend Markieff Morris. I got a huge kick out of the hEaT CuLtUrE memes to be honest. Kyle got his ring. If anything I'm rooting for DeMar and the Bulls. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
"Kyle Lowry wasnt all that good for us, let alone the immortalization he gets from this fan base. He tried to leave any chance he got, no one wanted him. He owes kawhi his whole career."
Boris Diaw is thiccer than Kyle Lowry will ever be
In true Canadian fashion Kyle Lowry goes South for winter
So he can guard Ja Morant 1 on 1? Or even old Lebron James? James Harden? KD? Chris Paul? Devin Booker? Jimmy Butler? Kyle Lowry? Paul George?
"Yup, but you won‚Äôt ever hear this sub admit that, even with Kyle Lowry averaging 10ppg on a $30million contract"
Kyle Lowry let men run trains on him every god damn game for his team!
he took 3 lol  refs didn't call the first one  they called the next 2  https://youtu.be/epDAizjxaoI  one on LeBron (not called) and then two called charges on Kawhi and Harden (Harden call kinda bs imo but REGARDLESS)  I love Kyle Lowry.
Hmm I wonder what the limit to boxing out is? Like when is the force too much to be considered illegal box out? Can Kyle Lowry just truck people with his massive butt under the guise of boxing out? Would it be OK to aggressively box out an opposing player at half court just to get in their head?
You‚Äôre not quite in the right headspace   Russell Westbrook would be a demon skill position guy. I could also see Kyle Lowry or Chris Paul being a 5-7x pro bowl safety.
"Kyle Lowry should be in prison for something he did at Cardinal Dougherty that school administration covered up. I don‚Äôt want to say it here because it might get me banned, but PM me if you want to know details."
"Yes the line is very thin and imo that's what makes it such a good trade in hindsight. There were a lot of complications with the trade: us trading away a perennial all-star who we drafted and developed, the lack of transparency around Kawhi's injury, and Lowry's souring relationship with the front office due to his best friend DeRozan being shipped off. Those are just to name a few.   Kyle speaks in this article about teams wanting to move the needle and it applies to both the Heat and the Raptors. The Lowry and DeRozan led Raptors had just been swept by LeBron in back-to-back years. The frustration was at an all-time high and it seemed like we had reached our ceiling back in 2016 in the Eastern Conference finals. Trading for Kawhi and Marc Gasol moved the needle and it worked. Obviously there was a lot of risk to the trade, but sometimes teams don't take risks and don't experience success for generations."

"Ok but it isnt quite the same when Kawhi Leonard, Ibaka, Gasol, or Kyle fucking Lowry are there lol. Why are people talking like this is the same roster?   Like LOLLL why didnt the Lakers win easier? Why didnt they just pass to that dominant big man who cant shoot fouls but is unstoppable inside? Oh? He hasnt been with the team in years?  No shit this doesnt work missing basically the 4 key parts to that defense depending on the opponent? lol"
Well Kyle Lowry had the last shot in game 5. If that shot goes in Raptors won 4-1.
"Its not as easy when you dont have kawhi leonard, danny green, kyle lowry, marc gasol, serge ibaka, either"
"SMH, Kawhi was fed those points. Any half decent SG could easily average 30+ next to prime Kyle Lowry on good efficiency, or at least league average."
"Miami.   Duncan Robinson and Kyle Lowry just miss all the open threes, so it doesn't look as good as Golden State's."
That's not a terrible Kyle Lowry statline though
Kyle Lowry. The man is a walking definition of leadership and hard work. Such a lovable personality plus you can't help falling for him after he started taking charges...at an all star game!!  The guy makes everyone better and loves when they get a bag. Plus being super dependable.

Kyle Lowry needs traded
Kyle Lowry has entered the chat..
Neither is Hield. People lamenting the trades we didn't make really have a misunderstanding of just how bad we are right now. One player wouldn't have made a difference. It's more than Westbrook. It's more than losing Caruso. It's everything.  Also Kyle Lowry required us trading half our roster midseason for anyway. Kyle Lowry is a very good player but please show me where he's helping this team?

"&gt; not a lot of meat back there  Steph confirmed a flatbed truck, not a dump truck. That's Kyle Lowry."
"what weighs more, all of Denver's guards or Kyle lowry?"
"no, kyle lowry was traded for a 1st round pick.  the 1st round pick that was essentially the centerpiece of the james harden trade (that became steven adams).  forbes had nothing to do with it.  morey knew he had the decent players and good contracts to make a trade but that he would need a shiny piece of potential for any big trades.  thus he got that pick.  it was part of a years long strategy of treading water while waiting to strike on an available star, and he got his chance with harden.  morey and the raptors both got exactly what they wanted out of that trade.    as for the harden trade, you are undervaluing 22 year olds who, while having a bad finals series, just had a huge WCF and have already proven to be hyper-efficient scorers who can create for others.  that's like gold in the nba.  and you aren't supposed to trade it.  in okc, morey found a team that seemingly had to trade it for financial reasons and pounced before others could.  kevin martin was a good player 2 years before the trade, but, just as this season, the league changed how they called certain fouls that martin was the master at drawing, and his free throw attempts plummeted his last year in houston.  and so did his other numbers.  28 year old kevin martin who's career was forever altered (his PER/WS48 never recovered) is not a big thing to let go of in a trade.  3 mid-1st round picks is not a big deal to get someone with the potential of harden.  it's the classic trading of 4 quarters for a dollar.  you always do that in the nba.  even if he never became an mvp, that 66 TS% harden had his last year in okc was a huge indication that this was a young player who just needed more shot attempts to possibly reach all-star production.  it was a good trade if he just did that.  that he lived up to that and more shows why no team should ever give up a player like that without a king's ransom in return.  because sometimes mid-1st round picks turn into jeremy lamb (didn't become a starter for 6 seasons) and mitch mcgary (out of the league after 2 years)."
The Lakers would've been so much better off if they traded for Kyle Lowry instead of Westbrook
Beal and Harden will most likely pick it up enough to get selected by the time the ASG comes around. If the Heat are good enough and Kyle Lowry picks it up he might get selected and if the Raptors are good enough VanVleet has a real chance. Jaylen Brown might not play enough games but he probably will.   A lot of guards in the east have started slow. Lavine and Trae are the only two guards in the east who haven‚Äôt really started slow. He‚Äôs got a pretty good chance imo.
Steph's gonna come out next season looking like Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry and PJ Tucker have created a charging culture
"OKC got 2 firsts, just drafted rookie Jeremy Lamb (12th overall pick that year), a second round pick, and Kevin Martin.  Essentially, OKC got 3 firsts and Kevin Martin. That‚Äôs not a fleece for a 6th man that wasn‚Äôt expected to be anything more than a quality starter.  A fleece is like the Raptors getting Kyle Lowry for Gary Forbes in a trade with the Rockets. Hmm, wasn‚Äôt Morey the GM that did that trade? Looks like a trade where Morey got fleeced given Forbes never played for Houston."

Kyle Lowry
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Magic got Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams  CP3 for Lou Williams, Beverly and space parts"
he not gonna win a championship. he assure this when pass Kyle Lowry trade.  he overvalues his assets and undervalues the others assets.  not just in normal talks negotiating. he really believes it.
Per Tim McMahon that trade was Harden and Fertitta's idea and Morey's disapproval led to his leaving the team. Other trades include...  Clippers got spare parts for CP3  Thunder got spare parts for Harden  Magic got Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams
In the morning a coffee shop. At night a stripclub... with one stripper... It's Kyle Lowry.
"By your logic Morey deserves no credit for acquiring CP3 and Harden which is idiotic but whatever, how about  Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams"
"Isiah Thomas isn‚Äôt a top 15 pg of all time by ability.  The Bad boys were absurdly stacked, if they had a Chauncey Billups/Kyle Lowry level point guard rather than Thomas they still comfortably win in 89 and 90.  Also the main reason the Pistons didn‚Äôt win in 87 and 88 was Thomas‚Äôs refusal to defer scoring to an infinitely more efficient Dantley."
Kyle Lowry and Demar for the raptors
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
Kyle Lowry should‚Äôve made top 75
"The same Raptor team that went 27-45 last year, then lost their best player in Kyle Lowry?"
I thought Westbrook was a Lebron led move. I don‚Äôt think Westbrook was a good fit for the lakers  Really though the lakers fucked up by not including THT to get Kyle Lowry
"Jalen Brunson is looking like a young Kyle Lowry for us right now. KP the past couple games is looking like an all-star again since he's fully healthy, mobile, and playing well with Luka.  Our role players aren't bad, but we're starting Dwight Powell at C and it's really hurting us most games. We need an upgrade or to do something else there if we can't play KP heavy minutes in that role.  Luka hasn't even been playing that well by his standards of play. But our season to start has also been easy. We're mostly beating worse teams or good teams that are missing players. Hopefully if Luka isn't injured we can prove ourselves in the double matches vs the Suns and Clippers in our next 4 games."

"I think what a lot of people are missing is the refs never wait for the opposing team when you inbound after a score - it's how Kyle Lowry gets so many quick outlets. On the other hand refs always wait for defenses to be ready in deadball situations.  This wasn't an inbounds after a score, but visually it was very similar with the rest of the Lakers and Bulls getting back up the court and Bradley asking for the ball on the baseline to inbound to Lonzo who was by himself in the backcourt.  I imagine the refs lizard brain took over in the similar circumstances which is why he gave up the ball over to Bradley, when he should have held onto it.   It's understandable, but the ref is still at fault and AD had a legitimate gripe."
"https://theathletic.com/2848702/2021/09/27/superstar-shopping-lebron-russell-westbrook-and-the-lakers-summer-of-recruiting  &gt;The group focused first on Lillard and Beal, but with no viable path to trading for either of them, turned their attention to more realistic targets: Westbrook, DeRozan, Hield and Kyle Lowry, who would eventually pursue a deal with the Miami Heat instead. &gt; &gt;There was genuine excitement shared in the player meetings about how DeRozan would fit. Even if he wasn‚Äôt the Lakers‚Äô first choice, it was easy to envision a scenario where he would be their best available option. &gt; &gt;For the Lakers, according to those with knowledge of the situation, it was imperative to keep as many potential avenues open as possible. &gt; &gt;Sources said Pelinka and his front-office group strongly considered executing a sign-and-trade for the 32-year-old DeRozan, giving up Kuzma and Caldwell-Pope in the process, but couldn‚Äôt come to consensus terms with the Spurs in free agency or a suitable contract number for DeRozan. What‚Äôs more, sources say the DeRozan option never advanced to the point that it was presented to Buss.  so they'd have to offer more than that...."
"I mean, when the Heat are fully healthy, they got Bam, Jimmy Butler, Duncan, Kyle Lowry, and Oladipo all splitting Herros shots. My man herro is technically a bench player with how many stars the heat have lol"
"Rockets-  CP3, Harden, Russ, Melo, Kyle Lowry, Dragic, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, Clint Capela, Marcus Morris, Trevor Ariza, Oladipo, Boogie Cousins.  I think that should suffice."
"The fact that the organization went from ""rebuilding team"" to ""oh shit we could possibly get Kyle Lowry"" in under a calendar year is the entire problem being highlighted here"
"There are very few late boomers in NBA. Maybe Kyle Lowry, or Steve Nash. Usually players becomes good during their rookie contract"
Why do people keep bringing up this Lowry trade like it was possible. The Lakers already had Lebron and AD injured during those trade talks. They were not going to trade three more rotation players for Kyle Lowry because thrn they would have missed the playoffs.
"Swap flairs, post 'Kyle Lowry is overrated', see what happens. It's r/nba literally every fanbase is psychotic."
"Slow down the Lowry clip, Kyle lowers his head and George hill walks through. I was curious as to what happened too"
Fuck Kyle Lowry!!
i know i‚Äôm a laker fan but i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs universally accepted around the league who people are referring to when they say THT given that this is the guy we refused to include in a Kyle Lowry trade and chose to resign over caruso‚Ä¶ I would get it if people started callin malik monk MM but THT has basically been referred to as such since he came into the league and started playing consistently
"You should read my full comment before you respond.  &gt; How is missing the postseason maximizing Lebron's prime?  Sorry in no way is phoning home a season good for Lebron. Trading away three rotation players is too much for one guy. Especially in a playoff push while your team is struggling with injuries. Kyle Lowry is not worth KCP, THT and Schroeder. That is a terrible trade."
Wasn't objectively shit. The Lakers miss the playoffs if they trade three rotation players for Kyle Lowry last season. Lowry missed 19 of 27 games after the trade proposal.  How is missing the postseason maximizing Lebron's prime?
It definitely wasn‚Äôt made up out of thin air. It was [well reported](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) that the Lakers didn‚Äôt want to include him in a trade. Like most trade rumours you take it with a grain of salt but to say the fans just made it up isn‚Äôt true.
"THT with 13 in his first game of the season. Kyle Lowry had 5. Lakers made the right move. Checkmate, atheists. Case closed.  /s"
"Kyle Lowry was 35 years old and was about to be an unrestricted free agent and the Raptors wanted KCP, Schroder and THT for him. That was the Lakers' starting backcourt and their best young prospect for a guy who's declining due to his age and who might have left last summer. Toronto was absolutely unrealistic with their asking price for Lowry.   Caruso, meanwhile, is on a contract that will pay him until he's 31 years old and THT can't even legally buy alcohol yet. The Lakers picked the guy who's already the better offensive player between those two (Caruso is obviously better on defense), and the guy with the much higher ceiling. Caruso at 28 is who he is, he's not going to improve, while THT very possibly could make massive strides in the next few years. When Caruso was THT's age he still had two more years left in college before he then went undrafted, having to then wait another year before someone offered him a two-way contract. Age is an important factor when picking between those two."
kyle lowry as your starting PG is basically asking to start a series 0-1  he never shows up for game 1
"yeah we were shitting our pants worried that Giannis wanted to go team up with Pascal Siakam in Canada lmao  If Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard didn‚Äôt want to stay, Giannis sure as Hell wasn‚Äôt going there"
"Gilbert arenas is #1 by far.  Richard Jefferson is really really good already.  I feel like chris paul would be good, kyle lowry, maybe jimmy butler?   Embiid could replace shaq now that I think about it tho lol"
And don't even forget. Kyle Lowry exists. People meme about the charges but this dude is getting run over by the best athletes in the world every night on purpose to help him team get a possession
Kyle Lowry and 4 bench players.
That Kyle Lowry is a spot up shooter.
"The 76ers were asking for Kyle Lowry, Fred Van Vleet, OG Anunoby, and the number four pick from the Raptors this past July. Are you saying Morey is being reasonable here and anything less is pennies on the dollar for Simmons?"
Ur so mad Ben sucks that u put Kyle Lowry on this list LMAOOO    And better than Dame + CP3
Top 3 point guard? LOL get out of here. I can list a couple that are DEFINITELY and NO DOUBT better than Trae:  James Harden Chris Paul Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Kyle Lowry    Now which 4 are you kicking out to put Trae as top 3? LOL
Could be.  Or it could be they're talking about the [2017 offseason when Lowry was a free agent and was free to talk to other teams.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19792645/kyle-lowry-announces-re-signed-toronto-raptors)
Imagine Kyle Lowry not being ur PG
The Heat were first interested in Kyle Lowry in 2014. This is not a secret
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever fucking seen Kyle Lowry or Tyler Herro miss a shot. Ever.
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry
"Idk what ""championship equity"" really means but the Raps definitely needed buy-in from Lowry to make the new pairing succeed which basically means that he had leverage in the situation and therefore some power over it. If he wanted to tank it he could have but Masai trusted that Kyle would understand and be professional about it."
What a dumb argument. Kyle Lowry also has zero all defensive teams.
"In this situation I'm guessing most players understand the clear personnel upgrade being made even if it means their friend being shipped. If Kawhi joined the Bucks and they made the next five finals I think Giannis would be pretty happy with the front office.  On that topic, Toronto traded DeRozan for Kawhi even though Demar and Kyle Lowry were best friends. Kyle might have been mad but he definitely understood it professionally."
"LeBron, Steph, KD, Harden (offered), Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Jrue, amongst however many others just in the past year or two."
"[Lakers were looking at Lowry at last years trade deadline and we‚Äôre in serious talks.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) per reports they were looking at making this trade:  &gt; Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles‚Äô starting backcourt, Dennis Schr√∂der and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker. The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers‚Äô vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers in his second season  This off season Lowry was a free agent and could sign anywhere with cap space or be S&amp;T. If Lowry wanted to go to the Lakers, the Lakers could have put a package together since teams that have the bird rights FA (Toronto) do not have an insane amount of leverage. Toronto got Dragic from the Heat who isn‚Äôt really playing for the Raps right now. Lakers were able to put a package together for Westbrook where they had to off load both Caruso and KCP. If Lakers were reported by Shamas as serious suitors you know they at least had a chat with Lowrys agent and Bobby Webster"
&gt;Imagine Kyle Lowry and Caruso on this Lakers team.  Was Lowry ever a real possibility?  Seems like they would have taken that option in a heartbeat if it was.
"I didn't compare them, I just used DLo as an example of a guard that can score 20ish points at league efficiency and that you need to provie a lot more then that to be a great player. I much rather have Kyle Lowry type player who scores 18 a game while being a great playmaker.  In todays game, having a only scorer who drops 25-30 is not even enough. Look at guys like Lavine or Booker. They are not near MVP conversation. Despite them often scoring above league efficiency, rather then below like IA.  IA would be a good player, like many scoring guards he would be rated around 20-40 range, not 1-5 as some people seem to think."
Imagine Kyle Lowry and Caruso on this Lakers team.
You realize that LeBron is the cause of this ‚Äúdumpster fire‚Äù right? He and AD balked on the Hield for Kuzma trade to target Westbrook because they wanted that third star on their team - despite Westbrook being well‚Ä¶himself.  No doubt LeBron and Klutch are also  heavily influencing management on how valuable THT really is when in reality not packaging him for Kyle Lowry and forcing ownership to penny pinch on Alex Caruso are clearly huge mistakes.  If this season implodes it‚Äôs squarely on LeBron who pulled the strings on most of the trades and FA acquisitions.
He's fat like Kyle Lowry is fat.
"When did Kyle Lowry have more success than AD as the first option? For that matter, why did you put both Lowry and DeRozan? Russ has had more success than AD as the #1 option? And fucking Bradley Beal?? I feel like you have never followed the NBA before lmao"
"I don't have a huge issue with the Raps trading Lowry, but I sure hope it's not for fucking Lou Will and Beverly. Those guys are doing nothing for a team trying to scramble back into the playoffs while at the same time developing a young core. Sure, maybe PBev can still D it up and maybe Lou can still shoot, but those are two things the Raptors really aren't hard up for.  Zubac might be a good pick up, especially if Baynes continues to play like ass, but I honestly think the Clippers will have to offer better pieces if they really want Kyle."
"Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul is ~20 ppg, SGA, Brogdon, Ben Simmons/Lebron if you count them as PG,"
"""Kyle Lowry is not a HOF"""
Westbrook ? nah  Give me KYLE LOWRY.
How can they fit Kyle Lowry in their minds?
Lmao yall really think Beverly and zubac is a good enough package to land Kyle lowry???
this articles ‚Äúsource‚Äù just links to a Bleacher Report article where the author is speculating about kyle lowry trades. idk how this shit gets upvoted.
lol this articles source is a Bleacher Report article that is all speculation on a Kyle Lowry to Clippers trade. C‚Äômon yall.
"Seeing kyle in Boston would absolutely break my heart, that's literally the last place I'd want him to go if he left us.   On the other hand, seeing all the Celtics fans who said nothing but *horrendous, awful* things about Lowry switch up and cheer him on would be funny."
"Sure they just have to factor in the value of Lou Will during the regular season against whoever they trade for. If they can get like Kyle Lowry then great, go for it.   They should still be aiming for the 1st seed. They're not so strong a team that they can just tank through all the hardest matchups. Get the Lakers and Jazz to knock one other out.   Better if they somehow don't have to deal with the Nuggets either who I think they're still weak to. Don't have the kind of defense to guard Jokic and Murray getting hot again will kill them."
"Lmao that is a terrible return for Kyle Lowry, i am pretty sure at least one team out there can offer better value than Zubac. Maybe the Nuggets could be a sneaky candidate?"
Obligatory Kyle Lowry post.
Kyle Lowry
"If Sixers actually get Kyle Lowry, things will get spicy"
Just searched Twitter for this and there‚Äôs a lot of Sixers fans saying they wouldn‚Äôt want to give up SHAKE MILTON for Kyle Lowry............  Those weird lies people told about Lowry never being good in the playoffs really permeated
Need big butt Kyle Lowry expeditiously
Lol can you imagine if we had kyle fucking lowry as our backup point guard
"robinson, nunn, and canadian legend kelly olynyk enough for a year of 34 year old kyle lowry?"
"&gt;Would also cheer for you guys in the playoffs with Kyle (except against us)  I would probably secretly cheer against us if they had Lowry, not gonna lie.  I feel dirty now."
"&gt;The reason I‚Äôd potentially prefer Danny is our lineup makes more sense defensively with him at shooting guard over Seth.  You'd have Kyle Lowry and Simmons in the same backcourt - you wouldnt need a ""starting SG""  Replace Thybulle with Shake in that proposal and have Thybulle start at the 3"
We've been eyeing you guys as a landing spot for Lowry as:  1) you still have all your picks + other non trash assets  2) are Kyle's hometown  3) would contend with Kyle's addition  Would also cheer for you guys in the playoffs with Kyle (except against us).  Let's do it?
Its funny because Philly fans probably spew the most hate against Kyle compared to other teams. I remember during the playoffs ben punched lowry in the nuts and Philly fans were trying to blame Kyle. Its true that Philly hates themselves the most lol
"We‚Äôre on track to a first round exit, let‚Äôs be real. The core of our team other than Lowry is pretty young, there‚Äôs every reason to believe we can build around those guys and have a championship caliber team in a few years if we make the right moves. Kyle has maybe a year or two left of performing at a championship contender starter level, we‚Äôre not going to be able to build around him to still catch him in his prime before he‚Äôs too old. Trading him for stuff that will pan out in the next couple years like young players or draft picks is going to lead to a better outcome than holding onto him and fighting our way to a first round exit this year."
The Weeknd is Kyle Lowry  Drake is Fred Van Vleet  And both Canadians  Coincidence???..yea
The Weeknd looks like Kyle Lowry
If Kyle Lowry was Bruno Mars
"This is the most I‚Äôve ever looked at the weekend‚Äôs face, and I‚Äôve realised he looks like Kyle Lowry"
"The one-two punch of ""The Raid on Stables Castle"" and ""The Isle of Van Gundy"". I may be a bit biased as they are both Clippers-centric episodes, but they are hilarious in their own right. The Van Gundian rant song and the Rockets' antics are just too good.  Anything having to do with the Raptors, especially with Kyle Lowry and the horse.  The episode where MarShon Brooks waxes philosophically about his aborted trade to the Suns, and where Boogie is captured by the Blazers (""Does he know the way out?"" ""Don't worry, he'll be ejected eventually."")  Some episodes even transcended the humor, like Kyrie leaving the Cavs and narrating over scenes of players moving in the offseason, or the whole Demar trade episode.  And the whole final season was well done with a nice coherent storyline."
Kyle Lowry honestly surprised me with his longevity. I don't even think he's 6 feet tall and he plays a very physical and taxing style yet his best years all came while he was north of 30 (he's a way better player now at 34/35 than he was at 25)
That's always between 0 and 1. Nobody out-booties Kyle Lowry
Harrell plus Schroeder for Kyle Lowry ü§î
I am from Philadelphia and Kyle Lowry
Kyle with any other players is a good fit. There's a reason why every stat that looks at on-court impact (rather than just box score manipulation) shows Kyle Lowry as a superstar. There isn't a role he can't fill on a team.
So... U r telling me that Kyle Lowry isn't going around telling everyone that he is getting traded?
So last season we can confirm Kemba Walker and Kyle Lowry were better than Bradley Beal since they were all stars and Beal wasn‚Äôt   Am I right?
"Ibaka does provides rim protection and is a smart defender, we're just so spoiled with Gasol playing the backline. Ibaka couldn't replicate that, plus he still struggles when he has to switch in space. Our scheme made him look worse sometimes I think.    Low key I was more worried about his offense with the Clippers. Kyle Lowry used to feed him so many easy baskets."
Is Kyle Lowry really better than Russell Westbrook lol
Kyle Lowry - one of the best all around point guards in the league and doesn't get talked about at all because he plays for Toronto
Nba champion Kyle Lowry? Lmao
Well it definitely wouldn't be a hall of fame where Kyle Lowry and his 1 3rd team all-nba gets in.
"I mean, ""fine"" is relative. He's the greatest Raptor of all time, but he's old as fuck, costs a fortune, is on the last year of his contract. This Raptor team is a second round exit at BEST this year and you don't even get the home gate for a playoff run because they playing in fucking Tampa.  This seems like the perfect year because you have a lot of teams that would improve DRAMATICALLY from adding Kyle Lowry, I think they would be nuts to keep him."
"Prime LBJ could also guard 90% of the current Cs in the NBA, imo there is no way Simmons is a better defender than he was either.  LBJ just happen to be in his physical prime when it was much more common place for teams to have Roy Hibbert sized 5s lumbering around where as these days most teams don't have a big capable of backing Kyle Lowry into the paint (that booty is strong though to be fair)."
"Because his contract is up this off season and it's unsure whether he has even made up his mind on staying or not. If he decides against it, that means we would have lost him for nothing.  On top of that if we pay him what he wants to get, which is apparently in the 2/60 range, that destroys any flexibility we would have to improve our team the rest of the time he's here, also from a trade perspective people aren't going to want to pay 30 million for a 35/36 year old Kyle Lowry.  The other big factor is if he wants to go, and that's what it will come down to most. The franchise is going to want to do right by him, he holds all the cards here. They're not going to ship him away somewhere he doesn't want or have a say in like they did with DeMar."
whats the most the raptors can get back for Kyle Lowry?&gt;
Kyle Lowry.
"Yeah it's just name value, just like how Kyle Lowry isn't getting credit for playing at an all star level as a 34-35 year old but every time Lebron scores they mention how impressive it is."
Kyle Lowry.  Edit: Not biased
"This. There are some ways you can make a case but it all boils down to the Spurs having invested development time and roster construction around their youth, they are not going to deviate from that for a guy like Lowry. No shade at Kyle but he's on the back half of his prime and doesn't put the Spurs over the top. Its a poor move if they have to give up assets and doesn't address any needs going forward.   The Spurs have a log jam in the backcourt/wing so swapping assets to balance that as part of an LMA/Lowry deal is I guess somewhat plausible but what does Toronto have they'd be willing to move that the Spurs want and didn't already acquire in the Leonard deal?  For Lowry on a personal level, he already has a ring and certainly he'd want another but reuniting with Demar and playing for a solid organization would be attractive."
I can't believe Kyle Lowry has as many as he does.
As if Kyle Lowry would have ever made it past the conference finals without Kawhi.
Why would Kyle Lowry even make a team?
How is Chris Paul ahead of Kyle Lowry?
Is Kyle Lowry coming to the Sixers?
Kyle Lowry is literally a bum. The fact that none wanted to trade for his sorry giant ass shows that. Only people dumb enough to think hes got any value is the raptors fanbase and their delusional GM.
Here's a related article  [https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/03/26/raptors-believed-they-had-kyle-lowry-deal-with-sixers-difference-was-draft/](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/03/26/raptors-believed-they-had-kyle-lowry-deal-with-sixers-difference-was-draft/)
MVP: Kyle Lowry  MIP: Chris Boucher  6MOTY: Chris Boucher  ROTY: Malachi Flynn I guess   DPOY: OG Anunoby
"If we were ""just"" giving up Maxey + Thybulle + Picks (2 firsts even), I'm okay with the trade.  But we need to match salary and the only realistic way to match salary there was to trade Danny Green, a starter, 40% 3 pt shooter and they STILL wanted Maxey + Thybulle. Maxey isn't doing anything for us right now, but I'd pack his bags for any trade, but Thybulle is a significant contributing factor to our 2nd ranked defense. We'd be giving up a ""raw"" prospect in Maxey, an all-NBA level bench defender in Thybulle (who HAS been a 35% shooter in his career, but is not doing well this year) and a starter who is contributing like 4 3s a game and solid wing defense. Kyle Lowry is a big deal, but he's not worth losing two major contributors to our team, 2 low 1sts and a raw prospect who is likely worth a low first right now. That's insane and probably doesn't even improve our team that drastically."
"&gt;Masai respected lowrys wishes to play for a contender or stay w raps and everyone but lowry/masai seems cheesed lol  Yup, this exactly. So many salty Sixers fans acting like they were somehow entitled to our guy, and we somehow wronged them by not taking whatever they were offering.  Raptors Nation was always happy to keep Kyle. He's our GOAT. Go check the Raps sub, or Raps Twitter: the overwhelmingly majority are psyched and relieved that Lowry is staying.  Masai wasn't looking to do a favour for a division rival. He set a price, and no one met it, so Lowry stayed, end of story. No reason for Morey or anyone else to be salty about it."
"No player has improved their reputation more with a championship than Kyle Lowry. The guy has never been good in the big moments outside his first quarter in Game 6 of the Finals. Outside that, he rode Kawhi + FVV to the championship. Kyle Lowry has never been worth that contract he got."
"Lowry will re-sign, OR they will do a sign and trade, that's probably about equal to the offers Masai was getting from Philly and Miami... The raptors lost nothing by keeping him, and kept 2 fellow Eastern conference teams  a lil less competitive... this isn't Vince or Bosh. This is Kyle Fucking Lowry. He's going to have the first retired number and statue in T.O."
"The raps gave up JV n the gasol trade. Gasols gas tank was at 1/4 and the gas light was about to come on. But it was a difference maker. When you are serious about winning now (which the sixers should be) you have to make the short sighted move knowing full well in 2 or 3 years the other team will still be reaping the rewards. Kyle Lowry is a difference maker, his price should be in LA LA land for a team that needs one more push to get over the hurdle. Banners are forever. Young players that arent generational talents come and go for the right pieces"
kyle lowry and marcus smart have pretty much lapped the field the last 5 or 6 years.  those dudes would have flown into the first row if they were selling that call.
Word is Kyle Lowry saw the comment and told our guys that Reddit was talking shit.
"Yeah, I'd say Spicy P is #3. In my house at least, #4 is certainly ""Kyle 'Fucking' Lowry""."
Toronto raptors are doing better even without Kyle Lowry. Underrated
CHRIS BOUCHER! Didn't even need Kyle Lowry to beat a healthy Sixers. Just 18 to 35 free throws attempts too.  Sixers need like Lowry more than the Raps. Is that rumor still alive?
We will take one Kyle Lowry from Toronto and you're gonna like it.
Kyle Lowry teaching his lil bro how to yeet
Its Kyle fucking Lowry. He built different
Kemba is like Kyle Lowry if Kyle Lowry was a bad player
1. Steph Curry  2. Luka Doncic  3. Damian Lillard  4. Chris Paul  5. Kyrie Irving  6. Ben Simmons  7. Kyle Lowry  8. Trae Young  9. De'Aaron Fox  10. Russell Westbrook
"Chris Paul, the Kyle Lowry of the west. Good for him."
"I know sports trends are typically cyclical and the play style may change that leads to someone breaking the record, but with the way the league is going I feel Stockton's career assist total is going to hold up at least for the rest of my lifetime.  Stockton's longevity, passing, and the era he played in basically create a perfect storm for a near untouchable record.  In regards to era:  - League pace is still below what it was during the 80's - ORtg on average is only a few points higher than the 80's - Assists per 100 possessions is still less than what it was in the 80's - Teams now run at least two ball handlers so even though total assists have been going up, individual assist numbers are going down  In regard to the last point: 10th highest APG in 89-90 (Terry Porter, 9.07) would've finished 2nd highest in 18-19 (ahead of Kyle Lowry, 8.68).  We may see someone average 13 APG again, but I highly doubt we ever see someone average that for 10 seasons while missing only 4 games. And on top of that 10 year stretch, which by itself would be 2nd all time time in assists (behind only Kidd), he also tacked on another 9 years at 8 APG.  I know career rebounds/blocks looks more unsurmountable, but I could at least see rule changes causing an increase for individual production in those stats. I don't ever see the league going back to a single primary ball handler running the entire offense again."
"There's barely any difference between all of them, the reason LaVine doesn't have team success is because he's not playing with a point guard that knows how to run an offense (CP3, Conley). Bulls should try getting Kyle Lowry, he could have a CP3-esque effect on their team.   All of them are overrated in the sense that they are shooting guards, and shooting guards without a point guard that can run the offense aren't going to lead to efficient team offense and wins."
The truth  The answer The claw Kyle bulldog Lowry  Westbrick  Its good because they all earn it
I love Kyle Lowry and feel the same way about this.
"Casey's plays leaked: - Demar midrange iso  - Lowry deep 3 - ???  - JV 3 (???)  Not to mention his biggest blunder in Game 7 of that series against the KG + Paul Pierce Brooklyn Nets where Dwane Casey fudged up the plan by drawing up a mirrored version of the play. Forced Lowry into a weak left hand side dribble to the paint all while getting doubled by Deron Williams and Garnett. Kyle tries to lay it up, gets blocked by Pierce, and the rest is history."
"Melo- 6x all NBA, Probably shouldn‚Äôt be on the list in retrospect, but I‚Äôm not going to change it now.  Dantley-3 seasons of 30 ppg and a known leader of men who helped mentor the Bad Boy pistons into the team they ended up becoming.   King- 4x all NBA One of the greatest scorers in NBA history and was able to bounce back from injury again and again.   Championships are a team thing and with few exceptions, I don‚Äôt give individual players a ton of credit for team accomplishments. Kawhi has only ever played on amazing teams. San Antonio, the Raptors, and the Clippers (to a lesser extent). His run with the Raptors was incredible, but he was hardly the only good player on his team. If Marc Gasol doesn‚Äôt play as well as he did against Embiid, the Raptors lose that series with the 76ers. If he doesn‚Äôt have the dogged determination of Kyle Lowry, they probably don‚Äôt beat anyone. In San Antonio, he had 2-3 hall of fame players on his team and a top 10 coach of all time. He has Paul George and a solid bench with the Clippers. We‚Äôll see what happens there.   If he continues to play amazingly, he‚Äôll be on my list. If he fades with age, he might still get on my list."
"Feel like he needs to play that Kyle Lowry role next to a guy of Kawhi's caliber like what happened in Toronto. Conley can definitely give it his all for one playoff run and be a true 2nd option to a championship team.   Actually, clippers could use a PG like him if things don't work out for the Jazz or Clippers this year."
Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry are the real Embiid stoppers. They flop every time they are switched on him and get the call 1/4 times. Which is damn good when you can give Joel a foul once every four times.
Kyle Lowry is officially at 85% on there.  Two more full seasons and he's basically a lock.
"Idk man, Kyle Lowry would like a word"
Kyle Lowry with Victoria‚Äôs Secret
I was blessed enough to witness the Kyle Lowry yeet against the Wizards in person.
Kyle Lowry not playing is a curse for other teams. 15 straight games that is SO weird
"Your right that I should have included Jokic (offensively). Even harden I agree is an all time great playmaker. But it‚Äôs slightly different than the way Lebron and CP3 do it. Harden leverages his gravity to create imbalance in a defense, and then either scores or assists. I feel like the difference is Lebron and CP3 get people in the right spots, and then pass the ball knowing that the pass leverages the defense (whether they get the assist or not). But Paul (especially) is fine throwing the ball to the post, or a to a wing on mis-match, and then directs traffic off ball in a way harden doesn‚Äôt.  Jokic has a similar organizing effect on offense but obviously defensively is not the same. Honestly, the closest I‚Äôve seen as an ‚Äúorganizer‚Äù on both sides of the ball is probably Kyle Lowry, even if he isn‚Äôt as good at exploiting gravity as other superstars if that makes sense."
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Kyle Lowry is very good. He will still be very good next season and maybe another after that. It will not be cheap to get him, even if you have to match the salary. I wouldn't want anything less than a young guy and unprotected pick."
the raptors should trade kyle lowry to the sixers like asap. flynn needs to play.
It‚Äôs no Kyle Lowry yeet but it‚Äôs a yeet for sure
"Well unless the Sixers manage to conjure up a competent half court ball handler/off the dribble scorer like Kyle Lowry, they‚Äôre out of real contention. A team with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer is going nowhere."
"Oh no worries my man, no worries. We'll just take one of those guards off your hands... say a Kyle Lowry or FVV? We'll figure it out, bud. ;)"
"Yeah we get it he's sick at defense but eventually he either needs to expand his scoring. As frustrated as I was with Siakam atleast he could hit a jumpshot outside the paint. He was still averaging more points than Simmons career-high and he was getting trashed. I don't mind players whose worst skill is their scoring, Kyle Lowry is one of them, but you still need to be a threat and he's way too limited. It's his 5th season...    Ben Simmons is a great 2-way player, I don't want to shit on him too much. But I feel like people are trying too hard to justify his game when it's obvious how critical his flaws are. If he wants to be a championship winning player he needs to expand his range. Or move a full time PF I guess, but even then, if he wants to handle the ball as much as he does, he needs to be a threat outside the paint. Not to mention if he wants to fit next to Embiid, the face of the franchise, he needs to expand his game. Great defense and playmaking can only take you so far. If he's satisfied with this ceiling, the Sixers will be forced to pair up Embiid with another perimeter scoring option eventually."
"Yeah he has an extremely established floor because every game he will get a certain number of points through transition or how he can just get to the rim in like 2 long strides against a sleeping defense in half court.   His lack of aggression is a big part of why he doesnt score more. But he also just isnt gonna have many super high scoring games because there's no heat check with him, cant rely on hot shooting variance as much. His first 2 seasons he scored 30 pts in one reg season game total. I wouldnt be surprised if he never scores 42 like he did Monday the rest of his career. Guys like Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry their career highs are only 43."
Giannis or Kyle Lowry for me
"That‚Äôs super interesting! It‚Äôs different to football (soccer) most players have their best years at 29 and very rarely do they start so well so quickly - with obvious exceptions!  Ps. Kyle Lowry is the goat... I know I said Steph just below MJ/Lebron, well they‚Äôre both below my number 7;)"
You‚Äôre fine haha. I mean Steph Curry finally broke out when he was 26/27. Lou Williams didn‚Äôt have his best season until 31. I‚Äôd say Kyle Lowry might fit your description the most.  Overall I feel like star players get to a high level usually around 24/25 and consistently build on that.
Lowry definitely rely on athleticism too. And Steph‚Äôs career really took off when he was 24-25 years old. Kinda similar to Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt have the same play style of Steph Curry. You claimed his game is ageless and differed
"I mean, he will only be 34 years old. Kyle Lowry is 34 years old and his game hasn‚Äôt aged anything."
Kyle Lowry
"Kyle Lowry has a decent post game he‚Äôll use when he‚Äôs guarded by a similar size guard. Maybe it‚Äôs less effective for a guy like JJ Barea, but for a stronger guard or a really smooth guard like CP3 or Kyrie it‚Äôs a viable option."
&gt;Your own boy Kyle Lowry has a history of dangerous plays against Aaron Gordon  okay shaq lmfao
"I mean I can pull out some clips of almost every player in the league getting a flagrant 2. Your own boy Kyle Lowry has a history of dangerous plays against Aaron Gordon, doesn‚Äôt mean I think he‚Äôs dirty. But whatever helps you sleep at night."
"+160 to +200 raps probably  Raps were +180 two days ago, I got in at +285 for this game (no Kyle Lowry), just before the game it was +235"
i might be the biggest kyle lowry fan that exists outside of toronto but much of his production can be made up by their other players. the bucks bench can't make up for not having the best wing defender in the league who also was having his best shooting season ever.
The Kyle Lowry special
Even worse is the subsequent passing on a Kyle Lowry trade because Dolan didn‚Äôt want to get burned by Masai again
"Hey, maybe you can trade away part of your future again for a rental of player and have the opposing finals team have two of their star players rupture their achilles again. Or you just going to overpay for kyle lowry some more? Oh, you went with the second option for some reason. Well have fun losing in the second round for the next decade"
"I see some Kyle Lowry in Cole Anthony. Great defensive pg for his size, got a ton of fight in him."
PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julias Randle  C: Joel Embiid
"&gt;Gobert elevates his team to no less than 50 wins. Beal elevates his team to, what, 30 in a much weaker conference?  This line of thinking is hella weird. The Utah Jazz have always had a stacked team. They've always been extremely balanced and well built. There is no proof the he elevates the team to their record. He's the best player on the team, but there is a close second, and then an extremely solid 3rd and 4th option. I'm not going to attribute Utah's success to just Rudy. They're like the Raptors of the West. Kyle Lowry is the best player, but Siakam is one hell of a second option with a plethora of role players and a solid coach/GM. Beal plays for the Wizards man. Look at hoe good they were when they put good players around Wall/Beal."
Larry Nance  Zion  Joe Ingles   Gary Harris  Kyle Lowry   This also might be bordering on cheating too much with too many good players but off the top of my head what I came up with. Playmaking from multiple spots in general is something I think would help any Zion offense

Make a run at Kyle Lowry
Man I used to mix up Carl Landry and Kyle Lowry during their Rockets day when I was little
"Bev plays hard on both ends, trading him would be a mistake.  But i dunno if you got Kyle Lowry somehow thatd be an improvement."
"Lowry would be perfect here  Philly kid, playoff ready, can defend and shoot 3 and run the half court  Ben/Kyle PnR would be sweet, and with Tobi or seth slashing or spreading and Ben's vision, you could have a quick second pass for a good look  And of course Joel/Kyle PnRs  please /u/dmorey"
"I misread ""Kyle Landry"" as ""Kyle Lowry"" and thought I either missed some news or fell through a crack in time or something."
"sorry, but that's a dumb statement. rebounding and finishing are his greatest strengths, and you think he should aim to average the same number of rebounds as kyle lowry?"
"Meh. NBA Media is trash because they're lazy and vote for familiar names. And as much as that hurts a guy like Anunoby for All-Defense considerations, it also helps a guy like Kyle Lowry every time the All-Star game comes around."
"Making fun of his analogy aside, he's got a point. Does three inches make that much of a difference when a player is stronger? Kyle Lowry is 6 ft and bullies through everybody"
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
Harden spear headed a Kyrie and KD less BRK team in a comeback W against the Suns  Bucks lose 4th straight in a game where Kyle Lowry got injured   Heat get shell shocked by the Clippers bench unit   Dame does Dame type things to OKC  AD will be out for about a month  Jokic needs some help other than Murray
Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no
KYLE LOWRY he has the softest buttü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µ
Tbh Kyrie is still a locker room cancer and I‚Äôd much rather Kyle Lowry of CP3
"Kyle Lowry too, but that seems way less likely"
This is like the Kyle Lowry signature move.    He did this about 100 times in the playoffs against the Celtics last season.
They would. Kyle Lowry and Steven Adams are both considered overweight.
"Listen, it's one thing to do that in Detroit and Cleveland. It's another to elbow KYLE FUCKING LOWRY for a rebound, I bet that shit gets checked quick. FVV was gracious about Kawhi but even in his undertones you can tell parts of it still annoyed him, I highly doubt he'd tolerate any shit from Andrew Drummond LOL.    I'm saying is we have the locker room to hold him accountable in a way that he's probably never been held accountable before. These guys have cache around the league now so they're respected voices.    I still don't want him, but I do admit he's better than Baynes. Atleast Drummond grabs rebound and dunks."
It's really not the same though.  I remember the good old days when every thread there was a comment about doing nasty things to Kyle Lowry.  Not really the same anymore.
"Nothing wild is happening, he‚Äôs just too old and washed. The fact that he looks like pure shit despite playing with Kyle Lowry is proof enough that he‚Äôs got nothing left in the tank.   Lowry has completely revived the careers of multiple big men, and got some of them paid big bucks (just look at Biyombo getting a $70 million contract after his lone season in Toronto). If Baynes looks this bad with him, he‚Äôll look even worse anywhere else."
"My guy you apparently want Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Mike Scott and picks for Kyle Lowry on an expiring with the hope that he will take a discount to resign.   You can take that nonsense elsewhere."
How in the gods name can you get Kyle Lowry without becoming the Brooklyn Nets situation
"&gt;Usually I'd say yes, but I think you'd want to give as much time as possible for Kyle to adjust to the team.   why would the raps care about that? ifv we trade Lowry we'd just want demand as high as possible so we get the most"
"Kyle doesn‚Äôt make any sense, if the raps are trading for Drummond it‚Äôs because they think he makes them better. If the raps trade Lowry out it means they are trying to be worse."
Kyle lowry would take a charge from God himself and live to tell the tale
Wouldn‚Äôt Kyle Lowry do it?
This ain‚Äôt it Kyle Lowry is 35 and would be a free agent while both Schroder and THT are much younger. It‚Äôs just bad asset management to do a trade like that have to think beyond just this year AD Is 27 and he is the future.

Raptors (1-6) and Rockets (2-4)  Kyle Lowry / John Wall  James harden / FVV   OG / Eric Gordon   Siakam / Tucker   Christian Wood / Boucher
Kyle lowry out rebounded all our centres combined yesterday
"thats what ppl did to kyle lowry. lowry proved em wrong, if paul is good, hell do the same."
"media did the same thing to kyle lowry till lowry proved himself and now the narrative changed. if PG is like that, hell get similar results as lowry."
"I really think you guys lost something with Crowder going to Phoenix. I think he did so much that only diehard NBA fans noticed.   Speaking about you saying you guys need a consistent PG, I wonder if Riley will call up Toronto to inquire about Kyle Lowry. He would fit that culture like a glove imo"
Kyle lowry on big macs though? Nothing to complain about there.
You think raptors are gonna basically donate kyle lowry to the clippers after all the tampering they did in 2019? I would honestly ship lowry to the lakers for cash considerations than to trade him to the clippers.
"nope, but i love the dynamic nature of nba games now, but i just really hate when a shot fake gets the defender in the air and he's just fucked by then, FTs coming up. plus the way that refs reward the kyle lowry drive to the basket and jump backwards into the defender and throw the ball. FTs coming up lmao   i didn't consider the incentive to foul harder tho, that's a good point in the comments"
One Kyle Lowry to the Clips please. No idea how we could get him but he‚Äôd be perfect.
Doubt we'd get back an amazing deal for Lowry cause he's in his last year of contract and 35 years old. If Masai asked Kyle for his preferred trade destination it would definitely be his home town Philly. Teams like Clippers and Lakers have 0 assets for him compared to Philly
The roster? I mean TD is probably on the outs anyway. Kyle Lowry loves Toronto but I don't know that he'd wanna keep losing. At least the Magic will probably make it to the playoffs he goes there.
Kyle Lowry always in the race for most technicals
Kyle Lowry ain't no ring chaser. He's an NBA champion. YOU should switch to a contending team. We want Lowry
[nah he wraps a towel around his head kinda like a turban](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.raptorshq.com%2F2019%2F3%2F12%2F18261767%2Fwatch-the-tape-toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry&amp;psig=AOvVaw3LQxeR1tk5f8LAZ_8y1o1X&amp;ust=1610075283899000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCPDZ9P7riO4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
Damn Kyle Lowry bustin ass out here
Ask Nick Nurse and Kyle Lowry if its an actual tactic lol.
Yeah I was just playing around.   There is no conceivable world where we trade Kyle Lowry for Marcus Smart though
Kyle Lowry is gone by the trade deadline
Every final from 2011 to 2020 also had LeBron or Kyle Lowry.
"Its cause you did. Lost kwahi. Then next season lost ibaka and gasol. You got an aging kyle lowry. Your defense, bench and spacing all got worse."
Yeah...Demar and Lowry on a personal level brought a lot of joy to Raptor fans. They formed a special friendship and grew as players and into all-stars before our eyes. Lebron for sure was a major factor and I think it fair to say that Deebo and Kyle got the brunt of the fanbase‚Äôs frustrations. We know that there would be no championship without DD and KLow. They both have given their heart and soul to the Raptors organization and should always will be treasured here.
James harden and Kyle Lowry are sweating somewhere
"No the issue is our defence isn't soul crushing as it used to be. We never were strong offensively, but our defense made sure to keep other teams down. Then we've lost 3/5 of our 2019 starting lineup and 4/7 of our 2019 core, and we replaced them with nothing because ""Giannis"".  We got no center, we got no depth. Go watch the 2019 playoffs, watch how between games different players would pop off and make up for other players going cold, and how the defense made sure the other team couldn't pop off either.  We still have the inconsistency in offense, but no defense or depth to cover it. Even last game with Kyle, FVV, and Siakam (yes siakam played well yesterday) doing well we still lose.  We should be 0-6 but it took a historically bad shooting game from the knicks for us to get our only win.  Siakam is in his head but he can improve, OG is hit or miss, FVV is doing good but he's not a PG and an undersize SG, Norm is playing bad, our young core isn't getting any minutes and getting railed on by nurse for playing bad defence (no shit we got no centers)... Byne's twitter account is more valuable than him. Lowry is the only person consistent and doing well, if we lose him it's over.  And to top is off we gotta spend 72 away games with fucking Tampa fans... Fuck Tampa"
Next to [Kyle Lowry legendary dribble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdIK9Am1Qo0)
"Nah, JA should keep that Kyle Lowry bullshit out of Brooklyn"
Why would we trade for him? He's UFA next season anyway.  Be real bro. Kyle Lowry is not going to tip us any further into contention suddenly.
"Thicc Kyle Lowry chimed in on the Raptors issues as well  ‚ÄúRight now we have no swag to us ... teams are looking at us and saying let‚Äôs eat ... that‚Äôs not a good position at all‚Äô"""
Which has everything to do with a weak generation of centers in DeAndre's prime and a crowded point guard field when Kyle Lowry emerged as a late bloomer.
K but DeAndre Jordan has more allnba selections than Kyle Lowry...
"Bucks depth? Last year for sure, but a lot has changed. Are their first 3 off the bench in the playoffs going to be Augustin, Forbes, and Portis? Nets look good on paper in that regard, but they really need another PG to run their second unit.   Miami and Indiana look like the deepest teams in the East to me. I agree that Morey will need to make a move for another ball handler by the deadline Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose, Patty Mills, George Hill, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon come to mind as potential fits if they become available."
you don't pay 40-50 for a 35 kyle lowry lol. a 2 year 36m or 3 year 45m contract would be more than enough for lowry
Kyle Lowry fans will disagree you
"Ben Simmons - 13.3, 9.9, 7.0...Non existant outside shot  Kyle Lowry - 18.7, 4.5, 7.7... Barely cracking 40% from the field, team is an abysmal 1-5.  Trae Young - 28.6, 4.1, 9.1...Averaging 3 FTA'S more per game this season and still isn't averaging his most PPG. shooting 33% from 3, and flops his way to the free throw line  Malcom Brogdon - 22.0, 4.4, 7.7... Leads Indiana in PPG. Team is top 3 in FG% thanks to his 47% FG, has increased his PPG from last year by nearly 6.0ppg, was the biggest reason the Pacers went 45-28 last season without Oladipo.   Better scorer than Simmons and Lowry.   Averages the same amount of rebounds as Young and Lowry  Averages the same amount of assists as Simmons and Lowry.   Has a better record than every other player. Quite arguable. If you're not a moron."
Shit if George Hill gets a first round pick back then Kyle Lowry better get back 3 picks

And since I'm not one to miss a chance to remind people how bad it was, a recap:  To Nets  * Vince Carter, averaged 23.6/5.6/4.7 in 374 games with the Nets, making three All-Star teams   To Raptors  * Alonzo Mourning, immediately released over health concerns * Eric Williams, averaged 4/2/1 in 62 games, then traded alongside Matt Bonner, a second and cash for Rasho Nesterovic * Aaron Williams, averaged 1.6/1.2/0.1 in 37 games, then traded for a pair of seconds (neither man ever played in the NBA) * Nets' 2005 first, used on Joey Graham, averaged 6.4/3.1/0.6 in 275 games, then left in free agency * Nuggets' 2006 first, traded alongside Jalen Rose for Antonio Davis, who played 8 games before suffering a season- and ultimately career-ending knee injury (pick used for Renaldo Balkman)  And you know what else is annoying is that the Nets pick could've been David Lee and the Nuggets pick could've been Rajon Rondo or Kyle Lowry (who I keep forgetting didn't actually start his career with the Raptors)."
Hope Kyle Lowry isn't weirded out by this sub's obsession with his ass.
"Then trading a 34 year old expiring point guard when your team is ass is also not a difficult decision.   Lowry has always been strictly business. In 2017 he openly said he wanted to play for the Spurs [but they didn't want him.](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-kyle-lowry-says-interest-joining-spurs-real/)  In the end Masai is going to do what he's always done, which is what's best for the team."
"First off it‚Äôs completely hypothetical, secondly it‚Äôs not like Dallas would give y‚Äôall anything good for a 34 year old Kyle Lowry, hardaway has the closest salary and I doubt he‚Äôs untouchable so he‚Äôd def be in an offer for Lowry"
Kyle Lowry last game as a raptor really is about to be in trash ass florida
Celtics fan saying Kyle Lowry should play for the Clippers.  Holy forking shirtballs this is the bad place
kyle lowry plz
From what I've seen so far this season  The only players worth keeping is Fred Van Vleet and Kyle Lowry
Man I know it‚Äôs a well known meme at this point but Kyle Lowry is thick as shit. It‚Äôs ridiculous
Rockets/Grizzlies legend Kyle Lowry?
Kyle Lowry!!
"BPA, Kyle Lowry is a FA and we don't know if he's returning, and Suggs is the real deal"
&gt; kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
I don't have the pasta on hand so someone gotta help me  Kyle Lowry ain't no spot up shooter
If Kyle Lowry ever has to take a week off the Raptors are so fucked lol
It is kind of funny that the two thiccest superstars ended up on Texas teams. If only Kyle Lowry was on San Antonio we'd have the holy trinity of Texas thicc.
"Per Bleacher report the tenth best small forward might be Bogdan, Ingles or Will Barton.  9-11 best point guards are CP3, Donovan Mitchell and Kyle Lowry.  Given the relative scarcity of wings and our overreaction to a couple of sub-par playoff performances PG is among the more underrated players around."
"OK, first thing you're gonna want to do is binge watch [this entire series](https://gameofzones.bleacherreport.com/). Many of the league's best modern moments have been commemorated in this highly factual animated docu-series.  Next, buy [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Basketball-NBA-According-Sports/dp/0345520106), written by our most valued sports journalist, to learn more about the history surrounding the great game.  You'll want to follow these two ([1](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania) &amp; [2](https://twitter.com/WojESPN)) on twitter for the latest/greatest league-related news.   Start calling everyone nephew. I don't give a shit if it's your fucking grandma, she's a ""cappin nephew"" now, OK?  When a player has a good game, we love him. When he under-performs, he's a piece of shit. Except for Russell Westbrook, we hate Russ on Mondays, Thursday, and Sundays and love him on Tues, Wed, Fri. You don't have to know who that is, just stick to the schedule and post shit like ""Brodie sucks""/""Inefficient chucker"" or ""Brodie rules""/""He's a leader"" on those days.  Oh, and I almost forgot, we're all lowkey gay for these players, so be sure to comment on the thickness or cuteness of certain NBA player features every now and then. I suggest Kyle Lowry and Kelly Oubre (be sure to mention that he's shooting &lt;10% from 3), respectively and you should be good.  I think that's everything you need to succeed here. Goodluck"
"He‚Äôs a bit of an anomaly. At least Toronto he staggered minutes with Kyle Lowry a lot, who is a much better player on both ends. So that probably explains the on-off in Toronto"
Guard - Kyle Lowry  Guard - Tracy McGrady Wing - Vince Carter  Wing - Kawhi Leonard  Center - Marc Gasol  That‚Äôs my uneducated guess.
Trade Lowry for the best price and then try and draft best player available.  Kyle is not going to re-sign to spend his twilight years watching Beyblade turn the ball over so its best to just try and get a pick or something back for him.  Not suggesting we tank but bottoming out for a year and then figuring things out with some cap space next year is not a bad move at all. As constructed this team is a first round exit in the best case.
I‚Äôd still put Kyle Lowry over at least two of those guys
"Huh never would've known seeing as the NBAtv broadcast muted all basketball sounds. No whistles, no dribbling noises, just commentary from a guy that sounded like basketball Booger who couldnt stop repeating himself.   ""Did you know Kyle Lowry isnt a dirty player. I mean by no stretch of the imagination is he a dirty player. Its inconceivable to think hes a dity player because by no means is he a dirty player"".   This was real commentary from that game..."
This isn‚Äôt a bad deal because the Raptors could begin collecting assets if Kyle Lowry leaves this offseason (perhaps Thunder could attach a first).
"Late to the thread but yes please. It drove me nuts for YEARS. Some times I can garner who the player is by the context and flair, but a lot of times, no.   ""EG looks slow."" Who the fuck is EG? Oh, Eric fucking Gordon. Hey, KL is looking thicc. WHO?? Kevin Love? No! It's Kyle lowry! Even though I'm a big raps fan, we've never called him that, just some non-raptor fan trying to be trendy.   Thank you for bringing this up. So tired of this shit. If you ain't a superstar or have a complicated name, nobody beside your own team's diehards would recognize it."

"Kyle Lowry is an exception to the rule, and Harden has been in his prime for some time.  A guy that is 26 is unlikely yo get much better."
"KL . . . man, that thread earlier about these initialisms being too prevalent has a major point. My brain had to cycle through Kyle Lowry and Kevin Love before I realized you meant Kawhi."
"He's another one of those stocky-short dudes who have way more strength than they look. Similar body type to guys like CP3 and Harden, with a sturdy base and thick ass legs. It allows them to be positive post defenders at their position, but more importantly they can box out better(if they choose to). Kyle Lowry too, he's got a similar body type. Hart's an elite rebounder for his position. He plays winning basketball, even if it's not always pretty."
Give Pascal's contract to boucher.  And Kyle Lowry is either brave or stupid to be taking charges from Zion
Kyle Lowry either brave or stupid to be trying to take charges on Zion
One of reasons he was traded from Houston.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1012935-kyle-lowry-charged-with-misdemeanor-battery-on-female-referee.amp.html
ref acting like kyle lowry killed his family smh
Lol can‚Äôt imagine making a statement like that when Kyle Lowry is on your team.
Kyle Lowry stays fucking me whenever I bet on him or against. Fucking bum ass flopper.
Here for my annual fuck Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Kyle Lowry is the greatest raptor of all time.    Other than that, no"
Wonder if his career earnings are the same at this point in his career if he didn‚Äôt get that tutelage from a Kyle Lowry through his first few years.
Best TS% off drives so far (min 15 TSA):  Dame Lillard - 72.3  De'Aaron Fox - 72.2  Luka Doncic - 69.3  Bradley Beal - 69.3  Kyle Lowry - 67.6  Kawhi Leonard - 67.2  Worst:  Ben Simmons - 32.2  Marcus Smart - 34.4  Russell Westbrook - 35.1  LaMelo Ball - 38.3  Donovan Mitchell - 40.0
A lot of bad rookie pg‚Äôs have turned out to be good in the long run. Look at Kyle Lowry or Chauncey Billups. Steve Nash barely played his first year or two in the league and he turned out to be a multi time mvp
Raptors (so that they give up and trade me Kyle Lowry (:
"Yeah everyone always talks about how 'who can beat a lineup of Curry, Harden, LeBron, KD, AD, Draymond, Klay, Dame, etc etc etc etc. But since when do all those players actually choose to opt in?   The last us Olympic team was Kyrie/Lowry, Klay/Jimmy/DeMar, KD/PG/Melo, Harrison Barnes/Draymond, Boogie/DAJ. Which obviously still won gold and most years would also still win gold, but I wouldn't exactly call currently Melo, Harrison Barnes, DeAndre Jordan or Kyle and DeMar the top of the top talent. Great players, especially at the time, but not exactly the best of the best.   It gets even worse when you look at the last world cup roster  Kemba/Smart/Derrick White  Mitchell/Joe Harris  Middleton/Jaylen  Tatum/Barnes  BroLo/Turner/Plumlee  I know American players tend to care more about the Olympics than the world cup, but like................"
Has there ever been a kyle lowry thread that didnt mention his dump truck?
That Kyle lowry thumbnail lollol
"Yup agreed. A good point guard can carry a team for years, look at Raps. Kyle Lowry is literally carrying our trash team.  Kyle lowry is the reason the raps won the chip, kawhi + raps team + random average PG, do not win. Lowry is the heart and soul of the team. Kawhi obviously is the superstar that took us over the hump, but Lowry is like the wife behind the scenes supporting her man dominate the world.   But yeah  cp3 is damn special, he carries that same spark"
"person, I posted highlights for him not too long ago and they got taken down meanwhile I saw Kyle Lowry going between the guys legs like nine times. lol"
"I don't think he's a potential liability because of effort or a lack of talent, it's simply a thing about his physical limitations. Last playoffs the Heat mercilessly hunted Kemba and the Celtics may have the greatest collection of defensive wings, but they still struggled to hide him on defence (and Kemba isn't a bad defender, he's just really small).  Now if Trae was bigger like a Kyle Lowry I wouldn't worry as much, but he's also really skinny and physically outmatched."
The Kyle Lowry era Raptors won much more than the Vince.Carter ones. Even if you take away the championship season (and why would you?)
Kyle Lowry getting big men PAID
"Not really. The Raptors are tied for the second newest franchise.  Also, Lowry has a long track record of elevating his team in ways that don't show up on the box score. A lot of players have had career years alongside Kyle Lowry."
"There are a few Raptors who are extremely fortunate that Kawhi hit that shot. Chief among them is Kyle Lowry, who hadn't had a good playoffs up to that point. He got to redeem himself in the last two rounds of the playoffs.  If the Raptors lose I think they blow it up, and Lowry's legacy is drastically different."
Stupid ass league will fine players for these little things but wont bat an eye when kyle lowry flops for the millionth time and if they do fine them they fine them a minimal amount. No wonder so much ppl stopped watching the nba
"Correction, Kyrie Irving does not lose to Kyle Lowry with the second greatest player of all time next to him. And it's been quite some time since 2016 for Kawhi"
Kyle Lowry got traded to the Knicks in 2012-2013 but Dolan vetoed the trade. He then went on to be the greatest Raptor of all time. It's possible to past it.
Kyle Lowry took a while to show up as a legit player
Idk what Kyle Lowry can do to become better than Kyle Lowry
"Alright I'll bite.  [Since 2013-14, 538 RAPTOR has 5 lowry seasons in the top 50 most impactful point guard seasons. Rondo has none and his earliest entry is over at over 200](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  [BBall-Index's LEBRON on-off metric has 2 lowry seasons in the top 100 since 2009. Rondo has none.](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/)  When comparing their primes according to basketball reference Lowry blows out Rondo in nearly every advanced category, and this is while Kyle spent 5/7 years with Derozan while Rondo ran with the big three celtics every year  And finally, by just comparing title runs we see that Rondo posts worse advanced stats in nearly all categories during his 2020 ring, and in 2008 he's painted a much less impactful offensive player and only a marginally better defender (he was 10 years younger than Kyle, I'd hope so!)  https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=lowryky01&amp;p1yrfrom=2019&amp;player_id2=rondora01&amp;p2yrfrom=2008&amp;player_id3=rondora01&amp;p3yrfrom=2020  https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=lowryky01&amp;p1yrfrom=2019&amp;player_id2=rondora01&amp;p2yrfrom=2020&amp;p3yrto=&amp;p4yrfrom=&amp;p4yrto=&amp;p5yrfrom=&amp;p5yrto=&amp;p6yrfrom=&amp;p6yrto=  So there you have it. Overall it was a fun deep dive. What I found is that Rondo has a shorter prime and was a better defender at the peak of his powers, but defensive gap isn't wide enough to offset just how good Lowry has been at running offensives during his Raptors stint."
Kyle Lowry?
I compared him to Kyle Lowry coming out
"What was Kyle Lowry up to in his 3rd year? Averaging 8 points for a 58-loss MEM team. Obviously he'll never become a winner.  Heck, Jordan was under .500 in his 3rd year."
Kyle Lowry should be tier 7
"Yea, I don‚Äôt mean to say he wouldn‚Äôt be great for this team. It‚Äôs more a matter of where we‚Äôre at in the rebuild. Plus I imagine he‚Äôll want a big payday, and since he‚Äôs definitely not ring-chasing with us I doubt he‚Äôd sign a very team-friendly contract.  In theory, though, yes, Kyle Lowry is exactly the kind of piece we need."
"As a Bulls fan, I disagree. Kyle Lowry absolutely fits this team in terms of the skills and cohesion he would bring ‚Äî high IQ team leader, great playmaker, tough defender ‚Äî but he‚Äôs too old for our timeline. Yes, he‚Äôd bring good experience and stability to our team, but we‚Äôre not at that ‚Äúone piece away‚Äù stage of our rebuild where he‚Äôd put us over the edge into real contention. By the time we reach that stage (even if his presence would get us there more quickly), he‚Äôll likely have declined too much to be useful.  I‚Äôd rather we sign Lonzo. Despite his flaws, he‚Äôd be a perfect complement to Zach in the backcourt with his defense and playmaking, and we could move Coby into a sixth man role where he could focus more on scoring than trying to run the offense."
Kyle Lowry and Chris Paul are better then both
Kyle Lowry is easily better then Murray
"The trade that would kind of make sense for both sides if Kyrie actually plays for Toronto would be Kyle Lowry and Chris Boucher for Kyrie.  Now that Harden‚Äôs here, Kyle may actually provide much more value than Kyrie for this team with his defensive intensity and leadership. Kyle won‚Äôt pout if he doesn‚Äôt get 10 isos a game like Kyrie.   Chris Boucher on the floor with Lowry, Harden, Harris, and KD would be straight up unfair on offence; with no one being less than at league average 3pt shooter.  Assuming Kyrie‚Äôs ok with playing out his contract in Toronto through 2023 (BIG IF), this gives Toronto a 2 year window to compete with Kyrie as the undisputed star and Pascal as a premium second option.  Who knows, maybe Kyrie now wants to be ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù to lead a team deep in the playoffs averaging 35 points a game."
Id rather have kyle lowry.
It does improve their ceiling but I don't think it'd be prudent to rush in Philly. Their stars are still young and on long contracts. If you give up so much for 34 year old Kyle Lowry you might shutter your later chances
"Oladipo isn‚Äôt a good fit in Philly. Needs the ball in his hands, playmaking is up and down, not an efficient half court shot creator, takes too many shots he‚Äôs not good enough to take, doesn‚Äôt complement Embiids skill set really at all. The Oladipo Simmons fit also is no good   Kyle Lowry is the guy who that kind of framework did a trade is something I would consider much stronger if Philly. Danny green mike Scott two protected firsts"
"i think you're going to have to reevaluate your understanding of either this conversation or basketball in general, because no one in their right mind would ever be talking about drafting ""kyle lowry that played out his career on the timberwolves"" 1st overall"
"I dont understand your point, Alvin Williams wasn't as good as Kyle Lowry is .  It has nothing to do with what team he's on, he just wasn't as good at basketball period"
"I love the guy and have his Raptors Dino jersey in my closet, but Kyle Lowry should not be a Hall of Famer.   He's made 1 All NBA team his entire career and his All-Star Game Nominations are primarily a byproduct of him being in a conference with lesser guard play. There's no way he would've scraped all star teams playing in a conference that had Steph, Russ, Harden and Dame..."
"Hard disagree tbh. Once Kawhi left (and to a lesser extent Danny Green), the Raptors were left with a team built around  33 year old Kyle Lowry, 35 year old Gasol and Siakam. Unless you get Giannis, it was time to hand the keys over to Siakam and Anunoby and start the rebuild"
Jimmy butler and kyle lowry for me !
"Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, green alien from Space Jam, Jesus Shuttlesworth, Barack Obama, Paul George is always good for a trade demand, Dr.Naismith, and you‚Äôve gotta watch Elena Della Donne after she broke Chicago fans‚Äô hearts."
Kyle Lowry: And I took that personally
Kyle Lowry over Coby White üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ. Can't take this seriously.
Coby White has been better than Kyle Lowry this year lol
wow they have Kyle Lowry over Kawhi in those rankings.
"Marcus smart and Kyle Lowry flop about the same. From there, Kyle Lowry complains about every single call, whereas smart does not"

Not sure if it‚Äôs irrational because I hate how they play but Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry
"&gt; Would the Raptors be better off if they had Casey‚Äî a proven development coach‚Äî post-Kawhi?  OP is forgetting the entire emergence of Siakam and FVV under Nurse. Throw in OG and even Chris Boucher so far.  Though credit where credit is due, Casey definitely did seem to bring out a lot from all of our young guys, though its tough to tell how much credit the org as a whole or Kyle Lowry deserves in that (for both Casey and Nurse)"
"His offense reminds me of Kyle Lowry, especially that little stop he does near the rim where he keeps the defender at his hip by faking the pass. His jumper also looks quite similar. Now obviously Lowry is much stronger so hes better at throwing his body into bigger players."

Kyle Lowry and Pau Gasol
"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
"This sub if filled with dumbass 10 year olds who look for any and every chance to meme. Somehow a 6‚Äô11‚Äù guy not shooting 3s became the biggest meme on this awful sub because he‚Äôs listed as a PG on b-ref I guess. The Simmons/Embiid pairing on offense will never be perfect, but defensively it‚Äôs special and Simmons is a helluva player. I like the idea that‚Äôs been floated around of the Sixers trading for Kyle Lowry. He can be the primary ball handler in the half court and Ben can function as a something of a Draymond Green on steroids."
"The question I asked was ""Is Kyle Lowry better than Chris Paul?"" as a retort to your nooby rings argument. But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment. You even only quoted the word ""Kyle Lowry"" in your response LOL. You expect someone to sift through that 10th-grade essay when you won't even answer the original question? Good luck with that.  You don't need a word salad of this magnitude to say that James' stats are lower in the playoffs than in the regular season. What I'm trying to help you understand is that even with his lower play-off numbers he still absolutely shows up. Casuals like you are what ruins this sub. You try to use blog-boy analytics while devolving arguments into ""Rings"" or ""Mamba-Mentality"" like you already got roasted for.  You can quote any stats you want but there is a reason why the greatest basketball minds don't spew the nonsense you are trying to push. Here is some context for you. The KD Warriors went 32-6 in the 2017 and 2018 playoffs. 4-3 against Houston, 28-3 against everyone else. So if Harden didn't ‚Äúshow-up‚Äù what did Dame, Bron, AD and everyone else who got swept or a gentleman‚Äôs sweep have? People say Harden disappears in ‚Äúkey games,‚Äù but they just define ‚Äúkey games‚Äù as any game Harden plays poorly in. For example, Harden was on the bench during the 2015 game 6 comeback against the Clippers, but he had 26 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in Game 5, also an **elimination game**. And 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists in Game 7 to complete the **3-1 comeback**. He also dropped 41 pts, 9 rebounds, 6 assists in 2019 Game 3 against GS to avoid going down 3-0. Had 38, 10, and 4 in Game 4 to tie it up at 2-2. Games 5 and 6 of that series, he put up good numbers too.  You are full of fallacies and the one you are spewing right now is a slippery slope. Just because someone's stats are lower in the playoffs doesn't automatically mean they don't ""show-up""."
"&gt;Kyle Lowry  Kyle Lowry doesn't tell his teammates they aren't good enough. Also the conversation was about showing up to the playoffs. Also, Kyle Lowry has a 3 point shooting percentage of 41% when facing elimination over his career. Harden is at 34.6%. Lol. Below average. You may say that's a cherry picked stat but you can compare various stats when it counts. Harden doesn't SHOW UP.  &gt;Again moving the goal-posts. Now to ""show-up"" in the playoffs, you have to lead the league in playoff PPG?   No. You really just don't understand. Winners take over the game when it counts. James Harden is very much like Pandemic P in that his numbers go down in the playoffs and they go down a lot when games are on the line.   Players like Jordan, KD, Lebron, Steph, Leonard, Tim Duncan they turn it up, play more minutes, know they are going to be the focus of the other team and still find ways to dominate the game   Harden's performance when it counts is straight bad. In the past 5 years he has shot 25% from the 3 point line in the 4th quarter and overtime in the playoffs.  The problem is that every year Harden chokes in the playoffs and then a bunch of ""casuals"" forget part way through the season because they didn't watch him in the playoffs.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/james-hardens-disappearing-act-in-another-playoff-fourth-quarter-is-so-on-brand-its-painful-to-watch/  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/3/31/15134562/james-harden-clutch-stats-history-mvp-rockets  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-an-undrafted-rookie-stopped-james-harden-in-the-playoffs/  I gave you actual evidence. If I am the casual and you aren't you will come back with really solid evidence of Harden coming up big in the playoffs.  Good luck with that."
Kyle Lowry was that in 2019
"Oh Kyle Lowry is definitely better, but my point is that Conley‚Äôs value was very high at that point.  It‚Äôll certainly be interesting to see how it plays out, NBA execs value age a ton with this stuff. Teams apparently were more willing to trade for Beal than Harden largely because of age, despite Harden being a much better player."
"Conley averaged 21/6 on good efficiency the year before he got traded to Utah, we know Lowry is better from last year, but an argument could be made that Memphis Conley was better than this year‚Äôs Lowry.  I just think 2 firsts and a young prospect for a 35 year old Kyle Lowry is an overvalue. The Knicks second is gonna be really good this year anyway."
"&gt;Talk to me when he has a ring.  I hope you know that all you do when you say this is flag yourself as a casual, which you clearly are. Any serious basketball analysis, analysts, or discourse always proves the rings argument when used the way you tried to use it as being illogical or a fallacy. Casuals like you use it to either move the goalposts or as a strawman. Quick question, do you think Kyle Lowry is better than Chris Paul because he has a ring? Hopefully not. Rings don't just make you better than another player and are 9/10 times brought up when casuals like you lose debates as you did earlier.  &gt;He has never lead the ppg I'm the playoffs despite winning 3 consecutive scoring titles.  Again moving the goal-posts. Now to ""show-up"" in the playoffs, you have to lead the league in playoff PPG? Lol, stop."
"They're fundamentally the same with a few adjustments that lead to different rankings, which is why I don't put too much stock in the relative ordering they output. For example, ESPN RPM had Kyle Lowry as #1 in 2018 - he was a top player that single year but by no means the best. Only a few select people know ESPN's proprietary RPM formula, which factors in arbitrary attribute such as age and height. Stat enthusiasts implement their own APM models, leading to fuzzy results with no outright consensus formula. Given this, how is one suppose to take APM that seriously?  I have no objections to using advanced stats in tandem with traditional measures for closer comparisons, but armchair analysts these days make bold claims against the tide solely based on advanced stats under the pretense of ""advanced"" analytics."
Without Steph it doesn‚Äôt matter what Draymond does because they‚Äôre at the bottom of the leaugue regardless. How important was Draymond last year? How can he be more important than the player the whole team is designed around? You‚Äòre grasping at straws to try to prove Lowry was more important to the raptors winning than Kawhi when that very clearly wasn‚Äôt the case. Whoever contributes the most to the teams sucess is more important and that certainly wasn‚Äôt Kyle Lowry.
Yea right now they would because Lowry is the one still on the team. He was always #2 at best. Kawhi was on a contender every season he‚Äôs been healthy since he hit his prime. Demar and Kyle couldn‚Äôt get the job done so the raptors got a better player. No one but a raptors fan can say Lowry is better than Kawhi with a straight face.
"Kyle Lowry does not fit positionally, he does not fit the timeline, he is also a free agent so why would the Warriors end all their assets out for him?   Your proposed trade makes zero sense. It won't happen.   Also you do realize the trade deadline has passed, yes? Any trades will have to happen in the off season and the Warriors also are not looking to be hard capped by a sign and trade, which is the only way a Lowry deal gets done during his free agency due to the Warriors being capped out.   If Washington wanted to build for the future Wiseman, Wiggins and a top 6 FRP would *absolutely* get Beal, if there were mutual interest there which I don't think there is. Warriors like guys who defend.   What the Warriors *need* to do is cut Smiley and Mulder this off season, try to re-sign Oubre for an off the bench role, actually **use** their first round draft picks, get more development for Wiseman, for their other lotto picks, and then see how the trade market develops as the season goes on.  You see you can't forget that they kind of need to know how Klay is going to look before they make major roster moves. Klay's under contract for several more seasons on a max and if he can't play at a high level when he comes back that kind of fucks the Warriors before they've even started trying to compete, as his money is nearly 1/3 of the payroll.   Your proposed trade package is... highly unlikely.  &gt;Wiseman has negative value because he's a high school prospect C  Hardcore smooth brain take"
"I think it's similar to Kyle Lowry and Kawhi in 2019.  Kawhi better player but Lowry was more important. He was the only one that could dictate offense, if not it would be Kawhi ISO till the wheels fall off. ISO-ball might win you a game, it won't lead you to second or third rounds.  I would say though Chris Paul is the best player on the Suns. The leadership and basketball IQ for both ends of the floor is what makes them great."
"Guy I replied to said this so I responded:      ""Which one is those will be a free agent this off season or will be disgruntled and wanting a trade?  Don't expect the Warriors to overreact.""   \---  What are you expecting to get for Wiseman. The guy above me said he wanted an all star that was coming off a contract or had team control for the future so I suggested Kyle Lowry, because he ticks all of those boxes despite the fit being a bit ugly and having to play Klay as a SF.     He's an all star/HoF type player. He brings parts of the game that Curry doesn't have. He plays SG. He impacts winning.     I don't think the haul is really that much considering we'd be giving up Lowry+ swapping picks. I'm not sure how much yall value Wiseman but you'd likely be getting one of our younger players as filler.     Reason I suggested Lowry and not cause it's fair is because others in the thread have suggested that Wiseman has negative value because he's a high school prospect C. Raptors are a C needy team, and Wiseman fits the core's age (GTJ/OG/him are all relatively in the same bracket.""     &amp;#x200B;  Lowry isn't disgruntled but he's okay with being traded, he's a free agent at the end of the season and he's relatively the same age as Steph Curry and would definitely help them win assuming they could find a real center to pair with them. Or am I wrong. Cause Steph/KLow/Klay/Dray/X piece looks pretty damn good to me. I hesitated throwing Siakam or Fred in but the trade would make a lot more sense if we threw Siakam in but now the salaries are even more convoluted and matching is much harder. Do we throw you guys Siakam+Fred for Wiseman+Wiggins? We definitely wouldn't be swapping picks anymore, and you're gonna have to tag some future ones on because that would signal a full scale rebuild in Toronto around OG.     We can discuss that things but the salary starts approaching 85M if you start including our star players. Would you guys want Fred instead? I'm not sure the answer there, because Fred doesn't tick the disgruntled, free agent superstar but we do control him - he's not a hall of fame talent and he hasn't made an all star game.     You guys aren't getting Beal for Wiseman+Wiggins and a first that may or may not convey. It's gonna take more than that. I don't think that package gets you a superstar."
"LOL, if the Raps want a package like that we **won't** take your Kyle Lowry problem (aging star on a big contract) the Raps would need to include Siakam and OG.  Teams always propose ridiculous trades that are heavily stacked in their team's favor and go ""What about this, this sounds fair!"""
Kyle Lowry nods in approval.
Because Kyle Lowry and Tim Duncan carried Kawhi to titles
Kyle ‚Äúthicc but cute‚Äù Lowry
Kyle Lowry does though. Maybe he is the best leader and y'all don't give him enough respect.
"A lot depends on Kyle tbh. He's happy here too so re-signing wouldn't be bad. We're not obligated to do a sign-and-trade with Philly, especially since Lowry could just walk to Miami outright. So it depends on how badly the 6ers want him because there is direct competition for him from a rival."
"Lowry is an NBA champ already as the second best player on the 2019 team. He really doesn't need to ring-chase like those other dudes. (DMC on the 'Dubs)   I really think he'll take the biggest contract he can get this summer instead of a pay-cut to be a third of fourth piece for a ""contender""   Kyle Lowry  ain't no ring chaser lol, this ain't DeMarcus cousins."
"Kyle is a national icon. The influence he will have on Canadian basketball! They talk about ‚ÄúThe Carter Effect‚Äù and the influence he had on Canadian basketball... Ja, Wiggins, Olynyk, TT, Anthony Bennett.....  Just imagine ‚ÄúThe Lowry Effect‚Äù"
"As a Rockets fan, I love that Kyle Lowry not only won a championship, but he brought Toronto their first, and did it in a manner that ensures he'll always be considered a Raptors franchise legend. Kyle Lowry was one of my favorite Rockets. Bill Worrell sums it up -- to paraphrase, there's nobody I'd rather share a fox hole with than Kyle Lowry."
"For me, I like being able to jump on a $15 bus to NYC a few times a year for special occasions, but otherwise living in a significantly more affordable city where I can pick up groceries, eat at interesting restaurants, and go to my office without needing a car. I like that I was able to do a mission driven job and still afford to buy a house in a neighborhood where several of my close friends were also able to afford homes. We have a little community that is planning to be here for a while. It would have been impossible for any of us to settle down in that way in Brooklyn‚Äîwe were born 15-20 years too late.  For Kyle Lowry, of course, none of my reasons are relevant."
"Weird how he could carry Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry to a championship but not Paul George and Patrick Beverley, hmmm..."
Kyle Lowry being your franchises best player ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
"I remember when Kyle was drafted and a year later, I was at the Grizzlies draft party where Kyle Lowry was the player host and saw his facial expression when it was announced the Grizzlies had drafted Mike Conley.  So if Kyle feels old...."
"Was he really though? Kyle Lowry was definitely the second option/player. Siakam balled out that title run, but he was a bit closer to Fred VanVleet than being 2nd best on a title team."
"I can‚Äôt explain why, but up until a couple of years ago I straight up didn‚Äôt like Kyle Lowry.  Can‚Äôt explain why, I just did.  But in the last couple of years I‚Äôve seen so much of him outside of basketball that he‚Äôs turned into one of my favorite players to watch on and off the court.  It also helps he‚Äôs a thicc boi and I do like em thicc"
"KYLE LOWRY HAS ENTERED THE CHAT.     Kyle and a pickswap if the Raptors don't win the lottery.     Raps get Wiseman, Wiggins, and pick #4, Warriors get pick #8, Kyle Lowry and Aron Baynes"
Kyle Lowry seems like a cool dude.  Good for them and the Raptors for doing this stuff with kids.
"The Athletic's Sam Amick and John Hollinger reported Wednesday the Sixers ""still plan on pursuing"" Toronto Raptors star Kyle Lowry in a potential sign-and-trade after having failed to get him prior to the trade deadline."
A lot of people will probably remember when a fan said to Lowry after a game that Butler was his favorite player and Kyle whipped out his phone and called Butler so the fan could tell him himself. It must have sent jolts of dopamine through that kid.

IIRC 17-18 was our 59 win season where Casey had changed our entire offense based on what Nurse had planned. No more Demar/Kyle iso ball and more of a passing transformation with Demar running point. In the first few weeks the team had a difficult time adjusting to it (mostly Lowry because he had the most to sacrifice). He was pretty critical of it too because his stats were cut until we started winning again.
"All very good points, you'd probably in that situation have to double down though, and trade an injured Murray to a re-building team with an all-star player. In this hypothetical maybe you move Murray to get either John Wall or Kyle Lowry and just hope Lowry OR Wall/Harden/Jokic is enough to get over whatever everyone else puts together in that year.   I think even in all-in situations there are potential outs if something goes awry but still, at the end of the day it's always a decision of if it's worth depleting the stock of draft picks and having a period of 5+ years of being a dumpster fire of a team just to have 1-2 years where you can actually have a real chance of winning."
In a game with Kevin Durant kyrie Irving Kyle Lowry siakam and ffv MIKE JAMES was the guy who took over in the 4th.   I don‚Äôt wanna see the raps ever again gg

Kyle Lowry is Butler‚Äôs kids godfather?   Woah lol.
"&gt; Flair up loser.  Love the high quality discourse.  &gt;Imagine bringing up Kyle Lowry throwing basketballs at a ref while teams got accused accused domestic abusers on their team.  I brought up Kyle Lowry pleading guilty to battering a ref in response to someone claiming they ""can't understand anyone who doesn't think he's one of the most quality guys in the NBA off the court.""  The fact that he's better than the worst (domestic abusers) does not make him one of the best. I would guess a very low percentage of NBA players have pled guilty to battering a woman."

Kyle Lowry was the second option in 2019. Beal can definitely be a second option on a contender
This is what makes it all the more remarkable how bad Baynes was.  Kyle Lowry makes bigs look good.
"I agree, you'd see players like Lebron and CP3 are probably the most efficient offensive players in totality but people tend to think scorers like Curry and KD are the hallmarks of efficiency because of their shooting, which obviously they are.    But a player like Kyle Lowry compared to a player like Kyrie Irving would be more interesting if there was a more all-encompassing stat."
Was that really a thing?? I‚Äôm like 2 years old in this sub and all I‚Äôve seen are Kyle Lowry and Demar DeRozan wholesome posts.

Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry
"Raptors were fined for misreporting injuries, albeit minor ones.   &gt; ‚ÄúThe Raptors were fined $25,000 for the Friday game against the Orlando Magic in which Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam were listed out for rest.  &gt;The Toronto Star‚Äôs Doug Smith explained the fine wasn‚Äôt simply due to the rest, but because after the Raptors had listed the three as out for rest, head coach Nick Nurse said Anunoby had knee swelling and Lowry was dealing with a chronic foot infection.  &gt;Because of that discrepancy between the injury report and Nurse‚Äôs pregame remarks, the team was fined.‚Äù"
And both are more impactful than Kyle  Not related it‚Äôs just funny that Raptors fans used to think dame Lowry was a discussion lmao
"His thiccness Kyle Lowry, duh"
"&gt; Sure, man. You can have your opinion, and I can have mine.   For sure! It is just one of us has an opinion based on objective fact and the other one has their feelings lol  &gt; Did Tatum (while certainly inexperienced himself) beat an inexperienced Sixers team and then a Raptors team who, whole defending champs, were minus their best player from their championship run to make the ECF twice?  A. Tatum led the Celtics past the Sixers (sans Simmons, tbf) in a 4 game sweep and then, without our 2nd best player, beat the 2nd seed Raptors who had an all-nba 2nd team leader and Kyle Lowry going off. This was also only one year  B. He also, at 19, helped lead our team past the Giannis and Middleton Bucks to get to the ECF where he famously dunked all over Bron in a game 7 that the celtics narrowly lost  It is great that you ""think"" a lot of things, but ""thinking"" something without using any objective facts, reason, or you know... thought, doesn't make it very valuable now does it.   &gt; Sorry the Celtics lost so many games to injury. Ever heard the saying ""The best ability is availability""?  How is this relevant at all? Your argument was that Tatum is bad because we have a slightly worse record than the Knicks. I am saying that isn't on Tatum at all. He has been wonderful this season. If we adjusted for estimated wins lost per our teams respective injuries, we would actually be 2 games ahead of the knicks lol.   Your takes aren't hot, they are stupid and based on your feel feels. Let me see you drop any actual stats and not nephew opinions and then you can join the adults at the dinner table  Have a good one, kid ;)"
"Idk how many seasons into his career it was, but Kyle Lowry def made a jump once he got to Toronto"
Steve Nash went from a run of the mill All-Star to all-time great offensive god and repeat MVP at like 30   Kyle Lowry went from a below average/mediocre bum to legitimate All-NBA guard very deep into his career
Kyle Lowry going off at the beginning of a finals game a couple years ago. I think it was game 7 and I was hyped. He‚Äôs a damn good player but usually isn‚Äôt so aggressive with scoring

"You're right I don't remember ""all of this shit"". I was 10 years old when they lost the double OT game to the spurs.  But from a quick search about it, it didn't seem as big an issue as you suggest, Ed Davis seemed perfectly fine with it  [https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors-ed-davis-thinks-dwane-casey-was-right-to-stick-with-andrea-bargnani](https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors-ed-davis-thinks-dwane-casey-was-right-to-stick-with-andrea-bargnani)  It speaks to a larger point in which I do think Casey who was respected and well liked by the players, and who motivated the players to play with maximum effort. In many ways I see similarities (and shortcomings) with him and Thibs (and the difference in results between the knicks and pistons this year is mainly due to roster construction).  As to your points, while there was probably so tension between kyle and casey after losing again in the playoffs but at the same time both have said publicly that they've maintained a good relationship.  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2775591-kyle-lowry-calls-dwane-casey-1-of-the-best-coaches-ive-ever-had-after-firing](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2775591-kyle-lowry-calls-dwane-casey-1-of-the-best-coaches-ive-ever-had-after-firing)  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2774975-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry-support-raptors-hc-dwane-casey-amid-hot-seat-rumors](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2774975-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry-support-raptors-hc-dwane-casey-amid-hot-seat-rumors)  Many other raptors players have said how much they've liked casey and how he's improved as a coach.  As for playoffs series you're right for the most part (though I do remember a fairly easy series against the wizards a second time around when they played in 2018). I honestly didn't mind the fact that they were difficult because they were always exciting and we won against everyone except the cavs in the last 3 years.  And lastly JV did play some fourth quarter minutes. I think most raptors fans remember his missed buzzer beater against the cavs in game 1 2017/2018. And while he did improve his defense while on the raptors and is still improving he did seem to get exposed constantly the playoffs. (see the massive difference in field goal rating). I think this would still be true today despite his improvements.  [https://www.raptorscage.ca/raptors-projection-2018-19-the-tragic-tale-of-jonas-valanciunas/](https://www.raptorscage.ca/raptors-projection-2018-19-the-tragic-tale-of-jonas-valanciunas/)  [https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/4/21/22381808/the-defensively-misunderstood-jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-nba](https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/4/21/22381808/the-defensively-misunderstood-jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-nba)  Altogether I think while there was shortcomings with Casey that you clearly remember, there is some revisionist history going on by raptors fans to paint him as a largely net negative coach when judging from the players and the record of the team, it isn't at all the case."
This is one of the hardest teams to try and reconstruct because they weren‚Äôt superstars but they fit really well  Chauncey Billups- Kyle Lowry  Rip Hamilton- Joe Ingles  Tayshaun Prince- Talen Horton-Tucker   Rasheed Wallace- Michael Porter Jr.   Ben Wallace- Clint Capela   The team that I built isn‚Äôt as good on defense but is better offensively
Just goes to show late players can still turn their career around. No one in 2013 could've predicted that 27-year-old Kyle Lowry would become a 6x All-Star and championship point guard.
"In his rockets days, there was also the whole female ref situation that probably didn't help his reputation in general  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/7432477/houston-rockets-kyle-lowry-charged-battery-las-vegas"
Kyle Lowry and the bench was consistently our best lineup during the DeMar years. Lowry is a direct contributor to DeMar's negative net rating LMAO.
"So have a lot of players. Like Kyle Lowry, his teammate."

"I didn‚Äôt realize you were trying to stretch it this far.  They literally say it was the starting package for PG. The Thunder wouldn‚Äôt just throw in Westbrook for free. Neither of the quotes you said say that the Thunder offered PG and Westbrook for the offer you said in the post, just that there was a trade package built around George and Westbrook. It would have had to at least include Kyle Lowry also, and probably another filler and another pick or two.   The contracts for the trade you listed literally just don‚Äôt work.   But yeah, I‚Äôm sure Prest, one of the best GMs in the league said ‚Äúhey Raptors, here is this solid offer that is pretty fair and contracts match. Oh, you don‚Äôt want that? Alright, I guess we will throw in the guy that won MVP the year before and still an All NBA/All Star player even though the salaries don‚Äôt match at all!‚Äù  Just use some common sense bro."
"Okay, so mean is not an advanced metric. It is literally the most basic statistic ever. Mean is when you add all individuals in a data set and divide by the total number of data points. It's the average. We learn it in 6th grade. Outliers are the ones that are farthest to either end, ones that don't fall in with the rest of the data points. These are basic concepts, not advanced metrics. Beyond that, the 3.5% metric was me using the exact same metric you did in the previous comment when you said he wasn't top 15. You can't gatekeep the use of data, even data based on guesses, so only you can make any up.   The whole reason Kyle Lowry was brought up in the first place is how he plays defense on Steph. He holds off ball, gets in his landing space, undercuts him and pushes when the refs aren't looking, similar to how Dellevadova and others play against him. He is by no means the only or the first player to do it. In that scenario, he plays illegal defense which can result in injury (in this case minor scratches and gouges, ankle strain and sometimes worse). In any case, it's kinda dirty. Beyond that, there have been more than ""a dirty highlight or two"" to prove Lowry's reputation. The first commenter brought three up off-top and a whole thread filled with other examples (some video, some admittedly anecdotal). I'm not trying to say he's the dirtiest player on earth, he's no PatBev or Delle, but he's made enough dirty plays to warrant the label of 'dirty' by most of the fans who's team he plays against.   As a raptors fan (I'm guessing, no flair), of course you would die on this hill, I get it. I was basically a Zaza apologist for like a half-season. I thought Draymond's foot was trying to make a play for like a year. The thing is, it wasn't up to me, and I isn't up to you. You hold inherent bias toward your guy, just like every fan. The greater public (albeit the gutter-dwelling public of r/nba) has given him the label already, and that's that. Keep arguing if you want, the court of public opinion doesn't change their mind very easily."
it‚Äôs astounding how kyle lowry played 36 god damn minutes and he scored 4 fucking points
Lou Williams Kyle Lowry seem to get a lot
Dennis Schroeder? Lonzo Ball? Kyle Lowry? It‚Äôs not great but not terrible

"Kyle Lowry is not playing well, which means he'll have 16 in the 4th quarter."
Kyle Lowry

"First play dude clearly holds on to Kyle's leg to slow down the Raptors break. Beal got in his feelings bc Lowry didnt give him a free two points? Bruh he instantly raised his hand and indicated he fucked up too. Theres a distinction between dirty and aggressive. Dudes like Pachulia, Bev, Bowen, Laimbeer get an erection from these moments. Kyle is just tryna hoop you saltyass"
"Ad sitting out, lebron out, harden out, klay out, Trae out, lamello out, Jamal Murry out, embid played less games than lebron despite lebron being out for 4 weeks, Ben Simmons out, Lonzo out, wym other players are banged up and we not noticing?  Kawhi and Paul George loading managing.  Pat bev is out.  The spurs just got fined for sitting players and Toronto sat practically every single one of their starters last week.  When asked about it the coach pretty much said ""yeah idk why Kyle Lowry isn't playing.  I think he's tired.""    You're dumb af lol"
"Dude is gonna die on the sword of Tyler Herro.  Pat Riley really screwed it this year. I think the heat just aren‚Äôt sure if they‚Äôre a rebuilding team around Herro and Bam, or a contending team around Dragic and Butler so they signed Oladipo instead of Kyle Lowry and didn‚Äôt trade herro for James Harden. That was honestly so stupid, and our front office traded Luka."
Kyle Lowry has many of the Raptors records and is considered the team GOAT. He'll be remembered. But someone like Millsap or Middleton are great but are missing accolades and the same level of fan support.
He'd be what Kyle Lowry is
From your least most to least likely to be forgotten:   Marc Gasol   Demar Derozan    Ben Simmons    Kyle Lowry    Damian Lillard
"At least 100,000 raptors fans including me will literally never shut up talking about kyle lowry so he definitely won't be forgotten."
"Bruv do you realize in the past 7-8 years beside the raptors is just been lebron or curry winning the title right? So by that logic nobody is a great player besides Lebron, Curry and Kyle Lowry"
"Never trade Kyle Lowry please, he's Raptors heart and soul"
"kyle lowry is a better post defender than harden and westbrook dude, by both numbers and eye test"
Damn I hate kyle Lowry. But only because he doesn't play for my team.  I think he would be most people's favorite  player in almost every team in the NBA.
"Kyle and Demar are amazing leaders. It's almost crazy picturing a team being led by Siakam, FVV, and OG since I still think of them as kids under Derozan and Lowry."
Kyle Lowry to replace Kenny pls
Also does this? Don't think saying Kyle Lowry does it means the Lakers don't lol

so lebron james = mj+ kyle lowry. that actually checks out
"Yeah for sure, this whole post is about putting things in context lol. Using Kyle Lowry, a great player in his own right, as the measuring stick"
Kawhi needed a Pointguard more then anything as a number 2 if he‚Äôs to make it work. Idk who‚Äôs available but when you have a guy like Kyle Lowry and Tony Parker/Ginobli(even tho they were old af) who can play make and run the offense at a high level it makes his job easier to where all he has to do is get buckets and defend. This Clips team is built terribly
"In order (that are under 6‚Äô2):  1. Chris Paul  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Mike Conley    They just play smart and don‚Äôt make many mistakes. They all aren‚Äôt defensive liabilities either even though they‚Äôre under-sized compared to a lot of the newer combo guard type of guys. I‚Äôd say what sets them apart is their leadership and IQ on the floor. CP3 is the point god and an all-time great floor general. Lowry is the heart and soul of Toronto. Conley is a bit more under the radar, but he‚Äôs literally been awarded for his likability as a teammate and sportsman."
"He absolutely has not been the main facilitator on all of his teams lmao in 2019 it was kyle lowry who was the main facilitator. With Kawhi they just gave him the ball at his spots and let him go to work. 2020 arguably yes, and he didn't do a great job at it, which isn't surprising considering that isn't his role. 2021 it has been paul george and rajon rondo by far. Kawhi doesn't even like to bring the ball up the court"
Dr. Kyle Lowry also
"Lmaoo, I can see Kyle Lowry doing this for sure"
Playoff Kawhi had an actual playmaker/floor general in Kyle Lowry back then. PG13 is a straightup downgrade from KLow 1:1 when you consider they‚Äôre on a roster reliant on Pat Bev to facilitate for them
 &gt;Paul George   Kyle Lowry
"kyle lowry scored 0 points, how did you not play bad?"
She only likes the kinda tough nut Kyle Lowry has
I mean Kawhi still did that during this regular season that just passed (a lot of iso ball). Although PG took up more of a role facilitating or creating for himself this year too.  But Kawhi had a lot of spurts during that raptors run where he was cold on on offense and other players on that team went off. Siakim thrived with the spacing Kawhi provided and Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet both played like all stars in the post season.  Kawhi was the anchor of the defense on that team but that team was full of high IQ players and a really good system built around them. All the pieces put together really complimented each other well.
Kyle Lowry has changed the league
"lmao carrying a team that has Kyle Lowry, Pascal, FVV, Ibaka, Marc Gasol?   Who basically got a top seed with Kawhi playing like 2/3rd of the season? Who played the Warriors without KD and Klay?   Lol hitting a buzzer beater doesn't mean you're amazing lol. Dame has hit plenty, Luka had a huge one last year. Doesn't make you a top 5 player.   Next thing you'll tell me is Kawhi carried the '14 spurs to a ring too."
"Yes, Kyle Lowry is a great player, Siakam really took a leap that year. If I remember correctly Ibaka also played there. They had fvv it was a pretty good squad plus the much of facing an injured GSW team"
"Idk bro, that may b tru but tyrese is definitely a project for ur team. He aint no oubre yet.  but Killian got the flowin cut with that yung thicc kyle lowry thing going. u definitely want to give us ty so he can gradually improve his looks over the next 3-4 years, before being sexy contender ready  Edit: definitely not because hes really good or anything"
Jrue Holiday and Kyle Lowry should have more all-defensive team selections
"I'm sure he is a high IQ guy, but not in the realm of gamesmanship of Rondo or CP3, or the ability to direct defensice adjustments like Draymond Green. Like most things, there are levels to this. Those guys plus LeBron and Kyle Lowry imo are just above the rest."
Kyle Lowry trash hopefully he leaves
Dude's in his sophomore year in the league too. Nowadays people act like if you're not instantly a star you're a complete bust. It took Kyle Lowry 9 years until he blossomed. Now he's a 6x all-star and champion.
Serves Jordan Poole right he turned it over. Dude was pulling out his best Kyle Lowry impression at the end of regulation

"Well, I think thats the problem. Most teams know they aren't winning it all this year, and honestly unless they draft a generational talent, they wont the next 2 years either, unless a few big name players like lebron, kd, harden, giannis, jokic w/e get hurt. so they say, we will try to plan for the future. There aren't any free agents they can sign that will change their outlook, and no team with a bonafied star is looking to trade them (we saw that with beal and lowry this year). For that matter, if a truly bad team even gets a kyle lowry, it will just take them from bad to play in. I do kinda agree with you though, maybe there should be some benefit to actually doing well in a season, outside of draft placements. Maybe the play ins will do just that, they will bring a lot of excitement to teams that are almost good/facing elimination which probably makes the org more money since more people are exposed to them."

"Yeah if Chris Paul is getting all this love then I‚Äôm pretty pissed that Kyle Lowry didn‚Äôt even get consideration for all NBA last season, when he did basically the exact same thing as CP3."
"Toronto's scheme didn't cause him to miss point blank layups and dunks or have hands of stone üòÇ.  He wasn't asked to do much and fell short of those low standards.  Kyle Lowry has helped lots of big men get paid, from stone hands like Biyombo to Ibaka."
"He deserves to be in our current hall of fame no question. I just think our current hall of fame is just too accepting in general. Maybe about 10 players per generation. Guys like Aldridge or Kyle Lowry have a legitimate HOF case with our current HOF, but I wouldn‚Äôt say they are close to the best of our generation."
[Kyle Lowry Flop](https://youtu.be/dtCFvuqryfY)
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Kyle Lowry and it's not close
MJ -&gt; Kwame Brown -&gt; Kyle Lowry  The GOATs
Kyle Lowry about to play 46 minutes every game
5 separate Russell and Kyle Lowry
For the Raptors heads: One degree of separation between the first draft pick the Toronto Raptors ever made in Damon Stoudamire and the last pick the Raptors made in Jalen Harris.  That common link? Kyle Lowry.
"Rumor: Kyle Lowry intends to sign a 3-year deal with the Peach State Hawks, per source"
Trying to take a charge and actually taking contact isn't an egregious flop. Are you furious every minute Kyle Lowry plays basketball?
"Seeing Caruso play well, Schroder struggle and THT play 0 minutes in the 2nd half, really brings back up the Lowry trade and if that would have helped solidify this team (spoiler alert....it would have). Obviously this is 1 game, and this is reactionary, but hey...love me some Kyle Lowry."
I will die on the hill that Kyle Lowry should be playing on this team.
"Couldve been in on Jrue Holiday. Great fit imo.  Kyle Lowry was available.  Warriors probably could've topped what Houston got for Harden, lol"
"GETTIN A BETTER PICK THAN LEBRONTO THO, SAY GOODBYE TO KYLE LOWRY TRASH BRO #1"
"Kyle Lowry and the Raptors. He had a whole career before going up north but I don't associate him with any of it.  Edit: crap, he's not a role player. SORRY!"
Both Kyle (not Lowry) and DeRozan fell off after 2017
Pelicans should sign Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan and reunite the best buds for an awesome starting 5
When Kyle Lowry plays--the Raptors are trying to win. When he doesn't play--the Raptors are trying to lose.
I remember this being a point of emphasis used against Kyle Lowry for many years whenever the Raptors would struggle.
"It's definitely a stat that needs context and &lt;gasp&gt; game-watching to provide that context. Look at some other names in the ""top"" 30 for players with highest TOV% and we see: Ben Simmons, Facundo Campazzo, Ricky Rubio, LaMelo Ball, Goran Dragic, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Ja Morant, LeBron James. What these guys all have in common is that they don't take many shots ***relative*** to how much ball handling they do. For sure a couple guys (Trae and LeBron especially) shoot and score a lot, but they do *even more* ball handling relative to their teammates."
"Hmm, yeah, a sign and trade would be great if they can get it. I still have regrets about my squad failing to trade Tyreke in '18 and losing him for nothing without even making an offer that offseason. Obviously Tyreke is not Kyle Lowry, but it still sucks to see assets wasted."
Kemba somehow flops more than Kyle Lowry god damn he sucks to watch
shades of kyle lowry
"It‚Äôs definitely important, especially if you have a PG that can find that center for countless easy looks. For example, Lowry/Baynes dynamic was horrible because Kyle would constantly dime him up but Baynes has feet for hands."
Kyle Lowry has entered the chat
"Kyrie was on a top of the line defensive team, hello? The 2017-2018 Celtics were literally the best defensive team in the NBA. They were better defensively than we were. Kyrie got exactly 0 MVP votes and couldn't make 3rd team over Oladipo or DeRozan. He was also the clear second fiddle kn the team behind Tatum to the point that Kyrie started sulking and demanded a trade.   Sometimes I think this gets overlooked so I just want to repeat it. Kyrie has made two All-NBA teams. Since his career began he was overlooked for All-NBA in favor of such superstars as Demar DeRozan (twice), Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo.  At no point since 2014 has Kyrie been the best player on his team. The top 7 players in the NBA could all miss an entire season and he would still not be a serious MVP contender because guys like PG, Dame and Butler are just better than he is. Kyrie has incredible skill, but he's not an MVP level player."
So like Kyle Lowry vs Nerlens Noel
"This is so true.  ""Fucking idiots over at r/nba just shitpost smh""  *2 seconds later*  Posts ""Is there anyone thiccer than Kyle Lowry?"" On r/nba"
It's never worked like that.  Record matters.  Kyle Lowry has been an All-Star for years but not this season.  Why? Record.
"‚ÄúYour effort is too inconsistent, I‚Äôm leaving you for Kyle Lowry.‚Äù"
"Lol RPM loves Kyle Lowry. Past 5 years, he's like near the top every year"
Okay Kyle Lowry did it to win the nba finals no one brings it up
What about signing Kyle Lowry to 2 years $60m?
Cause RPM is an embarassing stat  I'm a Kyle Lowry fanatic and I can't defend RPM having him as the best player of 2018 lmao
"Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo 100% would"
Don‚Äôt think a 36 year old Kyle Lowry will ‚Äúend our championship window‚Äù lol
Trae ‚ÄúJames ‚ÄòMarcus ‚ÄòKyle ‚ÄòLeBron ‚ÄòManu Ginobili‚Äô James‚Äô Lowry‚Äô Smart‚Äô Harden‚Äù Young.
True but remember Lebron tried to get Kawhi to join him and AD. Lakers also were in talks for Kyle Lowry this past trade deadline. All these teams trying to stack talent lol. I understand folks won‚Äôt go that deep into context but still.
"There‚Äôs a huge difference between scrub and HoF. Webber is definitely hall of very good, along with bibby, jermaine o Neal, Kyle Lowry. I would actually say he‚Äôs better than these dudes but come on the hall of fame should be prestigious."
"You know the basketball honors committee includes journalists, right? Getting into the baseball hall of fame actually means something because of how rare it is. Right now, there are probably 25+ active NBA players who will be in the basketball hall of fame. Kyle Lowry will probably make the basketball hall of fame at this rate."
"Oh okay sweet  Get fucked losers, reigning normal season nba champs Kyle Lowry is better than pussy ass Steph Curry"
Kyle Lowry: ‚ÄúWE‚ÄôLL GIVE YOU TERRENCE ROSS‚Äù
"Nothing will change from this year to next other than Butler coming off his best year ever, an improved Bam, an improved Duncan, an improved Herro, and an improved Nunn.   Really the only loss is Dragic being even older, but he already looks mighty old as is. They can always add Lowry to the team this summer for free in terms of surrendering assets.  In a league where stars are consistently demanding trades, giving up the few amount of assets you have for a 36 year old point guard is painfully dumb.   All of this is ignoring that Kyle Lowry doesn't make us favorites to win the East, like at all lol. Very much still underdogs."
"You don't understand basketball. You clearly didn't watch Toronto's championship run.  The disrespect and pure ignorance about what Kyle Lowry, Freddy VanVleet and Pascal Siakam brought to the table in that championship run. OG Anunoby was injured and didn't play either. You're dumb AF. Sad salty Dallas fan! Toronto rookie backcourt both dropped career highs, 57 points combined in Dallas. LUL One and done team! LUL"
"Wow the disrespect and pure ignorance about what Kyle Lowry, Freddy VanVleet and Pascal Siakam brought to the table in that championship run. OG Anunoby was injured and didn't play either.  You're dumb AF. Sad salty Dallas fan! Toronto rookie backcourt both dropped career highs, 57 points combined in Dallas. LUL One and done team! LUL"
"Sadly the guard position is uber stacked and trust me I know this as a Raptors and Kyle Lowry Fan. Therefore, Randle is a lock to make all nba but Trae is not"
Kyle Lowry is famous for that.
Kyle Lowry in Memphis. I always just assumed that he got drafted by Houston.
Lol as if Kyle Lowry would be out there right now carrying this team to victory?
"Look, AD is their most important player. I got downvoted for saying that but you see what happens when he doesn't play.  Kyle Lowry would have done nothing for them. If Davis is out, they lose...simple."
Maybe they should‚Äôve given up THT* for Kyle Lowry?  *which would‚Äôve also included Schroeder lol
"If that‚Äôs the case, I guess it‚Äôs only fair to make NBA players wear booty shorts as well.  *Kyle Lowry has entered the chat*"
Kemba for Kyle Lowry.
"It‚Äôs the difference between being able to sign Kawhi Leonard while keeping Nunn and Robinson (an attractive situation for Kawhi to go to) and needing to trade everyone on the roster, including Herro, except Bam/Jimmy, to be able to afford Kawhi (a not so attractive situation).  Alternatively it would have let them bring in Kyle Lowry + another role player (Ibaka, re-sign Oladipo, Markannen) instead of just being able to sign Lowry."
"Yeah, it still helps. It‚Äôs the difference between being able to make a full bid for Kawhi Leonard while retaining Robinson and Nunn too, and having to trade everyone except Bam and Jimmy to have the space to sign Kawhi.  It‚Äôs the difference between having the cap space to sign Kyle Lowry and another guy (Oladipo, Ibaka, Markannen) and only being able to sign just Lowry.  Bam not having the patience to wait made it much harder for the Heat to improve their roster this summer."
Kyle Lowry is perfect for them
"Schroder just overplayed his hand is all. He looked good in the first couple months of the season with the Lakers. Like really good. I‚Äôm not surprised that he leveraged the Laker‚Äôs cap situation banking on them paying him more or losing him for the sunken cost of a first round pick. His play has genuinely been up and down for a good bit now and he has slowly eroded into a high turnover low percentage outside shooting point guard. One of his main issues is he has a difficult time shooting 3‚Äôs off the dribble, his release is weird and slow, and now he‚Äôs definitely not even considering shooting them even when open. LeBron is already a ball dominant high turnover player due to his play making duties. What the Lakers really needed was a rock solid efficient PG that could also contribute with spacing by shooting the 3 well.  If Schroder walks which is looking likely the Lakers are going to need to go full blast at someone like Kyle Lowry on a 2 or 3 year deal and hope that he comes at an affordable rate and doesn‚Äôt break down."
Could suns go after Kyle Lowry? He wants $50 million over two years.
Or Kyle Lowry. Wasn‚Äôt Iverson pretty short too? Though his game would be pretty hard to emulate. Hell maybe even Trae Young
"&gt; Good think Kawhi was there so Kyle can call himself a champion lmao  Yes, that's how the NBA works. You need superstars to win championships. To belittle Lowry for that is moronic."
"Right. The pieces they were banking on and didn't want to trade underperformed and Kyle Lowry would have helped with their injuries and to pick up that slack.   I'm saying we know this now so in retrospect, both teams were wrong."
Yeah Suns aren't keep CP3. So are they getting Rubio back? No way Kyle Lowry won't demand a big fat one either.
"Certainly seems like a guy playing his best ball from age 22-25 requires explanation but look at some [nba aging curves](https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+aging+curve&amp;rlz=1C1ZCEB_enUS844US844&amp;oq=nba+aging+curve&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59.3425j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) and mourn your fleeting youth.  The most common peak is about 25-26 years old, so for every Kyle Lowry or Steve Nash who peak after 30 there's gotta be at least a couple Blake Griffins and Ben Gordon's who peak sooner."

Kyle Lowry wouldn‚Äôt lose that ball
"Yup, they need a point guard. Unfortunate they didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) have the assets for Kyle Lowry."
Kyle Lowry would be the ideal pick up.
"He didn't do as well as Kawhi lmao. No goalposts moved. I noted the top 5 player teammate thing because it's kind of relevant... Kawhi joined up with Paul George/Kyle Lowry. Chris Paul joined up with James Harden. There is a massive gap in skill between Lowry and Harden/George and Harden. Context matters  He does get criticized and criticized fairly but saying he coasts on reputation is such a bad take. He's still that dude! He's still a top 5 player and it's not just based on a finals run from 2 years ago, it's based on what he's still doing today"
"Definitely either DeMar DeRozan or Kyle Lowry. I‚Äôd take DeMar simply because he‚Äôs younger, but Lowry is a better playmaker than DeRozan for sure (although DeRozan is no scrub either). There‚Äôs really not much else enticing unrestricted free agents hitting the market this offseason."
"He looks like he could use a Tony Parker or Kyle Lowry to be that guy next to him, oh wait."
Just wait till they sign Kyle Lowry and Kawhi with all that cap space and sign and trade randle for some pieces.
The disrespect to Kyle Lowry
"The point is that saying ‚ÄòPascal averaged 20 PPG on 50% shooting in the finals‚Äô is stupid when he was also playing with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry whom were considered the two stars of the team, and the rest of the team composed of Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, and Fred Vanvleet.   Randle would be an outstanding third option, because that‚Äôs much easier than having to be the #1 and be gameplanned against every game.   There‚Äôs a reason why Pascals efficiency dropped 10% after Kawhi left. It‚Äôs just basic common sense. #1 option= very hard. #3 option= much easier"
Get a player like Kyle Lowry or a scorer like Zach LaVine
Kyle Lowry
"Yeah Kyle Lowry, LeBron, Harden, KD, Steph rounds out the top 5 for the 2010s for sure"
"I think it makes more sense for the Knicks to give a short, high-AAV contract to Kyle Lowry and have it roll off the books in 2 years. I don't think many other teams could match the offer."

almost as much as kyle lowry next year when he becomes the quick-fix-it solution for ten different teams at once
"If the Celtics trade Smart, they better win a title within the next 2 years. He is gonna be so fucking good in the back half of his career. Kyle Lowry and Chauncey Billions vibes for sure. It's crazy how good he is when he is the 4th option. Dude gets so much undeserved shit because he keeps getting pushed into second option status because Hayward, Kyrie, Kemba, Brown keep getting injured the last few years."
This team needs a Kyle Lowry type. Oh wait..
"Man you don't know how happy I am that after *yeeeears* people finally see Kemba's value, especially in relation to Kyle Lowry."
I feel like adding a Kyle Lowry at the deadline plus having Brown healthy could have made them contenders. The East is oddly competitive this year. I feel like if Brooklyn goes through the Bucks and the 76ers they are going to beat whoever comes out of the West.
"&gt;kcp (who is made by lebron and lives off his playmaking, once again replaceable),  You people are literally insane. You just called one of our best defenders and a 41% three point shooter ‚Äúreplaceable‚Äù at the fucking trade deadline in a trade that would send him along with two rotation players for Lowry.   Replaceable with what? 6‚Äô1 Austin Rivers??  Is there a sub on this app to actually discuss basketball with people who aren‚Äôt trolls or people who flat out aren‚Äôt brain dead??  This clowns sees how injured this roster has been this year and thinks 3 rotation players are replaceable by the NBA superstar Kyle Lowry who couldn‚Äôt even help the Raptors get to a play-in game.  Am I on Punked or something??"
"Kyle Lowry is an all star. He‚Äôs absolutely more important than tht (who is a nobody and can be replaced), kcp (who is made by lebron and lives off his playmaking, once again replaceable), and bum ass Dennis Schroeder who is not only completely inconsistent and worse in every way compared to Kyle Lowry but also is trying to force the lakers hand into giving him a 20+ mil contract this offseason which would handicap them for the future.  Again if your only argument is Kyle Lowry missed the playoffs youre coping. Lowry avg 17/7/5 on 59 TS% and good defense. That is absolutely more valuable than what tht, Dennis, and kcp bring to the table."

I'm sure Kyle Lowry would mind seeing himself there
Wouldn't mind seeing Kyle Lowry there
"Who the best player Lebron had to beat in the East? 22 year old Paul George? Kyle Lowry? 20 year old Tatum? He had so many weak ass runs in the East playoffs. He never had to face a top 5 player from 2011-2018 in the east, except for Rose for 1 year."
NoT WoRtH KyLe LoWrY.
"Kyle Lowry would have looked good on the lakers.   Oh well, atleast Talen Horton Tucker is going to be a superstar."
B-b-but this subreddit told me that these guys would be too valuable in the playoffs to give up for Kyle Lowry!!!
thats why veteran proven PGs like Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry matter in these playoff runs
Kyle Lowry
fuck that. Kyle lowry was mad they traded Demar and they won a championship the next year.
He even tried to work the complaining into a trick play a few possessions ago haha  Jokic is a beast but the theatrics are a bit much.  (Yes... I know my team has Kyle Lowry on it.)
"It‚Äôs a good thing the Lakers wanted to hold onto THT instead of getting Kyle Lowry, huh?"
If they sign jimmy to a fuckpill deal like that but wouldn‚Äôt trade shit ass Tyler herro for Kyle Lowry that franchise is run by dumb old people with bad brains
"Well yes kyle lowry is 35 years old, id hope tht would be better. Like u said lakers are in win now so it makes no sense to not trade for lowry  Edit: this goof above me changed his comment to prime lowry ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ lakers fans are delusional"
This subreddit is never going to admit it but the Lakers should‚Äôve traded for Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry would've been so good for this laker squad.
Imagine not trading for kyle lowry because of THT lmaooo
"Klay Thompson  Edit: Actually I have a better one, Kyle Lowry"
You can easily move him + picks for Al Horford. You can trade for John Wall and gamble it will be better. You can probably do trades for several other players as well just depends on how many picks you want to give away. Want Kevin Love?   Personally I think Kemba and Picks for Kyle Lowry is your best move. Have the Raptors do a sign and trade for 2y/ 65 million contract with Lowry and send Kemba and 2 lottery protected firsts
"What are the chances that Don't Poke the Bear, Kyle Lowry gets with his homie Butler in South Beach?"
Same for Curry and Draymond green. Kawhi and Kyle Lowry.
If Kyle Lowry stands in the post in defense all game is he a center?
Will he age as well as Kyle Lowry?
"imagine the drama when one of the teams that signs lowry has to play another team that also signed lowry  kyle plays good defense, but can he defend... himself??"
"I guess if you say ""probably"". It's all opinion based, and I would disagree on a lot of those. Kyrie has never shown he can lead a team or be ""the guy"" on a team. But I know you said Raptors last because you want me to contest with Kyle Lowry lol, which I would take 100 times out of 100 over Kyrie (obviously biased)"
Lol Kyle Lowry was drafted by Memphis...
someone like Kyle Lowry could be good
"I don‚Äôt hate him, I actually think he‚Äôs a really intriguing player. He can absolutely be a big piece on a title contender, but this Sixers team is not one. Any team with Simmons as the primary ball handler is going nowhere against real playoff opponents. If they had traded for Kyle Lowry or something, some of these issues would‚Äôve been alleviated."
"Disagree heavily, guys like Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry are the most underrated impactful players of the last decade, Mike Conley and Jrue Holiday should be added to that group as well.   Everybody gets that LeBron is the best player without understanding *why* he's the best player. What is LeBron's best skill? It's his passing.   The players with elite basketball intelligence, which is often correlated with how good of a playmaker you are, is the most underappreciated skill in basketball. Contrary to popular belief, you can't really teach basketball IQ, that intrinsic feel for the game that playmakers like LeBron, Luka, Jokic, Trae, CP3, Harden etc. have, you kinda either have it or you don't."
"Winning talks, especially for Kyle Lowry, you should know that"
I def think the Heat would be stupid not to make a run for Kyle Lowry with how they went out  Rip Dipo tho he bet on himself and it backfired so badly
"Lol it's not rocket science man.  6 years and the best the East puts out is teams led by Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, Paul George and Roy Hibbert, or uh Paul Milsap and Al Horford.  That's really all that needs to be said."
Bet the Lakers wish they would have accepted that Kyle Lowry trade now üòÇ
?  You mean the dominant playoff run where the offense was run by Kyle Lowry? The Raptors were a fantastic team with a great coach that he slotted perfectly into. Kawhi did not have to create an offense but just get his own buckets with them. Same as his role within the Spurs.
Kyle Lowry + 4 G-leaguers  Trust me
"I gotta give Drummond props on this. He's stepping up and looking to take the charge.   People just like to shit on Drummond. They wait for a game where he has a negative +/- and then point it out, ignoring the fact that he had a positive impact the 2 or 3 games prior.   Ayton is tearing shit up, but he's playing like twice as many minutes as Drummond, so it's not like whoever is covering him the other half of the game anybody else is doing any better.   People just get this narrative about Drummond getting 20/20 and not having an impact on the game, and they think repeating this tired clich√© makes them sound like they got some analytical gem that makes them sound smart.   &amp;#x200B;  Ayton tried taking a charge here. He's not 'flopping' as so many are saying. He' taking the full weight of a 250-pound big and taking the charge like he's supposed to.   Did he get his feet still in time Maybe not. Close call. But nobody digs on Kyle Lowry when he does this.   He's trying to make the right play. He didn't get the call.   So kudos to Drummond for the effort. He's got obvious limits to his game, but he's out there trying to do his best and taking charges like I haven't seen him do during his time in Detroit."
Sad the Lakers didn't trade for Kyle Lowry. Kyle Lowry would fuck up the suns.
"Yeah. To be fair, though, a lot of that goes on Kyle Lowry. Kyle Lowry is a great playmaker. He was back in the DeMar years, and he was in the Kawhi year. Kawhi wasn‚Äôt much of a playmaker, and still isn‚Äôt, which is part of why the Clippers are struggling so much. But Siakam also isn‚Äôt the best playmaker. Overall, Lowry‚Äôs always been the glue of that team."
Exactly zero teams should have traded for Kyle Lowry the 30 million dollar free agent to be
Siakam without Lowry in 18 games  23.2/7.7/4.8 on 57% TS and a +6.9 net rating  https://www.fantasylabs.com/s/0D426DED  Siakam was actually better this year without Kyle
"Great, having a third option that‚Äôs also an allstar opens up the floor for you immensely lol. He was on a team with 2 allstars with no expectations where he could just let them lead the way.   Again, you would‚Äôve never said this 4 games ago, so chances are you shouldn‚Äôt let 4 games completely change your opinion. That‚Äôs why people say this sub is so reactionary, you would‚Äôve been laughed at before the playoffs if you said Siakam was better than Randle.   That championship run is wholly irrelevant in the conversation. Put Julius Randle on a team with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry, they‚Äôd be just as good lol"
"Okay yeah you‚Äôre right about the assists thing my b, but the point still stands that Randal has done more with less and he doesn‚Äôt have the luxury of playing with a Kyle Lowry aka another allstar"
Kyle Lowry bruh who‚Äôs Randles Lowry? Derrick Rose coming off the bench?
"Okay and Randle might make all nba this year too lol. The point is that in the regular season, Randal is far better than Siakam. You‚Äôre being very, very reactionary by suddenly Siakam is better than Randal on offense just because of one bad playoff series.   Siakam‚Äôs roster was also WAY more talented than what Randal has around him. He had Kyle Lowry FFS Randle is the only star on his team and they‚Äôre the 4th seed."
Doris just likes to talk about NBA players bodies and also thinks Kyle Lowry is a tough nut   Or maybe she meant to say he has a tough nut   Okay I‚Äôll see myself out the exit door now
Kyle Lowry would have been a difference maker. But I think Jimmy played really bad. You can‚Äôt win a series when your best player plays like that.
"No? We already had Dragic, doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôm talking Herro over Harden and Herro over Kyle Lowry, in the same season."
Imagine not trading him for Kyle Lowry lmao
"Here‚Äôs a secret: Despite my love for Luka and despite what my username may indicate,    &gt;!I am actually a Raptors fan and I love Kyle Lowry more than my future kids!&lt;"
"Probably a 3pt shooting pg that can defend and play make. So Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry really. It would open up the space for Bam And Butler and I think increase their offensive potency while retaining their defensive strengths. Sucks the only players on the market or in their mid-30s but they are top-tier just with limited years of effectiveness. Maybe Schroeder but he‚Äôs likely to stay with Lakers. CP3 is likely to stay with Phoenix too but he‚Äôs a star with huge impact, I can see him weighing his options more than Schroeder who is a great starting pg but not quite as impactful as CP3"
"Kyle Lowry. But if they can't get him, they should go after Lonzo Ball."
Not trading Tyler herro for Kyle Lowry üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"He‚Äôs about the level of Kyle Lowry. This is the first year he‚Äôs been an all star but he would have been an all star multiple times if he was in the East. You‚Äôre right he doesn‚Äôt exactly stand out which is why he‚Äôs great for the Jazz, he can take a back seat to Mitchell or lead the team when necessary, but he does have a bit of flare to his game it just doesn‚Äôt stand out. He‚Äôs similar to Stockton but a bit more flashy. He‚Äôs a terrific defender but small, he‚Äôs a solid scorer but not over the top. He‚Äôs just an overall solid point guard in a league featuring extremely talented point guards so he gets lost in the mix"
"The right move is to trade Jimmy Butler to the Warriors for Wiggins, Wiseman, Minnesota pick, Warriors pick, and then shake them down for a future Warriors pick too.  The Heat have to ask themselves, can they build a better team than the Bucks or Nets in the next 2 years? If the answer is no, then move Jimmy, because once Jimmy starts getting to around 35-years old, he will start declining.   Something being overlooked is Jimmy is going to be a free agent next year. If he has another All NBA season you can expect him to opt out and secure one last big max deal. If his teammates are still poor next year outside of Bam, he might just leave Miami and they get nothing back.   Miami doesn‚Äôt have great options to improve the roster.  Because Bam took the extension instead of waiting, they only have around $25 million in cap space, well short of Kawhi‚Äôs max which will start at $39.2 million. This creates an awkward situation when it comes to acquiring him. Moving on from him, there other move is bringing in Kyle Lowry, at 35-years old, who could fall off a cliff any year, or being in someone like Lonzo or Markannen, and hope they don‚Äôt just steal your money.  They only can trade their 2028 draft pick and Tyler Herro has lost most of his trade value. There just aren‚Äôt good opportunities to upgrade the roster significantly to get on the Bucks / Nets levels, so they should move on from Jimmy‚Äôs timeline and move to Bam‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs unfortunate because Jimmy fits well with the franchise, but it‚Äôs the right move. The Heat should celebrate the two years and retire his Jersey for the contribution to the franchise, but it‚Äôs in both parties best interests for a breakup.  As for Jimmy, the Heat wouldn‚Äôt be doing him wrong. I‚Äôm sure he will be happy to get to compete for a championship with Curry and get to play with his friends from the 2016 Olympic team."
"All the ripping on Herro is a bit much. He had a fine season that is overshadowed by the bubble run, but he‚Äôs also 21, Miami doesn‚Äôt have much wiggle room, and the Harden issue is likely complicated by Jimmy‚Äôs Jimmyness? But including Kyle Lowry in this...sorry but Lowry was not swinging that Bucks series. Bam and Jimmy were exposed a bit in needing to be surrounded by hot shooting, and the supporting cast was weaker this year. Two guys who don‚Äôt shoot from range means the margins are super thin in the playoffs- Lowry would help with that but not nearly enough to win the series"
"The fact of the matter is Tyler Herro has the potential to become a key piece to a championship team, perhaps as important as somebody like Kyle Lowry is with the Raptors! - Jack Harlow"
Idk something tells me James Harden or Kyle Lowry would have averaged more
Everyone needs to chill on the Tyler Herro slander. It was Pat Riley and the Heat FO who made the decision not to make the potential trades for James Harden and Kyle Lowry
I think the Raptors won the Kyle Lowry/Tyler Herro trade
Heat don't look like they were 1 Kyle Lowry away from contending this year. Might have just decided to retain their young players and regroup for next season rather than going all in with Lowry
"kyle lowry has nothing to do with this, hershel."
Kyle L-l-l-lowry!!!
"Most guys in the league don't win shit, especially with LeBron and KD constantly stacking the deck in their favor.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, six players have been the best player on a finals team - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Butler.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, the only players that have won shit are LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis."
"The way Trae just murdered them with the teardrop for like 5 possessions in a row, then abused the pick and roll with Collins for 3 in a row, then went back to the teardrop was giving me 2K PTSD.  It was like when you make it to the NBA but you don‚Äôt have clamps yet and Kyle Lowry is just running you down like the degenerate that you are. And you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúplease Kyle don‚Äôt do this to me, I‚Äôm right here. I‚Äôm literally right in front of you please Kyle!‚Äù  But it doesn‚Äôt matter because he‚Äôs blowing by you like you don‚Äôt exist. Post fades, layups, step back mid‚Äôs, and they‚Äôre all green. And you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúplease 2K can I just play like, a little bit of defense‚Äù But EA is like ‚Äúnot until you spend at least $50 on VC‚Äù  Anyways, Trae Young did to Brook Lopez what everyone has been saying other players do to him since he got drafted. He showed everyone who he was tonight. Legendary performance."
"Even the Raptors were a mini super team. Kawhi Leonard jumping ship and joining a playoff caliber team with Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol and Danny Green."
Sure.  I already conceded that he's not a top 30 player because the most recent version of him didn't play to that level. This sub has the memory of a goldfish and the most rudimentary understanding of the sport so I'm not going to waste my time.   Kyle Lowry on June 23rd 2021 isn't a better basketball player than Ben Simmons but there's literally nothing I can do to change your mind if you would say something so ridiculous so he's not a top 30 player
With the Raptors providing additional compensation on top of Kyle.  You don't want Lowry?
Imagine bringing up kyle lowry in a thread about the pistons LMFAO. This is like a new found mental illness
That‚Äôs fine. The Raptors already got that 1 rare chip out of all those years of waiting. That 30M of Kyle Lowry will be off the books and replaced with a rookie contract who will hopefully be Suggs.
"Either would be fine. I would be surprised if Jalen Green becomes available past 3. Nurse and his staff can work on Suggs. He definitely has the tools considering his height, speed, athleticism, and he‚Äôs at NBA weight already. I mean Kyle Lowry averaged less than 4 assists in college but he became a solid PG for the Raptors eventually. OG and Siakam were taken beyond the 20th pick and VanVleet was even undrafted. I trust the development team of the Raptors to unlock the potential of a 4th pick player."
"Kyle Lowry, Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, Steve Nash, Dennis Rodman hit his prime when he was like 50, Sam Cassell, Stockton, I'm sure there's more that's just off the top of my head. Ben is arguably better than all of those dudes were at this point in their careers. He still has upside."
"Kyle Lowry fans do, cause that‚Äôs how he plays ball"
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
"It will only happen if it‚Äôs Ben Simmons for Lowry and some other assets. As good as Kyle Lowry is, he‚Äôs 35 years old and that will mean a shorter window for the Sixers. He‚Äôs also an FA this offseason so the Sixers may not need the Raptors to get him. They could just salary dump one of their own and then sign him if they want to."
It‚Äôs also too overconfident and unrealistic for the Raptors to think that a 4th pick would be equal value for Bradley Beal and that a 24 year old Ben Simmons would be given away by the Sixers for the twilight years of Kyle Lowry.
I really hope one of Toronto‚Äôs good players gets purposefully injured on a dirty foul and knocked out right before the playoffs so y‚Äôall can experience what playing against Kyle Lowry is like.
"4 Teamer &amp; Works on Trade Machine:  Raptors:   - Porzingis - Malcolm Brogdon  Mavs:   - Myles Turner  - Rodney Hood  Pacers:  - Kemba Walker - OG Anunoby  OKC:   - Kyle Lowry - Draft Picks (Presti, duh)  Roast me if this is stupid. Thought of this in 2 min. Go Cers."
Ohhhhh. The Kyle Lowry special!!! Inbound to win the game!!! Holy shitttt
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
big booty kyle lowry
"Raptors driving Kyle Lowry to the airport ASAP, Jalen Suggs/Van YEET backcourt"
If the raptors get the number 1 pick they have to trade kyle Lowry right?
Kyle Lowry will get in......*barely*
"yet the raptors manage to make it to a conference finals with demar derozan and kyle lowry at times playing like shit before they got bounced by lebron with dwane casey of all people!  Demar Derozan scored in the single digits 3 times in that playoff run, he was in the teens multple of times, He was the best raptor on that team, he didn't play like it but they still were able to beat indy, beat milwaukee, and make it to a conference final.   Why can't doc even do that? If ben sucks in the next round, okay, I can see that. Milwaukee is a good team in the east, ben should be that player that delivers, but doc can't beat the atlanta hawks and make it to the conference final? Really? the atlanta hawks? Dwane Casey can coach with his star playing being inconsistent, but doc with his second star player that's not known as a scorer can't?   We're not asking Doc to pull off an upset, here. We're asking doc to beat the atlanta hawks. the atlanta hawks. undermanned atlanta hawks where hunter went out and bogie was not himself for 2 straight games.   I'm telling you man, we really have to look at doc as the issue. Seriously lol. The guy is a joke."
"and also I‚Äôm not trying to make it seem like Dejounte is some amazing player that is a true championship quality point guard, idk if that‚Äôs true, but at the start of the playoffs is was agreed that the Sixers had a cakewalk to the conference finals and I think that if they had pretty much any other starting point guard in the league(outside of a few) over this version of Ben Simmons who did not attempt a field goal in the 4th quarter and averaged like 11 ppg they could beat an 8th seed and 5th seed as the 1st seed. Dejounte on this team would have Philly in the ecf, so would like Malcolm Brogdan, Kyle Lowry, Collin Sexton, either Ball brother, man maybe even healthy Markelle Fultz or half healthy Kemba Walker idk Ben Simmons was just that bad"
"LOL @ Trae's ceiling being John Wall, Kyle Lowry.   Trae is a 30/10 player at 22, neither of them have come close to that. Also as of now his playoff assist per game would be good enough for #2 **all time**."
"Luka is miles better than Trae. He gets swept by Clippers  Luka is generation/GOAT ceiling. Trae is good. Thats all. Like in that John Wall, Kyle Lowry tier"
"I grew up watching the Raptors be the joke of the NBA, so winning that 2019 championship still feels surreal to me. It gave me a lot of closure, especially watching Kyle Lowry get his respect (after years of being labelled a ""trash bro"").  Everything from here on is gravy for me, the Raptors could be a lottery team for the next 5-10 years and I couldn't care less."
NBA Champion Kyle Lowry******
Beg Kyle Lowry to join
"I don't fully understand the sign-and-trade rule:   Does every team with enough cap-space (Miami, Dallas, NY,...) can sign-and-trade Kyle Lowry to the sixers or only Toronto can do that ?"
Do you guys think ben simmons gets traded to the raptors for kyle lowry? Maybe masai can get more too tbh. I feel like the raptors development team is good enough to fix ben simmons' jump shot.
"I saw this trade on Twitter and it‚Äôs low key kinda good   Wolves get: Ben Simmons  Sixers get: Beasley,Kyle Lowry,Jake Layman  Raptors get: Rubio and a first from Minnesota in 2023 and a first from Philly in 2023"
Went from being the main asset in a Harden trade to now being the main asset in a trade for CJ McChicken and Old Ass Kyle Lowry üò≠üò≠üò≠  Edit: No disrespect to Lowry that man is a baller he just old
Bruh 4 years $147M for Simmons? No one fucking wants that lol. That's so laughable.   You can get Kyle Lowry or Kawhi Leonard for that money lol. It's not just about the money it's about the alternative which is signing a top free agent who is actually good at basketball.  No one trying to pay $33-40M a year for the next four years for Simmons.
"Even by the home team there are different standards. Been mentioned elsewhere but the quality of assists for Kyle Lowry compared to FVV can be different and their assist totals are not a good indicator of their playmaking ability.   Lowry is a great playmaker, and FVV sometimes has issues with overdribbling and not involving teammates in the offense. Would not know looking at their APG which are fairly close.  Some of these ones are absurd though. Like what on earth is #13?"
remember that game Lowry called him into the tunnel in philly?  kyle knew ben was a punk lmao
There was one singular game Kyle Lowry out scored Kawhi in that finals series. We also won‚Äôt talk about game 1 when he had like 5 points.
Kyle Lowry.
That Kyle Lowry guy is ok at the pick and roll
"Hol up this is what I thought of  Wolves recieve: Ben Simmons  Sixers recieve: Malik Beasley and Kyle Lowry via sign and trade  Raptors recieve: Rubio,Culver and Wolves 2023 first"
Bro Champion Kyle Lowry was known as one of the biggest playoff chokers in the league until like his 15th season lol
3-team trade  Simmons to Portland McCollum to Toronto Kyle Lowry to Philly  Plus whatever throw-ins are needed to make the contracts line up.
1 year of Kyle Lowry could do wonders for Embiid career compared to a lifetime of Ben Simmons.
"kyle lowry, no irony intended"
"Daryl Morey has also been shit since 2019. He gave a massive overpay for Russ,Traded Capela and a draft pick for Covington then in Philly the Seth Curry trade was good but he ultimately was not willing to give up the Farm for Harden and then decided George Hill was the better option than Kyle Lowry"
"*Even* Kyle Lowry? He was and probably still is the best available piece to fit in with that team. Imagine being Morey and balking at trading Maxey, Thybulle, and a couple of low picks for a trip to the ECF at minimum"
Literally can't think of a better fit for what the 76ers needed than Kyle Lowry. He was the leader of a championship team too ffs
idk dude. Kyle Lowry &amp; Marcus Smart go toe to toe with Draymond in that department I believe.
"Like just imagine even Kyle Lowry in Ben Simmons place. Even if he's not at his peak he'll space the floor, set mean screens, and still be a pest defensively"
"I guess the argument could be that they already had their main distributor in Simmons, making Lowry an expensive third option if the asking price of Thybulle + a young player was accurate, which I guess makes sense, but we all know Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up shooter."
no no. They passed up on trading for Lowry for draft assets and a couple young players at best. Now their options are to trade Simmons (who was never in the Lowry trade talks) for CJ who I'm not sure is actually better than Kyle lol
"Can still develop a shot, took Kyle Lowry a few years in the league to step up. But never a question about spark off the bench/defensive intensity. Fresh start might be what he needs."
Sign and Trade Kyle Lowry back home and we'll take big Ben up here in Canada please.
"Kyle Lowry fits next to any player, that's part of his appeal. He's a point guard who can play as a SG for another PG (FVV; Delon Wright; Cory Joseph) or be a floor spacer for a scorer (Kawhi; Derozan), or he can be a great playmaker/floor general to get his teams easy baskets for his bigs off PNR (Ibaka; JV; Biyombo) or shooters (Powell; OG). He does this without being exposed on defense and regularly switches on bigs and holds his ground. I can't understate Lowry's versatility despite being a 6'0 PG. He's always played 2 roles for this team, carry our bench lineups as the main offensive player/scorer, and than play a more secondary playmaker role once we have our starters in."
"In my mind I was thinking why not keep jimmy and trade Simmons for someone who can shoot. But at that time it seemed like a far fetched idea to give up Simmons so early.   But looking at it now, it was the perfect time to do that when his trade value was at its highest.   They legit could have got Kyle Lowry plus OG, or Bradley Beal, or even Harden or CP3 or so many other options which are al much better than Simmons."
Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry absolutely under no circumstance belong with the others here lol. Both are incredibly valuable and impact winning
Bruh the Lakers weren't a kyle Lowry away from a championship lmao. Raptors fans been real annoying with this shit recently
&gt;I think Ben can still easily be an all star. He just should have never been a PG. ~~George Hill~~ Kyle Lowry should have been the ball handler.
"Yea, trade for guys constantly losing in the 1st or 2nd round. Instead of CHAMPION Kyle lowry"
kyle lowry
"The stupid part about this is that CJ for Simmons isn‚Äôt going to cost anything that would have been sent in the Lowry trade, and CJ Kyle Embiid would be disgusting offensively."
Are you suggesting that a Kyle Lowry-type could have been instrumental in getting this Philly team to the Finals?
"Sure, but I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I could think of a more perfect player for the sixers this year than Kyle Lowry. Maybe a healthy Chris Paul.   Kyle Lowry with a big like Embiid‚Ä¶ oh my god that would unfair."
"I still remember trade deadline day when sixers fans were telling me they got George Hill, who they claimed is arguably just as good as Lowry, for way cheaper and they‚Äôre glad they didn‚Äôt Kyle.  Oh how the turn tables."
Raptors receive - Ben Simmons   76ers receive - Kyle Lowry  Simmons +FvV + OG + Siakam?  That‚Äôs a defensive powerhouse.
‚ÄúKyle Lowry on a budget‚Äù
"&gt; He has justification due to Masai and his ridiculous demands from not only Philly but with the Lakers and Miami as well. In Masai‚Äôs mind Lowry was more valuable than James harden.  How were the demands ridiculous? He set the asking price and didn't move to low ball offers. For a team like Philly, a Kyle Lowry this season is possibly the difference between a championship or not. It's not just about what Kyle was in a vacuum, which is still a lot for a championship pedigree PG who lifts the whole floor of your team, but what his value would have been the Sixers.   Don't know where you got that he was more valuable than Harden. Clearly the Sixers didn't have enough to trade for Harden, so even if Masai came with the same offer for Kyle, it would be ""clearly it wasn't enough for Harden, but would it be enough for Kyle?"" If he asked for more than Houston was asking for Harden, then I'd say it's him valuing Lowry more than Harden."
Kyle Lowry: Friendly fire enabled.
"Yes Kyle Lowry was the reason the Lakers got eliminated, not injuries or anything like that"
"Kyle Lowry, Andrea Iguodala without the offense"
Luka is a top 5 player ever. Trae is just an ugly Kyle Lowry
76ers should have gotten Kyle lowry when they could!
Doc has to take the blame as the head coach for what happened. He has been doing this shit for the last 13 years and the right question is whether Doc can even make it to the NBA finals again. Everyone enjoys knocking down on Ben but he is better suited at the 4 and was changed to a point guard. The 76ers FO and the coaching staff have to take some of the blame here. Also having a Kyle Lowry at point guard would have been the difference maker as well.
embiid + kyle lowry would probably have been a championship duo this season.
Simmons for Kyle Lowry s&amp;t
Get Sixers Kyle Lowry at PG then
"Sign and trade for Kyle Lowry, trade Ben for CJ, roll out an Embiid, Harris, McCollum, Lowry starting five plus somebody (Danny Green?). With that backcourt honestly Seth Curry needs to go, he is just too bad defensively and you can get something decent for him."
"idk about that, maxey and thybulle are very promising talents who need to play more. Kyle Lowry is freaking 35 years old, if anything if they traded simmons for lowry straight up they would be in the conference finals."
Kyle Lowry probably wasn‚Äôt changing anything for those teams
Ok you obviously didn‚Äôt read my comment just like everyone else downvoting me.  I‚Äôm not saying Kyle Lowry hasn‚Äôt been a better player than Reggie I‚Äôm saying right now in a vacuum Reggies performance this playoffs has been better than Kyle Lowrys performance this year.
"Is it really? Harris is decent but on a terrible contract. Shake and Maxey are fine, but neither are great. Each had one good game coming off the bench to create a spark but that's it. Dwight was not good and got killed by a rookie.  Curry is the only dude that is really a consistent positive player and he was cooked for 27 by Huerter. Maybe Lowry is the piece they need, but I doubt 36 year old Kyle Lowry will be enough, but who knows"
Biggest win win facilitating Kyle Lowry to Sixers
Is Kyle Lowry making a new fragrance?
"Kyle Lowry. Not a Sixers fan, but if I was, I'd rather have Fat Kyle Lowry"
"Kyle Lowry is the guy they need. A tough defender who can shoot, playmake and has experience to provide leadership."
Nothing official but they wouldn't package Maxey and Thybulle  for Kyle Lowry or picks was the rumor.   edit: what we know for sure is they discussed a trade and it didn't follow through what the specifics were we dont know.
"The raptors sub has been pretty smug with ‚Äúthe asking price for Kyle Lowry is way too high‚Äù from the lakers, heat, and the philly fans."
"Kyle Lowry is a very good player who has started, played big minutes, and hit big shots for a championship team and these teams‚Äô fan bases didn‚Äôt want to give up a 20mpg player + a bad first rounder for him. It was hilarious."
Lowry and Embiid PnR would be unstoppable. I hope Kyle stays in Toronto tho
"So tired of this Kyle Lowry trade lol. We would lose Kcp Shroder THT and picks for a year of 35yrs old Kyle Lowry. And if AD was still injured, we still had no chance for the chip.  We would be trading all our assets for an absolute horror and then we are forced to retain a 36yrs old Lowry because we have 0 assets left."
"Nope injuries and getting carried by Kawhi did  Kyle Lowry averaged like 12ppg on 39% shooting vs Philly and got bailed out by Kawhi   This Philly team is not a Kyle Lowry away from a ring, they are not that good"
we are being annoying because Kyle Lowry would have most probably helped Philly win the championship given the injury situation this year. Ask Celtics fans how good Kyle Lowry was against them when he essentially single handedly carried a severely underperforming Siakam to a game 7 against the Celtics
"I'm sure they do, this Philly team needs way more than an old ass Kyle Lowry to win one  Last playoffs Lowry played he shot below 40% from the field and 33% from three, a serial playoff choker bailed out by Kawhi"
Imagine what the Sixers would have done if they made the trade for Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶ Lakers too for that matter.
The cap space that would free up with that trade would allow the Sixers to sign somebody like Kyle Lowry in free agency.   Addition by subtraction
Kyle Lowry sign &amp; trade.
Most important stat for the Sixers were 0-1 Kyle Lowry trades executed.
"Speaking of Raptors championship players, Sixers unironically win this series if they trade for Kyle Lowry."
Or passing on Kyle Lowry when they had the chance to get him and not give up any of their stars.
"Imagine if the 76ers had a proper PG like say, Kyle Lowry."
"Sorry but keeping Thytrash and Maxcrap over Kyle Lowry makes no sense at all.  You can't be on the fence about competing for a chip, this year the 76ers had a very good chance and Lowry could've put them over the top."
What round did Kyle Lowry make it to?
Kyle Lowry cuz my kids can get close up pics of the dumpy
Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry
"&gt;VC played his prime years for the Raptors and signed a 6 year extension when his rookie contract was up.  And then he demanded a trade to get out of there. Vince Carter: **Forced his way out of Toronto.**   &gt;He wasn't even a star yet when he left, he was growing into one. He's even admitted after his career that this was the wrong move, looking back he wouldn't stayed with Vince in Toronto.  And yet the fact remains: He was a budding star, and **left Toronto**.   &gt;Bosh also signed an extension with Toronto and played 7 of his best years here. He was a star, but definitely wasn't a superstar player. I would put both DeMar and Kyle on the same level and they also both played here for 8-10 years each by choice.  LMAO now this is some revisionist bullshit. Bosh on the same level with Lowry and DeMar, HAHAHA. Literally the only reason Bosh wasn't perennial All-NBA second team at least is cus he played in Toronto on bum teams. When he signed with Miami it was a huge deal precisely because it was 3 superstars joining forces together. Bosh was a superstar and he **left Toronto**.  Just like Kawhi **left Toronto**.   Four superstars, and all **left Toronto.**  You just hate to see it. Especially since Our guy stayed‚Ñ¢"
"In no realm does a 37 year old LeBron, Anthony Davis, and 36 year old Kyle Lowry take on Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin Durant all in their primes. The offensive power is just too great, Lakers can‚Äôt match their shooting"
"&gt;Its such a weak free agency   Not when it comes to point guards it's not, especially ones who are at least on Schroder's level. There's only a few teams that have $20 million in cap space to make him a lucrative offer, and Schroder will be competing for that money with Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, and Patty Mills. Hell, if some team with a lot of space wanted to they could very easily trade for Kemba Walker and get a better PG than Schroder. If Schroder was hands down the best PG available, then sure, one team might throw a ton of money at him just as BPA, but that's clearly not the case this year."
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
"Most people would say no. The better fit at PG on paper would be a Kyle Lowry because of his ability to space the floor and shoot the 3.  I however would argue that the Lakers aren‚Äôt as desperate for ‚Äúshooting‚Äù as they are for offensive playmaking outside of LeBron, easy transition points, and rebounding. All of which Westbrook brings in spades.  I don‚Äôt care what the fit is honestly. If you can bring in a player like Westbrook for what presumably would be some package of Schroder, Kuzma, and 1st/2nd round picks you do it.  AD wants to play on the perimeter all the time anyway now so you can have plenty of spacing if need be."
Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt a star point guard man üòÇ he only won that ring because of kawhi and the warriors being hurt and lebron is not looking to run the offense all the time anymore he‚Äôs getting old they need a playmaker and a guy that‚Äôs going to give you offense and that‚Äôs Russ and honestly if you seen how dwade and lebron  it would be same style of play with Russ and lebron dwade wasn‚Äôt a good 3 point shooter but he was a great slasher/mid range passer same as Russ and they ran a good fast break offense and Russ can run off ball plays to the hoop bron still is going to run the show but it‚Äôs good when have another elite playmaker and ball handler on the squad and your talking about giving up role players but did any of those guys actually do something in the playoffs after AD got hurt no all three didn‚Äôt do shit so their not good role players
"In your situation, you could execute a double sign and trade, but it‚Äôs under the condition that each player involved is under contract with their 2020 team. So, Kyle Lowry would have to execute the trade as a member of the Raptors. Same with Collins and Atlanta. See KD/D-Lo trade, which was not a 1-for-1 as your OP suggests.    Both teams would have to adhere to a hard cap, as receiving teams of a S&amp;T player."
I don't agree with your defense comment because if you replace Kyle with Ben then you find yourself in a situation where thybulle can play extended minutes since spacing is suddenly a lot better.   Lowry is also an incredible defender. Bit as versatile as Ben but I watched that entire series and I still stand by my comment.
"Yeah they shot horrible from 3 in the playoffs, but they had shooters that the other teams couldn‚Äôt just leave wide open. Russ playing off-ball when Lebron is running the offense will not have a defender within 10 feet of him. There is a difference between his level of shooting and whomstever you would say was the worst Bucks rotation player.   Yes what Russ is doing is valuable in the regular season but my entire point is that if you want to build the best Championship Contender around LeBron and AD, Russ is not the best use of resources considering you‚Äôre also going to have give up playoff rotation players to get him.   A Lakers team in the late round of the playoffs would have Lebron and AD spamming pick and rolls with space 90% of the time. Wasting offensive possession with Russ running the show ain‚Äôt it.   If you think you need a star PG to play with LeBron, Kyle Lowry makes a lot more sense."
"&gt; If you just replace Ben Simmons with Kyle Lowry  this line of thinking is so incredibly dumb it literally makes my brain throb...replacing Simmons with Lowry affects so much of the game that they would have completely different outcomes. For a start, you don't get Ben's elite defensive ability. This is important because Trae absolutely torched Green for 25 points in the first half of game one, Doc then put Ben on him and he only scored 10 more points. For the rest of the series he shot 37%. That in itself changes everything. Lowry's decision making changes so many things. There's an infinite number of possibilities that could lead to an infinite number of outcomes simply by swapping one player with another. To suggest that 'Simmons missed a bunch of free throws that Lowry would have made' is just, again, incredibly dumb."
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/ the sticking point of the trade was whether or not lakers would give THT
Raptors will help Lowry as long as it doesn't hurt the Raptors future. Taking on mediocre players that fill our cap space is something I don't see us doing. If Kyle wants to sign with the Heat or Knicks outright then it's still a win for us
I‚Äôd like to see a Kyle Lowry sign and trade along with Pascal Siakim for a package from the Sixers centered around Ben Simmons
"Why is it the consensus among fans that the Raptors should be looking to trade their ‚Äúaging‚Äù core players for younger talent/draft picks? I‚Äôve heard trade ideas for Siakam, FVV, Boucher, all of whom were part of their championship roster 2 years ago. Just doesn‚Äôt entirely make sense to sell the farm, especially when these players all have chemistry and aren‚Äôt even that old. This isn‚Äôt Kyle Lowry or Marc Gasol we‚Äôre talking about lol, i don‚Äôt get it."
"Kyle Lowry was the 2nd best player. Siakam was the 2nd scoring option.   Also, it's way too early to give up on Wiseman. Centers usually take a while to get good, look at Ayton. It was also a weird year and he barely played his 1 season in college.  FWIW I don't think the Raptors should blow it up. They need to add some talent though"
This could actually be good for the raptors and 76ers if they do this right. I think that maybe I can't remember if Kyle Lowrys contract had ran out possibly trade him or Fred vanvleet with picks since the 76ers are contending they would have a player with championship experience that fits there team like Lowry. The reason it would be good for the raptors is because they are rebuilding so they could rebuild around siakam and Simmons and make a system where Simmons actually fits and can be used to his full potential.
"He‚Äôs still mad that no matter how loud Kyle Lowry cried in bubble ball, his team still lost to a pretty injured Celtics team and then proceeded to fold this year. He can enjoy the lotto lol what a joke."
Kyle Lowry Game 6 against the Celtics in 2020 ECSF
"A 6'4 Kyle Lowry type of player would be amazing. Now that I think about, a 6'4 Kyle Lowry is sorta like Jrue Holiday"
"Yeah, no, zero chance we take a bad deal for us just for the sake of helping Lowry. This offseason is probably our only chance for years of getting a free agent, and crippling the franchise for years just so Kyle ends up on the team he wants to is not an option."
"If you just replace Ben Simmons with Kyle Lowry, the 6ers beat the hawks in 5 games in last year's playoffs."
"Even if Lakers only get Lowry that would be huge. Kyle Lowry is exactly what Lebron looks for in a player. Doesn‚Äôt take a lot of shots, but efficient and on top of that has a ring with a ton of playoff experience. He‚Äôd compliment them so well."
"it doesn't matter. you have no leverage. free agent 36 year old kyle lowry is not worth a DPOY player straight up, sorry"
kyle lowry is a free agent lmao
Even though Kyle Lowry is obviously a way better player than Ben Simmons
"Well hopefully some other team agrees. Because my impression is that even all-star level players decline very quickly in the 35+ age range, and we did not come close enough as a team to all in on Kyle Lowry"
"Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), OG Anunoby and the 4th pick (Jalen Suggs) ought to get this done."
Do you think Suggs will be that guy? üëÄ he‚Äôs such a perfect fit for y‚Äôall but also I feel like his ceiling is Kyle Lowry which isn‚Äôt really a 1a type of player
Kyle Lowry played with Dikembe Mutumbo
"1. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both go to the Lakers 2. Chris Paul wants to go to the Lakers only to be turned down because of the salary cap issue and stays with the Suns instead 3. Lillard doesn't stay in Portland, but gets surprisingly traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown 4. Spencer Dinwiddle goes to the Clippers 5. The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the OKC thunder in exchange for Kemba and 2 first round picks and flip Tobias and those picks to the Blazers for CJ McCollum, Simons and Covington 6. Lonzo goes to the Bulls 7. Kawhi Leonard stays with the Clippers"
I hear there's a guy by the name of Kyle Lowry who's a free agent this year. Lowry/CJ/Thybulle/Harris/Embiid is a lineup.
"People just wanna shit on Kuz cause he‚Äôs a Laker but Kyle Lowry is a 35 year old PG coming to the end of his career. Kuz has shown his potential and just needs a different team and a bigger role to grow like any young player. We can put together a package good enough for Lowry, especially if Masai wants to ‚Äúdo right‚Äù by him."
"this is stupid, CP3 was the best player in suns during the regular season.  kyle lowry isn't even the clear cut if not the best player on his lottery team this season"
CP3 was a top 5 mvp candidate this year an all/nba  CP3 &gt; Kyle Lowry
"Agreed, Kyle Lowry is nowhere to be found.  Invalid list by default."
kyle lowry comes to la and he gets more sponsorship deals than booker who was just in the finals.
I'll take that bait  kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
Kyle Lowry seems like a good teammate
But then they wouldn't be getting Lowry. Basically saying Kyle Lowry on a new contract is worth the difference between pick #10 and whatever future pick you had in mind.
Rumors of DeMar and Kyle Lowry to the Lakers. Kuz might be headed to San Antonio which would be a great opportunity to show us what hes made of
DeMar DeRozan for Kyle Lowry
This is such pie the in the sky nonsense. No team is giving Schroeder that salary just so the lakers can get Kyle Lowry lol
"Morey ain't lookin too hot these days   I think everyone at this point knows he leaks everything, why would a GM even work with the dude. Like that Pacers package.   Let him keep Ben and try to convince everyone (including himself) that he'll have a resurgent career.   Just saying, this is the guy that said George Hill is as good as Kyle Lowry lmaoooo"
"I think it's obvious Lakers would have to acquire both guys via sign-and-trades.  Move Kuzma package to Spurs for DeMar  Move THT package to Raptors for Lowry  A lot of extra moving parts there - will Pop ever sign off on a trade to help the Lakers (apparently the Spurs have had interest in Kuzma in the past)? Can the Raptors flip the rest of the THT package (KCP contract, etc.) for a younger asset?  My feeling from the Raptors side is that Lowry goes to Masai/Bobby and says he wants to go to the Lakers, then Kyle will be a Laker."
"Okay, I'm deceased  Kyle Lowry  Demar Derozan  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Marc Gasol   Toronto duo gets their ring together with the man that blockaded them from Playoff success for half a decade..   sad nut"
Gonna be a new Air Gumbo in New Orleans when Kyle Lowry has his first dunk since 2008 next yr
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let‚Äôs see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He‚Äôs averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he‚Äôs not super-efficient, his numbers don‚Äôt contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren‚Äôt great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don‚Äôt hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year‚Äôs trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that‚Äôs it. He can‚Äôt pass the ball at a high level and he‚Äôs a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De‚ÄôAaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De‚ÄôAaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he‚Äôs on a team that hasn‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2006 and isn‚Äôt exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He‚Äôs not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you‚Äôre the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn‚Äôt going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven‚Äôt made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn‚Äôt have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn‚Äôt go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am completely off the ‚ÄúBen Simmons has superstar potential‚Äù bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It‚Äôs been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he‚Äôs going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it‚Äôs not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He‚Äôs their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He‚Äôs a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton‚Äôs contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6‚Äô1‚Äù shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it‚Äôs not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks‚Äô title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that he wasn‚Äôt the most deserving candidate. He‚Äôs a great player don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can‚Äôt help but wonder if that Jazz would‚Äôve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he‚Äôs consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I‚Äôd believe DeRozan‚Äôs role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he‚Äôs still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he‚Äôd be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn‚Äôt able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He‚Äôs going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he‚Äôs still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn‚Äôt play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year‚Äôs draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga‚Äôs Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we‚Äôre already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
Kyle Lowry will be the Jrue Holiday replacement
"Yes, it took Kyle Lowry time to ramp up. And yet the worst season of Kyle Lowry‚Äôs career has better efficiency and advanced stats than the best season of Markelle Fultz‚Äôs."
I really want Kyle Lowry too
Said everybody about Khris Middleton this year or Kyle Lowry in 2019 or Jason Terry in 2011... I could go on and on.
https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lowryky01.html  That's the page for Kyle Lowry.  Markelle's slow development is not remotely close to unprecedented.
Kyle Lowry.
Part of that is because Kyle Lowry is a charge taking savant. Probably his best skill.
Pascal and Kyle Lowry both have a good claim at being the number 2. Kyle was a great floor general for that team.
"No. Suns were a better team, more well rounded, and CP3 is much better than Kyle Lowry (who is also very good still, don‚Äôt get me wrong)."
Come home to america kyle lowry
"According to where? Why don't you link something because that's news to me. Hes more like cp3 is now where its more a leadership/aura type deal that raises the level of their teammates than actual skills. Like kyle lowry as well, thats not enough to make you top 10 theres too many superstars"
"There wasn‚Äôt much of a sellers market though. We couldn‚Äôt even get a deal for Kyle Lowry done, and Oubre is a lot worse."
"They probably getting Suggs, whose comparison is Kyle Lowry, why would they blow it up?"
"This is not a great season for free agency.   &gt; Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, John Collins and Spencer Dinwiddie are among the most compelling names to monitor"
"I can't give Chris Paul all that credit. He had a great season and definitely deserved to finish in the 4-7 range in MVP voting, but we're basically nullifying all the other factors involved.  The Suns core was naturally going to progress to a playoff spot, and I think it's fair to say that the only reason they even made the Finals (for the first time in 30 years) is because every other title contending team in the West (Lakers, Clippers, Nuggets, Jazz) had serious injuries to their #1 or #2 option. I hate to discredit the Suns but I think it's disingenuous to claim this was CP3's best season ever and that he carried the Suns to the Finals.  If they had traded for a point guard in the next caliber down (e.g. Mike Conley or Kyle Lowry) instead of Chris Paul, assuming everything else is the same, do they make the Finals? I'm not sure."
bull shit on all 29 teams trying to win every year.   even your raptors amazingly lost your last 8 games with Lowry out for rest as they tried to improve draft status.    https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1113164/kyle-lowry  try to lose = playing young guys instead of overpaying for shitty vets who are willing to suit it up and play half ass for a few months on a shitty team.      anyone who has ever held a protected pick will have stories on how that team lost just enough games to keep it from conveying.  other than OKC and they were probably trying to lose by giving Muscala crunch time shots and they just went in.
it sucks but idk if he has it in him to have a leaderly championship as you say; I see him as a Kyle Lowry to someone else‚Äôs Kawhi  his contract is also pretty huge which makes it hard for him to get traded to an upper echelon team
I doubt it. But that‚Äôs exactly what I said about Kyle Lowry so‚Ä¶.
Luke Doncic Kyle Lowry and Michael Jordan I know Jordan's retired but he owns the team so still in the nba and he could beat anyone rn still he's the goat so yeah thats my 3 for sure
"I've talked about Kyle Lowry enough to know that if Bucks fans say Giannis is the greatest Buck of all time, then he's the greatest Buck of all time."
Maybe if you narrow it down to the exact minutes of the game that Kyle Lowry was playing so well you'd have an even better argument.
I'd love to see CP3 have a quarter as good as Kyle Lowry in Game 6 of the 2019 Finals
"I like how you had to go back and pull from historical players to bash Chris Paul, and also Kyle Lowry for some reason?"
Imagine turning down a Kyle Lowry trade and instead trading for Westbrook as a third option for the same package.
"Kyrie wasn't too shabby he is 6'2""    fvv and kyle lowry were pretty good too    These guys maybe not the best player but definitely key contributors."
"Let's face it though, players are more likely to want to go team up with DBook and Ayton in a place with mild winters than Kyle Lowry, FVV and Spicy P in a city that barely cracks freezing most of the season."
I‚Äôll always respect Serge Ibaka when during the presentation he ensured that Kyle Lowry was the first to lift the trophy over his head. It was a great moment that the whole team celebrated collectively.
"He led a team to the playoff as a young player. I dont even put that in the category of a playoff choker.  Giannis wasnt a Kyle Lowry, its what made Lowrys playoff run ^^^^^with_kawhi   sweeter"
Kyle Lowry got it first when Toronto won and it was just right.
Kyle Lowry got it first when the Raptors won.
"Bucks can run it back, just make sure Jrue is more constant instead of going cold, if he cant do that trade him for some role players and try and sign kyle lowry."
Kyle Lowry lifted the trophy first in 2019.
kyle lowry
Kyle Lowry played thru most of 2019 playoffs with torn ligament in thumb and still had no problem splashing 3s and shitting on Gsw in 1st Q of game 6
Biased as hell but I‚Äôm rocking with the big booty king. Fans in the US don‚Äôt understand how beloved Kyle Lowry is in the country of Canada
"Boo freakin hoo, Kyle Lowry was playing with a broken thumb in the 2019 Finals. As everyone likes to say, if you're on the court there's no excuses."
I'm not sure how this is a question without the obvious answer of Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry has a ring and will be better remembered
"we had a report literally a day ago that the Pels are in on Kyle Lowry, now a report the Pels want to start Kira at pg, tomorrow it'll be a report that maybe Lonzo stays put, then he'll be out again and they'll plug another guard."
Deron Williams game with Kyle lowrys accomplishments lol. Seriously tho probably Lowry. But man being able to  pull off that double crossovers on dudes like dwill did would be pretty cool ass well
kyle lowry he has too much leadership
Anyone who watched Deron Williams play in the 2018 finals would rather have a career like Kyle Lowry
"He doesn‚Äôt get more respect though. Nobody gives a fuck about Deron Williams, I‚Äôm sure Jazz fans don‚Äôt, and Nets fans definitely don‚Äôt. Kyle Lowry is synonymous with an NBA franchise unlike Deron and will always be a certified Toronto legend and have a second home here. He also is a champion.   Kyle Lowry 7 days a week."
I don't need to be Kyle Lowry to have a big butt
Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry
"People don't respect defense enough to rate him like that, sadly.  Also he's a much better defender than Lowry. Kyle Lowry was more ""hit or miss, but his playmaking and overall court leadership was there every game"".  Jrue is literally just fucking up superstar guards with his defense."
kyle lowry
"Nah, they were ""The Trash Bros"" . Bros, together,  2 of them.   Here you go:  [http://www.insidehoops.com/forum/showthread.php?405480-Lowry-and-DeRozan-The-Trash-Brothers](http://www.insidehoops.com/forum/showthread.php?405480-Lowry-and-DeRozan-The-Trash-Brothers)  Here's a Lowry specific thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/65q512/kyle\_lowry\_a\_playoffs\_noshow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/65q512/kyle_lowry_a_playoffs_noshow/)  &amp;#x200B;  If you can't tell,I'm just giving Reddit shit for being the narrative love/statistics hating people that they are. I don't actually think playoff performances are particularly meaningful as predictive properties. There's virtually no evidence that there are players who consistantly out-perform their regular season numbers, more so than what  you'd see from a normal regression analysis. (Don't mean 'no' players, but it's rare and only slightly above what we'd find from normal variation)"
"Lol how did you interpret that as me treating Pau like Ariza? My point is players, regardless of how good they, are still dependent on the players around them. If Pau stayed in Memphis he would have never won a ring. You don‚Äôt have to be a HOFer to be the number 2 on a champion team (Kyle Lowry) so saying a guy is a HOFer just because he won a championship is stupid. Not to mention it implies that guys who have never won like Barkley, Stockton, and Malone, weren‚Äôt good enough to win.   We should assess players on their production and how great they were at their peak. Not give them credit for team awards. Pau is a 6x all star and 2x all NBA player. He‚Äôs borderline"
"Something something, Kyle Lowry"
he hasn't really fallen that far its mostly idiots on social media that said the same stupid shit about Kyle Lowry Paul George Chris Paul and now Simmons. Casual fans are dumb.
Only white players (or occasional Asian like Jeremy Lin) ever get the ‚Äúsneaky athletic‚Äù description.  Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry should be described as sneaky athletic as well.  Suns in 4.
Kyle Lowry only made the third-team once in his career when he was 31. Not exactly mid-30s.  CP3 has made it 10 times with as recent as the last 2 years.
So who was the #1 star in TOR? Don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs Kyle Lowry
"I mean, does Kyle Lowry not exist lol?"
"Gasol still had title aspirations in his last year here, as well as when he joined the Lakers.. he‚Äôs simply washed and shell of himself physically.   Lowry is still playing at a very high level, and he doesn‚Äôt cross me as the type to just let himself go. Neither does Marc though, like I said, he‚Äôs just cooked.   I think the little injuries will catch up to Kyle as you mentioned, I just don‚Äôt think his drop off will be comparable to Marc‚Äôs."
Dennis Jones Jr and Kyle Lowry
I could be wrong but possibly Kyle Lowry? He's gonna be 35 or 36 next year and I can't imagine that he can keep up this level of defense forever
Jrue Holiday (already is tbh)  LeBron James  Damian Lillard  Nikola Vucevic  Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry might regress to Kyle Lowest
Kyle Lowry maybe
"Def not Demar or Ingram, your defense would have crazy holes. That true pg would have to be Kyle Lowry level for you to be contenders."
"It'd be nice to have Kyle Lowry because he's a great player but they don't ""need"" a point guard to contend. They can just re-sign Beverley and still be championship contenders."
Yeah they do. They need Kyle Lowry. Rondo was brought to fill the void and he was unplayable. Beverly is not good on offense and playmaking doesn‚Äôt come naturally to Kawhi and to a lesser extent PG.
Not to dox myself but a Close older friend of mine went to temple played against Kyle Lowry in Philly all through HS and they remained close. He asked kyle how was kawhi after the trade. He said he doesn‚Äôt talk all he does it work out and smoke. So yes i agree he probably was.
"Ehh - Ben has always been a bit light in the shorts; basically the opposite of Kyle Lowry.  On the bright side, that's also why he's able to be one of the fastest players in the league at 6'10, and why he's able to guard PGs.    OG weighed over 230 at 6'6 when he was drafted; Simmons was lighter than OG and 4 inches taller.  That said, OG's wingspan was over 7'2, and Simmons was 6'11, and OG had a tiny lead in standing reach.    I'll take OG on bigs and off-ball, but it's still probably Simmons overall.    That said, you guys destroyed every iota of confidence I had in valuing perimeter defense when Trae &amp; Sweet Lou won a playoff game playing the entire 4th quarter."
Kyle Lowry?
"Kyle Lowry nor FVV would play as pathetic as Holiday, raps in 4"
Kyle Lowry looks like ‚Äòwhere my booty smack‚Äô typa dude if I‚Äôm being honest
If Kyle Lowry hits the buzzer beater 3 in game 5 2019 finals. I‚Äôd have died and gone to heaven
This is the first finals in 10 years that didn't have LeBron James or Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry was available /shrug
Kyle Lowry game 6
"Good stuff.  One thing I really like about Smart at the point that you didn't mention is it lowers the number of times Smart is setting up at the 3-point line.  He's just good enough to not be awful, but the Celtics are still definitely better when Smart is shooting less.  Yet when he's playing next to Kemba or Kyrie or whomever at the point, Smart often finds the ball passed to him at the 3-point line and is prone to hoist up poor shots.  That becomes way less of a problem when he's running the point, as he's ideally not going to get the ball back much once he's distributed it.  The end result is those 6-7 3-pointers a game that Smart takes should really be dropping down below 5 and those extra 3's are going to much better shooters like Tatum, Jaylen, or Fournier.  A second point in favor of point Smart - he's still only 27 next season and will have a new coach for the first time in his NBA career.  It's really not unreasonable for Smart to pick up a few new things this offseason, particularly if the team is all-in on him as the PG.  Steve Nash, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry... lots of really good PG's who didn't start putting it all together until around 27.  It's a tough position.     Bottom line - I think we more or less know what Smart's floor looks like as a more full-time PG, but he still has some pretty high upside and thus a very cloudy ceiling.  Either way it's low risk - Tatum will be running the show quite a bit, and with Jaylen and probably Fournier, the team will always have a couple of other guys who can handle the ball."
"Yea Grant is great, but he's not Kyle Lowry from your DD example. Vince and PG will have top 50 arguments too, Jimmy is at the very least top 100 as well. IMO the stats speak for themselves on Pippen. A 20ppg scorer back when that was still impressive who can dish out assists and rebound while being an alltime great defender. Nobody here is arguing you can win a championship with him as your best player without a completely stacked supporting cast, but none of those guys I mentioned could either."
They get Kyle Lowry and upgrade their wings
"&gt; It‚Äôs not brutal when comparing it to league average. Isn‚Äôt Kyle Lowry the best rap of all time, multi time all star, leader? What‚Äôs he doing just below league average?  He had a drop off from his regular season. Like I said before and agreed with. Which I didn't deny. I am saying it is wrong to call it brutal. Drop offs from the regular season to playoffs aren't something that only happen to Lowry, and they are more common for small guards. Are all Pacers fan this delusional or something? Or are yall just dumb.  &gt; Lol these guys will say anything to defend A rap.  If saying 0.6% below league average true shooting isn't brutal and that Lowry does have drop offs from his regular season into the playoffs is defending a Raptor, then whatever. But it ain't. I literally agreed with you about his drop off.  &gt; Just today you had OG as the second coming of Kawhi. Lmao L that  What's funny is, we didn't call OG the next Kawhi one of his player comparisons going into the draft was actually Kawhi Leonard. You know, before he ever was drafted by the Raptors. You know, by American draft scouts like Draft Express and American media like ESPN. So hold another L my guy."

"&gt; I don‚Äôt know man. The raw numbers drop off, shooting percentages drop off. They are not good. Didn‚Äôt go he scoreless even just last year against the magic one game?  Went scoreless but still came with 7 rebounds, 8 assists, two steals and was the only Raptors starter to have a positive +/- that game with a +11. Even when Lowry goes 0/7 the Raptors are better than with him off the floor. Here's the +/- for all the Raptors for Game 1 against Orlando    Player | +/- ------|--- Lowry | +11 Kawhi | -2 Green | -8 Siakam | -4 Gasol | -2 FVV | -16 Ibaka | +1 Powell | +1 Jodie Meeks | +4  &gt; Before Kawhi Kyle was by in large known as a playoff underachiever.  And yet, like the other person showed you, he has had good playoffs in totality. Just like with Paul George. They have bad games that are really bad, we hyperfocus on that cause we love to drop the hot takes that aren't backed up by looking at the bigger picture like you are doing.   &gt; Just google Kyle Lowry playoff struggles and dozens of articles from different years laying out all his stats pop up.  Don't need to. I'm a Raptors fan. I know the shit people lob at Lowry like even when he goes scoreless in a playoff game he is the only starter with a positive +/- or that if we look at the playoffs as a whole his slash numbers and True Shooting (which shits on FG and 3P as a measure of efficiency because it takes into account volume as well as free throws) he has had been above or at league average efficiency for every playoffs since 2016, and even with 2016 he was 19/4/6."
Just google Kyle Lowry playoff struggles. Years of articles pop up articulating how bad he‚Äôs been. Lmao don‚Äôt kill the messenger.
"I don‚Äôt know man. The raw numbers drop off, shooting percentages drop off. They are not good. Didn‚Äôt go he scoreless even just last year against the magic one game?  Before Kawhi, Kyle was by in large known as a playoff underachiever.  Just google Kyle Lowry playoff struggles and dozens of articles from different years laying out all his stats pop up.  .6 below league average? Sure but isn‚Äôt Kyle supposed to be the all star, leader and the guy? Why are you comparing him to league average?"
"What? Up until the Kawhi year and even in the phill series Lowrys playoff number have dramatically decreased from the regular season. In almost every way.   Don‚Äôt kill the messenger, but outside of the Kawhi year lowry has been utter dogshit in the playoffs.    https://www.google.ca/amp/s/fansided.com/2019/05/07/nylon-calculus-kyle-lowry-playoff-problem/amp/"
"Not really, Raptors have at least two. Kawhi Leonard is a lock for HOF, and Marc Gasol is a lock thanks to his international career in addition to his NBA career. Kyle Lowry probably doesn't make it, but there's a chance given how easy it is to get in."
"Kyle Lowry and Marc Gasol are hall of famers.   Though, it is the closest thing to this years Bucks, I guess"
People forget how much of a choker Kyle Lowry is.
"Lou Will, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Chuck Hayes, and Amir Johnson still have a group chat going from their Toronto days. That's incredible."
Last I checked basketball was a team sport. Saying what if is a fools game. What if Kyle Lowry was never born? What if dinosaurs never went extinct?
"Yeah I‚Äôve been saying this, Most of Kawhi‚Äôs success has come from playing with an elite point guard.. won a ring with the spurs playing with Tony Parker and Kyle Lowry on the raps.   He‚Äôs not an elite playmaker by any means so pairing him up with an elite scoring playmaking point guard would make the clippers even better."
"No thats not true, he can be the BEST player to ever don a Pels jersey, but no the greatest. Kyle Lowry is considered the GROAT (Greatest Raptor Of All Time), but Kawhi/Hakeem would be the BEST player to wear a Raps jersey. Nobody from New Orleans gonna claim AD as the greatest Pelican right now especially while Zion is here and for what CP3 has done for the city of NO"
Subverting this: Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart.  That backcourt would average 40 flops a game.
"Y‚Äôall sleeping on the Malachi Flynn + Kyle Lowry sign and trade. They get two guards, one for the present and one for the future"
"Well as I said you have to balance the salaries and as I didn‚Äôt go into depth it would take the Wolves adding Malik Beasley to get equal salaries of Beasley and Rubio to match Simmons (about 30m), also depends on what size contract Lowry could ask for. Toronto want to do Lowry a solid but getting Bolmaro, a pick and Rubio who can either start or be a veteran influence and then be flipped for another piece seems decent enough. 76ers getting Kyle Lowry and Malik Beasley might be enough to get the deal done."
People like you are the reason Kyle Lowry is leaving Toronto
Why does everyone think kyle Lowry is so good? I just don‚Äôt think so
Three team trade: Minnesota/Toronto/Philly  Minnesota receives Ben Simmons Toronto receives Ricky Rubio and 2020 first rounder Leandro Bolmaro and perhaps a future first  Philly receives Kyle Lowry and picks/filler.  Obviously trade needs to balance with other players added for salary matching reasons but Philly gets local boy with championship pedigree who is win now and fits with Embiid. Toronto get Ricky on an expiring who they can flip again and a top Argentinian who played for Barcelona last season and should fit into the Raptors international roster. Minnesota can put Simmons together with KAT and have Coach Finch make music between them. You still have Dlo in the back court and Ant-man scoring all over the place.
"Kyle Lowry, Tyrese Maxey and a 2nd."
I‚Äôve wanted Kyle Lowry in a heat jersey since the summer of 2014   Lebron taking 11 days to announce and Lowry signing immediately with toronto fucked my dream up
"Dude, were you hopped up on caffeine or some other upper when you wrote this?  Your post rubs as weirdly irritable and scatterbrained, considering the exchange started with me simply rebutting that Bron and AD are always injured, and that the Suns weren't nearly as banged up as the Lakers in the series... that somehow made you excited and angry?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;just because he doesnt put up the ppg doesnt make him bad  I didn't say he was?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Chris Paul did miss a game and play below strength, and they won.  That's pretty different from being below full strength for the entire series, that LeBron was.    &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Stop saying Bron wasnt 100, he had been back already.  (1) He came back from injury literally right before the Suns series.  (2) his initial high ankle injury was &lt;2 months below the playoffs, and he reaggravated it 2 weeks before the Suns series; his type of injury [normally takes 1.5-3 months to properly heal](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+time+out+for+high+ankle+sprain+nba&amp;oq=average+time+out+for+high+ankle+sprain+nba&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2j33i299.6464j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), and he just had weeks after the reaggravation. (3) [LeBron was specifically reported to not be full strength](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10004804-lebron-james-reportedly-was-85-healthy-from-ankle-injury-in-lakers-vs-suns-series) over the entire series.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No one gave kyle lowry the benefit when he had broken bone chips in his elbow or when he went out with an ankle injury vs Brons Cavs  I don't remember this and I'm not interested enough to look it up, but any non-superficial fan should account for star player injuries in the playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;if your roster construction is devoted 2/3 to those players. And one egg breaks. Thats on you.  Lol, cite me the last two teams that won a championship without at least two max players on it.  LMK how far back you have to go.  And both eggs broke (LeBron partially).   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Dont have depth? Dont cry bout it.   (1) The Lakers DID have decent depth, considering their salary allocation; (2) no one's crying about anything, dumbass; injuries happen, and the Suns are a good team.  We won the chip last year; how's YOUR team doing?  If you were less dense, you would've noticed that I never said that the Lakers definitely win if full strength (maybe you confused me with the other poster).  Game-by-game ratings can't be done b/c Bron was partially injured every single game, as discussed, but sure, the Suns might've beat a full-strength Lakers squad anyway.  The Lakers went in only like -175 series favorites.  But what's still flawed about your suddenly-frantic Suns fandom arguments are that pro-oddsmakers had them with only the 4th best championship odds in the West at the outset of the playoffs (and they factor in injury chances).  They in fact would not be in the Finals right now without a sick run of luck of opponent injuries.  For instance, let's say we give them the benefit of the doubt that they squeak by the Lakers, and beat the Nuggets even with Jamal; they would've lost to the Clippers in 5-6 games, considering their close victories and that the Clippers were missing their best player the entire time.  And, going into next year, at minimum the Clippers and Lakers will get better championship odds."
"Yes let‚Äôs already put defined ceilings on all the 19-year olds.   Kyle Lowry was probably projected to be a role player when he was drafted, look where he ended up. Player development is a real thing. These guys aren‚Äôt who they are in college for the rest of their careers."
I like Brogdon but he is an injury risk. Plus I don‚Äôt know if he takes you up to championship team level. I think the type of player philly needs is jimmy butler whom they are not getting. So the next best thing is demare derozan or kyle lowry. If they could get zach lavine he would be a good fit as well (like murray-joker pair). I don‚Äôt think you can win with sexton or the other names out there. It will be hard to convince people to trade a young asset for an old one but they may get draft picks and young players with derozan or lowry packages.
"ok chris paul isnt nearly as good but his team was one of the best in the west and the suns had a historic leap from his arrival.   just because he doesnt put up the ppg doesnt make him bad   See: steve nash   Chris Paul did miss a game and play below strength, and they won. Not in 7. in Six. Stop saying Bron wasnt 100, he had been back already. No one gave kyle lowry the benefit when he had broken bone chips in his elbow or when he went out with an ankle injury vs Brons Cavs. Calling them trash bros. Well that Trash Bro, carried the Raps. So. Stop.   Home Court matters, even if AD was around its game 7 in Phx.   And finally, injuries do happen and often to athletic big men in the paint more so. And if your roster construction is devoted 2/3 to those players. And one egg breaks. Thats on you. The Suns existed with Cam Payne and next man up. Dont have depth? Dont cry bout it.   Suns won Game 1, teams healthy. Game 2 was a fucking Ref joke. Garbage time fts made it even. Suns won game 4 with AD leaving mid game, still suns were up 16 going into 4q.   So Game 5 No AD, suns stomped, they were at home.   Game 6, up 21 at half, 18/35 from 3. You arent beating that with AD.   Im not a Suns lifer, but take the L"
The size of his ass. For example Kyle Lowry thicc as shit. Kevin Durant isn‚Äôt. One is a guard one is a forward
"I mean Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle and multiple firsts likely brings back a player a hell of a lot better and younger than Lowry.  Add in an extra first and that gets pretty tough to beat for a Lillard type player.  That is a massive overpay for Kyle Lowry at age 36-38 on a contract that will likely be $20M per year, let alone on a sign and trade.  They could use Hill and any moderate contract (~$7.5M) plus a first to negotiate a sign and trade with OKC without Toronto involved if Lowry really wanted to play in Philly.  Just sign Mike Scott to a partial guarantee with a wink and a nod that he will be cut and OKC could get a first and lose a couple million in space they won't use.  OKC would do that in a heartbeat along with a ton of other teams."
"Lowry Game 6 in the finals.  After the blocked shot ending, comes out and scores the first 8 points for the Raptors.  Could also throw in last year's Game 6 vs Boston as well. Just classic Kyle games in the playoffs where he scores and helps the team out."
"I think if they could add Kyle Lowry that'd be massive too. They still have the Hayward trade exception, not sure if it can be used in a sign and trade though."
"I mean, they basically had it figured out when they were up 3-1 against the warriors. That was a massive chock job. I think Tatum and Brown have a chance. They just need Kyle Lowry... lol"
Kyle Lowry is a free agent as well as Mike Conley.
I agree and he‚Äôs definitely near the top as well. But one executive inherited Steph Curry and the other inherited Kyle Lowry. I think he did the most with what he had.
Kyle Lowry exists?
"Yeah. The Kings wouldn't let go of Fox that easy. If the Sixers could at least lock down Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley in free agency/a sign-and-trade, they wouldn't need to definitely trade Simmons for a point guard/playmaker and have a lot more options."
do Sixers with Kyle Lowry and no Ben Simmons win the chip?
"Minnesota gets: Ben Simmons    Philly gets: Kyle Lowry, Malik Beasley, Ricky Rubio, Minnesota 1st   Toronto gets: Minnesota 1st     lets do it"
"Ok. Not everyone sees it the same.  I remember Kyle Lowry got asked what he thinks about all the booty comments, and he basically said that he doesn't like it and it just makes him uncomfortable. Understandably, there are lots of people that just don't want sexual comments made about them all the time, man or woman."
"Sure, but these stuff already happened. He is not 23 and this not a turning point for him.  I am not going to pretend all these failures did not happen to him along the way because they did, and we always redefine athletes by their lowest moments. I know its CP3 love fest, and he totally earned it, but ffs, its like he had a Kyle Lowry career and we just realized how great he is."
How about Kyle Lowry and a pick üëÄüëÄ
Suggs cause he‚Äôs next up  They should hope Mobley falls to them but Suggs would be a good replacement to Kyle Lowry or a nice guy to build around if they want to blow it up
Kyle Lowry getting big men paid.
"Yeah, besides the dunk contest, i never really heard of him during the regular season. Dunk contest and his beef with Kyle Lowry are the only things I know of him"
"I dunno.  Maybe send the Raps a quarter billion dollars in untraceable crypto to arrange a Kyle Lowry sign and trade?  Clips get Kyle on something like a 2 year $50 mil deal, Raps get Bev and Rondo's expiring deals, the 25th pick, and $250 mil in illegal cash considerations.  this is a joke btw"
This is like Kyle Lowry vs Mario Chalmers
Kyle Lowry to NYK for 3 years $80M. Make it happen @ Leon Rose.
"Trading an a bench player (George Hill) for 2 guys and a pick is not the same as trading Kyle Lowry and Chris Boucher to move up 1 spot. You're far more likely to get Fultz or McDyess than you are Luka.  Raptrors are absolutely a contender, whether you want to call it injuries or selective tanking no player played over 61 games. You're putting your team into potential NBA purgatory to move up 1 spot.  Kevin Love is a negative asset. You'd have to attach a pick just to get rid of him.  If you want a rebuild do it:  A Pick(s) for Lowry A Pick for Boucher Multiple Picks for Siakam, VanVleet, and even OG too. A Pick for taking on Love's contract.  You could walk away with a Thunder style haul. It's all moot, the Raptors are obviously planning on competing, They traded Powell for Hood not a pick."
Dudes talking about some fucking Kyle Lowry Chris Paul was the real deal
"there's only so many of those teams, though, and he's competing with (i guess) reggie jackson, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie...."
Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet are both 6.0
"&gt;no disrespect to reggie but the clips can do a lot better than him for their starting PG. Imagine if lillard forces a trade there? More realistically, kevin lowry would be a huge upgrade as well.  Fine, clips can take *kevin* lowry so long as Kyle Lowry stays on the raps :)"
Kyle Lowry is 36y old.
i‚Äôve always looked at mike conley as a worse kyle lowry
So this team is essentially just the Trail Blazers if they trade Dame for PG and clear cap space for Kyle Lowry?   I mean there is definitely a lot of depth but having a team just built around 1 superstar is probably more valuable than having multiple 2nd tier All-Stars. Most likely result is 2nd round out in the West and Conference Finals appearance in the East if they get the right seeding.
"I‚Äôm real high on Maxey and Tisse ofc but that‚Äôs about it. I sorta see Maxey as being a Kyle Lowry but better (dont know if that‚Äôs a lowball or not) and I don‚Äôt know Mattise‚Äôs ceiling until he gets a reliable shot of any kind.   Besides them we don‚Äôt really got anybody else. There *are* no stars on the roster aside from Jo, so we can‚Äôt trade Ben or Tobias for High picks. Top 15 for either of them would be generous and the only way id see it happening is if a real contender thought that one of them could put em over the hump and were in possession.  No disrespect to yur Cavs I just don‚Äôt see them having particularly *great* things ahead :(. Collin is awsome, garland is good, and Cedi is cool. Fro too. But none of them strike me as guys that can put you into the top eight. With Mo-town, Jerami Grant while not really ‚Äúyoung‚Äù is a player who‚Äôs proven he can keep himself within a deep playoff team rotation and Killian Hayes is too fresh to say anything about. Ln top of that they‚Äôll go number 1. Who knows what Cade‚Äôll be"
Kyle Lowry definitely saw how CP3 pulls constant BS in games like 7 years ago and was like I need to copy that.  I love Paul too but some of the stuff he does is just embarrassing
"He's the Kyle Lowry of the western conference. Fantastic player, great teammate, but goddamn he got some bitch tendencies."
"It's not a dirty list, its a list of players that other fanbases hate for their antics. I'd put Kyle Lowry on here too and he's not dirty.  Now, Dragic. Fuck that guy."
Kyle Lowry- 12 seasons   Marc Gasol- 10 seasons   John Stockton- 12 seasons   Karl Malone- 11 seasons  David Robinson- 10 seasons   Kevin Garnett- 12 seasons   Chris Paul has waited 16 seasons
very similar to Kyle Lowry after making his first Finals in 2019
Tell me you don't watch Kyle Lowry without telling me you don't watch Kyle Lowry
"No idiot, when tf did have have 5 all stars that lost to kyle lowry???"
lol we did. y‚Äôall had 5 all stars and couldn‚Äôt beat Kyle Lowry
I wouldn't call Kyle Lowry an elite floor general.
Kyle Lowry another proof point üêê
"Yeah the lakers need a another guard that can create, but also shoot. You ever heard of a guy named Kyle Lowry? Lmao  You are fooling yourself that the Westbrook experiment will be successful like the last two teams that traded him."
Bruh and morey had the audacity to call what the raptors wanted for Kyle Lowry Lala land
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
Would you take Kyle Lowry (s&amp;t) + a future 1st?
"It's not a bad move, but the Hield trade would be better as they could just get Kyle Lowry as the PG instead of vet-min shooters with Westbrook."
"Even as a Westbrook fan, it's pretty obvious that the Hield trade is the better move. They could still get a point guard in Kyle Lowry."
"It's one or the other. Honestly even as a Westbrook fan, the Hield trade would be the better move for the Lakers as they need shooting. Plus, they could also acquire Kyle Lowry."
"These mother fuckers are really about to get buddy, Westbrook, demar and Lowry for Kyle Kuzma and some I O U notes"
Kyle Lowry is a free agent? How would you even make these salaries match? This sounds like a lie
"TBH think the market for Lowry is why Daryl is leaking these ridiculous asking prices all over. He wants Kyle &amp; pieces, but Masai is in a superior position given the frothy marketplace for Lowry‚Äôs services. Pricing Simmons high is a (transparent) effort to increase his perceived value to buyers."
"&gt; NEW YORK ‚Äî The Golden State Warriors basically assumed the 76ers‚Äô offer as a joke.  &gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight‚Äôs NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer.  &gt; This comes after a source confirmed The Ringer report that the Sixers asked the San Antonio Spurs for four first-round picks, three first-round pick swaps and a young player in exchange for Simmons.  &gt; According to The Action Network, the Toronto Raptors rejected the Sixers‚Äô asking price of Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the fourth pick in tonight‚Äôs draft for a package that included Simmons.   &gt; One league executive said the Sixers are making ‚Äútotally outlandish offers.‚Äù"
Mavs gonna try and outbid everyone for 35yr old Kyle Lowry.  That's how you know Cuban is still running the team.  He just hired a guy with better player/agent connections.
(Kyle would take you to the ECF/maybe finals so Lowry sign and trade + picks for Simmons given his recent performance and lack of offensive improvement does actually seem fair imo) (yes of course I am biased)
"Haven't been following so had to look this up...  &gt; The Philadelphia 76ers reportedly offered Ben Simmons to the Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the No. 4 overall draft pick  LMAO wtf.    Masai probably rolled right out of his chair with that kind of ""offer"""
Kyle Lowry straight up.
-Kyle Lowry
Unless your name is Kyle Lowry
"I remember 2006 was regarded as a weak class very early. It turned out a number of guys who had respectable careers, though: Kyle Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rajon Rondo, J.J. Redick, and Paul Millsap come to mind. Not a standout class, but it turned out a bit better than people thought, and definitely better than 2000."
"Ben Simmons for Jimmy Butler. Makes a lot of sense for both sides, Miami to get off Butler‚Äôs timeline, and Philly to salvage a superstar in a trade for Simmons to try to continue to compete.  More so, there are swirling rumors of Kyle Lowry wanting to go to Philly, and he happens to be good friends with Jimmy Butler."
"1) There have been wide disparities in people's opinions on Ben Simmons' trade value, from aging veteran scorers like CJ McCollum or Kyle Lowry, to young all stars. How do you think the league views his trade value?  2) Do you expect there to be any trades in the top half of tonight's draft?"
what are the most likely scenarios for kyle lowry? just based on your gut feeling.
Who do you view as the favorite to sign Kyle Lowry?
"No, the Sixers didn't want to give up draft compensation  &gt; As for Philadelphia, which was reportedly close to a Lowry deal but wound up opting for Oklahoma City‚Äôs George Hill instead, a source with knowledge of the talks said the Raptors indeed believed they were very close on that front late in the process and that the draft compensation was the final unresolved hurdle. The plan, the source said, was for Toronto to re-route Sixers guard Danny Green to a third team.  [Source](https://theathletic.com/2478518/2021/03/26/why-no-kyle-lowry-trade-got-done-and-a-closer-look-at-the-ones-that-did-amicks-nba-trade-deadline-reflections/?redirected=1)"
"&gt;it's the Heat who actually lost not making the deal  &amp;#x200B;  loooool, you're not as smart as you think, who you tryna trick LOL no way herro/duncan/nunn are going for  kyle fucking lowry"
"Jrue Holiday hauled Adams, Bledsoe, two FRPs and two swaps. Ben Simmons value may be low but some people think we can do a player swap for Kyle Lowry and that it seems fair lmao. I just want the situation to be over with so I don‚Äôt have to listen to the the armchair GMs anymore."
"Not understanding the value Kyle Lowry bring to a team is the epitome of not understanding basketball, but you do you. Have a good one!"
Yup! You'll miss Kyle Lowry a lot less with that guy in a Raptors uniform. Torch passed. He'll be in a Drake lyric by the end of the weekend. LoL. Absolute only thing I don't know about is his fit with FVV but you guys would know more than I would
"Difference being that Raptors were fine with keeping Lowry for the remainder of the season.          We weren‚Äôt dying to trade Kyle, and Kyle himself was fine with not being traded (as never asked out).         These situations are very different."
"I don't get the Kyle Lowry fit tbh. He's my favorite player but Dallas needs a big, not a point guard. Their guard rotation is already good."
"Is it just me, or are both of these ideas not very good for the Mavs? Kawhi is a personality issue on a team, and Mavs already seem to have some of those issues. Plus, there's a good chance you'll get nothing from Kawhi until the playoffs this coming season, if you even get that. He's getting older and has a bad injury history.  But then the fall back is for the very good but not great Kyle Lowry, who's also old.  I get that your window is now with Luka, but don't forget that he's also really young. I'd rather draft some tough young players to develop with Luka rather than get aging veterans at a high price tag."
Kyle Lowry
"Everyone clamoring to throw huge money at Kyle Lowry while saying Kemba Walker is broken. Meanwhile, Lowry has only played 5 more games than Kemba in the last two seasons and he‚Äôs 4 years older. Perception is a funny thing."
Are we sure Kyle Lowry is a franchise turner as he‚Äôs being labeled as. Am I the only one that thinks it‚Äôs crazy a 35 year old point guard wants 30 mil a year. I know Chris Paul did his thing as an older PG but it was an outlier.
I think early 30s are now a part of an athlete's best years these days.  Players have access to so much more knowledge on how to take care of their bodies than 20-30 years ago. There doesn't seem to be that drastic drop off for most guys anymore.   Kyle Lowry is in his mid 30's and is one of the best available players in free agency and has a ton of teams wanting him. Maybe he's not quite at his peak anymore but he's always up there in minutes played per game. No one expects his performance to drop off drastically for another couple of years.
Kyle Lowry is gonna get a bag this summer and he‚Äôs got CP3 to thank for it
"If you are expecting Lowry to be your Chris Paul you will end up bad. Kyle is good, but he ain't CP3."
"I legit think the trade thats gonna happen is Kyle Lowry,Chris Boucher and a protected pick for Simmons"
"Its like he is doing his best to piss Zion off  Though that Valanciunas trade might be a turning point, they got rid of Adams &amp; Bledsoe. If they do get Kyle Lowry suddenly things are getting very interesting down in New Orleans"
"He's excellent. Sets some big booty screens, capable of spotting up from deep, and is always active. He's logged a lot of minutes playing in 2-PG lineups with Dragic, Calderon, Vasquez, Corey Joseph, and Van Vleet (not sure if he ever shared the floor with Conley or Brooks for extended time). I don't see why he wouldn't be great with Doncic. Kyle Lowry have it all."
"How many of those shots were created by Lowry?        Kyle &amp; Pascal were 2A/2B in that playoff run, with Gaosl/Ibaka/VanVleet all having games that they looked like the second best player on the floor."
Kyle Lowry is and has been the only big to ever play professional basketball
Just got off the phone. He says he stayin in Toronto and that Kyle Lowry wants to go to the knicks cuz he likes the pizza and subs
you dont watch kyle lowry and thats OK. just refrain from commenting
"Because people misconstrue what 'position-less basketball' is  Position-less basketball is like in a line up of Lebron, Kuzma, KCP, AD, Drummond even though traditionally Lebron is a 3, he's playing PG  And in the Mav's roster last year when there wasn't an elite playmaker besides Doncic he is the defacto PG  but when you have a CP3, or Kyle Lowry who are small elite playmakers ofcourse your small elite playmaker is your PG, he can't play as anything else."
"Ja's missed on Kevin Love wouldnt have changed history, but it would be insane so Ill mention it. But easily KD in game 7 against the bucks is up there. Another is Kyle lowry in game 5 2019 where he hit the backboard. Also Danny Green against Miami - caps off LeBrons insane game"
I don't know this for sure but I think switching teams at the end of your career can be really hard.  I'm very curious what happens with Kyle Lowry if/when he leaves Toronto this year.
A majority of people think kyle lowry is a hall of famer him and rondo  have had similar careers    Rondo is also slightly more accomplished than reggie miller so his chances are pretty high
I meant stylistically. I'd also rather have Kyle Lowry.  But I'd bet 90% of casual fans would take Russ over Lowry.
Kyle Lowry in lieu of Lonzo Ball or alongside him? Cause I'll tell ya what - Jrue was about as good as Lowry and then some
"I don't understand this infatuation with Kyle Lowry. Is it just because it's a weak free agent class? The guy is 35 years old and had a long history of playoff chokes until 2019. He's solid defensively, but he's a mediocre playmaker. Do people really think he's going to have a Chris Paul-like late career resurgence?"
‚ÄúKyle Lowry‚Äù as their ‚ÄúChris Paul‚ÄùüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
The goal seems to be THJ and Lowry  [How the mavs get THJ and Lowry](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/7/28/22596599/how-can-the-mavericks-sign-kyle-lowry-and-tim-hardaway-jr)
"""to add Kyle Lowry as their Chris Paul.""  LOL. That's funny. Maybe they can sign Trevor Ariza to be their LeBron James too."
I'm a simple man . Give me DeRozan and picks. Sign his boy Kyle Lowry. Let's rock out for that chip!
Kyle Lowry
"They've always been like this, they overrated their players to the max  They were defending DeRozan until the last moment, then when they traded him the bias was off and they realized how he wasn't a winning player  Kyle Lowry was a serial choker until he got bailed out by Kawhi and now they hold him on the same tier as CP3 lmao"
They have convinced themselves that Kyle Lowry would've *guaranteed* us a ring. Peak homerism.
i can see it if they think they‚Äôre getting kyle lowry too. he fills a lot of those holes
Kyle Lowry is not Chris Paul or anything close.  Love the guy but is he a top 15 PG now?  Not for me‚Ä¶
Kyle Lowry is very good. Kyle Lowry is not CP3.
My point is everyone knows that as great as Lowry is he's not doing that. Lowry is not Chris Paul and I doubt any team is stupid enough to think so. All the teams trying to pay him are teams that are trying to find a traditional PG and Kyle is the best available one.
"You obviously a casual, we are looking for a secondary ball handler because Luka usage rate is too high, Kyle Lowry would get his fair share of the possesion."
Kyle Lowry got Kyle Lowry paid. Winning a ring and being an overall fantastic point guard + 6-time all-star kinda gets you paid....
Kyle Lowry and his fine ass gonna look great standing in the corner on Dallas
It's so funny that Chris Paul got Kyle Lowry paid this summer lmaooo
A Chris Paul can be anything he can even be a Kyle Lowry
"I mean, 3 coaches in 3 years is objectively bad, but that's just a slice of the problem. The larger problem seems to be this team's management has no vision for what they want to build with their roster or what their timeline should be.  Yes Bledsoe was already a negative asset, but that just begs the question - why trade a good player for a negative asset if you're trying to be competitive now? Adams was an expiring contract, so why double down and give him an extension immediately before seeing how he fit the roster? The Adams extension was ridiculed when it happened and now, sure enough, ~1 year later David Griffin is giving up assets just to be rid of it.  And what are the Pels trying to do with that cap space you mentioned? They want leadership in the locker room and on the defensive end of the court so they are now trying to make another win-now move by giving an aging Kyle Lowry a big multi-year deal. That would make sense, in a vacuum, but it feels a little hollow when you remember, they **already had Jrue**. Why trade him away for picks if you were just going to turn around and attempt to find a more expensive/older substitute on the FA market?   Maybe they don't get Lowry and instead they just pay to keep Lonzo. What then? Your team hasn't gotten any better and you're just banking on rookies and internal improvements from a new rookie coach to get you into the playoffs?"
"He‚Äôs been a PG his whole life , now when he‚Äôs going to the nba he‚Äôs a SF? He‚Äôs gonna prove you so wrong ahahah.  Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt explosive , Luka isn‚Äôt , lamelo , however all these guys are super skilled just like Cade. Also his handle is definitely above average, people see him as the third best prospect in the last 15 years for a reason"
"How many minutes did Maxey and Thybulle get in playoffs?            Sixers with Lowry would have not lost to Hawks, and neither Bucks, nor Suns were invincible. Going back, it would be foolish to not make that deal.          &gt;	An expiring 35 yo Lowry who was gonna ask for $25-30 3 year contract   Kyle was looking for a $50M contract for 2 years. That‚Äôs an overpay? You are paying Ben Simmons and Tobias +$30M.            It‚Äôs a 2 year deal, if he didn‚Äôt work out, trading him wouldn‚Äôt have been hard."
Kyle Lowry sign and trade confirmed
If you think Kyle Lowry is worth Ben Simmons straight up then your blatant homer delusions aren‚Äôt worth discussing. We‚Äôve literally already turned down offers for more than that.
"To answer your last sentence, look at what Morey asked from us for Simmons lol.  If nobody met Masai‚Äôs demands because Lowry would be cheaper now, then Masai is right to wait, since now everyone is competing to get Lowry to sign with them.   Who? Literally every team interested at the deadline still wants to sign and trade for him. If he‚Äôs so old and decrepit how come teams are lining up to offer him between 20-30 million per year despite not even having the cap space yet?Teams like the Pelicans and Mavs are motivated now because getting Lowry means you get him locked up to a deal instead of as an expiring free agent, he‚Äôs worth more to *those* teams now than at the deadline.  I know you really want Masai to look bad here but the evidence isn‚Äôt there man. Idk what to tell you, he‚Äôs not greedy for wanting more than Duncan Robinson or Tyrese Maxey for Kyle Lowry.  The Sixers clearly don‚Äôt value Lowry the same way and won‚Äôt offer a competitive contract so don‚Äôt worry, you probably won‚Äôt be getting him. Lowry is getting paid and depending on who it is we might even get better compensation back. I‚Äôm losing no sleep if he walks and we don‚Äôt have Maxey or Duncan"
Look at this dude acting like Kyle Lowry isn't a notorious flopper
Whoever pays Kyle Lowry that money will immediately regret it. Next kemba contract
One to talk with Kyle ‚Äúhook arm‚Äù Lowry being the greatest raptor ever. But nonetheless touch√©.
"&gt; if ppl wanted him then he would already be traded, Woj literally said he was offered to every team and no one wants that negative asset so far lol  That is definitely not ""literally"" what Woj said. He said the Lakers have brought him and KCP up in trade talks with everyone, which is not surprising as they're basically the only guys the Lakers are allowed to talk about right now. They're not offering LeBron and AD to anyone, so the only other guys currently under contract with the Lakers for next year are Marc Gasol, Alfonzo McKinnie (both of whom make the minimum), and then KCP and Kuzma. So if they're talking to other teams, as they should be, that's literally all they are allowed to talk about.   As for why nobody has traded for them yet, that's because a lot of whom they're interested in can't be talked to yet as they're free agents (like Kyle Lowry, for example). And on top of that, one of their best trade chips, the 22nd pick, can't be moved until after the draft. Additionally, they also *may* have Montrezl Harrell to offer in trades, but he has to decide if he's opting in or not first, and they're prohibited from talking to their own free agents about new contracts or sign and trades.   It would be stupid for the Lakers to be making trades now before the draft or free agency when they don't yet have their full compliment of trade assets, just as it would be for any team. That's why we haven't seen hardly any trades from anyone yet. So you can cling to this idea that ""nobody wants Kuzma"" if you want to, but I'm telling you that you're gonna be wrong and end up looking foolish for this take in about a week or so."
Kyle Lowry in shambles
Kyle Lowry
"I mean, he was generally a floor raiser similar to westbrook. The 03 Magic had no business being in the playoffs let alone being up 3-1 to the Pistons.   The 22 game win streak with the rockets in 08, when the second best player on the floor was Rafer Alston or a 36 year old Luis Scola. Yao went down 10(?) Games in. He dragged that Houston team to the playoffs in one of the most blood bath season in the west. 8 teams winning 50+ and 10 teams winning 48+.    You'd really just have listen to JVG talk about him or even Kyle Lowry from his brief time coming off the bench in Houston."
"Exactly what youd say if, after losing to the Hawks, id said ""if Kyle Lowry was on the sixers, this would be a championship team"""
Im not a fan of Kyle Lowry on the Knicks they need a pg who has a high 3%
"In their quest to make a big splash in free agency, the New Orleans Pelicans are reportedly drawing inspiration from the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns.   Per ESPN's Brian Windhorst, Pelicans president of basketball operations David Griffin is hoping to make a ""huge offer"" to Kyle Lowry ""in an effort to import the type of leadership that Chris Paul brought to the Suns last year in morphing them into contenders  Umm u GONNA let ball walk and get Lowry?"
"Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶..  3/14  7/14  3/7  1/3  If all y‚Äôall‚Äôs best players played bad because they shot low percentages from the field, then there is no way you would have swept, right?  Or maybe‚Ä¶just maybe‚Ä¶.shooting 42% as the first option in a playoff series on 20 ppg isn‚Äôt actually bad‚Ä¶  80% of first option players will have lower efficiency in the playoffs. That‚Äôs just how it works. You can get focused on more, the team learns everything about you, and in this case you are playing four straight games against a top 10 defense then seven straight against a top 4 immediately after, while also being elite on the defensive end. Siakam was not the 27 ppg guy like he was the first few months of that season or whatever, but he was still good. Stop trying to just put him down to raise Lowry up. Lowry does not have an argument against CP3. End of story."
"Not sure, I just don‚Äôt want to have to cheer for Kyle Lowry"
"&gt; I don't see any team trading an all star-caliber PG for any combo of those pieces.   They might if that PG is either an unrestricted free agent who might tell his team to trade him to the Lakers or he'll just walk and leave his team with nothing (i.e. possibly Kyle Lowry or *maybe* Chris Paul), or if that PG is incredibly overpaid to where his team might just want to get off his contract (i.e. Kemba Walker or Russell Westbrook). It's not like they could use these pieces for Steph or Dame though, obviously.   &gt; the Lakers don't have many picks to trade.   They have the 22nd pick in this year's draft and their 2027 1st round pick, along with a bunch of 2nds.  &gt; Kuz has seemingly been on the trade market for years now and no trades have materialized.   That's not really accurate, or rather doesn't reflect the truth there. Up until free agency starts and Kuzma's extension kicks in, he'll have been on his rookie contract this whole time, meaning before this season he was on a deal that paid him less than $2 million per year. Just because of the need to match salaries, it's impossible to trade a guy making that little and get anything valuable in return, and at that price the Lakers wanted to keep him and see how he developed. It's tough to get good rotation players for less than the minimum like that.   Once Kuzma signed that extension last off-season it made trading him this year basically impossible because of [the poison pill provision,](https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1340781915226435588?s=19) and because the Lakers were hard capped. This upcoming free agency is really the first time in Kuzma's entire career where it will have made any sense for the Lakers to trade him. That's why nothing has ever materialized. People on here have talked about him getting traded for years, but it has never been realistic before now.   &gt; Lakers aren't really in any position of leverage with the assets they have.   This is wrong for one reason, and it applies to all three players: Bird rights. It's the same reason why Lowry is probably going to be signed and traded rather than just signing as a free agent: because the good teams who might want him are capped out, so he'll need to involve the team that has his Bird rights to get to where he wants to go.   Maybe if Schroder and Caruso get monster offers in free agency from teams they want to play for then they'll leave (as would Kyle Lowry if that happened), but it's highly unlikely that happens. Some shitty team with a lot of cap space isn't going to want to blow it on those guys. The only teams who might want to give them big deals are contenders looking for more depth, but those teams are capped out, and thus would need the Lakers involvement.   THT is a different case because he's [a restricted free agent that is Arenas limited,](https://youtu.be/YdCOrUGdgg8) meaning teams can't offer him more than the MLE, and the Lakers are able to match any offer he gets. So if some team desperately wants him, they probably will need the Lakers involvement as well.   So the Lakers don't have *total* leverage over those guys, but it's wrong to say they ""aren't really in any position of leverage."""

kyle lowry skullfucked your team without a star
Love me some Kyle Lowry but CP3 was a top 5 mvp candidate for a reason.  This is why the RANGS argument is so dumb sometimes.
"I‚Äôd say they woulda lost to the clippers if it were Lowry and not CP3. Look, I love Kyle and he was huge for us in the championship run. But he just ain‚Äôt dropping 41 and 8 to close out the Clips"
"It‚Äôs clearly in the middle. If I‚Äôm an organization and I sign Kyle Lowry to a 3 year deal I‚Äôm HOPING for two productive years and a ‚Äúfall off‚Äù year when his deal is expiring. That‚Äôs the best case scenario. Who on God‚Äôs green earth thinks that Lowry is gonna drop 17/4/7, play 75 games a year, and walk out of a three year deal unscathed at 38-39 and angle for another big time contract? It‚Äôs an unreasonable expectation. The worst case? I get one good year out of him, he declines the next season, I take some flak from the media, and then I dump his contract the last year.  The real scary deals are giving max contracts out to guys in their ‚Äúprime‚Äù. You start giving out 5/6 year deals and after a year of shit play or injuries you are absolutely stuck with that player for another 4 seasons."
"&gt;why are we listening to him in the first place?  tomorrow i can make a website and from that website type out some headline like   Charles Babbycock at clutchbasketballnba reports 'Sources state that Lakers are frontrunners in the kyle lowry sweepstakes. Kyle Lowry still wants around 30 million, but is willing to compromise to win one last championship before he retires'  within an hour in r/nba that post will have 1000 comments all talking about it as if its legitimate, with the few people wondering who tf babbycock is being drowned out in all the speculation"
"if people who think morey has anything other than brain lesions for picking george hill/playoff no-shows over kyle lowry are the ones chiming in about whose fanbase is good, it really tells you everything about how little it matters"
"He played 46/72 games last season, even accounting for games that he sit when the Raptors tank that's still a good chunk of the season that he rested.  And he played 58/72 and 11/11 during the bubble season, including a long break during the lockdown.  Yes his MPG is 36.2 but let's not act like he is an iron man playing all games of the season and never get taken off the lineup. Not to mention he have some trouble with his left thumb 5 months ago, the same thumb he had trouble with 2 years ago. It can be problematic later on. [Source](https://hoopshype.com/storyline/kyle-lowry-injury/)  People are forgetting that he gonna add another year and the Pel gonna need him to play a lot more than just 60 games in the regular season if they wan to be in the playoff race.  Did we forget that LeBron James, who was widely regard as an ironman suffered from injury this year?  Same with Harden?"
Kyle Lowry would 100% make your Ben Simmons problem less of a problem though
Lol this guy thinks he's Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry wouldn‚Äôt be fixing our Ben Simmons problem
"You're saying that Kyle Lowry, who was 4th in the league in MPG in the bubble season, who had the third-highest MPG of his career that year, and who averaged 41MPG in our 7-game second round series was resting up?"
"&gt;He says that he loves watching Kyle Lowry as a competitor and says that the mindset he carries should be in every player, himself included."
" Bucks didn‚Äôt really look invincible, they looked in trouble against Durant playing pretty much by himself and against Hawks.            Atlanta went to 6 games with Bucks, your team with Kyle could definitely go to at least 7. Even if you aren‚Äôt the favorite, why wouldn‚Äôt you want to be a game 7 away from a chip or at least NBA Finals?              You have to take risks to win a chip. In hindsight, trading for Hill instead of Lowry was a wrong move."
Kyle Lowry ain't no spot-up shooter
Y‚Äôall forgot the *Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up shooter*
"We lost Lowry but we also lost our worst players. Very easy concept. This bench will not throw games away at the level last year‚Äôs one did.  Also Kyle already played way less games than usual, it‚Äôs not like we weren‚Äôt winning without him   It doesn‚Äôt matter if our starting lineup went supernova if we‚Äôd sub in Baynes and the other team would instantly go on a run. He‚Äôs gone.  Knicks/Celtics/Bulls are not good. If we‚Äôre down there they‚Äôre with us."
"These aren‚Äôt big name free agents though. Raptors have retained guys like Serge Ibaka, Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry before. Those are bigger names than Portis &amp; Holiday. I really don‚Äôt see what your point is with Milwaukee."
I don‚Äôt think those are scraps; I think those are quality role players and plus defenders that Lowry doesn‚Äôt make up for. He‚Äôs Kyle Lowry not Dame.
"No.  I don‚Äôt think Kyle Lowry makes up for the loss of Danny Green, Thybulle, and Maxey."
because our side of the deal is done. its kyle lowry for dragic and precious. idk why raptors fans are like this lol probably cuz you guys are gonna be so ass
"I‚Äôm going to get downvoted but I‚Äôve only really watched dame in the playoffs and imo he‚Äôs not a #1 guy. There‚Äôs no way Portland could ever win with him on the supermax and I‚Äôm tired of seeing people say they should have made better moves.   Chris Paul needed two amazing young talents just to make the finals after years of struggling to get there, Kyrie couldn‚Äôt do it without lebron, Kyle Lowry couldn‚Äôt do it without kawhi. Undersized pg just can‚Äôt lead championship teams unless their name is steph Curry. And even then that happened thru the draft, not by making moves (talking about before KD got there).   Dame has always been overvalued imo and it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs just not in a position as a undersized pg to take over and win games when others aren‚Äôt performing."
"&gt; Not denouncing the trade at first  There was no trade in place though. Thats the problem. The only thing in place was a verbal commitment and terms from Lowry and the Heat camp of a signing but a trade to make it happen and the details of a trade werent made or agreed upon by neither the Raptors nor the Heat  None of the major reporters have announced any details of a trade agreement because nothing formal was made. These are the only reports that  were really made     &gt; [Goodwill] Kyle Lowry is expected to sign a three-year deal with the Miami Heat via sign and trade with the Toronto Raptors, sources tell @YahooSports  or   &gt; [Shams] Kyle Lowry is signing with the Miami Heat.  &gt; [Woj] Kyle Lowry has agreed to a three-year deal for approximately $90M with the Miami Heat, sources tell ESPN.  You wont find anything else on a trade. Just genericized reportings of the signing. Nothing about pieces in a trade were reported when Lowry came to an agreement with the Heat. This entire time Raptors and Heat fans have been wondering what was going to be included in the trade because Woj, Shams, Stein etc havent reported on anything formally on it  We're in a moratorium period anyways til tomorrow so nothing is really official anyways"
"You have to consider the risk vs reward, though (as well as the rest of the PG market). What was his upside on passing on it? He wasn't getting some $30 million annual value contract somewhere even if he played to his normal standards and his agent should have been aware of how many point guards would be on the market this year (including guys like Kyle Lowry who were leaving teams but not leaving a hole at pont guard that their own team would want to fill)."
Kyle Lowry
High: Harrison barnes - people still think hes trash from that finals series  Low: Kyle lowry - always thought he was overrated. Without kawhi his legacy would be just losing to lebron year after year much like derozan
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"kyle lowry had a 0 point game in game 1 against the magic in 2019 and he just got the bag from miami.   so I don't think it's necessarily just about one game.  dennis sucks lol, he's a 6th man type of player that thinks he's an elite PG and should be paid like one when he is anything but."
"I know Lillard must be a good NBA player, but why not get Stephen Curry or Kyle Lowry instead. My friends and family told me they're both better than him."
"Pelicans Plans:  A: Let's get CP3! I'm sure he'll come back to New Orleans!   B: Okay if we can't CP3, let's get Kyle Lowry  C: Fine, no Lowry at least we can still bring Lonzo back  D: Oh.. We're fucked... Ummmmm Davonte Graham? And lets ship out 3 first round picks out the door too."
[There already is a Kyle Lowry statue](https://i.redd.it/gxbrze8z41a51.jpg)
"[They were banking on the ‚ÄúChris Paul effect.‚Äù](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/07/27/kyle-lowry-free-agency-latest-pelicans-want-him-to-be-their-chris-paul-mavs-heat-76ers-interested/) Lonzo‚Äôs young, they wanted a veteran point guard to pair with their young core hoping for what Paul did with OKC and Phoenix."
&gt; kyle lowry ain't no....   Raptor  :(
Old as Kyle Lowry and PJ Tucker (whose playoff performance was overrated) isn‚Äôt going to catapult them into contenders
nobody on that team is elite. kinda silly to think a 35 year old kyle lowry is going to push them to a championship contender
Where did I say Kyle Lowry alone will make the difference?? The Heat is an overall better team than the Bucks by a lot next year
Oh I thought you were serious for a second then you said the Heat. The addition of Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt just reverse a sweep.
"He was not one game away from making the finals without Jordan, he was one game away from making the conference finals without Jordan - quite a difference. For context, Trae Young just successfully made the conference finals this year, so did Paul George. Bradley Beal and the Wizards were one game away from the conference finals in 2017, Kyle Lowry and the Raptors were one game away from the conference finals last year, Embiid and the Sixers have been there twice, etc. I don't want to belittle these players/teams because they're solid, but being a game away from the conference finals for one year is not necessarily a reliable barometer to project from."
I'm tryna see Kyle Lowry in the Aus women's uniform goddamn
KYLE LOWRY AIN'T NO SPOT UP SHOOTER.
"He had just finished his best season of his career with Phoenix and was about to play with Kyle Lowry, the king of getting centers the bag. There was no reason for him to be so shite. Large part of the reason we started 2-9 (or something terrible like that)."
Kyle Lowry changes that much?
"The GROAT, even with the trade deadline tension and the free agency market looming around the corner I was still not able to prepare for Kyle Lowry no longer being a Raptor... his impact on the Toronto Raptors and Canadian basketball cannot be understated. He is without a doubt the Greatest Raptor of All Time.   He led us to the golden age of the Toronto Raptors and brought us our first ever championship. He embodies everything about the process of working hard towards your goals and towards a better version of yourself. He arrived at the Raptors with not such a great reputation, but matured into an incredible teammate, leader and father.   Whatever criticisms were said of him or his character, he worked on and grew but always kept that fire and edge that set him apart from others. He wears his heart on his sleeve and I loved him for it - even if it meant initially clashing with management over the DeRozan trade or raising hell on the basketball court.  From his journey as a player and father, as a bestfriend to one of the most endearing duos in sports with DeRozan, as a leader of a championship winning basketball team. Kyle Lowry is above all else a great human being who reflects the trials, hardships and flaws we all try to work through to achieve what we want in life.   I'm crying a lot, but I knew I would cry when reading his goodbye post. Kyle Lowry, Toronto and Canada will love you forever and we hope that you retire as a Toronto Raptor. It would be the icing on the cake of the legacy that you leave behind as the Greatest Raptor of All Time.   Thank you for everything."

"That dirty bitch Dwyane Wade.  As much as other players annoy me like Lebron or Lowry whining to the referees, it's players that have actually tried to injure players on my favorite team. Wade did just that when he pulled down Rondo in a non-basketball play and [*dislocated his freaking elbow.*](https://youtu.be/he4OY6gJNX4)   Goran Dragic, Grayson Allen, and - shocker - Kyle Lowry also come to mind when thinking of guys that have made dirty plays against the Celtics. Fascinating that there's a common thread with THREE guys listed in my comment.  (hint: it must be HeAt CuLtUrE)"
NEITHER. I WANTED KYLE LOWRY OR LONZO
"&gt;I dont think they got worse...l just think they overperformed last year and I dont see it happening again.   You really think they overperformed? They were the second most injured team in the league by win shares last season and still finished 4th. They had the best record in the east since ASB after they changed their coach from one of the worst of all time to a good one despite all the injuries.   &gt;Philly blowing that series was 1000% on Ben forgeting how to play basketball. Trae and co stepped up big time and deserve all the credit for making it to the ECF...but if Ben plays even close to his capabilities that series ends different imo.  The series wouldn‚Äôt be different in any way if we‚Äòd consider that the Hawks played without their second best player in Hunter and without Reddish all series long. They also had to play a hobbled Bogdanovic who clearly still struggled with his knee.  I just don‚Äôt see a world where the Sixers with how their team was set up, would‚Äôve had a chance against a healthy Hawks team.  &gt;Clear tier below Nets and Bucks and I'd put the Heat above them as well given their upgrades in free agency.   They nearly won against the Bucks, again, despite missing important players due to injury. I‚Äôll confidently say that the Hawks would‚Äôve won with a healthy Reddish and Hunter. Having them below the Heat is ridiculous imo. That‚Äôs extreme recency bias. Thinking Kyle Lowry somehow changes the complete direction of this team is ludicrous. He‚Äôs not that type of player anymore. Neither is Butler if we‚Äòre at it."
"Current villains are the Suns, Sixers, and Simmons. Protags are Nuggets, Bucks, Giannis and Kyle Lowry.   Lakers will take a heel turn soon but half this sub is Laker fans."
Man just say you don‚Äôt know basketball. Kyle Lowry is a stud. And you said it your self your banking on injuries on the nets again. Don‚Äôt think you come close to beating a healthy bucks. You believe you man. I‚Äôm just being realistic. Just how I believe that my knicks won‚Äôt be the 4th seed again.
"See my edit above for you overselling about ‚Äúlosing to the Bucks without Giannis‚Äù we beat them once with him in their arena and we beat them when he played the majority of the game and we didn‚Äôt have trae.  And yes the Nets will be tough no one is denying that but they‚Äôre not a deep team so if they end up getting key injuries the Hawks have a shot.  Also Kyle Lowry is not the difference between a team getting swept in the first round and a team making a championship run especially at the age of 36. KL wasn‚Äôt even the 2nd option offensively for the 2019 raptors, Kawhi and Siakam were. Is he a good distributor and a plus defender? Yes. Is he even an all star level player anymore? No."
Why? Miami got swept by a team the hawks took to 6 and the only player of note they added was 36 year old Kyle Lowry.  People like to forget that under McMillian the Hawks had the best record in the East and that was while dealing with injuries to their entire starting 5 as well as key bench players.
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
Kyle Lowry was their best acquisition but it probably still wont be enough
Just got home from vacation. Kyle Lowry and Victor Oladipo to the Heat? Sheeeeeesh
too much time and money has now passed in FA. no1 left to give Kyle lowry 30 let alone like 20+ mill on the market. so this has to go thru or Kyle is fucked hard and Raps wouldn't do that. Kyle has already missed the big spending wave of free agency
"The trade wasn't ""Miami gives Precious Achiuwa and Toronto gives Kyle Lowry"", it was ""Miami gives Goran Dragic and Precious Achiuwa and Toronto gives Kyle Lowry"". Dragic is essential for the money to work, and, since the deal isn't officialized, literally nothing is stopping Toronto from just refusing to eat up Dragic's contract if we don't accept their terms.   Achiuwa would be the compensation if Miami had cap. They do not, so they need to offload Dragic to Toronto. Toronto can refuse to take Dragic if they want. It isn't rocket science, Miami needs Dragic on the trade and Toronto will accept it only with a 3rd team involved. No 3rd team, no Dragic. No Dragic, can't sign Lowry."
"in the NBL maybe  like, dude is immensely washed, he had trouble finishing layups last season.  he couldn't do it with kyle lowry feeding him, and when we got khem birch, he started doing things that we were looking for baynes to do all season"
"I'm inclined to say if the raptors had khem birch instead of baynes for the whole year, they make the playoffs. So I disagree with you a lot. He was awful. I like to use the analogy that Kyle Lowry essentially chewed food for him and spit it in his mouth but baynes somehow fumbled the swallowing process."
"Lakers reportedly had interest. Chicago been wanting him. Knicks had interest. Rumors of Clippers. Hornets, admittedly probably low or not at all. That‚Äôs 4-5 teams. The fleece was over you guys. You guys lost one of your talents, at at the very least a guy who could‚Äôve been traded at the deadline, and got nothing in return. NOLA can‚Äôt even sign 35yo Kyle Lowry or THJ so the chances of getting a big FA are low. FA weren‚Äôt flocking when AD, a generational talent and one of the best PF, so they not gonna come flocking when Zion‚Äôs future is tentative. With all that y‚Äôall better hope BI don‚Äôt just decide to leave"
"You‚Äôd think then knowing it‚Äôs hard to get notable FA to come to NOLA that they should look to keep their talent and let it grow, see how it pans out. Instead y‚Äôall bet everything on getting a 35yo Kyle Lowry against Miami. Now you‚Äôre gonna hype Graham up like he‚Äôs a beast? How do these recent events look in Zion‚Äôs eyes? He doesn‚Äôt get to play with his boy, sad but not horribly so. The package they got for Zo was significantly worse than what interest for Zo was. The team failed to get Kyle Lowry because FA aren‚Äôt running to NOLA, and then THJ took less to stay in Dallas.   If I‚Äôm Zion all I see is a team that traded a guy I wanted away for (being generous) another guy who is essentially the same, but less interest in the FA market. More salary cap space but no agents to come here, and less trade bait so less likely trading for a guy at the deadline. Add on top of that my 3rd coach in 3 years and my family wanting me to play elsewhere."
"Lowry is always only for himself.  He's trying to pressure Masai.  Good luck, Kyle."
"Might be well known, but Kyle Lowry was drafted to the Grizzlies, then was traded to thee Rockets three years later. He spent his first six years in the league on the non-Raptors. With his new 3-year contract, he'll likely spend just as much time on other teams as he spent with the Raptors.  &amp;#x200B;  (This is just a personal, fun one, but I started getting serious about basketball around 2013. It's really hard for me to get out of my head that Rudy Gay is not a Raptor's staple, he was barely on the team. That period just sticks out to me a lot)"
This the guy that Kyle Lowry literally blocked on Twitter üòÇ
Kyle Lowry is not better than Mike Conley.
"Obviously Thybulle is better than Prescious. That's why the Sixers didn't trade him at the deadline. The misconception Sixers fans have (further perpetuated by Daryl Morey's LaLa Land comment) is that the Raptors would only make the trade if Tbybulle was included.   That's not the case, he was part of the initial ask to negotiate with. The Raptors would've accepted Maxey, Green, Scott/Bradley and a FRP. But Morey refused to include a first. So it would've essentially been Maxey and a second round pick. That's a really shitty offer for Kyle Lowry. I like this trade better. The only team that took a L is the Sixers who wasted Embiid's best season by not bolstering themselves. George Hill wasn't it."
"He might not be in a Raptors jersey anymore, but the disrespect of putting Kyle Lowry in the same tier as Fox and Morant is simply silly.  We're talking about a guy who headlined this year's FA along with Chris Paul as THE targets for Championship teams."
&gt;huge ass  Dude put on like 20 lbs of Kyle Lowry back fat since he got to Chicago too.  Dudes out of shape with a busted back üò¨
And how were they going to build a title team this offseason when best player on market was Kyle Lowry?
Yeah this is it. Forgot Kyle Lowry had a pretty uneventful career up until Toronto.
"Chandler is definitely a great story.  I'll also point out Kyle Lowry. In his 2nd year the Grizzlies drafted Mike Conley to be their PG of the future and Lowry didn't show much. He got traded to the Rockets where he was a decent starter who showed flashes, and then on the Raptors finally became an All-Star in his 9th season. From there he made 6 consecutive All-Star appearances and became the veteran leader of a title team.  Edit: Also Steve Nash is a crazy story. In his early years in PHX stuck behind Kidd, KJ, and Cassell. Didn't become a regular starter until his age-27 season, and then out of nowhere became a 2-time MVP in his early 30s."
Did somebody mention Kyle Lowry?
"Maybe like a Kyle Lowry or something like that, that seems like a fair package"
Kyle Lowry
"Raptors are following a Masai retool pattern.   **First GM gig on Nuggets**  - trades best player: Carmelo - gets roster balancing pieces - almost right away they become a 57 win team, and best season in franchise history  **Second GM gig on Raptors**  - trades best player: Rudy Gay - gets roster balancing pieces - almost right away creates a 50+ win team, and best in franchise history  **Third go at roster building**  - sign and trades best player: Kyle Lowry - will get roster balancing pieces - hmmm  Masai has never purposely tanked. And this Raptors team will be better than you think."
"Like just imagine Heat commentators entering the arena and seeing Lowry, ‚Äú‚ÄúTHAT CANT BE‚Ä¶.THATS THATS KYLE LOWRY‚ÄôS MUSIC!?! WHAT IS HE DOING IN MIAMI, TORONTO HAS A GAME IN PORTLAND IN TWO HOURS!??!‚Äù"
[Kyle Lowry explains pressure](https://youtu.be/Jdx-7rBE0HY)
Hey man I I didn‚Äôt insult you for preferring Kyle Lowry
"2013/4 - 2017/8  Kyle Lowry 19.0/4.9/6.9, .388 3P%, .577 TS%, 50.7 Ws, 5.0 BPM, 22.7 VORP   Demar DeRozan 23.4/4.5/4.2, .304 3P%, .542 TS%, 41.3 WS, 1.9 BPM, 13.1 VORP  Seriously how is Demar better at all?  Lowry is the better floor and ceiling raiser it is not even a question.  Raptor fans liked Demar more because he was homegrown plus there were a bunch of vocal fans who didn't like Lowry's whining to refs and obviously his constant problems with Casey while Demar is just a likeable guy who they saw grow up from terrible in his first few years to a star."
Kyle did other things though and was still the main reason we were winning. Demar if he wasn't scoring well was a net negative while Lowry was still effective.
It‚Äôs a lot easier to see why Lowry would struggle next to Demar then why Demar would struggle next to Lowry. It was clear who was holding who back IMO. Plus we saw Demar be directly upgraded into a better version of himself and suddenly Kyle isn‚Äôt a problem anymore.
100% Kyle Lowry is better.
&gt;  Is Kyle Lowry seen as a better player then Demar?   Yes  -  &gt; Demar was definitely the better player on the raptors.   No
"Drake should rap about Kyle Lowry  Yo Kyle, I'm going miss that fat ass  When you shake that booty you could shatter glass  Remember when we were in the Six, popping xans?  I went down on my knees and palmed your ass  Uhhh DRIZZY"
Says what stat please point It out im seeing cp3 at age 36 still look great Kyle Lowry age 35 still look good Lebron age 36 only now looking like he‚Äôs declining. He wasn‚Äôt even that out of shape he was able to play fucking 40 minutes a game just like he always does that report was blown out of proportion because of one picture when he was in warmups üòÇ then the next week with the nets he looked skinny again.

Second unit is looking a bit directionless."
Kyle Lowry is an elite PNR player they absolutely will be running pnr
Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up shooter either
"There were three players over 33 who played significant roles on this years playoff teams: Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Lebron. They all had injuries in the playoffs. Goran Dragic, Carmelo, Joe Ingles, Gallinari were probably the next most significant contributors over 32 on playoff teams. Dragic had injuries late in the season. Gallinari had a playoff injury. None played over 30 minutes a game and closer to 20-25 minutes.   The list of guys 33+ who play 30+ minutes deep into the playoffs is a very short list. Lebron, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry 2 years ago at 33 are it really in the last few years.   The Lakers are going to have to be really smart to distribute the minutes. Teams are giving too much to some of these older guys in my opinion (not the Lakers necessarily since they‚Äôre 1 year deals mostly). We‚Äôre going to see some teams stuck on some contracts for guys who fall off the cliff."
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
I don't think adding a 35 year old Kyle Lowry is going to solve the issue that their two biggest stars can't shoot the ball.
"Obviously I don't watch them as much as my own team, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say that they underperformed as a team. Kawhi left and that sucks, but he didn't win that championship alone; the Raps have still had a pretty solid roster, and in what's supposed to be the weaker conference. You look at a vet PG improving a team like Chris Paul did with the Suns, and you'd expect that Lowry would have led the Raptors to a little more success the past two years.  I'm not arguing that Kyle Lowry = Chris Paul, but with how favorable the consensus opinion has been on the Heat acquiring Lowry has been (and compared to some of the mixed reactions to anybody acquiring CP3 for the last 4-5 years given his injury history and relationship with father time), you'd think he was supposed to be."
"More often than not it's to go to a team that's maxed out on the salary cap. Example the Heat/Kyle Lowry would never work traditionally as they're over the soft cap, but the sign and trade makes it work with various fine print exceptions   The other times are rare occasions where a player gets more dollars.  &amp;#x200B;  Basically it's all soft cap/hard cap manipulations. There are untold exceptions (like the mid level exception) that front offices have to build a roster"
"Can confirm, Kyle Lowry can not foot that bill"
One shot? Fate of the universe on the line? I. Want. Kyle. Lowry.
SIGN AND TRADE REGGIE JACKSON FOR KYLE LOWRY
It was reported by Kyle Lowry posting in his story saying he was going to Miami.   There hasn‚Äôt really been any official announcement other than Lowry‚Äôs contract amount and Dragic thanking Miami.
one of the reasons Jay Wright has most likely stayed at the college level https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-basketball/jay-wright-says-he-nearly-kicked-kyle-lowry-out-of-villanova-before-he-played-a-game
"Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, projecting Herro breaks out of sophomore slump, and honestly I think the team was fatigued as hell from the bubble playoffs."
Can Kyle Lowry play pg without FVV beside him is the real question.
"He also looked way worse on defense vs the Nets compared to the Bucks and Raptors. He didn't suddenly become worse as the stats imply, guarding Kyle Lowry or Brogdon/George Hill is different from guarding James Harden and Kevin Durant. Bobby Portis didn't suddenly become a better defender vs Atlanta and Phoenix, the matchup changed. Stats without context don't tell the whole story, the eye test without context doesn't tell the whole story either."
"Lowry is a 6 time all star, starting guard for a championship team. Do it all point, 3 level scorer with a pass/team first mentality, with unusually good defence, switchable on high post players. Despite his accolades I always felt Lowry was underrated his whole career.  I dont see Fred being *that* good. He is good tho, he will be an awesome PG for Toronto. You just wont have that high tier of a player in him compared to Kyle."
"no, kyle Lowry filled a pretty hefty hole. fred vanvleet will need to beef up if he wants to replace him fully"
"While he‚Äôs on the raptors, no fanbase will say he‚Äôs worth shit or that they want him. When he‚Äôs a free agent, he‚Äôd suddenly be worth a lot. Like Kyle Lowry.  But anyway the big knock on Van Vleet is that it‚Äôs become clear that he‚Äôs an undersized SG and will never be a PG."
"I went to play some b-ball, at the old ACC;  I went to chill with Raptors legend Kyle Lowry;  And at that moment when all of my dreams were in reach;  That big-ass Kyle Lowry took his talents to South Beach"
So you think a 35 year old Kyle Lowry is going to be in better shape than a 26 year old Kyle Lowry? Or a 31 year old Kyle Lowry? Or a 20 year old Kyle Lowry?  Doubt it.
It did. It was the correct strategy.  Paying 38 year old Kyle Lowry and 36 year old Jimmy Butler is not.
"Grizz are a smaller market, and have not won a chip yet. So there is that. But, there are a number of connections between Memphis and Toronto:  -- The NBA Grizzlies arent the first pro team in Memphis called the Grizzlies that relocated from Canada. In the 70s, a WFL pro football team relocated from ... Toronto, that was called the Northmen, but was nicknamed the Grizzlies. When they came to Memphis they became the Southmen, and kept the Grizzlies name too.  -- Several former NBA Memphis Grizzlies have ended up on the Raptors, including Matt Devlin, Kyle Lowry, and Marc Gasol. In return, former Raptor Jonas Valanciunas became a fan favorite in Memphis. And Memphis rooted strongly for Marc and the Raptors when they won their chip.  So root for both. If Toronto is the North, Memphis is the South."
"Poor Trudeau. When the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Montreal Canadiens he already lost the bet against Biden over the Stanley Cup Final.  Now he's losing Kyle Lowry to Florida, too."
"Yeah, they really had the world knocking on their door. 35 year old Kyle Lowry knew exactly who to call to get his money hahahah"
"That means a lot right?  A finals appearance, let's pay Kyle lowry until he's 38 hahahah"
"I think its fair to be skeptical about whether a 36 / 37 year-old Kyle Lowry, with his body type and at a position that doesn't always age well (especially in the post season)  will be a huge difference maker."
"Yeah, 36 y.o Kyle Lowry"
Imagine trading for Russell Westbrook but not Kyle Lowry lmao  Whoever is running the lakers Jesus Christ
"There are issues with the stats you're posting, but to be fair to you I was vague, so I'll get more specific.  I've come to determine Win Shares proper to be a worthless metric, as it tends to broadly overrate certain stats, and I remember a couple seasons ago it making out JaVale and Dwight's WS/48 to be near that of LeBron's.  BPM and its accumulative form in VORP are the best publicly-available all-in-one metric that I know of that only uses box stats, but it still only uses box stats.  TS, FTR, and TOV% are going to overlap for the most part with BPM/VORP.  The advanced metrics I've come to most regard are RPM and on-off per 100 possessions.  RPM's calculation is secret, at last check, but I believe that it predominantly uses +/-, and seemed pretty accurate with teams or players I've followed closely.  For instance it shows LeBron as having a much higher number than AD the past two seasons, which is accurate for anyone who watched the Lakers a lot, and you'd never be able to tell by looking at their box stats (which make them look mostly equal).  It's also made out Steph Curry to be especially good, and it showed when the Dubs last season won something like 60% of their games with him and went 2-8 without.  OOP100 can be jank even with an entire season's worth of games, and for role players generally, but DeRozan's predominantly played starter minutes and has been in the league a long time, and I'll be looking at a large sample size for him.  DeRozan's RPM the last 3 seasons in reverse-order is:  -0.83, -1.39, and -0.28.  His career OOP100 regular season is -2.8, with the last 3 seasons of 61-77 games each was even worse at -4.6 average.  That's.... awful.  Kyle Kuzma has a better OOP100.  Based on these numbers, the dude's not even properly worth an MLE to most teams.  I've barely watched the guy, but apparently there's a big empty-stats aspect to his game.  We weren't really arguing about Lowry, but I'll look up his like-numbers anyway.  His RPM the last 3 seasons is 4.02, 5.21, and 5.88.  Those are basically superstar numbers.  I won't cite his career OOP100 since he's getting old, but the last three seasons average:  +4.2 in 169 games.    DeMar's health has been better and he's younger, but +/- advanced metrics show that the two players that the two players are nowhere near each other in on-court impact, that Lowry's probably worth his new contract, and DeMar might be the most overrated player in the game."
"Unpopular opinion for our fanbase, but I don't think lowry was that good last year. Maybe he was phoning it in because of the circumstances, but having siakam as our secondary ball handler beside Fred actually looked better than when we started Fred and Kyle."
As is my kyle lowry 3 jersey
&gt;except Kyle Lowry isn't Chris Paul.  True. He has a ring.
Kyle Lowry: big booty exotic dancer
"I'd much rather be paying $25M to even a 35-37 year old Kyle Lowry than a random point guard who doesn't have championship experience or floor general experience. Kyle is one of the best PGs in the league, even at this age. The only problem could be injuries considering Kyle actually plays defence, but if he's healthy by playoffs your team is getting what they paid for.  Who else do you think falls into the CP3/Lowry mould that is available and worth the money?"
"No, teams are trying to copy what Chris Paul did with the Suns and he's profiting off of it except Kyle Lowry isn't Chris Paul."
Kyle Lowry too. I don't know why everyone here is acting like he isn't 35.
Here it is:   kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Brons toughest opponent until the finals that year was kyle lowry lmao. Just stop it
Kyle Lowry highest basketball IQ outside LeBron and CP3
"If we‚Äôre talking about the entire playoffs, the Cavs had too much of a cakewalk in the East to be a part of this conversation. The best player they faced in the Eastern conference that year was one Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan."
"I'd rather have a healthy Kyle Lowry than an injured Kyrie Irving.   I don't give a shit how good he is when he's missed more playoffs due to injury than he's actually finished.   Look, I had this conversation when he got traded to Boston. Boston fans down voted me and said the same thing you said.   Guess what happened. He missed the playoffs, and they did better without him than with him.   Then he signed with BK.   I said the signing was a mistake because Kyrie wouldn't likely not even be around for the playoffs.   People down voted me.   Guess what happened.   Then this, year, when people were saying that Nets were the odds on favorites, I said it was more likely that Kyrie goes down with an injury than they get to the finals.   I got down voted.   Guess what happened.   His finished the playoffs on the injury list.   Again.   Who gives a shit how fancy a dude can dribble when he's more likely to finish the playoffs on the injury list than playing?   His skills do no good for a team when he isn't on the court.   Period.   2015: Injured.   2018: Injured.  2020: Injured.  2021: Injured  That three years he played, and four years he missed.   He's currently more likely to missed the post season than finish it.   That's a reality.   Anybody who ignores that when trying to put a contender together doesn't deserve to be a GM.   The only rationale for signing Kyrie is to make sure you get KD, and not that he's locked in... well... you can cut Kyrie loose.      I'm not saying he isn't great. I'm saying it doesn't matter because you can't count on him being healthy."
"The NBA will investigate Kyle Lowry wanting to play with his best friend, but won‚Äôt investigate Mark Cuban fostering a culture of sexual harassment or Steve Ballmer sexually assaulting two people on live television."
"&gt;Lowry can make a decision to join Miami whenever he wants. That isn't illegal. Show me evidence where they put pen to paper a day before FA?   Because Kyle Lowry wasn't the one leaking his decision to join the Miami Heat, he was obviously in contact with your FO before FA began and someone there leaked it. The act of which is illegal."
The heat almost got Lowry at the deadline for this exact same deal. It doesn‚Äôt take a brain surgeon to come up with a frame work that works depending on the reported salary Kyle wanted. You bucks fans really are cops/Karens lol
"We go live to Miami where Kyle Lowry has reportedly been shot 7 times in the chest, the assailant who goes by ‚Äúbubble boy‚Äù was seen fleeing the scene"
Also two years ago their #1 target was Danny Green before he signed for the Lakers  Also this year it was Kyle Lowry  Also Cuban actually turned down taking on Dragic for free 2 years when Miami was trying to dump the contract to sign Jimmy Butler (they were able to dump Whiteside instead.)  People just see the narrative they want to see
Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no snitch
Kyle Lowry
Yeah like the headline was kyle lowry goes to miami lol. Lowry and heat couldve been talking before and the heat and toronto couldve been talking after the handshake was between lowry and the heat. Toronto has nothing to hide.
I had that same experience with Kyle Lowry in Houston. Then a few years later he became a consistent all star
"i think - and i'm by no means an expert, this is just what i've gleaned from reading r/nba the last few days - that free agency is supposed to be entirely free, even from the team you're with.  in the instance of kyle lowry and the raptors, the raptors were supposed to view the start of free agency as a day where they had no kyle lowry, and this is a business decision they made by not signing an extension with him previously (i guess extensions have to be signed a year in advance?)  so on the day free agency starts, every team in theory has a race to get in touch with kyle's agent and make offers. or in other words, an entirely equal competition between franchises."
"I would say Kyle Lowry, Jokic or Luka Doncic even if he's young this kid is a genius. They all have an insane basketball IQ."
It's like 95% Kyle Lowry
"In terms of actually making your team better, Kyle Lowry has been and is currently a better basketball player than Russel Westbrook. There has never been a year where I‚Äôd rather have Westbrook than Lowry."
"I think we wouldve opted into Goran either way. We either get Lowry and the Mle, or we get Goran and the mle, no? If thats wrong correct me, not super clear on Nba salary call.  But if this is the case, theyd get the mle either way and its just a case of Goran or Kyle."
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time.
Kyle Lowry?!
"On the Raps/Heat trade - dissecting bobby webster‚Äôs press comments, my guess at what happened:  1.	‚Å†Raptors learn they are getting the 4th pick. 2.	‚Å†Shortly after work with Kyle to get him to the team of his choice (miami), by allowing his agent to work with them prior to free agency opening. 3.	‚Å†Lowry finds a deal with Miami, but it would come at a cost of all/most of their cap space. 4.	‚Å†Miami opt-ins on Dragic in order to facilitate the S&amp;T, knowing Lowry is coming.  Raps + Miami could be in trouble here. As a raps fan, here‚Äôs hoping Masai / Riley didn‚Äôt make a stupid mistake knowing what happened to the bucks last year."
It‚Äôs official for the Heat  https://www.nba.com/heat/news/heat-acquire-kyle-lowry
Let‚Äôs dispel the myth Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt know exactly what he‚Äôs doing
"There's no way none of the other teams that have interest with Kyle to begin with wouldn't have reach out like Miami did on the first place. I don't think the Raptors would have moved Lowry to another team if he didn't approve of it. Lowry probably wanted to go to Philly, Miami or the Lakers which are 3 teams that wanted him during the trade deadline."

Starter once Adam Silver executes Kyle Lowry and Pat Riley for their tampering
"Kyle Lowry: ""I didn't do fucking shit! I didn't rig shit! I've been waiting a long time for a warmer climate"""
‚ÄúKyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up fool he ain‚Äôt gonna tamper in the corner like some player option bitch this ain‚Äôt Bogdan Bogdonavic this a fucking god human Kawhi Leonard come again only this time he ain‚Äôt a bitch sign a new fucking contract and get traded at the same time!‚Äù
Kyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up fool‚Ä¶!
Kyle Lowry knows what he‚Äôs doing
"It's very obvious that every, single signing that happens the second free agency opens up involves tampering, negotiating, and agreeing with the players before they were supposed to, but, for some reason, the Lonzo Ball and Kyle Lowry deals are the ones the NBA chooses to hammer down on."
"Kyle Lowry is one of the greatest glue guys you could ask for. And I feel like if you are a hardworking, competitive NBA player, Jimmy Butler is as well. He will be great for you guys.   Take care of my GROAT :("
Kyle Lowry is a veteran player who has openly wanted to be on the Heat for like 6 months. He wasn‚Äôt gonna sign anywhere else. Imagine punishing two teams for working together to get a veteran player to the team he wants to end his career with.
"&gt; According to Kevin O‚ÄôConnor of The Ringer, the Pelicans are desperate for free agent point guard Kyle Lowry with a fear of the Zion Williamson situation being the motivating factor in their plans.  Pelicans wanted Lowry, didn't get him. And they lost Lonzo."
"Good guy Kyle Lowry knew the Heat wouldn‚Äôt give up a pick by choice, so he tampered with them to ensure that the league gives Miami‚Äôs 2022 1st to Toronto"
Kyle Lowry better be good for the team and worth it for losing Dragon üò§  I hope he comes back next year to play with his brate again
We gave him the $84m deal as soon as we could just to lock him up but I think that Kyle Lowry was on the market and we obviously made an offer. He got mad and raised his price tag for being included in trade talks. My man bet on himself and flamed out
"Pat: ‚ÄúJimmy, we got Kyle Lowry‚Äù  Jimmy: ‚ÄúReally Pat? Do ya really mean it?‚Äù  Pat:‚ÄùYes but not without sacrifice. I think todays a good day for you to become a man. Call goran and tell him hes playing tor the raptors next year.‚Äù  Jimmy:‚ÄúPatrick‚Ä¶.üò¢‚Äù"
Both him and Demar Derozan had negative reputations and would get made fun of very often. Kawhi really did change **ALOT** surrounding Kyle Lowry
I think this is a disrespect to Mr. Big shot. Kyle lowry before Kawhi Leonard is known as a choker. His legacy is choke brothers. Then one run with kawhi leading the raptors change the narrative.
"There's been 4 games in the new format and they've collectively gone 0-5 there despite expecting a 50/50 outcome. Prior to that the East lost 3 in a row, with both Kyle/Jimmy appearing in 2 games and just Lowry in the final. The all star game one prior to Jimmy/Lowry's first appearance was the last time the East won"
"*2028, Raptors jersey retirement ceremony*  DeMar had retired earlier, and is returning to Toronto for the ceremony. Pre-game, Masai was prepared to raise DeRozan‚Äôs #10 jersey to the rafters in front of thousands of fans.  Then, all of a sudden.....  ***‚ÄùWAIT!!!!!!!‚Äù***  The crowd fell silent. From the masses, emerged one. The pasty chonker galloped towards the center of the court. He donned a Curry/Doncic dual jersey, embroidered with a /r/nba logo patch. Unfettered by the congregation of Raptors fans, he was determined..... to let people know the TRUTH!!!  He brandished a spreadsheet, filled out with data from basketball-reference and NBA advanced stats. Without saying a word, he merely gestured to the on-off net rating column.   The crowd let out a collective gasp. Masai was paralyzed by sheer astonishment. Kyle Lowry slowly shook his head, unable to process the facts and logic. DeMar‚Äôs jaw dropped, and a single tear slowly rolled down his cheek.   The murmurs among the crowd grew louder. Masai disappointedly shook his head, and lowered the jersey. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe we considered retiring his jersey.‚Äù The retirement ceremony was canceled. The Redditor softly chuckled as Lowry took DeMar behind the shed to execute him. Fans dropped to their knees, in awe at the sheer intellect they had just witnessed. ‚ÄúThank you, o Savior, for showing us the Truth!!!‚Äù He merely subtly nodded to the crowd, before leaping off into the night."
Kyle Lowry is the GROAT  Build him a statue.

"Yeah, it‚Äôll be tough to -  *Lowry forces a charge on my team*  MAN FUCK KYLE LOWRY!! FAT-ASSED MF!!"
Putting the Heat above them is laughable tbh.  The Hawks are more than 1 Kyle Lowry and 1 PJ tucker ahead of the Heat and their young guys are likely to have better years last year than they did this year.
Sources close to Kyle Lowry say the contract was loaded on the backend.

Kyle Lowry &lt;3
Even if you call the regular season as a wash it‚Äôs still hard to ignore what happened in the playoffs and I don‚Äôt think Kyle Lowry is that much of a difference maker.
They were a 6-5 seed before Kyle Lowry and all the upgrades in key areas (and a season where they were battered by Covid)...hard to imagine that they would stay exactly the same standing-wise.
Good thing Kyle Lowry isn't one...
"Kyle Lowry was around 15th in the NBA in minutes per game last year. Unless our plan is to intentionally tank, with Dragic getting rest days, he is likely going to play."
"Precious wasn't even in the discussions from what I remember, it was Dragic, Olynik, Duncan, and Nunn.   *‚ÄúMiami expressed interest in acquiring Raptors six-time All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry and Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk and Kendrick Nunn were discussed,‚Äù Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype reported recently.""*  https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/miami\_heat\_have\_made\_a\_kyle\_lowry\_trade\_offer\_to\_the\_toronto\_raptors/s1\_12680\_34352972"
"I am shocked that all the Raptors fans telling me that their team had the leverage to demand more from the Heat for Lowry were wrong.   It's almost like teams never actually get anything game changing in 90% of Sign and Trade deals.   Also, Raptor fans clearly don't understand relationships. There were so many ""Well, taking on Dragic will hurt our cap space. The Heat need to incentivize us so they can pay Kyle what he wants."" Do you know how badly it would look for the Raptors to essentially veto Kyle's decision because of cap space?"
"Yeah, once Kyle Lowry had his 0 point playoff game, I knew his career was over. So sad"
"Yup, I'm still hopeful he'll learn, he made a point of emphasis about it going into last season.   Part of the reason I hope he gets extended is that his value to the team won't be in question and he won't have to try and shoot so much in order to prove his worth in his next contract.   Obviously he's not as good, but similar questions were raised about Kyle Lowry when he was Smart's age, and he worked through them and got wiser as he got older."
"Because it‚Äôs been two years and he was injured for one of them you massive dumbass. Without Kawhi‚Äôs injury Clippers would‚Äôve been heavy favourites last year.  What has Kyle Lowry ever done without Kawhi? Fuck all, renowned playoff choker until he finally had a superstar to do it for him"
"In terms of peak seasons, Hayward in Utah or kemba in Charlotte (which were the points where they got signed in FA) were better than any version of Kyle Lowry.  Being a homer doesn‚Äôt mean that you need to be wrong.  And Lowry‚Äôs ‚Äúmeaningful basketball‚Äù was just being carried by kawhi to a ring vs a badly injured warriors team.   Just lol if you think Lowry has ever been anything more than a low tier all star."
Jrue Holiday is a Kyle Lowry type of playerü§î
"You're stripping this down to years played.  I'm looking at level of play.  You point to Ewing's contract, making a third of the cap. But you forget that the Knicks actually wanted to dump that contract because of Ewing's decline in level of play.   I'm not comparing a guy who signed a big deal in his prime and that last year of the contract was decline; I'm comparing guys who are already at that age of decline playing at a high enough level that teams are throwing a third of the cap space at them.   I'm talking Kyle Lowry getting nearly a third of the Heat's cap space. CP3 doing the same in Phoenix.   LeBron set to make nearly 50 mil at the age of 39.   These kinds of deals, in this volume, for players at this age in the NBA is not standard fair. Teams who are loyal to big ticket franchise players like Bird, Magic, Ewing. Sure. But a team dropping that kind of money on a 36-year-old free agent whose never played for them before? No.   In comparison, the Heat (same GM) only gave Tim Hardaway 2.5 mil a year back in 97, and Hardaway was 29 and considered to be on the down slope of his career by that time.    There's lots of examples. Mark Price. Kevin Johnson. Marbury. Francis. Earl Monroe played his best ball before 26 and made his last all-star game at the age of 32, even though he hung around a few more years.   Barkley was a shell of his former self after the age of 32. Hakeem was done as an All-Star by 35.   There is also the fact that the Bulls opted not to re-sign Pippen and Rodman after the 98 title because they thought they were too old.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm looking at Duncan, who was an All-Star at 38. Who made All-NBA and All-Defensive at 38.   At the Age of 36, with 15 years logged, Kareem dropped a less than 22/8/3 a game. At that same age with 18 years in the league, LeBron was dropping 25/7.7/7.8.   Nobody else was playing that well at that age back then outside of Kareem. And he managed to keep it up until 38 (at least scoring wise with 23 a game) before a noticeable slide.   But he wasn't tanking in the top five in any major statistical categories, like Paul and LeBron have over the last couple of years.   &amp;#x200B;  Sure, there have always been pine pickers like Charles Jones and Herb Williams kicking around until their 40, but that's not what I'm talking about here.   &amp;#x200B;  If you don't think that there are more players playing into their late 30s with significant roles and minutes than there have been in past generations, then we simply aren't talking about the same sport."
"&gt; Woz: ""I think the first one is, the Jrue thing... there's context here. The contract is coming up, they didn't want to pay him all the money the bucks would pay him when they thought the time line with zion was one thing, right?"" [...] That's how you see the whole, 'Alright, we're willing to pay 90 million for Kyle Lowry,' which was the market rate for the guy, but not give Jrue Holiday his 130 million dollar contract to be better and younger.  .  &gt; Simmons: ""How about keep Jrue Holiday and grab Myles turner a year ago and call it a day. That would've been nice.""  They're certainly not talking like people who understand that Jrue requested a trade."
"Yeah but last year we struggled to score and this off-season we signed Kyle Lowry, which is great, but that‚Äôs the only consistent scorer we got. And Oladipo is gonna be out till prolly Jan/Feb. We need 1 more consistent scorer to come off the bench. But yeah this off-season has been good af."
Has anyone seen Kim Kardashian and Kyle Lowry at the same time?
Kyle Lowry smiling rn
"Have you not paid attention to players forcing their way to teams at all in the past few years? No seriously like at all? Imagine its next offseason and Beal wants to go to Boston, or Beal wants out at the deadline. Its not even remotely inconceivable with trades James Harden, Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry in just the past two seasons."
"Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard carried that team. 0 bad defenders in that group."
"Nah man, Bill Russell didn't win because he had a better team, he won because he was the difference in making the players around him better. Like think of how we talk of Kyle Lowry, then put him on steroids and add in near Olympic level athleticism.  Like -- Russell won a championship as a player and a coach. At the same damn time. No one else did that. No one else got close."
Kyle Lowry
"Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, and Rudy Gobert come to mind."
"Miami.  They got the best player in FA in Kyle Lowry. But he's 35, and he didn't have a great year last year. Butler just signed a huge extension and he doesn't shoot 3s, and you have to imagine he's going to start declining soon. They don't really have great assets outside of Bam, and he's on a max, so I'm not sure how they get better. And even after making all of these moves, their ceiling is still lower than Bucks/Lakers/Nets. If Lowry keeps declining, Butler doesn't play like a max guy, then this team could look quite hopeless quite quickly. But they could look great. But there is the feeling of doom about them.  I think this upcoming year may be their only shot and even then I'd still have brooklyn/lakers/bucks over them."
"The same ones that got him to be a lottery pick, passing and court vision. The fact that Kyle Lowry wasn't a lottery pick proves my point even more. It's patently absurd to write off a point guard as ""likely out of the league"" after 26 games. Certainly it would have been far more likely for Lowry to be out of the league after his rookie year using your logic. Again, point being that proclaiming a point guard taken in the first round is likely out of the league after so little game time is ridiculous."
1. Ben Simmons  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Jamal Murray  4. Mike Conley  5. Fred VanVleet  6. Colin Sexton  7. Malcolm Brogdon  8. LaMelo Ball  9. D'Angelo Russell  10. Lonzo Ball
kyle lowry enters chat*
"You are one inch inside Kyle Lowry but Serge Ibaka is one inch inside you, which way you moving?"
1. Jamal Murray (assuming health) 2. Ben Simmons 3. Mike Conley 4. Kyle Lowry 5. LaMelo Ball (Hot take?: Will be #2 end of the season) 6. Malcolm Brogdon 7. Fred VanVleet 8. Collin Sexton 9. Lonzo Ball 10. D'Angelo Russell  I think its pretty cool that D'Angelo Russell is like the 20th best point guard in the league. We're really stacked at that position and should be for a long time since we seemingly get 1-2 franchise point guards in the draft each year.
"You have it backwards. He takes more shot attempts *because* he‚Äôs a better scorer. He‚Äôs not a better scorer *because* he takes more shot attempts.   &gt;So since Sexton averages 10 ppg than Simmons and Draymond, he is better than both of them now. That‚Äôs what u are making it sound like.   It‚Äôs not. You don‚Äôt understand how to compare aspects of basketball on a spectrum. According to you, this is how we should rank players.  Sexton - only good at scoring = 1 point   Lonzo - good at passing and defence = 2 points  Draymond - good at passing and defence = 2 points  Simmons - good at passing and defence = 2 points   Therefore all these players are better than Sexton. You aren‚Äôt understanding that the *degree* of how good they are is important. It‚Äôs not a binary on/off switch. Simmons and Draymond being DPOY level defenders isn‚Äôt the same thing as Lonzo being an above average defender. The level of ‚Äúgood‚Äù they are defensively holds a lot more weight than Lonzo‚Äôs level of ‚Äúgood‚Äù defence.   &gt;Lonzo overall is a better player than Sexton. When Sexton‚Äôs scoring is not available, what does he provide. When Lonzo‚Äôs 3 pt shot is off, he still gives u that playmaking and defense.  Let me ask you this. Are Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, and Kyle Lowry better than Kyrie Irving? They‚Äôre better at more things than him. When Kyrie‚Äôs shot isn‚Äôt available, what does he provide?"
1. Kyle Lowry 2. Jamal Murray (assuming he's healthy and up to what he was doing last season) 3. Malcolm Brogdon 4. Fred VanVleet 5. Mike Conley 6. Colin Sexton 7. LaMelo Ball 8. D'Angelo Russell 9. Lonzo Ball 10. Bum Simmons

Reminds me of when Kyle Lowry did the same  thing to the warriors in game 6 to open the final game in oracle before walking away with the nba championship
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"&gt;	And as for his shooting ability ‚Ä¶ in 2007, David Thorpe trained players on the campus at IMG (where WNBA players are now in the wubble). Why, Thorpe asked, was every single one of the good NBA balls chipped? Had they been used outside? No, came the reply. Kyle Lowry was here last summer. We shot a ton of corner 3s. He can‚Äôt shoot for shit, and hit the side of the backboard so much he damaged every single ball.  damn he‚Äôs come a long way lmao"
"@MagicJohnson Sep 9, 2020 &gt; I love watching Kyle Lowry play! I call him the Little General because of his toughness, leadership, scoring ability, basketball IQ, and will to win.  Little Generals, known for their scoring ability."
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
DeMar and Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka. I can‚Äôt choose which team I hate more so it‚Äôs a tie.
"Taller Kyle Lowry, shorter Nikola Jokic."
I'm a Heat fan. I want no part of Simmons on my team. Give me Kyle Lowry every time. Don't want a stubborn weirdo who refuses to shoot.
"This is literally the most brain dead argument ever, Siakam was on a team with Kyle Lowry and prime Kawhi where he could pick and choose his spots playing with two other allstar teammates lol. Julius  Randles second and third best players were 32 year old Derrick Rose and 21 year old RJ Barrett   Literally such a brain-dead argument."
We don't know the full details. Here's an article I found about it:  https://www.thedreamshake.com/2012/5/25/3044506/kyle-lowry-weighs-in-on-dispute-with-coach-kevin-mchale-his-future
That Kyle Lowry for Ben Simmons trade last trade deadline looks might good now. Daryl has overplayed his hand!!!! Enjoy scraps hahahahhaa
"Kyle Lowry was below 28% from 3 in 4 of his first 5 seasons, and averaging less than 10pts/game in each of the first 6 seasons he played.  Then he became a perenial all star and a 3pt threat flirting and even going over 40% from 3."
"Not sure if you could call it a mental block, but Kyle Lowry had a reputation as a locker room cancer and a coach killer in Houston, but turned around his image into the opposite, a professional and a leader. Apparently Masai had some talks with him that helped him change his mindset.  Fuck, I'm gonna miss Kyle this year, lol."
Kyle Lowry
"marcus smart, kyle lowry"
Kyle Lowry weighs more Brandon Ingram despite being 8 inches shorter
Was Kyle Lowry but now I don‚Äôt like anyone on that poverty stricken team lol. Other than that I‚Äôd have to say Tatum or Brown.

"It‚Äôs a whole new season bro. They have lottery picks ready to step up in cam and Dre hunter, and shooters in huerter and Bogi, hawks gonna be way better than last year. Heat got Kyle Lowry and everybody going crazy lol"
Yes this team is better than a team that had 1 month off and added Kyle Lowry
i was at game 3 of that series and it was insane bro. bron dominated and hit that crazy floater to win it  k love and korver had good games too  i remember demar played terrible and kyle lowry was unguardable the whole game lol
1. Edwards - finished the 2nd half of last season strong and has a coach that can utilise him properly  2. Tyler Herro - he had a down year last year after all the bubble hype and will have a bounce back year playing with his new teammate Kyle Lowry  3. SGA - has the green light on a poor Thunder roster   4. Mo Bamba - has showed a lot of promise in the preseason so far   5. Miles Bridges - will take another step and get great looks playing with Lamelo  6. Michael Porter Jr - he showed what he can do after Murray went down and he became the second option behind Jokic
They‚Äôre not: they‚Äôre the most overrated team in the NBA and Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry are two of the most overrated players in the NBA right now
"Kyle Lowry, if he hasn't regressed much from his last healthy form, is one of the best pgs in the league."
Kyle Lowry game 6 Boston
"I've been saying it's the Kyle Lowry drop-off season for like four seasons and he keeps turning in All-Star caliber campaigns. I thought Joe Johnson would both hang around longer and have a more established role. Was surprised to see him bounce around after Brooklyn, I really thought he'd end up coming off the bench for 10ppg on some team 'til he was 40."
Lmfao how the guy above u really say kyle lowry over nash
"True, you could see Kobe‚Äôs progression every year, so it‚Äôs not like he came out of nowhere. I was just thinking year 5 Kawhi was kind of similar to year 4 Kobe, but‚Ä¶ Kyle Lowry is the actual answer to the question. So I retract my statement."
"Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Kyle Lowry &amp; Khris Middleton"
Kyle Lowry
Some really good point guards.  - John Stockton - Kyle Lowry - Steve Nash  - Chauncey Billups
"kyle lowry.  it wasn't until he went to Toronto that he really got noticed.  although if you ask me, I think he was the same player in houston and they just didn't seem to want him...from what I remember at least.  Billups is another player.  bounced around before ending up in detroit"
"Kyle Lowry is a proven champion. Grayson Allen average 16 points on a team that barely made the play ins. And he shot on 54% efficiency while Kyle Lowry also shot on 54% efficiency, slow ass dude ü§£ü§£ü§£"
In the other hand +2 for it being kyle Lowry. He only tried to cripple Aaron Gordon for instance.
"Russ is in the same boat to me as Kyle Lowry. Probably better players at the position, but he will give it his all and play for the team. Kyle is probably better in that regard but I too would take Russ over Kyrie"
"Durant and Wade both run training camps for youth, that they attend.  I bet Kyle Lowry would run some awesome camps. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs in his interest though."

-2 points for one of the minority owners being a total douche and shoving Kyle Lowry
Definitely not Lowry esq on offense. Fred to date is still a pretty one dimensional offensive player. He doesn't really create for others at all. As opposed to Kyle whose one of the best playmakers in the league.
kyle lowry
"Kyle Lowry vs Russell Westbrook.  I'm not saying Lowry's better, but that it's a lot closer than you initially imagine, especially when you consider actual contributions to winning. Lowry: 960 games, 98.3 WS, 0.155 WS/48, 1 championship. Westbrook: 943 games, 104.8 WS, 0.154 WS/48, 1 MVP.   Counting stats included, WB blows him out of the water and will be a deserved shoo-in HOFer. Maybe what this shows more specifically, however, is that Lowry should also be strongly considered for the HOF. A final comparison: even though Lowry is 35 and WB 32, who do you think the Lakers would have rather acquired this offseason?"
"How else would a player be better? Kemba Walker has more in his bag, Kyle Lowry impacts winning more."
Gonna need more context than that :S  https://www.google.com/search?q=YA+YA+HEY+kyle+lowry+dame&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvLNQuy6AgLjaPveNfl6bj_TJM5YlA%3A1633833317108&amp;ei=ZVFiYe-EBoTez7sP7dGFgAk&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivy_Oz577zAhUE73MBHe1oAZAQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=YA+YA+HEY+kyle+lowry+dame&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKABOgcIIxCwAxAnOgcIIxCuAhAnSgQIQRgBUNTAAliFxgJg19cCaAFwAHgAgAH7AYgBsgiSAQUwLjEuNJgBAKABAcgBAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz
We were a much better team than you last year. We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier. You replaced Kyle Lowry with Goran Dragic.
"Fred last year (20/6/4) put up similar numbers as Khris Middleton (18/4/5), D'Angelo Russell (21/7/4), Kyle Lowry (19/7/5), and Kemba Walker (20/5/4) in years they were All Stars.    Fred is also one of the best guard defenders in the league and has shot 38% from 3 while taking 8 attempts per game over the past 2 seasons.    Fred is super underated and absolutely deserves to be called a fringe All Star."
Kyle lowry is worlds better at finishing. And even if it were true the raptors still lost their best player and locker room leader. And siakam is out for a chunk of the season.
"He definitely was during most of his Raptors tenure (excluding the championship year), but he wasn't last season.  And he missed a lot of games as well. There's also a multi-season sample of them playing pretty well in the games with VanVleet starting in place of Lowry.  The Raptors had Kyle Lowry last season, but they also had a ton of other things working against them as well. It's entirely possible that the impact of those factors regressing towards the mean will be greater than the loss of Lowry, especially if you remember that he didn't play that many games last year."
"Lowry drew 20 charges last year at #4 (and didn't play all that much). Kemba, Griffin, and Trez all drew 22 at 1/2/3.  Kyle was #1 in 2019/20, but 6th in 2018/19 with 23, and amazingly Marc had more in 3rd with 27.  Can't find stats for all time leaders."
Kyle Lowry and Guerschon Yabusele  Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/6T1upbx](https://imgur.com/a/6T1upbx)
"&gt; Basketball doesn‚Äôt work with 3 primary ball handlers  A lot of recent champions had 2-3 primary ball handlers.   2014 Spurs no question, all of them was in a system full of playmakers but if I had to be specific it was Tony, Manu and Diaw  2015 Warriors had Steph and Dray  2016 Cavs had LeBron and Kyrie  2017-2018 Warriors had Steph and Dray and KD occasionally  2019 Raptors had Kyle Lowry and FVV  2020 Lakers had LeBron (that's really all the playmaking they need) but Rondo shares the floor with LeBron tons of times  2021 Bucks had Giannis and Jrue. The Suns had DBook and CP3.   3 primary ball handlers is a good idea. And KD, Harden and Kyrie's defense isnt as bad as you think. Its not like they're a bunch of Trae Youngs or something."
Kyle Lowry is a perfect example of this people think he‚Äôs gonna break down for some reason. He‚Äôs one of the healthier point guards in the league with no major injuries
This dude is asking for more than Durant is worth for a player the caliber of Kyle Lowry. I love it üçø
"2017 John Wall would‚Äôve clapped Lowry‚Äôs fruity cheeks any day of the week. All-Defense, averaging 10+ assists, name one thing he did better. Kyle Lowry has to be the most overrated player I‚Äôve seen here holy shit."
"I never heard a viral rap song about doing no ""Kyle Lowry"""
"Kyle Lowry &gt; John Wall, even in his prime"
"1. Kyle Lowry and Goran are the same age 2. Every team goes through player decline 3. Every team had sucky injuries 4. Every team had COVID stuff 5. Yeah short offseason, but you can't say that was the key reason for the sweep."
"Lowry can score if you need him to and he is a very decent 3 point shooter. He also will make Bam a better scorer. And don't be surprised if you see a jump in Herro's play as well. If you have some young guys that need a push to the next level, Kyle is your guy."
"The Toronto Raptors, with its national history tied to the NBA will never be respected. Till this day I still shop at the first official NBA game ever(Loblaws, a major Canadian grocery chain). People really forget that Chris Paul doesn't have an NBA ring and Kyle Lowry does. Raptors never lost a finals game In America but does that ever matter? NBA gets an F for showcasing its international teams. Can't replicate Vancouver in modern NBA. Why would London ever be a choice or AUS? Think about it, you favourite player most likely doesn't have a ring and yet he's being paid more than 30M."
"I just find it funny that's all man, it's really not too deep. Of course I'm going to laugh at division rivals misfortune. It would be the same of Lowry Walked for nothing, ppl would be clowning Masai.  On your point, that's what Lowry says, who knows if this the truth. I really doubt a guy competitive as Lowry was perfectly ok staying in Tampa with a garbage team when there were 3 playoff teams interested. Also if Kyle said yea I'm staying, I really doubt Masai is asking for trade proposals still. That would be a big PR hit regardless what he got back. It's different then DeMar since Lowry literally helped bring the only legitimate championship Toronto has had in over 2 decades"
"This is the season that'll turn the Lowry story from ""is he really a Hall of Famer?"" to ""Kyle Lowry is first ballot Hall of Fame."""
"Beating Al Horford and Paul Milsap, Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, and young PG and Roy Hibbert.  Context please.  Shaq had to go through Duncan and the Spurs, Dirk's Mavricks, Webber and the Kings, Nash and Stoudemire, prime KG, Pippen's Blazers.  All of those teams were better than anything Lebron faced during his 8 straight Finals.  Shaq actually had competition before the Finals.  Lebron did not.  Lebron's Finals run is one of the most overrated accomplishment in sports history."
"What exactly is Simmons' perceived value? For reference, here are 3 offers that other GMs rejected from Morey:  1. OG Anunoby, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, 4th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft  2. Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft, and 2 future first round picks  3. CJ, three first round picks, and three swaps  I'm not entirely sure what dangerous precedent is hanging in the balance here but it seems that other GMs cant see eye to eye with Morey's perception of Simmons' perceived value."
"I'll never forget Joe Johnson on a ""stacked"" Brooklyn team averaging 15.8 PPG making the all-star team over Kyle in 13-14. Not only did he have worse stats, their team also finished with a worse record than the Raptors. Sure, they beat us in the 1st round on a block by Paul Pierce, but the mental gymnastics people were going through to pick him over Lowry was fucking jokes."
Bruh this is Kyle fuckin Lowry we're talking about. Who actually thinks hes not individually dynamic?  He might be passed his prime but there isn't a single team in the league where he wouldn't make the team better.
Wow!! TIL. Thanks for educating me. I'm a Warriors fan but I absolutely love Kyle Lowry (even through the 2019 finals) and think he's a fantastic player.
"Kyle Lowry got a ring and a fat ass, most of these thots can‚Äôt relate"
What does Jimmy have to do with that? From when Butler checked into the game with 6:47 left:  * 6:32 - Tyler Herro missed 3PT Shot * 6:24 - Tyler Herro floating jumper * 5:55 - Kyle Lowry Free Throws * 5:20 - Tyler Herro jump shot * 4:53 - Kyle Lowry turnover * 4:18 - Tyler Herro turnover * 3:38 - Caleb Martin missed 3PT Shot * 3:13 - Bam Adebayo missed shot * 2:44 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 2:13 - Caleb Martin missed layup. * 1:47 - Jimmy Butler free throws * 1:11 - Jimmy Butler jumpshot * 42.9 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 17.6 - Tyler Herro free throws * 10.4 - Jimmy Butler free throws  Jimmy was in the game almost 4 minutes before he had a possession finishing action. A big problem with Miami down the stretch was that the offense wasn't funneling through Butler for large stretches of the 4th until he decided to take control of the situation once the lead shrunk very small.
"Kyle Lowry triple double, all is right with the world"
Kyle Lowry Triple Doubleeeeeeeeeee
Heat Legend Kyle Lowry
Let us all hope that we get blessed with the Kyle Lowry Triple-Double this fine Saturday night.
And it was warranted. The Raptors were a poverty franchise until 2019 and now they pretty much dominate the media. If Kyle Lowry took a shit it was front page immediately.
Im a knicks fan but purely talent wise Cam Reddish is more talented than RJ. He isn‚Äôt as good a player but just raw talent he has him beat.   JR Smith is also more talented than a guy like Kyle Lowry but talent only takes you so far.
"Jimmy Butler doesn't have to shoot 3s because he's surrounded by Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson and Kyle Lowry. The team built a system around Jimmy Butler's strengths and weaknesses and are successful because of it.   If you put Jimmy Butler back on the 76ers, they probably wouldn't be as good even though Embiid and Simmons are probably more talented than anybody on the Heat."
Maybe Kyle Lowry but without the longevity.
It makes me think of that insane inbounds from Kyle Lowry a couple of seasons ago.
It was kyle lowry no?
It's a Kyle Lowry pasta you heathen
Praying this was a Kyle Lowry to the Knicks moment where the trade he *didn't* make pans out best haha

I mean sure but you can‚Äôt really continue owning a team if you had no success against them afterwards 3 years later.   If anything Kyle Lowry owns the Lakers lol
"&gt; I can see why you would feel that way but Wood is a late bloomer and he's still developing almost like a Kyle Lowry type.  Yeah and I'm not saying that to be negative, overall I think Wood is a very good player.  I just think offensively he tunnel visions too hard and he's an underwhelming passer, often times favoring a mediocre shot for himself as opposed to passing it out for potentially a better shot for someone else.  &gt; Also, KPJ is still learning how to be a point guard so I would give him some time.  Which is why I said I hope one of them does.  I see some really good glimpses of PnR playmaking but it's REALLY inconsistent and his scoring still leaves a lot to be desired.  Obviously he's young, that can (and likely will) change with age, but at some point it becomes about actually winning a decent amount of games and with Wood being 26, I'm willing to bet that's sooner rather than later (probably within 3 years IMO)"
"I can see why you would feel that way but Wood is a late bloomer and he's still developing almost like a Kyle Lowry  type.   Also, KPJ is still learning how to be a point guard so I would give him some time."
Interesting question...maybe Kyle Lowry? De'Anthony Melton? Jrue Holiday?  Seems like a good topic for r/nbadiscussion
Ah gotcha.. that‚Äôs kinda sounds like a big Kyle Lowry which would be incredible
"You are mistaken, Kyle Lowry plays for the Denver Nuggets."
It‚Äôs just true by any reasonable metric that Chris Paul is still the better player. I‚Äôm not sure what everyone else has been watching even dating back to last season but Kyle Lowry has slowed down a bit. For being touted as a winning player the Raptors sure lost a lot of games last year when he was starting.
Any word on Kyle Lowry and Jaylen Brown?
I hate Kyle Lowry but I hope he is okay. Never want to see a player hurt.
TWELVE POINTS. KYLE LOWRY ISNT A SPOT UP SHOOTER
Kyle Lowry was the only big difference maker that moved and its definitely paid off for Miami.
Kyle Lowry
"[Here](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/10/29/22753097/kyle-lowry-miami-heat-jimmy-butler-good-start) is a very good write up on his impact on the Heat offence so far if you actually care to read one. Herro definitely deserves credit for his improvement, but Lowry has been masterful at finding everyone in their spots and that includes Herro."
This is my obligatory ‚Äúy‚Äôall gave us Kyle Lowry so I gotta hype up your team‚Äù post.
Need Kyle Lowry to start streaming
"Kyle Lowry is a massive addition, Bam seems improved as expected, Herro off to a great start. That‚Äôs a team that will not beat themselves"
Cause Kyle mutha fucking Lowry. He pushes the pace offensively and is an anchor on defense. I am glad the world is seeing why we Raptors fans love this dude and dat booty of his so much.
"No dude, he wasnt like this as a pg in college. All of what youre seeing now are improvements. Hes been playing pg for us for years( even tho dominantly used as a sg, he struggled playing actual pg when given the opportunity)when hes the primary ball handler on the court if no lowry is there and couldn't do the above specific actions I mentiomed above. Dont be fooled man. Theres been so many possesions even when kyle and fvv share the floor and we had lowry play off ball while fvv initiates and it was awful. Fvv was terrible hitting the roll man ibaka while not playing off ball with no lowry on the court"
"I mean he used to play PG back in college so I'm not surprised he has been doing well. Don't forget once he moved to a starter role alongside Kyle, he played much more of an offball shooting game. He's also had to figure out the chemistry with this squad. Remember that Lowry didn't really make his PG game better till he was Fred's age."
Let's give some first fortnight awards.  * MVP of the first two weeks - Jimmy Butler * DP of the first two weeks - Jimmy Butler * 6M of the first two weeks - Tyler Herro * MIP of the first two weeks - Tyler Herro * RO the first two weeks - Scottie Barnes who's from West Palm Beach and probably was a Heat fan as a kid * CO the first two weeks - Eric Spoelstra * EO the first two weeks - Pat Riley * Teammate of the first two weeks - Kyle Lowry
The Kyle Lowry special
"It's not all about the quality of players.  Salary and years are more important to teams.  Prioritizing salary and years allows you to take big swings in free agency where you can, theoretically (but not in Dallas), get something big for nothing in return.    Even if the Mavs kept Seth instead of trading him for Richardson, they would have just traded Seth before this season because they needed the cap space to pursue Lowry (and because they didn't want to attach a 1st to Powell to get off his salary, plus they value Maxi too much to dump him for a free agency gamble).  The Mavs expected Richardson to play well enough to opt out of his contract for this season, thus clearing enough space to sign Lowry.  Instead, Richardson opted in and they got Moses Brown back.  So the Mavs chose Tyler Bey, Moses Brown, and a non-zero chance at Kyle Lowry over Seth Curry and no chance at Kyle Lowry.  That's a neutral trade and certainly not one of the worst trades in the last decade."
"I can almost guarantee I‚Äôve been watching longer than you have. The old joke was Toronto has 3 O‚Äôs but no D.   We can talk about the year Derozan and Lowry took the raps to the ECF. 2016 we had a great bracket, played a 45-37 Pacers team and then a 48-34 Heat team (Dragic and old Wade were the best players on this team). That was the only year the Raptors made the ECF with Demar.  On top of that, was he even our best player? IIRC the players making the clutch shots was Kyle. Demar had 20 pts/game on 46% TS. This is horrendous. Kyle on the other hand had 18 pts/game on 51% TS + all the other things he provides such as playmaking and defense. TS is still not great, but he was def our best player during that run.  Gtfoh calling other people casuals when you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre talking about. I love demar and will always love him, but Siakam was better for us than Demar was in a Raptors uniform. DeMar has definitely gotten better while at the Spurs - but that‚Äôs not really what we‚Äôre talking about here, is it?"
"Ok so who does dame have on his team that compares to Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, manu, Kyle Lowry, pascal, Middleton, Jrue, Jason kidd, Tyson chandler, the list goes on and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
Kyle Lowry pushing the pace on free agency. Really quick decision making from our T H I C C point guard
"Kyle Lowry is doing for the Heat what I thought/hoped Lonzo would do for the Bulls. Instead, he just sits in a corner while Lavine and Derozan dribble and score."
Freddy has truly become the team's spiritual successor to Kyle Lowry these last few games. Dude has the heart of a champion.
I don't got enough filament to 3D print me a Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry last year would have been huge too.
"This Kyle Lowry guy is pretty good, who knew?"
Are you trying to tell me that Kyle Lowry was always going to sign to play with his friend Jimmy Butler and wasn‚Äôt interested in teaming up with Fat Albert and getting the piano played for him by David Griffin?
I said the same about Kyle Lowry. I‚Äôd imagine he gets similar money.
Kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"You wouldn't download Lonzo Ball or Kyle Lowry, would you?"
Most recently seen with Kyle Lowry lol
"The heat being good now does not disprove they were ""bubble frauds"". They added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker and Victor Oladipo. While also taking away Goran Dragic, Precious Achiuwa and Kendrick Nunn. They aren't the same team anymore."
I was afraid we gonna be ass in transition bc Bam is the only athletic guy and we don‚Äôt have any marksmen other than Duncan and Kyle Lowry but our passing that lead to transition buckets been stellar.. Lowry and Butler just been hitting touch downs like they been playing with each other for seasons now
"I knew Kyle was good, but honestly seeing him being a true definition of a floor general, and motivating our guys and keeping them on track, it is truly a fucking thing of beauty to watch. When he is on the floor, no one ever looks panicked or anxious or in a hurry, he is always keeping the guys calm, always indicating the next thing to do. We fucking LOVE ourselves some Kyle Lowry now. We will treasure and honor him."
"Dejounte is just a younger, slightly better Smart, he wouldn't change anything.   A Kyle Lowry type would be perfect. Personally, my top choice would be Brogdon but he can't be traded this year."
The Kyle Lowry Effect.
"&gt;What do the stats say that I disagree with?  That CP3 has any sort of scoring advantage over Lowry, which was the point of your original comment.   &gt;The suns success also saw immense contributions from Chris Paul, both in the regular season and playoffs.   Interesting. So the season prior when Lowry led his team to 53 wins and the second best record in the conference, was he then the better player? Team success matters after all.   Or maybe basketball isn‚Äôt played 1 v 1 and having good teammates affects team record?   &gt;Lowry wasn‚Äôt a 3 level scorer and he did his scoring over a smaller sample in the regular season on a lotto team.  We have half a decade of Lowry being an *efficient* scorer on high seeded teams. To act like he‚Äôs just chucking away on a lottery team is disingenuous.  Kyle Lowry and Chris Paul were equal level scorers last season and the numbers back that up."
Rare footage of u/Cudizonedefense encountering[ Kyle Lowry in the streets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1yD-g7Tuq4)
"Because if you watched games you'd see that it wasn't just a marginal improvement as the stats suggest. Kyle Lowry for instance averaged basically the same assists numbers since his Houston days, but has improved tremendously as a playmaker throughout that period.  Demar for instance has become a much better playmaker in SA despite averaging essentially the same assists numbers as he did in his last season in Toronto.  But yeah, saying a player has absolutely peaked in his 4th season is just stupid."
Feels nice having an additional fanbase appreciate Kyle Lowry for all the non stat line things he contributes
I'm surprised they didn't go at Lowry harder at the trade deadline or free agency. Feels like he would've been a perfect fit next to Luka. Though maybe Kyle really did want to play with his homeboy Jimmy more than anything else.
"You can analyze all the information available, make the best decision in the moment, and still be wrong in hindsight.   It‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood decision‚Äù statistically to hit when you have 12 in blackjack, but obviously you can still bust‚Ä¶ is it a good decision if you get a 9, but a ‚Äúbad decision‚Äù if you bust? Maybe? But it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre stupid for hitting on a 12.   Regardless, in his time as Sixers GM he hasn‚Äôt made a single bad decision that I know of.   - Traded Richardson for Curry - Traded Horford for Green - Re-signed Kormaz - Tried his best to trade Ben for Harden last year (Houston refused the better trade package) - Drafted Maxey - Refused to trade Maxey for 1 year of an obese and elderly Kyle Lowry   Even in hindsight, while running the Sixers I can‚Äôt think of a single bad decision‚Ä¶ Maybe signing Dwight Howard was his worst decision. if you have one please feel free to share."

Kyle Lowry is with the heat now?! I only learnt that right now
"Idk, Kyle Lowry best QB in South Florida right now.... 2nd best in the state even."
"Shit, even making the HOF at all would be a amazing achievement for a guy like Lowry, he was bouncing around the league with a bad attitude for couple years before Toronto got him and he matured. Kept getting better, and helped lead a team to a championship (Kawhi was the best but Kyle led the team), and became a multiple time all star."
"Kyrie is only great at scoring and setting up people off the dribble. He ain't a better play maker, floor general, defender, and leader than Lowry. Dude couldn't even lead a little bit or make his team better when he was the guy in Cleveland or Boston. Kyrie is more of a 2/3rd option scorer on a champion team like Kyle but I'd rather have Lowry literally any day of the week cause he'll give you 15, 8 assists, defense and charges every game."
"- Tyler Herro (currently averaging 22.4/6/4.4, leading bench scorer in the NBA)  - Duncan Robinson (extended, enables extensive spacing for two stars who can't shoot even if he's in a slump)  - Precious Achiuwa (used in trade to acquire Kyle Lowry)  - Kendrick Nunn (let go for nothing)  - Salary Filler (would've likely been Goran Dragic &amp; Andre Iguodala, one of which was used in the Lowry trade)  - Two 1st-Round Picks (likely 2022/2024)  - 4 Pick Swaps   this is the king's ransom they asked for Harden."
"the point is that james harden's net impact would not have made up for the loss of all houston wanted for him (that we **DID NOT HAVE ANYWAY**)   now, it's nearly a whole season later -- james harden is struggling, precious achiuwa and goran dragic (**TWO PIECES WHO WOULD'VE LEFT FOR HARDEN**) were exchanged for kyle lowry (who has been phenomenal), and tyler herro is having a breakout year -- not to mention the picks we managed to hold onto that houston wanted  miami won the hypothetical"
fuck the heat but kyle lowry is good
We could have had Kyle Lowry but ended up getting westbrick RIP championship aspirations
Kyle Lowry can fit me anytime.
nah mate  I think someone pasted this in some kyle lowry off-season thread
"Listen, I love Kyle just like you but Raptors got this chip this year! But if we got knocked out, hell yea‚Ä¶ Lowry all the way!"
Kyle Lowry is the better POINT GUARD. Irving is the better player.  &amp;#x200B;  There's a reason why the Nets slid James Harder over to be their point guard. Irving is a scorer first and foremost.
"https://www.businessinsider.com/houston-rockets-kyle-lowry-battery-female-referee-2012-1  The declaration of warrant/summons said, ""At the end of the game, Lowry approached the victim and threw a basketball at her striking her in her torso. The victim picked up the basketball and tossed it back at Lowry. Lowry became upset and stated, 'B****, meet me outside. I will kick you‚Äôre a**'.""  I guess hit a girl is a generous term, but hit a girl with a basketball and threatened her"
"Besides Kyle Lowry, damn if herro isn‚Äôt backing his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trae and luka and ja level‚Äù shit up. I mean obviously not to that degree but he‚Äôs playing well"
"Finally another fanbase is understanding who the fuck is Kyle Lowry, put some respect on my man name!"

Fvv  Cwood (undrafted hardly made our team had to beat out joe Johnson)  Sadiq bae  Stewart  Kyle Lowry   I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a few , and he‚Äôs a good player coach. I will agree however I haven‚Äôt been a fan of his lineups thus for into the season. So if it continues I‚Äôll change my opinion on him"
The Kyle Lowry effect. Take good care of him Heat fans.
People were saying Kyle Lowry can do everything CP3 can nowadays lmaoooo
Kyle Lowry may go down as one of the most universally beloved players ever.
Kyle Lowry is the solution.
"I share your enthusiasm, but I‚Äôm also gonna be really honest here. Kyle Lowry is not better than Kyrie Irving. Better PG? Absolutely (Look no further than Kyrie vacating his position to Harden last season). However, Kyrie Irving is a special, special basketball talent."
Morey picked George Hill over Kyle Lowry to leverage (tank) the present and future just to have $35M/year go AWOL

Kyle Lowry Over Everything
Kyle Lowry *WAS* a Toronto Raptor   ***cries myself to sleep***
The Kyle Lowry build.
"I just need to talk to someone about how good the Heat are. Jimmy could honestly finish top 5 in MVP voting, Herro has made a leap and Bam looks like a top 10-15 player. If you get bubble Jimmy, all star Bam, heat check Herro and vet Kyle Lowry, that‚Äôs a finals team."
"""Kyle Lowry is known for his gritty defense""  And CP3 isn't?  My whole point is that Lowry does a lot of things well but CP3 does them better  You aren't really disputing that  I get people hate CP3 but come on"
Kyle Lowry with an actual lob threat is scary. Shame he never had that in Toronto
I don't know what you're smoking. Kyle Lowry is known for his gritty defense. Like why is a guy with a flair from a team that doesn't exist anymore acting like he even watches games.
Ignore my flair bias but Kyle Lowry is a god. He should have made like 5 all defense teams but he never did because he never campaigned for it.   Kyle Lowry willed us into having the second best record in the league after a superstar level player walked away for free and almost single handedly beat a good Celtics team despite Pascal selling   Kyle Lowry was the 2nd best player on a championship winning.  GROAT
Kyle Lowry.
Kyle Lowry and his big beautiful booty
KYLE LOWRY AIN'T NO SPOT UP SHOOTER HE AINT GOTTA RUN TO THE CORNER TO SHOOT LIKE HES SOME 3RD OPTION BITCH THIS AINT JJ REDICK  THIS IS A FUCKIN  GOD HUMAN STEPH CURRY COME AGAIN ONLY THIS TIME HES NOT A FUCKIN PUSSY PULL UP FROM THE FUCKIN LOGO AND FIGHT YOU AT THE SAME TIME
"Hello i am here to talk about ass I've explained this time and time again. The argument of boobs vs ass must be explored more deeply than a simple comparison of preference. It needs to be broken down further. Let me explain.  Boobs and butts are both secondary sexual characteristics. Boobs, insofar as natural growth, are like penises: The size you get is the size you are stuck with, barring medical enhancement. Similarly, a nice ass is primarily the product of the waist-hip ratio, as well as muscle size, the latter of which can be improved to a reasonable extent.  Now the question is this: In terms of bare necessities, being, if you had to choose between a girl with no tits and a perfect ass, or no ass and perfect tits, what would you choose? Think about that for a second. It is an undeniable fact that while there are certain groups within the male population that appreciate and even exclusively seek flat chested women, can the same be said about pancake asses? Does a man ever really PREFER a woman with no ass and the lower body of a rectangle? I would strongly deny any such statement. However, if we reframe the question as: which body part has the highest marginal gains in sexual appeal, and by that I mean, if you were to be guaranteed an average ass but extraordinary breasts, or an extraordinary ass but average breasts, which has the highest potential for sum total sexual appeal? It gets trickier. Obviously, an average ass is just fine. It gets the job done, it exists, and to an extent it satisfies a baseline need. As an ass reaches towards a platonic ideal, I am of the belief that it caps fairly quickly. There is no nipple, no axial tilt, no significant cleavage variance.  With the breasts, the story changes quite significantly. There are so many more factors at play. Size of the nipple, height of the nipple, ratio of nipple size to areola, perkiness of the breasts, height of the breasts, and so much more. Therefore, I believe that the platonic ideal of the breast is of much greater marginal value as it approaches perfection, compared to the perfect ass.  TL;DR: All things average, breasts have more potential in terms of marginal gains, all else being average. However, when faced with the dilemma of one or the other, the ass is a baseline necessity.   Hence, Kyle Lowry is the GOAT."
I thought that was Kyle Lowry?
"AD remains the most unimpressive first option for a ""star"" in the current NBA and probably in the history of the NBA. Of the top 11 players, he is clearly the worst first option. Even after that, Butler, PG, Russ, Beal, CP3, Dwight, Melo (lol even Melo), Beal, Donavon Mitchell,  Kyle Lowry, Jason Tatum, Demar Derozan, Trae Young, Devin Booker and John Wall have had more success than AD as the first option.  It's fucking ridiculous that I can name 25 players with better success as a first option than a ""TOP 75"" player ever"
"Kyle Lowry, Rondo, Iggy"
gawd damn I did not know about this kyle lowry thicc asf
"&gt;Including 5 offensive rebounds, which is insane for a 6'1 player  Is it? I guess as a Raps fan we've been spoiled. Kyle Lowry is a generous 6 foot and has averaged 5+ boards a game for the past 3 seasons and over 4.5 for the past 11 seasons. FVV is also a generous 6 and has averaged 5 this season. Always felt boards were more about positioning and heart than height."
"I like the clippers, but whats stopping kyle lowry from getting a layup on reggie?  Edit  they also couldve called timeout and drawn up a final shot play."
"Unlike the Heat, that need to rely on cats like Bam Adebayo and Kyle Lowry."
Tatum is bad about this no doubt‚Ä¶. but have you watched Kyle Lowry play? Also Nick Nurse legitimately looks blown away at 100% of the calls that don‚Äôt go his way- literal disbelief for 48 minutes haha.
"Showing up to a game, taking a picture of a players ass and sharing zoomed in photos of it is weirdo shit. Full stop.  Thinking it's okay because other people on the internet say it's cool means you need a break from social media.  Kyle Lowry is a human person with kids and a family"
Kyle Lowry went nuts!
"&gt;Kyle Lowry is a god.  This is still so weird to see with the flair, fuck"
Kyle Lowry ain't no spot up shooter
"Kyle Lowry is not only a god, he‚Äôs the GROAT"
"Best: ball movement, Kyle Lowry has done so much to help us.  Worst: our shooters are seemingly all going through slumps at the same time so our 3 point shooting has been kind of cheeks lately outside of a couple of games."
Kyle Lowry and his dumptruck frighten me
living legend Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry tho
"I slightly get why, because they wanted him to take the 3 probably but still, You don‚Äôt give it to Kyle Lowry, one of the best inbound passers In the whole league lol."
Kyle Lowry stat lines now?
Kyle Lowry can't win with these cats.
Getting harder and harder not to be mad at Duncan.  Kyle Lowry is a god.  GG Clips.  PG for MVP
i would like to never face kyle lowry again thank u very much goodbye
Kyle Lowry is a fucking god
Fucking Kyle Lowry! Why didn't we trade for him?
Kyle Lowry my goodness
NBA champion Kyle Lowry
"From the sounds of his, Kyle didn't want to get traded and masai told him he won't trade him unless a really good deals comes along.  But also if the sixers have Lowry, they make it to the conference finals and maybe make the finals."
"It's a good thing Kyle Lowry ain't no spot-up shooter, or we'd be in trouble."

Fuck I wanted Maxey big time when the Kyle Lowry rumors were swirling last deadline but the dude is showing why Philly wasn't gonna let that shit fly. Dude is a baller

OG ‚ÄúKYLE LOWRY‚Äù ANUNOBY
"Kyle Lowry absolutely makes this Sixers team much better last year and this year, so the non trade is probably a lose-lose scenario."
Miami has the scariest defense in basketball when you consider PJ is probably their 3rd best defender and Kyle Lowry is their 4th
Kyle Lowry. Thicc.
When do you think Lowry got good? Because it honestly wasn‚Äôt until like 2014. He wasn‚Äôt even a full time starter until like 2011 or 12 and he wasn‚Äôt NEARLY as good as he is now until 2015. And he was horrific in the playoffs up until 2017. Like legitimately terrible and there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs ever been good enough to fill the role Westbrook had to play in OKC. Kyle is not giving you the 27 and 11 that Russ averaged in 2016. And they needed every single part of those numbers to be competitive because the roster was as top heavy as any team the last decade.
I think in the realm of Kyle Lowry during his prime (whenever that was‚Äînow?). They‚Äôre both two-way for generals and floor raisers.

Shouts to fucking Kyle Lowry as hell dude played his ass off and he was menace. Also when tf did PJ Tucker become an athletic freak lol. Nah but seriously that was a good as game. That my heart definitely didn‚Äôt need lol
Kyle Lowry better ü•±
Kyle Lowry would've swished all of those shots and got 3 assists so who's really a top 75 all time player?
Miami choking hard. Kyle Lowry needs to shoot the damn ball.
"why is kyle lowry afraid to shoot, hes just looking to pass the blame to every other player, be a leader"
"KYLE ""0 points"" LOWRY"
I‚Äôm still taking him over Kyle 10 Point Lowry.
THEY SAID KYLE ‚Äú10 POINT‚Äù LOWRY WAS BETTER THAN THIS MVP.
"Kyle Lowry, you crafty mf you üòè"
Kyle Lowry needs to actually try and score the basketball.
Kyle Lowry doesn‚Äôt dive.
Bulls game plan on who to attack after game:   **ATTACK**  Jokic  **BOX AND 1**   Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Dewayne Dedmon  Bam Adebayo
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
I mean Kyle Lowry wasn't an All-Star until 28. Steve Nash averaged 7 and 4 until he was 26 and then was an All-Star at 27. Billups at 28. etc      It happens. To say Myles is what he is at 25 when he's shown improvement under the best coach we've had since Myles was a rookie is kinda wild.
"The statements about Kyle Lowry in the media this year show that this was him until he joined Miami. Personally I'd say Fox, I know he's fast and thats about it."
Obviously I know him now but when I played 2k12 the Rockets were always trying to trade some dude named Kyle Lowry for a decent return and I was always confused why I had never heard of him
"Yo OP, your tables are a little messed up. If you put --- | --- | --- | --- between the header and the rest of the table, it will change it into a much better looking version:  Player|2021-21|2020-21|Diff ---|---|---|--- Damian Lillard|3.2|7.2|-4 Bradley Beal|4|7.7|-3.7 Trae Young|5.3|8.7|-3.4 Collin Sexton|3.5|6.4|-2.9 James Harden|4.6|7.3|-2.7 De'Andre Hunter|1|3.7|-2.7 Kyle Lowry|1|3.5|-2.5 Kemba Walker|1.2|3.5|-2.3 Donovan Mitchell|3.9|6|-2.1 Joel Embiid|8.6|10.7|-2.1  Well, I had to change the spaces between the numbers into | but it looks better that way, and you can even sort it based on the column"
Kevin Durant doesn‚Äôt lose to Kawhi Leonard. Kyrie Irving doesn‚Äôt lose to Kyle Lowry.  Nets in 4.
"Not with that contract, lol. Isn't he making like 30M? If I'm moving 30M worth in salary, it won't be to acquire Kyle Lowry üòÜ"
"In Miami‚Äôs situation, trade Kendrick Nunn for Kyle Lowry. No trading draft picks nor bigs for an expiring contract. Matching his contract would be less of a concern because it‚Äôs his final contractual season. Like Jae Crowder, he‚Äôll be used in the playoffs before becoming a free agent.  Regarding age, Iguodala was a beast at 36 in the ECF. The point in adding Lowry to the Heat roster would be to compensate for Dragic in case of injury, actually adding depth."
"If domantas is top 20 then where are the other young players like Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Fox, Kristaps? Or even older players who still play at a high level like Kyle Lowry, Demar Derozan, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker.   Domantas isn‚Äôt above any of those players, calling him top 20 is just straight stupid lol"
"For what it's worth Brown was among the next two players I would have listed. Frankly if you believe that Siakam's bad spell of form is more than that you can even put him on the back-end of the top 30.  As mentioned in another reply Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry and CJ McCollum would be included in my 30-40 range. range."
"I never subscribed to this claim. Sabonis was a deserved all-star last season. That being said he's got to keep on performing to really establish himself in the top30. There's some big names in the top 30-40 range.  Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum and others."
Yeah but he isn't Kyle Lowry booty
Sixth man is definitely not how I would project Haliburton. His ceiling to me is a Kyle Lowry: elite glue guy and second or third scoring option on a championship team.
I think he has playoff jitters. Reminds me of Kyle Lowry not being that good in the playoffs early in his career with the raptors.
Bucks are getting lucky from 3 and the Heat didn‚Äôt trade for Kyle Lowry.
"nah we just need Kyle Lowry. Or if we‚Äôre choosing from his former teams, 1 manu Ginobili pls"
They Need Kyle Lowry and Fred Van Fleet
"You can even see Smart priming himself to spring backwards in a flop.   Absolutely the right call.  I'm not a fan of either team and probably lean more towards respecting Smart than KD.  He is a flopper though. I can recognize that if he were on my time, I would love him. But when he gets caught baiting like that, you have to accept it. He's not Kyle Lowry yet."
"If my theory is correct than these should be the teams that jump up in the lottery that lost a star and haven‚Äôt been compensated yet  - Rockets (Lost James Harden)  - Raptors (Lost Kawhi Leonard and about to lose Kyle Lowry)  - Oklahoma City (Lost Westbrook,PG and Cp3)  4th team will be some random team  Orlando won‚Äôt jump up because they got a lottery pick from the Vucevic trade anyway and the Spurs won‚Äôt move up because they still have Derozan"
I would even give old Kyle Lowry a 2 yr 60 million contract if we somehow get off of KP. KP's contract is killing Luka's legacy.
maybe they can get a Kyle Lowry?  idk
There are 5 guys who have played for the Celtics in the past 10 years who would each be the raptors goat if they could stand playing out their career in Canada.   Raptors fans can‚Äôt be talking about relevancy when their franchise goat is Kyle Lowry
He had Kyle Lowry and New daddy Fred VanVleet
Mostly to put pressure on the front office to do something big. Hopefully its not something stupidly win now like offering their 2021 &amp; 2028 first round picks and the swap rights to their 2027 pick to S&amp;T for Kyle Lowry.
"If he just cared about winning he would sign a team friendly deal with the Lakers is that going to happen? Unless you are Kyle Lowry alt account I don't think you know what you're talking about lol  It seems like Toronto, Philly, and Miami are the most likely to have Kyle on their rosters next year outside of that we know nothing."
Skull thiccer than Kyle Lowry
"Ever seen Kyle Lowry have ankle issues or finance trouble? Checkmate, flat-gluters"
Kawhi Leonard   Vince Carter   Kyle Lowry
[I think this would‚Äôve helped](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=kyle+lowry+3p%25+this+season)
I think they really did try to level up during the season with the addition of Ariza and Oladipo. Injuries and better coaching on the Bucks part have made a huge difference. I think having another scoring gaurd next to Jimmy would make a huge difference. They still have the chance to pick up Kyle Lowry this offseason or a scoring guard like Devonte Graham in a trade with Charlotte. My guess is that Pat knows how hard it is to run it back so he hedged his bets on keeping the young guys rather than mortgage them for a win now situation.
Don‚Äôt think Kyle Lowry helps the Lakers beat the subs
kyle lowry ain't no midseason trade chip he aint gotta run to the teams to become some 3rd option bitch this aint ben simmons this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy passin' at the fucking rim and fight you at the same time
I wonder if Kyle Lowry could have made a difference.  /S
"With Ben Simmons and Kemba Walker values being in the gutter, you don't know how much Kyle Lowry stans feel vindicated RN"
And this is why you shouldn‚Äôt low ball Kyle Lowry LOL
Seeing the 3 teams who claimed the price for kyle lowry was to high crash and burn gave me an odd amount of satisfaction üòÖ
"Seriously...the Sixers with Lowry would be the favorites to make the finals right now, right?  I still cannot believe they passed up on a legit chance to win a title to hold onto a rookie who scored 2 points in Game 7. I mean, this was fucking it. Maxey is a nice piece and they don't want to give up picks, but Kyle Lowry is a Philly native with championship experience and exactly the skillset this team needed."
Kyle Lowry.
"Probably Ben Simmons to maximise Embiid's healthy years.  He isn't as bad as the sub is going to pretend he is for the off-season, but he probably needs to have a primary point guard along side him to maximise his potential right now (or develop an offense) someone like Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley."
Could‚Äôve traded for Kyle Lowry but wanted to keep Stanley Johnson with a go pro instead ü§∑
Kyle Lowry brings some toughness entire philly squad is soft ash
"Kyle Lowry is the biggest winner tonight. Pelinka, Riley, and Morey look like fools"
Also Kyle is one of the only players I would offer anything to for the rest of time. Don‚Äôt care if it hurts us Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time
Imagine if they had kyle Lowry
Nah but Kyle Lowry Couldn't help
Never too late for Kyle Lowry  or maybe it is
"Could have had Kyle Lowry, thought you had enough.  That's gonna haunt ya'll for real."
Sixers fan were saying George Hill&gt;&gt;&gt;Kyle Lowry after the deadline
nobody gives a shit. Stop bringing up Kyle Lowry
kyle lowry
"In a game 7, the Sixers wing rotation for the final set play was Seth Curry, Shake Milton and George Hill. Ben Simmons not even playable.  Meanwhile Kyle Lowry somehow improving his value without even playing. The list of ""Wish we traded for Kyle Lowry"" teams is now at 3!"
"Should have paid the ""la la land price"" for Kyle Lowry lmaoooo"
"Imagine thinking Maxey, Thybulle or whoever is too much for KYLE LOWRY  Fucking idiots"
Something something Kyle Lowry
imagine not wanting to trade George hill and maxey for kyle lowry
Philly needed their son Kyle Lowry
The last Kyle Lowry potential trade destination domino has fallen. Lowry would‚Äôve been great in this series.
Should've traded for Kyle Lowry lol
Kyle Lowry would* have made the difference
Philly shoulda got Kyle Lowry
All they had to do was pick up Kyle Lowry lol
KYLE LOWRY AINT NO SPOT UP SHOOTER
Kyle Lowry would never
Kyle Lowry would never. Good job Philly low ballers.
Sixers really thought they didn't need Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry would never‚Ä¶.
Kyle Lowry would have dunked that
"How is that controversial, look at my original statement I said IF he can continue playing at this level he has been playing at in the playoffs. Huge if‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs clearly putting up better numbers than what Lowry did this season like I don‚Äôt understand how this is even a debate. Just because it‚Äôs Kyle Lowry who has name recognition people downvote without using common sense"
"Best performing player ever, but overall best gotta be Kyle Lowry. It‚Äôs like why Lebron is the goat thanks to his longevity over Jordan even though Jordan peaked higher. Lebron stayed at a high level longer."
Witnessing the evolution of Kyle Lowry Ain't No Spot Up Shooter has been wild
"do you unironically believe that kyle lowry would accept the mid level exception (6 mil), the only thing the warriors can offer  are you fr"
"Honestly I blame our loss on our bitch ass GM. Marks was so fucking stupid giving up so much for Harden. Could have kept Lavert and we could have swung him and a pick for Kyle Lowry as our sixth man. This way even with injuries we'd still have a reliable ""next man up"" on our bench. Look at Clips with Kawhi going down and Mann stepping up.     Now Sean Marks is on the hot seat. A title next year is a hard requirement of course but honestly if we don't repeat he probably should be fired for constructing a paper thin roster outside of our big 3."
"Overpay Kyle Lowry on a 2 year 50 million dollar contract, basically to help rest of the young team improve while not commiting longer terms to someone like Lonzo"
Kyle Lowry knows that feel
I can see Mike fitting in well on quite a few teams around the league. Once CP3 is off the table he (and Kyle Lowry as well actually) may well have a very nice contract coming his way.
How did the raptors get away with running Fred van fleet and Kyle Lowry in the same line up back in 2019 play offs? Was it just a match up thing that's why they got away with it?
Seth is never going to be the defender or playmaker that Kyle Lowry was.           It‚Äôs about talent too.
Kyle Lowry.
"Yeah is a little on the short size but he is kinda husky for a 19 year old. Broad ass shoulders. I could see him developing into a plus defender. I mean, we‚Äôve seen shorter guards become great defenders before a la Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
"I won't lose sleep over whatever others want to do there.   However, from a personal standpoint, I'd probably prefer to rock jersey designs that were actually worn by the player themselves. For whatever reason, if Kyle Lowry rocked the retro Raptors jersey in question during a throwback night, it somehow feels more authentic to me. Kind of silly when I think about it but I guess it is what it is."
If its a jersey that player we're as a throw back i think it's just okay but still not that cool. I want the Jersey younremember thr player in so I want the Kyle Lowry Championship Jersey  Why not just have the throw back with no name on the back? That way you can keep it and it is always a throwback.
I remember when people on this sub were saying Mann and Kennard with some draft picks weren‚Äôt a good trade for Kyle Lowry earlier this year because they were trash‚Ä¶ ü§°ü§°ü§°s
"Raptors should trade Kyle Lowry for James Harden straight up, too. And while we‚Äôre at it, we can throw in Siakam for KD."
Kyle Lowry wouldn‚Äôt require a maxey bailout so it‚Äôs ok
How old was Kyle Lowry when became an all-star? Wasn‚Äôt he a late bloomer? Sometimes it all about fit and opportunity.
"Oh gosh lol, might as well just go for Kyle Lowry then."
Listen all Masai wanted was Simmons and four firsts for a few months of Kyle Lowry was that really too much?
Remember when Kyle Lowry was available at the trade deadline??? Philly?? Remember?
"Daryl Morey consciously said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt even need Kyle Lowry, let‚Äôs just get George Hill‚Äù"
"Imagine a line up with Kyle Lowry, Embiid, and Simmons.  Kyle will be lobbing them dunks every single time"
"George ""Kyle Lowry Replacement"" Hill"
"Kyrie will be back for the ECF and Harden will be less hobbled, and I'm not sure how Morey was supposed to know the Nets would be hobbled at this juncture of the playoffs. Hindsight is 20/20.   Trading all of our wing depth and valuable assets for a 35 year old Kyle Lowry is not the move for a franchise who's entire core is under 27  We have like 2 or 3 more years of contention, going all in this season would have been beyond short sighted"
All they need is for Kyle Lowry and Danny Green to sign with them.
I'm just glad we dodged the Kyle Lowry trade. Heard from a little birdie he already enrolled his kids in school in Philly.üëÄ
Point guard defense is huge its one of the reasons we traded kemba he would get picked on every single playoff series we played. Kyle Lowry had a field day with him and same with the heat.
"Not to be confused with Canada's ass, Kyle Lowry"
"Raptors meeting with Norman was ""intense"" and ""at one point Kyle Lowry was crying"" but everyone grew closer and a bit lesson was learned"
"&gt; I don‚Äôt waste the rest of our cap space on Kemba when there‚Äôs so many better, safer pieces we can spend our money on.  I agree but /u/MisterTruth said Plan B.  I love the optimism of fanbases that they are all going to sign the 3 FAs worth 60m total in cap space simultaneously.  There's more cap space than FAs worth that money. I wish people would contextualize offseason moves this way.  Chris Paul re-signs with the Suns, Kyle Lowry stays in Toronto, and DeRozan goes somewhere else and suddenly there isn't enough FAs to be worth the amount of space you have."
Is this all a ploy to get Kyle Lowry in  FA?
"&gt;Kawhi Leonard? **DeMar DeRozan**? Kyle Lowry? All of those guys are unrestricted free agents this summer, and **they all have good prior work experience with Ujiri,**  Besides the fact this article reads like a high school creative writing project, what reality is this idiot living in?"
This story isn‚Äôt true. When we won the title in the locker room Kyle Lowry said Nick nurse was the one who made the adjustment.
Trade Brandon Ingram for CJ McCollum and RoCo Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball for Lauri Markannen  Sign Kyle Lowry in free agency Trade Steven Adams for PJ Washington   Lowry CJ RoCo Zion Lauri  PJ Hayes Bledsoe NAW Lewis Jr
"Not to get all ""Do you see LeBron as a father figure"", but I wonder if he has issues with authority, or male authority figures specifically. Kyle Lowry famously had trust issues with coaches and GMs until he came to Toronto and was shown some loyalty. Or maybe it is something like Cuban favouring him too much, taking his side over the advice of their coaching staff.  It could just as easily be, ""He's 22, and kids are gonna act like kids"", but for it to get to a point where someone like Carlisle says ""Fuck it"", something is up. This will make a fun 30 for 30 one day."
Kyle Lowry just wears a diaper... LOL
Kyle Lowry to Celtics Kemba to Mavericks  Porzingis to Raptors with 2nd rounders and maybe a first from the Celtics.  I think this makes sense to me.
But Kyle lowry is also eliminated so it all evens back out inside itself.
"&gt;and that our sub overvalues Romeo and Nesmith in those deals?  No they don't.  It's just that overly-negative people looking for an excuse to shit on 'green-teamers' often miss the nuance in what's actually being said.   People aren't saying Romeo is untouchable, they're saying he's not worth including in trades because of how low his trade value is.   They're not saying Romeo's a 10/10 asset (outside of memes) they're saying he's a 2-3/10 asset who probably only has the value of a 1/10 asset on the market. It doesn't make sense to include him in trades because he doesn't have enough trade value to justify being in those trades.   It's very similar to the Rozier/Ibaka situation, before Rozier broke out and became a key rotation player for us.  Boston / Danny Ainge got made fun of for not ""trading Rozier for Ibaka"". What actually happened was our team offered a package for Ibaka and Orlando asked for Rozier to be added into that package. Our FO never said ""no, Rozier is worth more than Ibaka"" they said ""no, he's worth more than just a trade sweetener for Ibaka"".   If you buy something that's $10.50 and you're not expecting to get change back, do you:  1. Pay with a $10 note and a 50c coin  2. Pay with a $10 note and a $1 bill  We never valued Rozier more than the $10 Ibaka, we just valued him more than the extra 50c they wanted.  It's the same with Romeo.   He's not worth more than the player(s) coming back in hypothetical trades, but he is worth more than the value he adds to a trade.         &gt;Rondo, Kennard and Zubac for him and a 2nd?   Do you mean:  * Why would a team part with guys who aren't even playing all that much?   Kennard is about to be paid 13m/y and he barely plays for them. Rondo is owed 7-8m and isn't playing for them at all.   * Why would a team with limited options and desperate to gamble on elite PG talent value a PG who can potentially be elite?   In between Kemba's two recent injuries, he was playing the most efficient basketball of his career. The Clippers are the exact team that would gamble on that, they don't have other options because they're capped out and have already traded all their picks.   The Clippers do it because it's a very low-risk / high-reward situation for them. They're barely giving anything up at all.     Why do you think **ALL** the Kemba trade rumours we've seen lately have come from LAC beat reporters?  * It's LAC beat reporters saying Boston tried to trade Kemba for Jrue - Boston denied it. *  It's LAC beat reporters saying Kemba feels betrayed and wants out - Kemba's cousin denied it.    They would take on a player with baggage and risks because they can't afford a player without baggage and risks.   They tried to buy 35-year-old Kyle Lowry on an expiring deal and they couldn't afford him, that's where they're at right now."
"My point Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt some super star that puts a team in the finals lmao or he would‚Äôve proven that without Kawhi. And the fact y‚Äôall still worried about it for no type of reason, Kyle Lowry is not winning the sixers a championship just like he didn‚Äôt for you guys, thank kawhi and siakam that for that run"
Yeah Kyle Lowry the franchise savior lmao
"Yeah Kyle Lowry the guy with no finals appearances until kawhi was the key to saving the sixers, lakers and heat. Y‚Äôall keep bringing up all these scenarios cause you won‚Äôt get shit when he walks. If you don‚Äôt think green Maxey and Thybulle AND A FRP isn‚Äôt an over pay, that‚Äôs delusional for an expiring 35 year old"
"Thats not what you offered thats what masai wanted.   ""The¬†Philadelphia 76ers¬†are interested in acquiring¬†Kyle Lowry, but there is a limit to how much they will offer the¬†Toronto Raptors¬†in a potential deal.¬† ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on¬†First Take¬†(h/t¬†Kyle Neubeck¬†of¬†Philly Voice) the Sixers won't package¬†Tyrese Maxey,¬†Matisse Thybulle and draft picks¬†together for Lowry.¬† Windhorst noted that the Raptors want all of those pieces, which include first-round picks in 2021 and 2023, to send Lowry to Philadelphia."""
You underestimate Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry might have come in handy
Kyle Lowry man.   I‚Äôm not mad at him not being trade bc the trade was too lopsided or whatever. But I would be a bit mad at the heat/lakers/76ers if his talents could have pushed them over the edge but they didn‚Äôt pursue him.
The sixers guard play is so bad they‚Äôre forced to play like a starter. They really should‚Äôve gone all in on Kyle Lowry.
"I wonder where jrues rating ends up after this playoffs run  Top 5 PG now?  I think theres an argument to be made.  Definitely no lower than 10th  He's a lot like kyle lowry, the offense is hit or miss but he brings elite defense every game.  Still only 31 so he probably has another 5 years left in the league give or take 1-2 years"
"if we're going to offer *kyle lowry* 2/60, why do we offer *evan fournier* 3 years guaranteed? it doesn't add up.   but yeah, FA starts next week, I'm looking forward to it too. we'll see what happens. I don't expect to get any big names, but some decent rotation guys at good prices is what i think will happen."
"It seems like half the league is apparently interested in Lowry, meanwhile guys like Derozan have to hint at their availability.  Monday: Heat interested in Kyle Lowry  Derozan - ""I would be willing to take a paycut""  Tuesday: Lakers are interested in Lowry  Derozan - ""Who wouldn't want to go home?""  Wednesday:  - Knicks interested in Lowry  Derozan - ""I just want to help a team that hasn't had much success in a while""  Thursday : Magic struggle to find targets for their capspace  Derozan - ""it's not about winning, it's about that Florida weather"""
"i mean if we could we would give him that contract, why should he take less from yall lol.

"I feel like signing 36 year old Kyle Lowry to a near-max 3 year deal is a great way to guarantee Zion ends up unhappy.  Zion just turned 21 this month and has all of 85 NBA games under his belt.  Absurd that the Pels would think they need to make a panic move like Lowry just because he's the best available option this offseason.  Next offseason will be way better, and in the meantime you can do some stupid 1 year overpay to somebody to get better for this year."
"**How the phone call went down:**  Morey: *""Good morning Masai, I'd like to offer you an amazing deal. I'll give you Ben Simmons in exchange for Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, your first round 4th pick as well as--""*  *Click *   Morey: *""Hello? Hello!?!?""*"
"No way OKC does this, it's again just all smoke, as usual, it's literally going backwards trading Shai for a first-round pick in this draft, you already got a young player who can be a star in the league, if you are worried about paying him that's just not the right way to look at it, who else you gonna pay anyways.  Also as a raptors fan, it makes zero sense to me to go after Beal, trade for simmons using assets that isn't a POTENTIAL Kyle Lowry sign and trade, and obviously the idea of swapping 4 and 6 just to get a few other assets, especially because raps are also interested in Barnes who Magic really want anyways."
"I honestly wouldn't worry too much about the 30m ask. 3 years is relatively short plus expirings always have value so it's really just year 2 (fwiw I don't think there'd be a severe decline in play in year 2, his game is way more IQ based than anything else) and injuries that are the worries.  Beyond that, when you look at the going rate for contracts, it's pretty worth it when you consider a Kyle Kuzma getting 13m or Norman Powell/Gary Trent looking for the 18-25 range.  With Lowry you get a ton of desirable skills in a player (shooting, defending, playmaking) as well as a guy who's shown he can carry any random collection of bench guys to great advanced stats and a vocal leader on offense and defense who brings a ton of intangibles."
"Why not ask for pascal siakam, Kyle Lowry, the fourth pick, and a bag of chips too if Morey is offering delusional trades?"
Don‚Äôt forget he asked for Kyle Lowry too!
Okay but you're actually delusional if you think that sixers team that lost to the Hawks were just a Kyle Lowry away from winning a ring. Kyle Lowry was the difference between losing in the second round to losing in 5 to the bucks. Is that worth selling every last asset you have for a guy that could just walk?
Remember when the sixers were one Kyle Lowry away from winning the chip
"Definitely not Maxey and a first.  It was something like Maxey, thybelle, and first round picks.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/raptors/.amp/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-could-have-helped-philadelphia-76ers  Just a quick Google search too."
"I don't know why so many people think Kyle Lowry is excited about the prospect of going to a perennial lottery team like the Pelicans. He's gonna use their cap space as leverage to get Toronto to trade him to the team of his choosing by making it a ""trade me here or I'll go to New Orleans and you'll get nothing"" decision."
"I think it's more likely Lowry uses the threat of getting a 3/90 contract from New Orleans as leverage to get Toronto to trade him to his preferred destination (wherever that is) for similar money.   Like let's use the Lakers as an example, since [there have been recent reports that he's interested in going there.](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/.amp/news/nba-report-demar-derozan-and-kyle-lowry-reportedly-interested-in-joining-los-angeles-lakers) If the Lakers trade Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell there along with the 22nd pick then they too could offer Lowry a 3 year $90 million contract via sign and trade. Up till now the assumption would have been that that's not enough for Toronto to trade Lowry, but now that there's the threat that they could lose him for nothing, they'd probably prefer that instead.   The same thing could apply with the Sixers or any other team he wanted to go to who's over the cap. All New Orleans having this room to offer him a deal means is that Lowry now has the leverage to basically orchestrate his own sign and trade anywhere he wants with little to no pushback from Toronto. I think he's playing David Griffin, rather than him having a legit desire to go play for a lottery team."
Correction someone currently worse but on the same timeline. Or Kyle Lowry in which case David Griffin has to go
"I feel like it might be in retaliation for the ridiculous ask the Raptors were asking for for Lowry at the trade deadline.   I know the Sixers have to get rid of Simmons but I doubt they're that desperate. He still has a lot of value in the league as an all-defensive player and facilitator. Shit, in the right system, he might not need to shoot at all.  I honestly just don't want Kyle Lowry for him; I don't feel it's enough and trading for Lowry feels like a bit of a trap."
Can Toronto even trade Lowry? He‚Äôs a FA so wouldn‚Äôt it have to be a S&amp;T in which Toronto can only swap a player for Kyle?
Especially that Kyle Lowry got one you know DeRozan is itching for a ring also.
"considering how much George Hill gave them in the playoffs, and that to get Lowry you'd need to facilitate a trade anyway I would beg to differ. Kyle could indeed walk to NOLA, but not Philly."
"They're both FA, Miami don't need to offer anything.   Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, PF?, Bam Adebayo."
"not really sure what the point you are making here is. Paying lonzo 4 for 100 right now would mean, barring unforseen events, in 2-3 years, lonzos contract is around 18-22 percent of the cap. Thats what you pay for an high level starter on a championship team and you could still surround your core with another star alongside zion. milwaukee won this year with both khris and jrue earning 30 mill or so apiece, lonzo earning 25 per year wouldnt prevent the pellies from adding more talent.   Even if lonzo remains the exact player he is right now, i would rather have him going forward because he fits the pelicans actual title window, which is when lakers, clippers, warriors age, or really, steph, kawhi, and lebron, age and either decline or retire. Having kyle lowry for 2-3 years now, still not being a championship team, then trying to find suitable talent later is so much worse than just giving lonzo close to his 25 percent max, developing with him on the team, then trying to win in the next 2-4  years. Even if lonzo doesnt work out a high iq point guard who would be like 25-27 in his prime would fetch them assets on the trade market later on, are pellies willing to roll the dice on a 37-38 year old lowry being valuable? lowry is the age chris paul was when he was traded to the suns, i wouldnt want to bet on either 2-3 years from now"
"sure, but thats not new orleans bet to make. Ill rather have lonzo for the next 10 years than kyle lowry for what, 3-4years? Think he would be the same at 40?"
"i think memphis wins this trade   pels clear capspace which they dont really need. If i was a pelly fan ill rather have lonzo than kyle lowry. They try to compete now but does jonas really move the needle that much for them?  on the other hand, memphis moves up 7 spots into the lottery, get 'leadership' with steven and bledsoe, and who knows, god forbid the lakers have some bad injury or lebron just ages rapidly, but say lakers get injured again next year, that pick could potentially be in the 13-20 range. Basically they gave jonas away for 2 bites at the draft apple with the biggest bite being this year at number 10, which historically doesnt produce stars, but decent high upside starters. Memphis positions themselves a bit better for the futture while orleans gets jonas for a year and space to potentially chase lowry instead of signing ball?"

Gonna have to trade Seth hill and maxey or thybulle for 30 million Kyle Lowry lol yeah great trade
"Pels opening up cap space for Kyle Lowry. They're going for it. I'm sure they are hoping Kyle has a similar impact as CP3 did on the Suns. Just my thought, but I think it's quite close to the truth. If they don't get Kyle, then they'll aim for one of the other PG's on the FA market.  Even without getting Kyle, they instantly improve by putting JV in as Starting C."
"I don‚Äôt have to be in his inner circle, I just have to look up what the man himself said 2 months ago:         [""Money talks, and years talk,"" Lowry told reporters. ""... At the end of the day, I want to make sure my family is taken care of for generations.""](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002973-raptors-kyle-lowry-on-2021-nba-free-agency-money-talksyears-talk-not-retiring)  You can also look up how Kyle‚Äôs manager told WOJ that they are looking for 50M/2 years contract at minimum.             Neither of us know what is going to happen, at least my claims are backed up by Kyle‚Äôs actual actions and quotes."
"I wouldn't call Brook Lopez a volume shooter either.  Zion was good on Defense in College I think he'll be fine.  Ingram is tall and I've actually seen him bother some people on D.  Jrue is such a better ball handler and team leader than Lonzo, I see it more likely that Lonzo gets traded and they go hard for Kyle Lowry"
Kyle Lowry
"And Lowry has amazing chemistry with JV.   That said, I don't see Kyle being willing to go to the Pelicans. If anything, they could use the space to re-sign Lonzo."
Kyle Lowry too
"Kyle Lowry aint no role player, difference between a championship or not for a lot of contending teams, he'd join teams and might even be their second best player"
"There‚Äôs 42 players in the nba getting paid over 25$ mil next season, is Kyle Lowry won‚Äôt a top 42 guy right now?"
What culture is Kyle Lowry transforming?
"So I've been thinking about a deal involving Kyle and Ben for a while now. I remember talking to a friend about it as we watched the Heat V Lakers finals... The main thing that changed since then is Ben's stock has gone done further, where Lowry is a year older and one year further removed from a championship, but I feel like his stock is relatively the same.  My perspective was that it makes sense for Kyle to go to Philly if he goes anywhere, and he's a better fit for Embiid in the pick and roll, where Ben doesn't fit as well with Embiid as the main point of the offence.  Ben would fit in with the Raptors on defence, and he could even play the 5 in a small ball line up of FVV, GTJ, OG, and Siakam (at the 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively) without sacrificing a ton on defence.  Another thing I often hear is about how tough and critical  the fans in Philly can be, and how Ben is not someone who responds to negativity very well. I think the city could be a better fit for him in that way. Maybe more positivity could be better for his mental game when it comes to shooting...  And speaking of shooting... I think even with the Raps development team, there's a way that you can play ben without having to shoot. In previous iterations of the Raptors small ball line they sacrificed size for speed and shooting. With the lineup described above they could still have 4/5 strong shooters, very solid defense, speed, ball handling and play making, which I think could work well. I think he would do well in transition as a playmaker obviously, and using him as a bit of a point forward in some possessions could be interesting.   I think in a worst case scenario the Raps could help improve Ben's stock after this past year, and could flip him in a year or two with time still left on his contract. I don't see a movie that makes them a true contender this year, but I don't think this is a move that hurts their chances of getting there in another few years."
"Really? Idk, it's the Kyle Lowry offer + Simmons. Portland would immediately become one of the better defensive teams in the west. I don't think it's atrocious"
"I love the Spurs and liked his upturn there but I would support any move he wants. Get this man a ring.  My dream move would be for him and Kyle Lowry to reunite somewhere, maybe the Sixers."
"Suns went from not in the playoffs and added CP3 and went to the finals, after legit a couple seasons ago going to OKC as a negative asset. Hawks were not thought of as a Conference finals team before the season. Who the fuck knows whats gonna happen next year, but as a raptors fan i hope kyle secures a fat bag as he deserves one and has got a ring. If NBA GM‚Äôs think hes worth 2/$60, teams like Philly and Heat need to maximise their window on Embiid and Butler before they waste it, better to overpay lowry and try get over the edge than wallow as a Semi finalist for the next few season till they‚Äôre out of their prime"
"Hi it's me Kyle Lowry, actually I'm okay with 20 million and I take Venmo."
NBA champion Kyle Lowry?
"The market is dictated by needs vs. availability.  If Heat have a window, Kyle makes them better, he‚Äôs worth whatever gets them better because the alternative is not getting better at that position.  All the available guards are looking for that price right now, Lowry is the best available option."
He going where ever kyle lowry goes bet 100%
Imagine if Demar and Kyle Lowry end up on the Lakers... Lebron would get to play with his son(s).
I am also looking for more money than Kyle Lowry. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to get it.
Kyle Lowry is 35‚Ä¶
"Lmao I'm the biggest Kyle Lowry fan and even I'm a bit skeptical about 90mil/3 years.  But if the market is there, get that bag king. If a team has cap space to sign him outright, I think we'll just let him leave. For whatever team that's looking to S&amp;T him they gonna have to give us some good stuff because no way we taking on 30 million dead salary."
"But realistically, the winning isn't going to really happen until 2023-4, and Kyle Lowry will be 37"
"No, but you can have a S&amp;T'd Kyle Lowry üòÇ"
"OP, this sentence came right after  &gt;But that type of scenario may not materialize before the draft, and so the broad assumption around the league has been that Toronto will select Suggs here, as a long-term replacement for free agent Kyle Lowry."
"This is where Lowe is so off the mark.    &gt;If the Sixers can get a guard some other way. Just in theory if they can sign and trade for Kyle Lowry. They paper over one need. What if they keep Simmons, see how he functions in this ecosystem where we have a legit lead guard, ups his trade value, see what happens in Portland‚Ä¶ see what other situation goes haywire and see what happens to Ben Simmons trade value in January or February. I think frankly that makes a lot of sense.‚Äù   What happens to Ben Simmons trade value if he comes out next season not shooting jumpers or threes? What is his value 16/8/8 shooting 60% from the line not taking any outside shots? Now you got a guy on a max deal who's a 3rd option at best on playoff team. Right now there's GMs who think...  &gt;He's athletic, he's a great defender, he's a great facilitator, I can fix his jumper, I can fix his foul shooting, I can fix his timidity.    But when he comes out still not shooting, still on a max contract, those GMs start to realize that he's not going to fix those problems. Then they ask themselves exactly what Ben can do for them to justify the cost. And the answer is, Ben is a guy who can't even be on the floor late in a playoff game, while his defense and stat line can be nice, his game is the kiss of death for your playoff chances if you over invest.    Tldr, his trade value will likely go down."
"Neither was Siakam, Kyle Lowry was lol"
"Ben Simmons for Kyle Lowry straight up.. hahaha nah jk.. unless.. haha no no noo, see ya next week with a serious offer"
"76ers would want more. Whether or not that's reasonable is debatable.  If Kyle wanted to go to Philly, Siakam/Lowry for Simmons/filler is interesting."
I doubt it. There's already ball dominant players like Kyrie in Dame and Tatum.   They need a playmaker like Kyle Lowry.
I will be very surprised if he transcends John Wall or even Kyle Lowry level much less Jason Kidd   Getting a John Wall type prospect is amazing tho so you should be excited to draft him
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
Kyle Lowry is almost a lock he has like an 84% chance to make it according to basketball reference
USA should go all out and trade for Kyle Lowry. Do it cowards!
"This season, I'd say our loss vs Portland when we were heavily undermanned, had a starting lineup that averages a combined 25 ppg or something, and still managed to keep the game close till the middle of the 4th quarter.  In the past few seasons, I liked Toronto vs Orlando 2019 G3, we almost came back and the atmosphere was insane (wish I went). First home playoff game in 7 years, almost come back and win till Kyle Lowry gets that offensive rebound off the bounce. Really hurt but a nice game overall."
We might as well try. The chain reaction might get them Kyle Lowry
Bruh you‚Äôre not getting Dame with KCP being the centre piece of the deal. Like what? That‚Äôs not even good enough for Kyle Lowry on an expiring.
"I'm biased but if Kyle Lowry wasn't a FA, he would've fit this team like a fucking glove.  for one, he'd do all the right things like distribute the ball, play solid d and not be a chucker."
Isiah Thomas and Magic Johnson. Also even Kyle Lowry recently. All champions.
As others have said you can have 10 and Bledsoe or maybe Kyle Lowry and 17  Easy decision if you‚Äôre confident Lowry signs.
"We have Kyle Kuzma, THT, Dennis (S&amp;T), KCP, some picks, etc.  Depending on salaries and what you all would want in return depending on other offseason acquisitions, we have enough ‚Äúvalue‚Äù to return for just Lowry."
Replace him with Kyle Lowry!
Kyle Lowry looking good out there
you're seriously comparing one of the all time point guards to Kyle Lowry?
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
They‚Äôre going to be paying Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler $75MM in 2024. Which is probably not going to feel good unless they manage to win the title before then.
Lol. Kyle Lowry is a LOT better.  Have you heard of a thing called Defense?
"Kyle ""bad boy""""mike"" Lowry"
How did the Heat win? Kyle Lowry is old and not that much of an upgrade over Dragic.
"Yabusele got the body of Kyle Lowry, solid posterior chain."
"Suns getting CP3, Payne, and McGee are all solid moves IMO.  Even if CP3 will be severely overpaid at 40, these next two years will be great.  I'm unsure how to feel about Kyle Lowry to Miami for 90 mil... I don't think his impact is nearly the level of Chris Paul's, and I don't think the Heat were ""one piece"" away from contention.. it'll be interesting to see in 8 months.  Lakers definitely did something, it'll either be huge or a horrifying season.   Losers so far:  Wolves - have done nothing  GSW - missed out on their targets but OPJ is a nice consolation.  Draft was nice too landing Kuminga.  Pelicans almost lost but snuck in Graham.  McDermott and Robinson won Sixers aren't anywhere close to trading Simmons it feels like and aren't really getting any targets either."
DIDN'T KNOW KYLE LOWRY PLAYED FOR ITALY
"considering the 2 people who play the position he's sized for are now NBA Champion Kyle Lowry and The Greatest Undrafted Shooter In NBA History, yeah -- who's he gonna replace? Jimmy?"
Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry aren't particularly close to 20 shots.  Both are around 12 regular season and Chris only shot about 15 times a game in the playoffs.
not morey waiving his great value kyle lowry.
"Chris Paul is one of the GOAT point guards, so yes its better than the Kyle Lowry deal"
You‚Äôre crazy if you think Lowry will help them beat the Bucks lol.  Jrue just had one of the greatest defensive championship runs of all time but an old kyle Lowry out of all people will stop him.
"honestly, I think it's 50/50. They're gonna go as far as Kyle Lowry can take them. He looked pretty damn good last season so I would imagine that could translate in Miami quite easily but anything can happen."
"Why are the Heat doing him dirty like this. Goran has played his heart out in Miami. And Kyle Lowry is older than him, and honestly not a whole much better."
Jimmy Butler Kyle Lowry Demar Derozen all United by crushing losses to Lebron James
Imagine someone going back to 2013 and telling you Kyle Lowry was going to be a future Hall of Famer.
Lakers are adding veteran shooters+Westbrook so I‚Äôd favor them. I don‚Äôt think Kyle Lowry moves MIA past Milwaukee. Jrue Holiday locked up CP3 &amp; Book he‚Äôd give Lowry the death penalty in a 7 game series. Giannis already took Jimmy‚Äôs lunch money and I haven‚Äôt even mentioned Ka$H money Middleton.
"Miami needed a PF and he's the right price, and all the decent offense creators were off the board already. It's an organization that values defense so he'll be welcomed here.  Starting 5: Kyle Lowry, Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, PJ Tucker, Duncan Robinson  Defense heavy, for sure. We had offense problems last season, looks like we're in for more of it.  If Oladipo signs a small contract then in the later part of the season we can put out a defensive 4th quarter lineup of Lowry, Bam, Jimmy, PJ, and Dipo."
Contracts are fucking ridiculous at this point so I have no idea what to make of any of this. Last year everyone kept telling him Grant was a shit contract and I argued repeatedly he‚Äôs worth it.   All I know is I would not be happy to be the team giving Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry contracts this year
Kyle Lowry is like 3 months older than Dragic
So they got rid of Dragic and Olynyk who was their most effective big at the end of the season.  And added Kyle Lowry who is really good but older and PJ Tucker who got burned by KD for a whole series.  And then kept Duncan Robinson who's no showed in 2 playoffs.  I'm not sure Heat fans should be jerking each other off quite yet.
"Fools gold  They just gave fat contracts to Duncan Robinson, jimmy butler and Kyle Lowry"
"Of course he did that because he's a floor raiser, his skill set lends itself to carrying bad teams to more wins than they would otherwise get.  He's not the type of PG you get if you are trying to be a championship contender and fit around LeBron and AD, he's not Chris Paul, he's not Kyle Lowry, he's not Mike Conley."
kyle lowry and jimmy butler is gonna be so underrated until playoffs. that team is going to go insanely far
I have to say that I am PUMPED!! Getting Jimmy Butler‚Äôs 4 year deal done and adding Kyle Lowry &amp; PJ Tucker?! Great moves for the Heat IMO üî•üî•
"Do you think Embiid wants a championship, or does he want the difference between a Max and a Supermax ?  Because a Miami team cored around Embiid, Jimmy Buckets and Kyle Lowry is looking tasty, and if it doesn't work, he's where he is now - carrying two overpaid players."
"Should have signed Kyle Lowry, then you'd have a big ass backcourt"
"One last time as a raptor,  kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time."
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that‚Äôs not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
"I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but I expected more this evening. Lonzo Ball going from one lottery team to another, people signing with the same teams and Kyle Lowry going to a team that has a ceiling of a four seed."
we still need a point guard so hopefully that won't even be on fournier's shoulders anyway  missing out on kyle lowry really sucks for that prospect though.
"This just in, Kyle Lowry has agreed to a five-year, 100M contract with Manchester United F.C."
lol at all the people who called us idiots for not trading Kyle at the deadline . After the playoffs teams started to realize they NEEDED Lowry
"By¬†Sam Quinn  ¬†  7m ago2 min read  [Kyle Lowry](playerlink://nba/1113164)¬†will join the¬†[Miami Heat](teamlink://346)¬†on a three-year deal through a sign-and-trade arrangement with the¬†[Toronto Raptors](teamlink://358), according to Vincent Goodwill of¬†[Yahoo Sports](https://twitter.com/VinceGoodwill/status/1422316481501671446).

I didn't particularly want Kyle Lowry personally but it woulda been nice to have Demar. But ultimately I'm not pressed for either
"Kyle Lowry is a naughty player, I saw him headbutt George Hill's crotch one time!"
God bless Kyle Lowry. A great raptor.
"At the start of the 22-23 season, Miami will be paying Lowry, Butler and Bam ~106 million. Jimmy will be 34 and Kyle will be 37 going on 38. They‚Äôre pretty solidly in win now mode."

Kyle Lowry getting him paid.
Kyle lowry aint no.... aint no.... Toronto Raptor T_T

"Kyle Lowry on teams that wear red, name a more iconic duo"
Heat Legend Kyle Lowry
I think Kyle Lowry is leaving the Raptors!
Would you accept Simmons and Tobias for Siakam and Kyle Lowry?
"Yeah, doesn't this put him in the conversation with Kyle Lowry, Jrue Holiday, or... well, I guess he's probably better than KCP. Lakers didn't really have a third option, did they?"
"I've been a fan for a long time and I know that the Mavs have missed on signing big free agents in the past. I literally have a Mavericks tattoo that I got after they won in 2011. I also know that most of these teams that make big free agent acquisitions don't end up winning championships unless those teams have Lebron on them. Kyle Lowry is old as fuck and Derozen isn't the answer either. Luka just needs some defenders and shooters around him. It'll all be okay, I promise."
Why does almost every single post today have a picture of Kyle Lowry even if it isn‚Äôt talking about him?
If Kyle Lowry actually signs with the heat they would be stupid to let him go
"My instinct says Kyle Lowry.  He's a solid leader who doesn't have the issues that many leaders face being that they powertrip.  If the 2019 Raptors stars were a survivor final, Lowry may win the jury vote over Kawhi because he's loved that much by the people he's around"
Kyle Lowry and demar derozan are interested in making a championship run together as part of the Knicks organization - Per Sources
"We're not yet sure if Lonzo Ball is getting moved - New Orleans would have to sign Kyle Lowry for them not to match it (especially if it's only a 4yr/80mil deal) or Lonzo would have to be overpayed. I guess the other option would be a double sign-and-trade as suggested by Hollinger but it's not super likely in my opinion.  The upcoming 2021-2022 season is the final year of LaVine's current contract (19.5mil per year). Ideally they'd have to get someone this year before the Bulls cap out with the upcoming maximum contract for LaVine (5yrs/195mil). This year's draft class is not super strong but Point Guard still remains a position of need for them. And maybe it's just me being high on Lonzo, but I'd really like him there. I do not think Coby White is the option for the starting spot."
...would Phoenix be better off with Kyle Lowry? *ducks*
"Again, Kyle Lowry, fuck off"
WHY IS KYLE LOWRY IN THE HEADER AGAIN
"He cost $11m this season and averaged 15/5/6 while playing decent defense and being one of NOLA's only reliable floor spacers around Zion.  He may have underwhelmed in LA, but he's been a very good player in NOLA at very good value. He may not be as good as Kyle Lowry, but he's got better every year and there are plenty of reason's the Pels would like to keep him around."
Kawhi Leonard plans turn into Kyle Lowry plans that turn into Goran Dragic plans but end up ultimately just resulting in Kelly Oubre and Dennis Schroder for a combined $35 mil APY plans.
this isn‚Äôt happening but u missed the whole ‚Äúreuniting with kyle lowry‚Äù part
Kyle Lowry must have something on Riley to do this.
Why is Kyle Lowry in the header?
"First of all I'm not going to talk about what you said about Lowry. Secondly, Green was a starter when he was healthy. thybulle was the 6th man, and helped make trae shoot 39% from the field, and maxey gave them decent bench minutes. Remove them and the team has 0 decent depth. Also, Morey probably didn't want to give 4 young cheap assets for half a year of a of Kyle Lowry, who isn't gonna put them over the nets"
"Also, Fischer's article on Bleacher Report talks about how the team is considering not keeping Precious as well and packaging him with Dragic to flip.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2946713-nba-sources-kyle-lowry-demar-derozan-emerge-as-pivotal-dominoes"
"Kyle Lowry is great, but he is also 35 and a 6‚Äù0ish guard. He‚Äôs an improvement over Dragic, but he isn‚Äôt some savior for the Heat."
"[uh, he‚Äôs definitely reporting it in an article](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2946713-nba-sources-kyle-lowry-demar-derozan-emerge-as-pivotal-dominoes.amp.html?__twitter_impression=true)"
"if Kyle Lowry won't come to Philly. I have no idea who will.  I still don't get why Philly can't get FAs, we're a top 4 market that sells out every game."
I‚Äôm in love with a man and his name is Kyle Lowry
Kyle Lowry ..... wow fits like a glove
"I‚Äôm not trying to overreact but I legitimately think we look like a 60-win team.  We‚Äôre blowing teams out and it‚Äôs not even close. Our offense hasn‚Äôt relied on hot shooting and our defense isn‚Äôt just momentarily looking good because of wonky opponent 3 point shooting. Our rotations are on point. Bam has been a monster as a help defender as usual and Dedmon‚Äôs been our go-to weapon if we‚Äôre trying to play drop coverage.   Also, Kyle Lowry has been a blessing. He‚Äôs in the Jimmy Butler tier of rarified air as an on the fly decision maker."
Kyle Lowry really do hit different

Kyle Lowry and [Infini Robinson](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1012935-kyle-lowry-charged-with-misdemeanor-battery-on-female-referee)
"This is silly. from the go Zion was a big dude with injury history who didn't really want to be there, but in a city known for its cuisine. They should have put all kinds of things into his contract, had a personal chef, nutritionist, do the Miami thing where they have conditioning commitments ( i don't know how Kyle Lowry made it)  I doubt he plays before Christmas"
"going after Lowry was always going to be a PR move as a way for the FO to tell their fans that ""hey, we tried to get this guy, didn't work out""; it never was anything that materialized beyond an exploratory phone call at best.  why the fuck would he agree to a move to a team that isn't close to contending for anything at the trade deadline?  masai wasn't just going to move him anywhere without his input.  I could've seen kyle go to Philly, Dallas, Miami, etc at the deadline, but New Orleans, no fucking way."
Kyle Lowry/Natalie Sago
"Don't see why he can't, he's freed from PG duties and can concentrate on getting buckets and being an All-NBA defensive player.   If only we could've gotten that Kyle Lowry guy... :["
"Agreed, you don't know how many times I posted on both here and /r/bostonceltics that we need to do everything we can to get Kyle Lowry.  Obviously that was never realistically on the table, and Canada's booty now resides on South Beach, but man I wish we had traded for literally any of Jrue/CP3/Lowry/Conley rather than get Kemba after Kyrie decided to depart."
"My biggest what ifs that aren't talked about.   What if Tim Duncan actually signed that magic contract. New era of shaq and kobe but now McGrady and Duncan ?   What if kobe never came off the bench. Would he of been the greatest scorer of all time ?   What if the raptors never traded their 13th pick in 2013.  Would they of won the 2019 nba championship with giannas on their team, but no Kyle Lowry?"
"Did you watch us in the playoffs? PG did well as a kind of point forward with Reggie, Batum and PatBev (now Bledsoe) helping w playmaking. Meanwhile we should've been much better on defense but weren't because we had Zubac as our rim protector. I'd take Clint Capela over Kyle Lowry anyday."
"Known floor lowerer, Kyle Lowry."

"You broke us in the Bubble man, our team has never and will never be the same since that series.   Also the PG position is finally starting to get it's due in terms of how incredibly important it is. Bucks trade for Jrue Holiday and go from being the biggest embarrassment in the league in the Bubble to hoisting the Larry O'Brien trophy the next year. Suns trade for Chris Paul and go from out of the playoffs to making the Finals. Jazz added Mike Conley and now they are a serious contender.   And obviously now for the best example, you guys added Kyle Lowry and look at the difference he's made to your team that got embarrassed last year."
They really should‚Äôve went for Kyle Lowry or someone of that elk. They need someone to control the flow of the game and spread that ball.  Edit: ilk*
K sounds like you're pretty high up on Dragic. Dragic for that scrub Kyle Lowry?
They don't have a Kyle Lowry
"This is the Kyle Lowry effect, dude is amazing at making his teammates shine"
"he also isn‚Äôt a demar derozan, kyle lowry, chris paul type vet"
"He averaged 21.5/6.9/7.1 on 60.7 TS%. That's a difference of three points which evens out with the drop in assists and definitely doesn't make up for Lowry being a hot garbage individually, you clueless clown. As for the three-point percentage: he's shooting one three per game, he could be making zero of them and it'd barely affect his efficiency.   This makes me wonder: are you a clueless clown, or are you actually an absolute fucking moron who thinks Kyle Lowry is great because he used to play for your favorite team?"
Oh yeah Fred is already resembling a lot of what Lowry does. Couldn‚Äôt really show it while he was playing with Kyle but this year he‚Äôs been our engine and become the vocal leader of the team.
"Lowry literally is having games that Jimmy had in year 1.  Where some just look at the box score and think ""why was he signed? What does he offer?""...the answer is, A LOT.  I can't wait for the next ""Kyle Lowry"" to come around; every team really needs their own. And lucky for you guys it sounds like Lowry already instilled a lot of these great traits onto FVV."
"For the Raptors, obviously it's a championship moment but rather than the shot, I always loved this picture of Kyle Lowry. Almost a decade of toiling away with us and he finally gets to the top of the mountain and you can feel the emotion from him  https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/nba-finals-raptors-warriors-game-6-recap-1.5175211"
"People don't realize the giant impact Kyle has on the court until they're watching him regularly. I'm sad he's not a Raptor anymore, but I'm happy another fan base gets to see how good this guy is at everything.  Has he even scored 10 points in a game yet? I don't think he has and Heat fans are universally praising his performance thus far. That's the Lowry impact."
I recommend watching a heat game if you haven't already. Kyle Lowry pushes the pace and launches Jimmy full court passes and he just takes advantage of the defense immediately. I think it's realistic for him to average 25 tbh but I'm biased

"&gt; -Jimmy Butler currently leads the league in Defensive Win Shares, followed closely by Bam Adebayo at No. 4. Tyler Herro (17), Kyle Lowry (18) and Duncan Robinson (19) all sit within the Top 20.  - Jimmy Butler currently leads the league in Defensive Points Saved at +21.59. Bam Adebayo is No. 6 at +8.81.  These are literally just stats that look at team defensive rating and mostly assign credit based on minutes played  Defensive Win Shares is not even a useful stat OVER MULTI-SEASON STRETCHES. Absolutely kills me when people use it for like 6 games lol"
"Are you referring to the RAPTOR stat? That states Kyle Lowry was -1.1 even though he's known was a good defender. LeBron James was +.6 even though he was considered coasting on defense last season. Luka was -0.8 and no one would say he's a better defender than Lowry and be taken seriously. Jrue Holiday was +1.1. Derrick Rose, Cameron Payne and Raul Neto are all better defenders than him by this metric.  This is why advanced stats aren't the end all be all. They're usually only useful for comparing people on the same team. Which is why Sexton being -0.5 and Garland being -3.0 so far this season is significant. Within their own team, Garland drags the defense down much more. Defenses are way more about teams than individual players. Which is why usually most people on a good defensive team even the bad defenders have good defensive advanced stats number."
Heat vs raptors with Kyle Lowry having a a crisis of loyalty
"Agreed, the Kyle Lowry effect is real."
I'm just happy Lowry gets a couple more chances at another ring with one of his best friends. Also hope it opens up more eyes on how good Kyle has been for the last while.

"We need to reclaim this as a ""You just lost to"" meme. If we are the bubble Guppies then what does that make the teams that dont beat us?   Real talk though our team got to those finals because of many factors coming together. If I were to name a few, Duncans breakout shooting year, Tyler and (to a lesser extent purhaps )Kendricks amazing Rookie campaigns. Bam making a major leap to All-Star level Center, and Jimmy turning on god mode.  Another big part was Goran Dragics elite scoring and playmaking abilities. Last season the limited offseason took its toll on the players both physically and mentally and I think one of the most notable ones was Goran. Of course he wasnt the only one, what woth general decreased effort, herros struggles in his sophmore season, losing Crowder, ect.   But now that we have Lowry, We have regained the missing skills Goran contributed and more as Kyle also is an amazing defender and his outlets seem to really drive our teams pace.   We also got a guy with elite defense at the 4 which was what crowder brought us 2 seasons back and was another key element we were missing last year. Arizais a great defender of course and did his best but didnt have the strength we needed at the 4 position.  And Tyler Herro has effectively reclaimed the high volume scoring 6th mam spot that him amd dragic gave us in the19-20 season.  Dedmon and Morris are solid backups at the big man positions and im very glad we got them and the end of bench huys like Martin, Vincent, Yurtseven, give is great histle when they get thier chances.   Oberall this team has been exciting and its too early to get our hopes up too much but whay weve seen is very impressive and that makes it hard not to get our hopes up."
"Look at what CP3 did for Booker. This team has desperately needed a pass first PG but they seem to think they need another scorer at the PG. From IT to Kyrie to  Kemba to Schroeder.   They should have moved mountains to get CP3, Kyle Lowry, lonzo, even rondo. Need a table setter"
"Right. And that works perfectly fine. The issue only occurs because NBA chooses to display tenths of a second after the shot clock hits 5 seconds. If they do the integer counting before 5 seconds, here is what happens.  1 second elapses = 23  2 = 22  12 = 12  17 = 7  18 = 6  18.5 = 6 still (this is fine)   18.9 = 6 still (no problems)   19 = 5  19.1 = 4.9  What ends up happening is that the number 5, which represents 5.00 is only shown for a tenth of a second.  What will end up happening is that numbers will suddenly jump from 6 to 4.9 in a tenth of a second, which does not make for a good viewing experience.  They could omit the tenths of a second and show whole numbers the entire way, but personally, as someone with a science and computer science background, I like the heightened accuracy the tenths of a second provides.  Especially in tense late game low shot clock scenarios. The Kyle lowry pass, the Ayton dunk, etc..."
The Kyle Lowry Heat are 5-0
"Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: The #12 pick in the 2013 draft is one of the most important threads in modern NBA history. That pick originally belonged to the Toronto Raptors. They traded it to Houston in a package to acquire Kyle Lowry.  Houston then sent that pick to OKC in a package to acquire James Harden.  OKC were holding on to that pick and had their eyes firmly set on Steve Adams in the 2013 draft. Meanwhile, Masai Ujiri was making a big run at trying to get that pick back from OKC. The reason: He was desperate to draft Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Had one of the 11 teams picking before OKC nabbed Steven Adams, chances are OKC would have accepted a trade to send that pick back to Toronto, and Giannis would have been a Raptor.  One innocent pick in the middle of the draft got Toronto the greatest raptor of all time in Kyle Lowry, got Houston one of the greatest Rockets of all time in James Harden, and secured Milwaukee one of the greatest Bucks of all time in Giannis Antetokounmpo."
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS  **ahem**  kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time

KYLE LOWRY AINT NO SPOT UP SHOOTER
How dare you talk about my personal lord and saviour Kyle Lowry like that.
"Yeesh I‚Äôm convinced this dude doesn‚Äôt watch any basketball games lol. Everytime he makes a post here it‚Äôs usually solely based on box score stats. I watched Kyle Lowry make a ton of smart ass plays against us last night,  we were getting blown out whenever he was on the floor and on top of all this he had an awful night shooting against us."
Kyle Lowry is absolutely not underrated on r/nba lol
"Tyler herro also looks like a real hard worker. Always making the hustle plays, playing the ""right"" way. Kyle lowry now, very athletic, some may even say, genetically athletic."
"He's underrated in general because he played in Canada.  But the Paul comparison isn't right in this case. Kyle took until his 8th season to be who he is, CP3 was that since he was a rookie, he has been an elite PG for 17 years. Which is double the amount of Lowry."
"Yeah, that‚Äôs why my opinion of Kyle Lowry is still extremely high. That being said I‚Äôm not going to say he‚Äôs having an excellent start this year. I have a higher expectation of him than 7.7 ppg in 30% shooting and 19% from 3."

I mean are you surprised?  The only time any NBA casual here has watched Kyle Lowry was during the 2018 Finals.
"Come one, come all to the Small Sample Size Theatre!   Last week‚Äôs show featured James Harden. This week: Kyle Lowry!"
Out goes our GROAT Kyle Lowry and in comes his successor Scottie Barnes.
"I think he's more of a floor general type than bucket getter. I think he'll have a Kyle Lowry type of game, but probably not as good of a 3 point shooter."
"It looks like it's helping his playmaking, he makes some Kyle Lowry like passes and pushes up the tempo of the game. He's made leaps with decision making and his ball handling"
Kyle hasn't been shooting well but he's been instrumental this season. I love Dragic but the way Lowry controls the offense has been noticeably better.

"this heat defense + kyle lowry getting into rhythm on offense will be a serious contender to make it out of the east. i‚Äôm not sure they aren‚Äôt already a real contender man, they made us look like kids at times. Bam is legit, Jimmy is legit, Tyler herro killed us. I will say, the hornets 2 years ago or even last year would have absolutely just given up. glad to see the team actually have some fight up until the end. GG Heat, y‚Äôall earned that."
"+- doesn‚Äôt mean shit if Kyle Lowry can shoot 2-10, go 0-4 from 3, and score 4 points in 36 minutes and still come out with a +11"
If Masai gets a statue before Kyle that's well deserved. Kyle Lowry is the greatest Raptor but without Masai we would still be fighting with the Kings and Magic for worst managed team in the league. Everything this team has done in the past decade is Masai and Tim Leiweke.
He's getting paid a pile of money he doesn't deserve...a pile of money the Heat offered him solely to use him as matching salary. That decision helped net them Kyle Lowry.   I'd say getting your guy way more than he's worth is good agenting.
"Kyle who? Don‚Äôt say Lowry because no the lakers couldn‚Äôt afford kyrie and get demar/Caruso. Kyle was an expiring and would have cost the lakers every asset they had with no guarantee he stays. On top of that he wanted a two year max   You‚Äôre overreacting to the first 5 games of a team that has 9 new members to the squad. AD is looking a lot better than last year, the fact AD and Westbrook got a win while lebron sat out is massive. Last year the lakers would have been on a guaranteed slide any minute lebron sits out. Now he can actually rest and not have to worry about rushing back to maybe fight for the 8th seed"
"Paywall   Heat, P.J. Tucker not interested in hype, just beating opponents to a pulp  Ira Winderman South Florida Sun Sentinel  Oct 28, 2021 at 9:07 AM  MIAMI ‚Äî P.J. Tucker did not arrive to the Miami Heat as some sort of promotional vehicle, even with his build as a compact Mack Truck.  So while Heat Nation, Heat Culture, The Kennel and other buzzwords have become part of the Miami Heat lexicon, the 6-foot-5, 245-pound veteran power forward shoos them aside, just as he does opposing big men when fighting for rebounds.  With the Heat at 3-1 after Wednesday night‚Äôs 106-93 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, Tucker bodied up against early-season Heat hype with the same vigor he utilized in defending Kevin Durant at Barclays Center.  ‚ÄúAs players, you don‚Äôt think about it like that,‚Äù Tucker said of the catchphrases that supposedly crystalize and define this season‚Äôs Heat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòOh, he‚Äôs a dog.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like an energy.

We just play.‚Äù  If anything, Tucker said, it is as simple as a matter of trust, that with so many quality individual defenders alongside, including Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry, there is no second thought about switching on defense and allowing a teammate to momentarily handle a challenge such as Durant.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be on a team where you can really be happy to trade off,‚Äù Tucker said. ‚ÄúI can be on KD and Bam will switch, and I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòcool.‚Äô Jimmy will switch, I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòcool.‚Äô Kyle will switch, it‚Äôs like ‚Äòcool.‚Äô  ‚ÄúI know what those guys are going to do. They‚Äôre going to play hard, they‚Äôre going to give everything they got. Whether they score or not, do it again the next possession and we can talk to each other. Bam can say whatever to me, I can say whatever to him, and then we can yell at each other, and then go out there and we‚Äôre going to play and it‚Äôs done. To have that kind of chemistry with guys this early in the season, it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù  With the NBA back to a typical 82-game schedule after regular seasons were reduced to 73 and 72 games the past two years by the pandemic, the reality is the Heat are just a single week in, as they turn their attention to Friday‚Äôs visit by the Charlotte Hornets to FTX Arena.  ‚ÄúWho cares, man?‚Äù Tucker said when asked about quality victories over a pair of Eastern Conference favorites, in the Bucks and Nets. ‚ÄúListen, man, we just played our fourth game. We got to build. We‚Äôre going to go through some stretches where we‚Äôre going to be bad. It‚Äôs just not going to be good. But it‚Äôs how we come out of that.  ‚ÄúLike [Wednesday], they took the lead. We could have given up and been like, ‚ÄòAw.‚Äô But we fought. To get that this early in the season, it‚Äôs nice regardless of how the game went, the refs, shots made, shots missed. I just like our competitiveness and how much we fought. This early in the season, that‚Äôs all you can ask for.‚Äù  Since the start of the season, Adebayo has spoken of how the Heat have come to view the locker room as a kennel, a place for hungry dogs, or dawgs, to fight their way to respect.  Such is the impetuousness of a 24-year-old.  But when the analogy was raised to Butler, 32, he rolled his eyes as he shared a glance at Tucker, 36."
"Of the ballers I follow, Kyle Lowry and Rudy Gobert"
Kyle Lowry ain't no spot-up shooter started out in exactly the same fashion..... Still going strong üòÇ
"Things to like:  We strapped in and after being down 25-5 came back.   Jalen is looking GREAT! If he can be a secondary ball handler and do 16/4/6 then that‚Äôs what we need. I‚Äôve said for over a year now he has the potential to be Kyle Lowry.  Maxi! Looked great! He won‚Äôt do that every game but he always brings defense and can score  The defense as a whole looked very good and has post hawks. I saw deflections, tipped balls, steals, blocks, shot clock violations, and even just really good man defense from guys that knocked the Spurs out of rhythm  Luka shot pretty well besides‚Ä¶  God damn free throws! We play again tomorrow but at our next practice each guy shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to leave until they make 100 this is ridiculous. If we were 10/14 (72%) we win this game by 10 points. Ugh.  The team still hasn‚Äôt quite found their rhythm yet, but we‚Äôre 3-1, I‚Äôll take it"
"Even with all the criticism the Lakers are getting for it.. I think it‚Äôs still understated how dumb it was to not resign Caruso.  And too not trade KCP, Trezz, and THT for Kyle Lowry. They could‚Äôve easily kept Caruso and had a better fit for the team in Kyle Lowry than Westbrook."
Even hotter take. Kyle Lowry and Oladipo
