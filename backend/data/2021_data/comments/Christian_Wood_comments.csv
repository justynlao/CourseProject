"It's Christian Wood. You can make the argument of ""good stats on bad teams"" but the Rockets are a higher seed than GSW right now lol. Also Wood has a very strong chance of being an All-Star this year and that'd help the case more.  Wood jumped up 10 PPG on elite efficiency. Grant made a sizable scoring  jump but his efficiency has been going down the past few years."
"Huh?  He's not very different from his typical career season.  Your numbers are off too.  The only major difference is he's been shooting the 3-ball better, but that is more likely a hot streak than something sustainable.  Bottom line, he's not even a candidate.  Jerami Grant or Christian Wood look like leading contenders right now.  Jaylen Brown has a strong argument too, but he won't get the award given his steady development path."
Christian wood better
Imo it should be Christian wood. Love that guy and his mentality. Jaylen brown and Julius Randle are the other candidates if any
I mean look at Christian Wood  He’s  putting up the numbers he put up here after he finally got the start.  I imagine even with help Grant would still be putting up the same numbers and still be either our 1 or 2 option
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood are better picks
"DeMarcus told a women he was going to put a bullet through her head. He’s been an asshole his whole career, routinely trying to hurt other players on the court, and bullying teammates off the court. Root for a Christian Wood or literally anyone else but DeMarcus to dunk on Harden. The only reason people have any respect for him is because they’re tricked by a cute nickname."
Christian Wood
Any chance we can drug your GM and swindle Christian Wood for Kelly Oubre?
If you want to go off this season alone then Christian wood &gt; FVV
"Harden pushed the Rockets to the top, they were bad to oj without him up until now but contenders with him. You don't think Christian Wood is gonna carry the Rockets past LeBron and AD, do you?  The Wizards are this bad *in spite of* Beal, not because of him. Man is a walking bucket and the team would be historically bad without him instead of just awful"
"Yeah, I know that.   I just think it would've been better if they handed Christian Wood that contract instead of giving Meyers Leonard that contract just to use him as salary filler.   That's only in hindsight though. I understand they were gearing up to go after Giannis."
Meyers Leonard for Christian Wood :^)
"The Heat must be wondering why they didn't throw Christian Wood a contract.   Wishing Meyers a speedy recovery, but what a terrible contract."
"Pascal Siakam is a better player than Christian Wood. Wood is a better volume scorer and Siakam is playing a role he can’t play, so Wood has been better than Siakam this season, and I would even say for a good portion of last season. But put Siakam in a position like his 2018-19 role as an elite switching lockdown defender with 17 super efficient points, deadly scoring on fast breaks making up a large amount of his offense, and a teammate with the bulk of the load, and it’s not even close."

We really shouldn't have. I can see him being a Christian Wood type guy in a few years where people are wondering how he ever got cut.
"Yeah but this isn’t last year. And like I said, the bubble doesn’t even count. Look at the Nuggets, you think they’re making the WCF? No.  Shit has changed since last season. And the West top to bottom is still better than the East. Our 9-10 seeds would be a 6-8 seed in your conference  And you can have Oladipo! He’s nothing to us, we got Christian Wood. Everyone else is expendable after him dawg 😂"
"the game is very different now than it was over a decade ago, so not sure how in game experience/film study/prep is relevant when Shaq and Chuck go on their diatribes. These guys use numbers too btw. Just in the box score.  Shaq didn't even know who Christian Wood was but you're telling me you trust him over someone willing to study rosters and analytics, while watching basketball games too."
"this is funny   Middleton at 11? Butler at 31? what?  jokic at 3?  Gobert isn’t top 20.   No way Zion is 34, way worse than that.  KAT at 35? lmfao  Christian Wood is balling. having him barely top 50 is disrespectful, same to Randle.  this gotta be a joke, right?  edit: and that’s just a skim through of the top 50 lmao. this could be worse than espn arguably"
"I think Shareef will be in the league, maybe as a bench warmer, in about 2-5 years. The heart issue probably takes time to heal from physically and mentally. He has the tools though being 6'9"" - 6'10 (still growing?) and able to dribble a bit, shoot a bit with athleticism. He was a late bloomer in high school. He could easily be the next Christian Wood player that takes time to develop. Or he will be Perry Jones/Isaiah Austin.   Bronny is still what, a sophmore? His physical growth spurt is obvious. And Gilbert Arenas trained him for a bit and I think will continue training him in the future. Agent Zero speaks highly of his potential."
"I like Christian wood...a lot. But I have reservations about wall and dipo holding up after their injuries. Not that I expect them to get hurt, but more likely hit the injury wall (no pun intended)"
If we’re talking predictions Zion will 100% get the vote over Christian wood  Booker doesn’t really have all star case right now that can change but as of today he shouldn’t be in. And last year there had to be an injury for him to get in so I don’t think the voters are gonna be naturally biased towards him
Christian Wood is an all star. Book it.
*Harden had John Wall and Christian Wood
"John Wall, Christian Wood, Oladipo, the ghost of Boogie..... this doesn't surprise me"
"Much different when that team has players like Eric Gordon, Oladipo, Wall and Christian Wood"
"correct, and we made the trade in the first place to use one of those picks to get Christian Wood  rafael stone an absolute criminal for this one"
"no cap room this year to do that. would have had to work some magic. i personally wanted christian wood and wanted to get rid of whoever to do it, but alas, we didn’t do that. and now he’s playing incredible in houston. imagine him rick rolling with luka instead of WCS"

0% chance Shaq knows who Yuta Watanabe is.  He just found out who Christian Wood is like a week ago.
"Who is he pushing out  West starters Steph Curry/Damien Lillard/Leonard/LeBron/Jokic  Backups Donovan Mitchell/Doncic/PG13/AD/Gobert  For the final two spots he needs to beat all but one of Karl Anthony Towns, SGA, De'Aron Fox, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, Ja Morant  On his own team Wall, Wood, and Gordon are all better than him too"
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
How dare you disrespect Christian Wood this way
I wish I was Christian Wood.

"You just know Christian Wood is packing some heat, he lowkey strong as hell"
I wish I was Christian Wood
"Plenty of players have a year where they put up great numbers on a bad team, such as Christian Wood on the Pistons. This dude is legit though. He goes to a new team in rebuild-mode and immediately becomes the most important player. He’s going to be an all star and he’s going to keep getting better. Easily one of my top 3 favorite young players, and I hate the Rockets, so that says a lot."
CHRISTIAN WOOD 😍😍😍
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Lakers will be a 4th seed at best this year. Nuggets, Jazz, and Clippers will be top 3. Jokic will win mvp. Rockets will be the 5th seed, and Christian Wood will get snubbed on being an all star even though he will be more deserving than Zion."
He's a casual - Christian Wood
"Wolves just don’t have a lot of eyes on them. Plus there’s already a crowded field of candidates like Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, SGA, and Jerami Grant taking up most of the mip discussion"
they have one all star lmao and it's christian wood
the disrespect on christian wood does not stop. man is not a role player...
Wait Christian Wood was with Okafor during that scuffle?
People in this sub really telling me Christian Wood better than Siakam lol.
"Pascal was checking reddit at half time, reading the thread about how Christian Wood was better than him"
The Christian Wood hype train is in overdrive rn
"Lakers have AD, Trez, Gasol. Milwaukee has Jrue and Khris. Nets have KD and Kyrie. All of those are way better than Christian Wood."
Sixers fan here who is looking at both of them crying we never got that production out of them(granted they were rookies/early in development) love seeing them play so well though always loved both of them when they were here. Always said Christian Wood would end up being good always passed eye test to me and tried his butt off. Plus was decent shooter or at least could see that he had the potential when he was here!
christian wood
Christian Wood is shooting 38% on 4.7 attempts per game btw
True Christian Wood has brought the center position back
Best offseason acquisition by any team? I'd say Christian Wood wins that one handedly
Christian Wood is on a decent team though. But yeah he also gets too many threads.  It's just a circlejerk rn and everyone piles on because it's popular. One day the pendulum will swing though. Idc
Christian Wood
that’s how i feel about christian wood posts tbh
Christian Wood gotta be the best Big you guys have ever had
If Christian Wood gets a thread everytime he scores 20 points we can hear about Jerami Grant occasionally lol
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood. Not ashamed to admit that I thought the highlight of Christian Wood's career would be backing up Jahlil Okafor as they were punching out drunkards outside a Boston nightclub.
"Jermi Grant vs. Christian Wood.    Jermi Grant might end up being a star, INSANE"

christian wood better be ready to face the best post defender in the game 😤
Christian Wood beats out Zion for a spot this year imo.
"This is excellent. He'll re-find his love for the game. His confidence is rotting watching younger players usurp his minutes with less talent. He knows it's about the work now. He's learned professional lessons. He took it too personally when Luka stole his team away as a doughy white guy. Then got boo'd by new york's own fans on home court after the trade. He's gonna be back - look at Trey Burke, Chris Boucher, Norm Powell, Van Vleet, Keldon Johnson, Christian Wood. Jerami Grant. at least 40% of the NBA is situation &amp; time."
"Minnesota got a 1st and Beasley/Juancho/Vanderbilt for Covington.  Rockets got 2 firsts and Ariza when they traded RoCo, then they swapped one of the firsts, a 2027 2nd rounder, and Ariza for Christian Wood, a first round pick, and a Detroit 2021 second round pick that looks like it'll be the 31st pick in the draft.  Not only did they mess up the Butler trade, somehow the Rockets made out like bandits with what they got for Roco comparatively."
"Facts. Don't let their record fool you, the lakers are the ones who need to be worrying. LeBron has taken a step back and AD is just a Walmart Christian Wood."
Oladipo needs to stop ball hogging and feed the boy  Signed-  Christian Wood fantasy owner
A team with a Christian wood and Zion frontcourt would score and give up 200 points a game
"If Christian Wood were a free agent this offseason, would he be a max player?   25yo, putting up 23/11 on 55/38/70 and good defense thus far?"
"“Oh man, You’re a casual” -Christian Wood"
Christian Wood remembered he was cut by New Orleans to sign Nicolo Melli
"Christian Wood? No, he JESUS LOG."
Christian Wood for Most Improved and Jae'Sean Tate for All-Rookie 1st Team let's goooo....    And maybe Silas for Coach of the Year
All I know is Christian Wood should be an all star
"Imagine not taking 5 minutes of your day to vote for Christian Wood, John Wall, and Victor Oladipo to be NBA All-Stars in 2021 lmao couldn't be me."
Is Christian Wood the GOAT?  Think about it.
Go vote Christian Wood.
Christian Wood is Anthony Davis combined with Kevin Durant. GOD MODE
CHRISTIAN WOOD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ZION
Christian Wood coming in to remind us we should never have cut him tonight
Christian Wood was second in the league in scoring and rebounding in 2019. He was named to the all g league third team.
Christian Wood = The Crucifix
Over Christian Wood? LOL
"Jerami Grant last season averaged 12ppg off the bench for the Nuggets, he shot 38% from 3 on 3.5 attempts a game  Jerami Grant this season is averaging 24ppg, and shooting 40% from 3 currently on almost double the volume. Dude has become a legit 1st option out of nowhere  Christian Wood went from 13ppg to a 23/10 double-double machine.  Keldon Johnson is great, but he's only gone from 9ppg to 14ppg. I don't see how he has a strong case for MIP over Grant or Wood."
Christian Wood  Grant  Randle
Christian Wood will win it.
2nd year players do not really win MIP. And compared to people leading the race like Jerami Grant and Christian Wood his case isn’t as strong.
Julius Randle   Christian Wood   Jerami Grant
They'll get votes but I think at the moment it's between Christian Wood and Jerami Grant.
"john wall, christian wood, demarcus cousins, pj tucker, danuel house, sterling brown, tate at some point is word. all houston rockets"
"Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Brad Wanamaker, Christian Wood, James Harden"
"I honestly think the current rockets in their prime would be really good. Prime Boggie Cousins, John wall, Oladipo, Tucker, Eric Gordon, along with Christian wood and the rest of the roster"
Christian Wood age: 25y 162d.  Kelly Oubre Jr. age: 25y 89d.
"Why would a contender not trade for him with his current contract? It’s an expiring. I know we aren’t a contender but we’re gunning for the playoffs, and Drummond is young enough to not need to go ring chasing. We could send James Johnson, Powell and a 2nd to the Cavs, they get a pick, and then we have bird rights to sign him to a more 3/40 or something? I have no idea what he’s worth next year, likely less than Christian wood, but still."
"5 years is a long time.  5 years ago, the Clippers had CP3, Blake, and DJ.   4 years ago, they traded CP3  3 Years ago, they traded Blake.   One year out of the playoffs   Then back in. And we didn't have anyone has good as John Wall or Christian Wood on the team that year."
All I’m saying is Christian Wood would’ve made that
"No it’s not. It’s not 2021 Christian Wood, Jerami Grant and RoCo... it’s 5 years ago. I watched a bunch of the games and they were all raw... they had potential but they certainly weren’t competent players in 2016"
"Shows how much Christian Wood carried them. They were 6-0 as soon as Harden left, them 0-13 as soon as Wood got hurt."
"So why don't they do it? You're also underestimating what kind of hell the sixers were in after the bynum trade. no picks, no chance for any success and no cap space. The sixers playoff drought was shorter than the Lakers and they made it back to the postseason before them. Same amount of high lottery picks as them during that span, and without getting lucky that lebron wanted to go there. They went from a 10 win team to a 50 win team in 2 years because of their draft and talent evaluation. Can't say it didn't work. Look at the people hinkie brought into the league(embiid aside) on that process team. Saric, covington, grant, tj mcconnell, christian wood are all good starters or big contributers to their team. It was 2-3 years of collecting draft capital and freeing up cap. Colangelo and brand wasted all that flexibility and they are still competing bc the tanking got them ben and embiid."
I thought it was going to be a fun race between him and Christian Wood before he got injured.
"Normally I’d say “Call OKC!” But DET can’t even trade a 1st period because of the Christian Wood trade. The language on a pick swap would have to be so ridiculous because of the pick they owe HOU.  That being said, LMA+Lyles to DET, Horford to SAS, and Blake to OKC would work salary-wise if the draft compensation to OKC could be worked out"
"We lost a lot in the regular season without him especially since AD is injured. Gasol and Matthews are underperforming, but I honestly think if Marc gets a few more touches and we figure out when to play him, we’ll improve. Matthews is looking hopeless but I have faith in Vogel - we started out last year with few injuries and still hit a massive loss streak.  We’ve definitely hit a slump but we will be winning a lot of games in April once AD is for sure fully healed and we get back in the swing of things. He was still going off in the most important games of the season prior to injury - destroyed Christian Wood (I want AD lol) and put up big numbers against Chicago in his home state and the Celtics. We’re gonna be fine come playoffs if everyone is healthy."
"Y’all have Christian Wood, when he’s healthy he’s been great"
"RoCo, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, TJ and Christian Wood were all on our 10-72 roster. Also Nerlens and Jah but we don't talk about them"
"Pistons fan here. The Bruce trade helped us get Saddiq Bey, and Christian Wood didn't want to be here."
And Christian Wood
"Christian Wood being out has given his team more losses than Kevin Durant, is Christian Wood the MVP??"
Christian Wood better make a 4th quarter surprise return or this may have the lowest second half national TV ratings of all time.
bro what lmao christian wood ain't getting in relax
"I feel like Shaq and those of his mindset are what's helping drive ratings down. They don't give new stars their dues and are always talking shit about the past.   This man called Luka hitting a dagger in the playoffs ""meh"" and doesn't know who Christian Wood is."
christian wood
Correct but Christian wood is arguably Houston's future franchise player. The Wizards would have lost a lot of games with Westbrook playing if Beal sat out for 6 weeks.
"Yeah, they started losing after Christian Wood got hurt"
"The “defensive raptor” rating is famously unreliable. Has poetl as its highest rated defensive player; with Conley, Isaiah Stewart, Christian wood, and Rudy Gay all in the top 10. Would really only use offensive raptor rating, if you’re going to use it at all."
christian wood calling shaq a casual is 100% facts
Lol if you replace Gasol with Jarret Allen or Christian Wood they would sleep walk to a title the teams already one of the most stacked in league any top 20 player would make them dominate.
"Christian Wood is already injured, I don't see why we have to knock against him to support Giannis"
"Christian Wood came in as a 4 but he plays the 5 full time.  Marvin Bagley was drafted as a 4 and he starts at the 4 for SAC, but I feel like he'll transition to the 5 once he shores up his defense."
Christian Wood
What the hell is going on here haha  All these combos and then Christian wood 2023? What does this mean
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Apparently mentioning any signing by the pistons constitutes shitting on them. Who hurt you? Besides Christian Wood.
Do you feel that way about Christian Wood as well?
"Detroit Pistons reviving careers, Christian Wood, Josh Jackson, now hopefully DSJ"
"Yeah thinking about it, the perfect fit are guys that come to mind are people you’d build around in their own, like a KAT or AD who are a little more on the perimeter than Embiid  To be honest I hadn’t watched many rockets or pistons games, but I’d imagine this version of Christian Wood would fit pretty nice with Ben on offense and defense. But even he was basically an all star himself"
"I mean, I’m not really gonna give the Sixers credit for Christian Wood or even really Jerami Grant tbh"
"Christian Wood, Robert Covington, Jeremi Grant, there's actually quite a few"
"I've been saying that the issue is Ainge.  His overall drafting and acquisitions have been atrocious.   I look at the teams that are contenders.  They have their superstar(s) but the also have good/great supporting cast and depth.  What I see is their players are athletic, have length,  good ball handle handlers and great-good rebounders and their players have a combination of these things. I look as our roster and dont see anyone with the above mentioned except maybe Robert Williams. Ainge got rid of Kanter and even Poirie(sp) so now we get bullied under the boards.   He wanted more versatile 5s then decided to get Thompson who is average at best.  He put on too much weight and lost his leaping ability.    We could have gotten Christian Wood for cheap!!!! Imagine getting close to 20 points from him and 10 rebounds? Also,  he can spread the floor.   I think Montrezl Harrell was a affordable contract.  He's a bad man, a Marcus Smart type with more size.  I think I'd rather have him than Thies(sp) or Thompson.  We could have gotten Dwight Howard,  Javale McGee cheap and Whiteside for nothing!! Rondo would have been better than Teague and if Ainge had the foresight,  he would have gotten D. Rose from Detroit.  How come Ainge cant find the Browns(Nets), Caruso(Lakers) and other so called no-name players who are playing lights-out????  Speaking of foresight, he drafts Grant William's and Carson Edward's but the are sitting or not being the kind of contributors we need.  We let Max Straus go he he's playing well.  What about drafting Neismith but haven't been giving him time to develop? We could have gotten Bey and we also gave Memphis Bane who has the best 3 point percentage of the rookies.   Tatum and Brown are good-great players at times but they are too young.  Kobe needed Shaq he got really good, where the y just needed to surround him with the right roll players.  I think we miss Hayward more than we think.  His years of experience plus the ability to give us 20 points at any night is a plus.  Kemba is going down hill and doesn't have the explosiveness quickness like J. Morant or Fox.  He's a defensive liability and that's bad for a team known for defense.  We miss Horford and also Crowders tough ess.  We have 2 choices.  Either chalk this year and play the young guys so they have experience and also to see who they should keep. Second,  they can make some moves like sending picks and players to get someone who can contribute more than what we have.  Would it be possible to get Rose and Knox for Kemba, Thompson or Thies and our trade exception?   What about 2-1st rounders,  Kemba and Thompson for Turner and Warren?     Steven's can do better but he's dealing with the hand Ainge gave and continues to give him.  Gros said sometime ago that he would go over the luxury tax to be competitive.....well, let's see if he's serious"
"Bruh mine has been decimated. Christian Wood, PG, Thomas Bryant, Kawhi, D'Lo... I could keep going but I have like 5 dudes out at like any given time"
I think Christian Wood or Dejounte Murray can take that MIP award then
I guess christian wood was right
"How do you even fix Jokic's glaring defensive deficiencies?  Pick up a talented and versatile 6' 8""+ two-way player  that can check small ball fives and has the length and lateral quickness to rotate swiftly from the weak side corner to help contest interior shots?  How many of those players are even available?   Robert Covington, Christian Wood, and John Collins?  Oh, wait, they allowed someone who fit that mold perfectly that shined in the bubble to simply walk away."
"Ugh my fantasy team....what a mess this year. Covid protocol and postponed games, AD and Christian Wood missing a bunch of games, now Beasley is suspended. RIP Team Potato's title chances 2021."
"Yeah, could've been something with a healthy Christian Wood, now it's just tank SZN."
I got into an argument with Houston fans who said they preferred taking the Nets deal because they can easily draft a better player than Ben and Christian Wood is better than him. I legit thought they were tillman's burners.
"I think he went expecting to be a starter and then Christian Wood happened.  Unhappy Boogie is not a good Boogie to have around, I guess.  Sad that the much-hyped Kentucky reunion with Wall didn't go as well as hoped."
"As a D lo fan, outside wanting to see him more with KAT, I would love him with guys like Christian Wood, Bam, and Sabonis. I feel like their PnR abilities would help him as a scorer and passer. He already played with Jarret Allen, but him with Allen again could be fun and effective."
"He has the same drawback as Christian Wood for MIP - both of them showed their cards too early last season.  Beasley starting last year: 21 pts 5 reb, 2 ast, 47/43/75 splits.  Wood starting last year: 22 pts, 9 reb, 2 ast, 56/41/73 splits.  So they're not seen as improving as much *this season* as Grant.  For comparison, Grant starting last year: 14 pts, 4 ten, 2 ast, 48/39/84 splits"
"Yeah grant is 1st almost everywhere, Christian wood is 2nd-3rd on most tho"
Is it a runaway win for grant? I'd go Christian Wood
"Christian Wood nailed it when he called Shaq a casual. He's not even a good fan, much less an analyst with deep insight into the current game."
I got into an argument with some dude who believes Christian Wood is a better player because Ben can't shoot
"In my definitely 100% not biased opinion, should've been Christian Wood"
"&gt;Christian Wood 3rd? I know Porzingis hasn't been as good recently but he's averaging very similar numbers to Wood even after injury  Wood plays really good defense, just look how the rockets have collapsed with him out. Also he scores way more efficiently"
"Embiid (29.8 pts on 65.2% TS) and Jokic (27 pts on 65% TS), that's it. At least somewhere in the vicinity is Christian Wood with 22 pts on 63.4% TS."
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"To be honest, I'm just pointing out the absurdity of this many players being listed as a ""snub."" I'm listing names that I've seen suggested here and on social media. [If you look at the comments here, Christian Wood himself commented and a bunch of people agreed.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLp5e7iJYCH/)"
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
Christian Wood is getting overrated real quick huh
1. Bam Adebayo   2. Christian Wood   3. Ben Simmons   4. Pascal Siakam   6. Jerami Grant
1. Ben Simmons 2. Bam Adebayo  3. Pascal Siakam 4. Jerami Grant  5. Christian Wood
Christian Wood 3rd? I know Porzingis hasn't been as good recently but he's averaging very similar numbers to Wood even after injury
"We're still having a losing season, but it's the Pistons most enjoyable season in a long time and yeah I include the 2 playoffs seasons.  Besides Hayes our young players play well, our acquisitions that I was sure we were overpaying have been fine, most of the reclamation projects have been decent (even DSJ), and we'll have a high draft pick at the end of the year.  I gotta apologize to Troy Weaver after killing him in the offseason (still would love to have Christian Wood instead of Mason Plumlee and the stretch of Dedmon tho)"
"Man there are only 12 spots. I don’t like how guys react to being snubbed unless you were OBVIOUSLY snubbed like Booker and Sabonis. tobias putting out song, cryptic messages, his father sending out text to the Athletic, Christian wood sending out public complaints and whatnot. I think they should be more like Gordon Hayward. He was asked about it multiple times and dude made it clear that his main focus is to help the team make the playoffs, not the asg. Same with sabonis, didn’t put out any complaints and whatnot. Only 12 spots and there are like 20 guys that deserve it."
"Montrezl Harrell is probably the prime outlier. Christian Wood, Bam Adebayo, and Chris Boucher are also all relatively small among centers."
"christian wood or not the rockets are garbage   in the rockets first 20 games they beat the pistons, magic, thunder, pelicans, kings, grizzlies, wizards   the rest of the schedule ain't that easy  welcome to the nba"
"Christian Wood, Trae"
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
Fuck no Christian Wood :(
"You do realize this is just one example right? I would love to hear why you think Carmelo Anthony deserves 31 votes, 4 less than Gobert and 2 more than Christian Wood"
Thats what I would think they would do. Maybe the inevitable backlash and narrative that Booker was snubbed will allow him in like last year. Personally I hope Derozan or Christian Wood get in.
Christian Wood
"Zion over Brandon Ingram, Demar Derozean, Devin Booker, Deaaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Christian Wood, John Wall, and so many others? I don't agree. Zion's game is limited and his team isn't good. How do the Spurs not have one all star? They're the fifth seed!"
Christian Wood over AD or Zion
Christian Wood robbed
"SVG often says the hardest thing to coach in the NBA is the declining or washed star. It's very true here as I was hinting at with the idea he's pissed he has to backup Christian Wood. From his perspective it's ""Yeah my body isnt the same but I still have all the same skills I developed over the years no reason why I still cant be really good"" and it just doesnt work that way past a point(which we've reached)."
"Why would Houston, who by most reports is looking to shave cash, take on Porzingis and the almost $100M he's still owed? Especially with Christian Wood looking like their future?  But sure, that'd be a great trade for Dallas."
"Yes, he’s literally averaging just 1 assist more. It’s not about the numbers, they don’t count him because of the way he left Houston.  He saw the writing on the wall and called it out. Did you honestly think Harden + John Wall + Christian Wood + Demarcus Cousins is getting past Bron and AD? If he’s stayed, it would have hurt his career more."
"Absolutely. Heck, Christian Wood was a nobody barely in the league when he turned 24. It happens. But it's a bit rare, and if it's going to happen for Patton, it needs to happen pretty quick."
"I don't believe this source. This comes off as a pretty shameful attempt for the Rockets FO to avoid criticism for releasing a popular player mid-season.  Like OP briefly mentioned, these were Cousins' comments prior to the season quoted by, guess who, Tim MacMahon:  &gt; 4-time All-Star DeMarcus Cousins says he'd be ""totally fine"" coming off bench in Houston: ""If my name is called to be a sixth man coming off the bench, I’ll do my job. My concern is making sure everybody in this locker room is together, coming in ready to work every single day.""  &gt; Cousins on Christian Wood, who signed  a 3-year, $41M deal w/ HOU despite having only 14 career starts: ""I’m here to help C Wood get better every single day. He’s been a sponge since he stepped into the building, and you can’t ask for anything more coming from a young player."" [Source](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1336755592694784003)  Seems pretty shady for MacMahon to report this news today without even mentioning his own previous reporting on this exact subject. He would rather help Rockets FO's public relations than engage in standard journalistic scrutiny.   Also makes little sense for this report to come out now, given that Cousins has indeed been starting since Wood is hurt."
"If he wants to start over Christian Wood, he's going to want 35mpg when his competition is Cody Zeller."
"it's been weird, they guaranteed his contract a week ago and then this weekend they started looking to trade or waive him.  supposedly the FO wanted to reward him for being so professional (sounds like something the agent fed the media)... also Christian Wood is going to be back soon, so they'd rather develop their younger players."
"Regardless of how you rate Simmons, he is an All-NBA level player with DPoY level defense in the first year of a 5 year extension. That is a way more valuable asset to build around or even flip for picks later on than praying the Nets suck for 5 years which is a pipe dream. In the meantime, the Rockets won't even sniff the playoffs and OKC will be salivating over the lottery picks they're gonna get. Rockets should have 0 incentive to tank and should have taken Simmons. Christian Wood would have been the perfect Center to pair him with and a couple of smart signings in the FA and you easily would've been in the playoffs as early as next year.   You don't know how difficult it is to be a playoff caliber team because Harden could carry garbage to June. Also it isn't easy to draft a Simmons caliber player. The Sixers tanked for 5 years and he was the second best player they got out of multiple lottery picks. Imagine being confident you can draft a better player from picks which aren't even guaranteed to be lottery.   You obviously don't watch enough basketball if you rate Simmons so low. He is a top 15 player in the league, 20 if you wanna stretch it. Even your own GM was leaning towards the Sixers offer before Fertitta put his foot down.   Taking my own personal opinion on Simmons' ability aside, it is a bad business decision to turn down the best offer on the table."
We desperately need Christian Wood back
"Houston sports have been rough lately  KPJ, Tate, Christian Wood and John Wall are the only bright spots in this weird season"
"He has a better shot at the MIP than 6th man in my opinion.    Look at it historically, Bocuher would need to be getting a lot more shots to get the 17-20 PPG he'd need to pull down the MIP, but if he start getting starting minutes he might get to 13-14 shots and might get up to 18 PPG which puts him in the discussion.  The Blocks will help and might get him some traction but Jerami Grant is putting up 23 PPG right now on 18 shots.  He's running away with it.   Christian Wood also has a good shot, but he's been injured, so if he doesn't play 40+ games, he might not get it.  Some people have Jaylen Brown in the mix, but I don't see them giving the award to someone who went from 20 to 25 PPG.  I think Bocuher comes in 3rd unless both Wood and Grant come back down to earth or miss too many games."
Suprised no mention of Christian Wood
Christian Wood aka “The Crucifix” is the standard bearer
Christian Wood played in the Jazz v Pistons game before that incident with FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS you guys can shit on Gobert for touching the mics but Wood is probably the guy that gave it to him (and Mitchell)
But why don’t the Rockets want to keep Boogie is my question ? Who else do they have for that spot now that Christian Wood is hurt ?
"Why do they want to go smaller, seems like they should want to stay big, seeing as 3-4 of the top 5 big men in the league play in the west. Cousins seems like a decent counter against someone like Jokic, obviously not going to contain him, but could slow him down. Same against Davis and Gobert. Christian wood is talented on both ends but he just isn't there on the physicality side of things imo. Just an odd move I think."
we have christian wood
"He's the go-to source for fantasy basketball. Pretty much the only one anyone listens to as far as I know, and for good reason. He knows the game well and is pretty good at evaluating draft prospects and upcoming players too.   For example, he had LaMelo at number 1 on his board pretty much from the beginning. He called out Christian Wood as a potential breakout player 2 or 3 years ago, way before he was actually a productive NBA player."
"I dont want serious analysis, but I do want NBA analysts who at least know who is playing. Siakam was an all star and a recent champion; no excuses there. Christian Wood was mentioned on every basketball outlet for months."
"Nail your draft picks.  Try to trade as many of Wall/Gordon/Oladipo as you can without giving up much (ideally anything), maybe Oladipo will sign a cheaper deal after his injuries, maybe a 1 year prove it deal while knowing you'll move him to a contender. This way he has value to a contender, maybe get a pick out of him.  Develop Christian Wood, he looks like a very good player so far. I know he's older than a rookie but he's a definite all star level player.  Nail your draft picks, get valuable players on cheap contracts. Go from there.  Hope your new coach is good."
Yeah part of this is how its defined.   BBall ref its 3 feet and in for shots at the rim. Giannis 82.3% there  CTG uses within 4 feet. Giannis is 79% there. They actually only have that as 90th percentile surprisingly. Someone like Bam per their tracking data is actually very slightly ahead of Giannis right now. Christian Wood isa ctually at 82%. Cory Joseph is at 80%
"Do not resign Oladipo, Gordon, Wall or Cousins to any longterm deals. They are here to hold the line and won't be part of the next rebuild. Try to get assets and maybe trade Tucker.  Christian Wood is the only player that shows promise on this roster."
"By that logic, the players voted for Carmelo over Christian Wood, we should probably take away their vote too"
"How tf is he paid to be an announcer, didn’t know Christian wood either"
Christian Wood called Shaq a casual
Throwback to when Christian Wood said that Shaq is a casual.
I was expecting christian wood
"Christian Wood, team lost 20 games without him. All these other stats are nothing."
"Here's his break down on Boucher:   &gt; I do think Chris Boucher has been the Most Improved Player, and not entirely just because he’s played 48 games to the 24 of Christian Wood. The Toronto Raptors have been slowly bringing Boucher along for a couple of seasons now, and we’ve seen a vast improvement in everything he’s doing. He’s a legitimate Sixth Man for the Raptors. He’s a defensive presence, especially around the rim. He’s turned himself into a real threat around the rim, a real 3-point shooter, and someone who has a good in-between game, as well. Boucher has been great for the Raptors, even though their season has been less than. His improvement from last year is tops for me at the moment.  I agree with all that, but he's still not most improved for me. It feels like a lot of guys have taken bigger jumps; I'd give it to Randle, Bridges, or Wood."
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5. Steph Curry  Honorable mentions: Chris Paul, Lebron James, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, James Harden  **Rookie of the year:**  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Tyrese Haliburton 3. Anthony Edwards  **Sixth man of the year:**   1. Jordan Clarkson 2. Jalen Brunson 3. Joe Ingles  **Most improved player:**  1. Chris Boucher 2. Mikal Bridges 3. Christian Wood  **Coach of the year:**  1. Monty Williams 2. Quin Snyder 3. Mike Malone  If there's any specific questions about a ranking or omission, I can add that in the comments."
"The guy who might be a threat to his throne is [Christian Wood](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2019-20,2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason). 78% at the rim the past 2 yrs. It's not at the same volume but he's also been in bad situations and has only started like 60 games I could see him developing into a guy who gets his rim frequency up to like 12 shots at the rim per 100 poss while keeping relatively similar efficiency in like 2 yrs. But yeah I dont think Giannis's claim as the best finisher in the NBA is really disputed right now."
So why is he having the best stretch of his career under Silas? Rockets have Christian Wood and Kelly is still giving them great minutes
Lmfao Jerami Grant has 33 dunks in 48 games for the Pistons this season alone.   If Blake couldn’t get dunks why could all of his teammates???? Christian Wood had 115 last year. Drummond had 81. Blake had 5 over two seasons.   It’s delusional to honestly think he was trying in Detroit. He gave up. It’s pitiful.
Christian Wood and Kelly Olynyk. Tall splash brothers
Christian Wood went from undrafted and bouncing around to a bunch of different teams to averaging almost 21 ppg this year. He might have won MIP had he not missed a bunch of games. He was damn good with Detroit last year too after Drummond was traded.
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.       Hopefully you don't mind but I decided to post this ranked table for total differential.        |Rank|Team|Player|Total Differential| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|**17.6**| |2|LA Lakers|LeBron James|**15.2**| |3|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid|**14.7**| |4|Utah Jazz|Rudy Gobert|**14.4**| |5|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|**12.2**| |6|LA Clippers|Paul George|**11.0**| |7|LA Clippers|Kawhi Leonard|**10.7**| |8|Minnesota Timberwolves|Karl-Anthony Towns|**10.7**| |9|Brooklyn Nets|Kevin Durant|**9.8**| |10|Denver Nuggets|Nikola Jokic|**9.8**| |11|Miami Heat|Jimmy Butler|**9.5**| |12|LA Lakers|Anthony Davis|**8.4**| |13|Atlanta Hawks|Trae Young|**8.1**| |14|Houston Rockets|Christian Wood|**7.9**| |15|Toronto Raptors|Pascal Siakam|**7.9**| |16|Detroit Pistons|Jerami Grant|**7.8**| |17|Brooklyn Nets|Kyrie Irving|**7.5**| |18|Boston Celtics|Jason Tatum|**7.4**| |19|Miami Heat|Bam Adebayo|**6.6**| |20|New York Knicks|Julius Randle|**6.1**| |21|Dallas Mavericks|Luka Doncic|**6.0**|"
Wiseman and the pick for Christian wood?! Bruh come on warriors never doing that
"Sabonis, probably Nurkic, maybe Christian Wood at this point. There’s an argument do Jarret Allen and maybe JV? So yeah, more like 9-12. Still very good."
But there isn't anyone available in that tier. But if they're not looking for an allstar i guess Christian Wood can be a good piece for them. Wiseman and Minny pick might be enough for Houston.
"Wait did KAT die or something wtf.  Jokic=Embiid&gt;KAT&gt;Gobert&gt;Bam  Jokic and Embiid are head and shoulders above the rest imo, with KAT and his talent and what he has showed us he can do putting him at 3 (minny being trash isnt really all his fault). Then gobert who rose real quick this season and is there purely for his ridiculous defensive presence and a glue guy for the 1 seed jazz. Lastly Bam who is just such a talented player and is so good both offensively and defensively and has proven he can show up big when needed to.  Those are my top 5.  Next tier below are just below Bam and have potential to get in the top 5. These are Vuc, KP, Christian Wood and Timelord.   Vuc on a good team i believe can really shine, the magic just was not it for him to really display his true talents. KP when healthy is something that is completely unstoppable offensively tbh. Hes on the low end of this list but every season he has flashes and games that really show just how dangerous he can be but his health stops him from going any higher. Christian Wood has made leaps and bounds this season and now that he has minutes is showing how talented he is. I think he has the skills to be a top tier center but needs a little more time for growth.  While the top 5 are what i consider completely irreplaceable players for their teams and whose skillset are damn near complete (other than rudy but his defensive prowess compensates for him not being as good as the others on offence), the next tier is the players who i think can make then jump up but need a little more development or experience or that have the potential to be great but dont show it properly due to their circumstances. This is exactly where i think timelord fjts in. Hes not yet a superstar caliber player and is still definitely growing. He is doing well and shows potential but has not proven that he can show up big when needed. You cant really justify a player being top 5 center imo without them being a clear top 2 option and be getting some serious minutes.  Maybe he will take that next jump next year, but for now na no way hes already a top 5 center currently."

"Dude we’re playing 4 rookies, a ten-day contract, a 32 year old, 2 second year guys, and Cory freaking Joseph. We have ONE very good player right now. We also traded away two former MVPs and another All-star, didn’t re-sign Christian Wood, and traded Luke Kennard and Bruce brown. How are we trying to make the playoffs? 😂"

"Tate, Tate, Tate, Tate, Christian Wood"
"Exactly, that should be given to guys who have taken leaps and strides in their game. Jerami Grant from role player to borderline all-star; Christian Wood from barely in the league to top C; Julius Randle from a spinning meme to a walking triple double"
Ewing effect about to take place with DJ Wilson in for Christian Wood.
Christian Wood definitely isn't good enough to be a first option yet...
"Sabonis and Towns were born in the United States. There’s also Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Dwight Howard, and Robert Williams."
"Yeah they were signing guys who had no business being in the NBA like TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Jakarr Sampson, Christian Wood"
they also had Julius Randle and Christian Wood
"otoh the shorter 3 point line, looser goaltending rules, and lack of a defensive 3 seconds rule would have christian wood looking like moses malonakovic. rockets by double digits"
yeah like the kings might actually make the play-in with golden state being injured. the nba team most likely to lose to an euro league team is the rockets without christian wood that offense was rough 🤮
"The Pistons were at the top of the NBA - six straight trips to the ECF, back to back Finals appearance and one quarter away from repeating as champions in 2005 against the Spurs  After that the owner died, his wife took over, Dumars ran the team into the ground, did not rebuild properly, gave away big contracts to terrible players, drafted decently but due to the coaching carousel never developed these players and watched as players like Middleton, Dinwiddie, and others thrived once they left.  Then Davidson's wife sold the team to Tom Gores, a coke addict billionaire who despite much success in other areas of life - can not run a basketball team.  The coaching carousel continued with Ron Jeremy aka Jeff's lil bro aka Stan Van Build a fucking a Wall being hired as a Coach/GM combo. He proceeded to put the keys of the franchise in the hands of one of the best point guards of probably the last thirty years, Reggie Jackson. Then on the eve of being fired, and supposedly at the behest of said coke addict, SVG mortgaged the entire future (or whatever was left of it) in order to get Blake Griffin.  Once Blake Griffin recovered from the shock of his premature jersey retirement and traded to the D, he actually put together a really great string of games. The Pistons had a chance to do right by him and trade him to a team and get big assets, possibly more than what they traded away. But instead they chose to keep him, he got injured (again), and was just bought out.  Now we have hired Weaver, a new GM from Presti's tree in OKC, who so far has been swindled on various trades, drafted big men only to pay Plumlee 8M to start, let Christian Wood walk for nothing (when it was all but confirmed he wanted to stay in Detroit), drafted Killian Hayes (a reach).  On the bright side, we bought out Blake Griffin, the only player besides Sekou (who you really cant call an NBA player maybe G league) left over from last year.  Something to keep in mind, since 1980 the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 only THREE times - 1981 - Isiah Thomas, 1994 - Grant Hill, 2003 - Darko Milicic.  In the past 40 years, the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 - 3 times.  Not bad enough to be in the top of the draft, but not good enough to actually make some noise.  In that 40 year period only 10 franchises won a championship - Celtics, Lakers, Bulls, Sixers, Spurs, Heat, Mavericks, Cavs, Warriors, Raptors.  I know it's a grim outlook but we did have the Bad Boys Pistons two chips and the Going to Work Pistons that forced the league to change the rules and brought home a chip in 2004. And despite the hard times im still proud to be a Pistons fan and will be till the end! GO PISTONS!"
What am I upset about? I have the MVP on my team and a promising future with one of the best starting 5s in the league. Your team's MVP is Christian Wood and your favorite guy said your team is trash and left 😂😂  But sure I'm upset.
"Jakarr is pretty awful, but besides that, these are all real NBA players with a place in the league, plus some all stars (assuming christian wood makes one soo )"
"If you include Embiid, the all-Process Sixers team in 2021 is not terrible     TJ   Covington  Jerami Grant   Dario  Embiid  Christian Wood  Nerlens  Richaun Holmes  Ish Smith  Jakaar  MCW"
And then we waived Christian Wood to sign him and he immediately broke his foot.
"There's definitely a case to be made for any of them.   As for Wiseman, my reasoning is that most athletic rim running bigs with Wiseman's frame and athletic ability typically pan out. I feel pretty comfortable that given the time to develop, he can be a Clint Capela/Christian Wood/Tyson Chandler type, and he already has the beginnings of a decent jumpshot. Those guys typically need years though. At one point Tyson Chandler was considered a quasi-bust, and Christian Wood was out of the league entirely, people weren't patient enough with them."
They should have drafted LaMelo and tried to sign Christian Wood

Wiseman is going the Christian Wood route. Calling it now
I mean it was against a healthy Christian Wood?
"This isn't their normal crew to be fair.  Scal needs to realize he doesn't need to just say players names when doing play by play and Mannix has always been just not interesting. Earlier in the game he said he didn't like Christian Wood because if Detroit let him walk he must suck, lol"
"Celtics' announcer: ""What did I miss about Christian Wood?""  By the sounds of it, every game he's ever played..."
"It’s not any fault of ur teams lol look at Aaron Gordon leaving Orlando or Christian wood leaving the pistons. Sometimes teams have better situations and utility for players, and tbh, I don’t think anyone would argue the wolves are even above average in putting their people in a position to succeed. Wiggins was and to this day, not even close to his potential, that’s his own fault, but he’s decently better with the warriors for real reasons"
"We turned RoCo into Christian Wood and a first round pick. All-in-all, we basically turned an injured Capela into one season of RoCo and C Wood. I’ll take that return everyday.   Hawks got Capela for cheap but we still got a great return."
"if you're trying to rebuild around Kevin Porter and Christian Wood, you're in worse shape that I thought..."
"We got two first round picks for him... That’s a pretty good return if you ask me. We also then flipped one of the picks in the Christian Wood sign and trade, so we basically turned Covington into Christian Wood and a 1st. 10/10 would do again"
We talking about the man who lost his ankles trying to defend Christian Wood on the perimeter a couple weeks back?
"Better centers. Jo Jo, Jokic, Vucivic, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Drummond, Allen, Nurkic, Aldridge, KAT, Ayton, Gobert, Steven Adams, Clint Capella, Christian Wood Ehhh bout the same: Mason Plumlee, Time Lord, Noel, Poetl, Claxton, Kanter."
Offer the minny pick and wiseman for Christian wood and ask for pick swap.  Ik hou wants to keep him but that offer might be too good for them to pass up
They have a bunch of assets. Use some to trade for Christian wood. Rockets get draft picks which they desperately need and pels get a big they can play w Zion. A really good big
"1. They are not the defining measure of a PG, but the offense comes to a halt when Luka isn't on the court. Isn't that the PG's job? 2. They brick alot of shots because they aren't getting easy ones at the rim. 3. His primary position is PG but he is shoot first PG that only passes when the clock is low.. 4. 5. They traded away, Curry, Wright, and released Barea while Brunson was still injured. Does that make any sense?  Dwight was available. Christian Wood was available. Dallas as multitude of Centers that don't rebound particularly well. Dallas failed to address any of the weaknesses the team had in the off season. If they didn't you wouldn't see everyone complaining about Powell, WCS, or KP."

"I mean 7-9 from 3 is 7-9 from 3. That said, playing DeAndre Jordan on Christian Wood probably wasn't doing Brooklyn any favors.  (I actually think DJ is better than his rep this year, but floor spacing 5's are a pretty tough assignment for the old man)"
"Yeah! Christian Wood is another one, brilliant stories. It’s always so nice to see"
"Shit the Rockets could have got Jarrett Allen as well who's a young fringe All Star calibre centre  Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Caris Levert is a pretty decent core. The Rockets really didn't look too bad when Christian Wood was healthy, a handful of pieces away from being in the Western playoff bubble tier which is a much better position than where they're at now imo."
Crap I benched Christian Wood because of injury.  Whatever I should still win.
I mean christian wood missing most of the season has a bit to do with that right? Nice fucking try though
"Depending on how far you wanna go back, I’d go Sixers.   For this exercise, I’m assuming only they get the power of foresight. Just for a quick primer, not getting to deep into late picks and such:  Draft Devin Booker instead of Jahlil Okafor  Draft Tatum at 1, or trade back from 3 with Sacramento for 5 and 10 (was a rumored possibility at the time) and take 2 of Fox/Mitchell/Bam.  And then instead of drafting Zhaire Smith, draft SGA.  Additionally, they’d retain some selection of Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, Covington, Saric, etc. to fill out the team with those new guys, Ben, and Joel."
"&gt; Why isn't this reflected in the advanced stats?   It is, which is why he is lower in RAPTOR.  &gt; You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others   That the biggest part of his value? It's exactly what he brings to the table that Zion doesn't. Zion can't do that despite dominating the ball.   &gt; Defensive catch-all metrics are really poor at judging individual defensive impact, do you actually think that Randle is a top 40 defensive player in the NBA this year? That same metric also has Christian Wood as the 6th best defender in the league, Andre Drummond 16th, all ahead of players Adebayo and Giannis at 50th, and Simmons 53rd   Wait so when you bring up advanced metrics to highlight Zions value that is all good, but the metrics lie when they highlight Randles value. That's pretty convenient.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; This is just silly. There are players in the NBA who's entire job is to catch lobs or do a specific thing on defence. You think Zion, who is a playmaking freak athlete, with elite body control, and finishing who is capable of attacking in a variety of situations over or around a variety of defences is the most one dimensional player in the league   Basically all of the players can play defense, or rebound extremely well, or stretch the floor. Zion can do none of those things.   &gt; He also does so much less efficiently, I also don't believe he is such a better distributor. Zion initiates offence from the other baseline and creates off the dribble from beyond the arc more frequently and I believe with more ability than Randle   You are literally contradicting yourself here. Like you said Randle runs the offense, Zion absolutely doesn't, Zion receives the ball and then attacks, that is basically all he does. Which is why Randle has almost twice as many assists as Zion.   &gt; But it seems like the Knicks don't actually win many games because of the offence that he primarily runs   They win more games than the Pelicans so by that logic is worse.      &gt; This is also why 538 thinks that the Pelicans will actually win 1 more game than the Knicks by the end of the season. But yeah, Randle is a winner while Zion isn't because one of them has a handful more wins than the other   Hypotheticals, hypotheticals, hypotheticals.      Randle isn't the winner because the Knicks won a handful more games. He is the winner because he is the more complete player who has taken a much worse team to a better record, while playing better in every area besides scoring. Pelicans is stock full of talent. Their entire starting lineup is full of young stars or capable NBA players like Adams, and yet they lose. The second best player on the knicks is an inefficient sophomore guard, the third best player is who? Some rookie? Reggie Bullock?"
"&gt;Zion doesn't ALSO do anything. He scores 3 more points, that is it. He is worse at every other thing than Randle.  Why isn't this reflected in the advanced stats?  &gt;To score. He plays like a 1984 big man, he can't shoot. He literally attempts 0,1 attempts from outside 9 feet, which is only a viable strategy because they have a ton of talented offensive players, who can pick up the slack and stretch the floor, Randle isn't so lucky.  You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others  The Pelicans are 23rd in the league in 3pr, they aren't shooting them at a high rate. The offensive talent around him is better than Randle's, but is it 18 spots better on offence better?   Zion also plays with a traditional big, but like you said manages to score the vast majority of his baskets at the rim. It's not like he catches them all there, Zion attacks downhill and he attacks in transition in a way that other teams aren't really able to stop  &gt;Randle is the highest defensively ranked Knick  No one actually thinks that Randle is the best defensive Knick  &gt;is ranked as the 40 best defensive player in the NBA according to RAPTOR  Defensive catch-all metrics are really poor at judging individual defensive impact, do you actually think that Randle is a top 40 defensive player in the NBA this year? That same metric also has Christian Wood as the 6th best defender in the league, Andre Drummond 16th, all ahead of players Adebayo and Giannis at 50th, and Simmons 53rd  &gt;And if offense was somehow all that mattered that would be a good argument  You just said that Zion doesn't play winning basketball, but Randle doesn't. Is your argument now that the reason Randle plays winning basketball but Zion doesn't because of their defence? So Zion plays winning basketball on offence, but then because of his defence his basketball is no longer winning?  &gt;He is the most one dimensional player in the league.   This is just silly. There are players in the NBA who's entire job is to catch lobs or do a specific thing on defence. You think Zion, who is a playmaking freak athlete, with elite body control, and finishing who is capable of attacking in a variety of situations over or around a variety of defences is the most one dimensional player in the league  &gt;Randle is a better defender, rebounder, distributor and scores 3 fewer points while playing with worse offensive talent and winning more games  He also does so much less efficiently, I also don't believe he is such a better distributor. Zion initiates offence from the other baseline and creates off the dribble from beyond the arc more frequently and I believe with more ability than Randle  Nevertheless, if Randle is so much better in all of these areas, why doesn't it show up in the advanced stats?  As you said   &gt;Randle Is the primary offensive player on a team that actually wins games  But it seems like the Knicks don't actually win many games because of the offence that he primarily runs  -  There's also the fact that the Knicks probably aren't any better than the Pelicans?  The Knicks are currently 1 game over .500, the Pelicans are 4 games under. But the Knicks for the season actually have a negative point differential while the Pelicans have a positive one. This is while the Pelicans play a much tougher schedule than the Knicks which is reflected in Bball references SRS which takes into account schedule and gives the Pel's a 1.1 and the Knicks a -0.3.  This is also why 538 thinks that the Pelicans will actually win 1 more game than the Knicks by the end of the season. But yeah, Randle is a winner while Zion isn't because one of them has a handful more wins than the other"
We have Isaaca and Fultz.  Outside of SGA and  Christian Wood I’d take those 2 over anybody those teams have.  Also Dort but Isaac&gt;Dort.  Also the Pistons?  Seriously.  Grant is great but come on.  We also have better coaching then those teams except maybe OKC.
Kevin Porter Jr and Christian Wood are bright spots. Wall taking 30 shots a game is just jokes at this point.
Christian wood literally had the same stats before he came to us per 36. Casey gets credited for his development but in reality we were just the first place he got minutes
"Bill is right. Ben Simmons, Eric Gordon &amp; Christian wood is definitely a playoff team."
"But Christian Wood and Beef Stu also have *some* guard-like skills, so maybe that factors into it. Or I could be completely wrong idk."
"Any team in the league except Fertita's team would jump at the chance the pay Jarrett Allen. Christian Wood and Jarret Allen are not mutually exclusive. They would fit pretty well together. Jarrett covers up Christian's mediocre-to-bad defense, and Christian stretches the floor as a big."
"Counterpoint, Isaiah Stewart is progressing amazingly and Christian Wood broke out last season."
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
"Simmons &amp; Christian Wood is a great young core you can build around. Throw in Tate and KPJ and you're looking golden with a few 1st round picks, and wall's contract coming off the books for a potential big FA signing with all those players hitting their hypothetical primes.  Honestly, we'd be EXTREMELY LUCKY if the 4 picks from the Nets get us anyting CLOSE to Simmons and Thybulle."
"Dude y'all got hoed. Draft picks are super overrated. I mean come on, so many players end being busts/mediocre players. It's very rare to find anyone close to Ben Simmons or harden. Look at fucking NYK and Minny. Those teams have been shit for years and have had a lot top picks and so many flamed out. NYK is only finally getting good and minny is still shit. You always want to get established players in the league NOW. Also Ben simmons and Christian wood would be a fun combo to watch imo."
"If a young star on their first extension requests a trade, the Thunder have more capital than just about anyone to bid for that player. PURELY hypothetical (please don't take this the wrong way Wolves/Rockets/Pels fans), but let's say a KAT, or Christian Wood, or Brandon Ingram caliber player requests a trade this offseason. The Thunder could put together a trade package probably better than anyone else in the league to go grab one of those guys.   Not a knock on Lauri, but I think the Thunder would set their sights a little higher than a player of his level."
Generally you get assets when you know you can’t retain a player. What don’t you understand that we can’t/weren’t gonna pay him $100 million this off-season? And Christian Wood is already better than Allen lol.
"Not really though, it’s likely that contenders would’ve been more desperate to add that extra star (Oladipo, proven All-Star resume) to make real waves come playoffs. Also paying Allen and Levert through the same tenure as Christian Wood. Wood is and will be our only constant until he retires or decides to leave. Allen interferes with Wood’s development (it’s crazy he’s going to get even better), and we didn’t want that.   Allen and Levert definitely have potential and some teams want that, but contenders will always be more desperate for proven higher caliber players. Oladipo would’ve gotten more assets, had he played extremely well for us. High risk but for a possible high reward."
"Who exactly does your young core consist of other than Christian Wood?   And don’t say Kenyon Martin Jr or Tate, there is at least 10 young cores better than that in the NBA. If anything you have one of the worst ones"
"Wall makes about $42M, Simmons about $35M. Christian Wood makes $13M. Thybulle makes $2.7M. The salary floor is $98M. If they really wanted to spend as little on salary as possible, they could’ve done the Philly trade and gotten damn close."
"It's Christian Wood, washed up John Wall, a guy that sounds like if a 5 year old tried to spell Jayson Tatum (he's actually pretty good tbf) and a bunch of G-Leaguers  Not counting KPJ in there obviously since he wasn't there when Harden was in Houston"
"Christian Wood is really good, but u right"
"&gt; I mean he also is now playing as a bench player instead of a bigger role.  The thing is though, very few people were saying ""you know I think he's still an impactful player he's just not in the right role.""  People were calling him washed and basically done. That doesn't change when a role changes.  A washed player is washed whether or not he's the first or fifth option.   Look at Boogie as a prime example.  He was washed when he was starting with Christian Wood out and he's still washed not on an NBA team right now.  Calling somebody washed is **way** different than saying they would benefit from a lesser role on a team and a lot of people (not necessarily you) are doing that.  &gt; Like he has dunked twice in 2 games after never dunking in a year and a half  We really need to move past the dunking narrative.  It was really dumb when it was first brought up and nothing has changed since then."
"Quick, someone post the Christian Wood COVID one"
"Usually players who are young and with high potential. To mind Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Lamelo Ball, John Collins, Ja Morant, Murray, Mitchell, MPJ. B- tier players that could probably go to A - tier. BI Murray and Mitchell are already all-stars."
christian wood
"I'm speaking for myself here, but that ""prove me wrong"" talk sounds inappropriate when it comes from such a respected figure like Shaq, a legend and a prominent figure in the media. I think it's okay to cast doubts, but he's questioned players' contracts which looks really bad coming from a former player.    I also just don't see the value in tearing down other people, especially stars. I get he's a pundit, and this is his job, but his approach seems a lot more heavy-handed than his peers'. That interview with Christian Wood was pretty awkward and weird by my standards. Overall, I think it's mostly people like me overreacting. The players seem to not give a shit, and I like that."
"I feel like Fox, Shai or Demar should have been in the game prover Mike Conley and they only put him in there bc he has never been. and I said Kings PLAYERS get no love the team doesn't deserve love but Buddy, Fox and Haliburton definitely deserve their credit, bc if you think players don't deserve credit for doing really good but having a bad team Bradley Beal, Christian Wood, KAT, Lavine, Brandon Ingram and Zion should get no love either."
Because he gets assisted on most of his shots and he isn't as good at self creation as most stars. This is like saying the Rockets should give Christian Wood more shots
Rockets have Christian Wood and DJ Augustin!
"The Rockets have Christian Wood, Avery Bradley, and DJ Augustin. And the Pistons have a bunch of future former Pistons. That's why I have those two as my true sleeper picks."
"&gt;I mean, shit, if a 20 game losing streak is doing better without Harden then your standards are ridiculously low  Yup I totally said ""they've been better without him because they went on a 20 game losing streak."" Not that they have a better winning percentage since he left.  Wild that despite this 20 game losing streak (which btw, 18 of these losses came in games Christian Wood missed), they still had a better winning percentage than when MVP Harden was there 😂🤡🤡🤡"
So what you're saying is that Houston has a better winning percentage (.297) since Harden left (despite Christian Wood missing most of those games) than they had with Harden (.250). Wow good point you really got me.
"You're giving this more thought than I am.    OP asked a question that I believe he answered in the negative with the first sentence in his question.      I replied parroting his own rebuttal.       I stand by it.   I don't think Zion should be all-NBA.    Who knows what the league will do.     A still-developing half-way player on a bad team.    I don't think Christian Wood should be all-NBA either,  but he's been exciting when he's played."
They did develop a lot of their players to be NBA players though. They just didn’t have the superstar to build around.   TJ McConnell  Jakar Sampson   Richaun Holmes   TImothy Lu Cabborot   Robert Covington  Jerami Grant   Christian Wood   And those are just the late Undrafted players lol
"The process was 3 years and the worst of those years gave opportunities to a lot of guys who wouldn’t have made it otherwise. That 10 win team featured TJ McConnell, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Jakarr Sampson, Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes who have all signed second contracts and established themselves in this league"
Uhhhhhhhh no. Christian Wood is our best acquisition until further notice
Dude Christian Wood isn’t making the Wolves a playoff team.
KAT  Anthony Edwards  John Wall  Christian Wood  Kelly Olynyk   I could see them winning a game
Losing by 26 at half to the Rockets without Christian Wood is only something the Wolves can do
Christian wood is now out
"The Warriors picked number two last year after winning a championship two years ago. Unprotected first round picks have enormous potential value, especially from a team that has a limited shelf life and virtually no young guys to carry them into the future.  It’s gonna take 4-5 years to know if the trade will be any good and you can’t properly evaluate it right now without knowing how the 2022-2027 Nets looks. What were the Rockets gonna do with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Christian Wood, and a buncha nothing? They’d take a step back from where they were still."
Who do we not photoshop? You could probably find a Christian Wood or KPJ if you look around long enough lol
"Second flop from Dray defensively, Christian Wood cut him up too. However, he was coming off a vaccine dose which held him out of the prior game."
Is Christian Wood the Rockets' Steph Curry? People are asking
Houston when Christian Wood played: 6 game win streak  Houston when Christian Wood got injured: 17 game losing streak
Christian Wood is the same. Right at 500 with him 0-17 since he goes down.
Christian Wood
"Not a Spurs fan obviously, but I think it's a solid framework for a team. I don't think they have anyone who's going to be a consistent All-NBA player or anything like that, but they've got some good pieces throughout their roster that a top level player (especially a top level wing) would turn into a legitimately threatening team.   Of course, that's way easier said than done. It's remarkably unlikely that they'll be able to sign someone to be that piece given that it's San Antonio (Jimmy Butler honestly probably was their best shot there, but even then, that clearly wasn't a likely scenario at all), you can't count on drafting someone like that when you're a fringe playoff team, and I don't see how they could trade for someone like that while retaining the pieces that would make it all work.   Like you said, it's hard getting to the point of being a genuinely good team that's a legit championship threat. There's just not that many guys that are actually capable of being the best player on a contending team, and getting any of those players takes immense luck and (generally) an equally large investment, particularly when you're a small market team. I honestly don't know where I'd say they should go from here when working within the timeframe of Pop's likely remaining years. I don't think they have the assets to move up for a top draft pick, which then leads me to looking at the top players on underperforming teams that maybe could make that next step under a top level coach like Pop. Even then, though, that's a pretty barren list filled with a ton of maybes and ifs, and you basically are locked in once you make those moves given the limits of their draft capital. The best players that I think they could realistically get considering team circumstances would be players like Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, and others like them. Really good players for sure, but do I think any of them (or even all of them) would be enough to put the Spurs into a contending window? Not really, no."
"Rockets could have had Jarrett Allen as well. A Ben Simmons, Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen core is pretty damn solid to build around."
Didn’t they have harden for like the first 15 in some capacity and Christian wood over performing? I think this is relevant because they can easily repeat this next season
"You think the Rockets will offer Christian Wood, though?"
"That depends what you think they can get for him. It’s a no brainer for me based on what I personally think they can realistically get. If the Rockets offer Christian Wood for Wiseman and the Minny pick I’d do that no question, wouldn’t even need to see what Wiseman looks like next year because I know he isn’t giving you anywhere close to a super efficient 21 ppg with nearly 10 boards."
"I mean he was quite literally one of the worst players in the league this season. His best case scenario for next season is most likely okay bench player, and even that isn’t guaranteed. Compare that to a player like Christian Wood who they may be able to get with Wiseman + the Minny pick and it isn’t even a comparison. If you keep him and you’re wrong about him his value depreciates even further *and* you waste yet another year of Steph’s prime not competing. If their goal is to actually win another championship they can’t really wait to see if he pans out. At the most they can wait until the trade deadline, after that they’re just fucking up."
[HOU] Christian Wood pls
"I mean, p sure he's payed millions of dollars to know basketball, but he didn't seem to know Siakam's first name, told Christian Wood he didn't watch him to his face. He comes across as rude to players and also doesn't seem to watch the games closely..."
"Also, Westbrook and Capella wasn’t going to work together.  That’s two nonshooters that can allow defenders to double Harden.  Also, we got Roco and traded Roco later for Christian Wood.  I think we came out okay with the Capella trade."
"One trade I had thought of was Wiseman + Minny pick for Christian Wood. Works salary wise, dude is making pennies compared to what he’s worth. He can’t be a worse defender than Wiseman and he’s twice the scorer he is, which helps considering the Warriors are elite defensively but middle of the pack offensively.  Steph-Klay (assuming full health)-Wiggins-Draymond-Wood is a contending starting 5 imo. Not favourites but definitely contenders."
Christian Wood looks like Kingsley Coman.
"Centers that are definitely better than Ayton right now:   - Embiid  - Jokic  - KAT  - Gobert  - Bam   - AD   - Vucevic   - Capela   - Sabonis     Centers that are arguably as good when healthy:   - Christian Wood   - Jusuf Nurkic   - Kristaps Porzingis   - Jonas Valančiūnas      So at best Ayton is what, the 10th best center in the NBA? It's definitely debatable if he's top 10 or not. I'd say probably 10th or 11th."
Sabonis is a Center just because he starts next to another doesn’t mean he s not.  Most of his minutes for his career is spent at center and he splits time at the five the past 2 years.  Obviously Christian Wood is a center and Porzingis I’ll give you.  He has been trash this year but last year he was really good so I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt he doesn’t deserve and the others were maybe.  But also Poetl is one of the best rim protectors in the league.
"&gt; Christian Wood  my bad, I didn't know he was playing center this year  &gt; Porzingis  Plays zero defense (most important thing for a center!), offence consists purely of chucking bad shots, always hurt. Maybe he'll stay healthy and return to all-star form the more time passes since his injury, but I'm taking Ayton over him this year.  &gt; Sabonis  he's a power forward  &gt; Turner  not gonna lie, I haven't watched enough Pacers games to have an opinion  &gt; Capela  ok, sure  &gt; Ibaka  Hell no, and I say this as someone who owns an Ibaka jersey. He has become quite overrated.  &gt; Poetl  Andris Biedrins 2.0  &gt; Nerlens Noel  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Ui-R1NGow  &gt; Brook Lopez  Hmm. Ayton is a much more switchable defender. Brook is kinda slow. Although Brook's ability to space the floor makes him better offensively. It's up in the air between these two imo."
"Christian Wood, Porzingis, Sabonis, Turner,  Capella, Ibaka(maybe), Poetl(maybe), Nerlens Noel(maybe), Brook Lopez(maybe)  So at best he's the 12th best center.  At worst he's the 16th."
...why lol?  They have two rookies that look like they can be good players.  Christian Wood showed his Detroit year wasn't a fluke.  They got KPJ for nothing and then he dropped 50-10. And if he feels good about Silas he feels good about Silas.  Definitely didn't go terribly
Christian Wood lowkey with the best take on shaq in decades
Christian Wood checked him earlier this year.
"""Casual."" - Christian Wood"
"I think it’s absurd to be making Embiid comps for Wiseman after the season he just had.  Hell even Ayton wasn’t getting comps to an MVP level players and Ayton in his rookie year was far and away better than Wiseman’s rookie year.  Going off the season Wiseman just had, I think Christian Wood is a realistic ceiling. Don’t even begin to compare him to an MVP level talent lol. Only rookie from this class that deserves comparison to MVP level talent is Melo."
Real ones blame Christian Wood
"Dude, centers don’t just develop defence overnight, especially if they’re already lost defensively. His offence is better than his D. It’s gonna be a long developmental process to get him to be an average defender, let alone a shot blocking defensive center. He has a *lot* to work on in that end.  He looks, to me, like he could be Christian Wood on offence and Hassan Whiteside on defence in his prime. Which is fine, that’s a good player, but it’ll take years and years to get him to that level.  Why not just trade for a defensive center? Those are easy to find. Im sure Myles Turner would only cost like, Kelly Oubre &amp; a pick"
"They were 11-10. Then Christian Wood got hurt. Says a lot about how good he is. Him, Porter Jr and whoever they draft will be a hell of a trio"
Christian Wood died for this
Would you trade Christian Wood for our James Wiseman?
"I think folks are beginning to see the light with Andre Drummond but generally speaking, yes, he's been an overrated rebounder for much of his career, particularly over the past few years.  For one, rebounding totals are inflated for certain players these days in comparison to previous generations. The paint is emptier than it's ever been and the few bigs still hanging around inside can generally have their pick of defensive boards with little competition. For better or worse, you're not really running into Patrick Ewing-Charles Oakley-Charles Smith front lines these days where all three are chilling in the paint bodying dudes up all night and divvying up rebounds along the way.  Drummond's also not a big ball pursuit type of guy. The defensive boards he cleared in Detroit were generally in the vicinity of the paint and often uncontested (as alluded above). If he didn't grab them, Marcus Morris or Aron Baynes or Christian Wood seemingly would have just as well in many cases.   Drummond's inflated offensive boards situation is well documented by now. He *does* miss a lot of gimmies that he then tips back in (at which point he'll sometimes miss again). However, I also think this is where he's been the biggest asset. There was a time when the Pistons had a semblance of an offense (healthy Reggie Jackson era) and they hummed best when Detroit could push tempo knowing Andre would be running the floor to convert a back-breaking tip-in off a teammate's miss in transition. *That's* why he was named an all-star in 2016; he was mostly staying in his lane and filling in his team's gaps.   By and large though, having lived through the Dennis Rodman Pistons era and the Ben Wallace Pistons era, Drummond's true rebounding instincts and skills cannot hold a candle to either of those two."
The thing is giving up assets to extend him for 17M/year was an awful deal. You could've signed Jakob Poeltl for like 13M/year outright and he's better than Adams or gone after Christian Wood.
Rockets/Hawks  Height boost: Trae and Jae Sean tate    Skill boost: Cam reddish and Kenyon Martin jr   Athleticism boost: Trae or Gallo and Christian Wood
Christian Wood also
"To maybe find a middle ground, I liked the Adams trade, but I didn't like the extension. When Favors left, we were left with absolutely no startable big men. Christian Wood had been released the year prior and gone to Detroit, and showed real promise there. Jahlil Okafor would have 24 good seconds in a game before his athleticism just made him a liability. He had some good games, but they were few and far between. Finally, Hayes was too young and inexperienced, he wasn't even supposed to play NBA minutes in his rookie year when the Pelicans drafted him.  All this to say that they needed a big man, and unless they wanted to pay for someone like Aaron Baynes, dumping those picks and guys they weren't resigning or had previously planned to release like Frank Jackson and Kenrich Williams seems like a fair tradeoff to me. But like you've said, the extension was not good when compared to market value, and the fact that you can find a low cost center in free agency in the off-season, or a better trade candidate.  Some people argue that he was also an extension target because of his attitude he brings to the team. I think that's pretty crappy speculation, we have no reason to believe that's anything more than wishful thinking for a fanbase."
"This is totally ignoring the broader context. If you really want to blame it on one individual (which is silly), blame it on Christian Wood.   Christian Wood is likely the first player who contracted COVID. He was playing with COVID symptoms for several games, and is almost certainly who Gobert got it from. Gobert just happened to have his positive test come in first (Wood’s came in right after).   Several other players from other teams had positive results rolling in shortly after playing against Wood as well."
First to test positive. Christian Wood literally played while having COVID symptoms before testing positive and no one cares
Ok so I’m not the only one. When we played Houston I thought he was Christian Wood at least 5 times.
I watched this highlight 3 times and only realised it wasn't Christian Wood dunking after reading this comment
Rockets young core is really good.  Kevin Porter Jr-20 years  Kenyon Martin-20 Years  Christian Wood- 25 years.  Plus they could get Cade Cunningham and have alot picks like OKC.
"Funnily enough between Nerlens, RoCo, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes and Christian Wood we actually had some decent NBA talent (now, at least) on the 10-72 roster"
Christian Wood is not a mediocre center. He's a very good player.
"How many do.  Detroit has Stewart who has proven to be an intriguing prospect and certainly flashes potential as a starting caliber big.  OKC has Moses Brown and his rebounding is a huge weapon.  We have WCJ with his versatile defense and rim running.  Houston has Christian a wood.  Minny has Towns.  Cleveland has Jarrett Allen in restricted free agency.  Every lottery team has a center prospect that they want to either develop or has proven to be capable of playing 25 minutes a night as a starter.  Most teams downsize anyway so it’s not like they need a big man for 35 minutes as their first,second or third option.  I’d rather pay all of those guys 10 million a year going forward than eventually having to give Evan Mobley his rookie extension if he isn’t going to be able to be the best player on a championship team.  If he can be that guy than frankly he should be the clear cut number one pick because Superstar big men are extremely valuable but starting centers or lower tier all star centers are frankly found everywhere in the league.  A team can sign Richaun Holmes and probably get a decent starting center who can switch and run the pick and roll.  Star guards and wings are steal way more valuable for championship teams these days."
"You’re so clueless lmao  You might not like the Harden trade, but LeVert, even if he had a good game, is still a really inneficient scorer his whole career.  Hes also 26, so hes not going to be part of our future, but with his shot profile would take oportunities away from young guys  We took Oladipo because we thought he was the better player, and he left us flexible to start tanking next season when we own out picks. In hindsight it looks bad but back then it really didnt. When we took Oladipo they were about the same efficiency but Oladipo was a much better defender.  At the end of the day we got Olynyk, who might leave in the offseason but for this year has been a lot better than LeVert has been, at least for us, and has been an excelent veteran and is really good friends with KPJ  Now saying the FO is incompetent when they nailed the 52nd pick in KJ Martin, got Tate as an UDFA and hes a top 5 rookie, got Christian Wood for 13M a year and got Kevin Porter Jr for free is actually mind blowing lol"
"Money and redundancy, given they just signed Christian Wood."
"&gt; Obviously he ended up being right so kudos to him, but Jokic is really the exception not the rule when it comes to good advanced stats on low volume players.  People say this every year, and it's just not true. This happens all the time. [Back in 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071122115204/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/), you had articles talking about this phenomenon, finding that players forced into more minutes actually *improved* with the larger role. They called it the Paul Millsap doctrine, based on his stellar per-minute play as Carlos Boozer's backup holding up excellently when Boozer got injured and he became a starter.  There's been tons of examples of it ever since.  * James Harden put up great per-minute scoring numbers on an insane .660 TS% in his last year in OKC (back in 11-12, that TS% was even more impressive than it is now), and then people were shocked that he continued to be an amazing scorer when he went to Houston. * Clint Capela averaged 13 and 8 on 64% shooting in 24 mpg in 16-17; a couple years later, he averaged 17 and 13 on 65% shooting in 33 mpg. His per-minute and per-possession stats were basically unchanged; he just was on the floor for more time per game. * Christian Wood came off the bench for his first 50 games last season; he averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds per 36 on 66% TS, in an 18 mpg role. He became a starter for the last 12 games when Drummond was shut down; he put up 23 points and 10 rebounds per 36 on 65% TS in the larger role, playing 35 mpg. This year, as a full-time starter in Houston, he's again averaging 23 and 11 per 36.  I could go on for a while. There are going to be some failure modes here; you can't extrapolate a tiny sample, and if someone plays only 5 mpg in garbage time that's not the same as even a 24 mpg role. Maybe you adjust a guy's performance down a couple percentage points for fatigue, though you could also adjust it up due to finding more of a rhythm in the game.  And Jokic showed his greatness early too. As a rookie, he was averaging 10-7-2 in 22 minutes on .580 TS%. There was nothing at all ridiculous about saying he was better than Porzingis (14-7-1 in 28 minutes on .518 TS%). Per possession, Jokic did almost everything better, which explains why all advanced stats had him significantly better. By year 2, he was averaging 17-10-5 on 64 TS% in 28 mpg; per-possession, that's a slightly better version of what he did for the next four years, earning himself all-NBA teams."
"I’m in the championship too but I have goddamn Lebron and jaylen brown and Brandon Ingram and Christian wood and all those fuckers missing games. Anderson had a baller game last night tho, dude consistently fills up the stat sheet, can make you some 3s, score double digits, get you assists, get 5+ rebounds, get you a steal and close to a blk, he’s really a super underrated fantasy player because he helps you in so many categories and that’s valuable."
Why you lying? They went 8-4 immediately after he left then Christian Wood got hurt and they decided to tank the season.
"They have a ton of draft picks, Kevin Porter JR, and Christian Wood.   But yeah, they’re gonna be out of the playoffs for a while."
Most recently DJ wilson. Sterling brown was that dude for a while... Christian Wood... Johnny o bryant... Tobias harris
"I’m pretty sure Christian Wood was in the g league too, I think the gap is more in terms of style and situation than talent"
That's not really a deal breaker. Celtics managed to trade for kyrie and sign kemba after using up IT4. Clippers managed to sign Kawhi and trade for PG.  At most you might get a few free agents that would otherwise sign with rockets for same money but decide not to because of fertita ... except you literally didn't with Christian wood.
"Why can't he take credit for KPJ? He's improved from last year, particularly as a playmaker. Sterling Brown is having a career year. Jae'sean Tate and Kenyon Martin have shown promise. Christian Wood has made the leap to full time starter. Only player that has flopped is Daniel House."
"The game before the shut down we played the Pistons, and he went against Christian Wood. [Wood reportedly played with flu symptoms](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/03/16/report-since-diagnosed-with-coronavirus-christian-wood-played-76ers-with-flu-like-symptoms/) the very same day Gobert tested positive. It's possible he got it from Wood. It's also possible Gobert got it from Donovan Mitchell, as a week before the shutdown the Jazz played the Knicks and Donovan who is from Westchester County NY and spent time with friends and family. Westchester County was one of the first COVID hotspots.  I'm not trying to play ""find patient zero"" but just feel bad for how much hate Rudy got for being the first one tested. I get he brought some of the hate on himself, but dude will forever be known as the guy who gave the NBA Covid."
"Fuck it let's try this...   PG: Fred VanVleet  SG: Khris Middleton  SF: Bojan Bogdanović  PF: Christian Wood  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: Seth Curry, Chris Boucher, Gary Trent Jr, Lu Dort, Yam Madar just for the hell of it."
"He wasn’t patient zero though, Christian Wood was, who was playing with COVID symptoms for several games, and is almost certainly who Gobert got it from.   Several other players from other teams had positive results rolling in shortly after playing against Wood."
"I’d rather have Christian Wood at this point. If Kristaps can find the defense he used to play in NY again, then we can make it a discussion.  But as of right now, they are both one-way players, and Wood just plays better on that end."
According to BBREF he logs 100% of his minutes at center and 1% at power forward  [Christian Wood Position Estimate](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/woodch01.html#pbp)
"Jakob Poeltl, Christian Wood, Bouchier all signed for less than adams did last off-season. They just overpaid him, decent centers can be had for cheap."
The problem I see with the Wolves and this trade is “win-now”. I think they need significantly more than Christian Wood to win in the west.

"I mean most of the players who were traded off or waived were done so after Hinkie was booted.  The 15-16 team had Jerami Grant, Covington, TJ McConnel, Noel, Okafor, JaKarr Sampson, Christian Wood, etc."
"Heir is a difference between developing young players to be better and putting them in a position to fail so that your pick is maximized.  Moses Brown has proven to be an awesome player  and unless he got hurt in the Pacers game, there was no reason for him to only play 18 minutes.  It’s already a blow out so have him run for 30.  The extra twelve ain’t hurting him.  Dort has improved tremendously yet he got a dnp for an injury that no one is aware of.  Nobody thinks Kenrich Williams is a great difference maker yet he’s clearly the best wing available and yet he doesn’t get over thirty minutes.  That’s hella sketchy.  Same with Ty Jerome.  He’s the best guard you have with SGA out.  He’s nothing special but isn’t it a slap in the face of a player like him trying to make it in the league and get paid to give him a coaches DNP because he’s slightly better than who you have on the court.  Detroit resting dudes is silly but they at least throw out all of their young guys for extended minutes even the good ones like Isiah Stewart who might screw up the tank.  Houston is giving Kevin Porter and Christian Wood all they can eat while they are healthy and if they lose they lose but at least they want to see what two cornerstones can do when healthy so they know who can be put around them.  We have no choice but to play our vets because we are so injured we just gotta play whoever is healthy to field an actually team.  We don’t have DNP luxuries.  I’d wish OkC fans can see why certain other fans find their non transparent tanking methods to be awful for the league."
"Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes too. It’s more than 4-5…"
"TJ McConnell, Christian Wood and Jerami Grant too"
What good players? Lol that roster is trash. Wall and Oladipo are washed. KPJ wasn’t even with them at the time I don’t believe. Christian Wood supposed to come in and save the day? Lol
Christian Wood is a great off ball and on ball defender making less than Miles.
"Steph getting ripped by Christian Wood, exactly the kind of game it's been"
"yeah i don’t get it either. unless steph specifically said he wants screens, why not let him iso christian wood?? i’m sure he could at least make some space for himself..."
"He is still 21, could turn it into like a long career if he gets more efficient.  Christian Wood was garbage until like two years ago, Julius Randle was not stater quality for a while. Kevin Knox won't be those two, but dramatic improvement at age like 24 or 25 is still possible if he works at it"
"It's a great idea to bring up, but your criteria are too loose.  &gt; Average defender: this one is tougher to define because defense stats can be often misleading, so I'm gonna go by eye test and my general opinion while trying to be as unbiased as possible  Don't ever go by ""eye test"".  Just use Defensive RAPTOR from 538.  For my list I'll only include players with at least +1.0 rating (top 100 defensive players this year) with 500 minutes or more.  &gt; Above Average 3pt shooter: the player must be above ~35% 3pt% for the 2021 season, and attempt at least 3 3s a game on average  At least three 3s a game is good, but 35% is too low.  We're not looking for average shooters, we want good ones.  I'll use 37%.  These guys fit that criteria this year (in order of Def RAPTOR rating):  1. embiid 1. batum 1. crowder 1. christian wood 1. Gay 1. covington 1. melton 1. anunoby 1. p George 1. connaughton 1. muscala 1. randle 1. kleber 1. Green 1. jrue holiday 1. Leonard 1. royce o'neale 1. Finney-Smith 1. Korkmaz 1. Niang 1. Mikal Bridges  Considering that 5 of these players are making over $20 mil a year, it's hard to classify them as 3 and D players people would be talking of filling their roster to complete it, but theres still good names there.  Randle is the only questionable one on the list because this is the first year hes been good defensively and/or had a decent 3pt%.  But if he can turn around one, why not the other?  Christian wood is also someone people might scoff at, but this is his 2nd year in a row of a good defensive RAPTOR season and makes him 2 for 2 when he gets non-garbage minutes.  Additionally, here's a list of players who just missed the 3pt requirements (either in % or attempts):  1. campazzo (36.9%) 1. cam johnson (36%) 1. neto (2.6 attempts) 1. bazemore (2.5 attempts) 1. vanvleet (36.7%)  You're obviously still right there aren't many, but considering most people are thinking of a swingman (SG, SF, PF) for a 3nD player, it looks more like around 15 players (including those from the ""almosts"") aren't making tons of money and could be considered a swingman.  And the list would only get smaller if we limit to players with consistently good defensive seasons or 3pt numbers."
"Against a front line of Kelly Olynyk and Christian Wood.   Neither, are very noticeable defenders whenever I watch them."
That's not very surprising considering MPJ was the #1 prospect out of HS before his back injuries. Christian Wood was barely on anyone's radar until last season. But yea I can see MPJ having an outside shot at it next year since Jamal will be out for most of the season.
Hell be an all star before christian wood
Hopefully Christian Wood doesn’t leave before they get good.
Imo it’s incredibly hard to judge his first season because if you go back to his first few interviews he was talking about how he designed plays specifically for russ and harden... Then after both those players got traded we gained some momentum and were sitting around 7th in the west and then Christian wood went down and we went on the 20 game losing streak. Along with both harden and Russ leaving the rockets are top 5 in games lost due to injury and this doesn’t even include covid protocols. Silas has definitely shown promise but also a lot of rookie mistakes definitely excited to see what next season holds when this group has an offszn under their belt and training camp
Didn’t hold true for Christian Wood
"Ehhhh, hold your horses there. There was tons of picks and switching going on in that game. Like if you watched the first half you’d know Jrue Holiday was mostly on Christian Wood and in the 2nd half KPJ had lots of switches on him."
"John Wall, KPJ, Jae'Sean Tate, Kelly Olynyk, Christian Wood  *Could become* a good starting 5."
Not sure if KPJ and Christian Wood or Kobe and Shaq.
God it feels good to have KPJ and Christian wood on my fantasy team.
Yeah this play reall just showed me that Christian Wood definitely knows how to abuse mismatches
Too bad the bucks couldn’t keep Christian Wood.

I can't even begin to figure out what this stat is basing these ranks on. Conley is top 10 and Jamal Murray is right behind him. Christian wood is above Embiid. I can't find a rhyme or reason
Christian Wood and DJ Wilson are about to destroy us.
Every good player thinks they deserve a max. Like are Christian wood and Collin sexton really worth maxes?
Locking up Christian Wood on a steal contract is pretty dope too
Christian Wood
Christian wood is 25
Trade the 3rd overall pick for Christian Wood
"Ya I haven’t watched him enough that’s fair. I did watch a little bit of the game last night and happened to watch Christian wood score at will against KAT in the limited mins I watched. Both are good young players still developing I think I just value Bam’s defense, athleticism, effort, and finishing more than KAT’s shooting ability. You’re right team fit is extremely important, I’m just comparing 1 to 1 right now and I’m biased from Bams play in the bubble last year which really impressed me."

JJJ and Christian wood intrigue me. Not saying we could get them.
"Exactly. If you are tanking you might as well start random young g-league/undrafted talent and see what happens. Sometimes they are complete trash and sometimes you find gems like Robert Covington, Lu Dort, Moses Brown, Christian Wood etc."
Robert Covington. TJ McConnell. Nerlens Noel. Dario Saric. Jarami Grant. Michael Carter Williams. Christian Wood.
Christian wood isn’t worth a top 5 pick flat out
Fantasy bball: If you could play one tonight and one later in the week who you going with tonight...Olynyk or Christian Wood?
Christian Wood. I remember Rockets fans saying he was already a top 5 big and everything lmao
"And also, yknow, this was his contract year and he was looking for 40mil...  so no way were we re-signing him.  lol, these pels casuals. ""Just keep jrue"". Yeah, and why didnt we also just keep AD, Christian Wood, and Julius Randle. Piece of cake."
I like how revisionist these comments are -- ya'll are acting like the Rockets wanted to suck. One of their first moves was signing Christian Wood.  They wanted to re-up and Harden didn't like the moves or the franchise anymore.
Christian Wood? Houston shouldn't do that but who knows. Grant would be perfect at the 4 for you guys.
"idk how the Rockets feel about this, but see if Christian Wood is available, though I highly doubt he is. Going big is definitely what should be done, problem is, there aren't too many good options."
And none of this mentions the fact the year before we had Christian Wood on the roster and Griff cut him
All current or former rockets....  Christian Wood you good?
Damn would've been a finals lock with Christian Wood and John Wall as the Houston big 3.
I'd take Christian Wood over any rookie outside the top 4
Christian Wood is untouchable
"I see most people like the idea but I have a different one as well.  The worst team has their players re-drafted by the other lottery teams. The lottery teams can swap any of their players for the player they draft.  For example, if I'm the Magic I take Christian Wood from the Rockets and then replace him with our worst player, Michael-Carter-Williams. Every team repeats this and then the new Rockets team gets sent to the G-League. Suddenly there's no talent disparity."
"This post is pretty dumb and he is not getting traded, but for the sake of arguing, let me see if I can take a stab at naming some players that may be similarly valued...don't bite my head off if you disagree.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Bam Adebayo  Donovan Mitchell (maybe a little more valuable)  Christian Wood  Zach LaVine"
Christian Wood was damn close before the ankle injury.
"Luka, Mitchell and Christian Wood  I would say KAT but I think Bosh during those years is a lot worse than KAT is now"
Touched the mics before testing positive for covid. After a press conference of discussing with reporters that players would be keeping their distance. It's unfortunate he was the first one to return a positive test but it's very possible that Christian Wood was the first player to have it. Oh well it's all a moot point now
Christian Wood = The Crucifix
Christian Wood 2022 MVP
"pretty much. we only drafted two (Frank in 2015 and Zeller in 2013) but we had a bunch around that time  between 2015-16 and 2016-17 we had something like 6 of them. Kaminsky, Zeller, Hawes, Hansbrough, Miles Plumlee, Mike Tobey. and I definitely could be missing one.  We played all of them over a young Christian Wood. Fuck you Steve Clifford."
I've got one more for you...  Christian Wood
Nothing surprises me since Christian Wood exposed Shaq for being a casual analyst
"He's also unathletic and way more limited than Christian Wood because of that, especially on the defensive end. Tall athletic shooters that can finish and create their own shot efficiently almost always have their numbers translate to playoff teams."
How about an actual stretch 5 in Christian Wood?   Russ / Harden / Gordon / Tucker / Wood
Christian Wood for Wiseman? Who says no?
"Houston would have been fine. Definitely not amazing. Westbrook struggled a lot with injuries at the beginning of the year. Eric Gordon was hurt, PJ was terrible offensively, Danuel House was hurt, Christian Wood got hurt. It would have been Harden carrying mediocre role players to a fine record and getting knocked out in the first round."
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I’m not giving you names of point guards to add. I don’t want to invest in point guard. I don’t want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that’s something I’m interested in adding… Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
"Christian Wood,  Eric Gordon for Wiggins and the Minny pick  Warriors get two guys who can help them compete"
"Yeah the Rockets are gonna be in a really good position in a few years. Especially if some of the dudes on their roster keep developing, such as KPJ, JaeSean Tate, Christian Wood, they could get them something on the trade market, or be part of their franchise when they try to compete again eventually."
"Injuries are the biggest issue. Its been hard to see him string a few games before injuring a random body part. He is not lazy nor does he pout like a child like some of our fans say.   Offensively since that Christian Wood highlight that everyone seems to remember, he has done less isolations and allowed the offense to flow more naturally to him. He passes more from the block and offensive rebounds and even tries to pass to our centers/Barnes who have a mismatch. His footwork and upper body strength need some work though, but he's still young. My hope is for Barnes to teach him all of his post moves.  Defense, oh boy its quite bad. His perimeter defense is extremely bad, he is deathly afraid of fouling the other player and is quite often caught flat footed. Interior defense however can definitely improve. He has shown flashes where he defends the likes of Embiid and Zion to a degree. Its more he knows he can't block the shot, but able to give them the worse shot possible. Though its hard to gauge cause our team has been historically awful at defence. When people say shit like ""Oh when Bagley was out, our defence had improved!"" Well no shit, having both Buddy and Bagley out there was fucking bad defensively. You take either of them out and it gets better.   I really do hope Bagley succeeds, if not with us then I hope he averages a 20-10 against us. He has alot of potential, but unfortunately we're the Kangs and our last good big man was Cousins. So yeah."
"Lavine and KAT are inarguably better, but I’ll give you that the other 3 are a toss up and probably in his tier along with sabonis christian wood and FVV"
I seriously wonder if the rockets would even answer the phone if they got offered christian wood for PG
"If it's going to happen, it would be to a guy like Christian Wood who has the skill to be drafted, but teams are hesitant on for some reason. Not that I think Wood will win MVP."
Turning Covington into 2 firsts and Christian Wood on that contract is awesome.
"The Suns would be a title favourite. In this hypothetical, the Suns use their resources to get a center instead of CP3. No Ayton slander but center, in general, is the easiest position to fill in NBA. Clint Capela was gettable. Myles Turner. Ibaka. Steven Adams. Derrick Favours. Christian Wood. Valanciunas.  Even lower-tier centers like Mason Plumlee would probably be fine on this team, and use those resources to get another wing or playmaker.  I think you can find someone that does 50-75% of what Ayton does fairly easily for his role on this team.  I think you have to look at it from the perspective that they used resources on CP3 because the team needed a lead ballhandler and more permitter scoring and playmaking. Luka is still on his rookie deal so those resources can be used in a lot of different places.  And, of course, there is the obvious. Luka is a significantly better player than Ayton. Anyone who says Ayton is really overthinking it. Luka is on his way to his second first All-NBA team. If I had to bet right now. I would take the under on Ayton ever making a first All-NBA team. That doesn't mean he's bad, but barring a big jump he is significantly below AD, Jokic, Embiid and Gobert in the second tier with Capela and Bam."
"Don't forget Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, and Christian Wood"
"He’s used terribly in their offense and he also just plays too passively. Also doesn’t help that his defense sucks now. If he is used more like a better shooting John Collins or Christian Wood, he could be elite again, but right now he’s basically 7’3 PJ Tucker who can’t defend"
"Honestly, they stockpiled a shit ton of assets and just carelessly used or lost some of them/let the players leave in FA.  They're still in a fantastic position, but I'm wondering what this team could be if they had a competent FO.   Just off the top of my head, certain players they had at one point included Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Mikal Bridges"
Christian wood too
"Christian Wood is automatic whenever he gets the ball in the paint.   If Mavs get their hands on him to pair him with Luka, he’s putting up 30 a night."
"Guards: Steph, Dame, Booker, Beal, Kyrie, Trae, Lavine  Wings: KD, Kawhi, Zion, Jimmy  Bigs: Christian Wood, Bam, Draymond, Jarrett Allen  Keep the fools who were on the fIBA team off the olympic team roster and take into account of things such as a guy like Harden probably won't play"
"Someone on another post said it very well, “KP is a stretched out version of Ryan Anderson”. KP is not aggressive and probably thinks about getting injured every time he plays. Imagine Luka with someone like Christian Wood(similar body style to KP and both can hit the three ball) who can rebound, shoot the three, and is not scared to drive."
The US could go with Christian Wood or Jarrett Allen
29/29 teams say no      Christian Wood has a better contract than bumass KP and they have similar play styles
Would have to attach some assets. And I'm not a GM so I don't know if the value would be 1 or 2 protected firsts or whatever... BUT  They should trade KP to the Rockets for Christian Wood and Eric Gordon. I think both of their games would fit well with Luka. Rockets aren't going to be good for a few years anyways so bring back some draft picks.
Trade KP for Christian Wood
Lol shit I forgot about Christian Wood. I see what you’re saying there.
"I think its plausible. I don’t see Houston getting better in the next two/three years unless Kevin Porter Jr. turns into James Harden 2.0. So I fully expect Houston to go full tank. They took Wall, an objectively worse injury prone player, for Westbrook. Why not take Porzingis?  I genuinely think Christian Wood would be a really good fit with Luka. Gordon could be a secondary ball handler or if they don’t want one or both of them they can be flipped for assets because their contracts are much more manageable."
Trade Porzingis for Eric Gordon and Christian Wood. Both are competent and the Rockets front office might be open to doing dumb shit and tanking.
Hopefully Christian Wood next year if his defense improves
"Then like Ibaka, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Nurkic is adding a 3 to his game recently  These guys aren’t very good at it but it’s still something"
"Yea they do in a way, but, in general, they make me root against the franchise but not really the team.   Like the rockets, for example, I want them to convey good picks by being shit but at the same time I really like John Wall, KPJ, &amp; Christian Wood so I want them in particular to play well and have success that brings their teammates success.   With the Clippers I just feel meh towards their team &amp; don’t root for any of their players, on top of already wanting their picks.   Although, it’s easier to root for a lotto team than already cemented playoff team so this point prob don’t even matter"
"He averaged 16 ppg. Houston’s rebuilding team and since John Wall isn’t his usual self, behind him is Christian Wood and KPJ"
13M/yr is Christian Wood/Brook Lopez money.
Yeah and Simmons could elevate his game in a 5 out system. It's why I thought the rockets would be a good destination for him next to christian wood.
Wisemen + picks might get you Christian Wood at best
I think Portland needs to move on from Nurkic and try to get a more defensive minded center like Myles Turner or Christian Wood. That plus a better coach I think could fix it
I think Dame gets the team needs to make moves but they are too good of friends for Dame to hear it. They need an upgrade on Nurkic. They can afford to lose some offense if they can get more defense. Maybe try to get Christian Wood?
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"Seems like this is the largest concession I'm going to get on this from a Mavs fan, so kudos, but it still seems like this is some mental gymnastics to soften the blow of giving up a player who went off for 30 in a playoff game. Sure, Seth has flaws, but you can ALWAYS find a spot on the bench for a guy like that. The fact that Richardson is mostly out of the rotation means you didn't get enough back for Seth. Ergo, you lost the trade.  Don't worry, though-- every team has made this move at some point or another. Moving on from a player before they get better elsewhere. It's hard to make moves on the margins when your team is good and you're just trying to alter things to reach another level. For example, the Bucks had both Norman Powell and Christian Wood on their roster in recent years and gave up on both."
Can we get Christian Wood to Dallas?
I was about to laugh at Houston for trading Capela and a pick for Covington but they later flipped Covington for Christian Wood and 2 first round picks  Houston definitely took a W there also
Christian Wood exposed the Big Casual
"Rockets didnt want him? The Rockets loved him. He was injured for the season and the Rockets window was closing. They got RoCo, who they flipped for 2 FRP's and Christian Wood.  &amp;#x200B;  I dont remember anyone clowing the hawks. I never saw any issues with fit as Collins can space the floor"
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"No, him and the #14 pick for Christian Wood"
Or we flip him for Christian Wood and actually compete before Steph ages out
"Trying to think of teams on which Westbrook would be the best player. Cavs, Magic, Pistons for sure. Arguably Pacers and Rockets (although those teams' best players are bigs and Christian Wood seems more like a great 2nd option than a 1st option). And you could argue for Kings, Thunder and Spurs even though I'd disagree with you.  So probably not"
"Also king of long 2s! But defense is always on and he makes the right decisions. In off-season I preferd Christian wood. In the playoffs, I think I prefer jae"
Christian Wood looking like it as well.
He has to be better than Christian Wood and Jonas Valanciunas next season at the very least.
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"Certainly. Heat got completely killed on the boards today and have been this entire series.   A Myles Turner, Christian Wood trade would be something to really push for this offseason."
"Bud never plays young players or deep bench player. He is all about consistency. We could have had Christian Wood playing for us but no, he only play in garbage time. We could have signed him to a shit contract and he would be a awesome 5 to put next to Giannis."
"Yeah lol. This says more about the Atlantic division than anything.  Like let’s look at central division: Giannis, Sabonis, LaVine, Sexton, Jerami Grant  Southeast: Trae, Butler, Beal and Westbrook, Lamelo and Hayward, not sure who on the magic  Northwest: Mitchell/Conley or Gobert (first scoring option vs best played), Jokic, Dame, KAT, Shai  Pacific: CP3 and Booker, Kawhi, PG, Lebron and AD, Steph, Fox  Southwest: Doncic, Ja, DeRozen, Zion, Not sure about if rockets would be KPJ, Christian Wood etc.  I’d say only the Pacific has a better list of first options and even that might be somewhat arguable depending on how people rank some of the guys mentioned."
"Oof the ignorance in this comment is ridiculous lol  * Gobert didn’t cry about missing all-star, go back and watch the video - he cried when he was talking about his mom. Gtfo with toxic masculinity, too; why can’t the guy show emotions?  * Do you honestly think the league wouldn’t have shut down anyway? Christian Wood tested positive like the same day, do you think they wouldn’t have put a stop to it then?  You kinda suck as a person"
If you think that then you have the analytical abilities of a two year old. It’s almost a a certainty that Christian Wood gave Rudy Covid but even disregarding that it was coming to the league no matter what. If Gobert doesn’t get it then the league was shutting down a couple weeks later at absolute best. Every nba player pushes and flops. You have to be really naïve to think Gobert does that more than others.
"That shit drove me crazy, man. All reporters, pundits, rumors, bloggers, and even Giannis' barber said they're hearing Giannis is staying and has made no indication toward leaving. Meanwhile, Riley tanked our offseason -- and thus, these playoffs -- because he felt otherwise. Jerami was available, Ibaka was available, Christian Wood was available, etc. Turns out we could've given Jerami the leading scorer thing he wanted since we sure need reliable scoring."
"To clarify a bit further, he just happened to have a positive test come in first. Christian Wood, who was playing with COVID symptoms for several games, is likely the first player who contracted it and is almost certainly who Gobert got it from.   Several other players from other teams had positive results rolling in shortly after playing against Wood."
"In a sense, one of the secrets to Randle's success is that he's finally on a team that gave him a shot to lead, and he was ready for it.   All this time he was like Christian Wood. LA didn't care to develop him (they didn't want to be patient with D'Lo or Lonzo either), Pelicans thought he's not worth retaining, and no other team made him a priority in free agency because of his ball dominant post-play. Everybody wants 3/D and ""stretch big"" skills.  He ends up on the Knicks as a short term gamble (alongside another talented gamble in Bobby Portis). He finds himself on a young team willing to let him lead, with a no-nonsense old-school coach, and his 3pt shooting also took a huge turn around at the perfect time.  He's the perfect MIP, both due to circumstance and skill."
Christian wood would’ve gotten more votes then
Detroit pistons          nuns             🤝  Committing to life without Christian Wood
Damn the Christian Wood MIP campaign really got flatlined?
"I guess, but I still don't really think that holds water. He upped his ppg by like 5, doubled his assists, and his 3 point shooting exploded.  Jerami Grant and Christian wood just got to be a focal point of their offenses on shit teams. I get voting for them, but I don't really know who else you'd put besides Randle."
"&gt;Detroit, Houston  Jerami Grant and Christian Wood are far better all-around players than Joe.  Joe is a specialist"
Jerami Grant is easily better. Christian Wood and KPJ are both easily better.
"Hawks get worse. Simmons absolutely has to play in a 5 out offense to maximize his effectiveness. This year, we don't play any 5 out because it's blasphemous to ever keep Embiid on the perimeter and Dwight is an excellent rebounder and the worst floor spacer in the league. Capela also has to be in the paint. The Rockets funnily enough had a perfect pairing with Christian Wood. Vucevic, Horford and KAT also work. Most centers won't work. He averaged like 19/7/7 playing with Horford.   For the Sixers, can you imagine Kyrie/Harden on Seth Curry/Trae? If we did get Trae, we'd probably have to start Thybulle, and we're back to a similar offensive problem."
"What's the value of Christian Wood? Warriors have a lot of assets, so what's the right mix? Wiseman and #14 this year?"
Minnesota pick + Wiseman for Christian Wood is a ridiculous overpay.  GSW own 2021 pick + Wiseman for Wood + Houston future 2nd round pick  Houston gets to accelerate their rebuild with two lottery talents that fit their timeline  Warriors get a floor spacing centre for the next two seasons
"Also Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Landry Shaker, possibly? Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Iguodala, Lou Will"
But he wasn’t in Utah. That’s like saying if someone in Africa was in Wuhan and saying you know how unlikely that he got it early on lol. Some other douche told me that christian wood got it first. Look all your opinions are like assholes I saw what I saw. First to be diagnosed and touching all the mics and then Mitchell got it. We don’t need to dive deep here.
Christian Wood is an offensive TALENT. But I feel like KPJ is a mix of Harden n Westbrook.  Emotionally I think he'll be fine from here on out.   Imo either KPJ is the future of Houston and/or whoever they draft top 4!
christian wood would like to know your location
This is wrong. It was actually Christian Wood that started it
"I don't know what we'd do if we added two more young guards. I feel like we have to be trading at least one of those picks. Putting together a package for Christian Wood would be great. Minnesota pick, Wiseman, plus filler (Mulder/Smailagic?) for Wood? If the Minny pick ends up being #4 or 5 I could see that being enough"
"He shot sixty against a league built to stop him, with multiple 280 pound behemoths on each roster, and multiple players in the lane at all times.  Today, he'd be going against Christian Wood, and Blake Griffin, and Chris Boucher, and company."
"In the words of my very own Rockets' Christian Wood:  Shaq, you're a casual."
Man they were talking like they got Christian wood when they traded for him
"IMO they could easily get some combination of psuedo-stars like Lonzo, Hayward, Christian Wood, Covington, etc.  Getting 2-3 players like that while also subtracting Wiseman would be huge."
I would go for a big who can contribute right away and move Wiseman for another piece like Christian Wood. They just got beat up so many times inside and Klay coming back won't fix that.
Wiseman and the Minnesota pick for Christian Wood
Christian Wood &amp; Eric Gordon?
Christian wood trade would lowkey makes sense. Think the Warriors would have to add a protected FRP down the line for wood tho
Myles Turner or Christian wood
"I heard they salvaged a booster, I think it was named Christian Wood?"
"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here’s just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De’Aaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D’Angelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
I mean Christian Wood played at an All Star level when healthy last year.  It's not some run of the mill backup big or average starter we are talking about here.  Or some overrated point guard like Russell who prevented you from getting Lamelo who was clearly an upgrade immediately.
"If the Rockets offered 2 for Edwards, Minnesota would say no.  If the Rockets offered 2 for Lamelo, Jordan would laugh at them, bet them on the Yankee game, and tell them he’d give Christian Wood buckets. Then he’d hang up.  Golden State might take the pick for Wiseman, so they can trade it."
I dont know why but I just feel like a Wiseman + picks for Christian Wood trade is inevitable
"Wouldn’t say they have “0 talent” Kevin Porter Jr., Christian Wood, and JaeSean Tate all seem like hoopers. That’ll be a good core around Jalen Green or whoever Houston picks"
"Christian Wood is here, very good player just waiting to play..."
"Because he’s not at his lowest value. Last year was actually pretty promising to people who understand the development of a center and how little experience wiseman has. He’s still only 20 and has plenty of time to learn, so would have very high value for a rebuilding team. The rockets come to mind with Christian wood in a trade right off the bat, which would definitely bolster the warriors starting lineup"
"Look. Around. The. Thread.  And yeah, CJ is better than everyone on a bottom of the league team. He should get a gold star for that.  And I'm not even 100% convinced he's better than Christian Wood, but I'll give it to you."
"Christian wood is worth paschall, wiseman, and the 14th"
Imagine blowing 3 Lottery picks plus a rotation player for christian wood of all people. That would genuinely be the worst trade in history. That type of package would be for an allstar not for a player who hasn't had a healthy season and is overrated af
"I think I like the Rockets' overall collection of assets. #2 overall, all the Nets picks, Christian Wood could fetch a nice price, and KPJ is a nice young player to keep or trade."
Part of me feels like the Warriors won’t do the conventional “chase stars that fit the timeline.” They have a chance with this draft plus Wiseman from last year to have three lottery guys to be under the umbrella of the vets while still being competitive. They may trade Wiggins or something and a future pick for some extra help now but it seems like they could have a young core to develop and help Steph into his twilight and into retirement. No way they throw that chance away for a Christian Wood/Vucevic/Jonas/Turner
i like the christian wood trade for them i think it would be great for both sides
Steven Adams  Also Christian Wood is so overrated on this sub
We'll trade Christian wood for steph curry. No take backs.
"for Myles Turner who's 2021-22 salary is $17.5mil then yeah but for Christian Wood (averaged 21/10) who's salary is only $13.6mil, you can just send Wiseman ($9.1mil) and Looney ($5.1mil) (assuming Looney doesn't opt out via his player option)"
Christian Wood?
"The Warriors shouldn't trade Wiggins because yes he's overpaid but he's still a very solid 4th option and was an above average defender in Golden State this past year, and if the Warriors trade him, they'll still have a hole in the frontcourt. They should go after a center like Myles Turner or Christian Wood with Wiseman, #7, and #14."
"Christian Wood, John Wall, KPJ"
4 FRPs for Christian Wood
Christian Wood was shitting on Giannis as well IIRC
"In the final season they surrounded Harden with John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, and Christian Wood. They were telling Harden that the window was closed"
"Why wasn’t it Christian wood, he didn’t want it?"
Christian wood is a good shout
Christian Wood snubbed
"Man Pop's team is really working for veteran presence over all else. Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, even Christian Wood are all better players than McGee right now."
"I was saying the Rockets shouldn't be planning their draft strategy around Christian Wood. If they have Mobley rated as better than Green and Suggs, they shouldn't pass on him because of Wood."
Christian wood is 100% better than lopez lmao. Not prime lopez but definitely current lopez.
"Christian Wood is not better than Brook Lopez, he has better upside (duh) but he isn’t better"
Wouldn't want to have to move on from future star... Christian Wood?
"Two is tough, since Cunningham is basically consensus 1, but then different people have Mobley and Green either 2 or 3 with some Suggs supporters.   I just hope they aren't passing on Mobley because of Christian Wood."
"Is he? even if he is.  Christian wood is still better player than Javale  I get the idea, But that rule does not affect the flow of the game, as much as we think it will.  Also Javale is not near as bouncy as he once was.  Last point, grabbing rebounds and blocks takes a lot more than being bouncy.  Positioning, timing, strength, and BBIQ play a huge role in that.   Javale has been weak in most of those areas for the past two years."
I'm sorry but Christian Wood is 10x the defender that Javale fucking McGee is lmfao
SGA and Christian Wood
"I'd have preferred Christian Wood myself but McGee and Keldon aren't bad choices because they can both affect the game without needing any ball usage, which is what Team USA lacks right now. We need better defense and rebounding and size."
"r/nba during the games: we need players that can play a role, hustle, play hard and don’t need the ball in their hands.  Also r/nba: WHY THE HELL DIDN’T YOU ADD TRAE YOUNG, ZION WILLIAMSON, CHRISTIAN WOOD AND DEAARON FOX?"
"Can’t Christian Wood or Jarret Allen or Myles Turner do the same while also bringing more offensive skill, and without any of the baggage McGee brings?"
Isn't myles turner sidelined for an entire season? I don't think calling a player that has been sidelined for a long time to play on a different rule is good idea.   Jarett allen is RFA and don't want to injure himself while idk about christian wood but there are rumour about him rejecting the invitation  I thought they will call mason plumlee lmao
Christian Wood doesn't fit their timeline
"Weren't the stories that were posted on here essentially only saying ""Team USA is thinking about adding (Christian Wood/whoever)?""  Don't think I ever saw anything saying anyone knew Christian Wood had any reciprocal interest if they asked him."
"Seriously, have they even asked Miles Turner yet? What about Christian Wood? Wth is going on?"
Did Christian Wood migrate to Antarctica
I dispute the notion that they specifically need to go for a big/C at all costs but I would rather add Julius Randle or Christian Wood as 2 names spending 2 seconds thinking about it off top of my head.
Christian wood if he accepts would be better.
It’s Christian Wood time
"Yes it does, Mobley is only 215 pounds he’s not gonna be a solid rim protector at first, they’re gonna use him like Christian wood and then if you need to play small ball he will the 5. He can shoot 3s alright which they hope he will develop into good. He can guard 3s and 4s. He can operate with the ball and is very good from midrange. It’s almost a perfect fit next to Allen."
Myles Turner. Christian Wood. Thomas Bryant.
Christian Wood exists lol
Christian Wood!!!
Christian Wood time!
Christian Wood time
Christian Wood time
Send in Christian wood
"Trae deserves a spot over Christian Wood without a doubt, he proved himself these playoffs."
"Zions defense is suspect.  Like .. remember when Harden didn't even try to defend?  Thats what Zion resembles most of the time.  He'd be a great lob threat, tho.     We need a big to park their ass in the paint and block shots.  Jarret Allen would be nice, altho I believe he already turned down an invite... maybe  myles Turner.  Dont know who else is available - heard they're trying to get Christian Wood"
"If they load up excessive picks and Kemba for Brad Beal. Then picks for Christian Wood. Then picks in a 3 way for Ben Simmons.   Then SGA goes to the next level or two. As in, all-NBA.   Maybe they could do it.   - Simmons   - SGA   - Beal   - Dort   - Wood   Thats a solid lineup."
"&gt; In terms of other big men that are above average, there’s Christian Wood  You sir are a gentleman and a scholar"
Christian Wood could be a stretch 5
some good old homegrown American Christian Wood
christian wood could do a good job.
Christian Wood perhaps?
"In the Duncan Robinson thread: ""this team needs rim protection and playmaking!!""  In the Christian Wood thread: ""perfect!""  Give me Nerlens lol"
"Would you consider Christian Wood to be better than Allen? I feel like he was having an all-star level season before his injury, but he's been way under the radar since then"
But haven't you heard? James Wiseman is the next David Robinson! He speaks Chinese! Does Christian Wood speak Chinese?
Christian Wood time ?
"I wonder if the Rockets would be looking at trading Christian Wood to Warriors of a Wiseman+picks package.   Realistically it would give the Warriors an immediate upgrade for Wiseman, and gives the Rockets more future assets.   Assuming a Wood for Wiseman, pick 7 and pick 14 (probably a lot but either way), it would give the Rockets pick 2, 7, 14, 23, 24 as well as Wiseman and KPJ. So not sure what Detroit’s asking price would be for Cade, but Houston can definitely make some moves."
I wonder if Tilman is interested in offloading the cap hit of Christian Wood in exchange for moving up 1 spot in the draft
"You know that they had massive roster overhaul and injuries and most of the team only played like 15-20 games together?   And they're not more talented. They're a G League team plus Christian Wood, who is an decent player but would be shut down.   Australia has waaaaay more talent than Houston."
Christian Wood is an all star level player IMO though
"Most international teams only have at most one player better than Christian Wood, the Rockets probably have the 2 to 5th best players against most teams"
"Realistic options: Christian Wood or Myles Turner  Unrealistic: Anthony Edwards, DeAndre Ayton, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"
"Noel and Embiid were both injury concerns, which explains the Okafor pick decently well. There were also reports that Hinkie was ready to sell high on Okafor the spring of or summer after his rookie season, a la MCW, but he was fired too quickly.  As far as talent evaluation goes, people always seem to forget he was responsible for taking chances on several players who have been contributors to playoff teams. TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerami Grant, and Christian Wood to name a few.  I think he would've shined the most retooling a championship contender, in the ilk of his old mentor, Morey. His real strengths were less in the lottery and more in the late second round, acquisition of G Leaguers/undrafted players, and trades. All things the Sixers could use now."
"Nope, the return of Christian Wood"
"He could but the upgrade to the roster is marginal at best since the Warriors need shooting way more than playmaking. With Steph and Dray Warriors' playmaking is already very good but playmakers need someone to playmake for. Keeping Wiggins and using Wiseman + 7 + 14 to make a run for Christian Wood or someone of that caliber is probably better for the Warriors in terms of roster construction. If they can add playmaking big for the MLE or minimum that's worth it, trading all their assets including a starting caliber 3&amp;D wing for a luxury position is not worth it"
"&gt; Second, are you really saying you would rather have Cunningham over Jalen Green/Mobley, KPJ, Christian Wood, and several first round picks?  WTF? Yes. Absolutely. I'll take a dollar over a couple quarters and a couple dimes. What kind of question is that?  Weaver traded the pick for a reason. The protections on the pick were structured that way for a reason. No, they don't want that pick back.   They let Wood go because he has an attitude problem. No, they don't want him back."
Remember when Shaq didn't know who Christian Wood was
kpj/jalen green/jaesean tate/kj martin/christian wood isnt a bad core
Christian Wood has played 1 year in houston?
"The only other possible deal i could see is with Golden State:  To Warriors: Christian Wood  To Rockets: #1  To Pistons: #2, Wiseman, #14  Warriors keep the #7/Wiggins to use in another deal if needed. Or they can draft a player that can help them win now at #7 (dont know if that's even a possibility) and keep Wiggins on the roster.  Pistons add #2 and get Wiseman (2020 #2), #14, Pistons owed pick from Houston  Houston gets #1 for Wood/Detroit's pick."

"What about... Moses Brown or Christian Wood? I've honestly never really even seen either play, but I took them for prop multi parters (Westbrook to have 10+ asts, Brown to have 9 rebs) a ton because I hate taking the stars because their numbers are so high. Those 2, Garland &amp; Sexton became 4 of my favorite players just from betting player props. But I'm not all that familiar with their actual games. I did notice when I was looking for a theoretical trade partner for CJ for a big or dicking around and trading Embiid instead of Simmons (yeah I know. Just seeing what kind of team I could put together with better value from embiid)... Brown and Wood were 2 of the main guys I kept coming back to"
Christian Wood is still there
"First of all, the Rockets best asset is probably their own 2022 pick. They also have their own 2023 (with a BKN swap option). Second, are you really saying you would rather have Cunningham over Jalen Green/Mobley, KPJ, Christian Wood, and several first round picks?   I don't feel like the argument makes much sense that it is a bunch of stuff they already got rid of.  KPJ never even played for the Pistons, he was traded for 4 picks so it wasn't like they just let him go, and his value is way higher now than it was when he was pick 30.  Christian Wood's value is also a little higher than it was when he left.  Why is it relevant that one of the picks that would be involved is technically the Pistons pick? Do you not want that pick back?"
"Except Christian Wood, but why would Houston offer that to move up one spot. Plus he was traded from the pistons recently."
Yeah that's better. My other initial one was Jaxson Hayes but he's not at this level yet. Christian Wood also crossed my mind.
"this... not true at all. Seth is good at 8 million. But there's Jokic at 29 million, Sabonis at 18 million, Christian Wood at 13 million, Chris Boucher at 6 million, Richaun Holmes at 4.8 million. Honestly, even some of the big contracts like Bradley Beal at 25 million give significantly more value. Hell, his brother is way better value per dollar at 40 million."
A Christian Wood or Jarrett Allen option would give the coaches something totally different to work with.  I hate this roster construction.
"I’m a Dame and Beasley fan, but they aren’t going to run a team against international players. They need Conley and Lowry. Christian Wood instead a lot of those PF’s bc he will play D and grab boards, shit even Jarret Allen."
"Tilman: *That’s It!!! They’re not getting Christian Wood now, either!!!*!"
Sleeper who might end up coming for this crown with more games played: Christian Wood
"&gt;The only other contemporary volume scorer (i.e. not a low ppg center on offense) who has hit 80% from within 3ft over a season is KD  Christian Wood averaged 21 ppg and shot 81% at the rim (and is a ridiculous 79% at the rim for his career), but yes Giannis is insane. I'm curious who the all-time leader for career percentage at the rim is, because Wood has to be up there. Giannis is at 74% for comparison."

"Zubac maybe a top 5 centre? Jokic, Embiid, KAT, Bam, Ayton, Gobert, Capella, Vucevic all dead or something? And then there's Christian Wood, Nurkic, Valanciunas who a strong majority would say are better than Zubac, that's 11 already."
"What do you consider successful? Ben Simmons  is a 6’11 point guard, what about porzingis? Jokic? Giannis can move like magic Johnson at times, Christian wood has been good as well"
Plus Christian Wood is an UFA in 2 years. Makes no sense to draft for fit when he might just leave if they still suck by then
"I'm not gonna lie, I think the Rockets would be dumb to let KPJ or Christian Wood factor into the decision of who to take at all. You're an awful team at the beginning of a rebuild, caring about fit at this point makes no sense. De'Aaron Fox was better than either of them and we still see how dumb it was for the Kings to let fit affect their decision.   You always take BPA with any top 3 pick."
With Jerami Grant and Christian Wood coming off the bench.
"I doubt our front office would even consider dealing for Christian Wood again, tbh."
Give us Christian Wood back
players not drafted here that should be in over some of these players  SGA  Sabonis   Christian wood  Vucevic  Miles Bridges  Kevin Love  Collin Sexton  lemelo
Suns - Christian Wood plz
Christian Wood- sudowoodo
PG: Trae Young  SG: James Harden  SF: PJ Tucker  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Christian Wood  EDIT:Current NBA only
"I understood, i just thought it was dumb because it literally is Christian Wood money. Just because he's underpaid doesn't mean he's not making that #. We can't compare contracts because a guy is underpaid? I didn't misunderstand you, I just thought it was stupid."
"I don't think anyone is sleeping on the Hornets, but I think they'll be as good as the 6th seed, floor is 9th. Graham being gone might actually help them not have a log jam at guard, but I looked him on this team.  I think the Rockets and Pacers are good sleepers.  I really like the players the Rockets have like Christian Wood, John Wall, Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr among others, and their head coach.  I don't like how the roster had played over the last few seasons for the Pacers, but Rick Carlisle is a big reason why I think they could surprise people.   I want to say the Magic so bad, but Jonathan Isaac will be out a lot of the season, but Fultz is coming back with Cole and Suggs. They still have Ross and MCW off the bench too, but I know nothing about Jamahl Mosley"
"completely different players. Christian Wood is a fantastic offensive player who needs to improve his defense and passing, Rob is a defensive force that can guard 1-5 but who can really only score off lobs and putbacks, but has also shown flashes of becoming a very good passer one day.  Rob will probably never be as good of a scorer and Christian will probably never be the defender that Rob is, and that's fine."
We released Christian Wood for those 53 mins I’ll have you know
"Lmao why don't both you idiots read a little.   I literally said above I wouldn't call it Christian Wood money because his contract isn't really fair value to represent him. Therefore, calling it that and comparing the two contracts doesn't make sense.  I used stephs 11m per year contract as a comparison (and before you idiots say anything more I'm comparing  contract value and not players)  Is that clearer for all you? Idiots"
"Also cost the Bucks Christian Wood's roster spot, which would've been much bigger for them. Still probably doesn't break in the rotation much behind Lopez and Giannis, but they could've gotten some assets for Wood rather than letting him go for nothing."
"Yeah I was more just saying that “Christian Wood money” sort of implies that Rob Williams is being overpaid because he makes the same as a better player, but in reality this is a good contract for the Celtics and Wood is just currently being very underpaid."
It's about what Christian Wood is making though so it is Christian Wood money
I wouldn't call it christian wood money cause I think Wood is actually a bit underpaid at that price
Christian Wood money  That’s a steal because he’s gonna be very good
"They didn’t stop trying. Their best player, Christian Wood, got hurt, which prompted the losing streak. Go watch the press conference with Steven Silas when they hit 20 straight losses, that was not a dude not trying to win. He was devastated. Point me to specific lineups he put out there.   The Thunder were 19-24 before their best player got hurt as well. And the Al Horford move was as much about wanting to play young players who the team was interested in as it was about tanking. The Thunder’s coaches and players played extremely hard last year. They may have been Sabotaged by the FO shipping out all the vets, but they weren’t sabotaged by the coaches. They certainly would not have beat the Clippers in the last game if that was the case.   Think about your team next year, now imagine you have some big injury problems. Super young  rebuilding teams have the bottom fall out when that happens."
"My bad let me put on Siakam cooking AD&amp; the lake show couple months back. No no let me put him dropping 40+ on PHX. No no thats regular season rocket talk.   Ohhhh Game 1 NBA Finals. How many straight field goals? 32 points on 14-of-17 shooting, with eight rebounds, five assists, a steal and two blocks  You probably think Christian Wood is better 😂 goof trooper FOH"
"I don’t think you’d win a game with a random top 25 NCAA team. Those teams have maybe a couple NBA level talents but depth pieces on college squads would have no chance against NBA players. Also, in this scenario, your team is also playing a regular 82 game season. Take UCLA last year. Ended up a top 10 team, only one guy playing key minutes was over 6’8. Their best player in the tourney run, Juzang, couldn’t get a first round valuation because he’s a defensive liability on the wings. You can poke similar holes in pretty much any NCAA squad.   The Rockets were the worst team in the league last year, but Christian Wood, John Wall, KPJ, Olynyk etc. is soooo much better than a college team. 20-21 Rockets would easily win the NCAA title."
Heat could’ve re-signed Jae and got Christian Wood last year instead of saving cap space for Giannis
This years Christian wood
Christian Wood  Jalen Green  Alperen Sengun  Kevin Porter Jr  Usman Garuba  Kenyon Martin Jr  Armoni Brooks  Jae’Sean Tate   Josh Christopher
Christian Wood  MPJ (if Murray is out)  Fox
"I wouldn't change anything before the 2019 chip, don't wanna mess with that timeline.  Since then? Maybe sign Christian Wood to a long term deal before he blew up."
"Deaaron fox/Christian wood in west.  I like fox more than morant for next year and a big has a better chance of making it but I don’t think phx gets 3 all stars so tough for ayton.  West I’ll go Tobias Harris or brogdon,  Tobias will get more credit next year with the Simmons stuff and I think Indiana is going be competitive and brogdon will be one of their best players"
East- Collin Sexton West- Christian Wood
Christian Wood
Rockets:   - Jalen Green - Alperen Sengun - Usman Garuba - Josh Christopher - Kevin Porter JR - Christian Wood - Jae'sean Tate - KJ Martin
"I feel like there is a ton of talent on the Rockets with their first rounders from this year along with Christian wood, Wall and Gordon. It will be interesting to see if they prioritize the youth or give their vets the majority of the minutes. Could go either way but I think the better bet is to give the young guys some run"

Didn't Christian Wood call Shaq a casual? So is Shaq a casual or is Wood for calling him that?
"That list of moves makes him an average GM. Picking up CP3 was the only elite move you mentioned. We also got Ariza on a filthy deal back in the day, which you didn't name.  Doesn't make him a top 5 GM, and the Harden trade doesn't make up for the difference. He doesn't understand stability or how to value talent. We cut/traded guys like Christian Wood, DeAnthony Melton, Robert Covington, etc. all because Morey doesn't understand talent. Our draft record was horrendous and then we didn't make a first round pick for 4 straight years before this one. He left our franchise in shambles and Stone has been building it up to a better point than Morey ever did."
"Plus, it didn't hurt us really. Tony Bradley was fun to watch, but probably won't be much more than a backup. And if I'm wrong and becomes a potential star (a la Christian Wood), then I'll eat crow but he wouldn't really blossom into that role behind Embiid anyway. Worst case we traded him before he was at peak value.  Only other thing we gave up were 2nd round picks. All in all it was a wash that had potential at the time, so I wouldn't really think of it as a con."
Going from Steph to Christian Wood... ouch
Christian Wood is a top 2 player on an NBA team. Love all the process kids that made it big.
Shit you're right. My post is actually totally wrong our best players are Christian Wood and one of Wall/Porter/Green.
Surely Christian Wood is better than KPJ
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
Christian Wood!! Fingers crossed
Christian Wood &gt; Tim Dunked-On
Christian Wood.
This might fall in the SGA category and he was only a late pick because of that back injury but MPJ could definitely take his game it all-star level. I also think Christian Wood is incredibly underrated and if he was on a competitive team he can grow into a beast
RJ Barrett  Malik Monk  Cole Anthony  Kevin Huerter  Rui Hachimura  Christian Wood  Keldon Johnson  Justise Winslow  Pat Connaughton  Malcolm Brogdon  Anfernee Simons  Spencer Dinwiddie  Immanuel Quickley
"Which top rookie plays winning basketball for a non-lottery team though? It's so rare in the first place.  I don't see why the 6ers couldn't build around whatever talent Jahlil did have. Cause he had some talent, there's no denying it. Even more than Drummond. It just sucked that the NBA moved away from post-play without giving him a fair shot, and the 6ers obliged since they were tanking away every year.  Teams iced him out like Christian Wood was iced out for years."
"At this point probably Simmons, another player who is up there is wiggins due to his contract.  Lavine, SGA and Norman Powell are incredibly efficient scorers (although norm struggled in portland). I have Lavine and SGA in my top 20.  Derozan gets left out quite a lot.  Christian Wood is better than Karl-Anthony Towns  Brogdon is better than Sabonis, as is myles turner."
"Christian Wood, Darius Garland, RJ Barrett are a few that come to mind"
Christian Wood. Mic drop.
Jae’Sean Tate or Christian Wood.
Christian Wood
"A player so bad he shot better at the rim than Ayton, Bam, Gobert (the most efficient player in nba history) and everyone else in the league but 2 of the 3 most efficient rim finishers since we started tracking that (LeBron and Giannis  with the 2nd most efficient rim finishing season ever recorded) and Christian Wood who was 2nd and more efficient than LeBron."

"&gt;That's what makes Hinkie such an enigma. He had some amazing draft picks and undrafted free agent signings, but also let a lot of them go so I don't know how much credit to give him.   Yeah the big question mark with Hinkie is his talent evaluation/team-building ability which we never saw. The OP lists players that were part of ""The Process"" at one point or another but apart from the 1st rounders the only players that they identified and actually leveraged for on-court success or asset value are RoCo and TJ. It's not an achievement to have Christian Wood or Ish Smith on your team for two minutes when those guys were being passed around from bad team to bad team at one point.  Plus there was the criticism that you can take tons of fliers on guys like this, but how much are they going to get to show when playing alongside rookies and other fliers/journeymen instead of instilling good habits. It's not a foregone conclusion that Jerami Grant/Christian Wood/Richaun Holmes etc wouldn't become as good as they did on other teams but the fact they did blow up elsewhere doesn't retroactively make Hinkie look better to me"
"&gt;That's what makes Hinkie such an enigma. He had some amazing draft picks and undrafted free agent signings, but also let a lot of them go so I don't know how much credit to give him.   I don't want to say he gets no credit, but part of the reason for this is that they cycled through a ton of low-end prospects without actually giving them much of a chance to develop. When you have that many different young players coming through your doors, it's easier to put together a list in hindsight of all the ones who turned out to be good. But it's also not a coincidence that a lot of those guys were either 1) traded for peanuts the second they showed any promise, or 2) blossomed after leaving Philly. For example, it's hard to give Hinkie much credit for drafting Christian Wood, cuz if he actually realized the quality of player Wood was gonna be he would have stuck around for more than 17 games."
"I think they rostered about 25 players each of the first two years of the Process, so it makes sense that a bunch eventually ended up flourishing. But it also speaks to the nature of the Process that only a handful of them flourished on the Sixers, because Hinkie was churning through so many players.        Christian Wood only played 145 minutes total for the Sixers, for example."
Christian Wood
"Sengun dominating summer league isn’t that surprising, he was a beast against competition in Europe. I don’t think it’ll be that surprising if he’s a solid scorer against NBA players either, but I think the biggest question for him will be how playable is he as a defender when he has to close out or switch on NBA guards, and how quick can he rotate. I would question his rim protection as a Center as well, but luckily he will be paired with Christian Wood, which should help cover him and should make for a pretty solid duo."

Christian wood
I feel like Christian wood and Collins are at similar levels
That translation was pretty bad. She generalized everything he said and obviosuly didn't translate the full questions he got (like the Christian Wood question).
"Gotta go with my man Stone... In less than one year, the Rockets went from Harden/Westbrook/Covington led team to a young core of:  Christian Wood Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr. Jae'sean Tate Alperen Sengun Usman Garuba Joshua Christopher  And a crapload of future 1st round picks/swaps."
I think for him especially because ball handling and playmaking is clearly his weak point right now. You put him next to KPJ and Christian Wood and just let him have more catch and shoot/iso opportunities and he'll do great. Dude is already looking like a very good shooter from summer league and Gleague.
I swear Christian wood posts are the next to get banned like Jimmy Butler posts lmaoo
"Maybe talk to him and see if he will be open to an extension and even talk numbers to him. I think depending on what he says to that, you have to consider trading him around the deadline if he’s having a great season.  Christian Wood is great, but if he isn’t open to resigning here and wants to go content sooner, the Rockets should trade him at his peak value.   Edit: Wrote out “I love Wood” and had to delete it after I read this aloud lol"
"No, Christian Wood is the perfect age for where he can be a part of the youth movement while being a bonafide leader/1st option.   He’ll be 26 in September and will be entering/in his prime by the time guys like Jalen Green/Kevin Porter Jr. truly break out. He’s awesome value at around $13 million a year."
"John wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, DJ Augustin and Christian wood don’t match the timeline.   Then again he has 2 more years before his deal expires? I would wait until his last year if there are signs that he is not going to resign. He can also provide good experience for the rookies same as the other players mentioned above."
"I know, it’s weird Harden totally quit on his team isn’t it 😂 Russ was traded, but Harden literally gave up on that rocket’s team that he was on, with Wall and Christian Wood, to follow KD and Kyrie on a superteam.   Russ? He went to the wizards and Beal praised him for his leadership as well. You’re really stretching yourself to prove a point that no one who matters actually agrees with. It’s pathetic."
"Crazy, but it feels like we've completely forgotten about Christian Wood as well. This team is going to be fun to watch."
There really aren’t many. If you look at first and second team all summer league 2019 they all panned out &amp; even 2018 Christian Wood made it but no one really gave him a shot until this year
Sengun is going to be so much better than Christian Wood
"He absolutely hates the fuckin rockets lol I remember when Simmons asked his opinion on our roster post draft, and the most he can muster is “are we sure Christian wood is actually good”"

"Yeah, I was mostly talking playoffs, where Russ was injured and most definitely dog water. I'm just saying that I wish that Harden ran it back with a healthy Russ because maybe through some butterfly effect bullshit Rockets could realistically have a chance to win a ring.  Literally all of this is speculation but, I think James Harden, Russ, Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, and Christian Wood are better than the Suns and Bucks. I really loves Russ so I'm tired of seeing missed opportunities keeping us from a ring (CP3, Russ being injured his only playoffs here, Fertitta's existence)."
"There definitely is enough talent, they just keep pooling to the same 4-5 teams. If we have two more team's, that's a couple more max contracts to lure big fish away from the mega markets. Would it actually work like that? Probably not but there is a lot of talent.  And yes, those teams have a lot of talent. SGA, Christian Wood, Haliburton &amp; Fox, Jerami Grant, Ingram, Sexton, Jarret Allen, KAT.  A handful of the teams you're mentioning were big teams just a few years ago. The rockets, thunder, magic, and Cavs are in planned tank modes to acquire young talent. The Pistons are going to be very good soon. Kings, Pelicans and Wolves have a lot of talent but need to get their shit in order (put the magic in this category as well, but not as much promise at the moment)."
"Just look at how long it took Christian Wood to get a legit opportunity. I remember seeing him for a few minutes in the G League on a fucking Twitch stream and being super impressed at his talent. Yet it took years for pro scouts, GMs, and coaches to give him an actual chance."
"Lmao chill with the AD comparison. I think Christian Wood is the most accurate reference as far as ceiling/optimistic outlook (I guess people call him a poor man's AD anyways), right now Kai reminds me a lot of him in his first couple seasons in the league. Super bouncy and plays with a ton of energy but a little too lanky for his own good and needs to add a lot of strength before he's able to effectively bang down low and shows flashes of perimeter skills but still a little awkward with more time needed to build the coordination."
Trade Christian Wood + picks if the Rockets have any for SGA
Plus borderline all star Christian Wood   Plus the second most first round picks in the league (up to 2027)
"It all depends on wtf Fertitta plans to do with the Rockets.  I could totally just see him saying fuck it, and feeding the ball to Jalen Green while sitting Wall/Gordon, and basically turning it into a 3 man team with Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and an island of misfit toys around them.   Meanwhile the Pistons have a pretty promising young core/starting lineup, and guys like Jerami Grant that'll take up a lot of scoring and shots.     IMO Cade will have the better year from an eye-test standpoint, but Jalen Green will have the stats advantage."
Enjoy the lottery and your best player being Christian wood. Or is it John wall? Or the guy who hasn’t even played a game?
"Iko is like 90% of the reason I’m subscribed. It’s more of the national media guys who clearly don’t know anything about the team other than Christian wood and KPJ who annoy me. Even during the Harden era writers like Harper and Hollinger would suggest trades which are terrible for us, or rank us lower than clearly worse teams without giving any justification. You can tell who really watches the team and who doesn’t."
As I said no one with just Shooters is carrying a team to the playoffs in tee league atm. There is just too much talent. Every team that will make the playoffs either has 2 all-stars or 2 Borderline all-stars. A lot of them have 3 guys of that calibre.  You have to pair with another elite offensive weapon. You could probably go for a lower tier one in someone like Khris Middleton maybe. Or Christian Wood. But really Simmons needs a PNR guard to unlock his true potential imo.
Okay who? Because they tried to get a bunch of Centers and they declined or decided to play for another country. The only one I can think of that would have been a better decision is Christian Wood and it's not known if he agreed to play for them before or after they picked McGee.
"I will agree with the Love over Randle pick being dumb, but they have always given preference to those who played previous and in addition, Randle had backed out on them for the FIBA World Cup previously.   Christian Wood apparently indicated he would come after they picked McGee (that's in contention so who knows the truth)."
We have tons of young players in the nba.   We don have tons of young stars at kd's level or at dray's defensive level.   Are we sure Zion is going to come into the fold? Christian wood?    Don't want to have 2004 situation
"It’s a completely different and not tangentially related scenario BUT Christian Wood was meh all season then Drummond got traded at the deadline, Wood went god mode in the rest of the year, and got 13 a year."
"He has a strong pivot game with will allow him to play centre. He can't shoot well enough to go to the 4. Regardless, he will pair up well with Christian Wood imo"
Christian Wood? Are kidding me?
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
"""The Rockets will spend $36M total on contracts of Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, JaeSean Tate, Kevin Martin Jr, Daniel Theis and David Nwaba. The Lakers are gonna pay Russell Westbrook $44.2M per yr."""
"I'm always happy to see a UNLV player making it in the NBA so between Christian Wood, Khem Birch, and Derrick Jones getting paid the former Rebels are doing pretty well right now (please ignore the Anthony Bennett in the room). Now just gotta get Pat Mccaw signed on to ride the bench for another contender and get himself another ring."
Keep sleeping on Christian Wood casual
Christian Wood.
Gonna negotiate this into Christian Wood!
"PG: Cade; SG: Jalen Green; SF: Jerami Grant, PF: Christian Wood; C: Evan Mobley.  I’d rather get Mobley than SGA.  The drop off from SGA to Jalen Green in terms of offensive production isn’t going to be much, but the increase from Carter to Mobley is probably huge."
Mine would be this with SF and PF being pretty interchangeable. This is just off the top of my head without looking at rosters.  PG: SGA SG: Eric Gordon SF: Johnathan Isaac PF: Jerami Grant C: Christian Wood
he's a plus defender. very good small ball 5. really strange fit next to christian wood though
"Hinkie brought in some gems. Guys like RoCo, McConnell, Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, etc benefited from the Process imo. None of those guys were first rounders yet they all got big contracts."
Christian Wood went undrafted and then passed through four teams before he showed enough in Detroit that Houston were willing to pay him.  I don't know if he sorted his attitude out or suddenly improved. But it's hard to realistically criticise the Pels when so many team missed on him.
Becauee Christian Wood was creating locker room problems
Not only that they had Christian Wood on their team before he got paid and let him go so they could keep Jahlil Okafor. There’s so many little moves that were obvious at the time they were mistakes. Like extending Adams at 17 million before he played a game there. There’s no way he gets that contract or this summer if he was a FA.
"Last off season they could have taken on Al Horford for a pick or signed Christian Wood and either of those guys would have been a better fit beside Zion than Adams or Val.   Griffin didn’t have to extend Adams but that would’ve have been a question to begin with if he didn’t trade for him. Any r/nba nephew could tell you Zion needs to play beside a stretch 5 to maximise his strengths, why can’t Griffin see that?"
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
Who tf is giving Christian Wood a max lmao
"Christian Wood is not a max level player. He’s good at blocks but that isn’t the entirety of defense. He’s also pretty small frame wise for a 5 and gets bodied by the better C’s in the league. I remember the “I want AD game” where even out of shape AD went off on him and won that game easily.  He’s probably worth closer to 20 mill, not 30+. Unless you offer elite production from the 5 (I would say these guys are Jokic, Embiid, KAT, AD, Giannis at times because he can slide over) it’s better to use your max slot on an elite wing or an elite guard because they can defend more positions and run the offense better than a 5 can."
We acting like Christian wood doesn't exist?
"Star - Russell Westbrook - He's in a spot where he can do what he does best, but, without needing to be the first or second scoring option. Lebron tends not to miss when it comes to picking stars as teammates, and, Westbrook has a spirit that won't quit.  Emerging Star - Kevin Porter Jr. - he's got the keys as full time, starting PG for to the Rockets, and is equipped with young talent in Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, along with more seasoned players in Christian Wood and Daniel Theis. He put up a monstrous performance against the reigning champs (resulting in a rare victory  for the Rockets last season), to go along with some moments of promising play before the season's end  Unproven Star - Scottie Barnes - there were many skeptics who voiced their disapproval of the Raptors choosing Scottie Barnes so high, but, he showed out in the Summer League. I think Scottie Barnes may very well end up making an impactful statement for why the Raptors choose him, especially within an organization that has a strong reputation for developing young players"
"Just because Tobias can play the 3 doesn't mean that he should. Christian Wood has no use to the Sixers. A trade that would make neither team particularly happy would be Gordon and Wall for Simmons. Philly gets their win now pieces in the backcourt and Houston gets another rebuilding piece in Simmons. This trade would of course need more pieces to be legal but its the beginning of something, maybe Gordon is routed somewhere else idk"
People really sleep on Christian Wood.  He a 20/10 pf/c.   That's as good as you're gonna get considering the situation.
McCollum the closest star you're gonna get.  If I'm Philly I'm seeing if I can get Christian Wood from Houston.  Wood/Embiid with shooters would be filthy!
Imagine waking up in the middle of the night and seeing Woj tweet  “Philadelphia are finalizing a deal that will send Simmons to Houston for a package headlined by  Kevin Porter Jr and Christian Wood”
Why? I kinda like Eric Gordon and Christian Wood for the 76ers.
"Tilman manadating that Jalen Green/Christian Wood/KPJ package to make the rockets push for the play in game, those playoff revenues are sweet"
18 more and he’s as heavy as Christian Wood
"I think he can definitely contribute to winning, it’s just that it’s not all on the offensive side so it’s not as immediate. He’s definitely a little limited offensively but he’s a solid third option on offense and a very good wing defender, which is better than a decent role player. I do agree that he isn’t and will not be a star but I’d rate him maybe around like the Christian wood tier of player that is overpaid."
"OP is, as Christian Wood would say, a casual"
It’s almost too bad Christian Wood was so good last season. He’d be a shoe-in.
"How I’ve felt with some of the former pistons  Happy for Blake, Reggie, the Morris Twins, Bobi and Tobi, the ghost of Luke Kennard, DRose, along with Bruce Bruce Brown and Christian wood  Except Andre, fuck andre"
"I think they should do it, and throw in Eric Gordon. Or Christian wood"
Christian Wood? Idk

"To the rockets for ben simmons back + christian wood lmao. Rockets are now left without a point guard and go back to kevin porter jr whos their 1st pg right now, its gonna be a long season for houston.   Maybe seth curry can play their point"
I’d still rather have Brook than Christian Wood
"I'd take Nurk over Valanciunas, but gimme Christian Wood over him any day  There's a massive difference in their offensive games. Like even beyond the 3s, Nurkic is a bottom tier finisher, whereas Christian Wood has some of the best touch in the entire league."
Christian wood could develop into anything! He could even become Hakeem!
Christian Wood &gt; Haleem Olajuwan don’t @ me
Christian Wood&gt;Hakeem  Hakeem wouldn't even play in this era. Wood would wax him on the perimeter.smh
This is one of the wildest comments I’ve ever seen on this sub  Those bad teams have no use for all time greats?  You wouldn’t trade Christian Wood for Hakeem right now?  The Bulls wouldn’t trade Zach Lavine for Michael Jordan?
Tough decision between Christian Wood and Hakeem tbh
"CP3, Dwight, Christian Wood were all pretty desired free agents   T-MAC requested a trade here. Carmelo requested a trade to Houston (didn’t go through)  We don’t get FA’s like LA but it’s more than Dallas/SA"
"he averaged the second most points on the team, after Christian wood. You don’t think he helps them win games?"
"Everyone on big contracts, because their poor value contract causes them to get shit on a lot.  1) Ben Simmons  2) John Wall  3) John Collins  4) Kristaps Porzingis  5) Tobias Harris  Other than the contract guys, De’aaron Fox and Christian Wood would(wood) be my takes."
Steph Klay KD Dray Christian Wood
PG Luka (9)  SG Klay (5)  SF KD (10)  PF Draymond (3)  C Christian Wood (3)
"I'd much rather have KP than Wall, contract aside, unless we can get Christian Wood coming back our way, which would require us to send out KP, Powell, plus one of DFS, Kleber, or WCS. Wall's salary is just soooo high."
"I mean let's say by February Beal says he wants out of Washington. Houston can give up their next 3 first rounders+ some interesting young players to Washington, Beal can go to Denver, and MPJ can go to Houston. MPJ, Christian Wood, Jalen Green, and KPJ and not one of them are on a max yet so you can spend money in a decent FA class? Houston would be able to compete as soon as 2023. Again it's a long shot but who knows."
"There are still times where it would make sense to play him. For example, it's hard for the bigs to get good pick-and-roll reps with a bad point guard. Wall could be paired with Sengun and Garuba while Jalen Green could be paired with Christian Wood. If it's a bunch of rookies and 2nd year players out there, that's not a good learning environment."
"What about Wall, one of those unprotected firsts, and Christian Wood?"
"What if the Rockets added Christian Wood? I think Wood is really a 4, and him/Embiid would be a good pairing, theoretically at least."
christian wood &gt; AD
"If I told you we once had a GM who compiled a team of: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Dario Saric, TJ McConnell, Covington, Christian Wood, plus a ton of upcoming firsts and pick swaps, only to be pushed out by Big Collar....."
"very true, although some aren’t even offered a chance to prove themselves in the first place, some not at all and some not as substantially as they deserve, which confuses me. Like for example w/ Justin Patton he definitely seemed like he belongs in my opinion but just never got a chance since he got injured. And then some guys in college ball out n have mad potential but don’t get a chance until later on or not at all. Think Christian Wood, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Ish Smith"

theres people on the rockets sub that think Christian Wood is better than him :|
"If they take that route, look for them to move Christian Wood and Jae'Sean Tate.  The next contracts they will command is going to tie up a lot of space, so the Rockets will want to use all the cap space they can prior to that happening. Plus, they will obviously bring back assets, too (if a prolonged rebuild is the goal).  Otoh, if they keep him around, 2023 represents their one great shot to make a big splash in FA to ""top things off"" like Atlanta did last summer, so taking a bad contract just doesn't work. Additionally, keeping him (and Tate) at age 27-28 would signal they feel they are closer to ""go-time"", since they will be entering their prime and the guards will hopefully be looking nice by year 3&amp;5."
"Because why would you give up the assets it would take to acquire Ben Simmons? Everyone just says ""he'd be a great fit"" next to anyone that can actually shoot, but it's a terrible fit for the other players. A PG who not only can't shoot but categorically refuses to shoot, can't hit free throws, and won't even attempt an open dunk in the playoffs. He also doesn't seem that interested in actually trying to get better.  You know who's a great fit with Green and KPJ? Christian wood, a PF/C who averaged 20/10 on almost 40% from 3. If I'm the rockets I keep him and the picks for a fraction of the cost and keep acquiring cheap young talent in the draft to add to the core."
"Why are they not a Ben Simmons destination? I think he'd be a fantastic fit next to Green and KPJ and that's a great young core.  Would the 76ers be interested in some version of Eric Gordon +/- Christian Wood + picks? Or a three way trade where Wood goes to another team, another solid role player to the 76ers, and picks to the Rockets for Wood?"
Christian 'The Crucifix' Wood tho
"&gt;You're forgetting that the warriors didn't make it last year and are going to take Memphis spot.   Warriors didn’t make it due to the play-in which is a perfect example for why the playoffs are wide open every year now. Whose to say that now they’re guaranteed to make it?   &gt;Also no way in hell the rockets make it   Great argument   &gt;wood isn't an all star caliber player.   Averaged 21/10 this year on 51/37/63 splits, post Drummond trade last season he averaged 23/10 on 56/40/75 spilts. When healthy and in the correct role (like the one he’s in now) Christian Wood has clearly shown he’s an allstar caliber player   &gt;Dudes had like 45 good games over two seasons.  Dude had like 45 games of allstar level play"
"Christian Wood is an allstar caliber player, wall isn’t as bad as ppl act like he is, KPJ is a rising star and they just had one of the best drafts I’ve seen in the last few years (going by how I and others rated them as prospects.)  If Memphis made the playoffs last year I can absolutely see Wall/Green/KPJ/Wood/Theis doing so as well"
Jaylen brown but a realistic option would be Christian wood IMO
"Jerami Grant, RoCo, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, TJ McConnell."
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, two 1sts (top 5 protected) and two seconds"
I mostly agree but I think Green will see most of his minutes at SF.  PG: John Wall  SG: Kevin Porter Jr.  SF: Jalen Green  PF: Christian Wood  C: Daniel Theis
"Dame really just needs to play with a better forward. Honestly, he's never been great off the ball, so rather than having more set up men to get him those looks we need a serious PnR partner and someone who we could run offense through in the front court.     Christian Wood and Dame would be a really business type pair. I hope to see it."
without or with Christian Wood?
"John Wall, Christian Wood and 2 Nets FRP (3rd team for salary matching)  why? draft picks are overvalued and Wood is older than Simmons. Simmons is still a blue chip player and can be an important piece of a contender in 2-3 years when the Rockets prospects are ready"
"What did those players do?  They directly contributed to a team that lost and then jumped ship immediately after lmao.  And Christian Wood is suddenly a big signing?  Dude, you guys won 17 games with him lmao, I wouldn’t be screaming or talking shit to anyone when you’re a fan of the shittiest team in the league.  Why don’t you “keep up” and realize the Rockets are literally the worst team in the NBA right now.  A 2nd pick in a weak draft year won’t change that."
christian wood aight
I'm going to go Christian wood. Had a fantastic stretch or two but small sample size and yet people are acting like he's a star player.
"He averaged .343 on 3.8 attempts his rookie year, .363 on 5.2 attempts his sophomore year, .383 on 7.1 attempts his third year, and then .326 on 6.5 attempts his fourth year.  Decent volume, but not really ""sniper"" percentages at any point.  Eric bledsoe, christian wood, and andrew wiggins each had a higher 3pt % this year than booker."
Homer take: I’d rather have McDaniels and a first than Christian Wood and it’s not close.
"It's also not as hopeless in terms of real contending as people think. If the Pacers can get one draft pick to really hit like Utah did with Mitchell at 12, Denver in the 2nd with Jokic or the Raps at 27 with Siakam, they have Brogdon-Sabonis-Turner to compliment them.   If you can be a perennial playoff team who just needs one out of nowhere hit, I'm not sure it's crazy to not rebuild and just hope that you somehow land one, either via trade (Raptors with Kawhi) or a draft pick or even a Christian Wood type."
"What 3rd team would be willing to part with a good player that (1) helps the Sixers and (2) willingly helps the Wolves land Simmons in exchange for future picks?  I can only see Pistons and Rockets who are clearly hunting for young talent and have good pieces that don't fit their timeline - Christian Woods, Jerami Grant.  Wolves out: McDaniels, Beasley, Prince, 2x 1st round picks.  Wolves in: Ben Simmons  Pistons out: Jerami Grant,  Pistons in: Prince, McDaniels, 1st round pick  OR  Rockets out: Christian Wood,  Rockets in: Prince, McDaniels, 1st round pick  Sixers out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: Jerami Grant/ Christian Wood, Malik Beasley + 1st round pick"
John Wall goes for to the bench or trade him.  Ben Simmons/Eric Gordan/Kevin Porter Jr/Christian Wood/Alperen Şengün  I'm confident that team is playoff contender.
"Also brought in Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, and TJ McConnell  The only pick that is straight bad is Jah and word at the time was Hinkie wanted KP and got over ruled by ownership"
"What do opinions of the trade matter to what Hinkie theoretically would’ve done?  His M.O. the whole time in Philadelphia was increasing optionality in order to land a star player. Giving up a 1st round pick to move up two spots in the lottery is not a Hinkie move.  Also you say he didn’t draft well outside of embiid; TJ McConnell, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, etc. would have to disagree with you"
"&gt;He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington.   How is having these guys on your team for a hot minute and trading them/waiving them before they actually develop supposed to be a point in his favor? I do give him credit for the Covington acquisition/contract (see some of my previous posts) and sure McConnell is a fine player for his pedigree, but the fact the Sixers had every opportunity to cycle through 2nd rounders/UDFAs and give them playing time and only got two players out of it who actually stuck around for the team becoming competitive is exactly why I don't think he's some genius GM like his defenders purport. It'd be a bigger issue if NONE of these guys stuck but the absence of complete failure doesn't automatically make Hinkie good.  I don't see anyone giving the Hornets credit just for taking a flier on Wood because their GM doesn't have a cult of personality around them."
"&gt; It’s only now after they failed you’re calling them bad.  many people in our sub were calling out the tobias trade when it happened. most of us were fooled with the horford signing.  &gt;Same thing once Doc got fired from the clippers y’all were thirsty as fuck  this is a blanket statement. many many many fans were against the rivers signing. including myself.  Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."
"&gt;moves on the margins for anyone  He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington. That's pretty encouraging foresight. He saw that MCW wasn't going to last and shipped out the ROY-winner.  He whiffed on Okafor and Nerlens, but even those are tough because the only legit players who went close behind them were McCollum and Kristaps, who refused to work out with us.  I agree that he had bad relationships with agents, but he seemed to have a solid eye for talent"
Mb. Christian Wood?
Christian Wood? 👀Or better yet.. John Wall
I think it will be Christian Wood.
"People really out here think that LA team isn’t getting run out of the gym by the Balkans. Luka and Jokic playmaking for Giannis and Bogdan. They’re scoring every time down the court. Christian Wood is really supposed to defend Giannis and Jokic?  Good luck. We saw what Luka can do against PG and Kawhi with KP as his running mate, give him Giannis and it’s over."
"The bucks used to be a feeder for the pistons!  Charlie Villanueva, Thon maker, Brandon knight, Jon leur, Brandon Jennings, Christian wood.  I’m missing some more but that’s a pretty decent sized list."
The pistons got rid up all the old bucks crew. Butin 2019-20 their roster consisted of the following former bucks who had been on the bucks roster within the last 2 years:  &amp;#x200B;  Brandon Knight  Tony Snell  John Henson  Thon Maker  Tim Frazier  Christian Wood
"When AD demanded the trade and it seemed like it was going to happen before the deadline, it was tough to watch the Pelicans. I decided I was just going to wait until the trade was made and then start watching again. Then the trade deadline passed and AD was still on the team. Those games were tough to watch. We were starting like 3 guys who aren't in the league anymore at some points. I was able to go to a game toward the end of the season against the Rockets, and AD looked very good for his NBA-forced 21 minutes. Then Christian Wood put up like 30-10. The Pelicans lost by 30. And the highlight of the game was when the stands gave Kenrich Williams a standing ovation for stealing the ball from James Harden at halfcourt.  The team has been pretty fun to watch since then fortunately. Although the next season, Zion and Derrick Favors got hurt and the Pels went on like a 16 game losing streak which was pretty dark too. That season got better though."
Bradley Beal.  Then I would say Christian Wood
Christian wood
Christian Wood
You're right I'm gonna switch BG for Christian Wood
"""The Crucifix"" for Christian Wood always made me chuckle"
"Pels  PG: CP3, Lonzo  SG: Jrue, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield  SF: Trevor Ariza,  Solo Hill....  PF: Anthony Davis, Aminu  C: Demarcus Cousins, Christian Wood  &amp;#x200B;  So probably Thunder."
Jalen Green  Christian Wood  Kevin Porter Jr.  Jae'Sean Tate  Alperen Sengun
Dont know who Christian Wood is
Bucks would be like   Bledsoe   Brogdon   Jabari/tucker or something idk  Tobias Harris   Christian Wood
Rockets??  CP3  Harden  Marcus Morris  Covington  Christian Wood
Greatest: Steve Kerr Best: Christian Wood  Not a great draw
I think he meant Christian Wood and Jalen Green would literally be his legs
"Wall, Harden, DeMarcus Cousins and Christian Wood played together on the Rockets"
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
"Christian Wood will get votes. If the Rockets are anywhere near respectable this year he will be the reason why. Lamelo is probably more likely tho, Hornets are a playoff team imo."
I remember reading something this past season about Christian Wood saying something about sharing the ball more and it was obvious he meant that he wasn't getting enough touches.
Fucking Thunder. They cost me a 10 leg parlay the other night by getting blowed out by Christian “is UNLV D1?” Wood. Then they pull off this miracle. I love the NBA lol
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
"Its more so barnes than us, like it always is more the player than rhe developmebt staff. Look at cam payne before he was about to hit china, same with christian wood, look at whats common between pascal og and fred bur what stanley johnsonn doesnt have, its the players mentality first, llayer development staff second"
"Christian Wood played for 3 teams after us/before Detroit, and didn’t get minutes there either. Jerami Grant actually did get minutes on our team but was extremely young, didn’t play well on OKC until his 3rd season there.   Nerlens Noel got minutes, but we had Jahlil and Joel who were all fighting for minutes at C. that’s on the front office, not Brett.   just admit you don’t know what you’re talking about b"
The sixers also had:  Jerami Grant  Richaun Holmes  Christian Wood  Alex Caruso  Robert Covington  Nerlens Noel
"Yea I agree I think they should semi blow it up. I think they should do a Simmons/Harris for Wall/ Gordon/ Wood and picks. This keeps the sixers competitive. They can run a lineup of Wall-Curry-Green-Wood and Embiid and Eric Gordon would give them great bench scoring. This also frees up long term money with Wall and Gordon both have 1 more year after this season and Wood is a nice young player entering his prime on a great contract. Sixers would go into the summer of 2023 with Embiids contract, Christian Woods cap hold, Korkmaz, and Maxey. I dont think there is any move the Sixers make that will make them contenders outside of getting Lillard."
"18-19 Pelicans weren’t anything close to special. AD carried the offence. Christian wood played 8 games at the end of the season and was cut I don’t know why you’d even bring him up. Mirotic played 32 games that season for us and Randle wasn’t close to the player he is now. AD before he quit had to average 29.3/13.3/4.4 with 1.7 steals, 2 turnovers, and 2.6 blocks just to keep us at 20-21 over those games. In the games he didn’t play cause of injuries we went 4-10.   So even with AD putting up historic numbers we started the season off 24-31. That’s the problem of having a below average team and an awful coach."
"Don’t pretend like Davis had scrub teammates. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Boogie Cousins, Rondo, Mirotic and even a healthy Julius Randle. Yes there were plenty of unlock injuries, but there were also plenty of solid lineups that lacked a true Alpha  Those 18-19 Pelicans could’ve been special if AD didn’t quit halfway through the year. Three guys averaged over 20ppg plus they had Mirotic balling out and even had Christian Wood for a couple weeks"

Christian Wood? Nah.   Jarrett Allen? Yes.
You need to get Christian Wood somehow. He's an effective version of Porzingis. Eric Gordon would be a nice pickup as well.
Jeramie grant better than half these cats. So is Christian Wood.
"Brogdon, Shai, Tobias Harris, Christian Wood, Ayton      Bench: Jamal Murray, McCollum, Mikal Bridges Jerami Grant, Capela"
"Harden definitely deserved out. He gave them his all and after taking the best team ever to a game 7 he was left with John wall, Christian wood and Demarcus cousins no offence but that’s not winning you anything in the nba. They were just getting worse and worse."
Ain't no way Houston trqdes Christian wood.
The Crucifix = Christian Wood

Damn Christian Wood a long boi
"Christian Wood if we wanna embrace the tank later on, he's our best player and could get a healthy return if the FO decides he doesn't fit our timeline (or doesn't wanna pay him down the line)"
"Oh for sure. I’m not saying he would be what he is in Detroit necessarily (but like you said lots of other factors go into getting better regardless) but to say that it was an okay move is wrong I think. Jermai Grant on the Sixers was worlds better than Christian Wood on the Sixers ever was and was already on the edge of being a valuable role player at the point he was traded. He certainly could have provided as much value as a year of Ersan (on a bad team) over his contract and most likely would have developed at least a little more as well.  And I agree that the Sixers do not have the best development coaching but Jerami Grant was a second round pick process Sixer who stuck on the team for two years (a real sign in those days; we were shuffling anyone and everyone around on 10-day contracts so if you stayed that long it meant something) on teams full of other young developing players. The Sixers have certainly not been close to the player development level of the Raptors or anything but during the Process years they did find/develop a number of late round picks or exiled free agents like Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc. It certainly wasn’t unreasonable for late draft pick young players to develop with the Sixers back then"
He might not become this player but he would have been a better young role player to grow with the team than Ersan Ilyasova.   I see your point about Christian Wood because he had more steps in his process before he started truly ascending but Jerami was immediately a nice role player in OKC and then was signed to a bigger contract in Denver where he flourished I don’t think his development was contingent on leaving Philly for whatever reason
"Yeah but idk if Grant would ever become the same player if he stayed. Same for Christian Wood, who Colangelo probably let go"
Christian Wood was right there at the time and the Pacers were trying to trade Myles Turner for the longest
"I don’t understand why the Rockets passed on him. Even with Christian Wood, wouldn’t Mobley would have been a great fit with him?"

"&gt;*his best teammate he ever recieved tore his achilles.*  His second-best teammate was an all-defense, allstar named Jrue.  His second-third best teammates were Boogie/Rondo.  Then there were his other 'bum' teammates Julius Randle and Christian Wood."
"The 10-72 Sixers had Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Robert Covington"
No more Christian Wood slander
Because Christian Wood is the best player on the team and playing him for as many minutes as possible and running the offense through him as much as possible is the best way to actually win games.
Is it just me or is Christian Wood kind of underrated?
I like the idea of a tournament for the number 1 pick. But do you think there's a danger of players not being motivated to win and essentially help their team draft their replacement?   For example would Christian Wood want the Rockets to get the number one pick and draft Chet Holmgren?

Not so much matchups but a team; I’m curious to see the Rockets. My 2K player was drafted to the Rockets and I’ve been having a ball slapping teams around with Christian Wood and that boss Jalen Green.
Christian Wood did not want to be in NOLA..
"For some reason us and Christian Wood didn’t workout, so we let him go. I wanted to keep him, but it is what it is.  And JV is a much player than Horford. Even if you think Horford is a better fit than JV with Zion, I’d still rather have JV because he’s the better player and he’s cheaper.   And not everything is about Zion. Our lineups without Zion are gonna be much better now because of JV. Plus, our backup center can shoot now and can stretch the floor vertically, so it’s not like we can’t create lineups with more spacing if we really needed to."
"Christian Wood isn’t even available and I’m not even sure if he can handle being a full time center, and JV is way better than Horford, and cost way less."
"Not true, you could have easily acquired Horford for next to nothing or a guy like Christian Wood for $13 million a year."
Are we sure about that? Isn’t Christian wood back? Green + Porter JR + Wood + Wall I think will surprise a lot of people this year. Might even be fighting to make the playoffs as an 8th seed… I know it seems like it’s out there but I believe it’s within the realm of possibility if all four are healthy.
"Yeah, at the end of his contract I don't understand why he wouldn't want to team up with MVP Jalen Green, MVP KPJ, and 2 time all star Christian Wood"
I bet they wish they still had Jerami Grant and Christian Wood too
"trade him to Houston for Eric Gordon, Christian Wood and picks"
"Christian Wood and Hassan Whiteside, but he did it year 5."
"Vucevic? Gobert? Lopez? Giannis if you want to call him a center, Sabonis are all easily better. Shit man Christian Wood and Christian Porzingis also have great arguments for being better.  Ayton has an argument for top 15, not really top 10. Certainly not top 5."
"Vucevic? Gobert? Lopez? Giannis if you want to call him a center, Sabonis are all easily better. Shit man Christian Wood and Christian Porzingis also have great arguments for being better."
"They could maybe get a player that has a few more years on their rookie deal.   Like maybe Edwards/LaMelo/Haliburton/Wiseman for Ayton? Although I value Edwars/LaMelo/Haliburton significantly more than Ayton, and I value Wiseman significantly less, so doesn't seem like a clear fit.   Maybe Ayton for Christian Wood?"
"Spurs: Probably  Pistons: Probably  Magic: Just signed a center, have Jonathan Isaac.  Thunder: Overwhelmingly likely eying a center in one of the upcoming drafts, just drafted Giddey, signed Shai to a max. Maxing Shai and Ayton would put them in a very awkward rebuild/compete position suddenly which doesn't really make sense with all the long-term moves they've made.   Hornets: Just drafted a center, already have a lot of money to worry about. Hayward, Rozier, going to have to pay Bridges, Lamelo in a couple years.   Knicks: Probably not. Paid but didn't max Randle, going to have to pay Barrett soon, maxing Ayton would pretty much lock them into a Barrett/Randle/Ayton core, which is pretty bad, especially given the draw of the Knicks.   Rockets: Just drafted Sengun and Garuba, who are both bigs that can't shoot. Traded up for Sengun and you can probably never play him and Ayton together. They also already have Christian Wood.   Kings: Just signed Richaun Holmes, paying De'Aaron Fox, you sign Ayton and then try to trade Holmes for? Fox and Ayton also aren't a great fit because Fox can't shoot.   Wizards: Probably  Blazers: Don't have nearly the cap space and not even going to attempt to clear the cap space for Ayton.   Mavericks: Don't think they have the cap space, and, assuming they haven't completely changed how they want to build their team, they want Luka on the floor with 4 shooters as much as possible. Don't see them spending a max slot on a non-shooter.   Celtics: Literally just paid Robert Williams a very team-friendly contract and not worth fucking our cap for Ayton."
And Christian Wood
"Barnes is probably going to be starting for the raptors for a while though, no? At least until Siakam is back. Sengun is going to be playing behind Christian wood while rockets show him off and try to find a trade partner for him. Sengun will probably start getting the full work load second half of the season."
"Some interesting things in these tweets   On Bey vs Green &gt; Its too early to tell, this is not a knock on S Bey at all but the All Rookie teams historically have been roughly sorted by ""minutes played as a rookie""  What’s the main thing you’ve learnt being inside a team vs outside? Did you underestimate how hard it is? &gt; How Machiavellian and cut throat ppl were while attempting to advance.  On Mavs  &gt; A few ppl in the org enjoyed telling players that I was considering trading them, thinking it would do me harm without really considering the implications it would have on the actual player.   &gt; I was never the GM nor Shadow GM. I never discussed trades with other teams.   &gt; Mavs had a GM and an an owner who generally made the final decision.   &gt; I was just one of many voices albeit at times a very influential one.   &gt; Ones that got away chronologically;  &gt; * Mikal Bridges * Duncan Robinson  * R Covington * Mattise Thybulle * Alex Caruso * Christian Wood * Tyrese Haliburton.   &gt; There were a few that likely would not have worked out too  Q. What do you mean by ones that got away  &gt; Either couldn't pull of a deal - or couldn't convince the powers that be to make the deal."
Simmons for Christian Wood
Christian Wood has been right to say he plays better than most in his position.
"y'all do have Christian Wood at least, so even with inefficient rookies he can lead the team to a very respectable 22 wins"
"&gt; Christian Wood, a 26 year old Forward on his sixth team in six years  It's especially hard to find a place in the league when you go undrafted, especially as a big who didn't play like the centres of the mid 2010's and was considered expendable. He did improve each year, and last year he looked really good. Definitely a guy who would be a really good second or third option.  &gt; now expected to lead the Rockets to the playoffs with a couple of rookies and a second year guy  I don't think anyone expects him to lead a team, especially not this year, but I could see it in 2-3 years if Green, KPJ and Sengun take strides."
"Lmao who would you trade him for instead?? Russell for Wiggins + Kuminga was an absolute steal, I’d rather keep Wiggins than trade for Myles Turner or Christian Wood or some shit"
https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/04/christian-wood-says-he-wants-to-stay-in-houston-for-the-long-term/
"Maybe not the most obvious pick, but Christian Wood.   Rockets will probably struggle a lot early, and with them just drafing Alperen Sengun they may not be commited to Wood longterm"
&gt; is the only sample size we have and so far  No. We have the Turkish league where I believe he played over 30 games. He’s great north-south but laterally he lacks some athleticism. He needs have someone cover for him on defense and Christian Wood can’t do that. Honestly why they drafted Garuba.
"Christian Wood, a 26 year old Forward on his sixth team in six years, months after being let go by the talent-starved Detroit Pistons is now expected to lead the Rockets to the playoffs with a couple of rookies and a second year guy? I can’t see it this year, but it’d be a cool story."
Christian Wood.  No further comment.

Christian Wood if you’re reading this SCREW YOU. I just watched 10 minutes of a Houston Rockets game waiting for you to get a 20/20 game only for you to get 19/19
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
"Mirotic trade and letting Christian Wood walk are the two that come to mind, but both of those were understandable at the time."
"&gt; The hard part was turning all those picks into a winning team.  And this is the biggest thing.   1. In the process of Philadelphia trying to figure out how to win, they've had to tear down a lot of the infrastructure that Hinkie built up.    A lot of Hinkie's players had to be let go because they had no place on the team. We can talk about guys like Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood and Jerami Grant but they had no place to succeed in Philadelphia. They were PF/Cs on a team already overloaded with PF/Cs.   A lot of his coaches, trainers and medical staff also had to be let go.   2. We can't say the problems Post-Hinkie GMs had weren't going to avoided or solved by Hinkie, because Hinkie made very similar mistakes during his time.   Post-Hinkie Problems| Hinkie Problems ---|--- Brand and Colangelo spent all their key draft assets and cap space on non-shooting guards, PFs and Cs| Every single top pick Hinkie had he spent on non-shooting PGs, PFs and Cs The 76ers have had no spacing inside and have had no real answer to the constant double teams| He bragged about forcing double teams in the post and argued the case that drafting 3 consecutive top lottery bigs had put the 76ers in a good position The 76ers have only ever had 1 player who could create off the dribble at an elite level (the #1 skill in the modern NBA) and they lost him| He never once found a player who could create off the dribble at an elite level They've had huge issues with coaching and training staff |  Those staff were all Hinkie hires  Was Hinkie, the man of a million PFs/Cs, really going to save them from overloading on PFs and Cs?   Maybe Hinkie could have saved the franchise, or maybe Hinkie was just another David Griffin, good at running a team into the ground and not much else."
"**Christian Wood** gets hyped a lot on this sub.  Rarely see anything negative about him.  But I haven't watched him enough to form a strong opinion either way.  But I'm just saying he gets a lot of attention.  Knick fans are constantly hyping up **RJ Barrett**, but I think that's only specific to Knicks fans.  It's bordering on hopeful optimism than anything grounded in a realistic projection."
"You keep reciting that mid-season seeding must be considered without actually addressing my argument for WHY it shouldn't. Chanting the same exact thing over and over isn't having a conversation.   Say the Rockets win their first game, should we immediately start talking about Christian Wood as an early MVP candidate or should we recognize that seeding after 1 game doesn't mean anything just like seeding halfway through the season doesn't?"
Christian Wood on Warriors
"Yeah, not that many. Gobert is overpaid and limited in what he can do, Embiid is legit worth every penny (even if always hurt), Jokic is worth every penny, and KAT could be worth every penny if he picked up his defensive game. Are we calling Anthony Davis a center or a powerforward? Either way, there's all the truly elite big men in the game. Are you really going to put someone like Christian Wood into that category? I don't..."

"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
Houston has a solid core - don’t sleep on KPJr + jGreen + Christian wood
"&gt;There are a fucking plethora of guards who can play make decently well.      I don't think this is really true, at least not guards who can playmake well enough to lead a playoff offense.            &gt; There are only a handful of bigs that can punish smaller teams while being a big defensive plus against teams trying to play small ball.      I think this is being a bit generous to Ayton. He punished Batum who many teams would play at the 3. That says a lot more about Gobert than Ayton imo.    That is beyond typical small ball. But could he punish a Draymond or Christian Wood? We have no reason to believe so."
Bruh it is not slander to say CP3 is a way better player than Christian Wood. C'mon.
"Came for Khyri Thomas, staying for Sengun, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, Garuba and KPJ."
Christian Wood an OG if he sticks around for the long haul
"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
"It kinda does mean they are good... you want to rate someone higher than someone else when their skill sets doesn't make people around him better or equate to team success as much as the other   The same people he played with base of your statement James harden made use of. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson,  Austin rivers. Julius Randle left and became an all star as well.   Christian wood was close to winning mip before getting hurt. The warriors weren't even a thing when he was drafted in 2013... So for 7 years the warriors were the problem when he only made the playoffs twice..."
So what you're saying is that Christian Wood is confirmed MVP this year?
Christian Wood and Jokic are the same age
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
"&gt; And yeah, of course you can pair Ben Simmons with no stars, with the ideal 5 like Christian Wood or Chris Boucher, don't pair him with any ball dominant guys or paint cloggers, give him a team of shooters, and that may get you a 25/10/10 Simmons but also a team perpetually a few games out of the playoffs. Simmons is probably a low-ceiling/high floor player that reminds me of Westbrook.  There are enough possessions in a game that it's possible for ben to have a lot of time onball, while still ultimately deferring to an elite offensive option. I think christian wood, ben simmons and a fully realized jalen green could be a great trio.  &gt; I'm really confident it'll have nothing to do with the fit of his team, if it happens it's going to happen from within himself.  I mean I think the fit matters a lot, but at the same time yes there needs to be personal growth, I agree."
"IMO nothing would cure Ben Simmons because he would actually have to execute the gameplan listed here whereas he can't even be made to shoot a 3 a single time. He's just going to play the way he's going to play.  I kind of laugh when I think about the thought of Ben doing better on a different team/lineup. He played with Butler and was useless on offense in the playoffs and there was a line of thinking like 'oh he needs the ball in his hands'. Then they got rid of him and now it's 'oh Embiid is clogging the paint'.  So let's just pair Simmons with a star who isn't a ballhandler/playmaker/paint clogger. The list is literally KAT. That's it. I don't even think Embiid was that bad because Embiid was ultra willing to stand at the 3 point line for Ben.  And yeah, of course you can pair Ben Simmons with no stars, with the ideal 5 like Christian Wood or Chris Boucher, don't pair him with any ball dominant guys or paint cloggers, give him a team of shooters, and that may get you a 25/10/10 Simmons but also a team perpetually a few games out of the playoffs. Simmons is probably a low-ceiling/high floor player that reminds me of Westbrook.  Thing is Ben is 25 so I think he could play better, but I'm really confident it'll have nothing to do with the fit of his team, if it happens it's going to happen from within himself."
Would definitely agree that finding a team for ben can be difficult! I think the wolves are the obvious fit. If mobley can continue to develop his jumper ben would fit very well next to him and garland. Christian Wood is very intriguing as well.
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He’d take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons’ lack of shooting does for Embiid’s spacing, we don’t spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid’s presence takes away all of Ben’s post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he’ll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he’s far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it’s so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid’s presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers’ insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons’ violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn’t shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won’t develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he’s actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn’t an ideal usage of a team’s time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here’s the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it’s only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben’s ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."
"&gt;just look at that insane collection of assets  Adding guys like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel etc is pretty disingenuous since those players realized their full value post hinkie and post sixers.  The criticism I've heard is he did not do anything another person couldn't do...basically saying if the goal is to accumulate assets by being as bad as possible then anyone can do that. Personally I don't think his tenure as GM should be viewed through black and white, good/bad lenses. He did well in some parts (won most of the trades he made) and did poorly in others (failed to build a good team culture, did terribly at the social aspects of the job, mediocre draft record)"
"No the team did not have much talent outside of Embiid. Hinkie could not find any guards and even a lot on OPs list is a bit of a stretch : Okafor and Noel weren’t that good as pros, the second round picks count for nothing, and Christian Wood had a cup of coffee and jumped around the league for years before figuring it out. Even Jerami Grant was a great find as a 2nd rounder but if he’s the second best guy you get in 3 years and have 5 lottery picks, that’s not a good situation to be in."
Weird how both teams somewhat came out of it good unintentionally. May as well call Christian Wood the General as he basically is the reason why Houston got the #2 pick thanks to his injury lmao
Warriors should just trade for Christian Wood
I liked the Christian Wood trade for you guys
"You probably a rockets fan that thinks Christian Wood is better than Looney for the Warriors. You probably need to watch more of what Looney does to realize he's way better defensively and offensively. Warriors don't need their center to shoot, they have Bjelica or even go smaller with Otto Porter."
I don't think there is a rule for a buyout. I think that rule is only applicable if you actually trade the player which the Thunder technically didn't. There isn't much precedent for it either. Only thing that comes to mind is the Christian Wood-Tim Frazier indecisiveness the Pels and Bucks had a couple years ago.
"Willie Cauley Stein became our starting center... He was cut by the 20 win Warriors. Our center rotation is legitmately one of the worst I have ever seen.   Houston and Orlando can barely win games but they still have Wendell Carter, Mo Bamba or Christian Wood, Sengun, and Daniel Theis, all who are infinitely infinitely better than Powell, WCS, and Moses Brown. Boban is effective in very specific situations that come about like once every 10 games.   That being said, I think Dorian Finney-Smith definitely gets minutes off the bench for the Suns and Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup point guards in the league. Issue is Brunson is straight up our number 3 option and third best player and Finney Smith is our main perimeter and wing defender, and honestly one our more important shooters with how bad Hardaway/Bullock have been.   Hardaway and Bullock need to get it going so our shooting can at least start to cover deficiencies some games. I think both are capable of being very solid players as we saw from both of them last season."
"I feel Houston is winning too many games. Like, yesterday right after they won, Christian Wood trade rumors started. I think they are just raising value to get something and moving on. They aren't trying to win now. They got a young team and need minutes for the young guns. Guys like KJ and JayGup.   Btw. Had JayGup played at all this season? How's he looked?"
"And at...what's the number? 17 million this year and 18 next year?  NOP actually traded something to acquire him, and then extended him...  When they could have just signed Christian Wood for less money."
"Yeah I'm not sure what the point of this trade would be. The Warriors are at the top of the league and still without a couple guys. There's zero reason to trade young pieces + depth and picks for a guy like Christian Wood when you're already a favorite to win as is lol. Don't get me wrong, he's a nice player, but the Warriors don't need him at all and honestly he could bring back some shades of Oubre's time there as Wood is kind of a similar black hole offensively"
"And a bench of McConnell, Shamet, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood"
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
How's Christian Wood on defense? Kuminga is looking to be a defensive stud.
Are you saying Looney is better than Christian Wood? Because that's just not true at all
"Now watch them win the Christian Wood sweepstakes lol  And btw, i find it funny that you have a new whipping  boy in DJ after murdering Scott Brooks last season lmao. Keep em coming, OP!"

"Christian Wood grossly underrated. People were actually saying he's mediocre earlier in the season, unreal."
i don't think Charlotte should hesitate in parting with either of those players if it gets them Christian Wood. PJ Washington will have a nice career though
"&gt; I'd ask you for a source on every rocket fan wanting to trade him,  Go check out the Rockets sub and the many fuck Christian Wood threads."
I quite literally watched Wood put up 4 points against the Warriors while getting clamped by Steph of all people.  He was sleep walking through that entire game.  That's who Christian Wood is.  There's a reason why every Rockets fan is trying to deal his ass.
Ayton’s a restricted free agent so I view it differently  I’m just saying Christian Wood’s trade value isn’t as high as Ayton or Bridges. Rockets might be able to get Wiseman from GSW for Wood because he had a bad rookie year and they’re tryna win now and Wiseman doesn’t help that as much as Ayton or Bridges do
"He’s not tho, Christian wood is better rn, wall was shit last year"
John Collins and Christian Wood
"Probably not a good fit with Ayton.  I'd try to see if I can get some picks from Charlotte if I were the Rockets. Or maybe wait to see how Wiseman does when he returns back to the Warriors. If he looks bad, maybe see if they're interested in Christian Wood."
Christian Wood took your girl when he was in Milwaukee or something?  The hate is so random/specific. Dude is a good player
"If Christian Wood we’re as good as Christian Woods fans think he was, the Rockets wouldn’t have just 3 wins"
Christian Wood might work as a replacement for Frank Kaminsky as a 3rd backup center.
Yes Christian Wood is an amazing player who is worth the many assets cause he will be great on your team
Christian Wood is the epitome of an empty stats guy.  He’s never going to help a winning team.  His defense has never been good
"I still feel like they should try to upgrade from Crowder by going after maybe Harrison Barnes (kings prob won’t trade him), Jerami Grant, or Christian Wood (idk if he’d fit next to Ayton)  What do y’all think?"
"Not an all star, but Christian Wood"
"Looks like Christian Wood got the memo- when our (bad) starting center is out, you're supposed to feast.  KAT's slow fat ass couldn't manage that the night before."

“Fuck Daniel Theis” — Christian Wood
"Tbf I haven't watched any Rockets ball because why would I want to do that this year but based on their roster and what NBA media guys like KOC and Lowe have said, there's no way for guys like Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., and Christian Wood to learn how to play winning NBA basketball when DJ Augustin is the only veteran pg playing"
Christian Wood
"I mean, they can swap him just to balance the roster out, but in my vision, you have to trade Nurk too  like CJ for Christian Wood or Brandon Ingram type deal and then Nurk to a big deprived team like Toronto, Sacramento, Dallas, San Antonio, Nets to fill in the gaps"
As a spurs fan we try for a big name then if we can get a smaller man in market like a Christian wood kinda person then we resign Murray trade derrick white and start Lonnie and let primo get minutes our worst scenerio is we don't get a free agent Murray walks and we can't find a trade piece for white or Thad young we package the two together with maybe mcdourmet and a pick or two for a Lavine or klay kinda sg so primo could play the one
Christian Wood  Jae’Sean Tate  Eric Gordon  Kevin Porter Jr  Jaylen Green  **Checkmate**
"There’s 3 notable ones but pretty much everyone on our team has been a bit disliked at one point or another.  Daniel House Jr - Up until about 3 days ago, this was the definitive answer. Not a single person was happy when Mickey Mouse D House was on the floor. Started before the season when he wouldn’t give Jalen number 4 (Some petty bullshit that no one should’ve cared about). Then he came out and gave us all a reason to be angry. He sucked, every game. But Silas kept playing him over giving minutes to some of the young guys. It got to the point where if you saw him taking a mid range jumper, you essentially knew he was gonna miss. Then last game he was on fire and basically won us the game (with Garrison Matthews). So at this point I don’t even know what to think.  Daniel Theis - He’s not a bad player, just an awful fit with our offense. I think people are more angry at Silas for giving Theis 30 minutes over actually being mad at Theis. It’s pretty obvious how much better the offense is when him and Wood aren’t on the floor together and Sengun is out there.  Christian Wood - He’s probably our best player, but he’s not having a great year. He complained in a post game interview that he “wasn’t involved enough in the offense”. If I remember correctly the next game he came out and gave 0 effort and barely took any shots. He ended with like 4 points and 1 rebound. Woods also sold us in key moments of games by thinking he’s a PG and carrying the ball down the floor only to lose it. I think a lot of Woods underperforming can be attributed to the awful spacing with Theis and the wacko rotations by Silas. He looks miles better when playing with Sengun. Regardless he’s got some major flaws that need to be cleaned up."
Christian wood
"Bad results doesnt mean lack of effort.  I feel like lack of effort is used as an excuse for just missing your shots ""he wanted it more"" is a sham of a saying imo.  I am a warriors fan but ive watched many teams this season (because i am a basketball junkie) and you cant tell me the Rockets/Timberwolves/Pistons/Spurs etc dont play hard top class basketball.  I love seeing the elite ball movement on the young spurs, the push and pull of jalen green and christian wood play styles, the assortment of talented players on the Pistons, and the all stars on Twolves trying to redeem themselves."

You got 2-3 legitimately great NBA prospects. Elite athletes. Another really good young player in Christian Wood. And a player who has had stretches of being a borderline all-star and elite 6th man on championship contenders in EG. You guys really shouldn't be THIS bad
"Here are some of the Sixers process era players that weren't considered NBA players (by a long shot, in some cases) at the time..  * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Jerami Grant * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * Ish Smith  All of these guys went from being essentially G-Leaguers to contributing players.  Brett Brown isn't the guy that's going to lead you to a championship, but he's one of the best at getting lower tier players to improve and play hard.  I'd argue that due to his unique experience coaching one of the worst teams of all time, he's one of the most qualified of this particular situation."
"I just revisited the 10-win sixers’ 2015-16 roster and at this point it’s almost difficult to tell how bad their roster really was if you weren’t around to see it. Cause a lot of those players went on to be much better  Cov, Jerami, Richaun, TJ, and Christian Wood are all semi-solid NBA players now, and Elton Brand was good before those years. But that year was unbelievably devoid of on-court talent"
"Seriously. Green isn't going to develop by being an inefficient chucker and turning the ball over. He'll just be learning bad habits. The rockets would benefit if they actually tried to play basketball while playing their young guys. Plus, KPJ is absolutely not a PG and never will be. Wtf rockets they could be an exciting team to follow right now, but the product is atrocious. I get that they're trying to lose, but cmon this is too much. They have no veteran role models. Who are they going to look up to? Wall sitting on the bench in street clothes collecting pay checks? The ghost of Christian Wood? It's frustrating as hell even as a Lakers fan"
"&gt; Why not play Wall? It’s simple, really: Houston has no interest in winning. The Rockets are in the early stages of a full rebuild. James Harden is gone, and with him went any hope of contending. Instead, Houston has gone full Process, committing heavy minutes to Porter, Green and Christian Wood while holding Wall out.   This doesn't make sense as an explanation for why Wall isn't playing at all. Houston is giving minutes to non-rebuild guys like Gordon, Theis, and Augustin.   The only thing that makes sense to me is that they told Wall he'd have to be a reserve off the bench behind KPJ and Green, and Wall said he'd rather not play at all."
Christian Wood maybe???
"Cause their team is terrible. Their best players is a rookie.  Next player is an above average rotation player in Christian wood.  Then old Eric Gordon.  They have a talent problem.  Three guys worth a damn and the rest suck.  Kind of hard to develop a winning culture.   The last guy to blame is the Coach.  Maybe the GM, maybe Ownership, the players, the lack of solid G league Players to pull from. Also do the rockets GM and Ownership want them to be good? Especially since only two guys will be on the roster in two years."
"he might be a bad coach but i feel like their roster is the reason for their horrific start   their 5 leading minutes guys are Christian Wood, Jalen Green, KPJ, Eric Gordon and Jae’sean tate. in what world was that team ever going to be competitive lol  maybe a better coach is like 3-14? maybe?? idk lol   again i’m not against firing him if they think he sucks. it’s just that roster is fuckin terrible"
It feels like they aren’t.. whenever I check the scores they are getting blown out. Their young studs always seem to be having low scoring inefficient games too. They are too talented to be *this* bad. I blame Christian Wood
I know we’re a long ways away from this but can you imagine if Green doesn’t pan out perfectly and Mobley becomes a perennial All-NBA/DPOY candidate? They would’ve essentially missed out on him because they already had Christian Wood lol

"They lost by 18 to the Celtics BTW.  I definitely don’t watch rockets games, but their team consists of rookies or 2nd year players as the majority of their lineup, their best player (from an outside view) is Christian Wood. They’re sitting John wall and just embracing the tank."
We don’t have much but… 1. Alperen Sengun 2. Jalen Green 3. Kevin Porter Jr. 4. Christian Wood 5. Josh Christopher 6. Usman Garuba 7. Kenyon Martin Jr. 8. Jae’sean Tate
Seems like a lot of moves to make just to end up taking a step back over Christian Wood
Definitely gotta rebuild around franchise cornerstone Christian Wood
Do you think they rebuild around Christian Wood or trade him for picks
Noted perimeter defender Christian Wood
Busting out the bag vs Christian Wood is like Goku going SS2 against Krillin.
Christian Wood is the ghetto Christian Wood
He’d be the ghetto Christian Wood    I can’t justify or explain why but it just makes sense
"Man, he was a sort of proto-Christian Wood/Evan Mobley type. I think he'd be fucking great (he was fucking great!)."
"No every Rockets fan has already turned on him lmao he's giving Theis minutes over Sengün and taking Jalen out for important stretches. He lets Christian Wood play selfishly and isn't prioritizing the development for our rookies, which is the most important thing for a rebuilding team."

&gt; a starting-quality center.  Not that I'm making an overall judgement on Christian Wood here but dude just straight-up fell over trying to inbound the ball
Jalen Green is the worst starter in the league right now.  You trading him for Christian Wood?
Last year some guy in the rockets sub made a post saying christian wood was the best signing the franchise had ever made and harden was crazy to want out because we were contenders.
Christian Wood isn’t even a real center
"Please Mitch for the love of god trade for Christian Wood or someone, we need a real fucking center.   On the bright side though, Miles was abusing anyone not named Capela tonight, and despite having a rough time scoring, LaMelo had 12 assists with only 2 turnovers and 10 boards."
"lmao even that can’t save them. For some reason him and ad and the fo thought westbrook and some old vets were better than younger hungrier defensive pieces. Could have traded for 3&amp;D Wings and a shooter. Shit if i was them id trade whatever i could for Eric Gordon and Christian Wood. Lakers suck on DEF so might as well have offense. 26-30 is open for LA if they wanna take on one of Wall or Gordon/Wood. Wood provides a backup for AD as well as scoring if he has LeBron/Russ running PnR, and then you got a veteran elite shooter in Gordon"
"Enjoy adding the white version of Christian Wood, Chet Holmgren, as your reward for this tank. You’ll be even better at tanking then!"
Is tanking a sin? No because it’s some a Christian Wood do.
Christian Wood is evil Bill Russell
That Christian Wood out of bounds turnover is one of the most elite tank moves I've seen in years.
Christian Wood
Christian Wood does not seem to be as good as he thinks he is
"I swear Christian Wood purposively turns it over sometimes, there's no other explanation for how inaccurate some of his passes are"
"Sengun is miles better on defense than Christian Wood or KPJ. I mean, he actually tries."
"Nothing sneaky about how bad he’s been so far this season. I’d elect Christian Wood for the sneaky bad player from our team this year. 16/11 doesn’t look bad on the surface, but he’s a center who’s TS is almost 4 percent below average. Then you have to talk about how terrible he’s been defensively."
Would you guys maybe be interested in trade revolving around PJ Washington + filler and Christian Wood?
Christian Wood is absolutely better than him
Christian Wood is their best player
"Christian Wood, Jeremi Grant, FVV, Dinwiddie, Harrison Barnes, Valanciunas"
"Any combo of Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Christian Wood, Daniel Theis and probably 2-3 picks."
Tank Commander Mt Rushmore inductee Christian Wood
Christian Wood seems like he’d be good for missionary
For real. Christian Wood would’ve easily been the second best player on some of those Cavs teams he drug to the finals
Tank commander Christian Wood
Christian Wood is a 50% FT shooter and that's much better to watch than Plumlee from the stripe
Christian Wood 😍😍😘🥰😜
"I agree with the sentiment, but trading away 3 lottery picks right after drafting them with one at his lowest value for Christian Wood of all people is absolutely not worth it. If there was a deal on the table that would put us over the top I wholeheartedly agree."
At least Hassan Whiteside was a big time shot blocker. Christian wood is not that.
Yeah you're crazy to think a team is giving up two lottery picks for Christian Wood.
"I'm genuinely baffled this conversation is still going.   Wood isn't an All Star or even close to it. He can put up 16 and 11, he's still a mid tier player who is not gonna draw crowds. I can guarantee you, people don't consider the chance to watch Christian Wood put up numbers in another L as entertainment. He's not gonna move the needle whatsoever to basketball fans. Hell if anything I know a few of my friends would've paid to go watch John Wall even though he's trash now.   Most fans still going to watch Rockets games are probably there to watch the opposing team at this point."
"Well he was literally 19 during those 33 games and thrown into the most complex system in the league after 2 practices. (Literally two because he got symptomatic covid) And then had to get conditioning back after that while playing in games. I honestly don’t know what you wanted from him but to call him a bust after that is crazy to me.   Bob Myers and Joe Lacob already confirmed our direction, which is compete now and plan for the future so I don’t see any reason for those three to be traded. And Christian wood is not a guy that moves the needle for a championship team in my opinion anyway."
"Uhhh, first of all wiseman has played 33 games, didn’t get to have a preseason, training camp or summer league. Didn’t get to play college ball either. So qualifying him as a bust is asinine and short term thinking.   Secondly, Kuminga already plays in our rotation, the deepest rotation in the league this year. He’s proven himself to be a good defender and capable of finishing at the rim. He’s not a “meh” prospect either, he went 7th in a very deep draft.  Finally, Moody is a good prospect, no one projected him out of the lottery, most had him exactly where we got him and he fits our system extremely well. Christian Wood is a below average defender and has had character concerns since college, he’s not nearly worth 3 good prospects."
"If your goal is to sell tickets, Christian Wood is not the guy who's gonna help you do that lmaooo"

No it’s Christian wood and it’s not close
How can you cover the sport as your job and not know Christian Wood lmao
"Not even close when you have players like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant and Colin Sexton. Maybe even Malik Beasley"
I mean it’s Christian Wood’s award unless he gets hurt. Although I agree that Boucher is at least in the discussion for who is behind Wood.
"Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges are more impressive IMO, but Boucher def deserve some cred"
I believe Christian wood should win it. Man putting up numbers 🔥
"damn, on the same day christian wood calls him out for being a casual"
Shaq taking some fat L's tonight between that and Christian Wood calling him a casual on national television
Best part was Christian Wood calling Shaq a casual
Yeah Shaq is so out of touch smh. Christian wood is out here balling tf out.
"Eh, I didn't watch a single Pistons game last season but I heard plenty on this sub about how this ""Christian Wood"" fella was the real deal, and that one guy who does the 99¢ bin posts had Wood as one of the best players a team could get on the cheap  That's not to say that people who hadn't heard of him are casuals, but he was far from a nobody last year"
"Who are we kidding, Christian Wood was a nobody last year. This year he is performing given the opportunity, now people are getting to know his name."
"everybody in here complaining about the owner cutting corners yet looking at this rockets roster and its not like harden has nobody to play with, this christian wood guy is averaging 20-10 and pair him with john wall in the back court and they could have been an actual formidable team."
Christian “Yamato” Wood
"You get future picks giving more assets to trade/hope you get lottery picks in the future and save cap space while building a core that is attractive to FA’s. It’s the same playbook the clippers and the nets went with (but more draft capital). Rockets believe they have some talent in Christian Wood, Jaesean Tate and hope to build on that but not just overpay a star because cap space is available."
"This, Tate made layup after layup after layup of LA I’m the 4th not to mention we couldn’t defend the 3 pt line at all this game, we lost to Christian wood and the rockets bench and it was embarrassing from start to finish. Also I don’t know why Demar is our de facto last shot taker even in games where he’s played like hot garbage"
I want a new Shaq-Christian Wood many year rivalry
"If shaq ever has to do a round of Who He Play For, christian wood is def gonna be #1 after this"
"And he score those 23 and 18 points when the game was already over down 25+. I like Christian wood, but people really tried to compare him to AD and got his ass put in the 7th circle of hell."
" Crazy that there are so many fans out there that are total die hards for the nba and basketball, and we are stuck with these dum dumps who probably couldn’t even name all 30 teams, or even 30 players.   Most hardcore fans knew Christian wood from before the draft when he went Undrafted."
Totally fair. Sterling brown is a solid defender but that's about it. And it's sad they had to put KJ on christian wood late to slow him down. :(
Nba just too scared to let a man named christian wood be the face of the league smfh my head
"All Star, Christian Wood"
He's no christian wood
i love christian wood
Christian Wood to r/nba.
I think this is the first time I’ve seen Christian Wood in an interview and he seems like a very chill dude. Hope he keeps ballin tf out
I will die for our new savior Christian Wood. We are in the WoodWall Dipo era boys.
Christian Wood called Shaq a casual fan lmfao
"Tillman is beside himself, begging Stephen Silas (thru texts) to bench Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown next game."
"Nah bro, get Christian Wood some help! Trade a couple picks for a veteran guard and big man. Something like this maybe:  John Wall/George Hill/Christian Wood/PJ Tucker/Al Horford  Man that gets y’all in the playoffs for sure!!"
Christian “Shaq the Casual” Wood
i am ready to die for christian wood
Christian Wood.
"We gotta win those. KJ showed out for us, but Christian Wood is special. GG."
"Brooklyn who? The real super team is Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown."
"I AM ALL IN ON THE CHRISTIAN WOOD, JOHN WALL, DEMARCUS COUSINS, STERLING BROWN, JAE'SHAUN TATE ROCKETS  EWING THEORY SZN"
Christian Wood. What a steal the Rockets got on that contract.
"Brooklyn who? The real Big 3 is Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown."
christian wood he’s been carrying houston as of late
Imagine if we gave Christian Wood the bag this past offseason
"Christian Wood killed us in a game when he was still on Detroit, and he's killing us again tn."
"Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown are gonna be held out next game for sore elbows."
Christian wood
"I disagree, he wants and deserves to play with another elite player. Christian Wood and John Wall weren't gonna ever give him inspiration to ball to what he's capable of."
its a badge of honor. christian wood got his attention enough to pretend not to know his name
professional basketball analyst just found out about christian wood tonight. alright then.
"Chuck: [Christian Wood] is a hell of a player, he was just stuck in Detroit.   lmfao"
Christian wood!
Christian Wood gets my Wood up.
Christian Wood &amp; Co.
"Tf does that even mean? Christian Wood didn’t want 8m, he wanted more. Thus why he didn’t sign with the Pistons."
Going to be a real test for Christian Wood to get his without a ball handler
"&gt;”no young high upside players”  2 words: Christian Wood  Also the team looks fine on paper, and could definitely still make a 7 or 8 seed.  The goal right now could be to be a hybrid of OKC and pre-Kawhi Clippers, where Houston has a ton of picks, while still being a scrappy playoff team, all while having a max contract slot open for a new star to come in (one that’d be better than Simmons)  Hell, if we’re gonna play the “what if” game, then what if Houston did get Simmons and his game still doesn’t improve yet still demands a trade 3-4 years down the line and Houston can’t get anything more than a couple late firsts for Simmons and then Wood walks in FA all because we locked into fool’s gold with Simmons?  Overall it’s just better to evaluate more on the long term than on the short term anyway"
Christian Wood IS average. I don’t get the hype. Also don’t get people that said he was better than Covington or Jerami Grant lmao when it’s just simply wrong.
Sterling Brown and Christian Wood going to be their Point Guards tonight? lol
Completely agree. He could even spend time at the 4 and run a line up with him and boogie. Christian wood is quick enough to cover the 3. And do Eric Gordon and John Wall
"Can we call it a solid duo or Christian Wood and Dipo pls?? Bc they’re their 2 best players, throw in Wall and you have an Eastern playoff team"
"That's good for them though, once Harden has been traded its not like Houston is going to think about competing this year or next, they are basically going to ""reload"" a bit here.  Finish this season off could maybe make the playoffs (would be better if they didn't though, which is why I do think they will trade Oladipo, PJ Tucker, probably everyone on the table beside Christian Wood (will probably be impossible to move John Wall)).   See where FA and draft go, start rebuilding and finding a new core."
"&gt;They rerouted for Jarrett Allen who was an upcoming RFA for a 1st round pick right after they just signed Christian Wood to be their future starting C, so while I agree it was bad value, Allen wasn't going to be starting there anyway  it doesn't matter whether Wood is there or whether Allen would be starting -  it's still terrible value. even in a sign-and-trade scenario next summer you should net more than a '22 Bucks pick for Allen.   Prince isn't good but he'll be an expiring mid-tier contract next summer, his contract alone is valuable for salary matching purposes. a competing team could be very interested in him this summer in a salary dump situation, similar to the Horford/Danny Green deal, or for the purpose of consolidating smaller contracts into 1 medium contract - because he would make it easier to trade for a high salary guy at the next trade deadline.  if that trade happened in a vacuum people would be losing their minds."
&gt;Their broke ass owner means they can’t take anything other than expirings.   I guess that's why they traded for Christian Wood right.
"&gt;other than the fact that they just re-routed every player with multiple years on their deal to an other team for pennies on the dollar  They rerouted for Jarrett Allen who was an upcoming RFA for a 1st round pick right after they just signed Christian Wood to be their future starting C, so while I agree it was a bad value trade, Allen wasn't going to be starting there anyway.  The only other move was Levert for Oladipo which could be looked as a shrew move taking advantage of the Pacers' consistently valuing the long-term asset in Oladipo negotiations as a Presti-like move to flip later on to a team the Pacers wouldn't trade to (due to potentially being the Pacers playoff matchup) - like the Sixers or Heat.  See, its easy to spin the narrative to how you want it."
"&gt; They can - there's nothing that says Houston needs to only take expiring money.  Their broke ass owner means they can’t take anything other than expirings. John wall, Christian wood, daneul house, and Eric Gordon alone costs them over 80 mil. They need to sign 10 more players to have a full roster next season. They can’t afford 20 million to Gary Harris.  &gt; He's been a 20 ppg scorer this year so far, even if his defense has fallen off, teams have traded late 1sts for less.  The Celtics don’t even need another guard. You gonna start him over Kemba, brown, or smart in the playoffs? Hell no. Philly trade you mentioned seems somewhat possible. Would be a bad idea for Philly unless they’re  convinced dipo will win them a chip this season, which I’m not."
Wasn't Christian Wood a free agent signing (on a ridiculously cheap contract)?
"I mean imagine a small market team performing poorly - they don’t get free agents anyways, and now they don’t even have draft picks to pick up so they either have to a) overpay rookies, taking a huge gamble, or b) lose out on rookies entirely and wallow in mediocrity until they find their FVV/Duncan Robinson/Christian Wood, and then be forced to trade that player to a contender anyways. No draft is legit a terrible take for parity in the league. That’s not even mentioning the lack of trading power teams in general will have if there are no draft picks to swap."
Wasnt it Christian Wood?
"Can't really say because he never bought in. I lean towards the latter though. If he buys in I think they're better than their team last year. I think Wall will be a better fit than WB and Christian wood has looked great. Wood and Harden would've been a lethal PR combo, like harden and capela on roids"
"Then they trade john wall, oladipo and cousins. Build around christian wood?"
Christian wood seems like the real deal too
"yeah thats fair. Im not sure any of John Wall, Eric Gordon or Oladipo are on this team next year. Christian Wood is a future staple though, hopefully."
Christian wood circled that date as soon as he heard about that trade
I'd rather have Christian Wood on a contending team tbh. Especially one that needs a big and another scoring option.
Oladipo is AD lite. I just can't believe the man would omit Christian Wood like that
"Oladipo is expiring and Christian Wood was a free agent, Roco really just opened up the cap room to sign him."
And Christian Wood??
Christian Wood will likely end up being the best asset on that list
You can't play Allen with Christian Wood.  I don't understand why they didn't just keep LeVert tho
Christian Wood
"Nah he put up similar numbers the past 2 years, it would be hard to win it over Christian Wood right now"
"Two teams that are equally good in different season, or even in different conference (even in different divisions) won't end up necessarily end up with the same record.   Your record and seeding is about who you are competing against.   The Rockets were a 50-win team last year based on their winning percentage.   A team with John Wall, Christian Wood (playing like he's played), Oladipa and a moderately healthy DMC can win 50 games depending on their level of competition.   The fact that they are off to a slow start is demonstrative of Harden's refusal to actually try (look at his percentage and scoring out put over the last five games, which are his lowest in over FIVE years).  Before those five games they were .500 and they even managed to win one of those games.   But last year's Rockets were playing against a weaker Western conference, so that same roster would likely win fewer games this year (Phoenix, LAL, NO, Sac-Town, Denver, and Dallas are all better, while Utah, Portland, and the Clippers are just as good).   It's a 'what if' sure, but the current Rockets roster has as much talent from 1-15 as last year's team, even if last year's team had better talent up at the top."
"This ignores what each of those things cost- the picks+ Paul for WB (Paul ended up being 2nd team all NBA), the picks and players for RoCo (idr who).    I think the overall movement is mediocre.  Until any of these picks turns into a good spot, the only highly encouraging thing is Christian Wood"
"The Houston Rockets turned James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Covington into Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Christian Wood 7 first round picks and 4 pick swaps"
"That is true; Christian Wood is young enough tp ,are it to the otherside of a rebuild."
"Sounds like a lot of picks, but majority of those picks from BRK will be complete ass. Christian Wood is like the only good thing they got lmao."
"&gt; Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I mean, most of those players shoot well below league average on 3's, a few &lt; 30%. I would argue there's only a few true stretch 5's   &gt;  Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP  On that list, 40% play the 4 more than the 5. That's my point, we are seeing more an evolution of the 4 than we are of the 5. Your center is still most likely the bruiser inside rim protector they have always been."
Christian Wood upcoming all star
"even with dipo i still dont get this haul for houston. youre better off trading for simmons, maxey and maybe one other rotation piece + 1 or 2 picks.  simmons, maxey and christian wood is a fun team to build around"
"I’m sorry but Harden still has a lot of contribution left in him. Westbrook the same but a little less. I’ll give you Christian Wood, but Vic won’t be anything more than a solid starter, I would imagine similar for Wall, who will be really old when those draft picks blossom."
"Yeah this comment makes opposite sense. This rockets front office has absolutely killed it during their 3-months or so tenure. Turned a disgruntled duo in Russ and harden in to John Wall, Dipo and basically 8 first rounders (5 frps + 3 pick swaps). Also added Christian wood for cheap. Jheez"
"Jaylen Brown, Christian Wood, Domantas Sabonis, Marcus Smart, idk, dozens of other contracts."
"john wall is 10x better than westbrook, they got a real center, and they got christian wood but apparently none of that matters at all like what are you smoking"
They have Christian wood
the rockets should have gotten jarrett allen man. idc if christian wood is there or not. they fucked up there. cavs got an absolute steal
Christian Wood better than Harden anyway
You are crazy to think this.  Boogie is old injuries have killed him. He can’t stay on the court without fouling out.  John wall is a lateral move from Westbrook and Christian wood is still coming into. His own.  Not to mention they have a rookie coach and crappy role players
"You are right that most are there for their defense/rebounding like Gobert, WCS, Biyombo, Drummond, Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Capela, Adams, etc.  But there are also many that can spread the floor (some much better than others) like Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I think it depends on the team's playstyle because sometimes the 4 is more defensively oriented and/or the 5 is more for spacing. Many of the best centers can shoot pretty well like Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP, if they're playing the 5. Also, Vucevic? I know the drop off is steep from the top 3/5 but I think he's pretty comfortably like 6 or 7th."
"It makes perfect sense, you go from having a super controversial maligned star who played a polarizing style of basketball, to having 3 former stars who have been unfortunately humbled by injuries all having a feel good season, healthy for the first time in years and playing good basketball. People love Wall and Oladipo and I personally have always been a big fan of Cousins. Throw Christian Wood in the mix and that’s a super fun team"
"The backlash has grown a lot recently with Shaq's recent ridiculous comments on Christian Wood, Rudy Gobert, and Donovan Mitchell, but yes there's a minority of us that dislike how low-level their commentary is and how they are *legitimately clueless about and apathetic at best towards* the modern NBA."

Change Dwayne Bacon to Christian Wood
Christian Wood
Wall and Dipo need to get better at feeding Wood and using the PNR.   James with Him in the PnR had Christian running circles around Nurk in the first match uo
"Technically, the final 2 spots can be backcourt or frontcourt so it wouldn't be Christian Wood competing against just bigs. So he's in a group competing for the final 2 slots  Backcourt: 4 guaranteed spots  Frontcourt: 6 guaranteed spots (LeBron, AD, Kawhi, PG, Jokic, Gobert)  Final 2: Any position"
Christian Wood: + 3.1 Overall DEF Raptor  Zion Williamson:  - 2.2 Overall DEF Raptor   One of these is added value on both sides of the court.
I’m not even a Russ hater it’s just this guy was making some random comments about Russ being clutch and Dame not on my post lmao   And on a Christian Wood post. Like wtf does Russ have to do anything with that 😂
"It should be Christian Wood, the all star of my heart"
Giannis wishes he could shoot like Christian Wood
Christian Wood
Christian Wood over Zion.
He may be a Christian but he's got my Wood hard
AD is Christian Wood-lite
Christian Wood has scored less than 20 points ONCE this season in THIRTEEN GAMES.
Christian Wood is a fucking G BABY
Is Christian Wood the GOAT?  Think about it
Christian WOOD IS THE GREATEST PLAYER IF ALL TIME
Christian Wood #NBAVOTE
"Not a Rockets fan, but Christian Wood deserves an all-star spot over Zion. He is putting up better numbers. Underrated"
Christian Wood is a monster. Gets the steal and takes it all the way to the cup for a dunk.
"this houston team is so rough, boogie wall and oladipo just jack shit lol. christian wood is gonna pissed soon, i guarantee it."
"I’m going to be Perfectly honest with you . Pascal Siakim isn’t a second option while a good player in his own right ,he can’t be the man of this franchise . Second , Fred VanVleet is an okay shooting guard or an all-star level shooting guard  , let’s be honest he’s a all star at this point , but won’t carry team to the finals via physical limitation, he’s too short . OG is the one guy with the most upside so he’s a player U want to bet on in the playoffs  . Moreover , why I’m assessing these players , I believe Toronto needs to make a trade and if the FO isn’t willing to trade pascal and FVV to a player a la Christian wood or KAT than I demand them to resign from their post . Yes , I love FVV and Pascal however if you want to go the finals or playoffs you need to trade for that guy . If you can’t proceed to the draft we’re you belong until you found that franchise altering player ."
Christian Wood
"This guy really put Lavine and Grant over Harden, and CP3 and Christian Wood over Curry and AD LOLOL. Troll post for sure"
"This guy really put Jerami Grant, Zion, and Christian Wood ahead of Giannis lmao."
"dame, christian wood, jamal murray, caris levert, beal, vucevic, the list goes on.  i don't think people realize that underrated means people DONT talk about them, it has nothing to do with all star recognition or anything like that. beal got snubbed last year, but that doesn't make him underrated. people are now calling him the second best SG in the league. if anything, that makes him OVERrated."
"i know it's pretty tangential, but look at the collector industry if you want to get a sense of just how little respect the Jazz get. Mitchell is an all-star, has smaller accolades like the Dunk Contest win, player of the week/month awards, etc and of course the playoff highlights/records. And his rookie cards sell for... about 10% of Christian Wood from the same brand."
"I mean, he's certainly up there as a candidate, but he's clearly outshined by two players who have made the jump from pseudo-role players to 20+ ppg scorers in Jerami Grant and Christian Wood.  JB's lowkey been really good since last season and is only really going under the radar bc media attention is focused on Tatum."
"Christian Wood but he might actually still be underrated.      He's scoring more PPG than Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker and KAT.      He's rebounding more per game than Adams, AD, Lebron, Luka and Russ.      He's blocking more shots per game than Embiid, Lopez and Giannis"
"It's weird, but I miss the Oilers, so I fucking love it. I pretend John Wall to Christian Wood is Warren Moon to Earnest Givins, and I'm whisked away to childhood.  Luv ya Blue forever. We still fucking *love* the Oilers."
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
That's false. He was only a liability against the Warriors. I'm sure that same team would've exposed Christian Wood as a poor defender and limited scorer too.
"Disagree. Top 25 refers to who, in this moment, is playing the best in the league. You don’t seem as stupid as the other guy, but just to clarify, I didn’t say KAT was top 25. He’s played 4 games and he hasn’t been particularly impactful. There are other guys who are balling rn (Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and Collin Sexton to name a few) and deserve to be top 25 right now."
"Please try to actually read. Nowhere in my comment did I say that KAT was top 25. All I said was that right now Jimmy isn’t. There are tons of players who deserve to be on the list over him rn, e.g Jerami Grant or Christian Wood. Idrc how many downvotes I get. It’s just that rn, Jimmy isn’t top 25 and anyone who seriously thinks that is jumping on the finals bandwagon from last year"

"I'd rather have a healthy Clint Capela. So far, Christian Wood has shown little impact on winning games. He reminds me of MPJ from last year. Sure, he scores a lot, but does he score when it matters most (in the clutch time) and does he provide other value beyond scoring on offense and defense?"
"Jaylen Brown was already a great player. Christian Wood went from 13/6 to 23/10. Grant from 12/3 last year, to 23/6 so far. Grant has made the biggest jump."
Christian Wood or Jerami Grant

Christian Wood deserves to be an all star this year
"I'm pretty sure it's a way of saying how far from their average ppg they will, on average, score. For example, Christian Wood will usually score within 4 points of 23.5 points."
I miss seeing RoCo hit those buckets on the Rockets but at the same time I'm glad we managed to get Christian Wood to more than fill his shoes. Wish him the best though and hope he gets out of his slump.
"I would go to philly picking iverson so I could enjoy his full career. I started watching basketball for real about a year or so before their finals run.  I’d have so many tips for them. Don’t get Chris Webber, get iverson a partner, don’t trade for Bynum, dont draft don’t get rid of vuc, dont draft okafor, don’t get rid of Christian wood/grant/Covington. Elton brand isn’t a good player anymore, don’t get him. Don’t draft fultz, fire brown or don’t trade for butler, expose colangelo sooner...  Jesus Christ, the sixers have soooo many what ifs where they fucked up the choice along the way. I don’t like this game anymore."
"I’ve had such a tough week but i’m up 20 entering tomorrow. Getting Porter, Sexton and Garland back in the latter half of the week has helped. Hunter missed a game. Dejounte Murray hurt. Christian Wood hurt. CJ and Caris now out for a month +. It’s been a rough week for me lol. Best of luck pulling out the W tomorrow"
"You do know the Rockets were missing Christian Wood and Oladipo, right? 2 of their best 3 guys."
"You do know the Rockets were missing Christian Wood, Oladipo, and KPJ right?  The former two being 2 of their best 3 guys."
You mean someone like Christian Wood or Clint Capela?
Somebody get this man whatever they gave Christian Wood
Christian Wood. I doubt anyone thought he’d be averaging 24&amp;10 and 2 blocks per game
Sexton Dort Jerami Grant &amp; Christian Wood
"Already have Christian wood?  I guess they could have gotten better value for him, but he is redundant"
And Christian wood is likely out.
"The Rockets won that trade though. I don’t want to shit talk Clint, because I like him a lot. He’s a good dude and a hard worker, but he is pretty much useless offensively. His responsibilities were to catch lobs and play defense and he had hands of stone about 41 games a season. In half a season, they flipped an injured Capela for Christian Wood. Harden is better with a lob threat/rim runner, but Clint isn’t helping anyone from the bench."
Christian Wood didn't say anything about us. He just said that Shaq is a casual when Shaq admitted about not being aware of him and his great play.
"Besides, you also have Christian Wood."
It's probably Christian Wood tbh at this point but Boucher is definitely a top 3 candidate along with Jerami Grant. I think Boucher can win 6th man if he keeps coming off the bench.
"Christian Wood called Shaq a casual fan for not knowing who he was before he had a big game. By Calling Shaq a casual he was saying that he does not pay a lot of attention to the NBA, because on a casual fan would not know who Christian Wood is."
"I got criticised for saying Capela is better than Christian Wood but I stand by it. Threeball or not, Capela is just a beast."
I understand that the Rockets didn’t really need Jarrett Allen because Christian Wood is so good for them. But they definitely could’ve gotten more for him than Exum+ 2022 Bucks pick. Not much of a return for a very good young center.
Christian Wood has entered the chat
"We got Christian Wood and two first round picks for Roco, I think we did well overall. Really happy seeing Capela take his game to the next level."
"Probably a bit too soon, but Christian Wood this year may be an example. He played 4 seasons, missed another season entirely, and bounced from team to team and the G League. In that time, had highs of 13.1 ppg and 6.3 rpg. This year, his 6th year since being drafted, he’s averaging 23.5 and 10.8."
Christian Wood
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't heard him say ""I said that I don't think you have what it takes to get to the next  level. Thoughts?"" to their face after they put up 36/7/5 while overcoming a 16 pt deficit and increasing their win streak to 7, while also becoming the fastest player to make 600 3s.  I don't think people are all that upset about what they said at halftime. It's a totally fair/accurate observation to say that Donovan is not a superstar. Of course we love the guy, but I don't think any of us are putting him at the same level as LeBron, KD, Kawhi.  People are annoyed because his schtick is immature and getting old. Asking Jokic if he's Russian, saying he's never watched Christian Wood play, constantly going on about how all it takes is being 7'1 to get paid $200 million. There's a difference between joking around and being flat out disrespectful, and he seems to not care about that line."
Christian Wood was right about Shaq. This years Clippers team plays completely different.
Christian Wood.
Are we forgetting Jerami Grant and Christian Wood or...
He also apparently didn't really know about Christian Wood. If you didn't have Wood on your radar since at least the end of last season you're clearly not paying close attention to what's happening around the league.
"Shaq is really being constructive when he calls Rudy Gobert a bum and overpaid, that's really actionable advice that he can use to improve his game. Also when he tells Donovan Mitchell that he can't take that next step and that he doesn't know who Christian Wood is. All really great, constructive criticism that totally doesn't come from a negative place.   Also, how tf is LeBron trying to make himself the victim here? This isn't about you bruh"
I remember when Christian Wood called him a casual straight up
Christian wood is better than DJ and PJ tucker is better than that other guy. That's not even taking guys like Eric Gordon into account.
35 is probably an understatement. Half the league's centers today would have been power forwards in the league 15-25 years ago. Can you imagine the kinds of things Shaq would do to guys like Christian Wood.  Sure Shaq might give up a couple extra baskets in the pick and roll. Teams would literally have to add bigger players to their rosters and change their game plan to match up on the other side.
"He didn't know who christian wood was, he's a casual"
Shaq giving Christian Wood depression just like Lebron did to Kevin Love
at the very least he'll throw a half-eaten sandwich at Christian Wood
"is that really what this is?  so he talks down on people that are admittedly, actually very good.... so what? maybe it’s that he has an old and jaded view of the game.... but it’s not hurting anyone. Most of these guys don’t take it seriously or use it as fuel. you think Christian Wood goes to sleep crying bc Shaq didn’t know who he was?  im gonna take all the examples of Shaq having fun and doing good things on his personal platform over what he says on an entertainment broadcast aimed at casuals."
Christian Wood
"He could’ve worded it differently. The way he did it was disrespectful, especially for someone as talented as Christian Wood."
"Imagine clowning Donovan Mitchell and Christian Wood. Two of the most hardworking and humble guys in the league. Some of the others are up for criticism, but he took it too far."
For Christian Wood
I keep forgetting that Christian Wood was in Philly. I wonder if he would have improved like he has over the last two years if he was still in Philly.
"Makes you realize how crazy the nba can be, that team had a lot of talent, but none of that talent was on the same timeline. Same could be said about that Philly team that had rookie Covington, mcconell, and Christian wood"
"Can't think of a 2nd guard for my 2nd round/undrafted Hinkie lineup. McConnell, Covington, Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes. Just a handful of the best role players in the league."
Bro Christian Wood was legit balling during his stint with the Pelicans.. tail end of the regular season go watch that shit. He shows the whole package of offensive versatility
Christian Wood been playing meaningful games for like half a season.
Clint can't shoot 3s but i still think he's better than Christian Wood.
Christian Wood is hurt.
Collin Sexton &amp; Christian Wood would like a word
Christian Wood.
Over Christian Wood bro?
"""Christian Wood also wet the bed in middle school one time, he has really come a long way..."""
"eh not really, he was injured for the year and HOU only center was IH so we switched to small ball. It ended up turning into Christian Wood. Wood &gt; Cli(n)t"
"Christian wood beat on who? You sound stupid, she left him because he didn’t get drafted"
"""And that's now 24 and... (sips chamomile tea) 12 rebounds for Christian Wood, what a great signing that was"""
If the Raps turn it around I'd give 6th man to Boucher  MIP has to go to Jerami Grant or Christian Wood though
"""Oh, you a casual."" - Christian Wood"
"Christian wood, boucher, ibaka, dillion brooks. The grizzlies franchise."
remember when christian wood called out shaq for being a casual? yeah.
"Honestly even most of the times people have thought he should’ve been more aggressive there’s a great case he was right at this point with how Brown and Tatum are playing. Trading either of them for a year of Kawhi or PG or something would’ve been a bad idea. There are definitely misses he’s had, but most of those aren’t just his miss — every GM except the one who made a given move also missed. A great example is I’ve seen a few Celtics fans hold not finding a way to get Christian Wood against him, but everyone except the Rockets made the same mistake."
"Came here to say this. It's like he picks a center and then just list all the flaws *he* thinks they have.  Embiid shoots too many threes, Gobert doesn't score enough, didn't even know Christian Wood, and so on..."
"Can’t even think of anyone else, gobert? Christian wood? With out AD, Jokic is obvious and with the way he’s playing might have gotten it over AD anyways."
Christian wood has barely played
How do players rank Melo over Christian Wood lol
"You are telling me you would start Christian Wood over the DPOY, a guy who anchors a top 2 defense in the league and who’s team has the best record in the league?"
Going for the deepest team cuz I’m building the team on 2k with no injuries and gonna see how it goes!  Starters: PG: John Wall ($15) SG: Klay Thompson ($16) SF: Demar Derozan ($13) PF: Christian Wood ($13) C: Nikola Vucevic ($17  Bench: PG: Terry Rozier ($6) SG: Collin Sexton ($14) SF: Andrew Wiggins ($9) PF: Julius Randle ($6) C: Clint Capela ($9)  Roster Fillers: Kevin Knox: ($1) Isaiah Thomas: ($1)
Give Christian wood the mvp
Christian Wood got injured?!?!
"Bruh I’m in Houston and I’m sure many of us Rockets fans including myself have gone off the grid for the past 4 days. I don’t know what is happening with them, apparently they got injuries? Who’s injured and why?  Edit: Christian Wood got injured apparently!"
"If the nba really wanted to be safe, they should postpone all games until Christian Wood has recovered from his injury👍👍   Please god get better soon C Wood"
Dwight howard last year  Christian wood going to the pistons now the rockets  Oladipo going to the pacers  Terry rozier  Jarred vanderbilt
Christian Wood
"He’s really fucking good. Funny, I don’t ever see Pistons fans trashing Christian Wood for leaving. Detroit fans still root for him. Nuggets fans take any chance they get to trash Jerami.  Even after a 43 point game.   Seems like an insecure fan base. Jerami wanted to go to Detroit to play in a black city, for a black coach and black GM. And he wanted to show the league he was more than a role player. Troy Weaver believed in him enough to let him expand his game. Jerami is classy as fuck. He just left your team.   Get over it. He’s really good and proved it."
"Giannis is the 2 time MVP of the league.  Idgaf if I don't win the title.  Give me talent on my team.  Only one team wins the title every year.  You're chasing a pipe dream ESPECIALLY after you lost Harden.  By your championship defining logic Harden isn't good either cause he couldn't reach the finals.  Go trade for Kyle Kuzma.  He's got a ring!  Aside from the fact that you are blind to the fact that Simmons is a top 20 player at worst, you still haven't answered how drafting rookies in the teens since you don't have your own pick next year or praying on the Nets picks in a few YEARS from now is going to help you build around 25 year old Christian Wood.  By the time your picks come around Wood will be nearing his 30's.  If you wanted to build around Wood, Simmons was your best bet.  Simmons is succeeding DESPITE the awful fit next to Joel and he's 24.  Like how do you not see ANY upside there but want to gamble on picks years down the line or keep wishing your miracle championship superstar can be traded for some day.  That is if they actually want to be in Houston since every star dictates where they want to be now."
"Right: Gordon Hayward, Christian Wood, Lamelo Ball being good at some point  Wrong: Jerami Grant, Lamelo Ball not being the worst player in the league in his first season"
The million picks were owed in the next decade? Christian wood?
Christian Wood is 25 and you don't have your own pick next year.  How many years are you going to be waiting to surround him?  Meanwhile Ben Simmons is a top player who's game not only meshes well with Woods but is also similar age wise.
They could have won a championship if they had stayed together. I hate their relationship soured as a Rockets fan. Imagine still making the Covington trade but having first round picks left to get Christian Wood from Detroit.
"The eye test has shown Zach has been solid on defense this season, you’re just making stuff up at this point. Also just to prove how dumb RAPTOR is we can go with them showing Christian Wood being the 4th best defender in the league this season when if you watch the games he’s been below average on defense at best. And yeah Gobert struggles in the playoffs but y’all are like a 7th or 8th seed without him if you even make the playoffs."
"https://www.slamonline.com/nba/pistons-warned-not-to-sign-christian-wood-in-2019/  Whether the concerns were legitimate or if that's the reason teams passed on him, I don't know. But there were concerns going back to his pre-draft process, which is a big reason why he went undrafted."
"Christian wood last year averaged 13 and 6 this year is averaging 22 and 10, but hes probably gonna fall behind due to a recent injury, I would think randle is the frontrunner moving forward unless there's someone I'm forgetting about"
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Dončić  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
Christian Wood on the Rockets. Dude was making a lot of noise here and just in general until I think he got an ankle injury?
That’s what happens when 3 of your 4 best players are out 😭😭😭 I miss Christian Wood
I miss Christian Wood and warm weather.
I think we did f\*ck up though. We waived Christian Wood for no reason. Could have had three all-star nominated guys on the team. Wood wasn't putting bad numbers up when he was here and he'd be a great floor spacer.
If Drummond takes away minutes from Christian Wood I will be so disappointed. It will be the most disappointment I have ever experienced with Wood.
"I don’t remember if we lost 50 games, but the 2018-2019 second half of the season Pels were a lot of fun to watch. The roster sans AD was Jrue and a bunch of scrappy guys including Jahlil Okafor, Kenny Hustle, Stanley Johnson, Dairis Bertans, Ian Clark, Frank Jackson and Christian Wood (😥).   I remember we beat Denver and Utah on the road then got 40 pieced by Orlando. Good times."
"Christian Wood is now getting overrated, he’s a horrible defender in a position that’s the most important. He’s not #7"
Rafael Stone of the Rockets  - first year as GM  - navigated through the Harden drama  - signed Christian Wood (on track to be an all star)  - signed Jaesean Tate (on track to be all rookie)  - signed Kevin Porter Jr (averaging 27 in the G league)
"christian wood. saw he had a good streak of games for the pistons during the end of the season but didn’t see why we would give him such a contract (but to be fair, every man and their dog is getting a bag). turns out he’s a 20/10 machine  i hope he gets better soon :("
low effort because late and tired  1. KAT 2. DBook 3. DLo/Oubre/Zinger? not sure really havent kept up on em. Heard Oubre doing good tho. 4. Myles Turner  5. Christian Wood 6. Terrrrryyyy 7. Trez 8. Norm 9. JRich the 2nd 10. whoever the fuck Branden Dawson is
"The tricky part is that part of the reason he went undrafted is because of his attitude/work ethic problems. I remember a few draft analysts said there are prospects where teams think they will be good someday, but don't expect the player to last on their first couple teams. So they aren't worth a pick if you don't think they'll figure it out with you.   Christian Wood might be like that. If teams were actually redrafting with future knowledge, he'd probably go a lot lower than expected."
Myles Turner is way better than Christian Wood
"Teams like the Nuggets and Mavs with playoff hopes but shitty defense would be willing to give some picks and young players for Smart. I could easily see a MPJ for Marcus Smart swap.  If we wanted to get crazy, I think Smart + tons of picks could land the Celtics Christian Wood (ik Rockets fans will crucify me, but you’d rather have 4 first rounders, trust me). I also think that picks + exception could get them a guy even as good as Kyle Lowry (not this exact player but a guy of that caliber and circumstance).  They could also benefit from a Steven Adams/Clint Capela, but I don’t know how realistic those options are.  Honestly, as long as the Celtics have two All-NBA level wings they will be competitive, but I doubt they could beat a defensive team like the Bucks or Sixers."
Christian Wood
This team really needed a big man and they decided not to go out and get Christian wood or Myles turner
Christian Wood.
"I really think Christian Wood had a great chance until he got hurt.   Right now, I'd so Mitchell, Zion, Gobert, AD for the last 4 spots, and then Fox, and I'm torn between Booker/PG13 for last spot. Fox might be below them honestly but I really want him to make it lol"
Christian Wood from MIP to MVP
"I'm not necessarily saying it's cut-and-dried. I *do* think record matters. But statistically? Is Mitchell really ahead of Shai or Fox or Zion or Ingram?  What about the Suns? They're the 4-seed, and we haven't mentioned anybody on that team. (And the guy we should mention is Paul, not Booker)  What about the Spurs? They're 1 game out of the 4-seed...what does that mean for DeRozan?   Or if you care less about narrative and team record, Malik Beasley is having a pretty damn solid year, and I can make the  case for him over Mitchell (especially if I have *Conley* over Mitchell.)  Obviously he's hurt *now* but Christian Wood was putting up 22-10.   If CJ had played more games, he'd be clearly ahead of Donovan, too.   and, of course, KAT has missed most of the year (which obviously makes his case a non-starter) but if he hadn't, that would be another guy clearly ahead of Mitchell.   My point is that that phrase (""all star caliber"") should mean something like ""top 25"" not ""top 40""  because only 24 guys get to be all stars.  And it's very possible to be a top-2 seed with just one top-25 guy."
"""I don't think you have what it takes"" is pretty unecessary. Not to mention his random comments about not watching Christian Wood or messing up Jokic's nationality."
"I still don't get what the pels were thinking giving assets for Steven Adams when guys like Jakob Poeltl, Derrick Favors, Christian Wood, and other centers were signing for cheaper than the extension they gave Adams in free agency"
He looked like Christian Wood in the past few games
Christian Wood without shooting is Capela
"Christian Wood is out with an injury and John Wall / half the team been injured.  The team was never going to be good without harden, but harden not buying in held the team back regardless."
"Frank Kaminsky looks like a regular guy that you stretched out and Mikal Bridges looks like Oscar from Shark Tale. Christian Wood looks like Scottie Pippen and I’m not even sure that Jae’Sean Tate is a real person.   2&gt;1. Sorry, I win, you lose."
Jae'Sean Tate and Christian Wood and nothing you make up will be believable.
"Refused to start Christian Wood gave him 15-25 minutes last year, even after they traded Drummond. Sometimes Markieff got more minutes, started Thon Maker over him, it was so random. Only until when the season was a wrap for the Pistons he started him."
"Shaq, Kazam, Shaq-fu, Vin diesel, Shaquille, the black Irishman, Superman, mr. Skittles, proto-Dwight, the bald goliath, shatter of back boards, mr. Nimble toes, big Ballet, mr. 12 piece, giant honey, the oblong from Orlando, the legend from LA, the man from Miami, the beast from Boston, the chief from Cleveland, the guy who didnt know who Christian wood was, the man who said something not nice about Donovan, ect."
Christian Wood
I would put in fox or spida or booker over derozan though he’s having a good year.  Think it comes down to those 3 unless Conley or Paul don’t make it.    I think Christian wood seriously deserved consideration for the last spot before his injury however
Crucifix for Christian Wood is pretty clever too
I thought Christian Wood was considered terrible at defense too.
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."
"Zach lavine was pretty good last year, I think Christian Wood gets it - or grant either one is deserving"
Christian Wood
Christian Wood is Top 1. Also Dejounte Murray deserves way more recognition than he’s getting.
Christian Wood
Who this guy? He moves like Christian Wood kinda
"I’m a simple man. I see Christian Wood is not #1, I downvote.   /s"
"For reference, here are the numbers for a few G League players who have broken out in recent years:  Chris Boucher: 27pts/11rbs/4blks  Christian Wood: 29pts/14rbs/2blks  Duncan Robinson: 21pts/4rbs/3asts 69% TS"
cant be worse than bryn forbes defensively and he offers more in half court offense than pat and craig..I just hope bud doesnt Christian wood or sterling brown him.
"Its not just about the Jazz, this is the second time this year Shaq has done this, the first was with Christian Wood from the Rockets. Im not saying its 100% fact its for views but im also not gonna pretend it would surprise me if it was, especially from shaq."
"Christian Wood didn’t even improve. He’s been a stud. If you watched the last 10 games in Detroit it was pretty predictable that he was gonna play like this. Not even the last 10 games, the whole season last year. Shit even go back to his Pelicans days! That’s not most improved, that’s just an All star.  Meanwhile, Grant came out of no where. No one and literally no one though he could make a leap like he did"
The whole Tuesday crew is terrible. Candace Parker called Christian Wood “Tristan Woods”
"Oh what could've been if the Sixers kept Hinkie.  Embiid-Saric-Grant-Covington-Simmons, with Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and TJ McConnell off the bench. Or maybe Redick is still signed then either Saric or Grant can come off the bench.  Also knowing Hinkie, he would've gotten a much better return from trading Noel, Okafor, and Fultz."
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I’d put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That’s 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There’s 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
"Oladipo is just out of the threshold too (25 points in his next game will get him back to 20 ppg) and I'd put Malik over him. He also has the fewest minutes of anyone in the discussion (other than Christian Wood), so his numbers would probably look *slightly* better with better management from Saunders (not to mention coaching). I'd put him over FVV and Oladipo for sure, maybe Tobias Harris is in the conversation as well, though he's been playing better this year than last. EDIT: And D'Lo is also arguable so far this year."
"Christian wood would have eaten us alive, We can't beat teams with good big men"
"Christian Wood didn't play, says all you need to know"
"Christian wood is there, I doubt you need another center."
Other front offices actually don’t have time to watch every lakers game however.  It’s usually just someone maybe focuses on games from each division for scouting.  Talens a talent but no one is giving him 15mil unless he gets traded to a team mid season that starts him.  He’s also not a starting guard on over 25 teams in the league and no backup gets 15mil.  You saw what Christian wood got right and he was a monster last year.
Christian wood does this like once a game
“I want to win” -Christian Wood
Christian Wood
Christian Wood.   Houston was 11-10   He gets hurt   We are now 11-27

Yeah imagine a young core consisting of KPJ-KJ Martin-Christian Wood-Jarrett Allen and whoever you get in the lottery this year. That would be fantastic
"I think James Harden had a serious point. Granted Christian Wood has been injured, and I think they’ll be much better with him on the floor, that team sucks pretty bad."
"number 27 for the Sixers is kind of interesting  https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400828119  Harden dropped 50 because of course he did  Sixers played against Dwight Howard and Corey 🅱️rewer  You’ll recognize several OG processors such as RoCo, Jerami Grant, and Regular Jah.

"7-10 in RPM are Devonte Graham, Mike Conley, Christian Wood, and Lonzo Ball. Even if it regularizes over time, 30 games is pretty solid sample size and none of those guys have been anywhere near Jokic, Dame, Durant, Irving, Kawhi, CP3, and Luka, who are all outside the top 10. RPM just seems like a pretty bad metric."
"They are 5 games away from the 12 seed. They've lost 16 straight games. They were 3-6 even when Harden was there. They're laughably far from a top team, believe us, we weren't expecting them to be a top seed. What part of 35 year old PJ Tucker, rusty John Wall, discontent Victor Oladipo, and Christian Wood is better than literally any of the teams in front of them besides... Thunder maybe? Kings maybe? The 11 seed in the west has 2 young all stars, when do you project this Rockets team to surpass them? Until then, best they could be is 12, and the other 3 teams around them all have better young stars."
"For those swaps to convey, not only do the Nets have to be bad, but the Rockets also have to be better than the Nets.  I think one of those unprotected picks is Milwaukee's pick.  There will obviously be no pick-swap in 2021.  Barring a historic collapse, next year's Nets and Bucks picks (by way of Cavs) will be ~25-30th - the kind of picks you trade to get a Markieff Morris or something like that.  With the Rockets rebuilding, it looks improbable that the swap conveys in 2023.  Christian Wood is a fine player, but I don't see them emerging as a playoff team in three years.  Maybe Nets start to regress in 2024 and they get a 20th pick?  So that's five picks that are probably not valuable at all.  That leaves 2025 swap, 2026 pick, and 2027 swap.  Historically (looking back at the last 20 years or so), the chances of getting an all-star caliber player in the late lottery (5-13) range of the NBA draft is less than 15%?  Even with three top 5 picks, where the chances of getting an all-star are closer to 33%, you can reasonably expect to draft . . . one Ben Simmons, one high-quality role player, and one bust.  Why not just take Ben Simmons + a couple of picks *now* rather than waiting for the chance to get a player like him 5 years into the future?"
this is due to missing Christian Wood right?
Not that worried tbh.  Would be very worried if we didn't have Christian Wood (and to a lesser extent KPJ).  If we keep the pick we're well ahead of the curve in terms of rebuilding.  If we lose it we're about where you'd expect to be as a newly rebuilding team.  Also from your OP can't really tell if you realize HOU keeps the pick if it's top 4 - will be a little better odds than a coin flip that they keep it.
And acting like the roster was the problem when he was already set on BK before the season started. We didn't even have Christian Wood yet.
christian wood hasn't played in a while and he's pretty much the best player on the team
Christian wood comes back and ruins it for us.  I'd love nothing more than to go on a 100+ game losing streak or until Tillman sells the team. Shit went from contender to titanic in 1.5 seasons.
Christian Wood bout to sweep the award by that logic
"I think u are overhyping Theis, he is a great backup center, but he is not worth 60/4. Like Christian Wood is making 41/3 and he was playing at an all star level before he got hurt, u really think Theis is gonna make 60/4 LMAO."
"Don’t forget Christian Wood, shooting 42% from 3"
Christian Wood for MVP lmao. This dude had them looking somewhat respectable after the harden trade and before he got injured
Christian Wood otw
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"I understand ...I can see how others may not, but i feel like I understand what you are trying to compare. MJ seems to take risks on certain players because he likes something he sees in them (ie, the story about what he said to Christian Wood when Wood was with the Hornets). I can see how taking a risk on Terry and taking a risk on Lance could be considered kind of similar. Unfortunately for the hornets, MJ is nowhere near as good a talent evaluator as he was at playing basketball"
Players need opportunity and touches in order to develop. There are only so many shots to go around in a game. Christian Wood and Jerami Grant would have been low usage roleplayers playing behind Simmons and Embiid as opposed to the fringe all stars they are now.
Ibaka? Gasol? Make a run at Christian Wood? Take a flyer on Harry Giles? Willey Cauley Stein? Harrell? Juan Hernangomez? Dwight Howard? Literally anyone but the worst starting centre in the league would have been just fine
The Rockets still have a losing with Christian Wood (and that included some Harden games). Miami has a top 5 record with him and the worst in the league without him.
Then Christian Wood should be MVP lmao
"Christian Wood isn’t valuable to the league as a whole.  Christian Woods performance isn’t moving the needle for the NBA product.  Embiid, Giannis, Jokic all compelling and deserving, but what’s the total package there?  Right now the the best package is LeBron, being old and performing.   That’s what’s most valuable to the league right now."
"The rockets are 0-15 with Christian Wood out, I think he should be in the conversation."
Than Christian Wood is the true MVP and MIP
"Christian Wood!  While I’m happy he’s finally getting recognition, people going too far saying he’s AD or something. He’s shit on defence, and his PER 36 since 2018 are nearly identical."
I remember a game several years ago when he was with the Bulls and playing against the Hornets. He was red hot from three and was slapping the floor and talking all this shit nonstop. I couldn’t even be mad honestly. I’m glad he seems to have figured it out.   He and guys like Christian Wood are reminders that progress in the NBA isn’t always linear and takes longer for some folks than others.
Christian Porter Wood and Kevin Junior
&gt;Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Junior   Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Junior
Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Junior
Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Junior
Christian Wood is the MVP then lmao
"First Christian Wood, then AD, now Embiid. Fuck this season."
"Good. We have been playing like half or more of this season without AD; even then he was out of shape, but still showing up in the big games (Christmas, Rockets to destroy Christian Wood, Chicago home game, and Celtics off the top of my head). With AD we are still fucking scary, and we’re still winning games without him.   As long as he comes back healthy with like 25% of the season and the playoffs, Lakers are still probably the scariest team in the West in a 7 game series."
"Christian Wood and John Wall are pretty good second and third options. Eric Gordon is a good 6 man. John Wall's stats this season are not much different than when he was in his prime other than reduced assists. Had they been healthy, they would've been in the mix for the 8-10 seed without Harden."
"Yes, I know. Would you like me to clarify, they looked good after the Harden trade and before Christian Wood got hurt."
They had Christian Wood before the Harden trade
They looked good before Christian Wood got hurt.
"The rockets are a disaster because they have had by far the worst injury luck of any team in the NBA this season except maybe the wolves. Before Christian Wood got hurt, they were around 0.500 and had a better record without Harden than with him.  Had Harden bought in and they had typical injury issues, they certainly would've made the playoffs and could've made the second round."
U guys could have had caris levert and jarett allen together with Christian wood and john wall.
It also takes the virus like at least a week typically to incubate. It's not like Rudy got sick a day after touching those mics  Christian Wood played in a game *knowingly having symptoms for Covid and tested positive a day later*
Christian wood
"Ad should qualify as a Pf imo. We also have Julius Randle , Domantas Sabonis , Christian Wood is rising , if Jerami Grant plays Pf then he is also a rising star but yeah still not as much power in it."
I disagree think where the rockets are they fucking need picks. They gave up how much for CP3 Westbrook and (maybe?) RoCo? They need some to start rebuilding around Christian wood. And when you compare three firsts and four swap best to two firsts... it’s a shitty deal
"KPJ is an interesting pick up for them.  Houston has surprisingly put themselves into a position to have a quick turnaround with their rebuild with some shrewd pick ups.   They are playing poorly now, but the current roster is much better than their 11-24 record suggests.   Christian Wood (arguably their best player) has missed a lot of time, but they were over .500 with him in the line-up. He's only 25.   Oladipa, who is a tradeable piece and may not be around long, is 28, which give him lots of time an he may bring in a quality prospect or picks.   Wall, at 30, has seen a resurgence and may make that contract of his look reasonable.   An Porter.... he's got some real potential.  If personal issues get worked out, this kid could really be a heck of a player."
Is Christian Wood playing? I’m seeing conflicting info on this.  Jazz fan here - we either win by over 20 or lose by 8.
I think Pascal got it on his rookie deal. Christian Wood being hurt has pushed him down the list for me unless he comes back strong. It's probably Grants award to lose though.
This just means that Christian Wood is the best player in the NBA
"They're not asking Shaq to breakdown a shot chart or some shit, just remember the players name. Know who Christian Wood is. Shit like that, you know?"
"Yeah, I agree with all of his takes, the MVP needing to carry teams to wins I’m not so sure that stands up to scrutiny   If MVPs impact on win columns is the most important stat, then shouldn’t Christian Wood be in the conversation? Rockets were in the playoff hunt and I believe they haven’t won a single game since Wood got hurt   Embiid has rested in a ton of back to backs, much to my fantasy teams chagrin, and the 76ers still have a top record, which is more indicative that Embiid is on a good team than him “willing the team to win”   I think Jokic is the only player that would meet all the criteria Perkins is implying"
"KAT, Gobert, Embiid, Adebayo, Jokic, AD (if we count him as a center) and Sabonis in the first tier. And then guys like Jarrett Allen, Nurkic, Myles Turner, Ayton, Christian Wood, Capela... a lot of amazing centers in the league today. Know I missed a few but i remember when it was pretty much just Dwight and Bynum who were elite."
"I want to get a Christian Wood and Luka jersey which I have neither of now, but after that LaMelo is my top priority."
Bruh Christian Wood playing while fatigued or whatever is a lot different than Rudy touching mics and being a dickhead to try and be funny 😂😂
Shit y’all get credit for Christian wood too right?
"What selfish behavior? He didn't get Covid from touching the mics. He didn't purposely expose himself. And he very well could have gotten it from Christian Wood who he played a few days before, who had symptoms then, and who ended up testing positive. It's not like no one else would have gotten it if he hadn't before April."
"Lol, he's coming out hot with same David Kahn level quotes. So far he hasn't backed it up at all, letting Christian Wood walk for nothing was a horrible move, but well see how he does over the next few years."
I mean ESPN still thinks he's better than Christian Wood and he was set to be an all star before the injury
"They have to get lucky those picks actually become something worth while   Everybody just assumes that because the BK/Bos thing happened that’s the norm when in reality it’s a big time outlier. BKN is a big market and has been well run for years there’s a very decent chance even when KD and Kyrie are gone they don’t actually bottom out the way people assume.  So you have those BKN picks which could easily be far less desirable than people presume, not controlling your own pick this year or in 2024 and some pick swaps. It’s fine but it’s hardly some grand situation that is going to really massively expedite some rebuild at all. Especially considering their only real young cornerstone building block is Christian wood"
Poor Christian Wood. Hope he gets dealt to a team that isn’t rebuilding for once
"http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine   How about this? For exact players and numbers. Also remember Mavs are getting 2 1sts for insurance on the KP trade for players that might only be their for one season. But it’d make their roster a lot more complete and deep. The Rockets would have KPJ, Osman,Terry, Bey, K Martin Jr, and Christian Wood ; 6 players under 25 years of age. In exchange for expiring contract, and 2 overpaid over the hill vets that won’t be apart of the future. Back to Dallas their 11 man rotation is now Brunson, Luka, Oladipo, Richardson, Finney-Smith, Love, Drummond, Kleber, House, Barjanovic, and Cauley-Stein. 6 of which can be moved after this year as well so they could package with a pick or two and perhaps land another star who’s health isn’t such a concern.  Cleveland would want this trade because a KP level player doesn’t just come to Cleveland. (Trust me I’m a Cavs fan) lol plus the rotation would be incredible and I personally believe putting KP at his more natural position the PF/C instead of banging w 5’s every night. Let him use his height and finesse against the small ball lineups. Garland, Sexton, Okoro, KP, Allen starters then Nance, McGee, Prince, and Windler off the bench. Also if they’re playing well potentially PJ or Gordon as well. More so Gordon probably. That’s a solid 9-10 man rotation.   Tell me what you guys think! I think this is realistic and would work. If I’m Dallas I’m doing this because Luka can win now, I don’t want to lean on KP’s health I wanna just lean on Luka’s abilities, skill, and talents."
"One team also has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Joe  Harris, the rockets Have Christian Wood."
"If it’s not Christian Wood, I don’t want any."
"I get your thinking but I think with the direction the NBA is going (longer, faster, shooting more 3's) and how Christian Wood has already shown he can produce the numbers to be an All-Star. It would be a gamble for us to give up an established asset, and watch what Christian Wood would become over the next 6-7 years, knowing what we just hand-fist traded away. Getting players with this build and skillset is incredibly tough to do, and I consider the Rockets very lucky we somehow lucked into him in this contract. Could Bagley become that player? Maybe, but it's not really a risk we would want to take because it's a direct downgrade now. We're building around Wood.  &amp;#x200B;  Yes his contract expires in 3 years... in which he would be eligible for the max from the Rockets. Not a for sure thing he stays of course but that's the risk I'd take going into year 2 and not even think about trade scenarios until year 3 comes around."
"What potential. We watched Christian Wood ball on Bagley earlier this year. Bagley was a -16 BPM against Wood. Yeah, I think we can make a deal out of Bagley and 2 FRPs and 2 FRP pick swaps how's that. Or you can throw in Fox and keep one of each. FOH."
"I love John Wall and I hope we can build a squad around him and Christian Wood, I'd hate it if we trade him before we see what that pair is truly capable of"
"You're a Rockets fan so you're the expert here-if Christian Wood had stayed healthy, do you think he would've been in consideration for an All-Star spot?"
"3-4 years would be a miracle with John walls contract, the thunder owning your picks/rights to swap and Christian wood, your only building block, will be a UFA after 2 more seasons"
"I find NBA player valuation astounding. Just a few years back Christian Wood was considered a bust and now he's straight up a potential max-worthy player? I mean, I havent seen him play recently but what a jump!"
"christian wood is also 25 too though? I guess the idea is he's already all star caliber and will continue to be so for a while, but I'd think jay sean could be a pretty good contender rotation player anywhere from 3-5 years from now?  Guess I don't really understand their timeline"
"The Rockets need Christian Wood, he was having monster impact on both ends"
Christian Wood
time for the full Christian Wood takeover?
"I don’t really see what you mean in the Boston trade as it doesn’t really make sense. As for the Kings giving up fox and then getting him back, there are two problems with using that as an example.   1) Risk - Is the pick you’d get from Boston really worth the risk that Boston just doesn’t give back Fox? There’s a big difference between agreeing and submitting 2 trades at the same time, and agreeing to a deal for 6 months in the future. In the Barnes proposed trade, if the Celtics tried to just make the first deal, and not the second, then the kings would just stop the deal. But in your fox trade, there is no way that the kings can ‘force’ the Celtics to give back fox after the appointed time.   The NBA does discourage in writing agreements that go around the cap. But in the 2 trade scenario there is no written agreement that needs to be made.   2) Kings revenue - the kings still want people to either go to their stadium (post-COVID), or to tune in on TV. In this scenario Fox is the biggest draw.   I actually remembered an example of something like the Barnes trade happening, and it was this offseason between the rockets and the Pistons.   First the rockets traded Ariza + #16 in the draft to the Pistons for a future Pistons first (ended up being a heavily protected pick)  Then a week later the deal was finished with a sign and trade for Christian Wood. This second trade was Christian Wood for the Lakers 2021 second round pick (basically useless).   Doesn’t this trade sound eerily similar to the Barnes trade described?"
"Swap Capela with this year's healthy Christian Wood and I believe they beat the Warriors. While Capela and Wood are borderline all-star level players, having a PnP threat with Harden is too saucy."
"Some fair points. I have never played 2k though. And it's not about signing a better player with Barnes money, although that is certainly possible. It's about flexibility. Let's say SAC wants to trade for Vucevic. Which package do you think Orlando would prefer:   A) Barnes, 1st (lotto protected SAC), a 4MM TPE, and no cap space   B) Three 1st's (2 BOS, 1 lotto protected SAC), Nesmith, a 20MM TPE, and 15MM in cap space.   Keep in mind they're in the position SAC is with little to no chance to win during the remainder of Barnes' contract. It won't happen every time, but I'd say a quality GM will do as well with 15MM in cap space as getting Barnes on 2/40, and we're left with a bunch of assets and flexibility to improve. This is looking at using the cap in just one way, too. What if someone wants to pay you to clear room? TJ Warren and #32 were traded for cash considerations (in real life, not 2k). In my opinion TJ Warren is a better basketball player, on a better contract, than Barnes. De'Anthony Melton and two 2nd's were traded to dump Josh Jackson's salary. Melton recently re-signed for 4/35. I'd rather have Melton at 4/35 than Barnes at 2/40. These opportunities pop up all the time, but you have to be in a position to take them. Let people match on the Crabbe's. Not every move is via RFA. Jerami just went for 3/60 and is better than Barnes. Christian Wood 3/41 via cheap S&amp;T. Jae Crowder 3/30. Sure, I'd rather have Jae + 10 million in cap than Barnes in many situations.      PHI: bottomed out and drafted Embiid, Simmons, used assets and cap flexibility (poorly) in deal for Tobias      LAL: had the cap flexibility to sign LeBron, used cap flexibility and assets from bottoming out to trade for AD      LAC: had the cap flexibility to sign Kawhi, cap/asset flexibility to trade for PG13 (including two MIA 1st's)      BKN: cap flexibility to sign Kyrie/KD, capitalized on Harden deal with assets      UTA: drafted Gobert, Mitchell (via trade), utilized cap space &amp; assets to trade for Conley      These are probably 5 of the top 6 or 7 title contenders this year, and every single one used significant cap flexibility to get where they are. If SAC is actually offered these type of assets for Barnes, who provides no surplus value and limits flexibility, yes I believe keeping him is ridiculous. As it relates to this hypothetical offer, keeping him over two 1st's, Nesmith, a 16MM TPE, and going from ~20MM to ~40MM in cap space would be egregious. Just this past off-season you could've traded one of those BOS 1st's and absorbed Oubre into your TPE. Do that after you spend your 40MM in cap and you've gone from Barnes +20MM in cap to Oubre, however you spent your 40MM in cap, Nesmith, 1st. Someone please tell me how SAC goes from where they are now, to championship contenders, while turning down deals like this. At what point will they get more for Harrison Barnes?"
"Or Christian Wood.  Pretty much anybody except Adams, who is one of the biggest overpays at center since Mosgov and Whiteside."
We could have kept Christian Wood on the roster for around 13m so it really makes no sense. Give me Christian/Jax/Willy Hernangomez any day.
"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
"I mean if we keep our draft pick then it’ll be pretty nice next season  Kevin Porter Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr., Jae’Sean Tate, Christian Wood, plus 2-3 rookies"
"*Christian Wood voice*  Oh, so you're a casual"
"LeBron, KD, Giannis, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, AD, Luka, Embiid, Jokic, Lillard, Beal, Tatum, Butler, CP3, PG, KAT, Gobert, Booker, Simmons, Brown, Westbrook, Zion, Murray, Mitchell, Middleton, Kyrie, Trae Young, Lavine, Randle, Bam, Vucevic, Sabonis, McCollum, Ingram, Hayward, Brogdon, SGA, Fox, Lowry, Christian Wood, DeRozan, Holiday, LaMelo, Kemba, D’Angelo, Morant. You’re actually right, he may just be top 50."
High ankle sprains fuck players up bad. LeBron is not gonna be the same once he comes back. It took Ja a long time to get right and Christian Wood still looks out of sorts at times.
Wiseman + Min pick for Christian Wood
Maybe Christian Wood?? Idk how good he is on defense but I’d really want a big as the 3rd option there with them. Preferably one that could pass.
That's a bold statement. Christian Wood and Porter Jr. are both solid young pieces. All it takes is a ping pong ball bounce.   Want to clarify that Fertitta sucks though.

"Wiseman is not worth Christian Wood. One is an extremely raw prospect with injury problems who was statistically the worst impact player in the NBA this year. The other looks like a burgeoning fringe all-star. Wiseman probably has a higher ceiling but considering their relative value to both teams, I'd say the Rockets could get A LOT more than Wiseman from the Rockets. Doubt the Rockets are in any hurry to help out the Warriors, too (nor should they)."
"If the Minny pick converts, honestly I’d rather take a pick from this deep draft class. If we somehow end up with Jalen green, I will be ecstatic.  Trading for another star might kill the spacing when Klay gets back. It’s have to be for someone like Christian wood or Myles turner."
What would you give up for Christian Wood?
I mean I was crying out to get Christian wood in the off season. Saw the potential fixes our rebounding and a really good scorer in the paint that can stretch the floor. Instead we give Leonard a horrible contract to sit in the bench. Now if some dude on reddit can see that instantly makes us so much better wtf is our front office doing?? So many questions about what they were thinking and it drives me insane
"Grant has cooled off a bit and Christian wood was out for quite a while, I don't think anyone can contest randle at this point"
CHRISTIAN WOOD!!!
They traded capela and a first for RoCo and a second. Then flipped RoCo for 2 firsts and then flipped one of those firsts for Christian wood.    Capela who was injured for  A playoff run and series win with RoCo Christian wood A first A second  Worth
Jarrett Allen is rumored to be given a contract extension somewhere around 100 million dollars this offseason. We did not want to pay for that.  Same principle w LeVert ig considering Dipo was expiring and we also wanted to make a playoff push to make Christian Wood happy so Dipo was perceived to be better than LeVert.  Overall it’s damn near impossible to get equal value for a guy like Harden and most of the package is tied in those 2025/26/27 picks and pick swaps which will take years to know the true value of. We prob could have done better but idk if we keep our pick this year we will be looking pretty decent
Christian Wood is 25 too. Tate might fit into the timeline fine.
Wasn't Christian Wood being touted as a MIP contender earlier this season? Definitely didn't look like it when Godbert was on the court.
"Would probably go with the Rockets. Bad ownership can really doom a team and Fertitta is truly awful. It can be overcome a bit by a solid front office and coaching (see Phoenix), but they’re really at ground zero outside of having Christian Wood and KPJ. Minnesota is bad, but KAT’s still a legitimate young star and one of the more valuable pieces in the league. That alone puts them above Houston in my view."
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
It's definitely a bad contract but it's not terrible. The real head scratcher is that the pelicans gave up assets to have the opportunity to give Adams 17M/year in an offseason where guys like Christian Wood signed for less and Jakob Poeltl and Chris Boucher signed for like half the amount per year.
Christian Wood is 25 you complete ignorant fool.

Yeah Christian Wood is nice but he’s nowhere near Bam defensively. We’ve been starting those two and those lineups score a lot but they get scored on a fuck ton
"&gt;Dont need inneficient high usage LeVert taking KPJ’s shots  Levert FG percentage: 43.3%, Levert True shooting: 52.24%  Porter Jr. FG percentage: 41.4%, Porter Jr. True shooting: 50.16%  &gt;besides, he doesnt fit our timeline  Levert is 26. How long are the Rockets planning to be bad for? Christian Wood and Jae'sean Tate are 25 btw. Do 30 year olds Olynyk and Bradley on expiring contracts fit the Rockets' timeline? You're in denial lol."
I’ve been watching the rockets a little bit just for KPJ and Christian Wood. Really hope they make something together.
Christian Wood
"Idk about good, but they just need good enough. They’re only looking for a 3rd string big man.  And you never know what you can find. Christian Wood was waived multiple times at the same age."
"Yup. I won’t act like we’re innocent, sitting horford for the season should have been fine-worthy at the least, given that past teams have been punished similarly for doing that. But everything else is just bad injury luck. Like when the rockets lost Christian wood and lost ~20 straight, this is pretty similar to that. And most of our guys are back in the lineup now, but missing SGA due to plantar fasciitis means that we’re just gonna not win very many games."
"Beal is the dream but it probably won’t happen.  Gordon Hayward, Christian Wood, one of Turner/Sabonis, S&amp;T for John Collins, maybe Issac (also unlikely I think)?  If I were a GM I’d really want Wiseman but it might be hard to find a perfect match"
Christian wood would be a great fit in minnesota
"LOL. For real though, if you put Lebron and AD (from last year and in full health) on all the teams in the NBA with their existing rosters, are there any teams that wouldn't be championship contenders?  I think the worst teams right now in the East are probably Orlando and Detroit, but by being in East, I think they'd still be contenders with Lebron and AD though it would be tough now that Orlando has gutted their team.  In the West, Minnesota has talent so I think they'd be good, but maybe Houston? Even then, John Wall as the 3rd option with Christian Wood at center isn't bad."
How is Christian Wood over Ayton? lol
Christian Wood? You’ve got to be kidding me?
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
"I'm definitely pulling for strings, but Ima throw out Jamal Murray. Can't really think of anybody else  Edit: Christian Wood showed signs as well"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
"Hmm.. actually John Wall + Eric Gordon + Jerami Grant + Christian Wood + KAT is a very solid starting 5 with plenty of athleticism, shooting &amp; versatility. DLo, Terrance Ross, Ant Edwards, Malik Beasley coming off the bench gunning threes.. or Gary Harris and Otto Porter if they're healthy in this scenario  Idk about championship but it'd be a pretty nasty team in the East. Probably 4th seed ahead of Atl and behind Phi/Bkn/Mil"

"Not that any of this has something to do with the topic, but he didn’t give his team COVID. They (including Rudy) almost certainly got it from Christian Wood, who they played a few games earlier while he was knowingly playing with flu-like symptoms. He tested positive right after Rudy did.   Ya’ll want Gobert to be the villain, but Christian Wood was the real irresponsible one and is almost certainly NBA patient zero.   (To be clear I’m not defending Rudy’s mic touching stunt, that was very stupid, but ain’t what shut down the NBA or gave anyone COVID.)"
If you say land the 7th overall pick would you trade that for Christian Wood
Christian wood is clearly the most important player in the league.
Statistical list [surprised me somewhat for this year](https://go.nba.com/c1lc)  AD is the best roll man to me. Christian Wood is the best one people don’t think of
"The pelicans are an awful defensive team, it's not like he's that great. Giving up assets to pay him 17M/year in an offseason where Jakob Poeltl signed for 9M/year and Christian Wood signed for 14M/year was obviously a mistake."
Maybe Christian Wood or Seth Curry then.
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
What happened to Christian Wood? I thought he was hooping at the beginning of the season
"The Sixers were an embarrassment and ruined basketball by unearthing players like Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Christian Wood and Richaun Holmes."
Its close but I’d still say Christian Wood to my Rockets is #1 at least in the long run. Gafford looks like a real player tho damn
"Plan A longshots: Harden, Giannis, Embiid, etc.   Plan B stars: Beal, Paul George, etc  Plan C pseudo-stars: Hayward, Lonzo, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, etc."
"When you cherrypick 40 games of an 11 season career to validate a point made a decade ago. And then it's not valid.  Whose growth has he inhibited in Houston? Breakout player Christian Wood? Future all-rookie Jae'Sean Tate? Oh, probably Kenyon Martin Jr, who scores 77% of his buckets off assists."
I would trade Wiseman for Christian Wood.
"His three ball needs some work, but he's not terrible from deep and actually has a really nice touch in the mid-range.  I wouldn't write him off developing a nice three point touch sooner rather than later - approx 70% FT is decent for a big out of college that's still growing into his frame.  With that said, yeah, he's definitely a 5.  There are some schemes where he and another big could play amorphous frontcourt roles, though - like in Houston with Christian Wood."
Christian Wood tested positive the next day so it was definitely inevitable
"Wow , that is way more than christian wood. Is he that much better?"
We traded Christian Wood for half a season of this guy
"Like I fuckkng said jackass he’s terrific when you have someone else running the offense. But he’s also very one dimensional. I’ve watched AC since fucking summer league when we ran him with Zo, Matt Thomas, Kuz and Zublocka. He’s not elite defensively,...very good yes, elite no. Not bad he proven he can even start a full season. Not a shot creator, not that good creating for others in the half court, has been very up and down as a shooter. Despite hitting 40% he doesn’t create the kind of gravity you would expect because he can’t come off of screen or pin downs.   He absolutely has struggled against sg’s in the past defensively, and he doesn’t create much offense for himself “though I will credit him his last year on a two way contract he really showed me more than I expected offensively for like 10 games or so at the end of the season when we were already eliminated from postseason. And he’s had a few good games this year like that such   Caruso hits at 40%, but like I’ve said over and over, he is hesitant to take the shot. For all the open looks he receives only take 2 triples a game is low. Ac is an absolutely terrific role player and I have never fuckkng denied that. But I’m not paying a guy like Caruso anything over ten million if I don’t have a star player do I sting the ball in the half court allowing him to simply defend and catch and shoot. Like I said from the fucking start!!! He’s worth 12 for the lakers and a few other teams. But he is absolutely not a 12 million dollar player in the grand scheme of things.   How many times have we seen overachievers get paid and then struggle outside of the systems that made them look like studs. I guess you would say he’s as good as Marcus smart? Or a Josh richardson,....or anywhere near as good as a Christian wood who only makes 14. Think about this. Caruso is extremely similar to dellavadova in cleveland with bron. Top level d, huh iq, limited skill level, good shooting percentages on lower volume. I’m not paying that kind of money to AC fresh when I gotta still pay THT, Drummond (perhaps even tho he kinda sucks), Dennis, and possibly McLemore. 12 million is just too high for a type of player you can get for cheaper out of a vet."
"TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Dario Saric. Those were process guys, not first round picks, but second rounders/undrafted/gleague players/eurostash never coming over players. And they're each putting in work somewhere and earning good minutes. The only reason Silver intervened was because we weren't a small market, we were a big market and we blew up an 8 seed roster which had failure after failure and no obvious way forward to contention, it took us 5 years to go from mediocre to 1 seed. I'd fucking do it again in a heartbeat if we ever got back to that 8-10 seed mediocrity."
"&gt;We tried to trade for Christian wood and deandre Jordan at the deadline but both fell through  Fine, but alleging that the Rockets were incapable of acquiring an NBA-caliber center and were ""forced"" to play micro-ball is nonsense.  That would require a GM who is fundamentally incapable of his job -- in which case, firing said GM would be the obvious solution.  Even in 1960, competent centers were not impossible to acquire, and every team in the league had at least one.  As has every team since then, and many teams have had 3 or 4."
We tried to trade for Christian wood and deandre Jordan at the deadline but both fell through
They better not let him be Christian Wood... another yiung big I liked that we had
"Tbh randle was already averaging 21 ppg, I would say that a guy like Christian wood or jerami grant deserves mip more"
Christian Wood for Wiseman is good for both sides
"Ben would perfect with your young core though, you have a stretch big in Christian Wood, an explosive guard who can create his own shot, with Simmons leading the defense that would be a very good team in a few years"
"&gt; Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Jae'Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Armoni Brooks  That team with ben simmons is still headed to the lottery, the team would still get decent draft position and have a three time all star point guard who turns 25 in july"
"Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Jae'Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Armoni Brooks"
"Dude called Julius Randle Zach Randolph. Shaq is out of touch and everyone fucking knows it. Even players like Spida and Christian Wood have called him out. At least Kenny and Chuck still keep up, Shaq is straight garbage."
"&gt; We had a winning record for a few games  Kay, so did every other terrible team in the nba... i like the Rockets but just calling it like it is here. They're borderline not even a professional caliber team outside of Christian wood"
Radical Opinion; Christian Wood  My standards are low
"He absolutely focused on project players. TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jakarr Sampson have all signed multiple NBA contracts after being given the chance in Philly.   Most of those guys wouldn’t have gotten a shot in the league otherwise"
Christian wood when he was on Detroit.
"I legit thought that for a few days at the start of the season, that they could be a play-off calibre team. Think I was guilty of watching a few Boogie/Wall highlights and assuming they were back to their best.  Tbf they had a solid defence and looked alright with Christian Wood for a while. But yeah, we've all seen how it ended up."
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
"Also MPJ 84%, Christian Wood 81%"
"It’s less about overrating Wiggins and more about not overrating Siakam like you’re doing. Wiggins isn’t even what I’m hung up on. It’s the three first round picks that isn’t realistic.   Would Siakam be better than Wiggins on the Warriors? Absolutely.  Would the gap between the two players be big enough to warrant giving up not only Wiseman, but *three* first round picks (including two lottery picks)? Almost certainly not. They can use half of that package to get a player like Christian Wood and just keep Wiggins."
They could do Wiseman + 7 for Christian Wood straight up without giving up Wiggins.
The upgrade isn’t worth giving up all that. Siakam is more impactful than Wiggins but Wiggins *combined* with whatever combination of players they can get for Wiseman and three picks is definitely far more impactful than Siakam.  For example they could trade Wiseman and one of those picks for Christian Wood straight up without dumping Wiggins. Do you really believe Siakam is a more impactful player than both Wiggins and Wood together?
That $40m is not as disastrous when your owner is willing to go balls deep in the luxury tax. Even a 75% Klay and Christian Wood gets Steph way more spacing then they currently have. And a little bit of decent vet help could shore up their horrendous bench minutes.  The team currently plays a lot worse than their talent just because of the lack of spacing. You basically can’t play any other non-shooters when Draymond is on the floor if you want to be a top NBA offense not completely reliant on Steph’s heroics. It’s basically a milder version of Philly’s Ben Simmons problem. It’s why Wiseman does not work on this team unless he becomes a real 3pt threat. I honestly do think they’re a few good moves on the edge of the rotation from being a making a drastic improvement real contender. Obviously not a 73-win team but still really good.
It’s not giving up. Giving up would be waiving him or dumping him. This would be acknowledging that he does not have as much value as he used to and realizing that Christian Wood is a good return for him that lines up better with their timetable.
And for Christian wood who just had an above average break out season? Neh I'd keep Wiseman in a heartbeat
"&gt;I get people want us to compete rn with Curry/Klay/Dray aging vir the reality is that there aren't many stars available rn, especially ones that would fit our roster.   You know you're responding to a thread discussing a potential trade for Christian Wood right?  Most fans would do that in a heartbeat.  It's a bit weird to say ""Nobody is available"" when that's literally the hypothetical we're discussing."
"Most dubs fans want to give up Wiseman.  Most of them because he was ass this year, which is the wrong reason.  We should be sending him because we don’t have time in Steph’s prime to watch him develop into a star, which is likely where he’s headed.  Either way, we’d love Christian Wood."
Christian Wood is only making $13 mil per year and could be a guy that’s available
"I'd see about giving Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, John Collins, or Christian Wood a run"
The most Chris Wallace trade would be Christian Wood and a 2029 first-rounder to the Celtics for anyone who played at Kansas
Chris Wallace? Does this mean the Lakers can get Christian Wood for a second round pick?
Christian wood
Because they've learned their lessons from not offering 10 million more to Christian Wood maybe
"For big men in 2021 with only limited ability to stretch the floor 12m seems about right. Missed half the season and put up 11/9/3 on 50/40/60 (.8 3p attempts). Steven Adams got 17m (overpay imo) Christian Wood got 13m (underpay, though with limited sample size to justify a larger deal) last year. Feels like Nurk would come in between those 2 if he renegotiated today."
Also we looked like we were on a roll there for a second then Christian Wood and Eric Gordon both went out it was pretty much tankathon 2020 after that.
Get Christian Wood or Miles Turner.  Resign Lonzo   Get good shooters
Christian Wood averaged 21/11 on 61 TS%. Blame the other teams for passing on him.  Also those Nets pick go all the way into 2027. Do you truly see this Nets team staying together and remaining healthy until then?? That’s a huge stretch to believe so
How valuable are those picks in the grand scheme of things? The nets could be good for a long time. Christian Wood has been passed around for a reason and is only there 1 more year and is about to command a lot of money. The #2 pick will be nice whether it's Jalen Green or Evan Mobley.
Christian Wood?  Our number two pick?  Our haul of picks??
ideally a big like Christian Wood
"Zach LaVine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart, Christian Wood, Royce ONeale, Seth Curry"
"Do you think Hinkie parts with Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richuan Holmes for nothing?  Do you think he gets more value for Okafor after his good rookie season...look what he did with ROY MCW.  Do you think he trades SAC 1st to move #3 to #1 to draft Fultz?"
"You could also make the case for Christian Wood (went undrafted in 2015): so far he hasn't accomplished as much as the others, but he was incredible this season before his injury"
"Yeah I’m not tryna say wiseman + 7 gets you KAT, but a starting lineup of Curry/Klay/Oubre/Dray/KAT would put them over the nuggets/Suns/jazz level.  The way I see it you shouldn’t sacrifice the future unless you have an opportunity to put yourself on par with the LA teams.  Wood is a great addition and would fit in well but they’d be giving up (obviously not a guarantee) two Christian wood level players in 3 years.  It just seems really risky when their roster has injury problems.  Steph + KAT can contend if Klay isn’t the old Klay, but Steph and Wood probably end up as a 5 seed at best."
"I get that but it’s hard to push all the chips in with such a stacked conference when Klay has been so injury prone lately.  I like Christian wood too but wiseman + 7 would be an overpay.  I think it would make sense to draft the best available player + let wiseman get minutes, prove himself, and potentially make a deadline splash if the team is in position for a deep playoff run.  If we were talking KAT id agree w that philosophy but as good as Christian wood is I don’t see him taking the warriors from really good to contenders."
"Wiseman + 7 for Christian Wood, save this comment"
"I think it might be smarter to build around Simmons. The night of that horrific 4th quarter I responded to a few comments and Indy was one of the teams I thought could make this work... but the other way around. If you're trying to shake things up and it's clear this core isn't gonna work, then why not trade Embiid. At this time he should get you a much better return than Simmons, you trade Simmons now and you're probably only getting a player that might be in that tier of players that comes after All Stars/All NBA (like a Brogdon). Embiid is always gonna be 1 injury away from being a Cousins situation. You thought you had one of the best bigs in the game but his legs just aren't holding up into his late 20s-30s. If you can trade Embiid to a team for 2 players that are in the 70 cent range to Embiids dollar, then slide Simmons into a Star 2B slot, like a Bosh situation (Bosh was a far better player, I love Bosh I'm from WNY so was always a fan due to proximity to Tor. Not comparing him to Bosh, just the Mia situation) you'd have a deep, very good team for years. You can win with a team like that. My ""dream"" trade (I don't really care because I'm not a Phi fan) was with Indy, Sabonis &amp; Brogdon for Embiid. Look at the rest of their roster... that's not a bad outcome. Sabonis is still young, Brogdon can be a smaller scorer, still have Toby, still have the depth players. You don't have one of the handful of true nba superstars anymore after trading Embiid, but is Embiid+Brogdon+Toby really gonna win a championship? Embiid for a young big and a scorer that can slot into the 1 or 2. Simmons as your D/passing player. Moses Brown and someone would've worked. Christian Wood and someone could work. Miami *could* work with Bam and someone (Nunn? Idk) if Miami talks itself into trying to relive Jimmy Embiid again only with the Mia... appeal added into the situation.  I wouldn't be shocked if Phi actually tries to trade Embiid instead. Give Simmons a vote of confidence, take scoring pressure off him, spread your scoring around, give them depth, make them younger. I might be the better trade. But of course everyone is so quick to act like Simmons can't even play in the NBA anymore so I'll probably get shit on"
"I hate these stupid takes. If anything this season has shown it has shown that it’s very possible for once overlooked talent to show dramatic improvement at age 25 or 26. As a Warriors fan you should automatically agree to this after a year of Wiggins, but there’s also Julius Randle, Zach LaVine (he’s been balling for a while now but this year was undeniable), Christian Wood, Chris Boucher, Jerami Grant, etc."
"Green is great, I see Rockets taking Green 2nd with Christian Wood locked up long term. The positional clash between Wood and Mobley would hinder Mobley's development and quite honestly Green is worth it. I'm kinda hoping the Raptors trade up to 3 to try and grab Mobley. That's how certain I am of Rockets taking Green.  That being said it makes zero sense for Detroit to even think about drafting Green 1st. Rockets will take him at 2 probably so it doesn't make sense to trade with Cleveland and Rockets have no assets that is worth trading for to drop down to 2.  Cade is a consensus 1st pick by a long shot. It'll be like the Pelicans taking Ja as the 1st pick in the 2019 draft instead of Zion, just dumb on all fronts."
"Compare their 25% to their median. Closer it is, more consistent.   Someone who averages 23 consistently and pops off 50 Bombs that bring the average up are more valuable than a Christian wood style performance"
For me Christian Wood was the surprise but to be fair I didn't watch the Rockets a lot this year.
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Green. They already got a big in Christian Wood.
What are you smoking where Christian wood is worth 6 first round picks?
"Just commented this elsewhere:   There's some reports Donovan Mitchell is unhappy in Utah. He's also supposedly a huge Mets fan, and is from NY, and may want to go play there. Could something like this happen if that is all true?  Knicks get:   * Donovan Mitchell  Raptors get:   * RJ Barrett  Jazz get:   * Fred VanVleet  * 2021, 2023 Dallas picks (from Knicks)  * 2021, 2023 Knicks picks  That may seem like an overpay from a Knicks fan's perspective. But you're giving up a guy who *might* become a star for a guy who *is* a star, plus four non-lotto 1sts. And the star you're getting is a guy who loves NY and wants to be there. A Mitchell/Randle core is a good place to be. And you're really not leveraging the future since you're giving up Dallas picks and this year's 1st, you still have all but one of your future picks.   Raptors do it to trade a win-now player for a SG prospect with higher upside (and one who's Canadian to boot!). If they draft Suggs, they'd have a sexy young core with Suggs, RJ, GTJ, OG, Pascal   Jazz do it (again, if Donovan wants out) since they get a proven win-now guard (same height as Donovan, believe it or not) that will let them continue to contend. And those four 1sts could be used to further shore up the roster via trade. Maybe you offer the Rockets Favors and 6 1sts for Christian Wood. (Would be 6 1sts since none of them would be lotto picks). That would be a significant upgrade."

"I'm in favor of a hard cap plus a ""Superstar exception"" contract that doesn't count against the cap. However, all Superstar Exceptions are the same cash per year (maybe whatever 40% of the hard cap is) and players on Superstar Exceptions can only be included in a trade if the return includes another player on a Superstar Exception.   Teams can choose to convert a Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract, but only if they have the cap space to take the contract on (e.g., they need 35% of their cap space available to convert their Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract).   You may be wondering why a player would sign a Superstar Exception when they could take 50% of the cap. But I think a team with 50% of the money going to one player is never going to be a contender, especially against a team with one dude not counting against the cap at all, letting them spend literally twice as much to build out the roster. And so no smart team would offer that kind of money, and if they did, they wouldn't win anything.  It would be like having Lebron on 50% of the cap, AD on a Superstar Exception, and absolute scrubs vs Steph on a Superstar Exception and a good roster. Like it would be something like Grant Williams / Ben McLemore / Lebron / AD / Aaron Baynes vs Steph / CJ McCollum / OG Anunoby / Draymond / Christian Wood. Spending huge on two stars may look good, but the rest of the team will be so bad, the better constructed team with just one dude on the Superstar Exception (and no guy on 50% of the cap) gives you a better team."
"The years after AI were a miserable brand of basketball that was going nowhere. They were stuck in mediocrity. Never good enough to do anything. Never bad enough to rebuild. Just mediocre. That was the basketball that I hated to watch. The team was going nowhere.  But bringing in young guys like that had potential, but hadn’t yet shown anything yet was so exciting. I’d be rooting for a big game from young guys like TJ, Covington, Alexey Shved, Elliot Williams, Christian Wood, KJ McDaniels, Jermi Grant, or any other young guy who walked through the door. These guys wouldn’t have gotten a shot anywhere else in the league, but were playing big minutes on the Sixers and playing their absolute hearts out. I’ve never seen teams play as hard as those teams because they all knew if they weren’t giving it their all, they were going to be out of the league. So the games were more about seeing these players grow than it was watching the team win. There was so much hope. These guys growing, plus all of the assets that were being accumulated that would be able to turn into real impact players for the team was so exciting. Then the league came in and put a stop to the process with the Colangelo’s and their burner accounts and the rest is history. But those games were so much fun."
"Even if we accepted the terms of your hypothetical, including the criminally underpaid Christian Wood and TJ Warren is pretty much cheating. Like anyone can build a solid team using almost exclusively undervalued players."
Here I’ll do it with out including a player being paid more than 20 mil AAV besides Ben and no rookies sound fair?   PG: Dejounte Murray - 16 Mil AAV  SG: Norman Powell - 10.4 AAV  SF: TJ Warren - 11.7 AAV  PF: Christian Wood - 13.6 AAV  C: Ben Simmons  6th Man: Jordan Clarkson - 12.8 AAV  Backup Center for Point Simmons: Serge Ibaka - 9.4 AAV
"they clearly did develop talent? see Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood(kind of), Ish Smith, Jerami Grant, Saric, Embiid, TJ McConnell  &amp; i remember point guards Isaiah Canaan, Ish Smith, TJ McConnell, MCW and Tony Wroten.   i understand you don’t like the process but what you just said clearly wasn’t true. Okafor has proven to be a bust on multiple teams, Noel never developed to his potential on multiple teams either. don’t act like this is strictly a sixers thing"
"Yeah I think he's more in the 9-22 range with a lot of room to debate.  My top 8 centers this season would be Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Adebayo, KAT, and Valanciunas. I don't think you can really put Ayton above any of them.   He's in that second tier with Kanter, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Porzingis, Ibaka, Zubac, Christian Wood, Robert Williams, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Nurkic, Steven Adams, Theis, and Al Horford.  I think Ayton is probably around the 12th-16th best center in the league, though if he keeps up the form he's had these playoffs next season I could see him making a jump into the top 10."
"Monte Morris, Christian Wood, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin (stupid), Reggie Jackson."
I would do FVV for Christian Wood. But I dont think the Rockets go for it.
Christian Wood
"Call me crazy, but Christian Wood for Wiseman + 7th?"
"Wiseman and 7 could get us Christian Wood &amp; 23 &amp; 24 from the rockets.   Siakim would probably cost us Wiggins.  Wood, Wiggins, 23, and 24 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; siakim  It’s not even close.  Foh"
"We could get Christian wood without giving up Wiggins tho.  Wood &amp; Wiggins &gt;&gt;&gt; siakim  It’s not even close, honestly."
"Would be a terrible move to give up all 3 of wiseman, Wiggins, and 7  Would be fine with oubre, but I’d still rather have Christian Wood."
Keep Wiggins   &amp; give up wiseman and 14 for Christian Wood.
You didn't even make the playoffs LOL and you're starting Christian Wood LMAO
Shit it’s better than building around Kevin porter jr or Christian wood
Am I the only one that thinks trading the same package for Christian Wood is way better.
"Yeah…that isn’t how basketball works. The system is built and adjusted around the roster, not the other way around. It isn’t some one size fit all system that can never be adjusted no matter what. If Kerr has a talented scorer at the 5 spot (something he’s never had before) then he’ll find a way to use him. He’s obviously not going to build the system around Kevon Looney when Steph, KD and Klay are leading the charge.  It really seems like you just have a Warriors hate boner and are vehemently against them improving their roster. Christian Wood will very likely continue his production next season and your comments will look even more dumb dumb."
Every good scorer in the history has “only” played 62 games at some point in their career. Christian Wood is very likely going to continue his current production next season regardless of what team he plays for and these takes will look even worse than they do today.
Christian wood.
"Somewhat unrelated, but how much more do people value Siakam over Christian Wood? Idk if Wood would cost less assets, but his salary is definitely better for our constraints"
"Yes but Wiggins is easily their best wing defender and brings consistency and a decent 3 ball. I get that siakam can do either to some respect, but I wouldn't want to gamble on him fitting with the system around Steph and klay and us having those growing pains trying to integrate another key rotation player into the roster.   I can see why they'd wanna do it, but personally I'd rather see what else is available, preferably someone like Christian Wood fits the need better as a young-ish stretch 5 for that package."
"That's true, I think he is worth significantly more than a minimum and that sounds about right. Looking at contracts it does get a little harder justifying paying a premium for such niche situations when at that price you can get quality role players like Marcus Smart, Danny Green, Dejounte Murray, Christian Wood. Granted some of those players are team friendly contracts but still."
Reminds me of Bill Worrell who retired this season after calling KJ Martin Christian Wood lile 20 times while Wood was injured and Martin is like 5 inches smaller lol
"Christian Wood is a good player, he’s not “top 10 pick isn’t enough” good tho.   As for what my fanbase is delusion about. Maybe Wisemans trade value?? Bunch of suns fans think he should be untouchable for some reason."
"Bucks fan here.  Christian Wood is an absolute scrub you should release for nothing.  After all, we did !"
There was a guy the other day that said Houston wouldn't make this trade for Christian Wood so good luck lol
Let me out my 2k hat on. Gimme capela at center (I thinks that 16mil. Moses brown as back up. Jonathan issac at PF (17 mil?) wand tj warren at sf (14 mil? ). Dinwiddie at pg at 11mil and christian wood could probably be pf and you can take warren out and move issac to sf. then a combination of lu dort and tj McConnell and shake Milton for the back court back ups I guess cause I know they have dirt cheap contracts but can contribute. Thats just off the top of my head while at work so I’m sure I’m missing a bunch of much better options haha.
"Jerami Grant $19,047,000  Marcus Smart $13,446,000  Christian Wood $13,015,000  Spencer Dinwiddie $11,454,000  DeAndre Hunter $7,422,000  Succeeding is all relative obviously when you make the rule no all stars you can the ceiling at 5-6 seed type range."
"This is a new front office with weaver and his squad. So far he’s made great moves. And weaver decided rather than paying Christian wood who would bring us more wins, to pay jerami grant and replace him with Isaiah Stewart, both of which who play much better defense than wood"
That is wild coming from a fan of team that has like 0 centers outside of Christian Wood. Thought you of all people are taking rebounds however they come 😂😂
"Off the top of my head AD (he probably declined with injury), Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Ayton, Zion, Christian Wood, and Robert Williams all would have been more interesting adds than Kevin Love. I'm unaware out of how many of those other 5 turned down Team USA.  But if I had 20 dollars to bet, I'd bet it on this being lobbied for by Kevin Love and his people with Pop and Kerr because he's got one of the worst asset reputations in the whole league, still has 2 years left on his contract, and essentially hasn't proved he can play plus basketball on a contender since 2018."
Yah I've seen what happens when the warriors send away all their first rounders in a desperate bid to win now. Would rather not have another 15 years of embarrassing teams being trotted out like in the late 90s and 2000s. It's completely hilarious you think Christian Wood would be worth all of that. Anyways have a good one
Well then we trade it away. Once again mortgaging our future for Christian Wood is beyond stupid and doesn't put us into contention. Would rather blow it up than do that dumbass trade for 2 years of Christian wood. Woo-hoo he had a half a good season after 5 years in the league. That's what we are missing
"&gt;Mortgaging our future for 2 years of a maybe above average center would be beyond dumb.   Christian Wood is a well above average centre. I don’t believe you’ve watched him very much.  Either way, with that mindset you’re resigning yourself to being okay with not winning anything for the remainder of Steph’s prime. You may be okay with that as a fan but I’d be very surprised if the front office shared your sentiment.   &gt;Wood is not putting us over the hump.   But that’s just it, you aren’t even anywhere near the hump. You were the 8 seed this year. You guys aren’t close to contention relatively speaking. You need all the help you can get.   &gt;Klay coming back and looking at least 70% of what he used to is what puts us back into contention.   I really don’t think it does. Even a 100% Klay Thompson isn’t enough to turn an 8 seed into a contender, let alone a Klay Thompson coming off both an ACL tear *and* an Achilles tear.  It seems you’re falling into the trap of both heavily overrating your young player and being overly optimistic about the level of your player returning from injury. I’m not trying to be a dick at all but believing you’re a contender next year with just Klay coming back and small moves here and there is a downright fantasy."
"Don’t need Mobley, we have Christian Wood"
So Christian Wood for Sex Land?
Christian wood is the old Luka Šamanić
When I mean the best Christian wood I mean being undrafted and being at the bottom of rotations and g league then becoming an almost all star
Mobley  His draft comparison was Chris Bosh and Christian Wood.  I’ve been switching between Green and Mobley so much it’s crazy. Thank God I’m not a GM
“Christian Wood? I’m the *only* Ty Crane.”
"Christian Wood has a 7’2/7’3 wingspan, is lean (can run) and can impact the game rim to rim.   Dean Wade is more in the mold of an offensive threat only."
"IMO he's only 25, put up an all star calibre season before he was injured, still has room to grow and develop and is on a really cheap contract. I feel a reasonable expectation for Mobley as a player is to be what Wood is now; a 21/10 stretch big with guard skills, although Wood is a better finisher and Mobley is longer and better on defense.  I don't think is would be great to trade Christian Wood just to get a guy who's probably going to be... Christian Wood. Honestly, I hope we take Mobley, I think they can coexist together, but it would take the right system and player development."
"I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but when you already have so much perimeter firepower, why not bring on another big (Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen)"
"Bro, christian wood is a lot better than oubre. Look at the the thunder, take on players and flip them. You dont turn down two lottery picks and last years number 2 pick who is far from a failed prospect in the loaded west.   Kelly Oubre is worse than Christian Wood... what are you talking about trading for more wins. Keeping Wood leads to more wins. Just bringing a basic stat of winshare per 48:  Woods: .099  Oubre: .061"
"They arent contending this year and for the next few. Christian Wood, while nice, is worth less than all those picks and Wiseman. No idea why you think they are worried about contending next year. They are literally adding two lottery picks so clearly also adds to their picks.  Oubre is a cap filler to make this work. Nothing else and prolly wouldnt make it past all star break."
"We will trade him if some established all star want out, but not Christian wood, who hasn’t proven his worth on a consistently winning franchise"
That’s way too much for Christian Wood.
LOL gutting their assets and James wiseman for CHRISTIAN WOOD???   This is an offer for Beal.  Jesus Christ some of y’all are the dumbest motherfuckers around
ok but that wasn't the intention after the trade. they tried to get john wall to play through injuries in order to win games. christian wood got hurt. eric gordon got hurt. they lucked their way into being extreme trash rather than just regular trash.  let's not do revisionist history here.
Mobley. (So we can get Christian Wood)
They could move Christian Wood back to PF. He can shoot so it's not like they'd be ruining spacing by playing Mobley and Wood together.
"Is christian wood at 25 with 2 years left on his deal a franchise building block, or valuable trade piece to get more picks and young guys? Imo it's the latter. I think you'd be selling pretty high on him too after his last season as well"
"LOL, Imagining trading all that for Christian Wood, dood is paper mache. He can’t even stay on the court. I would like to compare Wood vs Wiseman at the end of next year."
Personally I would prefer if Cleveland and Houston would kindly fumble this draft for Jarrett Allen and Christian Wood and let the Raptors take Mobley.
I still don’t understand letting Christian Wood walk but otherwise he’s been great.
"\#7, #14, and wiseman for christian wood"
"Wood is on a great contract for 2 more years that if traded this off season will net the Rockets the highest return. Rockets likely aren't going to compete for the playoffs next year, so it'd make sense for them to sell high on Christian Wood right now. He could slot in really well on a lot of contending teams."
I agree. Klay and Steph for Christian wood
They should make a package for Christian Wood  Curry-Klay-Wiggins-Dray-Wood is a championship team
"I'm not exactly sure how matching salaries would work, but would Rockets getting pick 7 and Jordan Poole from Golden State be worth Christian Wood + 23 +24?  Christian Wood helps the Warriors immediately. Starting lineup would be Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Christian Wood.  Rockets get another top 10 pick and a young promising player in Poole."
Just like christian wood? Foh
There was a post on here I believe that had a bunch of players totaling like 200-300 mil from the process Sixers lmk see if I can find it.   But I think he was responsible for Christian Wood (Rockets)/ Grant (Pistons)/ Saric Suns/ Covington (Portland)  and he signed these players to extremely team friendly contracts making them more valuable than several of the lottery players. Often including 3 year contracts with 2 years of team options
They can actually get Derozan ans still have Patrick Williams and Coby white. Markanen and a 2022 1st should be enough to grab Derozan.   Lonzo- Derozan- Levine-Thad-Vucevic   Then if I’m them I trade Coby White and/or Patrick Williams for Christian Wood
Christian Wood tbh
"Jarret Allen, Christian Wood, Brook Lopez etc."
Christian Wood in 2023
I'm so sick of hearing about Christian Wood. Do you think maybe there's a reason that he's played on 6 teams in 6 seasons?  What makes him any different than Olynyk? They both put up big stats on terrible teams.
Dillon Brooks Julius Randle Zach LaVine Marcus Smart Christian Wood
"No, he brought in shitty players. No one would want or pay for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel, or Christian Wood on their rosters to support their stars."
Aren’t you worried about the spacing with Mobley and Allen in the front court?  Also doesnt Mobley weigh the same as like Christian Wood?
They let Christian Wood walk but Olynyk gets this???
Imagine giving up Christian Wood just to get Kelly Olynyk
They both played at a very high level in Europe and you also already have Christian Wood.
"I agree that having vets is good but they’re a rebuilding team, just drafted 2 bigs, already have Christian wood, and have 2 guys in Tate and Kenyon Jr that they’re using as small ball 4s. This just seems like a deal where they’re trying to flip him at the deadline and nothing else"
I’m down for this. Can’t expect our only bigs to be two rookies and Christian Wood. Theis is good at the 4 or the 5 and is a good veteran presence.
"theis is nice. solid, average starting center  kind of a weird fit with christian wood already being there but you could theoretically run a 2 big lineup with them and not completely murder your spacing"
"Houston and San Antonio have done quite well IMO. Obviously Dwight and LMA, but also CP3 and Christian Wood basically chose Houston for their new contracts, although they ended up as trades.   Seems like the Mavs are always just a little off target, like they’re aiming 10% too high with free agents so they always come in second place."
"imo Richaun Holmes is the best player on that list, but he assuredly won't get the biggest contract. He is a really good player, but he doesn't get the attention he deserves because he plays in Sacramento and is coming off a cheap deal. Very efficient (excellent FT shooter too), excellent roll man, has this automatic little floater, can move his feet out on the perimeter and hold down the paint. He impacts the game in so many ways, he is just a winning player. Also a great locker room guy and instant fan favourite.  I think if he goes to a more high visibilty team he will get the Christian Wood treatment ""wow where did this guy come from??"" - Detroit fans will tell you Christian Wood was doing those exact things post-All Star break in Detroit. I think Kings fans will tell you the same about Holmes."
But Jaden is really young. The upside is there. I mean Christian Wood at the same age is unplayable. Jaden was balling already.
Prolly Eric Gordon and Christian Wood
"What in the world would the 76ers want from the Rockets? I don't see Christian Wood being a better fit than Tobias, just a better contract."
I think Christian Wood (and Jalen Green) will make them better than Orlando.
"Christian wood, embiid, richaun holmes and jerami grant were all good draft picks, and he signed undrafted players like covington and tj mcconell"
"Lol I’ve spent too much time on the trade machine and hoping for a Myles Turner trade involving Moody, a future pick or 2 and the “bad news bears” as salary filler. Would also be willing to do a similar trade for Christian Wood."
"Sixers reportedly asked for christian wood, jalen green and 10 draft picks for tobias harris"
I feel like Christian Wood and Myles Turner could probably be had for the right price and represent clear upgrades over Wiseman in the short term  Their salaries are also low enough the Warriors don't have to Wiggins
Christian wood?
Does Jerami Grant or Christian Wood work?
Can they wrestle Christian Wood away from the Rockets with Wiseman plus some of the drafted guys?
"For example, Christian Wood was projected to go late first round but ended up being undrafted. It took him a while, but he did develop into a quality player."
"Thats why I said long term.  Nothing about Christian Wood says ""let's keep this guy on a rebuilding team as a veteran presence.""  Not his locker room reputation, and not the kind of player he is, which is good but very specific that requires some specific types of players to maximize his impact."
"That’s debatable, we gave away so many picks for rental rights to Jimmy, moving up for fultz, even the “wins” beside Joel are like Tobias go quiet in the 4th Harris.  We shipped off current rising stars like Christian wood, jerami grant, bridges, saric, etc before they got a chance.   It’s just bad move after bad move besides joel"
"Hating Harden seems stupid at this point, he made the Rockets a contender for most of the 2010s and carried them with some trash rosters to the playoffs. Then this year they expected former league MVP James Harden to carry John Wall and Demarcus Cousins corpses and second option Christian Wood (who got injured btw) to a title? That off season was a joke, trading away Ariza for a pick and WB for Wall and a pick scream “oh we want to rebuild btw” and Harden who is still an MVP caliber player was expected to carry that squad to his final chances at a chip? The first game Harden returns he drops what 44-17 and the Rockets STILL lose to Portland, yeah, fat chance"
"I think it’s worthwhile to pause and before we say “what happens to christian wood” realize we are talking about two mid firsts.  If they all turn out to be great, worry about it later. I wouldn’t count my eggs before they hatch."
"Houston originally got it as part of the Christian Wood S&amp;T with Detroit.  OKC traded down from 16 in the draft to get that pick and and the 2023 Wizards first round.  I hate to wreck your hopes BUT the Pistons pick is pretty heavily protected.  Top 16 protected  in 2022, top 18 in 2023 &amp; 2024, top 11 in 2026 and top 9 in 2027.  So honestly you're not getting a high pick out of it and your best hope is for Detroit to be middle of the road as soon as possible..."
Do you know what a “volume shooter” is?  Here: it’s a player that requires a large VOLUME of shots to off-set his low fg% and still be effective/really good.  You think Giannis is a volume shooter getting 30pts/gm shooting 58% on 18 shots per game?  I guess Christian Wood and Dillon Brooks are volume shooters too because they average over 15 fga/gm
"He’s at the bottom tier of fg% no doubt.  So Dillon Brooks, Christian Wood, Jrue Holiday, Porzingus, are volume shooters?  Edit: is Tobias Harris a volume shooter too?"
Christian Wood dodged a bullet there
"What ""desirable"" players have the Pistons even had in the last decade? Christian Wood? So 1/1 players left that's a pretty small sample size."
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
They’ll probably wait and get some studs in FA in a year or two. Really excited to watch this team. Especially Christian wood
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
Christian wood was projected to around where we were picking in his draft. Went undrafted
"Christian Wood.  Was viewed as a super toolsy high upside project but his stock was all over the place. I remember him being a potential late lottery pick in '15, likely a late first, and ended up being undrafted."
Christian Wood
Love this draft for the Rockets and with Christian Wood in the mix they could be a fun team in a few years.
Don’t forget Christian wood
Kevin Porter Jr   Jalen Green   Jae'Sean Tate   Christian Wood   Alperen Sengun  &amp;#x200B;  Damn...
Christian wood and Sengun?
But Rockets actually have Christian Wood
Sengun + Christian Wood front court 😧😧
"Rockets literally have Christian Wood already, Perk is braindead"
"And now as a Rockets fan, we have Christian Wood and Jalen Green! Thank you!"
"A healthy Christian Wood and Jalen Green would not only make the Rockets better, but more fun to watch."
"Hayes and Cade were your own picks right? Grant was with cap space.   The only two flipped assets were Luke Kennard and Christian Wood. The Kennard trade was great for the Pistons. Wood is really good though, and I think that was a lot to give up."
"I think it actually helped those guys on an individual level. They gave a lot of players actual minutes to grow and develop against top talent, rather than sit on the back of the bench and only play 3-on-3 at the end of practice. And look at Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, even Nerlens Noel now as well. They're all doing awesome around the league"
"Rockets...that one is fair, I'll give you that. But the Wolves absolutely have more talent on their roster at the moment....Towns, D-lo and Edwards vs SGA and some young, raw project players.   Difference is, as of tonight the Rockets will have Jalen Green, who combined with Christian Wood is better than SGA...the rest of the rosters are a wash, a bunch of young guys who could be good someday but aren't anything special right now."
"If all it takes is the 7th pick (Kuminga) to get Woods, then the Raptors should try to deal players to get that pick (not our 4th pick).  I am really high on Christian Wood at his current contract."
"Rockets get 11th, 19th and 32nd picks, Knicks get Terry Rozier, Hornets get Christian Wood."
"For sure.   John Wall, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Ben Simmons and Christian Wood is winning it all."
If your best player is Christian Wood or KPJ you aren't a good team sorry they will be either 14th or 15th seed
Houston rockets get on it  KPJ Jalen green Cam reddish  Pf  Christian wood  All hype beast team would be fun to see
"Assuming we take Green, our team is gonna be super entertaining this season. KPJ, Jalen Green, Jae'Sean Tate, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr, plus guys like Armoni Brooks and Khyri Thomas. That team might not make the playoffs, but they'll certainly play some entertaining basketball."
"Hinkie joined a shit team with no future and got them Joel, Ben, saric, nerlens, tlc, mcw, Christian Wood, and some other nice pieces. If fucking collarbone knew how to do his job they would have won a chip by now. Collarboy drafted markelle and signed horford and the sixers are still a contender thanks to Hinkies Process."
"Makes sense. Christian Wood and Evan Mobley too redundant, so playing time would be a premium."
He has the same agent as capela and dj wilson. Those guys probably talked. With our recent history with bigs + already having christian wood i don’t blame him for not wanting to be here.
Jarrett Allen is nothing like what wood did  Allen is on his way out if mobley gets taken by the cavs immediately. Same can’t be said for Christian wood.
"Rockets fans are desperate. They will grab on whatever hope they see. That 50 point game that KPJ had is being used to demonstrate that he is a future super star, and I have seen quite some people treating Tate as a future star. Same as Kenyon Martin Jr. And to some degree Christian Wood."
&gt; and sample size.  Christian Wood played more games than SGA this season.
You're talking out of your ass if you think Kelly Olynyk and Christian Wood are good comparisons of value to Shai.
So you must think Kelly Olynyk is worth a top 3 lottery pick too: He put up 19/8/4 on 67% TS with Houston.  Christian Wood put up some insane numbers  too...are you giving up a top 3 pick for him as well?
“Harden for Simmons? Add two firsts and Christian Wood or I’m out”
Christian Wood
"The point is that they could have better utilized the ~40m of cap space than to sign Favors/Redick/Melli. Even if they just absorbed Crabbe+Iggy, at least they'd have 2-3 extra first round picks right now.   Sure, they needed a center, but they didn't need to spend $18m of cap space on Favors, plus a first round pick and $60m+ on Steven Adams.   You could just get a random run-of-the-mill center like Mason Plumlee for $8m/year. Or even better a budding star like Christian Wood for $13m/year."
 I can see Christian Wood getting in. Especially since the West will have a frontcourt opening with Kawhi out
"4 years from now we might even have up and coming players blossom and be better than these guys will be at that point. Like Christian Wood, Randle, Zion. AD is injury prone, no telling if he will even be healthy too"
I want to see them get Jerami Grant and Christian Wood somehow. Saw the idea on PistonsPowered. Never thought I'd want the Warriors to compete again lol.
I may be biased but I would have gone with Christian Wood.   He may have been a tank commander but 21 and 10 is 21 and 10.  McGee can’t even dream about putting up numbers like that.
The trade that needs to happen and i cant believe hasnt yet is   Wiseman + Mulder +/- #14 for Christian Wood  Wiseman goes to Houston where he and the #2 from this year will grow up together.  Christian Wood is the perfect big man for Golden State's offense and instantly vaults them to top 3 status in the West if Klay is healthy.  They would still hang onto Wiggins and #7 to use in another deal or just keep both.
"Shut up bro you dont know what you are talking about.  Pop constructed this shit show of a roster himself, he hand selected players himself.  Inviting Love over any other big man was a huge joke then when he left the team he asks McGee and Keldon fucking Johnson.  What about Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Turner, or Julius Randle?  What about Ja Morant?  He made his bed and this loss will be a huge stain on his coaching record and may finally open people's eyes to the fact that Pop is no where near Phil Jackson or any of the other great coaches.  His managerial moves are overrated as well. He directly played a hand in getting DeRozan instead of Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart which would have set the Spurs up nicely instead of watching DeRozan (thus Kawhi) walk away with nothing.  He has no idea how to manage superstars or egos in the modern NBA and was a horrible choice to coach this team. Just dumb."
They really screwed up the bigs position. Could have had Jarrett Allen or Christian Wood. I’m happy for Javale but just not it.
"It is shocking. I feel like any idiot would just do this:  leave: K.Johnson, Draymond, Grant  pickup: Trae, Zion, Bridges  There's a reason all our real best players are sitting at home. They already won gold medals when they were young and passionate about facing a new challenge. Anthony Davis played team USA ball before his first NBA game. Instead we have Trae and Zion, the future faces of American basketball, sitting at home.   Not to mention JaVale lmao.  Timelord? Montrezl? Plumlee? Jarrett Allen? Nerlens Noel? Christian Wood? Richaun Holmes?"
Coulda had Christian Wood
"Roster was certainly poorly put together. There was a lot of talent like Zion or Ja or Fox or Young that I think should’ve had a shot and would’ve added a lot to this team. Christian Wood as well wouldve been interesting. Even Jarrett Allen or Mitchell Robinson. Team is seriously lacking an inside presence and a guard/wing who puts a lot of pressure on the paint. Not really a drive and kick guy on this roster. It’s really a bummer Lebron didn’t play, I get it with his age and recent injury, but he would’ve solved so many problems for this team (not that that’s surprising he’s LeBron lol)."
Imagine if they could get someone awesome like Christian Wood though.
Lol what? Christian Wood can't shoot consistently.
Should’ve brought in Christian Wood over Javale
"No. They should have got someone better if they wanted outside shooting from the center position, like Christian Wood."
"Bam, Ayton, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Dwight, Drummond."
"Give me Jrue Holiday and Christian Wood. Jrue and Smart make for a disgusting defensive backcourt, and Wood gives us a versatile 4/5 who can shoot and grab rebounds."
Bogdan Bogdanovic and Christian Wood  We would have a lineup of Steph/Bogi/Wiggs/Dray/Wood (Klay comes back slowly and eventually overtakes Bogi’s spot) and that’s definitely one of the more well rounded ones out there
As a celtics fan id go - christian wood and brogdon as well
"Agreed. You guys should definitely send Wiseman, 7th, and 14th along with Wiggins to the rockets for Christian Wood. All star caliber &gt; superstar all day /s"
Christian Wood is coming home  /s
"They should offer Christian Wood, he seems like he’d be a perfect fit on the Pistons"
This is the chief reason that I was disappointed in Christian Wood not going. Wood've elevated him for the next season.
" Ok here’s your homework you moron, so he’s in the 50-55 range of best players.   Embiid, Simmons, Beal, harden, Kyrie, KD, Jrue, Giannis, Middleton, Randle, Trae, Bogi, Collins, Tatum, Brown, Butler, Bam, Duncan Robinson, LeVine, Brogdon, Sabonis, LaMelo, Hayward, Rozier, FVV, Siakam, Jerami Grant, Mitchell, Conley, CP3, Ayton, Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Kawhi, PG, Luka, Dame, CJ, Nurk, RoCo, AD, Lebron, Ja, JJJ, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Derozan, Zion, BI, Lonzo, Fox, KAT,  SGA, Christian Wood."
"Yes J3 and JV are good players, as was Brandon Clarke last season, and I hope he turns it around this season, but the point being made is that, as it’d be true of Christian wood and Michael? porter jr(I hope I didn’t get my porter jrs mixed up again).   All that to say tha to thd guy’s point, yes a rookie guard can successfully take the reins of a team in the nba."
"I'm high on Jalen Green and 24ppg is possible but extremely unlikely.  G league stats are inflated a lot as OP said in his reply. For example, KPJ averaged 24/7 in the g league but 16/6 in the NBA. G league defense is leagues behind NBA, so it's a stretch to call them actual NBA guys.   Also, Rockets have a lot of high volume shooters like KPJ, Christian Wood, John Wall(assuming he doesn't get traded), hell even jsean Tate is gonna put up lots of attempts. I don't think he's gonna be the 1st option and even if he is 24ppg is a big stretch"
Christian Wood doesn’t even play for Orlando!
"I responded to the wrong comment, mobile kills me.  But Siakam is not a natural fit at the 3.  Basically, we don't want him.  We don't want Dray at a full time 5 as a sacrificial victim like the Rockets did with Tucker.  We want him to live.  I'd love Christian Wood though."
I heard a podcast recently saying Christian wood is a me first guy. Just cares about his touches. Not really a team guy and locker room cancer. Can't remember exactly who it was but they were reputable. Someone in the ringer podcast world
Christian Wood
Mitchell Robinson is better than Robert Williams so why don’t we talk about him as potential top 5?  Christian Wood too.  Edit: Capela is also in that top 5 mix of C’s.
Christian Wood
"Christian Wood has started 53 games in 5 years in the league. He put up decent stats on the worst team in the league last year (much like Kelly Olynyk). If you're talking about him as a 3rd option on a playoff team, he's overrated."
Christian Wood is easily the most overrated player in this subreddit.
Clippers should trade him for Theis. Then he can play behind Christian Wood &amp; actually get some minutes.
"This reminds me of when Shaq didn't know who Christian wood was and Wood called him a ""casual"" fan to his face lol. Wood just signed a big deal with Houston.  https://youtu.be/HRGJwHh63PM"
Fun fact 6’5 PJ Tucker weighs 245 pounds the same weight as 6’8 Daniel Theis and more then 6’10  Christian Wood. PJ built different.
Ehh it matters the team and situation.   If Patrick Beverly never ended up with the Rockets when he did he probably never makes it in the nba. He got a chance to show his skills on a good team then was considered a real NBA player.    Christian Wood had the same problems just being on the wrong teams and and situations.
"I’m not even a Houston fan, lmao, just someone who looks at stuff from the outside objectively. What’s the point of OKC hoarding all those picks if he can’t even use it to draft an elite player.  Besides it’s not like OKC couldn’t have signed Christian Wood. Oh also Kevin Porter Jr. was handed to Houston for a second."
"Simmons, Shai, Middleton, MPJ, Ayton   Bench: Fox, McCollum, Siakem, Sabonis, Christian Wood     What do more knowledgeable minds think?"
Christian Wood
"Because The Process is massively, massively overrated as an example of team building. The 76ers destroyed everything and intentionally tried to be the worst team in the league year after year after year. The plan was to be bad and get high picks, and build the roster out with low-risk fliers. It’s not some revolutionary strategy, every team knows that being bad = higher picks = better prospects- it’s the strategy that Jerry Krause blew up the Bulls in favor of pursuing. What makes team-building is the ability to scout and find players who are under the radar, which the 76ers kind of did with guys like RoCo, but they mostly were bad, got lotto picks, drafted a miss, traded the miss for assets, rinse and repeat. Guys like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes were guys picked up in The Process who were let go, all players who would have been valuable to Philly. Hinkie and Colangelo’s talent evaluation was horrible, and they had no consideration for fit."
Ask for Christian Wood.
"One, DEATH ISN'T THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF COVID, HOLY FUCK DOES THIS STILL NEED TO BE EXPLAINED?  Covid can fuck you up, even if it doesn't kill you.  KAT lost 50 pounds due to covid, Jayson Tatum needed to use an inhaler for all of last season, and Christian Wood and Russell Westbrook both got smacked around by it.  Also, just because they can't die from it, doesn't mean they can't spread it to people that will. Just one example: There was a wedding in Vermont that, as a result, killed three people due to covid spreading. None of those three people attended the wedding.  And two:  &gt; instead of older white people  It's killing more minorities than white people! This has been a talking point for months!  &gt; And I say that as someone who’s been vaccinated  Being vaccinated doesn't mean you know a damn thing."
Christian Wood?
Christian Wood and SGA are definitely better than anyone on the spurs but our depth is way better than the rockets or thunder. It also seems like most people on /r/nba are assuming nobody on the spurs is going to improve even though most of the guys on our team that will get real playing time are 25 and younger.
"Christian Wood  Jabari Parker, as a 6th Man, but, he's got to keep working on his outside shot"
Nobody is ever gonna voluntarily play for Tilman Frittata unless you’re Christian Wood (???)
"I mean, I don't think ""it didn't work with a washed-up Dwight"" is argument for ""Simmons can't play with a rim-runner."" There are other kinds of non-shooting centers, though for starters Myles Turner and Christian Wood would both be perfect fits with Simmons. Also a lot of PFs who can play small-ball 5 would be good too - Jeff Green, Millsap and Tucker, at least back before they were this old, Thad Young, Dario Saric."
"He probably wasn’t even patient 0 either, Christian Wood was having flu-like symptoms when they played Utah and he also tested positive later"
&gt; I was as big as our guards. You think I’m gonna play center?”  *cough* Christian Wood.
christian wood is lighter than harden despite being like 5 inches taller
Christian Wood aka Tanksgiving
No way warriors trade 2 of those 3 players for Christian Wood. They value those picks way too much and they are honestly worth more than Christian Wood
"Okay I'm not gonna bother explaining how conversations work to you, this is wild lol.  Even more wild is that you think Christian fucking Wood is gonna fill seats when the Rockets are on pace to beat the Process Sixers. Houston had trouble filling the arena when James was balling out often over the years, ain't nobody paying to see the trash rolling in every night at Toyota Center."
"Yeah, like he's good, but he isn't THAT good. Nobody is tuning in for the Christian Wood match ups."
I’d like one Christian wood plz
Is Christian Wood really the difference maker as to whether or not people watch Rockets games though? Like the team is atrocious and getting blown out even with him.
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"

"This team is ass with no offensive scheme. Their best defensive player is a man from Rocket's Harden era who suffered a bunch of injuries. Christian Wood is arguably the only player on this team that can actually start on a real team. Jalen Green, KPJ, Sengun are couple years off from being starter level players. Kenyon Martin Jr is literally their best prospect at this moment, but coaching staff is dumb enough to only give him 15 minutes."
Christian Wood losing trade value by the game
"&gt; because he plays for a bad team in a small market  But is there a reason so many more people know about a guy like Christian Wood than Holmes? Is it just because he's two years younger (even though they had the same rookie year)?  He also played for bad small market teams, and he seems way more well known."
"Lmao love the idea but I don’t see it on the nuggets. At least not for a consistent 12+ minutes per game. He is the type of player you package for a Christian Wood, for example."
Christian wood… amazing how many ex process players who got in philly have ended up so solid around the league
"They wouldn't be the best by any means, but you could build a solid team from former sixers. A lot of the process guys turned out to be damn good elsewhere.  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Butler  SF: RoCo  PF: Jerami Grant  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Richaun Holmes, Fultz, Dario, Nerlens Noel, Iguadala, T.J McConnell, Thaddeus Young"
"Not the best, but the Hornets are pretty good:   PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Malik Monk  SF: Nic Batum   PF: Christian Wood  C: Dwight Howard  Bench of Devonte' Graham, Jeremy Lamb, Garrett Temple, Frank Kaminsky, and Cody Zeller. All in their primes, this is a solid squad."
"And Richaun Holmes, and Covington, and Christian Wood"
"Daniel Theis with the 5 TOs  KPJ with 2-11 and 5 missed open layups   Silas with the clueless coaching  Silas trick y’all man, he ain’t coaching, he just pretending to coach and smiling  Man is using Theis like he’s Bam Adebayo. He’s using him as a roller in PNR when we have Christian Wood  Wood at center should be the way.   Anywaysss, Jabari Smith JR and Patrick Baldwin Jr on the way. Need Sengun and Green to be patient, we not surrounding you with these bums in your primes"
"Makes sense he's not having a lot of success this year. Among other reasons the offense has absolutely no rhythm or cadence. These guys aren't sure how to effectively play together and Christian Wood turns into PJ Tucker just standing in a corner for 90 percent of a possession unless Silas calls a play for him.  But again, most reasonable Rockets fans will tell you the same, we are expecting to be historically bad. But we aren't worried and this team should start looking better as the season goes on, including Porter.  Also the average age of our team is like 14 years old. What do you want lol?"

"-Jalen Green coming out a bit more NBA ready than he actually is  -KPJ picking up the PG role easier than he has  -Christian Wood putting up 20/10 like he was last season  I can see how if all these things came together, they wouldn't be 'worst team in NBA history' bad, but OKC also has a history of avoiding losing"
Christian Wood is a beasg
"Players basketball reference lists as centers who take more than that per game: 17 (KAT, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Horford, Jokic, Bamba, Olynyk, Vucevic, Wendell Carter, Jr., Muscala, Sabonis, Theis, Mo Wagner, Bjelica, Jeff Green, Anthony Davis, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl)  And that's just on a per-game basis - if we did per 36 I'm sure that number would be significantly higher.  I'm not trying to disrespect Valanciunas - he's a good player - it just never made sense that people were claiming that he's a floor-spacing 5"
Same with Christian Wood
because the rockets wanted a guard to be the face of the franchise again. Mobley is so much better as a team player than Christian wood
"I don’t think you thought this through. Who to trade for? What star is available?   No, Ben Simmons is not a superstar. Dame or Beal would be the dream but they don’t want out.  Neither is KAT nor does Minny want to move on from him yet.   Another thing is salary matching, Wiggins is the only contract that they use as salary match so the guy netting in return has to be of that value.  Also fit, does that guy they trade for even fit with what they try to do?   Let’s say Brandon Ingram, ok he’s a better scorer and passer than Wiggins but they actually need Wiggins better defense and actually reliable availability over Ingram who’s a poor defender and often miss games due to injuries.  Even the lesser guys like Myles Turner and Christian Wood as names get thrown around don’t make sense.. because salary matching, and value in return doesn’t move the needle to be a significantly better team. Wood can’t defend a PnR, Myles is inconsistent and a weak rebounder. Wiggins are far more important than Myles Turner plus Jeremy lamb in return"

"Christian wood is a fucking sieve defensively. Wiseman was drafted to develop into the starting center of the future, I’m fine with letting him develop slowly and becoming that rather than making a shortsighted trade for some other random dude. I actually want to watch these kids grow into who they’re going to be"
"Imo your biggest area of need is the 5. If you’re looking for more offensive firepower I’d suggest Christian Wood. If you’re looking for a more supercharged defence you can target Myles Turner.  To be clear, you’re obviously contenders regardless. I just think certain moves can shift you from contenders to bonafide favourites (assuming Kyrie actually doesn’t play this season)."
And Christian Wood!
Christian Wood as well
"Christian Wood, Daniel Theis."
Hes better than anyone on that team not name Christian Wood. And please dont say Jalen Green or KPJ
Yeah Christian Wood was fake news
"And people like to pretend Golden State is the only team Draymond would be this good on. Clippers/Portland/Denver/Dallas/Brooklyn are all great teams that Draymond would elevate a whole lot.   Ironically, Draymond is even the perfect big to play next to KAT and for the TWolves roster. Probably would be a piece that vaults Minnesota into having a legitimate shot at the playoffs. He would probably even be helpful to the worst team in the league, Houston who has no playmaker, but few talented scorers and an athletic, stretch Center in Christian Wood."
"they need to draft better and pick up value among free agents. Milwaukee gets a lot of props for Giannis and Middleton. I would say the Timberwolves are not significantly worse than that first year of Middleton/Giannis. The problem is that it is easy to say ""sign the next Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, draft the next DiVincenzo and Connaughton, trade and long term sign for the next Jrue holiday "" but it is quite difficult to do.  &amp;#x200B;  If I were them I would target Christian Wood as he only has next year on his deal, see what it would take to get Jerami Grant on the team, see what you could get for Rubio. They really need to hit at least two home run signings.  &amp;#x200B;  If they do trade KAT they need to get a mountain of picks back and hit on almost every one of them"
"They gotta run some plays to get him some lob opportunities like the Ignite did. Dude’s a legitimate lob threat and his efficiency at the rim was sky high.  It sucks they don’t have a point guard. He’s gonna struggle a lot cause of that. Rubio was a huge reason why Ant was able to improve last year for example. Rockets run a lot of motion offence but their point guard is too low IQ to get his guys in their spots. It’s really hard to watch, they should just keep it simple, Christian Wood PnR every play"
"WORD! Bro I was at the damn game. Christian Wood had basically the same stats in the middle of the game that he had at the end. Mf just stopped playing. Everybody tryna talk to the refs. Yet everybody on here act like the coach is the only problem, holding back “talent” give me a fucking break."

We’ll trade Christian Wood for Deandre Ayton
Christian Wood chucking 3ptrs during crunch time was painful to watch. I couldn't understand what Houston was doing on offense.
"HE'S ONLY 5'1!  But seriously its been fun watching cade get better each game since coming back. Might not be the fastest, but his fundamentals are great and he still makes space for his shots.  Also loved how Saddiq was doing solid against Christian Wood who's much taller than him.  Jerami dropped what 35? Hoping the slumps over.  Killian just came back from injury and was a bit more passive than id like, though i get it.  Beef had st least 2 phantom calls on him and it meant he could get going whatsoever. Lot of dumb calls  Our bench was ass for the most part tonight"
Christian “doesn’t actually make his team better” Wood?
I’m 100% certain Christian Wood is point shaving
I believe Jerami Grant wanted to play in Detroit and that helped them move on from Christian Wood
Come on Christian Wood.   Please don’t develop this in your game to fake contact/injuries😩
Christian Wood freezes other guys out

"Lmao no. Christian Wood played like 15 games then got cut cus he’s a dickhead. Jrue played for us for what, 7 years? We made Lonzo into what he is and thought we could get similar value for way less money (spoiler alert: we did. Graham is the same guy with more offense and less defense).   This is yet another example of somebody trashing our team for literally no reason. You could do this for literally any other team in the league. In fact, this literally mentions 3 players that came directly from the Lakers who they squandered! Lmfao.   It’s nonsensical. Just more hate for literally no reason."
i mean i guess i have a general idea of how christian wood plays but i’ve never been inclined to watch his teams play lol
West Steph Curry Jalen Green Jae'Sean Tate Christian Wood Alpen Sengun  dont care about the east.  Would have had KPJ as the PG but he's been battling injuries and steph has been slightly better.
Putting Christian wood on this list is hilarious because not only did he play for New Orleans for like a month (and also played for Detroit before joining Houston) but like 3 other teams also let him go before he even joined the pelicans
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"Yeah, I was thinking ""I don't remember ever hearing about Christian Wood before Houston"""
Christian Wood got big in Detroit?   How about the Orlando Magic?   Shaq   Dwight   Oladipo    Aaron Gordon   Nikola Vucevic   Evan Fournier
"You could say this about a lot of teams.   -Jrue was drafted by the sixers, won a ring with Milwaukee   -vuc was drafted by the sixers, now on the bulls  -iggy was drafted by the sixers, won rings with golden state   -Simmons was drafted by the sixers, will soon be on another team  -richaun was drafted by the sixers and is now a key piece on the kings  -Christian wood was previously on the sixers"
They offered him the early bird rights which was 10m/yr and he wanted Houston instead.  It’s not like Christian Wood turns them into a playoff team lol Houston has the same record WITH him
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could’ve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo’s, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn’t even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let’s just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? 🤦"
"LMAO you put Christian Wood and Lonzo Ball, the highest paid 11ppg player in the league atm, in with CP, AD, and Jrue.  Come on now. AD was with the team 7 years, Jrue 7, CP 6, that’s longer than most players stick with a team."
Christian Wood was on the Pistons before the rockets. He was on multiple teams prior to Houston.
Christian Wood left Detroit for Houston.
Saying Christian Wood left to secure the bag when he was both waived by the pelicans and then sign-and-traded by Detroit after is.... maybe just incredibly inaccurate OP lmao.
"Christian Wood. Understandably nobody watches our games, but he pulled a Harden and quit on the court last night"
Christian Wood.  Wood doesn't get his shots he starts whining.  And he's a big who is soft.
"Because the team would be even better this season? Doesn't have to be a superstar, just an above average starter like Dillon brooks, FVV, Christian Wood, Olynk or Turner."
"Three-way trade, CJ for Hayward and Rozier for Christian Wood?"
"&gt;I never said that..   You said ""I like the guy but he doesn’t really bring anything to the team that most other decent centers with more height and athleticism could""  So let's break that down:  Are you claiming that BBIQ &amp; fundamentals + height &amp; athleticism &gt;  BBIQ &amp; fundamentals?  That's not a hot take. That's a given. Yes, Warriors would love to have Embiid or Jokic or KAT or Ayton. But those aren't options available.   So the choice becomes ""BBIQ &amp; fundamentals"" or ""height &amp; athleticism"". I'm saying that we saw last year that ""height &amp; athleticism"" are less useful to this team than ""BBIQ &amp; fundamentals"".  &gt;you’re also comparing him to a 19 year old lol.  I am. Obviously the hope is that 25 year old Wiseman will have BBIQ &amp; fundamentals + height &amp; athleticism.   But he doesn't right now. 25 year old Wiseman isn't an option available to the Warriors. 19 year old Wiseman is. Which is why I'm comparing 19 year old Wiseman to 25 year old Looney.  Granted, maybe you're not talking about Wiseman and you're just saying someone like Christian Wood over Looney. In which case I'd say after that 4/1/1 in 24 minutes last night I'll pass.  Warriors can ride out Looney until Wiseman becomes serviceable. It's not ideal, but it's better than the other options *available*."
Lmfao bro Christian Wood is just hassan whiteside with a 3 pt shot
"&gt; Christian Wood averaged 20ppg and nobody mentions him. He is the best player on an NBA team  No, he's the best player on the Rockets"
"Christian Wood averaged 20ppg and nobody mentions him. He is the best player on an NBA team, making him pretty damn good. Would like to see him play on the Mavs, or Celtics or just any team trying to win."
Two years of Christian Wood for the future? Bob would never.
Someone should ask Christian Wood about the matchups tonight
Yes. Free Christian Wood!  Give us young players/picks
Free Christian Wood
Did Christian Wood play in this game? I totally forgot he was on the rockets until our commentator mentioned how invisible he was
Free Christian Wood
Bold prediction: Christian Wood is gonna get traded by the deadline. Decent player but doesn't fit the timeline. Looked pretty disengaged.
People like Christian Wood are bad for business
"i think christian wood, kpj, and sengun might be legit, the team just isnt running plays for them.  why dont they run more pick and pop with christian wood when hes a good 3 pt shooting center?  just run a pick and roll with him and kpj, and you can use sengun as a bucket when you get a mismatch"
I don't watch a lot of rockets games but is that a common sentiment? I recall most people being high on Christian Wood and KPJ and Jalen Green and Sengun seem to show promise.
Crazy that Christian Wood already quit
"Yall crazy Christian Wood is a good player, only reason they arent playing him is because sengune is having a good game and rockets are trying to tank, but i bet you 29 teams would want to trade for him."
"Christian Wood complains about not being used in the offense enough, and now doesn’t even have a shot attempt in the first half"
Can you believe people were saying we should trade Wiseman and Poole for Christian Wood
"Man Christian Wood - 12 minutes played, 0 points on 0 shots, 0 rebounds, 0 assists, 1 steal, 1 turnover 2 fouls… is he just pouting all game?"
"Christian ""Tony Snell"" Wood  (nvm just realized he has a steal)"
Where's Christian wood? Watching football can't watch the game
Christian Wood is pouting for no reason lol.   Ruining his chances to get really paid
"I ain’t watching the game rn, but it’s funny Christian Wood recently complained about touches and now he’s 0/0 in this one"

Not the first time he's said something like this:  https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/Rockets-Christian-Wood-wants-more-involvement-in-16042644.php  My personal read on him is that he's more focused on his personal glory than team success.
Christian Wood is not even close to one of the best centers in the league.
Christian Wood is literally one of the best centers in the league. Wiseman will never dream of averaging 20/10
Facu had Christian Wood in the post.
Trash Rockets organization is holding Christian Wood back. He could be an all star easily
Christian wood was really good as a pistons center.
Lol he's bad. He's like short Christian Wood.
"he got locked down, it’ll be easier when Houston can run a full squad. Missed Christian Wood badly tonight"
Christian Wood is the popular answer but I think Julius Randle MIP should be gaining traction
Also on my fantasy team along with Luka Brad Beal and Christian Wood.
I can't help comparing him to Brogdon. Seems to have similar defensive shortcomings. Also seems to have a similar level of maturity.  He's got Christian Wood level confidence on the offensive end though.
For some reason I really like Christian Wood. Just seems like a guy who likes to handle his business on the court and carry on with his life.
"$8m isn't too bad a solid backup big who can give you some 20mins a night, Plumlee isn't the worst signing in a vacuum. I mean he is certainly better than DeAndre Jordan who Nets fans are already clamoring to be benched in favor of Jarrett Allen  The trouble is the Pistons decided they didn't want to pay Christian Wood, who might be a fringe all-star player, just a little bit more. Essentially it makes them look as if they picked the cheaper, worse option"
"James Hardon and Christian Wood, name a harder duo."
Christian Wood is overrated and he will cool off big time as the season goes on
Ive gladly hopped on the Christian Wood for MIP train. I’m a sucker for a comeback story and seeing that picture of him from draft night after he didn’t get drafted absolutely gutted me. Makes seeing him succeed feel so good. I’m rooting for him big time.
"Lol...  Wall - a guy that is already 30, coming off a Torn ACL and Torn Achilles, who has started off hot, but has lingering long term health issues meanwhile the team is stuck paying him max money for the next 3 years.  Boogie - Really? The guy who has played a grand total of 17, 48, 30, and 3 games across the last four seasons? The same dude who busted his ACL and Achilles as well? There is a reason was no one was lining up to pay him. Meanwhile he is shooting 40% from the field and 33% from 3. Ouch...  Wood has looked nice, but he can’t play defense to save his life, and can’t shoot the 3 (27%)   You don’t have 4 all stars, the only one who will actually make the all star team on that roster is Harden and that is if he stays on the team...  You’re team is also 12th in the West standings with a negative record...so no, you probably won’t be going to the playoffs at this rate.   And Harden isn’t gonna “stay” the Rockets aren’t gonna let him walk for nothing, he will be moved at one point.   And no one knows Zach Lavine?...lol, no one knows a 25 PPG scorer, but they know Christian Wood? Mmmmm that’s funny.  And we actually have a lot of solid young guys still developing. Most of our team is 23 years or younger so there is growing pains. Markkanen, Carter, White, and Williams are all making strides.   Also...you go ahead and tell the Thunder that picks mean nothing lol...they licking their chops ready to use the ones you gave up all for one year of Westbrook.  And you see your whole “you just gotta hope to draft a super star” isn’t that easy...and doesn’t work if you DON’T HAVE PICKS. Which y’all don’t have because y’all traded them. There is only so much a GM can do with no picks.  And my team of “nobodies” is 4-4 and higher in the standings than your team full of “4 all stars”  I know you’re probably like 15 or 16, but educate yourself on the sport before you start running your mouth. The NBA isn’t as black and white as your young mind believes and it severely shows with the way you speak."
Anything is an improvement for our C position at this point. But this guy is crazy if he thinks we would rather have plum over Christian wood lol
Really? You don't want to pay Christian Wood $10m a year but you're willing to waive-and-stretch a guy to pay Mason fucking Plumblee the same salary? Just outright criminal mismanagement by the Pistons. You don't just let young talent like that walk when their asking for a role-player level salary
Am I the only one who thought Christian Wood would commend like 15M a year?
"In this quote, Christian Wood is saying he wants to work on his defensive impact. He says communication is key!"
"Him thinking Christian Wood and fucking Plumlee should be paid the same, kinda shows the kind of gm he's gonna be. Also basically giving away both Kennard and Brown for basically free."
How the fuck do some of these GMs get and maintain jobs running franchises worth north of $1 billion? The Christian Wood situation alone is firing-worthy.
so the Pistons decided Mason Plumlee was worth more than Christian Wood. Ok then
"I have to be honest with you my man. I really didn't wanna go there, but you're insisting. We have a few young players who have potential. LaVine, Coby, Pat Williams, Lauri, WCJ, we have options to explore in terms of players who can grow. That's very exciting for the future, it means you can really only improve from here. Your team has exactly one of those - Christian Wood. Harden has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave, and your GM traded away nearly every first round pick you have attempting to make him happy. You are staring down the barrel of 10 years of darkness in Houston. I do not envy you and I hope you and the fanbase get through it."
As a big fan of harden that wouldn’t look good on his resume. He has John wall which still looks great and Christian wood who is looking like an all star if he doesn’t make the playoffs I would say it’s a disappointment even with everything that happened.
Almost as good as Christian Wood and Danuel House team finishing the 4 point oop
Did u just take a low key shot at christian wood by implying she a loser for dating him?
"Everyone's selling us in this thread but I don't know. If we do trade Harden, it will be for Brown or MPJ, and that'll be a nice young duo with Christian Wood. We won't be contenders, but I don't think we'll be going full on tank mode like the Thunder did."

"&gt; Harden has done nothing in the last 8 years to suggest he can blend well considering everywhere elite teammate has been run out of town  He gave up an absolute ELITE part of his game in the PnR last year in order to try to accommodate for Russ last year.  Do you see how good he's making Christian Wood look right now?  Like yeah, Wood is great, but he's getting so many free buckets from Harden's facilitating in the PnR that it's making him look great out there.  Also, probably not a very hot take, but he hasn't had ""elite teammates"" really any full season outside of 2018.  Houston Dwight wasn't elite, 2019 CP3 wasn't elite, Russ last year (Jan-March aside) wasn't elite.    I'm tired of people overrating how good his co-stars have been.  Outside of 2018, they have **all** been very underwhelming in their own performances while James is pretty consistently significantly outperforming them all despite getting most of the focus when he's facing team defenses."

Yep. Him and Christian Wood are two men race right now
"He's playing great, but I wonder if the opportunity cost of losing Christian Wood is worth it seeing how he's played"
Christian Wood: 3yr/41m  Jeremi Grant: 3yr/60m  Would have been cheaper to keep wood though.
Could have done the same with Christian Wood
Christian Wood vs the World
I know Christian Wood isn’t ever going to be a part of one.
"true. and i totally agree with you about Nwaba and Tate. it’s weird cuz every time i think David is gonna miss the layup he finishes, and then he misses the ones that are absolute bunnies. and i can’t even explain Tate — he’s just... he has something. Christian Wood needs to get with Hakeem and practice some footwork lol."
"Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Tobias Harris, Julius Randle  Also I think PG13 will take a small hit as well."
Probably Christian Wood. I think he’ll be good but not putting up these numbers all season
Christian Wood. I mean he might go to like 18-19 points in my opinion but I don’t think with Harden and Wall he’s gonna keep this up
"Dont really see how this is a slight to christian wood, theyre not even in the same conference"
Throw in Christian wood and a couple of firsts and I might consider it
"Lmao, it's basically just Luka and WCS lobs vs Harden and Christian Wood lobs."
Holy fuck Christian Wood can get fouls? No way
I just can’t believe Christian Wood showed NO flashes of this kind of play in Detroit. Who the hell was Detroit using that money on?!
christian wood looks like scottie pippen it bothered me for so long who he reminded me of but that’s it
"Christian Wood vs Luka Doncic, battle of the titans."
Still hate you rockets but am here for the wall revenge tour and Christian wood ball out
Christian Wood is literally AD but not uglier than a mf
Christian Wood plays like he's 50 pounds heavier than he is.. if he ever puts on that extra muscle he's gonna be elite
Christian Wood looks so smooth
"Its not just that he is a bad defender but he comes across as really uncoordinated as well. Like you can see Christian Wood is a bad defender as well, but he seems a lot more in control of what he is doing on the court.   I can appreciate Bryant's ability to shoot the ball well in streaks, but he gets absolutely bullied in the paint at times and is easy for other bigs to push around."
"Christian Wood has been straight up beastin'. Gonna be a star in this league, with or without Harden"
"Jaylen Brown, Mr. Sex and Mr. Land, Christian Wood, Trae Young"
Christian Wood
Christian Wood
They would cut that person who becomes the next Christian Wood anyways
"I wouldn’t bet on it. Christian Wood is still probably the frontrunner, unless Jaylen Brown keeps his current scoring output consistent.   Another interesting Dark Horse to me is Julius Randle. I’m not convinced that his shooting splits or his passing are sustainable, but if they stay close to where they’re at now, Randle will be an all star and in that MIP race."
"I’m rooting for Christian Wood a lot. Just knowing his story of going undrafted, playing overseas, bouncing around the end of rosters to now is pretty inspiring."
"MPJ can actually shoot and has the chance to be a generational scorer.  Jaylen Brown would also be a great option, and makes sense for both sides since that would make the Celtics title favorites.  Ben Simmons can't shoot, and isn't worth Harden.  Harden leaving also isn't inevitable. We have him for this season and the next, a lot can happen in that span. He's clearly playing well with Christian Wood, and might decide this roster has a shot at contention (which it does)."
"These are not my predictions but simply my picks right now, two weeks into the season.  MVP: James Harden (37! ppg)  DPOY: idk...Joel Embiid maybe  ROTY: Tyrese Haliburton...although I think LaMelo pulls ahead by the end of the season  6MOY: Terrence Ross  MIP: Christian Wood. Jaylen might be slightly better this year but Wood made a bigger jump from last year.  COTY: Monty Williams"
People are saying that Christian wood is a lock like there isn't 65+ games left for each team.
He’ll be a candidate but rn Christian Wood and Jaylen Brown are neck and neck and leading everyone else by a huge margin
It’s all but granted for Christian Wood to win this year.
Not while Christian Wood exists. That man is running away with the field right now
Christian wood
He is but he wont get it...Christian Wood is a lock I think for that award
Dort looks like he’s a very good player to have and is having a nice season. But Christian Wood is running away with it.
Gotta be liberal with who you put at Power Forward on that team but yeah that combination. Plus Christian Wood and Aaron Gordon my gawd lmao
"Maybe it's just become repetitive. Now that he's playing w/ Christian Wood, John Wall, and the corpse of Boogie w/ a different coach, it's become interesting again. It also seems like he kinda likes that rookie Jae'Sean Tate kid."
Dumbass we got our big man now. Christian Wood he can shoot so he can actually play.
&gt; ~~Christian Wood~~ SexLand leading that race right now   FTFY
Christian Wood leading that race right now
Hmmmm... What if the Bucks had kept Christian Wood?
Christian wood was a buck:/ I think that was before Thanasis tho
"Jokic is probably the best bet.   Christian Wood could do it but steals are a little outside his game.   Giannis is another guy that could definitely do it. Elite defender, but steals aren’t his forte either. I believe his career single game high is 3"
"Signing thanasis to a minimum as an end of the bench guy doesnt affect them in developing a championship team, its just 1 spot. How often do you find a christian wood type player at the end of the bench?"
"There's been a lot of reports of attitude problems with him. Showing up to camp out of shape, missing meetings etc. [Here's one article I found on it.](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/11/10/christian-wood-philadelphia-76ers-sixers-unlv-nba-draft-brett-brown)"
"I have John and C Wood, and my opponent this week had Harden. If Harden played last night, I would have lost this week. The Rockets winning, John and Christian Wood doing well, and Harden sitting was the best case scenario for me, and I got it. 2021 is awesome so far."
"MVP: James Harden (assuming he stays and Rockets nab top seed)  DPOY: Deandre Ayton  MIP: Christian Wood OR Markelle Fultz   6MOY: Terrence Ross   ROY: Anthony Edwards  COTY: Rivers, maybe Monty tho"
Christian Wood
Christian Wood / LaMelo Ball / Luka Doncic for all of them

"If ifs and buts were candies and nuts we'd all have a merry Christmas. In the end the chances of finding the next Christian Wood are pretty small, so it's worth more to the Bucks to keep Giannis happy than it is to bring in fringe prospects who only really play in garbage time."
Christian “30%” Wood
Christian Wood is Perfect Cell
"True, I just dont think its fair of Giannis to ask that from you and the complain about a championship team. What if the Bucks couldnt sign someone who becomes the next Christian Wood because Thanasis is taking up the last roster spot?"
Christian Wood?
Hard to take it away from Christian Wood right now
"Wood got passed over by 3 other teams. This isnt an indictment on brown.     On a separate note, both jerami grant and christian wood got lost in the shuffle in the process and are looking like stars in the small sample we have so far this year. Interesting starts for both"
"Kinda sad thinking about how excited Christian Wood was in the preseason. He was thinking, “if Harden can make average guys look well-above average, think of how he can help me (an already-above average player)!”"
"Let me tell you something. If the Rockets end this messy divorce with: Christian Wood, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Caris Levert, Jarret Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie and 5 picks, they would have done a damn good job.  I do not think that is the deal, but even if it ends up being Kyrie and a broken Dinwidde + STILL all those picks? WORTH IT."
"Fun fact: West&gt;East, Embiid&gt;&gt;Christian Wood"
Christian Wood is also older than all of the spurs young players except for Derrick white
Christian Wood is better than any young player the Spurs have but okay lol
"Idk, I would love to see a real attempt to build a 5 out offense w/ him running a high PnR or pop w/ Christian Wood, basically Milwuakee's bread &amp; butter. Oviously they would need to make personel adjustments, but for this season, Wall, Wood, &amp; Simmons would be a terror in transition if they could clean up their defense."
"I like Ingram with John wall and Christian wood, lets do it"
The say he's outta shape but he went for 44 points in 43 minutes the first game of the season scoring consecutive times in the 4th and OT. Mabye he's mailing it in or ailing from his ankle but he can still ball when it's demanded.  Almost everybody upgraded their roster in the west this year except for Houston who mostly got older slower and worse outside of Christian wood. They couldn't beat the Lakers twice out of 5 games last year in the playoffs and there's no reason to believe they would do better this year.
The only reason they are not good is that harden is underperforming. Wall seems like his old self. They have an allstar caliber center in christian wood. They still have somewhat of a depth. If harden doesnt bitch and plays like he used to they have potential.
"I don’t watch the rockets and I guess I’m biased as a blazers fans and some of the AWFUL teams we’ve put around Dame, but...how is this rockets team not good enough? Upgraded roco for Christian wood, upgraded Russ for John wall. Still have house, tucker, Gordon. This should be a competitive team. Bench is a little thin but that’s what the trade deadline is for."
"It’s so odd to me that people don’t get it. It’s just so simple. He wants to win, these guys aren’t winning a title. Being his second best Rockets team, if that’s true, it’s probably not, doesn’t matter. It’s about winning titles. Is Christian Wood and Boogie your center rotation on a championship team? No? Then you understand.   The other thing is Harden is getting old. He needs to maximize every single year he has left, not waste it on this team. He can’t afford to just waste another year for the sake of Boogie Cousins coming off two devastating injuries."
"I don’t think you understand. Christian Wood is not a franchise transforming player, but he’s a great piece on a contender. Would you want to pay him massive money in 3 years, or build around rookie contracts and field draft picks for him? Not sure you understand what rebuilding means."
"&gt; There is a lot of talent on the rockets. With a fully bought it Harden they could be contenders.  I feel like y'all are flat out delusional saying stuff like this.  In what world is a core of Harden, Christian Wood, and John Wall going to compete with a team like the Lakers?  Harden/Embiid or Harden/KD are both much better cores."
So why the hell would we throw in Christian Wood?
Christian Wood
"A good example of this is Christian Wood. He showed flashes of his ability in NO, and in Detroit, but until he was truly given the oppurtunity, he has turned into an all star"
"Who is a perennial all-star besides him? Can’t be talking about John Wall. He hasn’t played in 2 years.   Christian Wood is playing well for the first time *literally ever*.   That team had no preseason, missed games from COVID, and hasn’t gelled together once all season.   James Harden is *probably the key to the problem* but he’s also right; the Rockets aren’t a good basketball team right now."
"""Christian Wood is literally the second coming of Christ"""
Wonder how Christian Wood feels about this
"I wonder if ATL could string together something. Christian Wood, John Wall, John Collins, and Reddish? That's a pretty formidable squad for Houston.  And what East backcourt can stop Trae and Harden? All evidence suggests Capela and Harden have good chemistry on and off the court..."
Christian Wood in shambles rn
Bro don't put that evil on us. Christian Wood destroyed us in our first game against the pistons last year
“Christian wood overrated as fuck”  -harden
"Christian Wood was got for dirt cheap, which is who I wanted us to get this offseason."
"Sorry, -23 for the game (tied with Christian Wood). Yikes"
Christian Wood.
Christian Wood really reminds me of someone on the Lakers...just can't think of who
Did Christian Wood have this game circled too?
thank you Christian Wood for getting the Lakers to try some during the regular season
"he definitely has improved quite a bit, but i say it's between christian wood or jerami grant atm"
Think you can make an argument that Christian Wood is better than Wall.
"That AD game was nasty. He’s literally Christian wood with more talent and skill. It’s like seeing YOUR car on the road but with good paint, better tires, and a custom engine"
Kemba Walker  Jrue Holiday  Bojan Bogdanovic  Christian Wood  Jusuf Nurkic
"My question is why care about the Olympic deadline. The usa could field a team with players who didn't make the playoffs and do it at the same time. (although I suppose it could have an affect on ratings). Like you telling me a team lead by Beal, Grant and Lavine wouldn't instantly be the best national team anyway unless Giannis and Simmons are playing for theirs. And you still have John Wall, Christian Wood, Hield, Fox, Kat, DLo etc."
Same.  Thank christ for Jerami Grant &amp; Christian Wood.
Tbh I think the capela trade was always coming. Dude was regularly injured and had hit a ceiling that just wasn't good enough in the league. He was constantly dangled in trades. Look at how much better Christian wood has been
"I mean with the rise of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, unless Gordon was truly happy with being a forth option, or even third if Kemba gets traded, the fit was never going to be great. 3 wings is great but someone is going to have to guard tall athletic 4s like AD, Christian Wood and etc. and I don’t think that’s going to work long term."
"""What team should I play for next year"" - Christian Wood via Twitter"
"If Harden passes more the ball, Wall and Cousins play at the same level they were playing before injuries, and Christian Wood plays out of his mind I could see them losing in the second round."
"It's easy now for people to say ""How was he not drafted?!"" but tbh I didn't have much of a reason to be drafted back in 2018. I was 24 years old, didn't even start most of my senior year and averaged like 8 points a game lol. I felt like I was capable of more and also felt like I had a translatable skill but understood why GM's/front offices wouldn't take me. There are other undrafted guys (FVV, Christian Wood, Knunn) who are more head scratchers to me..."
"Yes, but make no mistake, Christian Wood is a hustling bustling solid ass player, he can only get better from here 🙌🏽"
This is probably the worst Harden Rockets team in a long time. John Wall can't do anything but drive into a packed paint. The paint is packed because there are no threatening shooters on the team (maybe except for McLemore). Harden's either washed or acting like a pathetic diva (either is bad news). Christian Wood just pads his points and does little else (dude only had 3 rebounds as a center!)
"Christian Wood is listed at 98kg / 216lb, Gasol weighs 116kg / 255lb. Dude fightin 4x above his weight class"
Grant for Christian Wood and a FRP.  Who says no?
"Hahahaha oh I love that you're going to tell what the process was about. A Lakers fan who tanked just as hard the same time, had a simila record over those years as you desperately tried to keep the pick you owed the sixers. But got ZERO criticism because they claimed to be trying. So your team was rank incompetent, and just happened to be lucky enough to keep the top 3 protected pick you owed. Or you tanked too, so STFU. Meanwhile the sixers drafted and developed a number of players who are establishing themselves. Grant and Christian Wood being the latest examples. Which was the point of the process. To give time to players who could become something instead of mediocre vets that just lead nowhere. Even in your little dumb note you clearly don't understand what the process was. If you think process = tanking only you're just dumb and should still to cheering for your free agents. Don't tell us what Philly fans wanted and at least be aware your team put just a shitty a product on the floor and got zero grief."
man... get Christian Wood some help
"Hard to say from one game, but I think AD is slightly better than Christian Wood."
"Anthony Davis is Christian Wood lite, /s"
   Christian Wood after the game gonna shave a brow off to be like AD.
"no cap, christian wood is very good at playing basketball"
Christian Wood a bum. Get his ass in the D League
Anthony fucking Davis heard y’all comparing Christian Wood to him.
Happy for Christian Wood for balling out and his confidence. But why he had to announce he had this game circled on his calendar?
"No, nobody has said Christian Wood is as good as AD  People have said he plays like him, people has said he works to imitate him, Wood as said he’s excited to play against AD  Big difference there bud"
So is this AD clone known as Christian Wood ever gonna show up since he had this game circled on his calendar?
We also roll out a bunch of guards and very small forwards and Christian wood.
LeBron and AD have Christian Wood in HELL lmaaaooo
Ad took offense to the christian wood comparison.
"Lebron is 18th in free throw attempts per game. AD is 53rd. Harden and CHRISTIAN WOOD are 7th and 32nd, respectively."
"Christian Wood 'circled' next two games vs. Anthony Davis, Lakers"
Tonight Christian Wood faces perhaps the best defender in the league.  Hes currently averaging 23/11  What do you think he averages tonight?
Interesting I like the Mavs but they’re probably the least deep team in the pack. I think with a healthy porzingas they’d be a dark horse finals pick. But Wall looks Great harden is playing half speed and is still the  best pure scorer in the league and Christian wood is a revaluation. I think this is the best rockets team since 16’ to be completely honest. If they go on a run idk who’s stopping them. I’m shocked with a rockets flair you aren’t more bullish.
Now imagine if he had Christian Wood instead of Mason Plumblee
No? Christian Wood &gt;
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood currently both fit the unofficial criteria/precedent as the fringe starter/role player that blossoms to become all-star calibre in an expanded role.
Idk Enes Kanter averaging a double double off the bench and Portland is right in the thick of it all so he my pick for 6MOTY   MIP I gotta say Christian Wood if he keep it up bc I’ve seen that kid make shots so far that i never expected n he putting up good numbers but I do believe Julius Randle is another contender if he too continues his stellar play as of late  MVP is tough but im leaning towards JOKIC . . . he got most triple doubles already and clearly best passing big man in the game...idk i just love big honey so much and he seem to be playing elite ball so i think he got a shot...  DPOY Andre Drummond perhaps? and I hope Myles Turner makes all defense team
"But he has the narrative advatage because his other contituents have been in the playoffs and have good teams (Embiid has Simmons, LeBron has AD, Kawhi has PG) while Curry has to carry a bunch of scrubs.   If we are talking about a superstar that has the least anount of help but still has a passing record (.500) its between Luka (KP will probably be back soon) and Curry (possibly Harden if you don't consider Christian Wood and John Wall as secondary all-stars)"
"With Christian wood as well, there are a lot of good candidates for most improved this year"
We should trade Ad for Christian wood
Steph MVP Lamelo ROY Clarkson 6MOTY Drummond DPOTY - yes this one is wild but hey we’re here to have fun right? And Christian wood as most improved obviously
"Christian wood, jaylen brown and Zion"
"Christian Wood was always a bucket. I knew this watching the pelicans circa April 2019. Just now teams are giving him actual minutes to produce, and he is. Go figure"
Dude I just saw Ish Smith drop 9 against the heat.   But seriously Jerami Grant is nice. Add is RoCo and Christian Wood and they probably pull it off.
"Rafael Stone turned RoCo into two picks and Christian Wood, which is a huge W. Then he turned Russ into Wall and one pick, which has looked like a W so far. I don't know how you can say he's been a bad GM, especially since he came from nowhere.  Again, good luck with your tank!"
Christian wood and James Harden have a real shot at hitting this
I don't trust him after he cut Christian Wood. lol.
BI and Zion are too good to be having to deal with this lack of spacing. They can both score at the rim at will. BI's mid-game is ridic but we haven't gotten to see it that much. The fact that Christian Wood got cut by Griffin makes this all even more absurd...
Really Gasol should only come in when boogie comes in against the rockets.  Christian Wood isn’t the big body bruiser that AD dislikes playing against for 82 games. So AD at center hopefully.

"Oh you want tall and athletic? I understand. Forget about Christian Wood, take a look at this fine specimen here, Bruno Caboclo. We'll gladly take Hayes off your hands for this guy."
Who is front runner for MIP between Christian Wood &amp; Jerami Grant?
"He's definitely the best player of the bunch, but he also already was the best player last year by a decent margin. Compared to Randle who was reckless and despite his stats most considered a very negative contract. Then you got Christian wood who was only a starter for like 8 games and now he averaging like 24/10"
"Had one guy tell me it's because he's too lanky to count on for rebounds, which, uh... not like Baynes and Len are getting a ton of those. And as much as the Rockets are off to a rough start, Christian Wood is working out pretty well for them."
Christian Wood is just AD if AD were good
Imo Christian Wood. The jump he took was bigger than Jerami’s. Jerami is mostly because he has an expanded role.   Wood truly came out of nowhere
John wall 😎  Christian wood 😎
John wall 😎  Christian wood 😎
That's one Christian Wood and Domanatas Sabonis contracts.
"This is it. Nobody knew who Christian Wood was at the start of last season outside of die hard NBA fans. This guy is acting like it was a foregone conclusion that Christian Wood was going to break out. The Pistons gave him a shot and he capitalized on the opportunity, nothing more nothing less. If it was such an obvious breakout, why didn’t your blazers pick him up?"
Why is Christian Wood so perfect?
I don't think handicapping the spacing is something that would help Zion's development. And guys with Christian Wood's talent are extremely rare especially on his cheap contract. He's not the type of player you can just go out and easily sign in 3 years. And honestly I think trying to compete for the playoffs and getting experience in meaningful games is pretty important too where Wood helps a lot in that aspect.
"Agree 100%, many players that bounce around like Christian Wood in the league usually has the apparently ""attitude"" problems but most of them do not actually self improve even though they have the athletic gift. A good example off the top of my head is Marquese Chriss. Early in his career he thought he was the man because he was a lottery pick and his attitude problems often showed on the court. He's been on 6 teams now in 7 years and it look like he hasn't improved at all."
Christian Wood gives your team a way better chance of competing in the long term. That would make a legit big 3 with Zion and Ingram. He would also help their development by spacing the floor way better than Adams. If you want a locker room presence vet guy just sign one on a cheap contract instead of passing on star level young talent.
"There are some problems though. Grant is a very solid defender as well, and Christian have been fairly poor for most of his career. Christian is also playing perhaps the most important defensive position. I just don't think you can be a real contender with Wood unless very specific teammates or he's something special on offense like Jokic.  I'm not hating on him, I really enjoy watching his offensive but he is a fringe all-star level player offensively and way below defensively."
Statistically? Christian Wood. Playstyle? Jerami Grant or Darius Bazley  I think Anthony Davis is a rich man's Marion actually.
"Contextually, Rockets were missing half of their team for the first two games and only lost by a couple of points in OT to the Blazers.   CJ McCollum torched the team. Then the team's front court with skinny Wood got manhandled by Jokic.   They beat the Kings twice at home with Harden sitting out the second game after stepping on Wall's foot on an inbounds play.  They lost to the Mavs. Tim Hardaway Jr. torched the team with nine threes.  Harden looked a bit off with his ankle.  Against the Pacers, Brogdan had a career game and the Rockets couldn't play Christian Wood (bruised knee from bumping it in the Mavs game) or House (back spasms).  5 different starting line-ups in 6 games so the teams working out kinks."
"Lol, uh defense? Christian Wood is not good at defense."
Christian wood was not developed by the pistons. He already showed the jump in numbers before they got him.  The only entity that deserves credit for Christian Wood developing is Christian Wood.
"a lot of it was that he hoarded second round picks, so that helps with the hit rate. Christian Wood they didn't develop, that was the Pistons doing. But trading Grant was really dumb, one of those classic 76ers moves of ""this guy is going to need a raise and we don't want to give him it"" decisions"
I get that everyone loves to shit into the pistons but the guy who wrote that Christian Wood article literally changed it and took out stuff like the 8 mill. There's so many other things to criticize the pistons for but that's not really one
"So the years where Giannis didn't make it from the Bucks, he probably doesn't make it from the Pelicans either; which means 2012-2013 (he wasn't even in the league by this time btw), 2013-2014 (rookie) are out.  Giannis and AD both made the playoffs 2014-2015 so that's a wash.  2015-2016 Giannis still ain't the guy we know him as now (he was also way worse than AD until here) so he doesn't make it then.  2016-2017 is when it starts getting interesting for Giannis, but I don't Giannis makes it to the playoffs. This was when Cousins got hurt and played less than 20 games. It wasn't about how good they were, it was heartbreaking as fuck and massively demoralizing. The team wasn't very good anyway without Cousins (Jrue was the only guy I'd consider good, and Omri was okay I guess).  2017-2018 they both made it so it's a wash.  2018-2019 is the only year I think Giannis COULD have made it to the playoffs instead of AD. This was the year AD wore the ""That's all, folks!"" shirt and played like a 48 year old injury-prone center. If the league didn't step in and threaten the Pelicans, AD probably would have played less than half the games. The team was bad, but not THAT bad; Jrue, Randle, Payton, Mirotic (inj) Christian Wood, were all good or serviceable at least. They had decent bench, good offense and decent defense for a team ranked so low. Meanwhile Giannis was a one man wrecking crew at this point, garnering his first MVP, and leading the Bucks to the 1st seed. IF Giannis were to make the playoffs more than AD, this is the only year he could have imo; and I think he may have made it. Not 1st seed or anything like that, but maybe around the 4th or 5th seed.   He wouldn't get past the first round anyhow, but hey, at least he had much better chance at making the playoffs than AD that year.  TL;DR: Giannis could really only make one more playoffs than AD imo, and that was in 2018-2019.  important edit: The thing is though, I don't think Giannis makes it to the playoffs in 2014-2015 so the overall count is a wash."
The original Christian Wood who used to play for the Pistons.
"hold on  &amp;#x200B;  how?  &amp;#x200B;  Who on his team was better than who the Warriors had? Just because your guys weren't playing well doesn't mean that they weren't better than who Harden had.  &amp;#x200B;  Post-achilles, 2 year layoff Wall, undrafted Christian Wood, completely washed Cousins, Eric Gordon who's been shooting sub 30% from 3 for 2 years, and 36 year old PJ Tucker are supposed to be better than Draymond Green, Oubre, and Wiggins?  &amp;#x200B;  like, you're using an extremely small sample size and drawing some fuckin weird comparisons from it"
Actually Christian Wood was balling on the Pels down the stretch after we acquired him and I was very confused and disappointed that we cut him over guys who clearly weren’t quality NBA material like Jahlil Okafor
The move made sense at the time. No one expected this leap from Christian Wood.. not even you.  The pelicans will be alright.
"Christian Wood is definitely a shooter, 36% on near 5 attempts a game is pretty good for a big man. And we certainly do have a problem with guys not hitting shots, and Christian Wood would definitely help with that as opposed to Steven Adams. To say he fixes nothing is just plain wrong, he's been great this season on the Rockets."
"Second season and he’s already made plenty of mistakes like cutting Christian Wood before last season despite Derrick Favors being our only good Big man on the team. The other options were Jahlil Okafor, rookie Jaxson Hayes and Niko Melli 💀"
"Chris Boucher.  Lu Dort offense  I already knew Jerami Grant, Christian Wood and Wiggins would be this good tbh."
Mainly from an offensive perspective is where the comparison stems from (literally just skill set and play style)   Obviously AD is in a different league as a defender and Wood hasn’t peaked yet as a defender either. I do think Christian will become a positive defender later in his career. Man just needs those games/reps/run under his belt and the common errors/being out of position/ getting lost on D that kinda stuff will go away
&gt; but he's definitely an above average starting caliber center in his prime.  How? He's basically been the same player from the 2018-2020 season and had another bad start this year. He played well the last two games against the blazers missing their starting 4 and 5 and the rockets whose only big men were PJ Tucker and Christian Wood.  He's a good backup big for his career in my mind.
christian wood is MIP so far
I would think Christian Wood or Jerami Grant is MIP favorite atm.
"MIP? Over Christian Wood or Chris Boucher??? Come on now, sir."
"Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Lu Dort are all front runners IMHO so far, but we’ll see how if they can keep it up."
christian wood?
Add Christian Wood
"Hmm as good as Dort has been he’s not really even close to Christian Wood, Jeremi Grant or Shake Milton IMO"
I picked Covington in round six. I also picked Christian Wood in round seven. It has been a very confusing experience.
"I would say Christian wood has been the most surprising player and has a good shot at winning most improved player, as for most surprising player that is under performing, I would say it’s Trae young. Trae is good but his stats from last year compared to this year... well hasn’t been what I thought it would be. I know it’s been a few games but hoping he can go back to avg close to 30 points per game. 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽"
Tacko Fall &gt; Christian Wood
"But I guess that's where my question is. If big man offense is mostly PnRs, and Wood gets almost all of the PnRs, where is the new C going to play on offense? As far as I know, AD doesn't play as heavy of a role as the roller in PnR, leaving some space for a fellow big to contribute offensively. But I'm not sure that space would be around with Wood.    I agree that Wood's defense is a problem right now. He's working to fix it, but it's entirely possible he never gets good at it. I'm kind of looking at the problem opposite to you. I'd love to get a good stretch 4 that can guard bigs and take shots to play with Christian rather than making Christian the stretch 4 and adding a C. Think it would help a lot offensively. But I don't have a guy in mind who might fill that role."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jx4a73/making_sense_of_the_houston_rockets_moves_so_far/  I literally did. Also there were plenty signs of tampering. The deal being made shortly after FA opening, the Rockets spreading rumours that they werent interested heading into FA and instantly signing him shortly after to try to get rid of suspicions. Christian Wood leading up to FA liked a lot of posts on social Media from Rockets fans that wanted him to be signed"
"I would say that the Rockets run a lot of their stuff with Wood in mind. I mean he is a key player. Boucher doesn't get anything run for them. He was never meant to be a *huge* part of this team just a solid guy.  That is very impressive to assert himself to the level that he has these numbers.  With that said, Christian Wood but the season is young things can change but Wood for now."
"Dude is good. Real good. And I like him. Which is why I hope there aren’t more post like one from earlier saying stuff like “Who is Better, Christian Wood or Chris Boucher.” Once people start overrating players it gets annoying and I eventually just stop liking them. Any contender would want him tho"
"This isn’t even close bro. Just don’t. No one in their right mind is taking that wood scrub over someone named Boucher. I *gaurantee* Chris would be a better water boy then Christian. In all seriousness, I don’t understand how anyone could say Boucher. Wood is already clearly better and four years younger. Some people are mentioning the contract situation as if Wood isn’t on one of the best contracts in the league."
"As far as role player maybe, but hes got a while before he even touches Christian Wood level on that end"
Ah I see.. ok then yea Wood is for sure better based on what we have seen. Not to mention but Christian has somewhat of a handle too and can go coast-to-coast etc  Wood to me is a mix between a wing and a big.
"Wall is 30 and paid way too much, Boogie is 30 and a shell of his former self. Oladipo is 28, on an expiring contract, and probably wants to leave this offseason or get paid a ridiculous amount. PJ is 35 and only has another year or two of good play left in him, is on an expiring, and wants to get paid.   If your money is tied up in Wall/Oladipo/PJ plus Boogie you're not going anywhere. Not a ""great big 3"" at all. They're probably not even a playoff team despite guys like Christian Wood. They're 4-8 right now and these players aren't getting any younger.   Their best move is flipping PJ, Oladipo, etc. for whatever young guys or picks they can get, tanking until Wall's contract expires, and then rebuild from there. In the meantime you overpay Wood to keep him happy and try to develop your younger guys.  So I could totally see the Wolves or whoever get PJ. Don't know if it'll save the season though. Once KAT is back, who knows. The West is super stacked."
"I would go with Wood. Also, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like the MIP race is between Christian Wood and Jerami Grant right now. Grant is killing it despite the fact that the Pistons have been bad."
"Christian Wood and a big reason why is because Wood is 25, Boucher is 28..."
"If Christian Wood evolves into Anthony Davis, then Boucher's next evolution would be Christian Wood."
Going from Clint and Christian Wood to old man DJ probably is gonna take some getting used to
They lost this game lmao. I think they have some great players but definitely not underrated as a whole. It was basically the Oladipo show all night with bits of Christian  Wood but even then the majority of his baskets were off of Oladipo dishes. Will look a lot better when John Wall comes back though.
the next Christian Wood
I think Christian wood got the MIP on lock
And what do you do with John Wall a max contract PG/ballhandler? And Ben once again crowding working space for Christian Wood?
"Darius Garland,  Jordan Clarkson,  Jerami Grant,  Christian Wood,  Chris Boucher."
The eastern conference version of Christian Wood.
"&gt; Pistons: plays him after trading Drummond and balls out  I've been wrong about a lot of Pistons things in my life (thought we got too little for Stackhouse, thought Chauncey would just be Super Atkins, thought Darko was the final piece) but I'm proud to say I was all about Christian Wood from the moment I saw him in the 2019 preseason.   Granted, at first it was mostly just because I loved that he dunked like he was angry at the rim but over time, he really seemed to have a positive effect on the action whenever he was out there. I swear the Pistons were better with him on the floor than Andre even before he started eating up playing time post-Andre.   I'm pretty bummed Detroit couldn't hang onto him. Glad Jerami's doing well at least though."
Christian Wood is actually fucking the league rn what the hell
Christian Wood is good
"Christian Wood is definitely the front runner for that, but Boucher would be 2nd in my books and the front runner for 6th man of the year at this point."
"Injured guard John Wall yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Christian Wood gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Eric Gordon yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Oladipo hit  locker room door, former NBA great DeSagana Diop hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Christian Wood looks like some player i created in nba 2k18
What about Kyrie for Christian Wood?
Harden still aiming those passes at Christian Wood. DJ barely have any lift
Yeah we played the Blazers who are missing their starting 4 and 5 today and the rockets whose only big men were Christian Wood and PJ Tucker the other game.
"I honestly dont.  Prior to his signing, Christian Wood was liking posts of Rockets fans asking for his signing all over social media, this looked like a real gamble from the Rockets at the time.  The Christian Wood deal was signed hours after FA opened  I really think there was tampering there."
"Even keeping Harden, Christian Wood was a much better fit with him, and the Rockets got 2 FRP's"
Even then getting christian wood and two firsts is better
"It really does sound like Tillman was trying to, or did, stick it to Morey. Simmons + whatever already seems better than what the Rockets got. Sure, picks in 2027 when Harden/Durant are gone or aren’t good enough to tank picks anymore might seem like a good way to rebuild. But another pretty good way to rebuild is with Christian Wood, Ben Simmons, and whatever other guy(s) they would’ve gotten, like Thybulle or whatever."
"Yeah, pretty sure KOC circulated a rumor that Oladipo wanted out of Houston ASAP yet Vic just put out a statement that he's excited to build with Christian Wood and his new team in Houston.  I would take what he says with a massive grain of salt. Dude is a clout chaser straight up."
"&gt;Whenever a team trades a top 5 player or a star, they never get back something equal or better. Houston was not going to win trading Harden matter what. We'll see what their new GM is made off and see what he does with all those picks. We will know for certain a couple years from now, I'm not going to automatically say those picks won't turn into something.  No, you can't expect to get equal value, but a player of Harden's caliber should return 2 of young talent, locked up established talent, and picks. They got a butt load of picks and essentially a salary dump because Oladipo isn't sticking around. Durant, Harden, and Kyrie are 32, 31, and 28 and playing at an extremely high level. There's more reason to believe Brooklyn will be a competitive team for the next 5 years than not. The likely scenario is those picks are in the 25-30 range. If they are not, something lucky happened (someone leaves, injury). There's no reason to suspect those picks will be super valuable. So what does Houston have to build with now? Christian Wood? It was a bad, bad trade because so much has to go right for Houston for this to work out. It's like tanking and hoping you hit gold in the draft. There's no real plan.  &gt;Back to Simmons, he's about to be 25 not 20. When is he going to learn how how to shoot, at 30? This is a big red flag especially in the playoffs. I would take a lot of other young stars in the league over Simmons, he would be at the bottom of my list. Simmons is what he is, I don't think he's going to show more improvement in his game.  I don't think anyone would argue he's about to 25, not 20, that's how age works. Simmons has played fine in the playoffs and Philly was a bounce and OT away from the conference finals a couple years ago. Look at how Philly played last year without him. I can fully agree that he might be a lot closer to his peak than most 25 year old players. But hey if he's peaked, you still have a top 25 player who can help on both ends of the floor. If he develops, great. If not, you have a piece that will help you contend for a championship. Free agents will be a lot more attracted to join a team with Ben Simmons than late first round picks."
"[Christian Wood does it too, it just doesn't work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kus1ud/highlight_christian_wood_tries_to_bully_marc/)"
"4X All Star, 2 time 2nd team All NBA, Demarcus Cousins tho??  If we’re going by accolades...  Christian Wood is averaging 23 &amp; 11 btw."
Christian wood has been a pleasant surprised
"Christian Wood.   Who has the most potential?   Mason mf Jones or Christian Wood.   If we don’t flip dipo we’re still a solid team that has a good shot of making it to playoffs.   If we do, we’re getting goodies and who knows."
"Spurs Fan here, Christian Wood been killing us this season on both ends"
Honestly mines probably very similar to this. Except idk about Gobert. I think he will have some competition with a guy like Christian Wood. Obviously if the Jazz has a good enough record it’ll be Rudy. But with the east it’s hard for me to say that Ben Simmons and no raptors make it. I know the stats and the raptors record but still hard for me on that one
He said Christian wood lol
"LeBron, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Christian Wood, Stephen Curry"
&gt;draft class  3 FRP— 2 of which we’re very expensive— and you only get 1 future starter and he’s a 3 and Der. That’s a disaster.  We didn’t lose Christian Wood. We weren’t going to sign him in the first place.
"1. You were talking about **draft class**  2. The 4 2nds are overrated value since you can get good undrafted players (many examples to point to), the future first was extremely heavily protected, Bruce Brown is hardly playing minutes, and Luke Kennard got a huge extension.  Like of all the things you could have mentioned, you didn't mention Christian Wood..."
What has kept us in a lot of our cold shooting games this season is simply the TO difference and this was no different. For such a young core of ballhandlers we have turned the ball over surprisingly little.    Christian Wood was great. He showed he's okay being your main weapon but a lot of the stuff he does is going to translate when theres more weapons beside him.
Mikal Bridges Jaylen Brown Christian Wood SGA Jerami Grant
Christian wood?
"Yeah I mean I’m not saying they wouldn’t have a case. But for me I look more at a guy like Christian wood or jerami grant. Who are players we’ve known about for a little bit but because of a different situation or role their game has went up a ton. You look at Ja, Zion, and even herro in the bubble we already know they are capable of some big time stuff. Zion and Ja showed they can be all stars. Herro has shown that when he’s hot he can score at will. I just think that because we know what they’re capable of we already expect higher"
Christian Wood
Christian Wood
"Shake Milton is a homer pick, but his PPG has gone up 7, his assists have gone up, and his defense is much better. He’s got a solid argument as the third best player on the team at this point.  That said the objective pick is Christian Wood."
Christian Wood has been playing like a top 5 centre in the league. Exceeding every expectation Rockets fans set

"I mean he's as good on offensive end as Christian Wood, just look what one is averaging and what is other. Collins being limited to 11FGA which is less than both his sophmore and 3rd year is pathetic."
"Yeah this is it.  Collins needs to learn how to operate in a crowd and has to be able to efficiently put the ball on the floor for 2-3 dribbles to attack strong.  2-3 moves that he can use in that 15 foot ish range and in would change his life too from a financial standpoint.  Right now with Capela not only are his simple PNR/P opportunities limited, they’re less efficient with capela in the lane. There’s nowhere for the ball handler to go with two rolling bigs makes coverage easy.  People are imagining he’s a Christian Wood kind of piece offensively when really he’s a rookie Anthony Davis that can shoot the 3 ball."
Jarret Allen didn't just fetch Mil's first round pick in 2022. It was Jarret and Taurean Prince for Exum and the pick. Taurean is a bad contract and still has two years remaining; it would have probably taken a late first round pick just to dump his contract.   The trade gives Rockets salary flexibility for summer. They can use the cap space to sign a promising young player in the offseason (similar to Christian Wood). Talen Horton-Tucker could be a good target.
I love Christian Wood. Such an underrated big.
Nets are better but tf they gonna do to Christian Wood lol
"No more praying for Eric Gordon to make a basket, hoping John Wall and Cousins knee's will stay healthy or if Christian Wood is going to show up against a big that actually plays defense. He got a top 3 player with him and another top 15 player coming soon."
"We get this regarding Christian Wood too  Sure we definitely could’ve signed both (what I wanted), but Wood didn’t wanna stay here.   Like Jerami he did what he thought was best for him, can’t ever be mad at that."
MIP is gonna me between Christian Wood and Jerami Grant and I’m proud if either of them win it
"If I'm Shake or Christian Wood, I would fake going insane, get my contract terminated then go sign for my market  value"
"Christian Wood is a dude I wish the Bucks could have kept, but he would have out grown being a bench player behind Giannis and Brook very quickly"
You smoking crack bro that team loses in the first round. This sub overhyping the fuck out of Christian Wood.
Christian Wood happened. LMA was getting torched nearly every time they matched up in both games.
"Christian Wood is, Jewish wood isn't."
i dont want to see christian wood again in my life
Where were you when Christian Wood saved basketball?
"Christian Wood and Mason Jones, the duo I hope we never play again"
"Random, relatively unknown player bursts onto the scene due to great improvement. Fans get caught up in the improvement and consequently overrate the player relative to more familiar, well-known players of similar skill levels.  Happens all the time. This year it’s Christian Wood. Caris Levert is a fine player, but claiming the Rockets got “robbed” is ridiculous."
"True, but it doesn't even have to be a star. It could be like a Jerami Grant, a Julius Randle, a Christian Wood.  If the Nets have cap space they could also take an overpaid slightly over the hill player like a Horford. Also you're not relying on no good FA in 2022, it's no good FA every single year. The Rockets don't want like a middling pick, they want a lotto pick. You need to be really bad to be in that range. Also keep in mind there will undoubtedly be teams outright tanking to get lotto picks."
Christian Wood and Mason Jones
"He averaged 20-8-7 and played 1st team defense last year with bad shooters, no other playmakers and without Embiid.   That's a better guy to build around than Christian Wood and the 15th pick lol. Unless of course you think otherwise!"
For those who don't want to click:  1. CJ McCollum  2. Malik Beasley  3. Christian Wood  4. Darius Garland  5. Malcolm Brogdon

"I'd say he often didn't have the sort of impact you'd expect from a guy averaging 17 &amp; 15. I'm sure someone else who's more familiar with advanced statistics could chime in but I feel like there was a pretty stark contrast between how good the Pistons were with Christian Wood on the floor last year versus what happened when Andre was out there.   At many times, it felt as though the Pistons were sort of held hostage by Drummond's limitations. 50 percent free throw shooter, virtually zero offensive ability outside of lob dunks and tip-ins, and a motor that would come and go. Worse, the Pistons would still give him post touches and he always seemed to be looking for an excuse to take off with a live dribble, attempt a 3-pointer, or whatever else came to mind but was comfortably outside his purvey.   I think that's how he often ended up muting his own impact. So many games, you'd be happy about some of his key tip-ins but then you'd be forced to acknowledge that he also committed two really bone-headed fouls late in the shot clock in the backcourt or insisted on getting his post touches only to force some really ugly looking jump hooks, or moped after a bad possession and failed to get back leading to a four-on-five and open 3-pointer, or he'd just not be super responsive to weakside rotations.   After all that, since nobody really watches the Pistons, there were always a lot of folks who were ready to check the box score and extract the PPG and RPG and start making beast posts."
Christian Wood
"Bucks got rid of Tobias and Christian Wood for nothing, sooo yea"
imagine if Christian Wood calls a casual center.
"Yesterday Shaq complimented Christian Wood's 27 and 15 game as ""Shaq-like"".  Shaq's praise there was complimenting himself first lol. All the better that Wood called him a casual for being weeks late to recognizing his game"
"Bucks aren't really a draft and development team. Giannis is the only starter at the moment (with Divincenzo out) that they drafted. The second best player they drafted (Brogdon) is now on the Pacers. Other excellent players they found were given up on too early (Norman Powell and Christian Wood). However they definitely developed the hell out of Middleton after acquiring him to become what he is, they rehabilitated George Hill and Lopez, and they have developed guys like Connaughton, Portis, etc to be excellent bench players.   A lot of it has to do with Giannis-- he's so good that all these shooters around him get a chance to build their game without as much defense pestering their shots. It's done wonders for a lot of guys. You see Portis have a great shooting season and it makes you think that a lot of players could show up on the Bucks next year and have career years in order to get paid elsewhere."
They chose to sign Jeremi Grant over Christian Wood which you can’t argue was a bad move. Get your facts straight.
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"Get a serviceable big man like Myles Turner or Christian Wood. Use Wiseman &amp; picks as trade bait. If that roster stays healthy, you have a proper team, especially given the defensive strides 2WayWiggins has made."
Mobley and Christian Wood about to fucking show the NBA that new frontcourt vibe.
Christian Wood and Jerami Grant are great targets for them. Wiseman and their two picks this year are good enough assets to get it done
"Seems a little odd to exclude the best players on each team (i.e. Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Pascal Siakam) if you're asking to rank the teams"
Someone in another thread mentioned Christian Wood and I like the idea - issue is making salaries match though.
"As you mentioned, he's a 4.  When the Rockets inevitably go with Mobley it's going to suck because he may be placed at the 5 and doesn't have enough meat on his frame right now to bang with NBA centers.  Somewhat ironically, a top comparison for Evan Mobley is Christian Wood lol."
"He’s only 25 years old. 7 and 14 aren’t that good. Plus, you’d still have to trade someone on top of the picks to make the salaries work. Rockets aren’t doing that. Can you name the two players you’d draft that would make this work? Because the first tier of the draft is 5 players.   Not to mention, Christian Wood is a top 5 player in a 2015 redraft."
7 and 14 for christian wood. who says no?
"All 3 of the Pistons, Rockets, and Cavs could draft Mobley and have him be a great fit for their roster. Mobley isn’t a paint scorer. He was like 10th percentile in post scoring last year. He’s a face-up, agile, rangy big man. He basically co-exists really well with all of Isiah Stewart, Christian Wood, and Jarrett Allen.  I think in the NBA it makes sense for him to start at the 4 and then play the 5 in spurts. Hell his comps have been AD, JJJ and neither of them play the 5 full time.   I think there’s a very slim chance he’s there at 4 for the Raptors. Imo he’s easily the 2nd best player in the draft and he’s also a good fit for the top 3.  Regardless though the top 4 is where you want to be in this draft. Suggs or Green is an amazing consolation prize for the Raps."
Why get rid of Christian Wood ?
Christian wood to piston
"The basketball gods demand that the Rockets have a good center. Elvin Hayes, Moses Malone, Ralph Sampson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, Clint Capella, and Christian Wood. There's a 100% chance they take Mobley. The universe commands it."
"But honestly, the skilled and bruising bigs rn are like, Jokic, Embiid, and from there on it's a step down into JV and uh, maybe Ayton. In the grand scheme of things I don't really think this is a problem, especially regarding that Christian Wood is really fucking fast for a 4."
"Well stop crying, take your massive freaking W for the vuc trade! Remember the bulls gave you a guy to win now when you made that trade , and it ended up being in the top 10. that trade ended up being as good as possible for y’all.   Not to mention, 8 and 5 give you the best potential trade package to move up if one of those picks were to become available (I.e. if say the rockets  didn’t want to draft Mobley because they like Christian wood.)"

Rockets have Christian Wood and Cavs have Jarret Allen.   I wonder if Masai would try to trade up or something.
Do you guys think that theRockets will take Evan Mobley? I don’t really watch their games and I don’t know if Christian Wood can play PF
It’s not hate just being realistic. They got 9th this year. They aren’t a Christian Wood away from a ring.
Trade for Christian Wood. Rockets get Mobley
Christian Wood is not built to be a center. He gets abused in the post pretty regularly.
Man I'd be looking to take Jalen Green if I was Houston.. gonna be an exciting scorer . Plus they already have Christian Wood an All-Star potential big and he's only 25
How does a Mobley/Christian Wood frontcourt look
I don't know you probably know more than me. I don't even know who is on the rockets beside Christian Wood and Armoni Brooks.
Curious to why not ? I know you guys have Christian wood
Killian Hayes and Christian Wood maybe available?
I really hope it goes that way instead of the spurs turning into a punching bag for the next few years!  Unrelated but man I wish the spurs went after Christian Wood
"We don't need Christian Wood, he was hurt almost this entire last season also, not losing sleep over it."
Didn’t the pistons let Christian wood walk for no reason
How did he bail on being the no 1 option on a contender? Christian Wood and John Wall is not a contending team he was right to leave.
"I still wanted Simmons. If you look at the talk surrounding Simmons now it’s about him going to play with KAT or a center who can spread the floor so Simmons can play the power forward position.   I felt Simmons alongside Christian Wood who is practically a stretch 5 with his beautiful soft shot and an amazing driver who can eurostep to the rim. The issue is Wood is not really a good defender and I think pairing him with a defender like Simmons works very well.   I still think it can happen. If we happen to get Cade then why not trade Wall for Simmons(not sure how all that would workout or if it even would)?  A starting lineup of Wood, Simmons, Tate, Cade(if), and KPJ is a nice young core to develop."
Raptors - Siakam  Rockets - Christian Wood  Nets - Harden  Grizzlies - Morant  Timberwolves - Ant?  Probably not going 82-0
Christian Wood. 20 and 10  37% from 3  3 years 41 mil
Sabonis was born here wasn't he? Maybe Jaren Jackson or Christian Wood could use the reps.
[Nope](https://www.nba.com/rockets/news/rockets-acquire-christian-wood)
Capela got them Christian Wood
"Jamal Murray   MPJ  Bogdan   OG  Simmons  Bench- Seth Curry, Smart, and Christian Wood"

Thought about Murray and Christian Wood myself  PG Tyrese Haliburton   SG Jrue Holiday   SF Khris Middleton   PF Ben Simmons   C  Myles Turner   The smart play is probably to put Murray at one of the guard spots but I like the kid and think he would flourish with these players. I envision Simmons running the offense and defense ala Draymond while having better coverage on D from Turner and the Junkyard Dog, Jrue Holiday."
PG Jamal Murray  SG Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF OG Anunoby  PF Ben Simmons  C Christian Wood
"Philly needs a player to help them contend though. The teams in full rebuild mode have very few of those guys.   Thunder have SGA, who is probably straight up better than Simmons at this point, so I can't imagine they trade him. Other than that, it's basically Kemba and his degenerative knees, a million draft picks, and a G league squad.   Rockets have washed John Wall on one of the league's worst contracts, Eric Gordon, and Christian Wood. No deal there.   Magic could do like, Gary Harris, Terrance Ross, and picks? I don't think Philly is taking Fultz back, and it doesn't make sense to move Isaac. No deal there.  Detroit could offer Grant, Cory Joseph, and picks.  Don't think they would offer a top 5 pick. Don't see a deal there, either."
If we land Cade Cunningham tomorrow then why not trade Simmons for John Wall? It’s clear that Sixers need an actual point guard.   Christian Wood as your stretch center. Ben Simmons as your point forward. JaSean Tate as small forward. Cade Cunningham and Kevin Porter Jr as your guards. Young team. Simmons gets a clean slate and can get help from John Lucas. Stephen Silas can start with a younger core and hopefully develop the team into a real contender.
"This is why I didn’t mind if he came to the Rockets. I felt he could play alongside Christian Wood because CW is basically a stretch 5 and a damn good one. I still feel like he can play the 5, but with a stretch 4 instead.   Sort of like the Hawks. They have Galanari out there as a stretch 4."
"Yeah, if he wasn't going to Tokyo, he'd be organising some games with other NBA players like he did last season when he played a bunch with John Wall, Christian Wood, and other players (which no one seems to mention when they say he didn't try to stay fit at all during last off-season). With this, he get team USA staff to work with and many of the very best to play with during practices."
"Sure but a Gobert, Simmons pairing would be worse than what is happening with Embiid.   Simmons needs to be in a Giannis situation where he is lone non-shooter and there is a rim-protecting big who also spaces the floor like Lopez. It makes Houston not trading for him even funnier from that perspective because Christian Wood would have been a great pairing for him."
Christian Wood with KD handles and Giannis athleticism
"Magic Johnson has clearly not watched enough James Harden if he thinks this was the best season of basketball that James has ever played.   I think Christian Wood said it best, “you’re just a casual”."
Christian Wood and Jarett Allen would never work.
"Probably but those guys are proven commodities and I don’t know if they decrease that significantly. But yes I see your point. I just think a Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen front court along with Levert and some young pieces around that sounds pretty nice."
"Christian wood, Grant, maybe Randal if he proves the regular season isn’t a fluke"
Christian Wood
Ironically Simmons would have fit well on the rockets outside of John wall. Him and Christian wood are a great match. I think the Timberwolves with Kat is a gold pairing and the wolves need a leader defensively.
"I’m done, you win homey! You’re arguing just to argue, none of what I wrote is wrong or is even debatable. But you have such a hardon for harden, your out here showing your ass.  Enjoy the offseason, clown! Christian wood should be great for y’all next year!"
Yeah he definitely asked for John Wall and Christian wood. He also asked the owner not to pay luxury tax during their championship window.
Do you like Christian Wood when he wins MVP soon?
"Christian Wood and Cade Cunningham by year 3 will be in the WCF, book it"
Christian Wood and Cade Cunningham is 3 years will be in the WCF I pray
The Rockets got pocket change for harden 😢. Christian Wood is going to be so famous soon though.
"I totally agree with that statement but he is definitely better than Christian Wood lol. I think paying Gobert 40m+ is too much I would be happy with 20-25M. Thanks for a civil discussion haha, I sometimes get heated."
Lakers need a 3rd star. You can't win a championship with a 37 year old LeBron/AD/role players.  Christian Wood has star potential. He should be their #1 target this offseason.
Christian Wood
"The Cavs are great for player prop parlays. The online site I use has a section for them but call them ""accumulators"". You can add up to 10, one gets you a few bucks, 3 gets you maybe $5-10, 5 starts getting a bit more and 10 you can win like $800- 1600 on a dollar. Garland was one of my favorite players to add for pts and threes. The star players it gets kind of difficult, like Beal the lowest you might be able to take for a certain game is 24. And even 24 doesn't give you great odds, if you want those really tasty odds you gotta take like 28-32. Which is fucking hard! Lots of games at 24-26. So star players I'd do assists and rebs, those are more easily attainable. Threes as well. Then look for mid tier guys to take their points, someone like Garland at over 18 or 20 seems much better. RJ Barrett in the same range, those kind of guys. Garland and Sexton are so good for those, because they're not an unreasonable level. Jarrett Allen rebounds too. I liked Cleveland for those, someone's gotta score on the team, it's not like GS where Steph may score 46 which made everyone else score significantly less. Until Kevin fucking Love came back and threw a wrench into my low key favorite prop team. Those 3 were so reliable until his return. Moses Brown and Christian Wood too.  As a Cavs fan.. since you're obviously not winning a championship next season if you're looking for something to keep the games interesting, you have a really fun team to take for those kind of bets. And again, it's only a dollar, so you don't have to worry about spending crazy money (although obviously you can always bet more). If I had to guess, I'd say the start of next season might be a great time to take them, before those 3 all have solid numbers for a month and people realize. Kevin love should go away though, leave my guys alone so they can get their stats. Really disappointed with the Moses Brown trade too. I liked him on OKC where everybody could forget that he existed. Christian Wood better not go anywhere"
Give me Christian Wood   Maxey/Curry/Tobias/Wood/Embiid is hell to guard.
Or Christian Wood.👀
Christian Wood has my vote
"Christian Wood for Ben Simmons, who says no?"
"The Rockets and it's not even close.  1. Wall's contract is the worst in the league. 2. The Harden trade was a debacle. They walked away with zero young good players and picks from the team of one of the richest owners in the NBA. 3. Christian Wood and Kevin Porter, Jr. are their potential All Star players and both have weird drama in their background. 4. The rest of the roster is players that never panned and older players with little trade value. 5. Their owner is the #1 most likely owner to be forced to sell. He is spiteful, illogical, and will probably run their franchise like a baseball team that makes money and basically farms players for contenders. His financial issues and attitude will trickle down into their organization as he continuously hires the cheapest front office and coaching talent. They are the next perennial bottom feeder of the West. 6. If they do turn it around and start getting better, OKC will have a lot their first round draft capital.  Edit: spelling"
Christian Wood
"there was a scenario where Wall was decent and Christian Wood gave them all star level play... it didn't happen, but for a couple games they looked ok."
"I think if the Warriors are able to flip Wiseman, #5, and future picks into either a star or good supporting players, the Warriors would be locked and loaded and in the mix, especially with Klay. Maybe not title favorites, but still threats in the vicinity of the Suns/Clippers/Bucks.   - Wiseman for Christian Wood - Wiggins+#5 for Hayward  Suddenly you have a Curry+Dray core, with Klay+Hayward+Wood as supporting pieces, and you probably keep JTA+Poole+Bazemore+Looney as well. That can go to war with anyone."
Christian wood wasn't coming back to Detroit
"I am in the camp that doesn’t pay attention to the team, but if others are saying they had a good draft, I’ll take your word for it.   I’m mostly speaking, though, from around the time of the draft. I don’t recall anyone giving them high marks. Could be because this draft had so much mystery because of the pandemic, but feels like the only things I heard about Detroit’s off-season was how they goofed on buying up all the centers basically but not keeping Christian Wood.   I’m hoping for Detroit to return to prominence. They were big during my childhood so I always root for those teams to be good once more! Good Luck! 🙌🏽"
"You're probably right. Personally, I'd love to see them flip their contracts and picks to a team ready to rebuild and get some players that complement him. He's so good, he's sped up their timeline.  I doubt they could land Beal, but Bledsoe/Adams/Picks for Brogdon/Turner or Brogdon/Sabonis could be great. I'm sure DET would send Jerami Grant for the right price. Toronto might part with VanVleet or Siakam if Lowry bolts. They might be able to get Harrison Barnes, Sexton, Kemba, or Christian Wood. Lots of options, IMHO, just need to be willing to part with picks."
Crazy how many teams had and then decided they didn't want Christian Wood.
They cut Christian Wood in order to give Paul a bench/coaching spot for the playoffs
"Feels like this year's draft prospects are trying to one-up each other as basketball hipsters. For too long we have had youngsters saying they look up to MJ, Kobe, even Lebron... so this year we got a Khris Middleton shoutout, and now some Christian Wood respect"
Christian wood would fit so well with this warriors team
Christian wood would be amazing fit imo
Christian Wood showed much more than this in Detroit when he put up like 20/10 after Drummond got traded
Hartenstein will be next seasons Christian wood
"Fun fact, Myles Turner had a better True Shooting percentage than Christian Wood this year. So get out of here with that efficiency argument. Additionally, they are not comparable at all on defense and Turner is the type of player that would fit on the Warriors much better."
I’m really curious if the Warriors would be interested in Christian Wood. Wiseman would be the obvious target and Wood can definitely help them way more in the short term than Wiseman.
"Siakam would be a crazy good addition, put Christian Wood on the radar and see if you can get him as well"
"3 ways or the highway.   CJ is not a completely negative asset, he's quality guard playing out of position because of Dame. He would complement a lot of stars around the league. The problem is we don't want their picks and role players.       However a team like the Rockets, Pistons and Toronto [less likely but possible] would love those picks, so we could move CJ to a team like the lakers, we take on a KCP, the picks go to houston along with picks from us and a combination of Simons / THT / Nas Little and we get Christian Wood."
Give Christian Wood some respect
"- Hell or high water, the Thunder move up and take Mobley, whether it's the Cavs or the Raptors. I just think he fits too well on that roster, and I can't think of any other reason they traded Moses Brown after his semi breakout at the end of the season.  - Warriors swing a trade for either Christian Wood or Siakam using the 7th pick, 14th pick, Wiseman, and matching salaries.  - I feel like the Lakers and Pacers in particular trade their first selections for some veteran role players."
"Yep, casuals like MJ, Shaq, Barkley, and Tatum.  Shaq literally doesn’t know who Christian Wood is."
"Green,KPJ, Christian Wood, and JaeSean Tate would be fun to watch. Hope they find a way to move John Wall. Not optimistic about that"
"I agree with Kings.  Thought they’d be good the past couple years, wth they doin over there lol.  I’d add Twolves, straight up losers man.  Can’t develop anything over there, save the KAT man.  Detroit is probably my third.  That franchise is tumbleweeds like the city.  People running red lights over there.  Pelicans got some squad issues but they do have a ton of assets.  They could be one clever move from being a contender (Move Ingram for a standout defensive wing or floor general?).  The Rocks are rebuilding so I’m presuming their roster is full expiring contracts and trade-able assets though I don’t wish to dive into the numbers lol.  Christian Wood is a great piece for a rebuild as well assuming he comes back healthy."
Christian Wood with better d
The Giannis covid game is putting the Christian Wood covid game to shame!
"But did the rockets develop Christian Wood and KPJ or where they already good when they got there?   KPJ literally just got there so I don't think you can start claiming that their developmentals been improving his game, and I feel similarly about Christian Wood."
Christian Wood for Kuminga/Wiseman

"We’re talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
Christian Wood is the exact opposite   Around 40% from 3 but like 60% from the FT line
"Lol I’m not a GM bro, just a nephew. I’d say Myles turner, javale McGee, Christian wood would all be good fits next to him. Athletic rim runners that don’t need the ball or with the threat of an outside shot. If Zion get doubled every time he’s in the paint it’s gonna be very hard going for him"
Christian Wood
We have Christian Wood and we’re tanking.  Our 20 game losing streak last year was clutch
"Christian Wood didn’t wanna be there. He didn’t want to play for a spot in summer league so they let him walk. As for Julius Randle, why would we pay him when we just got Zion?"
Christian Wood is right here brodie  Give us Kuminga and Wiseman.  Y’all aren’t losing a game when Klay comes back
He traded away Christian Wood for a 2nd rounder that off season and let Julius Randle walk as a free agent.  What a series of events.
I made a Russell Westbrook stat post and a Christian Wood stat post  Guess which of the two got more traction and made the front page  The front page is littered with Lakers discourse cause it’s the most polarizing team and the posts about them garner attention. Not because people only talk about them
Christian Wood can’t shoot and can’t defend the PnR for shit bruv
"I’ve been a Christian Wood fan for the beginning and have gone on the record that letting him go was the biggest mistake the Bucks have made since Horst became GM. Wood is nowhere near worth that much. He’s untested in the playoffs, he’s not a shot blocker and he needs the offense catered in some way toward him. He’s been a empty calorie scorer every time he’s got meaningful minutes. He’s a rich man’s Montrezl Harrell. Good player but his not a building block for a young team."
Christian Wood is 26 years old. He is absolutely not the future of the league.
Christian Wood - 20/10 center that can shoot and Draymond can help hide his meh defense

"The team is still going to do the things that will give them the greatest opportunity to succeed.   The players aren't there to tank and, for the most part, neither are the coaches.   Christian Wood is the team's best player so he's going to be utilized as such.  The comparison is not at all ridiculous because the relative experience level of players is meaningless within the context of an actual basketball game."
"He's third on the team in touches per game. If anything, he's probably getting too many touches considering how inefficient he is compared to Christian Wood."
I watched AD standing infront of the rim and Christian Wood threw the ball in over him. AD didnt even jump to contest.
christian wood gives me muslim wood
Can the blazers borrow Christian wood for a few years
Christian Wood is better than Embiid
"Not hyped about this AD has been guarded by a rookie, Christian wood, and a series of 6’6 players all night. He should have BEEN frying them."
Christian Wood seems to bite on every pump fake
Evangelical pornstar Christian Wood
Porzingis for Eric Gordon/Christian Wood works. Add in a pick from Dallas and I think that is a feasible trade.
We need to trade for Christian Wood or any other skilled big. He would make us so much better. We will never be contenders with fucking Dwight on our team.
"Your team's problem is you will have to pay kevin porter and Jalen green one day. Both of them do the same thing. Jaylen brown is a capable defender though. You would still have cap space to sign a max contract for 2 more years. Now you got a core of Jalen green, Brown and Christian wood plus a  max level player.   The Celtics now got cap space again to do Celtic rental like signings they love to do since John wall contract finishes."
"Last night was match up based. Against christian wood and theis, AD can play the 5 the whole game. But if they were up again Embiid, Jokic or Looney, they’d probably start DJ to eat some center minutes."
You mean the Christian Wood that rolls out the red carpet to opponents on a regular basis?  AD is going to pile drive the Warriors out of the playoffs if Wood is their center.
Right?! It was Christian Wood. He got hit THEN did a full 2 foot gather and then went up with the shot and made it and they counted that. It was way more delayed than this play.
"I bet you they won’t be a bottom 5 team. They look a little discombobulated because they are putting the pieces together but they will start figuring it out. I even called the Bulls were getting big time slept on. People were saying they were a fringe playoff team. I can point you to a post saying they are a top 16 team in the nba and I said they were way higher than 16. I got shifted on… but I’m calling the same with the Rockets. They aren’t quite a playoff team but they are basically a mini Timberwolves team rn. Just like last season how people thought the Timberwolves would be complete ass… if they had not gotten any injuries last season they would have been a fringe playoff team. Now this season they are balling out. I’m just sayin…. These rockets have some really good fire power in KPJ, Jalen Green and Christian wood. They aren’t exactly like the Timberwolves this season, but they are almost what the Timberwolves were last season."

He means Christian Wood isnt good enough for people to be talking about him in 15-20 years like a legend which is true
Yes they were bruh Christian wood and John Wall only played 81 combined games and the rest of the roster was dogshit except Kelly Olynyk who played like Larry bird for like 20 games
Christian wood became goated seemingly overnight.
They actually gave continuation on a Christian Wood layup to end the game where he picked the ball up without dribbling just like here.
"And then they gave one to Christian Wood where he literally stopped, hop stepped, then shot lol"
I will gladly take 1 Christian Wood please.
Gotta question how long Christian Wood is willing to ride it out with these Rockets. He's entering his prime and this team is nowhere near competitive in any sense. He doesn't fit the rebuilding timeline at all.
This Rockets team is so different from what I saw against Boston. It's like they have no gameplan whatsoever.  Btw Christian Wood throws heaviest bricks in the league.
Can 60 year old Christian Wood stop chucking threes?! I’m tryna see Jalen Green smh
"Christian Wood is one of my favorite players in the league, but he gotta be the worst passer in the league, he gets so many turnovers and always throws passes too high, or too hard"
I already know how this is going to play out. Christian Wood is about to have a career night because our small ball lineup is shit defensively w/ Melo and Dwight is out so we see more of it. Cue half this sub saying Christian Wood &gt;&gt;&gt; AD.  We've let Poeltl and the Cavs trees shit on that lineup.
"I was just alluding to OP saying how much his stats are inflated by being on a terrible team. Tbh, a lot of teams can be terrible due to the lack of talent but there are two things that may affect SGA's performance this season: we're the youngest team overall and we barely resemble a real professional team without a legit functional big  Just look at the Rockets, we're still rebuild competitors but they have better roster construction due to Christian Wood. They're still balanced too with KPJ and have better vets like Gordon, House, and Theis. Once Jalen balls out, they might even rack up some wins. We have talent in SGA, Dort, and Giddey too but our roster construction is shittier which means less options for Shai and the guards to create and make plays (unlike last season when SGA mostly played with Hill and Horford)"
Coby White and Patrick Williams for Christian Wood
"Yeah, he's *fine.* But is he somebody you want to pay 13 million dollars a year?   Is he 4 million dollars a year better than Caruso? No.   Is he 3 million dollars a year better than Danny Green? No.   Is he as valuable as KCP or Christian Wood? No.   He's overpaid for what he is, and his value to a contending team isn't worth that much on the open market.   He's a pretty significant negative on offense, and his defense, while not bad, is nowhere near great.   He fits the role of ""Doesn't really suck complete ass at anything, so he doesn't totally kill you""   Which...meh. That's how I see him on the court. A profound ""MEH!"""

"Trade idea:   Mavericks get:   * Christian Wood  Thunder get:   * John Wall  * 2027 Mavericks 1st (top 5 protected)  * 2023 Rockets 1st (lotto protected each year until unprotected 2027)  * 2022, 2024 Mavericks 2nds   Rockets get:   * Kristaps Porzingis  * Darius Bazley  * Gabriel Deck  * Derrick Favors  It works in the trade machine financially. Mavericks burn a pick to turn KP into Christian Wood. Rockets move Wood and a heavily protected pick to get rid of John Wall, and they get back a fair return. Thunder take on Wall's contract to get a few picks. Who says no?"
"This. Just because Christian Wood is good now doesn't mean he always was. I mean hell, the guy didn't even get drafted. You can say maybe the whole world was blind or maybe you can say it was these shortcomings that made him who is he today. Considering it's been 5-6 years since then I'd say the latter is more likely."
"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
"Bey and Stewart seem like solid pieces with higher floors than killian. For his ceiling I am really high on killian as he has shown great passing ability finding open guys.   Stewart plays with so much energy reminds me of that one Charles Barkley vs Dennis Rodman rebounding clip.   I’m still high on Sekou but seems like he has a long way to go, especially because he’s not seeing too much Tim on the floor behind grant and Blake.   Also Josh Jackson is our new Christian wood."
&gt; Christian Wood's ~~inability~~ *unwillingness* to play defense has been ~~greatly~~ *mildly* exaggerated.  Ability was rarely the issue with Wood.
"someone in a Christian wood thread earlier told me the fans would vote him into the all star game, which would mean he starts over one of Lebron, AD, or Kawhi lol"
Let's do Christian Wood and AD! I'm sure nobody has pointed that one out yet /s
"Absolutely not. He’s not even Top 5 tbh.  First up, using per-36 in an argument for a guy who isn’t averaging anywhere close to it is kinda silly. Jalen Leque is the per-36 lol king in the NBA right now, averaging 29 pts 29 reb and 10 asts on 50% FG. How many of you even know which team he’s from? Means nothing.  Now coming to who is actually likely to win it - here are my top 5: 1. Christian Wood 2. Michael Porter Jr. - Grand Canyon sized gap - 3. Jeremi Grant 4. Keldon Johnson 5. Mikal Bridges/Mike Conley  Honestly, it’s really just between Christian Wood and Michael Porter Jr. right now."
I’d rather have Christian Wood than Jerami Grant
"The ringer did a Christian wood article recently that perfectly expressed who Christian Wood is, albeit in the subtext. The ringer is not going to write a hit piece or stray into the negative but the writer (I think) included only quotes that didn't reflect well on Christian.  The most damming was this: After a game against the Magic last season, Orlando head coach Steve Clifford, who coached Wood in Charlotte, approached him. “He’s like, ‘Man, you’ve gotten so much better than where you were before,’” Wood recalled. “I was like, ‘Yeah, I told you so,’ and walked off on him.”  Like, what an egotistical, vindictive, arrogant response. To be offered praise from a former coach and then brag about how you 'walked off on him'. That takes a special kind of delusional lack of self awareness to hand that story to the press as some kind of personal highlight. Telling Giannis that he was better than him is up there too.  The article mentions lack of effort, discipline and being chronicly late early in his career. But, things like that don't cause 6 teams to pass on a unicorn. It has to be deeper and more malignant for an organization and the locker room for that many teams to pass on him. Hell, he played great in New Orleans after Davis demanded a trade and Christian STILL barely beat Joe Johnson for the Pistons last roster spot."
"Christian Wood : Let me tell you something, I haven't even begun to peak. And when I do peak, you'll know. Because I'm gonna peak so hard that everybody in NBA's gonna feel it."

Any fantasy guys out there know Josh Lloyd? He has loads of nicknames for guys. Like Christian Wood is the crucifix.   [Examples](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/cntw21/how_well_do_you_know_the_locked_on_fantasy/)
Man.  I love Christian wood but he’s quickly starting to get overrated.  That being said Houston might be a better team this year than last
I'm from the future and everyone is already reverse meming about how AD is the Great Value Christian Wood
"I don't get it. Are the media trying to talk a Harden trade into existence at this point to farm controversy?  After striking oil on Wall's healthy return, they've struck gold on Christian Wood for pennies on the dollar. DeMarcus is healthy as well.  Harden isn't getting traded. Nobody is offering shit and nobody is at the end of the phone in Houston either."
And Christian Wood
"Yeah I remember that too, it was when they were playing the Rockets on New Years Eve (Kings-Rockets have already played twice) and Bagley called for an iso against Wood and then failed miserably.  The post was a highlight that was literally 1 v  1 Bagley vs Wood, so naturally the comments would be about that.  Like it's just comparing them because they are matching up directly and are supposed to play similar roles on their team, and Wood was undrafted whereas Bagley went #2.  It's not that crazy.  They are a few years apart but there was never a situation where undrafted Christian Wood was supposed to be better than Bagley by year 3."
Yeah that’s also true but the main point is these people have been getting better consistently throughout their careers. Christian wood another recent example.
Bro how the hell did you let Christian Wood just walk?😂
Nah Christian Wood is gonna win that unanimously.  But Sexton has been pretty darn good and has picked up right where he left off last year.
"Idk. I think Christian Wood ""The Crucifix"" is the best nickname in the history of the NBA."
Did you comment this on the five Christian Wood stat lines that have been posted since the season started?   /r/nba has been calling him a bust since the Knicks drafted him
Tilman burned the franchise to the ground.   But at least the Christian Wood contract was solid!
Nope  We traded pick and Robert Covington for  Christian Wood  DET pick  POR pick
"Right? Strange I had to come this far down the thread for someone to point it out. Bigs generally take a little too get to get back into game shape anyway. Plus, if he’s still the passer and shooter he was before, we don’t need him to rim-run like Christian Wood. That’s what we have Christian Wood for. Lol."
"That's true. I expect a bit of a dip (-4 ppg at most, so still 20+ ppg), mainly because of the emergence of Christian Wood as a scoring option, while also having a shift to more assists too.   I think it could be as you described too, with Wall feasting as teams worry about Harden."
Makes me smile seeing Process era Sixers finding their way around the league.   Christian Wood  Richaun Holmes  Jerami Grant   Others like Tj McConnell and Ish Smith  Put some respect on Sam Hinkie's name.
"Teams would do well to not underestimate the value of real plus minus and other one value metrics when describing a player's performance in certain roles.  Analytics circles had been screaming about Christian Wood since last season and somehow everyone missed.   Montrez Harrell I think is a historic underpay.  His true shooting percentage, while above average, is even higher when you factor in his insane rebounding rate off his own misses.  His ws/48 have hovered around .200 (3rd team all nba level) since his sophmore year and his defensive liabilities are overstated."
I am gonna correct for you:  Christian Wood is the best ~~non max/ non rookie contract in the NBA @ 14 mil~~  Better.
"I am now a Christian Wood stan, man is a monster and his comeback is crazy"
"Rockets Big 3 of John Wall, Christian Wood, and Eric Gordon showing up big today"
"I came here to say that Christian Wood is a beast, I could easily see him finishing as a top 10 big this season"
"Good news Barnes, now we're .500 you can shave.   Side note, can we PLEASE trade Marvin DoubleJump Stonehands for Christian Wood?  Bagley in his third year and looks as lost as ever.  Zero improvement from his first game in the league."
christian wood for MIP and all star
Is Christian Wood the rich man’s Bagley?
Eric Gordon legitimately hates Christian Wood lmao. Man does not wanna pass to him at all
Christian wood is who hassan whiteside thinks he is
"Harden should give this team a chance, they can compete. Christian Wood was a good pickup."
"&gt; If players like Siakam, Christian Wood and others can develop into stars, why not Wiggins?  Because they've actually shown those improvements in substantial ways over the past few season. Look at Siakam's season by season stats. Same with Wood.  This paragraph about Wiggins is literally said about him every season. Vague things about his better defense, better passing lmao  Where is this better passing? His assists are down, his efficiency is down and his offensive scoring is what people expect most from him.   He is in his 6th season and he is still made at best marginal improvements. If he isn't an all star now, he will never be a star player.   And before you mention him being on a team with curry with his lack of assists so far, his USG is in the same range as it was in Minnesota."
"Rockets still rely on switching defense, he is incredibly slow and gets fatigued easily. Also, the rockets aren't going to play him and Christian Wood simultaneously and C Wood has been amazing."
"Never mentioned cheerleaders or fans tonight, broadcast quality is objectively shit, pizza commercial was obviously a joke, Christian Wood praise is OTT. Anything else?"
"Christian Wood is probably one of the most obvious Most Improved Players of all time. His odds are already down to +240, which is crazy this early in the season. Detroit is truly a stupid franchise."
"You complain a lot.  Fans, cheerleaders, broadcast quality, pizza commercials, Christian Wood praise."
Is this NBATV or the Houston local network? Bc all im hearing from the halftime report of tied game is CHRISTIAN WOOD GOOD KINGS BAD AMIRITE HAHAHAHA
John Wall and Christian Wood are the leaders for the Rockets. Harden back to OKC
Christian Wood really is my dad
Christian Wood is so damn good
Christian Wood a MIP contender? I don’t watch much Rockets basketball.
Christian Wood is who Marvin Bagley thinks he is.
Christian wood
"Hahaha NBA TV is so clueless they don't even know its ""Christian Wood"" and not ""Christian Woods"". Bunch of amateurs."
"I've mostly just watched him in the two Lakers games, but man he looks comfortable shooting the three. Same motion, good shot selection and timing. The Spurs minus LMA are actually really fun to watch right now. Dejounte/D white/LWalker/Demar/Keldon are a fun group. If they had a more modern big like Christian Wood or Boucher, they'd be a blast."
Kemba  Nurkic   MPJ  Jrue  Christian Wood/John Wall
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
"Unlike people who hopped off the bandwagon, I actually watch the Warriors. Here are some tangible ways he improved:  Better defense: he uses his athleticism to leverage blocks, is better on the perimeter and contests most shots he is supposed to. People will point to the Middleton game, but those points were scored almost exclusively on Paschall.  Better Passing: In the Detroit game and others he has used his driving game to create opportunities for his teammates, they just bricked. While the tunnel vision isn't completely gone, he makes an effort to pass more if he doesn't need to shoot.  Better off ball movement: plenty of times Wiggins has been maligned for playing awfully off ball. Yesterday he was cutting and camping the corner wide open, while Golden State didn't pass to him.  It's crazy that I'm defending a dude who has had a more solid nba career than many others on reddit. Oh and btw he's only 25... If players like Siakam, Christian Wood and others can develop into stars, why not Wiggins?"
"these comments are some bullllllshit for leaving out Bagley.  He's probably not the 3rd best right now over ayton, but to leave him off the list entirely is pretty disrespectful.      For the record:        Player| Games | Pts | Rbs | Ast | FG% ---|---|----|----|----|---- MPJ | 59 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 52% Bagley | 80 | 15 | 8 | 1 | 49% JJJ | 115 | 15 | 5 | 1 | 49% Ayton | 115 | 17 | 11 | 2 | 57%  He hasn't been healthy, but none of these guys really have been.  And of all the players, I don't think anybody can argue Bagley's not stuck playing for the most poorly run organization of the group.  Luke walton sucks.       (also, i'm annoyed my post of Bagley swatting Christian Wood yesterday got removed):  https://streamable.com/rf0ps0)"
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
"He does play meaningful minutes, he scores double figures in a game, he averages 12 and 8.  And he’s 21, he’s gonna get better.  You go by players actual age and not years in the league or where they got drafted.  Comparing a 25 year old Christian Wood to a 21 year old Bagley and saying what he would never become is dumb. Like we said at 21 Wood was a projected lottery pick who went undrafted averaging 3 points begging for a spot in the league."

"Fun fact, AD is only two years older than Christian Wood."
Christian WOOD
Josh Jackson is looking nice too. Many people had written him off but he's playing well with his new opportunity. Maybe he'll have a Christian Wood-esque revival in Detroit too.
"Ability is ability. Some guys are able to do things and others aren't. Christian Wood is able to do a lot of things that most guys can't.  You're also unintentionally comparing Wood to a guy who was the consensus 1st overall pick and was compared to LeBron throughout highschool. Nobody thinks Andrew Wiggins doesn't have talent, he just can't seem to put it all together consistently and improve."
"""Christian Wood is what Bagley thinks he is."""
Is Christian Wood a PF? Tucker is the starting C for the rockets... right?
"(That’s not really accurate, because the only time in his career where he got significant minutes on a regular basis was the second half of this past season, where he was a positive player on both ends of the court and the team was significantly better with him on the court and significantly worse with him off the court) [https://pistonpowered.com/2020/07/30/detroit-pistons-good-christian-wood-2019-20/].  It was a major concern prior to that stretch, because he previously hadn’t been great on defense, but he was also on bad defensive teams(at least when he was getting regular playing time), including when he wasn’t getting much playing time with the Pistons early in the season."
"The sample size you’re looking at for over his while career so far is really small and often on reduced minutes. Not only that, the second half of the season this past season, you know, the first and only time in his career before now where he was getting regular quality minutes, [he was a plus offensive and defensive player](https://pistonpowered.com/2020/07/30/detroit-pistons-good-christian-wood-2019-20/). He was an above average to good defender for a bad team.  I didn’t disregard what the other user said, I disagreed with them. I also didn’t disregard them because they’re a Lakers fan, I disagreed with them, then stated an observation that Lakers fans seem to hate when people compare him to AD.  Not sure why you came into this with the attitude you have, but it helps to not compound a bad attitude with bad info at the same time."
"We really traded this guy, Ingram, a recent 2nd pick, and multiple FRPs for a rich man's Christian Wood. SMH."
Christian Wood lite
Christian Wood is so proud
Nothing more than a Salavation Army Christian Wood
Christian wood no dount
I watched this right after watching Marvin Bagley turn it over against Christian Wood and it made that post even funnier
"Its unknown if Brogdon wanted to stay with the Bucks, and we don't know what other types of offers may have been for him out there. I take Jrue over Brogdon at this point too, and there is no way we could have Giannis Khris Jrue and Malcolm. Christian Wood bounced from a lot of teams, and was known to have attitude problems. Would have been nice to keep him but Bud has a hard on for Ilyasova and we have been trying to make DJ Wilson serviceable. Playing alongside Harden also massively plays to Woods strengths. This is hindsight 20/20 by the  Reddit GMs"
Christian Wood is lucky that Bagley didn’t bust out his signature second jump on him
"Bagley still could. Wood shows that Bagley still has potential. Wood is 25 years old in his 6th season. While Bagley is 21 and in his 3rd year.   When Christian Wood was 21, he averaged 3pts/2reb in 8 minutes appearing in 13 NBA games. Bagley is averaging 12 and 8 this year. So he is way ahead of where Christian Wood was at this point."
Honestly Harden's refball fuckery is still annoying af but everything else (i.e. Christian Wood) is fun
"hes a bit fickle because he knows that rockets team can be good. christian wood is the real deal. silas is a good coach, john wall may be a better fit as a PG and defender despite being the inferior player to westbrook."
"Almost entirely likely it’s Christian wood   The rockets seemed determined to play around him in every game, even preseason so far. So with the touches and position the rockets have put him in, I’m very sure he’s at least gonna average 19/10. With him being barely making a roster, and now being one of the main options on a playoff team, it’s his"
Christian wood
I’d go Mikal Bridges or Christian Wood right now. I thought Jaylen made a great jump last year I don’t think it’s him
"Hard to tell if they can “win” with this team. If John wall returns to form and Boogie can at least be 75% of his prime, along with Christian Wood looking like a 20pts/10rebs kinda guy. Then you have the bench mob including all the younger guys. To me that sounds like a good to great team."
James and Christian on the floor together makes my wood harden
James Harden is unreal and I’m so happy to see Christian Wood thrive. If you dig through Google Photos you can actually see him in a Process-era Sixers jersey! I think it’s cool that Philly was a stop in his redemption arc.

Christian Wood
"I meant that none of these players are ""must-see TV"" would I watch Christian Wood play if I'm free? Sure. Would I drop everything just to watch Christian Wood play? Nah"
Christian Wood went from a waiver wire cut to the focal point of the Pistons in a season
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."
I got relentlessly shit on all offseason for saying Riley should pay Christian Wood and worry about creating space for a potential Giannis/whoever after. Also drafted Wood in fantasy and paid a decent amount for him.
"I know playing with Harden is giving him better shots etc, but Christian wood is basically averaging the same (23.6/10) and he cost 3/5ths as much and they let him go. They only wanted to pay him 2/5s as much, and I don’t think they are that far apart.   And I don’t think that either is a no.1 option, so I don’t think I would pay. Even thought I love Jerami and he was great energy on the nugs. I would love to have him on my team as a 3-7th man, not a no.1. I also get 90s blue balls thinking about his uncle (and dad to a lesser extent). Ho was my first fave player."
Matthew Dellavedova Serge Ibaka Klay Thompson Christian Wood /s
Raptors (1-6) and Rockets (2-4)  Kyle Lowry / John Wall  James harden / FVV   OG / Eric Gordon   Siakam / Tucker   Christian Wood / Boucher
"Why would he do that?  He can play at 50% effort while collecting 39M doing it  He would be beyond moronic to turn down that player option for 40M next season  Ibaka got 10M, Trez 9M, Kuzma 13M, Christian Wood 13M  Blake isnt even playing close to Ibaka or Trez's level right now  He would be lucky to get 40M over 3 years if he was a free agent this season and he will get that entire amount next year  Blake will be traded and he will put up an ultra efficient 15/8/3 assists while helping a team make a deep playoff run"
"Ya they should also go for Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Mitchell Robinson and Christian Wood."
That’s really interesting about the CAD bit. I think it speaks to the fact that when it comes to expansion and running an NBA franchise there are probably just so many factors to consider that makes expansion complicated. I think the potential to give more guys a chance is exciting there. Christian Wood is one of those dudes who dwindled on the fringes for quite a while but thrived under the right circumstances.
John Wall and Christian Wood are averaging 23 ppg each with harden
Honestly though why not just get Christian Wood instead and have some spacing for Zion?
&gt; We have the personnel to be at least a top 10 defense.   Probably not this year realistically.  Christian Wood likely won't become a good interior defender over the course of one season.
"We have the personnel to be at least a top 10 defense. Nwaba is probably the best wing defender we've had since Ariza - strong, and great weak-side help defender. Christian Wood isn't great yet, but his size alone is an upgrade over the pocket rocket lineups that were decent last season. John wall is a huge upgrade over Westbrook defensively.   The last 2 games have been really frustrating. We cut the lead or tie the score in the 4th, but proceed to alligator arm every offensive possession until the buzzer sounds. It's possessions and situations like that where the offense needs to resort to simple iso ball with Harden at the helm, but he was shying away from the moment yesterday + the previous game against Dallas, which was very frustrating to watch."
"&gt;Simmons works best in the current situation he’s in  Don't know if I believe that at all. Swap Embiid/Richardson for Kawhi/Christian Wood and you're much better off, aren't you?  I'd rather have a stretch 5 who doesn't need the ball in his hands, save some cash there, and have a secondary perimeter creator who can shoot."
Yeah we’ve all known that the NBA doesn’t market the game of basketball that well. Shaq didn’t even know who Christian Wood was.
Yeah it’s beyond pathetic to not know that considering what his job is. And it’s also pathetic he barely knew who Christian Wood was
"Post torn Achilles John Wall, Christian wood, and washed boogie cousins as your best players and a new rookie hc? Harden was not out of line at all. He wanted a trade and is 32. He wants to win. He hasn’t yet. Only thing he did wrong was force cp3 out for Westbrook. The rockets weren’t winning anything this year and everyone knew it. Rockets were the ones who said let’s get uncomfortable so harden obliged."
"i'm starting to think that Fertitta is a goddamn genius, genius work with that rebuild... Christian Wood... getting picks, still competitive."
Christian Wood slander will not be tolerated
Christian Wood on 2021-01-14
Rockets make it with Christian Wood winning MIP
"More risky than having Wall and Cousins out there on those crusty ass legs after both of them have essentially missed two full seasons? At least Christian wood looks like a stud. For as much success/innovation that the harden/morey duo brought, they really did leave the rockets franchise in a shitty position for not having won anything. I’d feel bad but their owner is an asshole and dumbass with his other business ventures"
"Totally agree.  Shaq's TV persona is gross. I respect a lot of the stuff he has done off the court but he is ridiculously thin-skinned about his accomplishments, he talks about championship basketball like he has Bill Russell's record and he doesn't respect the game and his position enough to know the players in the way he should.  Christian Wood called him a casual after Shaq admitted he didn't know his game. What?!?  And now this little segment with no one fact-checking his shit, it's embarrassing stuff."
"Good thing we got Christian ""Mini AD"" Wood and Jae'sean ""Mini Draymond"" Tate."
"fwiw, i saw that christian wood was shooting 27% from 3 before last night's game. from a spurs fan's perspective, it seems like someone who usually shoots 30% or lower from 3 decides to make 80% of their 3pt attempts when playing the spurs"
Christian Wood calling Shaq a casual is real shit. If you love this game you dive deep into the backgrounds of these players.
Lmao they had Christian Wood and Keldon Johnson
Yeah I was just thinking that Shaq also said he didn't know Christian wood. It would not surprise me if he really thought jokic was Russian but it's more likely to me that he was just being a dick on purpose lol.
COTY - Nate Bjorkgren  MIP - Christian Wood  6MOTY - Chris Boucher   ROTY - Tyrese Haliburton   DPOY - Joel Embiid   MVP - I have no clue rn  Philly trades for Kyle Lowry and make it to the Finals but lose to the Lakers in 6 games.
"Shap and Chuck are not analysts, they are entertainers, but it is still so disheartening how little they actually watch/care about. For the entire Warriors run Chuck kept saying that jump-shooting teams cant win a champion. For the last 3 years or so Chuck has been saying the Blazers are the best team in the West when they simply have shown nothing of that standard and can't play defense. We saw last night that Shaq had no idea how good Christian Wood has been and any non-casual fan knows Christian Wood would be one of the most important free agents this year. Last year Chuck said the Miami Heat don't scare anyone in the East. I could go on forever but I think it's clear that Inside the NBA is not a collection of NBA experts. They are obviously basketball experts and have more insight than almost anyone but their lack of attention to the NBA and its moving parts is telling."
I mean Shaq didn’t even know who Christian Wood was until last night. Pretty puzzling
Shaq is paid to be ignorant lmao. Guy didn't even know who Christian Wood was
"Christian wood has had “breakout years” three time now, and everyone keeps forgetting about him. Think it’ll stick this time though"
But seriously how can you hate Christian Wood or the way he plays? I remember last season when I first saw Christian Wood and was like who is this dude and been a fan ever since!
I would sacrifice my OWN life for Christian Wood.
"Haha, that is what is great about hooping at a different place, people got different rules and different play styles   My point is that, Serbians aren't gonna stop watching the NBA, because Shaq was disrespectful   Shaq literally told Christian Wood, ""i didn't know who you were"" yesterday.    And also called him ""Woods"""
I am a Mavs fan and this is really fucking with me. I am now a gigantic Christian Wood fan. Damn.
"Beef with Rudy Gobert now ended, Christian Wood is my nemesis now"
Christian Wood definitely watches flight
He apologized to Christian Wood last night for not knowing who he was. Sounded like he was admitting he was wrong. Shaq seems like a really good guy thats making the most of what god gave him. You dont need to like his takes to appreciate Shaq. Hes pure entertainment imo.
"His point is that ""Tiger Wood"" is wrong, just like ""Christian Woods"" is wrong; the 's' matters.   Crazy how people are not getting this and thinking it was a joke lmao"
Shaq gonna ask wood “bout what bout the rings Christian!”
Do you realize how hard it is to increase your ppg by one or two points? Lmfao you really said Christian Wood gonna avg 28/15 I’m done😂
Shaq is a casual lol. Also Christian Wood really just came out of nowhere to be a top-5 center.
People here acting like Christian Wood is some household name. I first learned about him last year near the end of the year on the Pistons. And cuz national writers were talking about him. I don't go out of my way to watch Pistons games. It's a hell of a rise and I love it cuz everyone acts like once you hit 24 NBA players are totally static and can't improve and elevate when time and time again that's been disproven.
