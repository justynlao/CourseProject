"I was looking for our last one and was shocked to find that Ben McLemore won it in November 2013. Then I saw that the other Western Conference winners for that season were Trey Burke (3x), Nick Calathes, and Gorgui Dieng and that kind of explains things.  Prior to that was Tyreke Evans (2x) in 2009. Boogie didn't win any the next year because Blake Griffin swept all the months. And that's it for Sacramento Kings winners."
You should wait until you have been able to take the time to watch each team play a few times before making this big of a list for the season. Having James Johnson above Maxi Kleber and Willie Cauley-Stein above Trey Burke is unfathomable as a Mavs fan.
"&gt;	Im curious about the mavs guard situation. I thought Brunson was supposed to be the guy that gave Luka a break, but it seems like mavs fans are still desperate for that second ball handler. Whats going on with Terry? Does rhe offense just stop when Luka sits?  So brunson being that guy may have been the plan but the reality is that he just can‚Äôt run the offense well, imo. He seems to be a much better scorer than playmaker and trying to give him playmaking duties just isn‚Äôt going well. The reality is that Brunson actually plays much better *with* Luka, which is great, but in terms of getting Luka rest, it obviously isn‚Äôt ideal. The best secondary playmaker is JRich by a long shot and him working with Luka is ideal.  Carlisle usually goes with Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke when Luka is sitting, but both those guys face the same issue of being better scorers than passers. This lineup also runs with KP as the main offensive creator and Jesus Christ is that not doing so hot rn, so then it falls on Tim to hit shots and if they aren‚Äôt falling, offense stagnates. Not to mention with Burke and Brunson, defense takes a big hit. All of this culminates into a meh offense that gets lead disappearing quick until Luka and the starting unit come back and try to fix it.  As for Terry, are you talking about Tyrell Terry, our rookie? I personally wish he‚Äôd get minutes but Rick doesn‚Äôt really play rookies, especially now with a healthy lineup. It‚Äôs a shame because Terry has shown flashes, and his development will go a long way for us in the future."
"Incredibly weird player.  Obviously talented.  I suspect he will need to kick around a bit to get to the next level of consistency, a la trey burke one of those guys.    Hornies should prolly cut bait, right?  Unless he's willing to accept something absurdly team friendly like lu dort money"
Pleasant: Jalen Brunson being back with 50/40/90 shooting splits  Unpleasant: James Johnson and Trey Burke playing 3rd and 4th most minutes because all of our starters got covid.
"This is excellent. He'll re-find his love for the game. His confidence is rotting watching younger players usurp his minutes with less talent. He knows it's about the work now. He's learned professional lessons. He took it too personally when Luka stole his team away as a doughy white guy. Then got boo'd by new york's own fans on home court after the trade. He's gonna be back - look at Trey Burke, Chris Boucher, Norm Powell, Van Vleet, Keldon Johnson, Christian Wood. Jerami Grant. at least 40% of the NBA is situation &amp; time."
A few Trey Burke 3s would be very welcome right now :D
i wouldnt mind if one game this season we just let Trey Burke iso every play
That's exactly it. Dallas could have had postponements instead of Ls if Trey Burke and Boban had made out with Maxi Kleber.
"I know his bad percentages hurt the team, but we have no other options. We are last in 3 point percentage because everyone aside from Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke have regressed from last season. And usually The latter aren't out there when Luka is. It's demoralizing to drive and pass out to people knowing that it is gonna be a guaranteed brick, so I understand why he takes dumb shots sometimes. But still, he needs to be better at 3s if we want to win a playoff series."
"More like Puka Dong Ditch   More like Krispy Poor-Dingus  More like Tim Fart-away Jr  More like Fanny-Sith as in the Disney trilogy Sith bleh  More like Josh Poorer-son  More like Jalen ""Bruh""-son  More like Trey ""Doris"" Burke W  More like Willy Calley Enstine for some bright ideas"
"Ty Corbin, Trey Burke, and Enes Kanter."
God remember when Trey Burke was our best player?
"Yeah, I was gonna say, I know you guys have had some serious Covid issues. It‚Äôs kinda ridiculous to judge Luka on the Mavs record and do the almost always ridiculous good stats-bad team thing, especially when we literally just saw how directly his play lead to winning last year for the Mavs.  Also Luka‚Äôs one of the best offensive initiators in the league, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to take him off-ball so Trey Burke can run the offense."
"And that‚Äôs why he retired. Iverson could‚Äôve given The Grizzlies, Pistons, whoever 20 minutes a game somewhere between Trey Burke and Lou Williams. But he didn‚Äôt want to do that."
Brunson? Cavs not picking up the phone if it‚Äôs not at least Luka and Trey Burke
"When did I say lebrons was better? You were putting the mavericks on a pedestal. I'm merely pointing out they are a mediocre team.   Hardaway Jr was a salary dump by the knicks in the KP trade. Seth curry bounces around to a new team every season, trey burke was picked up off waivers. Klieber is a back up center. These are average level players who are no better than 80% of the rest of the nba teams. Carlise is a good coach sure, but stop acting like this is some dream team supporting cast. Its no better than what zion has in NOLA"
"I believe great players will be great regardless.  Especially if you watch them all through college and you think that‚Äôs the guy, and then he falls to your team, and you take someone else, and then he becomes the guy ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  And Utah had Trey Burke and did him dirty for Exum, who became......."
Brunson was suuuuch a big steal for this team in the 2nd round. He always looks comfortable and as a fan you always feel safe with him either off ball or with the ball in his hand. Him and Trey Burke are great back up PGs.
Additional sadness is that Trey Burke probably isn't in the NBA in this timeline.  But Cuban would probably be getting a lot less hate emails over the RSN sitaution.
"yeah well Trey Burke and Brunson got super hot for no reason lmao, these things can happen, does not really mean anything."
This is gonna sound like a weird comparison but I feel like TJ McConnell is the defensive version of Trey Burke. And Trey Burke is the offensive version of TJ McConnell.
"The stupid thing is that when I see a guy like Trey Burke run about out there with the big dudes he kind of looks like Messi next to Ibrahimovic in football, so in my head I just presume that all NBA players are sort of the same size as football players - when Trey Burke is above avarage height in Sweden and the others are simply giants."
"It's actually insane to me how quickly McGary busted, especially since it wasn't due to injuries. He was hurt a good deal at Michigan, but he looked like an absolute surefire NBA player when he did play, *especially* during that NCAA tourney run they had.   Just goes to show you how different the NBA is from the NCAA. The guys who I thought for sure would end up being good players from those teams (Trey Burke, Nik Stauskas, Mitch McGary) have decidedly struggled to catch on in the NBA (Burke's doing nicely in Dallas now, but he's capped now at decent bench player), and the guys I thought would struggle a bit more (THJ, LeVert) are legit starters."
"Trey Burke. I have no bias, ofcourse."
*Kyle Lowry and Trey Burke star in the seasons most anticipated sequal...*
Thought we should've went for trey burke. Yet to have a memorable game.
Trey Burke and James Johnson had the lowest +/- yesterday and today....the two games we needed them to step up in bigger roles. Says a lot.
Drives me wild to see how good Trey Burke can be and how ass can be be for the majority of the time.
Trey burke
Trey Burke
Trey Burke
"lmao, THJ and Burke alone won Dallas that trade. We traded a scrub in Dennis Smith Jr. and two late first round draft picks for THJ who is a 16-18 PPG player on 40+% from 3, and Trey Burke who has been incredible for us.   Not to mention we got Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is who is a 20/10 guy."
"Trey Burke sitting at, game worst, -23 +/- smh"
Remember when trey burke put up 42/12 lol
"Yeah sorry, I still don't buy it, not that John Hollinger is gospel but here are his comments on Dwight signing with the Sixers:  ""Philadelphia lured Dwight Howard from the Lakers on a one-year minimum deal that only counts $1.6 million against their cap, even though Howard will make $2.6 million. With Howard‚Äôs BORD$ value just over $3 million, this is good business for Philly, giving them a decent option in the middle when Joel Embiid takes a load management night off. The Lakers will need to find another minimum big man to take his place.""  This means that even after having a good showing in the playoffs, his value was just slightly over the minimum, which I would guess means that he was around minimum value when he signed with the Lakers.  The difference between Rondo and Howard is that Rondo's a guard, and guard backups are just much more valuable than backup centers in today's NBA. Also, on Rondo he says:  ""Rajon Rondo‚Äôs two-year, $15 million kinda sorta shores up a position that hurt the Hawks last season, but I thought there were better options out there for Atlanta. The second year on a deal for a 34-year-old is, shall we say, suboptimal. The Hawks had several options at this price point, so lasering in on Rondo at the expense of, say, D.J. Augustin, Shabazz Napier, Elfrid Payton or Trey Burke seemed unusual. Burke, in particular, would have fit right in to the Hawks‚Äô high pick-and-roll, rinse-and-repeat scheme and he got half as much money from Dallas.""  So it's very possible that Rondo just got overpaid."
Napier is better than a lot of guys on rosters right now. Reminds me of Trey Burke the undersized guard that nobody likes and has a hard time finding a team. Trey Burke had to blow up in the bubble to get some sort of stability
"Don't let KP's deep missed distract you from Trey Burke decides to play hero with the missed layup, and then he missed a 3."
trey burke has the iq of a fucking muppet
why is trey burke isoing with 2 minutes left in the game lmfao what a fucking idiot
Still can't believe Brett Brown had Trey Burke in the mud
good to see we're not the only team trey burke destroys
Trey Burke should be in the 6th MOY contention.
I love everytime Trey Burke hits a shot
And Trey Burke SVG
"Starting lineup for our last game was - Doncic - Tim Hardaway Jr - Wes Iwundu - Willie Caulie Stein - Porzingis  we played a 9 man rotation featuring those 5 plus Josh Green, Trey Burke, James Johnson, and Boban  should look similar tonight"
Nah... It's already been said that BB was part of the decisions multiple times.   You're absolutely right... Shake was not this good at the beginning of last season. Although..... We had Trey Burke. We gave him almost no playing time and BB decided he wanted to keep Raul Neto instead.   Burke could've easily fit into the role shake occupies now. It's exactly what we needed... A ball handling guard that could create his own shot.
That Trey Burke game still gives me nightmares
"THJ has looked like a third star some games, Trey Burke had 32 the other night. Maxi was lights out in the Denver game and hit what would have been a game winner on an assist from Doncic.  Our supporting cast is a lot better than you think"
One night Trey Burke is Allen Iverson reborn and the next one he can't hit an open barn door. LMAO
Well Trey Burke leading the second unit is rough and we don't want to run too many plays though KP during his first game back.
Is that a cross between alec burks and trey burke?
Beating Vuc AG Ross and our C team isn't impressive.  What was impressive was AG and his defense on Luka.  What wasn't was Cliff's defensive scheme of not helping off of Wes Iwundu and Green but helping off of Tim Hardaway.  That said Trey Burke always cooka us for some reason.  I just want Fournier and MCW back so we have an actual fighting chance in games.
Trey Burke
trey burke can play basketball again? wtf
"[Trey ""Allen Iverson"" Burke](https://nba-js.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03061801.jpg)"
It's official. Trey Burke must have something personal against everyone who plays in Orlando.
Trey Burke &gt; Trae Young
I love Trey Burke so much man. Gonna be to Luka what Barea was to Dirk
This game seemed like it had zero intensity. Magic couldn‚Äôt buy a 3. Gordon did excellent minimizing Luka. Trey Burke was a god. Mav‚Äôs supporting cast is underrated.
Trey Burke turns into the avatar of Kobe and AI twice a year
Trey mother fucking Burke
"It's cool we have Tim ""Kobe Bryant"" Hardaway and Trey ""Allen Iverson"" Burke out there tonight."
Man Trey Burke always kills the magic
Trey burke and thj maaaaan
"Trey ""The Suggestion"" Burke"
"Ben Gordon - I thought he would be what Beal and Devin Booker are right now. I was actually pretty thrilled that he was signing with the Pistons, after his playoff performances for the Bulls. He wasn't at that level though, and the Pistons were in a bad spot, in terms of roster construction and coaching turnover.  Trey Burke - I thought he was very good at U of M. It took him a while to get going in the NBA though, where he's productive, but not the star that I envisioned.  Kenneth Faried - I didn't see him in college, but I saw some of the things he could do as a young NBA player. Then, he showed out on USA's FIBA team in 2014. I was thoroughly convinced that Faried was a star in the making, at least on the defensive side of the ball.   Then, as I noticed he was losing minutes in Denver's rotation, I started reading up what Denver fans were saying, and it wasn't really matching what I thought about him. He had great physical talent, but that was pretty much it"
This is very random but Trey Burke would be so good on the Warriors team
Nuggets fan here. Nick Yokic has the potential to be a great player and is underrated. Bowl Bowl needs more minutes plain and simple. I think the only team that can beat them are the 1976ers. Joe L Bead has the size and quickness to match up against Yokic and thats before factoring in Trey Burke.
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
Trey Burke and Michael Beasley
Brandon Ingram and trey Burke knicks legend
i miss trey burke wish we hadnt traded him
"Trey ""Bubble Allen Iverson"" Burke comes off the bench for us. He and Brunson have done pretty well on offense for the second unit."
Wait. His dads name isn‚Äôt Alphonso or is Benji a nickname. Cause Trey Burke is Alphonso Burke III
Um trey Burke last year? Man y‚Äôall are stupid
"Idk about that one.  IMO  DFS&gt;Cam Kleber&gt;Hunter Powell&lt;Clint THJ&lt;Bogdan  James Johnson&gt; Hill Trey Burke&lt;Huerter  Gallo,Rondo, and Dunn haven't really played.   I think it's closer than most think."
"Luka KP Jalen Brunson Tim Hardaway JR  Maxi Kleber Dorian Finny Smith Willie Cauley Stein Trey Burke  Tough leaving Boban off the list, but these are definitely the 8 most important Mavs. Not sure anyone from our team would be taken tbh. Richardson, James Johnson, Powell, and Iwundu have been underwhelming and we haven't seen much of anything from our rookies yet"

"I have been saying this. We payed Raul Neto and Trey Burke more money combined than TJ makes. In all seriousness, the 2020 sixers were in dire need of a good locker room guy/leader and TJ could‚Äôve done that. He had more pull over Joel and Ben than Brett Brown."
Trey Burke also in Dallas
"Woah!  Pump on the brakes.   He wasn't anything special with feeding/passing to other players.   To a large extant, he is Trey Burke with more size and better 3pt% and that's about it.   I love Seth but let's not pretend that 95% of the reason he has value is his incredible shooting."
"The problem is that he had to go to China (lack of offers in NBA) to continue hooping when guards like JR, IT, Trey Burke, **Reggie Jackson**, Ish Smith etc etc etc were still getting contracts. In the best-case scenario its a little sus and he is bad for locker rooms or some other intangible we don't know of, the worst-case scenario it's blatant racism.  He's not a starter for sure after his injuries, but the fact that no-one wanted him as a 2nd or 3rd string gaurd is insane."
"I was watching that episode today for nostalgia reasons   Better find a church   A good place to cry   We will not tank or play Frank Nitlikina because Mudiay is our guy   Better find a scept   A good place to pray for all of your sins   Will I overpay Trey Burke or let him walk away (like Jeremy Lin that jerk)   And Oakley is still not welcome back, maybe I‚Äôll resign jarret Jack hell I ll pay the luxury tax to pay Tyreeke Evans the Max, Five year contract ooh  Maybe i should bring Isiah Thomas back! And the small one too for a longer deal!  I think Elfrid Payton is the next Bradley Beal !"
I forgot Trey Burke even existed.
"During the years of he who must not be named, the jazz had jamaal tinsley and trey burke as our guards.  I remember when they brought in shelvin mack from atlanta, who was a third string pg to START for us and I had the same feeling you had"
"NY knows how dumb they look letting KP go for ""cap space"" and ""Durant and Kyrie"" so they are still trying to recover 3 years later with fake rumors.   In the meantime the Mavs made the playoffs and still have thj and trey burke on the lineup because the Mavs understand how to develope players. After all that you will STILL see NY fans saying they won the trade because they made cap space for some bums, got bamboozled for their best players, and haven't made the playoffs in 25+ years. Shits wild yo"
"If we add Smart, Timelord &amp; Pritchard do you think we could get Trey Burke?"
How does it work if I pick Ben Simmons for defense but Trey Burke for size
bit misleading don't ya think?. recent lottery guy was dsj whose value was at its lowest. mavs also got tim hardaway jr. (the guy they initially approached the knicks for) and trey burke. Tim hardaway has been winning team defensive mvp belts and is a strong [6MOTY candidate](https://twitter.com/dmn_mavericks/status/1364085138087415808).
It was horrible in the Jazz days with him and Trey Burke who was also a horrible defender. Was free points every possession for the other team.
Maybe if they toss in Trey Burke and THJ
And Seth curry. And trey Burke.
Thunder legend Trey Burke
"I secretly watch the Mavs bc of the Michigan connections. It‚Äôs really fun when THJ and Trey Burke become flamethrowers dropping random 20 pieces (less common for Burke this year bc Jalen is back), and it reminds me of the other* good days. Michigan basketball is fun!  Don‚Äôt tell my Spurs friends..."
I mean we also got Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr who have been fantastic  Hardaway Jr is averaging 17 points on nearly 60 TS% this season
I fw Trey Burke heavy. Going back to his Michigan days
"We also got Trey Burke in the deal! He's been pretty solid, especially in the playoff's last year."
Trey Burke 30 piece incoming
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).
That means Trey Burke is what 26 and or 27? They were neighbors growing up.
"Possibly, but that's a two time all-star and centers are a bit of a sticky wicket in the playoffs anyway. Drummond might be too dumb and stone-handed on offense and also dumb and easy to toast in the pick and roll on D.  Also it seems like there's always a solid big to be found but wing options are tougher.  Using recent sixers as an example I'd feel a lot more comfortable rolling with Fenerbah√ße's Kyle O'Quinn than the Mavs Trey Burke."
"The Core 4 sounds quaint and delusional at this point, but it was our first set of lottery picks that we ‚Äúearned‚Äù in decades. Of the top of my head, I think Malone was our last.   They were: Rudy, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, and Enes Kanter.  Gorag Hoaghead could be included, but Tyronius The Lesser liked him.   God those were terrible years. Thankfully Q was hired to heal those wounds."

Look it was a foul on Trey Burke so it's a foul on embiid.
"Won 49 games in 16/17 and ended up resting every starter in the final regular season game. Trey Burke and Sheldon Mac almost pulled the win out too, oh well"
For the Wolves 2013 was us drafting Trey Burke at 9 to trade him for Dieng and Muhammad.  Also: never forget the '09 draft *cries in passing up Steph Curry*
"Burke wasn't traded for Donovan, Trey Lyle's was.  The Burke deal was actually one of our worst.  We had two later first round picks and traded them to get Burke, they ended up with Shabazz Muhammad and Gorgui Dieng.  But all the talk in that draft was how Shr√µder wanted to play for us.  We could've had him or Giannis. and not bothered with burke at all.  Now to be fair, same draft we bought back the Rudy rights.  I love him, and he's been great, but dennis lindsay ain't perfect, unless you really like azubuike too."
They tried it a bit with him and Trey Burke last year. Didn't get a ton of action but it did have some success. Same with him and Shake. Certainly not something that happened very often though.
"Combine the swagger of Jimmy G. Buckets, Hops of Ja Morant, and handles of Kyrie with the brain of Trey Burke and you have AI."
"Nope, pretty much not at all. It was almost exclusively THJ, Trey Burke and bigs who found themselves lost 1 vs 1 against Lillard. I can barely remember any moment when DFS was on him in Dame's 61 point game."
i want to find someone who believes in me the way Hubie Brown believes in Trey Burke
Bubble Trey Burke
every trey burke jump shot looks different from the previous one
trey burke always been a bucket
"A combination of luck and skill. Trey Burke was crazy for the westchester Knicks, and out pg rotation was awful. We gave him a chance and he balled out"
Who Trey Burke? U talking about Allen Iverson I assume
Have you seen Trey Burke ? My goodness .   Who he play for ?
"Trey Burke was a rental tho, he left in free agency to the sixers in the offseason after the draft. However, he was waived by the sixers during the season and picked up by the Mavs for the bubble as the Mavs have been shorthanded due to injuries to Brunson, Powell and WCS opting out."
"I'm sorry but you'll have to say Alfonso Clark ""Trey"" Burke III"
"I mean OK, they did a great 25th pick in the draft this year, but they are still a sub .500 team.  2 years after the trade, so likely 3 seasons of sub .500 after the KP trade.  Meanwhile, the Mavs that were also a sub-500 team made a leap to the playoffs. It wasn't just the trade, it was also Luka developing in his 2nd season but still. The Knicks gave THJ and Trey Burke too."
And Trey Burke
"I'm thinking Marks values Harris and a buyout guy more highly than whomever they can get for Harris. So unless they get bowled over by an offer, I don't see Marks parting with him.  Beyond Harris, their most valuable realistic trade chip (outside maybe of distant second-rounders or possibly Nic Claxton) might actually be Dinwiddie's Bird rights (I'm seeing some ppl ITT thinking Dinwiddie will be back this season; that's almost definitely not happening).   The problem with that is finding a trade partner; they need to see themselves as title contenders next year (and thus be willing to exceed the cap) but also willing to part with a presently valuable asset for a guy who can't help this year, and they need to be confident/assured they'll be able to retain Dinwiddie.  I forget which podcast I was listening to (maaaybe Hollinger &amp; Duncan?), but they posited the Mavericks as a team that might have interest in Dinwiddie ‚Äî a guy who can lighten Luka's playmaking duties and be a passable, fairly switchable defender ‚Äî though their recent struggles might make them less likely to deal contributors for this season.   Dinwiddie for Kleber works salary-wise, though I highly doubt the Mavericks would make that deal. More realistically Dinwiddie for Cauley-Stein and one of Trey Burke or Boban works, but again it really depends on what Dallas is willing to sacrifice this year for help in the coming years (plus, Cauley-Stein would also have to consent, though I think he would for the chance at a bigger role on a team some consider to be contenders)."
"&gt; While he's very good at scoring the ball, even the easy buckets look hard for him because of his size.  so? who the fuck cares if he has to work hard to make shots. He's above 50/40/90 for the year. And his playmaking is fine, it's not on par of a secondary ball handler but he's also not Trey Burke."
"&gt;his rookie year was so strong. you could see that he has a control about him that comes natural. It‚Äôs another thing that people are forgetting about the bubble: he was injured and didn‚Äôt play. He‚Äôs honestly been so important for the mavs because he‚Äôs the only other floor general they have. He gives luka someone he can trust to help him run the offense.   &gt;   &gt;This year he‚Äôs taken even another step. His midrange has been insane (never mind his threes) and he gets so many finishes at the rim that look like they have no chance. I love Trey Burke and think he‚Äôs been great - for what he‚Äôs been asked to do - this season, but JB‚Äôs combination of pure point guard plus defense plus shooting is crucial for the team and deserves his minutes over Burke. He‚Äôs only a bench player in name; for all intents and purposes, he‚Äôs their #1 PG.  I think best case scenario, Doncic can play a Lebron-type role. A ball-dominant forward who can co-exist with a true PG. They ask so much of him I legitimately wonder if he's going to be worn down by the end of a full season."
"Well maybe that's the case but I still doubt Baynes would get run over by WCS. If he did I'd be genuinely concerned for the NBA product.   I don't even think Trae flopped tbh. It's a blindside pick and there was always going to be contact. It's a good no call IMO, because if you don't want your screen setter to get run over maybe make sure that he's not one of the smallest guys on the court. If refs blow that whistle then it sets an awful precedent.   I'd just expect Trey Burke to set screens for us in every late game situation and hit the ground. Cause contact right?"
"Honestly thought he‚Äôd be our third best player last season after luka and KP (didn‚Äôt see Timmy going off like he did), his rookie year was so strong. you could see that he has a control about him that comes natural. It‚Äôs another thing that people are forgetting about the bubble: he was injured and didn‚Äôt play. He‚Äôs honestly been so important for the mavs because he‚Äôs the only other floor general they have. He gives luka someone he can trust to help him run the offense.   This year he‚Äôs taken even another step. His midrange has been insane (never mind his threes) and he gets so many finishes at the rim that look like they have no chance. I love Trey Burke and think he‚Äôs been great - for what he‚Äôs been asked to do - this season, but JB‚Äôs combination of pure point guard plus defense plus shooting is crucial for the team and deserves his minutes over Burke. He‚Äôs only a bench player in name; for all intents and purposes, he‚Äôs their #1 PG."
"Sure but the team also re-signed Trey Burke who wasn‚Äôt with the team before the bubble (aka not part of the most efficient offense of all time). I think the intention was adding Burke and JRich gets you something close to what Seth was giving the team in overall output while improving the team‚Äôs defense by adding a sorely needed perimeter defender. Burke has pretty much given exactly what was expected (10+ ppg on good efficiency), JRich has been less efficient alongside Luka, that was not expected. Time will tell if that‚Äôs just how it is or if he just needs more time in the Mavs offensive setup to improve. Unfortunately with this season and after missing like 9 games to COVID, maybe it won‚Äôt happen. But it was a gamble worth taking for sure."
"Just to add on to what you said, it‚Äôs also fair to assume the team peaked with Seth, there‚Äôs no way they were going to do better offensively than being the most efficient offense in the (recorded) history of the game. That in it of itself was only good enough for a 7th seed and a first round playoff exit. The Mavs took a gamble on the trade hoping the combination of Richardson and Trey Burke being re-signed would make up enough for losing Seth‚Äôs offense while raising the teams defensive floor and ceiling. I think early on in terms of defense it was definitely playing out that way, the Mavs were highly ranked in team defensive numbers before they lost 42 man-games to health and safety protocols. But definitely the offensive heights took a much bigger hit than was expected and time will tell if it‚Äôs going to remain that way throughout the rest of the season."
Trey Burke was in the trade as well and had 5pts in 8 min off the bench lol.   Fleeced the Knicks
"Even if KP never plays another game, it's a wash because Dallas got THJ. New York will likely have two draft picks in the 15-25 range, they'd be lucky to draft a player as good as Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke."
"Brunson is best suited running the offense when Luka rests, Josh Richardson isn‚Äôt some consistent shot creator, and nobody should even fathom taking the ball from Luka‚Äôs hands to give more shots to TREY BURKE. From the Mavs games I watched this year, the offense completely stagnates when he doesn‚Äôt have the rock."
Jalen Brunson exists.     maybe don't trade Seth Curry???   let Josh Richardson touch the ball sometimes????   and Trey Burke can't even get touches off the bench.
Like Trey Burke over CJ and Giannis?
I thought that was Trey Burke
Trey Burke
"uhh kleber, THJ and Trey Burke were all good 3 point shooters before luka graced them with his magical presence.   jalen brunson was drafted with luka like what"
I think Killian will have a better mindset than Lonzo offensively coming in. Might have less flash as a passer but he is a more complete player than a scorer like Trey Burke so I could see Killian somewhere in between those two as his floor. Also whose not to say Lonzo doesn‚Äôt slowly keep finishing more I don‚Äôt see why he couldn‚Äôt average 20 on some really fucking good split with all NBA defense. As for Killian peak I have him somewhere between Tony Parker and Rubio that can hit from deep. I don‚Äôt know where he is going to end up but those are my very specific and general left and right limits I assume he may lean towards
"Because we have a good track record with turning scrap heap guys into rotation players and we‚Äôre currently playing Trey Burke minutes. If they can bring DSJ in as a project, as long as he‚Äôs been humbled, I‚Äôd be down to see if he could run the second unit well. Or maybe be a defense first PG."
"mavs knicks rivalry is hilarious  mavs: luv the knicks, gave us tingus pingus and hardaway for dennis smith jr, would you like trey burke for rj barrett  knicks: this is  lakers-celtics"
"I think that is surprisingly easy to answer for the Mavs: Dwight Powell and Trey Burke.  Maybe there is a case for Boban, but he is very situational."
Luka  KP  Tim Hardaway JR  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Willey Cauley Stein  Trey Burke
"I wouldn't call under-construction as poorly constructed. Carlisle is testing out our bench players by playing them against starters of the lottery teams. Brunson has improved a lot but him and THJ aside, the others haven't shown enough this season.    Purely from a contending team's perspective, we only have 5 players signed beyond this season as THJ and Josh Richardson (assuming he doesn't take up his option) are expiring contracts. WCS and Trey Burke have small contracts that expire in 2022 and do not affect the cap space significantly. Powell is the only issue considering that he is nowhere near his old form, has 10M+/y and is signed till 2023."
"Trey Burke on Boban. Make it Happen, Carlisle!"
"The Utah Jazz trading up (with two picks) to get Trey Burke. Not because of Burke, who is still in the league, but because had they stayed pat they likely would have drafted Giannis who was high on their draft board. We then use the second pick to pick Gobert (without needing to purchase it from Denver) and no one scores on the Utah Jazz ever again."
Lol yo we're bad enough that you don't need to hide that we traded Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad AND Gorgui Dieng (the best player of the three.)
"pat beverley light. frank ntikilina pro. young tony allen- old thybulle. hustle of mcconnell, decision making of a trey burke.. all in all not so much. or very much depending on the point of view regarding the subject."
"Probably because it's hard to believe that out of that UM squad, THJ is the only one to have any sort of decent career. Trey Burke, Stauskas, GR3, and McGary have all flamed out to some extent."
"mavs should probably take a flyer try to kill off those trey burke minutes, but they might need burke to regain some value even more"
"Rick has Trey Burke on the roster so in his world, maybe"
You‚Äôre right. The closest we had was Trey Burke
"I wanted to see that 2013 team win so bad. That Trey Burke, Hardaway, Glenn Robinson team was one of my favorite college teams of all time. Still remember that sweet 16 W against Kansas"
BREAKING NEWS : Luka Doncic is a better playmaker than Trey Burke
"Not a Magic fan, but Trey Burke tends to play well against the Magic"
"That's delusional.  Mavs needed a big and a good scorer in KP and gave him a max.  THJ and Courtney Lee were seen as salary dumps, and while we didn't see much of Lee, THJ has shown himself to be worth his contract.  Trey Burke got traded/waived(?) then we got him back in the bubble, where he showed up BIG. He is still on the Mavs.  The Knicks ruined DSJ, traded Wes Matthews and DAJ, and their free capspace dreams of landing KD and Kyrie were nothing but smoke for everyone in NY. Let's not forget how they had more PFs than any other team in the league and no decent guards. All their vaunted capspace clearing got them Randle. Yay.  And how much of their FO that made that trade is still around anyway?  The only saving grace for the Knicks is that they play in the Eastern conference. They'd still be a lottery team in the West."
"Trey Burke looked like a walking bucket back then, and ironically...that‚Äôs all he ever became. Nothing wrong with that, very good scorer off the bench, but being picked that high with his college resume was certainly disappointing.  And in all fairness, no one knew what Giannis would be, including the Bucks."
I thought Trey Burke was gonna be the truth.  I was GLAD we traded picks 14 and 21 to get him.  I'm definitely NOT mad that we could have used those picks to get Giannis and Gobert.
He had a good month with Trey Burke where they averaged 1.4 PPS in pick n roll scenarios.  Trey Burke was a mid season acquisition that took very little time to build chemistry with Beasley.    I'm not sure what he's gonna do now if that Luke Walton black mark isn't coming out of the wash.
"I think you'd be correct if you judged him simply based on his NBA history from 19-25.  He was not a very efficient player.  His handles were suspect for a 3.  His lateral quickness and defensive awareness was abysmmal.  Attitude is one take, I suspect there is a lot of mental health issues going on.   Along with a pattern of graft and betrayal from his own circle early on, there is good reason to suspect that his love of the game diminished during those years.  But he had a really good run in China.  Then he had a good three years from his time between the Rockets, Bucks and the Knicks.  His mid range attempts went down.  His at rim attempts and percentages went up.  He was a 50-39-70 player when he was with the Knicks.  He took two threes a game when he was open, he caught the ball on the wing spots when he isoed and he had a really good pick and roll run with Trey Burke.  He never really worked out as a defensive big in Miami because that requires a level of mental acuity in defense that Beasley simply never garnered.  He played man to man badly with the Rockets, he played zone just about well enough as his team continued to hedge off of corner threes that year and he played man to man with some success at NYC.    He had a rough year with the Lakers where his mom died and supposedly there was a physical altercation in the locker room reported by Shams.  However all players denied that happened.  He was traded to the clippers, then cut.  He got a nod to play for the Nets in the bubble but got cut because he tested positive for covid.  He's been working out in Miami ever since."
legend has it trey burke hasn't made a shot since january
The Warriors signed Trey Burke???
I thought Trey Burke was headed down that route but he seems to have found somewhat of a home in Dallas
"TS Add leaders and trailers over the past 10 seasons:  * 2021: Curry, Westbrook * 2020: Harden, Barrett * 2019: Giannis, Westbrook * 2018: KAT, DSJ * 2017: IT3, Randolph * 2016: Curry, Mudiay * 2015: Curry, Trey Burke * 2014: Durant, Josh Smith * 2013: Durant, Monta * 2012: Durant, Kemba"
"Fair enough but i do think guys like Trey Burke and Seth Curry were playing out of their minds in the playoffs, im not sure they could replace that reduction this year in the postseason. Anyways even with Dallas maintaining position, id still say its an equally difficult conference at worst"
With colleges and the ncaa allowing players to make money off their likeness I think g league will continue to get very few guys. Let‚Äôs face it if you want to increase your brand going to college will do that more than going to the g league will  Trey Burke will always be loved by a pretty large Michigan fanbase no matter what he does in the nba. Same can be said for Tyler hansborugh and North Carolina and other college superstar players
"Part of the KP trade was to take Tim Hardway Jr as salary dump and Trey Burke, and THJ has averaged 16 points per game on nearly 60% true shooting, and Burke has been a decent backup who has won the Mavs a couple games"
"it's kinda crazy that Trey Burke just ""stayed ready"" got the call to be in the bubble last year and just turned that into a 3 year contract."
"That‚Äôs complete bullshit mate.   To be honest I‚Äôd put Trey Burke in the same category as Steph Curry. I mean at the end of the day the only thing Steph has that Burke doesn‚Äôt have is more wins and 3 championships. That‚Äôs it. As far playing in the same level, every night, both ends, shooting inside and outside, fast breaks, transition...Trey Burke has it all."
Yeah but curry does that shit all the fucking time. There‚Äôs a reason why he‚Äôs an all time player and trey Burke is trey Burke‚Ä¶.
"Well, Redick, Boban, J-Rich, and Trey Burke are all on the Mavs so definitely a lot to cheer for as far as former Sixers."
Love Trey Burke but he‚Äôs been pretty nonexistent tonight
"Mavs: Y‚Äôall want Dennis Smith Jr for KP?  Knicks: You‚Äôre gonna have to give us more than that  Mavs: What if we threw in a couple firsts?  Knicks: Shiiiit in that case let‚Äôs give you THJ and Trey Burke too, that‚Äôs way too much  Mavs: No takebaksies"
"Forget that, we're dumb enough to sign trey burke. This FO is awful."
"It ain‚Äôt gonna be us who defend him. Trey Burke has literally even been close to Richardson defensively, with more offensive ability. Carlisle made a great coaching decision to have Burke in to close the game over Richardson."
Why is Trey Burke not playing?
"Trey Burke is like number 11-12 off the bench. Won't get much game time in the playoffs if all others are healthy. Also he is much better for the role,knows his place and doesn't complain. IT sounds like locker room cancer whose useless in the playoffs."
"it hardly counts as winning a trade if you're immediately looking to flip the player you traded for  I'm happy with the result, in fact the guy I miss the most is trey burke"
trey burke is a cool dude  EDIT: tim hardaway jr is also a cool dude
"Then we have a fundamental disagreement on how good we think Isaiah is, because there is no way i think Trey Burke and Cameron Payne are better than him. Not that i think he is a starter or anything, but could he do Burke's job slightly better? Imo yeah."
Denver signed Austin rivers earlier today and Portland needs a defensive guard if anything. And I would rather use guys like trey Burke; Cameron Payne has also been solid for the suns this season.
"&gt; Now let's think about this moving into the playoffs. You normally play 8 maybe 9 players during the playoffs and is Isaiah better than any playoff teams starting and backup guards (also think of fit during this does said team need a more offense or defense off the bench at said position).  Backups? For sure, Portland and Denver don't even have a backup PG and other teams use guys like Trey Burke and Cameron Payne in that role, both of which are easily replaceable by Isaiah."
For me it's always Trey Burke who won ROTY.
Trey Burke: hold my beer
Trey Burke for all-defense?
"It was hounding him offball, and everytime he would call for a screen we'd double. Trey Burke was great on him and stripped him a couple of times. You could see when curry would try to cut offball, immediately someone would bump him and switch on him as well as the person guarding him."
"The truth is that there are a lot of small guards that are currently stuck on the bench or playing overseas, that if given the minutes could produce at a good level.  Trey Burke for example was balling for the Mavs in the bubble, but has until recently mostly got garbage time minutes. The competition for guards who need the ball to be effective is very high in the NBA."
"Yeah it‚Äôs not complicated. Trey Burke put the clamps on Curry, the Warriors had an abysmal game, and you‚Äôre posting shooting splits on 20 points scored after it was a blow out.   Curry had a below average game for his season. Don‚Äôt know why it warranted a discussion."
Trey Burke?
Trey Burke gave up his entire offense to mildly inconvenience Steph this game.
Trey Burke is a fucking bulldog on Steph tonight
Just had a look at the box score and trey Burke is 0-9 wtf
trey burke getting that belt
Trey Burke is making the finals mvp virgin his bitch hahaha
When Trey Burke is out there it‚Äôs hard to get yours
Ah yes trey Burke defensive specialist coming in clutch
Trey Burke is now Gary Payton wtf
"Trey burke starting means we're GOATed, apparently"
Trey Burke actually doing a great job with Steph off ball. Slick Rick does it again
Trey Burke is starting. Is that good or bad for the Dubs?
Trey Burke popping up there is hilarious

"I think MCW kinda won ROY by default tho.  Trey Burke,Mason Plumlee, Hardaway and Dieng all got votes for ROY that says something.  Tyreke is worse IMO because we all actually expected him to be great"
"Fuck the process baby. Results are all that matter. Reality is that trades are always graded with hindsight. Go look at the reaction to the Nets getting Garnett/Pierce/Terry. People thought that was a good trade for them at the time and it is now considered the worst trade in NBA history.   The Knicks signed Randle, Bullock, and Marcus Morris with the cap space created by trading KP + THJ and Courtney Lee. Morris was flipped for the Clippers pick  which turned into Quickely who will make 1st team all rookie if the voters have a clue. Knicks also got Detroit‚Äôs 2nd rounder this year in that trade which will be a very early 2nd rounder. DSJ and Charlotte‚Äôs 2nd rounder (which will be in the mid 40s) was flipped for Derrick Rose who has improved the team substantially.  Gave up: KP + THJ contract + Courtney Lee contract + Trey Burke + 2021 2nd via Charlotte   Received: Julius Randle + Reggie Bullock + Immanuel Quickley + Derrick Rose + unprotected 2021 Dallas 1st + top 10 protected 2023 Dallas 1st + 2021 2nd via Detroit.  That‚Äôs what the trade ended up being for the Knicks. Massive, massive, W.  Fuck KP and more importantly fuck Mavs fans. Luka deserves better than KP but those shitheads don‚Äôt. Getting exactly what they deserved after how absurdly arrogant, condescending, and obnoxious they were about that trade."
"If Trey Burke is gonna ride the bench, it better be our bench"
"That's because it's factually incorrect. Our players will get paid because of Luka's ability to raise their shooting splits when he's on the floor - seriously, check out their numbers when he's off the floor. Our players are just super limited in what they can do offensively - literally nobody can dribble at an NBA level other than Brunson and Trey Burke, and they're both under 6'1. Because of how poorly our players shoot game-over-game, nobody respects them at the 3pt line. So why would Luka set a screen if the defense will just go under and our player will brick the shot anyway?"
Was Neto on the team that year? I think booker and trey Burke might‚Äôve still been there too
The two controversies that season: Replacing Kanter with Gobert and Trey Burke with Dante Exum in the starting lineup! Haha
"Dante Exum and Trey Burke aren't even included!  It was Kanter, Favors, Hayward and Alec Burks that was supposed to be the future star unit for the Jazz. Lol. Crazy how none of these guys ended up being the future, instead it was a late first round pick and a late lottery pick in 2017 after their supposed ""star"" in Hayward left in FA !"
"thats how last year was for us.  Ben hurt, tobias awful, jimmy making the finals, previous sixers going off (Grant, TLC, even Trey fucking Burke).  Every night was just a dunk on us"
"1. I'm not down voting you, but maybe you should take the hint.   2. I'll be honest, I forgot that THJ was in Dallas because I only watch two teams: the Pistons (where Beilein now works, funnily enough) and the Nuggets. I have never cared about neither the Knicks nor the Mavericks.   3. So you can name one. Trey Burke comes off the bench for Dallas. Ignas Brazdeikis doesn't get minutes in NYC. Mo Wagner is behind *Thomas ""I score on my own basket"" Bryant* in Washington. Who even knows where Glenn Robinson III is anymore? Is he even still in the NBA?"
"Fisher coached the most iconic team in Michigan basketball history (the Fab 5), a team that is as iconic as Phi Slamma Jamma, and he produced the second HoFer in Michigan basketball history (Chris Webber). The first is Rudy Tomjanovich.  At the NBA level, the best players that Beilein has produced are Trey Burke and Mo Wagner, backup players at best."
"Relegate to catch and shooting? Did you want Luka to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands - the same Josh Richardson who had more turnovers than assists? Or what about noted turnover machine Dorian Finney Smith, who can barely dribble at an NBA level? Or maybe he should've let one of our 6 bigs handle the ball and playmake? Or what about Timmy, the guy who will either only shoot or drive for a layup? Maybe Jalen Brunson, who was shut down in the playoffs? That just leaves noted DNP Trey Burke and rookie Josh Green as the last 2 players in our regular season rotation - should we rely on them? LeBron in 2018 was incredible but to say that he could get this team to be more than spot up shooters is asking for a miracle."
"Yeah.  Noel seemed like a perennial DPOY contender and Okafor seemed like a perennial scoring champ contender.    Also, even though idk shit about which players will develop and which won't, that 2013 draft was especially weird.  At the time I thought Noel, Shabazz, and Trey Burke were steals at their respective picks...while Giannis and Rudy Gobert got picked behind all of them."
"Absolutely!  I'm not at all arguing that Trez sucks by any means, but him being a ""niche player"" is very accurate, and that niche absolutely will suffer in the playoffs.  Trez is *great* as a regular season player, because he's an iron man player who can be highly efficient against bench rotations.  When rotations cut down, game plans become more pointed at finding the weakest link, and targeting players becomes the name of the game, he'll suffer--on both ends.    The gameplan against Trez is pretty simple: put a singular big dude in the paint to alter his shots and then absolutely hunt him on defense by forcing switches or relentlessly attacking the paint.  Both of those are possible from bench players on *most* playoff teams.  Against Dallas, Carlisle parked Boban in the paint (who destroyed Trez on both sides) and also had Trey Burke/Seth Curry switch and iso onto him.  Against Denver, Malone packed the paint with Plumlee and had guards like Monte Morris switch onto him or Jokic simply take him to the perimeter OR the post.  The Suns would have absolutely done the same shit, but admittedly, Vogel could have tried to use him a bit more due to the lack of big depth the Suns have to defend Harrell.  The issue is more on the defensive end where they have Booker/Cp3/Payne who could easily blow by him or just launch shots on him.  He's useful, but when you really look at the potential playoff matchups, he'll have a hard time.  Frankly, the best matchup he possibly could have had this year was against the Clippers, but even that changed once they got Boogie."
"the Mavs were live-or-die based on how THJ went for most of this year.  You either get 6/8 from three THJ, or you get 1/8 THJ.  It's quite literally the difference between a blowout loss and a blowout win.  Not throwing shade at him because he's paid exactly as he should be as an inconsistent scorer (otherwise he'd be Steph Curry), but it is what it is.  I'm sure that is a deciding factor where these extra 10 shots you're referring to should go, because they sure as shit shouldn't be going to Trey Burke."
"LOL bc maybe i watched this team the whole year and saw no one else being able to playmake, did u not read anything i just wrote? Can u tell me the players who were supposed to do this when jrich and Brunson were so bad they got benched for trey burke? Dfs? Kleber? Yall aren't telling us who were supposed to playmake and yall keep talking about ball movement like hes playing with the spurs. There is no ball movement with these players who can't pass and are catch and shooters. Again tell me who was supposed to playmake?"
"I started watching Game 7 with about 6 minutes left in the 3rd quarter. I saw Porzingis touch the ball in a half court set about 3 times max in that 18 minutes. Trey Burke touched the ball more than him, and he played for like 2 minutes. Somethings definitely off."
You obviously didn‚Äôt watch them with Trey Burke on the floor in game 7 because their second best ball handler (Brunson) was unplayable. Demar is an excellent playmaker these days and he‚Äôd give Luka a ton of relief. Obviously his defense and lack of 3s would be a problem but it‚Äôs still an upgrade Imo
"send us trey burke back, mavs are ruining him"
"This season devolved for a myriad of reasons and I think this trade was part of it, but I think the Mavs overachieved last year to even make the playoffs and didn't get heaps better so it makes sense to me that they made the playoffs and saw an early exit. I believe my prediction to myself (and thus, my season expectation/hope) at the beginning of the season was a 6-seed and a first round exit, so they even outperformed that. Contextually, the only team above the Mavs in the West from last season that got visibly worse (to me) from last year were the Rockets (by a lot), Thunder (by a lot), and Clippers (by not so much and in fact this Clippers iteration may be more successful, who knows, NBA is weird) whereas teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns got objectively better/healthier.  Mavs didn't do very much to make a leap. It always felt like this was the last season of experimentation to me. Try some lineup/player type combinations and see what sticks. I think we learned a lot. DFS took a huge leap in the 2nd half of the season (but didn't really bring it consistently to the playoffs), it's unclear whether Maxi is finally regressing or just too beaten up to be usable, KP is probably not the second star/unicorn they wanted him to be due to injury or mental stuff, but more visibly, we carried 4 nearly unplayable rookies (I like Josh Green and want to see him develop, but I don't believe he's currently an NBA player) a super narrow Boban, and a Trey Burke all season. You just can't have 5-6 guys on an NBA roster who see  next to no minutes other than garbage time and expect to be a deep playoff contender, y'know? That's possibly a roster management issue and I think Donnie's seat is a little hot (and should be), but mostly it says to me that this team was not constructed with the goal of competing for a title and I think that's fine, not every team should be so long as there's a plan for the future (which I do think there is!).  I always believed that the roadmap looked something like this: Year 1 of Luka was just play with Dirk, have some fun, adjust to the speed of the NBA, get the torch passed, etc. Year 2 was letting Luka be the guy for better or for worse, put the offense in the hands of a kid who can't drink in the US yet and see what you have. Maybe get him a potential partner/2nd option if the deal is right and experiment with that. Probably won't make the playoffs, that's fine, who cares. Start collecting some expirings for the next season or two and point towards a FA year that you think could end up strong. Year 3 is the low playoff seed year (unless you use the offseason pre-Y3 to get a big splashy FA, Dallas didn't) and get some experience under the brightest lights. Year 4 is probably the FA target year. You get 1 more season before Luka's superduperubermax prevents you from affording much and requires strong drafting/scouting, so use it wisely. This FA class could've had Giannis (someone Donnie had been vocal about wanting to draft, but Cuban shut down because he wanted cap space for one last title run with Dirk), could still have Kawhi, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo, etc., that's a pretty reasonable FA class to target in on 2-3 years out. Year 4 would be the opening of the window and for as long as you have Luka + 2nd star, you'll be a top 4 seed in the West (provided no injuries or whatever)   I think the biggest deal people don't realize or sweep under the rug with Seth is that he has some red flags. He's nearly 31, wanted starter minutes (Philly did give him nearly 29 MPG this season compared to Dallas' 24.6 last year, which is effectively what Brunson played this year (25)), but has historically been a pretty underwhelming defender in addition to being a low volume shooter. He only averages about 5 3s attempted per game. He's a flashy scorer (and is a Curry) but he takes pretty ""safe"" shots. We have no idea what he looks like with a higher volume if he say, took THJ amounts of shots, because he's just never really done it for a whole season. His line looks a lot like Jalen and I think we'd just much rather have Jalen who is 6 years younger than Curry and still able to develop.  I also digress. Ultimately, I'm sad right now/today/this week, but I think the truth is the Mavs performed as-expected/as-hoped. There were a lot of downs this season (for us AND everyone else, COVID sucks) but some ups too. This offseason is going to impact the future of this franchise likely more than any offseason outside of 2019 and I have no reason to not be optimistic and will continue to be optimistic until proven otherwise and if that happens, we'll go from there I guess."
Rich man‚Äôs Trey Burke.
"Obvioulsy he wouldnt be top of the east lol, east is stacked at the top and Its not like its some kind of a godlike roster. Hunter and Bogi also missed a lot of time and no shit that a team without their (by far) best player offensive would be in the dumpster. I also know Gallinari only really provides scoring, but Mavs play players like Boban and Trey Burke in a similar role. Main point is how bad of a job Mavs FO is doing and how good your is, It really has nothing to do with Luka vs Trae"
"Even if you make the argument that our ""second stars"" KP and CJ played like trash( CJ was still better though) you still have Nurkic, Roco and Powell. We had to play Boban and Trey Burke significant minutes in an elimination game. I am not saying that Luka played better though, both were amazing and I think that despite the fact that they did not advance, theyvwere the best performers in the first round."
Dude we literally have 1 singular consistent defender on the entire roster in DFS. And don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúTrey fucking Burke‚Äù like he wasn‚Äôt great for us in the playoffs last year. The other option was ‚ÄúJosh fucking Richardson‚Äù who been trash all year.
"I 100% agree playing Trey Burke instead of Brunson was a mistake (though Brunson has always struggled against the Clippers matchup), and I don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt play Powell more. Not saying he‚Äôs perfect, no coach is.   Defensively we were fucked no matter what we did though. We just didn‚Äôt have the personnel to guard that team. Once Kawhi and PG started attacking the paint and forced us to go big that effectively won them the series"
Playing Trey Burke in Game 7 was a good one if you're a Clippers fan. Josh Richardson was phenomenal as well!
"""He and Luka""   Stop. Your defensive strategy was straight garbage and he was too insistent on the zone. He went away from Brunson to play Trey fucking Burke in game 7. He is a big part of the series loss. Lue made the right adjustments, Carlisle did not"
Besides Trey Burke did the Mavs bench really play bad or they just not get enough touches since Luka was in for most of the game?
Rick lost this match when he gave Trey burke enough time to throw the game
brunson was not good in this series. i don't blame rick for trying something else. unfortunate that that something else had to be trey burke
"Yeah KP ""13/4/1"" Porzingis , Josh ""Can't make the floor"" Richardson, Trey ""Where am I?"" Burke, Tim ""Coinflip"" Hardaway, Jalen ""Regular Season"" Brunson ain't that bad. Right...."
Thanks for the loss Trey Burke
"Trey Burke completely out of control two possessions in a row absolutely killed us. He shouldn't have seen the floor at all. It was over after his two ""shots"""
I mean Brunson randomly got his minutes snatched by Trey Burke
son of trey burke and nick young
"Quite honestly, Brunson was virtually unplayable this series as well. Seeing him and Trey Burke running around out there instead of Seth Curry pains my soul."
Trey Burke was a huge contributor in the Clippers run.... He had back to back awful plays
I remember dissing Trae Young before the draft calling him a reiteration of Trey Burke. It turns out I was wrong.
"Powell has his issues and the Mavs obviously value the 5 out, but I really don't know how Trey Burke got more minutes."
I don't know how Mavs fans feel about Trey Burke but his two horrific drive attempts in his cameo today filled me with rage. Man came in and immediately went to hero ball.
I don't understand the Mavs play they trying to execute in that span. There are few position where Luka gave the ball to Trey Burke and he just forced his way against Clippers defense.   If they have continued the Luka Boban play it would have stopped the bleeding. They tried that in the last 5mins and they able to get within 7.
From what I remember Trey Burke was great last year in the bubble but as soon as I saw him play in the 3rd quarter he looked lost and cold. Mavs lost the game right there.
Trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson so we have more perimeter defence against teams like the Clippers and then proceed not to play J Rich at all. I mean he‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been playing great lately but surely it‚Äôs better then Trey Burke who‚Äôs done fuck all this season.
"I love the Rick and don‚Äôt want him fired but he honestly did a really poor job tonight. Playing Boban to many minutes, randomly playing Trey Burke who has barely played all season and refusing to stop playing Zone. That being said this team just straight up isn‚Äôt good enough and needs an overhaul."
Why in the hell was Trey Burke in for so long
"The dude deserves to get slandered for the pathetic coaching display he had this game 7. Dogshit rotations (Trey Burke), dogshit defensive scheme. WTF was he doing that entire second half?"
Rick's coaching was absolutely atrocious. Why were Trey Burke and Boban in for so long??
Why was trey fucking burke playing in game 7
Those Trey Burke mins. not going to Brunson is something Carlisle has to answer for
Rick had garbage lineups what was Trey Burke in there for
And also Trey Burke
"Their GM needs to be fired. The fact that they have to play Boban heavy minutes in a game 7 is a joke. Guys like Kleber, Josh Richardson, Trey Burke are completely useless."
He was WAY better than Jalen Brunson and Trey Burke are you serious? And they weren‚Äôt the only guys on the team you‚Äôre conveniently leaving out guys like Ariza Gordon Austin Rivers NeNe Tucker. Stop it lol
Ill take that over a trey Burke drive
"Clippers are just the better team. Pandemic P cancels out tingus pingus. It‚Äôs the guys like **Josh Richardson** , trey burke and maxi that are failing the Mavericks."
that last 5 minutes is a meltdown. Carlisle trying to run an offense where Luka need to give up the ball. Trey Burke tried to drive the ball once he got it.
seth curry and trey burke absolutely sliced clips last year in the bubble
Trey Burke in and tf out lmao üëã
"5 v 1 - (Trey Burke) = 0, I just mathematically solved that run"
trey burke doing his best kyle kuzma impression out there running around at full speed just to give up possession
Why are we playing trey Burke of all people
Game over. WTF! Carlisle trying to run at the end of 3rd? Give the ball to Trey Burke? Lol.
Rick really fucking sold putting trey burke in like dude what the fuck
"Trey Burke, the real X-factor"
That Trey Burke substitution was bad and may have cost them the game
Exactly what we were missing: fucking Trey Burke hero ball.
Trey Burke wants to go to cancun
"Trey Burke wasn't it. Boban looking super gassed out there, but good on him for still hustling as much as he possibly can."
Why is Trey Burke getting minutes in the third quarter of a close game 7
Trey Burke created like an 8-0 turnaround
Did rick call a timeout during that run at all? I would‚Äôve called one right after that first trey Burke shot
Trey Burke is awful
Trey Burke should not be in the game.
Trey Burke 0-3 in 7 and a half minutes being played for whatever fucking reason.
Trey Burke reminiscing about his college days and forgetting he's a scrub on the bench for a reason
Trey Burke is the real mvp
"Mavs are terrible it‚Äôs hilarious, Luka doing everything all game and soon as they start going behind they let trey Burke and kleber start taking shots smh"
OK that‚Äôs enough Trey Burke
Really not ideal to have your season end because you had too much faith in Trey Burke
Yeah idk why trey burke is playing over brunson
"It is, Luka is not aggressive at all despite being the only guy who can consistently score and Carlisle has Trey Burke in the game for some reason when they're getting crushed"
Trey Burke looks like a middle schooler out there lmao
wtf is Trey Burke still doing out there
Trey Burke sucks
An established bum like Trey Burke seeing these game 7 minutes is evidence the Mavs aren‚Äôt there yet.
why tf are the Mavs playing Trey Burke  bruh he aint it
where the fuck is brunson? what is this Trey burke shit?
trey burke killed us in the bubble. but it's not the bubble anymore
Trey Burke need to be glued to the bench
Lol wth Trey Burke doin out there
Trey Burke is an active liability lmao get his ass to the end of the bench
Trey Burke lmfaooooo
Trey Burke is throwing the game
Get Trey Burke the fuck out of there
Trey Burke is pure unwashed ass cheeks
Mavs fans about to murder Trey Burke
Bro why is trey burke not clearing out once Luka get the switch
Why the fuck do you put Trey fucking Burke in a Game 7
Why the fuck is trey burke in this game?
Why is Trey Burke out there
Why is Trey Burke playing? lol
Why is trey Burke still in this game
Trey Burke ass lol
Trey Burke is pure dog water
"&gt; criticizing luka's usage is not criticizing the value of the player, get a thicker skin  Except that's literally what the original comment was doing lol  And you're right, we totally should've had KP handle the ball more, who can't dribble for shit, or post up against guards and usually turns the ball over; or Brunson who was attacked on both ends and pretty much resulted in the Clippers going on a run every time he's on the floor; or Trey Burke who's....Trey Burke.  Is Luka faultless? No, his conditioning is poor and he gets tunnel vision at times, but the fact of the matter is that we needed him to put up 30+ points a game to even have a shot at winning. To imply that he's somehow the reason we lost the series is the dumbest narrative to come out of these playoffs."
I was so excited when we drafted Trey Burke. He was coming off a great tournament performance and we needed a PG. I remember like a week before the draft talking to my boss about the Jazz and saying I really liked Burke but thought we were picking too low to be able to get him. That was probably the most wrong I've ever been about a draft prospect I had a strong opinion about.
"This copypasta from years ago is still one of my favorites -  ""Fuck me with your potential, Let me feel your wingspan, I want to take away your innocence, I want to tell you about taxes, about smoothies, about that bottle in my bathroom that you thought was ranch but really was shampoo because you came from an anthill in greece. Whisper in my ear how you love playing for the bucks, I'll laugh, I'll think its cute, Because I've seen a basketball game and know that the bucks are a pile of shit, But you don't. You're wingspan doesn't. You're potential doesn't. Just because you average 7 ppg doesn't mean you aren't the GOAT. It doesn't mean that Trey Burke doesn't touch himself at night to your highlights. ""Why can't I be him."" ""Fuck ROTY I just want some white kids on the internet to like me."" Let me in. I wanna redraft you until you're ready to finish on my face. I want your potential. Hold me with your wingspan."""
I blame Trey Burke
"This seems like a bad idea. Like OP said don't you want to convince Luka he can win now? Two straight seasons of first round exits. After turning their FO upside down it would be a horrible idea to tell Luka ""oh btw not only did we not hire the assistant that you liked but we're gonna mail-in next season until Kawhi gets healthy, so enjoy running it back with the same team minus Hardaway Jr., Dwight Powell, and Trey Burke"""
The first one that comes to mind is my dad saying that Trey Burke in college reminds him of ALLEN IVERSON.  ALLEN IVERSON
"Clearly, Dirk‚Äôs prime is clear stat wise and in today‚Äôs era he would be even more effective. The fact is that Dirk, even being as humble as he is, was compelled to say this.   Luka gets slandered for his 1st round exits and many use regular season stats/wins against him. I watched all of this turbulent Mavs season and the common problem is that almost half of the nights the team doesn‚Äôt show up to play. They have a ridiculous undefeated record in the regular season of winning a game when they lead in the first quarter. Luka often only unleashes his full effort in primetime games against star matchups. This Mavs team can beat the Jazz or Nets only to lose to the Kings or Rockets. That is because Luka‚Äôs energy is so varying. This is an offshoot of his ultimate looming problem of bad conditioning.   The playoffs are a different story. I‚Äôve seldom seen a player turn on a switch like Luka does. The Mavs theoretically should not match up well against the Clippers and their style of switching in their defensive scheme. The Mavs role players are one-dimensional, but they do their role so well. However, they were simply way out talented by the Clippers. Luka‚Äôs creation for himself and his teammates was all time great. All the players minus Porzingis and Brunson are meant to be catch and shoot players. Both of these players were disappointing this particular series. Porzingis‚Äôs biggest problem was not even offense, but his defense. I hope the Mavs FO adds talent quickly.   The thing that stood out to me most was how Luka played Pat Bev and Zubac off the court. This added with Ibaka being injured convinced me that the Clippers were in a deep hole. Pat Bev who looked unplayable hit daggers against Utah and locked up Devin Booker in the WCF. All I‚Äôm saying is that 90% of Mavs fans would agree that minus Luka, the Mavs would have been in contention for Cade Cunningham. Minus Kawhi, the Clippers won 2 straight against Utah and took the Suns to 6. Would have been 7 if not for an amazing play by Crowder/Ayton.   The part that hurts most is that after a loss to the Clippers in the bubble, the Mavs should‚Äôve been the team that got better in the offseason. They got worse minus Luka‚Ä¶..replaced a highly productive player in Seth with Josh Rich. Clippers who should‚Äôve had depth issues received great production from Batum and the rookie Mann. Mavs FRP Josh Green had no playing time. Brunson who was supposed to help was targeted on defense and locked up on offense. He got benched for Trey Burke. This team played their 3rd string center Boban for 30 minutes in a Game 7.   Luka is far from perfect and Prime Dirk is clearly better but to me hes already an all time great level floor raiser. One thing improved the most for Mavs in the short offseason. That is Luka‚Äôs midrange. How he added that in 3 months and started shooting like Dirk was crazy. I can‚Äôt wait for the future."
"&gt;lack of anyone able to play point  I think Brunson is a great Luka replacement. He just didn't get used much in the playoffs, but he can score, rebound, playmake and he's a good shooter who can get his own shot.  I think the bigger problem is that Luka doesn't play off-ball at all. Most the guards on the Mavs are having career lows in AST% (THJ, Brunson, JRich; worst of all: Trey Burke).  Paint defense...you did have the fewest defensive box outs, fewest rebounds, fewest blocks among playoff teams. I wonder why WCS or even Powell didn't play more. Boban looked good for bits, but the Clippers did go small. Felt more like small-ball paint presence issue, which is a little more annoying and matchup specific."
"Recent History shows the 9th pick as a real mixed bag, for what's its worth, all these players are still playing today (Vonleh might not last past this season). Only 3 of them were basically back ups from the start.  2010: Gordon Hayward (Utah, signed an extension) 15.6/4.5/3.5, made an all star game; 685 games played  2011: Kemba Walker (Charlotte, signed an extension) 19.9/3.8/5.4, multiple all star games, an all nba team; 704 games played  2012: Andre Drummond (Pistons, signed an extension) 14.5/13.7/1.4, all star, all nba, rebounding leader; 645 games played  2013: Trey Burke - starter, then quickly role player  2014: Noah Vonleh - role player, now third stringer  2015: Frank Kaminsky - role player  2016: Jakob Poetl - role player, current starter (usually)  2017: Dennis Smith Jr - starter, now role player  2018: Kevin Knox - role player  2019: Rui Hachimura - starter  2020: Deni Advija - role player"
"(Fake) Rumor has it Utah was going to trade the nickname and their #1 pick via GSW to New Orleans for #1 overall in 2012, and the rights to name their team something bee related (beehive state is utah...)  Golden State fucked it up by tanking the rest of the way so they could keep the pick and get Harrison Barnes. It rolled over a year later and Jazz flipped the pick (Gorgui Dieng) with Shabazz Muhammad to get Trey Burke (oooof)  We could've had the Utah Hornets hanging up their 4th banner next week with AD, Mitchell, Gobert, and Hayward wouldn't have ever left.  And y'all could be making Miles Davis memes and making your Zion dunk plays of the game with Baker Street playing in the background.  I blame Mark Jackson"
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
"I don't understand why people keep saying that the mavs roster is bad. Thj, dfs, kleber, kp was good in the RS when he played, Brunson is pretty decent, Richardson was kinda cheeks, you can do a lot worse than Trey Burke as your eighth man, Powell isn't awful either.  The third most played mavs lineup last szn didn't even include Luka and it had a +22 pt differential. Give credit to Carlisle all you want but the roster isn't that bad."
"Good thing, we took his cap hit and kept Trey Burke instead...right...?"
"Look, you‚Äôve exposed your lack of knowledge by asking why Trey Burke doesn‚Äôt get more minutes - he was absolutely tragic in the playoffs and is basically just there for a veteran presence. Stick to talking about other rosters because you clearly don‚Äôt watch any of ours."
"Luka has KP, Hardaway, Richardson, Brunson, Kleber, Powell, Finney-Smith, Boban, Cauley-Stein, Trey Burke (no idea why he doesn't get more minutes). That's not a bad roster at all. Is it a championship roster? Probably not. But I don't necessarily think Trae has a championship roster either."
"I mean Luka has KP, Hardaway, Richardson, Brunson, Kleber, Powell, Finney-Smith, Boban, Cauley-Stein, Trey Burke (no idea why he doesn't get more minutes). None of those guys are scrubs but they're not world beaters either. Hawks roster might be better but not by much. I just think Hawks roster fits better and has better synergy."
Lol because he has guys who can get buckets outside of isos. Do you want Luka to give Trey Burke the ball with 10 seconds left and let him work? Traes a great passer and distributor but it‚Äôs undeniable his teammates are better than Lukas
"hes right tho every other player literally turned the ball over 24/7 trey burke,josh richardson, brunson were all garbage only luka could be trusted with the ball in his hands against us"
Yk vets exist right üòÇ he ain‚Äôt getting much time over trey Burke and jj barea as a 6‚Äô1 rookie.
He would probably have yk the trey Burke role
Trey Burke
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
"I love the new Reddit feature where after you close the top comment it recommends ‚Äúsimilar posts‚Äù from 4-8 years ago. It‚Äôs interesting to read common opinions from back then, like people were really hyped for Trey Burke."
For the Magic how can it not be Trey Burke.  Or Russell Westbrook.  We are seemingly the only team that don‚Äôt realize Russ can‚Äôt shoot so we defend him out on the perimeter like he‚Äôs prime Steph Curry.
"I don‚Äôt think you can call it a lost art. 21.3% of Booker‚Äôs points these playoffs are from midrange. Of players with at least 4 games and 15 plus mpg, six guys have a higher percentage of their points from midrange than that, nine last year with a higher percentage than Booker‚Äôs now, and eleven the year before.  This year its CP3, KD, Beal, Ish Smith, D‚ÄôAndre Hunter, and Carmelo in that order.  Last postseason, it was Carmelo, Middleton, Seth, CP3, Markell‚Äôs Fultz, Gallinari, Terrence Ross, Trey Burke, and Tyler Johnson.  Luke Kennard, Demar, Monte Morris, Collison, Schroeder, Myles Turner, Ish Smith, Aldridge, KD, Lou, and Klay were the ones in 2019."
"I didn't like the way this post was phrased. Made is sound like the Clippers were getting lit up by Trey Burke and Langston Galloway, it's fucking Luka Doncic and Devin Booker."
I mean he is not wrong. Trey Burke killed us last year. And Boban was a great adjustment. Way harder to attack the paint with him there.
That was fine. Boban was a great adjustment cuz he didn't need flow or rhythm to affect the game. His size is very easy to use. Trey Burke on the other hand was a dumb decision cuz he didn't play for 6 games and he's a score first PG that needs rhythm
Man was an idiot to play Trey Burke and rely on him to play a game 7 when he hasn't played in 6 games. Idiot stats guy. We ain't robots.
What about Trey Burke though? ü§î

"Trey Burke sucked this playoffs and was really valuable for us last year in the playoffs.  Boban had his limitations but was an overall positive impact in getting the Clippers off their game.  People are trying to hate on Haralabos in the wrong way. Dude knows a decent amount about basketball and analytics, that's not the issue. The issue is that he's a dingbat who pisses people off and tries to absorb way too much influence in the org."
"If your analytics guy thinks Trey Burke is the answer, you need a new analytics guy"
"The bubble was weird about a lot of things, but I remember a stat about their offense being even better when he was off the court. But I‚Äôm sure that was because trey Burke went off and not sustainable."
"I‚Äôm a Mavs fan and, I‚Äôd have to really think about it, but might be willing to give up Trey Burke for him."
Why would you hate such a good bball player? Can't you hate a bad one? Like... Trey Burke?
"Yes, but this is just semantics. He‚Äôs making non-basketball plays to get fouls. That‚Äôs flopping.   Next year will be really interesting if and when the NBA legislates this out of the league. I don‚Äôt think Trae is gonna suddenly become like Trey Burke or anything, but there will be an adjustment and he‚Äôs gonna be frustrated for a while."
Carlisle could have not played Trey Burke nearly 10 minutes in G7 after being DNP the entire series. IDK what that was.
I thought trey burke would be really good lmao
"Trey Burke got years and a trade kicker by taking a discount with the Mavs  But really the common way it happens is as a throw-in to a max deal (like AD had one), and as part of an RFA offer sheet to try and stop the other team from matching (Atlanta gave Bogdan Bogdanovic a 15% trade kicker to try and keep Sacramento off matching)"
I remember every time I played 2K14 Trey Burke would invariably win RotY.
We will trade you Glenn Rivers for Trey Burke
"I wouldn‚Äôt say Rick didn‚Äôt try anything in the playoffs, for example the Boban move, but he clearly ran out of options he was willing to try. I‚Äôll never understand why we didn‚Äôt give Josh Green a chance to defend Kawhi in Game 7. We put Trey Burke in, who has been mediocre since the bubble, but couldn‚Äôt give our Rookie a chance. Also never making KP be the focal point on offense killed us at multiple points in the series. He‚Äôs not the kind of guy who can play well out of rhythm."
He played a 2-3 zone and Trey Burke in game 7 against the best 3 point shooting team in the league. That ain‚Äôt management‚Äôs fault.
Wolves can get Dwight Powell and Philly gets Cauley Stein. We‚Äôll thrown in Trey Burke for good measure.
Damn man. Are you sure. We‚Äôll give you trey Burke for Embiid. Sounds fair?
The Trey Burke game. Also known as the Seth missing free throws late in the game game. Also known as the game where Roco outmuscled KP and Maxi.
"Trey Burke.   I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd ever be a top 5 player in the league, but I thought he could be a top 5 pg."
Trey Burke
Trey Burke‚Ä¶
i honestly can't believe i kept watching that team the whole year lmao.  remember trey burke looking like iverson with the cornrows?  i got so bored watching that season i kept a list of every rhyme i heard clyde frazier say.  i still got it buried somewhere maybe i'll dust it off and post it again
"Sure, Dwight Powell, Trey Burke and Tyrell Terry."
"Cuban is turning into Jerry Jones before our eyes.  Title should read ""Mavs have strong interest in acquiring Lauri Markkanen if all they have to trade is shitty overpaid negative value players like Dwight Powell and Trey Burke.""  Same as the Cowboys in free agency every year having interest in players that sign bargain basement contracts."
Few years ago I randomly followed Trey Burke on LinkedIn and he randomly followed me back.  Sorry taught this would most relevant comment I can share this story with.
"His pride killed him when he didn't want to give up the stage for Luka.  Having said that, I'd take him as a Trey Burke replacement, but he'll only get Trey Burke's minutes; which he'll likely not want."
"I'd take him as a Trey Burke replacement, but only if he's going to get Trey Burke minutes, which he likely won't."
Tatum: but wait r/nba told me he is overrated  Trae: not bad for the 16th best young player in the league  Embiid: best big man in the league not even close  Bonus: Trey Burke: ALLEN IVERSON
I feel like this is only part of it. Raptors aren‚Äôt gonna just take back Powell and Trey Burke who have 2 years left. They would be inclined to do it for one of our 2 young players. But Mavs wouldn‚Äôt do that
"Ah yes the Clippers who have Kawhi, Paul George and numerous talented players get pushed to 7 by Luka and... Tim Hardaway Jr? Yeah they truly own us. Clippers just lucky Kawhi choose your sad franchise, because Lebron was already on the Lakers.  Oh and if you gonna say we already beat you in 6, sure. Luka and Trey Burke are tough to beat in less than 6."
THJ. Especially if you already have Trey Burke on your team. Then he goes nuts
May I interest you in one Dwight Powell and Trey Burke?
Trey Burke: 849 points as a Knick  Kemba: 0 points as a Knick.
Trey Burke for a hot minute too
"For that to happen you will be getting Canada‚Äôs own, Dwight Powell, and trey Burke"
"For that to happen you will be getting Canada‚Äôs own, Dwight Powell, and trey Burke"
"For that to happen you will be getting Canada‚Äôs own, Dwight Powell, and trey Burke"
Assets? We would send Dwight Powell and Trey Burke (or WCS) the other way. I wouldn‚Äôt call that ‚Äúassets‚Äù.
"Ric from pawn stars""the best I can do is Trey Burke Im taking all the risk I gotta get dragon framed"""
Come home. Someone call Trey Burke too
Mavs could use a cheap shooter off the bench instead of trey burke
Dallas has \~$33.5M and could get 4 more by renouncing Willie Cauley Stein and 3 if they traded Trey Burke into cap space. So...maybe?
"Tony Snell, Trey Burke, World B. Free and Mike James"
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
Bertans for Trey Burke and Dwight Powell???
"How about we give you Trey Burke so you have a cheap guard to do ... something, anything, while Murray is out."
"McBuckets was a big star in college at least, being a 3x 1st team All-American and consensus Player of the Year as a senior. It's not any weirder to run into a McDermott fan than it would be to run into say, a fan of Jimmer Fredette, Jay Williams, Trey Burke, Jalen Brunson, Frank Kaminsky or Nick Collison - all great college players with underwhelming NBA careers.   Drummond, OTOH, fouled out of his only NCAA tournament game with 2 whole points in 26 minutes."
"Trey Burke.   But maybe only because he reminds me of AI, who was unfairly handsome back in the day."
"Lakers fans, interested in any of:  Jalen Brunson  Josh Richardson  Dwight Powell  Trey Burke  ?"
I dont think Trey Burke would have helped
What do you mean by carry? Like an awful team getting carried? Then probably someone in Georges tier. If you mean carry an average team then a huge number. Trey Burke was the best player in college in his day and hes only improved. Yet he can barely crack a roster.
I thought Trey Burke and Tyler Ennis would be CP3 and DWill. Lol.
"I know they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbusts‚Äù in the typical sense, but I definitely thought Trey Burke and Kris Dunn would be solid starters and more coming out of college."
"1. Giannis : No need to explain why  2. Healthy victor : Otherwise, he's 5th.  3. Rudy Gobert (Have to give some love to a multi-DPOY)  4. CJ : He nice &amp; nicer than the rest.  5. Shroder : Headache at time, but still worth it compared to the rest  6. Tim Hardaway  7. KCP  8.Steven Adams  9. Otto Porter  10. Trey Burke"
From memory rookie Dante Exum started the second half of the season replacing Trey Burke which would have made a big size difference too.
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?   Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
The Westchester Knicks gave us Trey Burke and Langston Galloway. They were better at developing talent than we were LOL
"I did forget Trey Burke actually, that‚Äôs fair. But KP was an All-Star in New York, he‚Äôs clearly been demonstrably worse in Dallas even if he has had his moments."
Conveniently forgets Trey burke and kp 2 seasons ago and kp at he end of last season
"We made one trade with Dallas ‚Äî KP + THJ + Courtney Lee + Trey Burke‚Ä¶for‚Ä¶DSJ + Wesley Matthews + Deandre Jordan + Picks. DSJ is the only guy who stuck with the Knicks(Matthews and Jordan played a combined 22 games for the Knicks), though DSJ was traded for Derrick Rose last year.    Other than that trade‚Ä¶what is this ‚Äúconstantly swapping players‚Äù narrative? This off-season the Mavs signed Bullock and apparently plan to sign Ntilikina, so I understand the ‚ÄúMavericks are Knicks-south‚Äù narrative‚Ä¶with these two moves, and the 3 remaining players from the KP trade, the Mavs might have 5 players on their active roster this season who played for the Knicks within the past few years. But the Knicks will have 0 former Mavs on their roster."
I know people like to shit on frank but he‚Äôs actually a nice fit next to Luka I don‚Äôt know why you are being down voted..?  He‚Äôs alright at playmaking and is good at defense   Who‚Äôs the best guard frank has played with? Tim Hardaway? Trey Burke? Courtney Lee? Derrick Rose last year? Luka is going to be all of the offense of this team and a player like frank fits the mavs future better...  the mavs need to punch up the rest of the roster  A 23 year old Ntilikina fits much better skill set and timeline wise with 22 year old Luka than 35 year old Goran Dragic....
Trey burke still on the mavs?
Trey Burke things^tm
what the fuck was trey burke thinking with that shot lol
"John Wall to Raptors, Dragic to Mavs, Trey Burke and Tyrell Terry to Houston"
i feel that bro. the two players i‚Äôve completely hit the mark on have been Dame and Giannis the twi players i whiffed real hard on were Derrick Williams and Trey Burke
I know it‚Äôs a damn shame. Especially considering the fact that the Ware injury is what made the country kinda really get behind them to finish the job and win it all in 2013 (even though I was lowkey rooting for Trey Burke and Michigan in that National championship).
"Thomas Robinson, Marquis Teague, Trey Burke, Tyler Ennis"
Trey Burke and Tyle Ulis
"Bench vs bench lineups with trey burke and seth curry going off doesnt mean much, plus it was the bubble.     The hawks are 5-4 without Trae this year, and  the mavs are 2-4 without Luka, the hawks also won a playoff game without Trae, ATL is a much better team than the Mavs."
"One or two players change an entire perspective of an organization. For example if Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell weren't so good, I am sure people would be saying the Utah Jazz are bad at developing and/or drafting players after they had Kanter, Trey Burke, Trey Lyles etc for a while. If the Kings drafted Luka, him along with Fox would have change the entire perspective of the Kings. The Spurs have been so good for so long so they get a lot of leeway because they don't get high round picks so we really don't know and they hit it big with Kawhi. If Spurs had the 4th or 5th pick in the 2013 draft for example, I wonder who they would have picked and if that player would have turned out to be a game changer."
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
Best I can do is Dwight Powell and trey Burke
Maybe replace trey Burke with IT
"MCW he flipped quickly, that move is fine.   Hinkie was out before the Simmons pick. We are really talking Embiid, Nerlens, and Jah. One great, one fine for the draft, and one bad.  Right after Nerlens were  7. McLemore 8. KCP 9. Trey Burke 10. CJ 11. MCW 12. Adams 13. Olynck 14. Shabazz  Sure you can say he should have taken Giannis but that‚Äôs a 1 in a million. Draft just sucked."
Trey Burke. I bought his rookie jersey thinking he would be the next big thing. Still wear that jersey with pride even though he shat on Utah.
I'd feel bad for thinking Oleskiy  Len and Trey Burke would be superstars but everyone from that draft fucking blows and I was really high in Giannis
"Trey Burke, Hardaway Jr, Marcus Morris, Melo, Porzingis  For Pg the options are: Burke, Ntilikina, Dennis Smith, elfrid Payton, mudiay (?)"
"""What does a bean mean?"" - Trey Burke"
"There‚Äôs something so humorous about Trey Burke, Faried, and The Dream sharing a court together"
slightly use trey burke? thank you :)
unleash Trey Burke
free trey burke
Mavs for Trey Burke. Lakers need shooters
Like a slightly better Utah Jazz Trey Burke type.
"Luka ^^^Samanic, Trey Burke, and Ja Rule"
"mavs took THJ, KP, reggie bullock, trey burke and frank ntilikina from us  its only fair they send us luka, 1 for 5 thats more than fair"
Trey Burke reminding me of AI
trey burke is not vaccinated right?  that might not work out well in canada
"The Ljubliana Mavericks at Dallas still want him. We shall send a mighty offer of Jaquori McLaughin, Trey Burke and Willie Cauley Stein.   I'll have my guy call yours."
"He's projecting his anger so that he knows what to do when he matches up with Trey Burke, Kyrie and Real Deal Beal."
"Trey burke on the mavs.  Schroeder wasn't while on the lakers, now he is on the celtics"
"I don't disagree with you, but it's weird that you'd single out Richardson for being too mediocre in a comment that also mentioned Trey Burke."
"Trey Burke, Josh Richardson iirc"
Jordan Poole is what I wanted trey Burke to be so bad
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."
We can offer a fairly used Dwight Powell and Trey Burke
Trey Burke left his mark on 2k for sure. His base is still great to this day
"I mean we need a perimeter defender though so Ntilikina adds a valuable depth piece to randomly plug in at times. With Jalen Brunson, there is a bit less of a need for Trey Burke in the context of our roster."
"&gt; I mean I would rather Frank Ntilikina than Trey Burke.   What a scathing indictment of Trey Burke. For the record, here's Trey Burke's 2020-2021 matched up against Frank's best cherry-picked stats from any of his seasons:  Burke - .428/.354/.895, per 36 minutes: 16.2 points, 3.1 assists, 2.1 rebounds; .544 TS%, 12.6 PER, 0.0 VORP, .071 WS/48  Frank - .393/.479/.864, per 36 minutes: 10.8 points, 5.3 assists, 3.7 rebounds; .512 TS%, 9.8 PER, 0.0 VORP, .070 WS/48  Remember, I cherry-picked Frank's stats (fg% from 2019-20, 3PT% from 2020-21, for example; should be noted that the .479 is a small sample size of 23 three-pointers all season) and Burke still comes out slightly ahead, imo. Does Frank have more potential? Maybe. But if push came to shove, I think I'd still go with Burke."
Him and Trey Burke were monsters in 2k14
"Lol, Jonathan Isaac and Trey Burke both left it at personal choice and that didn't stop anyone from caring. Only reason Kyrie is getting more attention is because he's a star and a lot of people already didn't like him."
I mean I would rather Frank Ntilikina than Trey Burke. But in no way am I expecting Frank to play many meaningful minutes for us. But it's not like he's really costing us anything.
No it‚Äôs Trey Burke
"This is fairly obvious in hindsight but it's amazing how many people on this sub didn't rate Luka at the time of the draft, it was crazy how many archaic takes about how ""you can't teach size"" and ""you gotta go with the center #1.""  Worst 2 that I was so incredibly wrong about were Trey Burke and Ben McLemore. Oof."
"Kyrie, Simmons, Bradley Beal, Bazemore, Trey Burke, Kuzma to the Kings for I don't care who.    I want a team that can only play like 50pc of the time max, and the rest of the time they are filling in with G Leaguers. Just to see what would happen.    Marbury to coach."
"He isn't that good  Trey Burke is also doing it, who gives a fuck lmao"
"Putting unvaccinated kids at risk. In Trey‚Äôs case, Mark Cuban feels like his kids are in close enough proximity that he‚Äôll make sure everyone around them are vaccinated.  If that means cutting Trey Burke than, lol, that‚Äôs easy as fuck. Cut him, sign a G Leaguer, lose nothing."
"Yeah Trey Burke is so expendable. But he's money is guaranteed, but it'll fuck over his chances at getting another contract if he doesn't play at all this year."
Why give up on either when you have an easy cut target in Trey Burke right there?!
The funny thing is: most of those guys would probably tell that they don't know shit about the virus since they studied sports medicine or orthopaedics and had virology just in a basic course at the beginning of their studies. At the same time Trey Burke and Kyrie act like they know shit. Dunning-Kruger in full effect.
Could Trey Burke sue over this now that Abbott is signing that law prohibiting vaccine mandates?
"Imagine being an actual researcher busting ass to research covid 19 and the vaccine, doing scientific studies, using various sources to corroborate your efforts, double and triple checking everything, having your work be peer-reviewed and then published in a scientific journal, only for Trey fucking Burke to say he needs to do more research."
"I know that but it‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs getting fed up w Trey Burke here, and that‚Äôs who he‚Äôs referring to when he says ‚Äúemployees‚Äù   All his employees are already required to be vaccinated. Everyone‚Äôs are"
"In the case of Cuban's employees, he can force them to get vaccinated or be fired.  In the case of Trey Burke, he is not an employee, but a contractor. Cuban can end that contract or trade it for any reason at any point. NBA players are not employees ever, they are Trade Union contractors."
Those poor employees at the Trey Burke Institute
"Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant he technically can‚Äôt force him to get a vaccine, but he‚Äôs under no obligation to employ Trey Burke"
Didn't the texas governor ban all vaccine mandate? I don't think Mark Cuban can force Trey Burke to get the vaccine now. https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/texas-governor-covid-vaccine-mandate-banned-1.6207561
Trey Burke in his lab as we speak
"If Trey Burke gets cut, is his NBA career over? Outside of his play in the bubble, I feel like he‚Äôs been pretty bad for the Mavs"
Cuban says ‚Äúfuck Trey Burke‚Äù more at 8
He can be a backup PG on a decent team. He's better than other ones I think. Like Trey Burke on Dallas.
I was definitely wrong about Trey Burke but that was a case of buying into tourney hype.  I was right however about Steph even though that was also tourney hype.
The Mavs should show mercy and trade Trey Burke for him. We're willing to make that sacrifice.
"Top 5? He was consensus top 10 at most.  But truth be told, outside of Oladipo and Nerlens pre injury, there was no consensus for the top 10. They were being mock drafted all over the place.  Like before the draft happened, blog bois were saying Cleveland would pick Alex Len lmao.  My point is more that, Giannis had incredible upside and no one looked like an obvious pick. So if you were going to take a chance on Bennett, why not go for a guy with even more upside but just less guaranteed success? It was a shitty draft, so there was no point picking one of the ""guaranteed"" guys because all you were getting was a role player at their best.  I felt like this for the entire top 15 outside of Dipo. I still don't get why some guys got picked over Giannis, they looked more raw and had way less upside. McLemore, Trey Burke, Adams all looked worse than Giannis did at the draft.  &gt;Even from a purely athletics standpoint there was quite literally no reason to pick Giannis over Bennett.  Someone hasn't watched pre NBA Giannis. Anthony Bennett is one of the least spectacular prospects athletically that I've seen. Giannis is one of the most, his athleticism even without Basketball skills would make him a fringe NBA player/high end D league player."
Cut Trey Burke and move along with things
Lol the Trey Burke the Sixers waived in 2020 before going back to you guys?
That's why he said models. You don't model your game around Trey Burke.
We can solve this whole thing right now and trade Trey Burke for Simmons.
Dante Exum and Trey Burke
Okay I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you I‚Äôm just saying media is to generate clicks. Who gets you more clicks trey Burke or kyrie? Exactly kyrie therefore media will only care about him. It‚Äôs not that hard of a concept to understand
Now I feel bad for Trey Burke. No vaccine AND no attention. Damn.
No one gives a shit about Trey Burke. He can wake up tomorrow and realise he got cut for it.
surprised Trey Burke is still holding out lol
The NBAPA are fighting for guys like Trey Burke and Kyrie.
I remember when Trey Burke was the best PG we had.
Trey Burke for Simmons. Who says no?
let's hope philly is interested in Trey Burke.
Trey Burke isn‚Äôt good enough to be traded‚Ä¶
"Trey Burke is on that team.   Until he gets traded or cut, i guess"
"No offense intended beyond the obvious, but I'm not sure Trey Burke had much trade value *before* he painted himself into this particular corner."
Trey Burke being cut with extra steps.
Trey Burke
"Seriously, Trey Burke isn‚Äôt good enough to be anti-vax."
I heard on Instagram that noted immunologist Trey Burke actually runs a NIH-funded lab
"Ok so should we all just do nothing and not get vaccinated at all because it won't be 100% done? How many people do you know who currently have Spanish flu, Polio or Small pox? I'll wait.    Their's not misinformation coming out of the left... they're just trying to to break it down as simple as possible for all these ignorant morons that think watching YouTube and Tiktok is somehow research. That they somehow can do equal or better research then experts and people who have literally taken an oath to protect the health of the general public. Do you really think Trey Burke or Kyrie know how to access PubMed or even how to properly comprehend the information they would find from the peer reviewed studies? Do you think Kyrie is analyzing covid virus/vaccines at his home bio-lab?    But then ""centrist"" people like you twist the information by going ""WELL ACTUALLY IT WOULD ONLY BE 95% DONE SO TECHNICALLY THAT'S MISINFO"". That's right wing propaganda lol. Because the right tried to use this as a political event to rally their base and win over undecided's under the guise of ""mah freedoms!"" and ""gOvErNmEnT tYrAnNy"". Which is really ironic because if Trump had actually listened to the science at the time, and supported the people properly and leaned into handling this shit properly he probably would have won a second term.   You can only achieve herd immunity with vaccines, and 90% of people in my region(and a lot of other places) that go to the hospital are unVaccinated or waited around a long time to get vaccinated and caught it after the 1st shot.  People in 3rd world countries are literally begging for vaccines.   In my mother country I have lost so far 4 relatives to Covid and another in a coma who's starting to to wake up and doesn't know that her special-needs daughter is dead from the same illness that put her into the coma.   All because of lack of access to vaccines and because of the religious right in my mother country waiting to approve them until their candidates came into power so they get credit.   The special needs daughter had bought a bootleg vaccine off the street to help protect her mother and look where the two of them have landed.  This is the type of shit people are going through to survive and fight this shit and yet here we have literal millionaires promoting the idea that theirs two sides to this shit...They could hire scientists or doctors to explain this shit and teach them but they don't. Ita a farce.   It's FDA approved, its widely available, side effects have been outlined and proven minimal, the virus has been sequenced, we have already seen variants coming from countries that weren't properly equipped.  Unless you're part of the 5% of people that can't take it medically (thus requiring a herd immunity to be safe) then you have no good reason to not take it. And especially no good reason to sit there and try to play contrarian as if both sides of the argument make sense.  Ps to the ""my body my choice people"" . Are you fighting this hard for abortion laws? Has Kyrie or Wiggins said anything about that? Have they ever spoke out about having to get shots to go to specifics countries? When I immigrated to NA I had to get 2-3 different shots as a 2 year old. When I was in high school we had to get meningitis and HPV shots or else we couldn't attend class. So this shit isn't new. What's new is ignorant assholes having a platform to spread bullshit and muddying the waters."
Trey Burke needs to study the effects of the vaccine to know it‚Äôs safe just like I only need to play a little more basketball before I get into the NBA
"I mean, isn‚Äôt there at least a *chance* that one of the side effects will be to make Trey Burke a good basketball player?"
"Dr. Burke in March 2020.  ‚ÄúF*ck a vaccination,‚Äù Burke‚Äôs Instagram Stories began. ‚ÄúTryna kill us YOU [emoji eyes] you crazy you think otherwise!‚Äù  He continued by telling his followers to ‚ÄúPick a side‚Äù before explaining that he would rather put his faith in his religion. ‚ÄúI choose the Most High through Christ could careless [sic] what the world think [shrugging emoji].‚Äù  Burke went on to suggest he didn‚Äôt care what anybody thought about his opinion on getting vaccinated, something he likened to radio-frequency identification (RFID)  Burke said ‚ÄúRFID in full effect and they ready to implement!‚Äù  https://newsone.com/3916579/trey-burke-anti-vaccination-theory-amid-coronavirus/"
"No one was trading for trey burke with or without the vaccine. His ceiling is bench guard, and his biggest fan doesn't think he's coming close to 6moty. Who trades for that?"
Someone pls drop trey Burke nudez. They still out there
"Ughh. You were one of my favorite players, and I rooted for you so hard. Please stop being stupid and get the damn shot.  Michigan has some idiotic alums - David Portnoy, Ann Coulter, and now Trey Burke.  \*note idiotic does not equal sadistic like Ted Kaczynski (also proud Michigan grad)."
"This is why the NCAA sucks. Every other person who went to a top school thinks they earned it like everyone else. No motherfucker you are dumb as shit but you can put a ball in a basket better than most and that makes them a lot of money.  You ""studying"" isn't going to tell you shit unless you have a wealth of information related to said subject informing the  covid studies. Trey Burke is bullshitting just like the rest of the antivax, personal choice asshats in this dumbfuck country."
"Whoah whoah water ""treatment""? See, that's how they control you. Flouride, chlorine, probably the Soros/Gates 5G DNA manipulation agent.. Who knows what's in there.  Like Trey Burke, I only trust holistic naturopathic water. Schlepped by hand down from the Sierras and imbued with naturopathic immunity boosters, one molecule per trillion liters."
Trey Burke wasn't scared to take that shot against Kansas but won't take a shot that could save lives   SMH
"I have done my own research and believe I am a better basketball player than Trey Burke. It's my choice, and all my sources lead me to believe this too."
"Trey wants to control the narrative. He released a bleached out PR statement to try and get people to view him in a certain light. It's not a witch-hunt, it's a counter narrative to the story HE wants to tell.   If it's a witch-hunt, Burke started it."
"How much would you love to see SupremeDreams make a video of NBA players talking about the COVID vaccine? I'd love to see a scene of geniuses like Trey Burke, Kyrie, and Wiggins talking about it, and then maybe KAT and some others come in and scream at them..."
"Nah that‚Äôs his PR answer. This is what he said last year during lockdown.   ‚ÄúF*ck a vaccination,‚Äù Burke‚Äôs Instagram Stories began. ‚ÄúTryna kill us YOU [emoji eyes] you crazy you think otherwise!‚Äù  He continued by telling his followers to ‚ÄúPick a side‚Äù before explaining that he would rather put his faith in his religion. ‚ÄúI choose the Most High through Christ could careless [sic] what the world think [shrugging emoji].‚Äù  Burke went on to suggest he didn‚Äôt care what anybody thought about his opinion on getting vaccinated, something he likened to radio-frequency identification (RFID) ‚Äî tracking devices ‚Äî that by definition uses ‚Äúelectronic tags placed on objects, people, or animals to relay identifying information to an electronic reader by means of radio waves.‚Äù Burke said ‚ÄúRFID in full effect and they ready to implement!‚Äù  https://newsone.com/3916579/trey-burke-anti-vaccination-theory-amid-coronavirus/"
Hypocrisy from 8 years ago? If trey Burke were to ever give a shit to reply to this he could just say ‚Äúyup I was younger then my mind has changed since‚Äù...back to square one lol. Or just say he has a different view when it comes to surgery. I get what the poster is saying but they also come off almost pathetically pressed lol.
"Nuance is not allowed on the internet anymore. I don‚Äôt think Trey Burke is anti-vax. If he doesn‚Äôt want to take the vaccine, he shouldn‚Äôt have to and no one should care that he doesn‚Äôt. But, if his team or the league mandates it, they have every right to not let him play, or release him. It goes both ways, the spotlight each player gets is so ridiculous."
"The point is that, these players trust the government, and doctors to have surgeries, get PEDs and have been vaccinated for school for years before coming to the NBA.  Trey Burke in particular rejects the ‚Äúpharmaceutical products‚Äù, yet he opted for finger surgery, which in most cases is done with anesthesia.   It is hypocritical for him to reject the covid vaccine because of mistrust, for a worldwide pandemic that has killed many and his hesitation puts many at risk. Yet he did not hesitate at all to trust doctors for his injuries."
"Gotcha Trey Burke, you're an idiot."
Trey Burke isn‚Äôt a good enough player for this stance. He‚Äôs gonna get replaced with a vaxxed g leaguer
Apparently Trey Burke ain't relevant enough to warrant that in this thread lmao
Well I mean...do you know that or are u just assuming you know how Trey Burke has trained during his NBA career?
Talking like a straight dummy who watched a few youtube videos on hollistic medicine. Hope Trey Burke finds himself out of a job soon - that might change his tune.
This is a really stupid take from Trey Burke BUT at least he‚Äôs aware enough to say that he‚Äôll take the protocols seriously knowing he‚Äôs unvaccinated. Unlike Cole Beasley saying he‚Äôd rather die from Covid living his best life.
"Man I truly hate Ronald Reagan for what he did to education. Reagan defunding public schools and education is a main reason why pseudoscience and conspiracy theories have taken over a good portion of the country in the last 30+ years. Do these people not realize how much modern medicine has prolonged the lives of American citizens? Like when Trey Burke got that MCL sprain, I bet he didn‚Äôt go the holistic route then."
Trey Burke bout to be naturally out of the league
Trey Burke was laid to rest tonight  He died from this comment
"Andrew Wiggins, Trey Burke, MPJ"
"&gt; Trey Burke's season began with an apology Monday, after nude photos of the Utah Jazz point guard were leaked on the Internet and spread over social media. ... The photos, which did not show the player's face, apparently surfaced online a few weeks ago but spread suddenly late Sunday night, leaving Burke and the Jazz with a social media drama for its Media Day."
Kidd said coaches are 95% vaxxed and expect to be 100% or close by start of season  Trey Burke is the only player not vaxxed and he doesn‚Äôt plan to get it
Unlike MPJ Beal Kyrie and even Wiggins Trey Burke is not good enough to publicly be an anti vaxxer lmao  NBA just gonna kick him to the curb
Gonna be a long year for Trey Burke
No that's Trey Burke
"I think the problem is there seem to be no exceptions for recovered people. As I understand, different us states have different rules. Even though  I am vaccinated (and all my family and friend except one), I think that after all we know about covid recovery, young recovered (otherwise healty, which nba players are) people (lets say below 50) shouldn't be forced into vaccination. There is much evidence they have a better protection than only vaccinated individuals (in my country \[small central european country\] we have almost zero recovered people who got the second infection and were hospitalized) . Thats the case of Trey Burke from the Mavs for example. He was infected last year and does not want to be vaccinated."
Also a 2k15 demigod with unstoppable backcourt mate Trey Burke. ‚ÄúBurke over to Burks back to Burke. And it‚Äôs Burke for 3 credit the assist to burks.‚Äù -Kevin Harlan
"That was a straight up beat down. All role players need to go if they‚Äôre gonna shoot like shit and not play defense.  Fuck Trey Burke, specifically tho"
Fucking trey Burke
"Nobody is truly great at it. I just know when he played the Mavs last season, Trey Burke had a really good series of plays against him. Played him great. But other than that, he's unstoppable."
"trey burke killing it, I love that guys game even if he's an antivaxx moron"
"I hate Trey Burke, bonafide scrub, but I always hear about ‚Äòhow good he was in the bubble‚Äô and i didn‚Äôt see that at all. I want him gone, also WCS and Powell"
"Have you seen any games at all? We have fucking Trey Burke running iso plays with 4 different shooters waiting for the ball to just shoot. The team without Luka is mediocre af. They literally can't win because of guaranteed failing in the 4th quarter, pretty evident in both games vs Phoenix and the first game against Clippers."
"Trey Burke is probably the closest thing we have to this. Willie Cauley-Stein frustrates our fan base to no end, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs disliked. Also - shoutout to Dwight Powell for people hating the role he gets out in (although he‚Äôs very well liked as a person)"
"You just called THJ, Frank, and Trey Burke.  P.s Courtney Lee also."
"Lmao, Morris thought Trey Burke was wide open."
trey burke is pure trash
Anti vax trey Burke
Isn't Beal the only real known impact player? Kyrie aside for obvious reasons. Who cares if Trey Burke doesn't play against the Raps.
"You‚Äôre right, we‚Äôre better off with Trey Burke out there"
"Back before I got so depressed I went to a lot of games and sat really close to the court, and it's actually college Trey Burke for me. Would routinely ""put the team on his back"" and win games in crunch time repeatedly. I know yall don't like college basketball and will laugh but whatever."
"Still doesn‚Äôt explain the Charmin soft push off call on Trey Burke, but yeah I guess"
"If Luka plays and we shoot at least 39% from 3, we win this game. The zone and Trey Burke fucked it up"
"You can say a lot of things about Trey Burke, but you can never say that man is afraid to take a shot‚Ä¶.  Oh wait"
"Yup, big Trey Burke fan here. We're actually doing research together."
"Literally the lottery Knicks with Porzingis leading them with frank, bullock, thj, trey burke"
Yes. Imo they need some more scoring off the bench so a Nance for Trey Burke should do it
"We have to take Dwight Powell and Trey Burke back to make a deal happen with Dallas, I'm not taking just a 2nd to take back their 14 mill guaranteed money next season."
"Trey Burke, Dwight Powell, Josh Green, WCS"
"I‚Äôd rather Trey not see the court, but we could legitimately run an all ex-Knicks lineup of Trey Burke, Reggie Bullock, Tim Hardaway Jr, Frank Nkilatina, and Kristaps and it wouldn‚Äôt be half bad"
They have to be willing to give up assets because their only salary filler is Dwight Powell and Trey Burke who both have another year after this one. That's what stopped it from getting done in the offseason. They wanted us to give them Dragic for nothing but we wanted something to take on their shit salary filler.
We‚Äôll give you Trey Burke(?)
Lmao Trey Burke played 2 minutes after being out for 2 weeks. His unvax'd ass is about to miss another 2 weeks
"we have slightly used Trey Burke if you want to make PO push, cavs. just give us your late 2nd :)"
Allonzo Trier/Langston Gallaway/Trey Burke/Frank Ntlikina/Dameyean Dotson/Kevin Knox/Quincy Acy/Kristaps Porzingis is the future of the Knicks and a future all star.
Trey Burke is Alfonso.
"Strengths: having a star player   We have a Luka   Let's us have a little leeway and just spam letting him run things when everything goes to crap   Weakness; Bench PG handler and Center  As everybody knows. Brunson ha stepped up big for the Mavs. And everybody wants to start him, but truthfully, if he start, the bench he no true PG. Frank has played better as a wing handler and Trey Burke is more of a shooting guard in a PGs body.   Ideally for the Mavs   Starting lineup has Luka, Brunson, and KP  With Tim hardaway, Bullick, and Kleber off the bench   The center starting positions for us is ass   Dwight Powell wouldn't start on a single ofher nba team in the league, but he starts here"
Making room for Powell + Trey Burke.
[The Trey Burke 3 pointer against Kansas in the Sweet Sixteen](https://youtu.be/b5RK8ED2CUY)
Pretty sure Trey Burke is literally not allowed in Canada until he gets vaccinated lol
"Even better, we'll give you the 9th pick of the 2013 NBA Draft! Trey Burke himself."
Trey Burke not being able to suit up for a game has a better defensive impact than I.T actually suiting up for a game.
TIL Trey Burke is still in the league
It would still be Trey Burke.
"reminder that Trey Burke was a lottery pick taken ahead of: Giannis, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert, Tim Hardaway JR, Dennis Shroder and never averaged more than 12 PPG, with 6.6 PPG and 5.3 PPG in the last 2 seasons."
"Definitely not a point guard, but I think he would be a better third sting guard to call on then Trey Burke who won't show up to his mandatory COVID tests."
"Isn‚Äôt Trey Burke always a borderline case of being out of the league season by season? He better relax before he‚Äôs a starting guard on a Euro league before the end of the year, lol"
We'll give you Trey Burke and you'll like it.
Trey Burke then.
Josh Green or Trey Burke?
"Hardaway jr, Ntilikina, Trey Burke, KP. 3/4 ain‚Äôt too bad"
"Excuse me, that roster has Trey Burke and Dwight Powell. Anything but shit"
all 3 having similar sounding starts to their names is actually legendary and an announcers nightmare  i mean shit our guy struggled like hell with trey burke and alec burks. add a 3rd guy? your fucked mate
"Trey Burke was the Mavs 2nd best player tonight. Yes, it was that ugly."
Trey Burke from the Mavs just did
You guys don‚Äôt have noted Magic slayer Trey Burke.
"Watching the Mavs is like a bizarro world where the Knicks landed Luka in the lottery and it answers the question of how good would we be with a core of THJ/Luka/KP and role players like Courtney Lee, Trey Burke, and a scrub like Frank. I just don‚Äôt see a contender."
"**Better find a sept**   **A good place to pray for all your sins**  **Will I overpay Trey Burke or let him walk away?**  **Like Jeremy Lin, that jerk!**    **And Oakley is still not welcome back,**  **Maybe I'll resign Jarret Jack**  **Hell, I'll pay the luxury tax**  **To give Tyreke Evans a max!**"
I know Trey Burke and KP are out but this still looks bad
Lmao Trey Burke ain‚Äôt good enough to to be doing that
Trey Burke is not it Rick
I'm really not understanding these Trey Burke minutes
Why is trey burke getting minutes
Why is Trey Burke being the way he is
Why‚Äôs Trey Burke in the game
Trey Burke wow
Trey Burke randomly getting minutes today is concerning
putting in Trey Burke is a desperate move. at least rest Luka a bit
Trey Burke over Jalen Brunson is interesting
What the fuck does Trey Burke possibly add to this team?    What a fucking weird desperation move by Carlisle.
I will never understand why trey burke is getting minutes in the playoffs dude hasnt hit a meaningful shot all year and plays horrible defense.
Trey Burke is trash as Josh
why are they going with Trey Burke over Brunson
IDK IF TREY BURKE IS IT RICK!
Trey Burke?????
Happy to see Trey Burke getting some time in this game. He was one of my favorites when he was on the Knicks.
Bubble Trey Burke was so good
Trey Burke ‚ù§Ô∏è
Trey Burke pretty as shit
Brunson is ass against the Clippers. Thats the worst matchup in the league for him.  Honestly i would try secret bubble weapon Trey Burke in game 7. In the playoffs you need players that can create. Burke might be able to do that.
Trey Burke for Brunson.
"He's literally the only playmaker on the team. The closest thing to a secondary playmaker they have are guys like Brunson, Richardson, and Trey Burke."
"Quick question, Trey Burke was so good for DAL in the bubble vs the Clips. How come he isn't playing at all?"
porzingis+trey burke+ THJ
Trey Burke 10-13 26 points masterpiece!
"First, I like Curry a lot.   People here keep talking about his playmaking.  I sure don't remember he doing much of that at all.  Less than Brunson and maybe on par with Trey Burke last year."
"The mavs had Kleiber, Deandre Jordan, Harrison Barnes, trey Burke, and Tim hardaway Luka‚Äôs rookie year. The hawks had JC and who?"
Lol the same reason Trey Burke and MKG got minutes. We were missing our first 2 guys off the bench. Somebody has to play haha. We alternated between no defense (Seth/Burke minutes) and no offense (MKG minutes).   But you watching some highlights and checking the box score is the perfect summary of this sub.
Oh Trey Burke plays pickup with you? Thats rly cool
FUCK just put Trey Burke in and hope he can hit some.
"Bubble Trey Burke instead of J Rich, come on"
Powell in for Trey Burke is a great adjustment so far
Imagine trading Seth curry thinking trey Burke is the solution
"They went defense heavy but with no shooters. Can't win that way unless LeBron and AD are playing like superstars. Granted, they did play like that last year but I think it's time to change things up. I legitimately believe Lakers would be better even with Trey Burke than Schroder."
"You're comparing free throw counts between a team that is known for not fouling with one that plays a consistent press. Of course one team will shoot more.  Burke had three separate fouls in that game that were all questionable.  The first should have been a goaltend, the second should have been a no call,  and then this.  Yes, Spike got to come in and play the half of his life, but we have no idea how the flow of this game goes if Trey plays 40 minutes.  Meanwhile Hancock's fourth foul was switched to Harrell and we know what happened after that.  Michigan played entirely different after these free throws. Did that call on its own cost them the game? No. But if you have the ball down 3, you don't have to try and force the next possession which is exactly what they did when they got it back.  Even if everything goes exactly the same way as it did afterward, you're within one possession with under a minute to go and don't have to foul.  We have no idea how any of that plays out."
"They should package him with THJ, Courtney Lee, and Trey Burke to anyone who has the cap space to absorb all of that in exchange for 2 first rounders. They will get clowned relentlessly for months before all the simpletons eventually figure out that they won the trade easily. Fuck KP."
Trey Burke being on an NBA roster is such an embarrassment for the org that signed him
Put in Trey Burke
Trey burke did have a decent series against us in the bubble
trey burke!! love that guy
"I expect high pick and rolls with LUKA/KP and more minutes with the starters for J Rich.   I could also see a lineup of: Luka, JRich, THJ/Brunson, DFS, Maxi/DP getting some pretty significant minutes if KP continues to struggle with the clippers small ball  Additional note: don‚Äôt be surprised if Trey Burke gets some minutes tonight"
"I'll give you Brunson, but Trey Burke averages 1.3 APG vs 5.7 FGA. He's more of a SG than Luka is not a PG"
They‚Äôve got Trey Burke and Jalen Brunson but they don‚Äôt start for them so Luka facilitates.
Why doesn‚Äôt Trey Burke get minutes?
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
Always liked this guy and his game. He's come a long way. I remember watchin him wit Trey Burke in Michigan   Dallas better give him whatever they need to to keep him. Would love to see him and Luka together for years and years
Mavs won the Trey Burke trade
"We still have guys that can give us good minutes that havent even been used in these two games. Trey Burke is great at defending small guards and can be a microwave scorer at any moment (great for playoff series when energy needed). We have Josh Richardson, a guy who has been starting for playoff teams, coming off the bench. Hardaway/Finney Smith/Kleber all 40% 3 point shooters. Jalen And then Brunson finished top 5 in 6moy voting. If we need to exploit a mismatch, we throw in Boban. There's just a lot of stuff we can do with out roster and we have a coach in Rick Carlisle who knows exactly when to pull one of these cards.  We lack top-end talent outside of Luka. But we have a very deep team. And when the Clippers cannot contain Luka it makes those role players job much easier. Clippers also have good depth, but similarly lack mid-level talent outside of Kawhi/PG. Batum/Ibaka/Bev/Rondo/Zubac are all great players to have on a playoff roster, but you don't want any of those guys being your third best player. Still got a shooter like Kennard, defender like Mann to bring specific traits to the floor as well. Both teams are deep, but missing a bit in starting level talent."
TREY BURKE
Trey Burke üôÉ
"I wish Trey Burke would get some minutes, only rooting for the mavs cause my boys THjr and Trey Burke are playing together! Go Blue!  Was fun to watch them last year!!"
Last year I witnessed the mavs exploiting the Trey Burke Kawhi mismatch and getting easy buckets over and over. Even this last game we were letting Brunson and Timmy outrun these bigger dudes or getting luka going downhill off a screen going right at Kawhi. He's an elite defender but Carlisle is good at putting defenders in a position to fail.
"The only nba game i saw live was a knicks-celtics at msg in 2018. Knicks were down like 10+, and Tim single handedly brought them back, couldn't miss. Hit 4 straight threes I guess. It was crazy. (They gave the last shot to Trey Burke, and lost tho üòÖ)"
"Dallas too! We've got Luka, Porzi≈Üƒ£is, THJ, Brunson and Trey Burke lmao"
Trey Burke is so underrated.
Hines Ward too I think. Lots of former QB's. Trey Burke with Florida played tight end. I'm sure there are plenty more.
"Has he? I feel like Jrich has taken a dip in production since leaving Miami   Last year trey Burke and curry were roasting our guards, especially those 3 guard line ups   The biggest addition to the clippers isn't exactly an addition but a subtraction of Glenn Lou Trez  Boban also was straight cooking trez"
"&gt; Randle was nowhere near bust status or having is NBA career in jeopardy, many Lakers fans wanted to keep him.  That is part of my point. Even he doesn't fit. Pretty much no one does.  &gt;It's an interesting point you make but players mocked that high don't constantly fail as hard as the Suns did even if it takes them going to another team.  But if it was because of the Suns failure to develop them, other teams should find tons of value swooping and picking up these young guys with star potential. Turns out they are pretty nonfactor on their teams no matter where they go and not anywhere close to being a star that many predicted before the Suns drafted them.  &gt;The Suns didn't reach but these guys failed spectacularly, there must be something the Suns were doing wrong in terms of player development that made them irredeemable.  If you got a coin and flip it 10 times it wont likely alternate heads then tails everytime. You are likely get a string of heads and/or a string of tails. It is a crapshoot. The Utah Jazz picked Kanter, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles to Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This is also true accross sports, Seahawks had a string of historically great draft classes in the early 2010's to pretty bad recently in comparison. It often takes 1 or 2 players to chance an entire narrative of draft history and if 76ers never got Embiid, if Bucks never got Giannis, and if Kings got Doncic instead of Bagley, it would change entire prespectives."
"They upgraded they‚Äôre playmaking with rondo and Ibaka should be able protect the rim but i worry about his inability to handle matchups against shifty guards(as showcased vs Boston last year where nurse was forced into playing OG at the 5) and his vulnerability in the low post vs high level offensive bigs( such as AD). The other big aren‚Äôt exactly defensive stoppers either(Cousins and Zubac)  They also finished with a worse record this season and a worse defensive rating while admittedly getting better offensively.   I agree that the mavs likely wont beat them mainly because they lost guys like seth curry and i doubt Trey burke can get to the level of play he showed in the bubble. Not necessarily because the clippers have shown themselves to be a much better team, im ready to give them props if im wrong though"
Yeah but I think having 4-5 more rotation players is beneficial. If Trey Burke hadn‚Äôt been a sniper we would‚Äôve been like 6 deep in the final 3 games. I do agree y‚Äôall have gotten better though
"Lowest contested rebound percentage, minimum 50% of games played  Patty Mills (6.0%) Tyus Jones (7.3%) Isaiah Joe (9.1%) JJ Redick &amp; Trey Burke (9.4%) **Carmelo Anthony is at 27.8%**  Melo is the GOAT."
bro the only help he had was Trey Burke and still averaged that
"Trey Burke, Brandon Goodwin"
Trey Burke
"We‚Äôve now reached the playoffs twice with KP and Tim, we got a decent piece in Trey Burke and possibly have a 5 seed in the West, i have no idea how this could even slightly be considered a lost trade for the Mavericks"
"we got THJ and KP and Trey Burke for 2 late firsts and a DSJ, don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a win"
"Yeah it seems like there is a unity in not disclosing vaccination status as to not ""out"" or scrutinize your unvaxxed teammates. It's frustrating but not surprising in a field that is so rooted in trust and teamwork.  This is why players like Bogdan, CJ or Kareem who have called out anti-vaxxers and been pro-vaccine have been great. Who tf cares about hurting anti-vaxxers feelings. Make them feel shitty and like morons because thats what they are. None of these guys saying ""they want to do their own research"" are doing anything other than googling and finding the first source that confirms their bias. They aren't reeding peer reviewed articles, they aren't conversing with Virologists or Scientists. As a researcher who has worked alongside the TRACE-Covid-19 project it's infuriating to see folks like Trey Burke or Andrew Wiggins say they need to do research and proceed to share anti-vaccine click bait from social media and ignore tested science results."
Trey Burke is unvaccinated so maybe he dosent want to endorse the vaccines so he dosent feel pressed about it? idk
"He's been an anti-vaxxer since before COVID. He's not going to ""do more research""; he's never getting the vaccine unless the government forces him to (which I would argue it should). This is all rehearsed and pre-planned by a really stupid person that thinks he's a really smart person. Fuck Trey Burke."
Not to mention Trey Burke isn't a max level player for anyone to put up with that antivax nonsense.
"Damn, Trey Burke better save up now while he still has money then."
"That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm shocked that Trey Burke hasn‚Äôt gotten it. He‚Äôs behind Luka and Jalen in terms of point guard playing time and is presumably our 12th man. Why are expendable 12th men fucking around with this?  On a funnier note, I‚Äôm imagining Isaiah Thomas getting every shot available and releasing covid in benchwarmer‚Äôs lockers and then be like ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôd like to work me out, what a surprise Grizzlies!‚Äù"
One outlier to that is Trey Burke on the Mavs. Guy is about to be cut from the team and he is sticking to his anti-vax stance instead. Probably the only player left on the team keeping us from 100%
Josh Richardson and Trey Burke off the bench
I know Trey Burke isn‚Äôt vaccinated.
When Trey Burke randomly went nuclear in the bubble I saw a couple really bad ones.
"Brandon Knight, Jabari Parker, Kawhi Leonard (I got one right), Trey Burke, Patrick Young (played college ball in Florida), Thomas Robinson... The list could go on."
