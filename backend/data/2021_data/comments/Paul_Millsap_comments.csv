"Offense: G Jamal Murray, G Monte Morris, F Will Barton, F MPJ, C Nikola Jokic  Defense: G PJ Dozier, G Shaq Harrison, F Aaron Gordon, F Paul Millsap, C Javale???"
"When he was assitant coach with the Hawks he had a knack for developing a more consistent three pointer for our wings and our bigs. Paul Millsap, Al Horford, and Demarre Carrol all developed a consistent 3pt shot in Atlanta under Atkinson's watch. The previous years those three players all shot less than one a game.  I'd also contend that guys like Millsap, Teague, Horford, Carrol, and even Hardaway had some of their best defensive years in Atlanta which can be attributed to both Bud and Atkinson."
"In addition to making the playoffs and 50+ wins out West, Dirk made ASGs int he West going up against a ton of great bigs/forwards. Competition was so good that Dirk missed All Star Games while averaging: 22/9/2 ('01), 17/7/3 ('13), 18/7/2 ('16)  Aside from the first season, none of those seasons pop out as all time great seasons, but they were still solid numbers, in the West he didn't come close to the ASG, but in the East I'm sure he makes the ASG 2 or maybe even all 3 times with those numbers. Dirk was making all star games and all NBA teams while going up against prime Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.   For reference the years he missed the ASG while putting up those numbers, Eastern conference bigs who got in were averaging:   * 2001: Dirk averaged 22/9/2    * Anthony Mason averaged 16/10/3    * Glenn Robinson averaged 22/7/3    * Lattrell Sprewell averaged 18/5/4    * Allan Houston averaged 19/4/2    * Antonio Davis averaged 14/10/1 * 2013: Dirk averaged 17/7/3    * Luol Deng averaged 17/6/3    * Brook Lopez averaged 19/7/2    * Kevin Garnett averaged 15/8/2    * Chris Bosh averaged 17/7/2 * 2016: Dirk averaged 18/7/2    * Paul Millsap averaged 17/9/3    * Al Horford averaged 15/7/3    * Pau Gasol averaged 17/11/4    * Andre Drummond averaged 15/14/1"
6 minutes. And in those 6  minutes we were outscored by 15. We lost by 5.   Hmm...  The obvious alternative was **to stop playing nurkic in non jokic minutes**. That's fucking insane coach. There's no defending that. You have a dude that we rely on for all of our defense who is foul prone and you're subbing him out while Jokic is on the floor then playing him when Jokic is sitting. How can you defend that as good game planning?  Against their bench you can play small. They didn't play a center. They played Paul Millsap  It was obvious after 1 game it wouldn't work because jokic is better now. But stotts couldn't see that. It took that flagrant even after being outscored by 15 in 5 minutes
"Basically many of the guys who would be in the “hall of very good”. Guys who were great on the court but not enough to be a HOF, like Paul millsap, Joe Johnson (Hopefully not cuz who doesn’t like ISO Joe), Corey Maguette, Tayshaun Prince, etc"
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"Current Isaiah Thomas before injury, Pistons Isaiah Thomas, Gilbert arenas, Marc Gasol, Malcom Brogdon, Paul Millsap, Mark Price, Mo Cheeks, Draymond even though he sucks at scoring"
"Evans definitely wasn't a tweener, he was typical wing size with a wing/guard skillset.   A tweener someone with a traditional PF skillset but undersized. E.g. Paul Millsap, Dray, or Anthony Bennet."
"lol well if your position is trade CJ for Butler then sure, you've solved your problem. But you're not getting Butler. CJ's efficiency isn't astronomical because he's bad at getting to the line, agree with you there. If he could average 6 FTs a game he'd be a true star but he's not explosive or big enough. But his offensive impact is very very good. Look at any on/off, +/-, WAR, etc. stat you want. He's up there with elite guys.  If you think you're replacing that with Norm or someone of his caliber bc you had a stretch where Lillard had to kill himself to keep the team afloat without CJ, good luck. The benefit of CJ is he can give Lillard a break. Get rid of CJ and you'll have no secondary ballhandler or scoring option. Dame's not scoring 40 a night all season. He can do that in stretches to cover for guys, but it's not going to work long-term.  And this is the problem with CJ trades: you can keep braying on about how he's not good enough and should go, but what are you getting back? Replacing him with cheap parts, which is really the only option most people see, isn't going to help the team. You're looking at Harrison Barnes, Josh Richardon/Maxi Kleber type deals. Maybe Jerami Grant, probably not. Good luck with Ben Simmons lol.  And part of ""showing up"" is being productive in the regular season. It's hilarious that people reduce players to playoff losses. How do you think teams get to the playoffs? CJ's been a huge part of keeping the Blazers highly competitive year in and year out with very few quality players around him and Dame.  CJ isn't a good defender, but he's not the reason the entire team stinks on that end. What the Blazers need is to not play the worst defenseive bench imaginable: Simons, Melo and Kanter. That's what sunk the team in the playoffs. They were beyond awful. Totally unplayable. Abused by other starters and backups. Flipping at least two of those guys out for quality rotation pieces who can offer even marginal defensive resistance improves the Blazers significantly. You can't have Paul Millsap destroying you in the playoffs at like 37. That's where I'd start this offseason."
"It's been a while but from a [random BR report article at the time](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/199977-top-30-nba-free-agents-and-where-they-will-sign-in-2009), the top 10 free agents that summer were:  1. Carlos Boozer  2. Ben Gordon  3. Lamar Odom  4. Ron Artest  5. Rasheed Wallace  6. Hedo Turkoglu  7. Jason Kidd  8. Shawn Marion  9. Paul Millsap  10. Allen Iverson  17. Charlie Villanueva  If I recall, there were some pipe dreams, as you alluded, to some restricted free agents coming out or dudes opting out (like LeBron or Kobe or whoever else) but none of that came to fruition.   Considering that rundown, snagging a young Ben Gordon who seemed to be ascending didn't seem like too shabby of a pick-up. And while Charlie V was never great, I admit I figured he wouldn't be out there catching DNP's every night two years into his deal.   It seemed like Joe Dumars was trying to ease into a smooth next-gen transition and there was a failure to launch."
Here’s a list of the top 5 playoff games without a finals appearance: https://www.instagram.com/p/CQzSJkMrQkZ/?utm_medium=copy_link  Paul Millsap - 129 Al Horford - 124 Chris Paul - 123 (until Game 1) Joe Johnson - 120 Steve Nash - 120
Paul Millsap
1 Jeff Green  2  Kawhi  3 Dirk? 4. Paul Millsap 5 Super TT 6 Jimmy Butler with a jumper  7 Harden.    Looking at upside.
SMH the Paul Millsap disrespect. The man was legitimate the best player on a 1 seed was probably more important than Horford.
Most #4 picks are not even close to as good as Paul Millsap was. If Jaren becomes approximately the 30th-35th best player in the NBA that's a good outcome. I think you're just underrating Paul Millsap.
I'm big on Patrick Williams. I could see him turning into a better shooting Derrick Favors-type even if he doesn't become an all-star. Or maybe late career Paul Millsap. Depends which way his offensive and defensive games go.
"Oh, definitely. Even around the league they weren't generating as much excitement as their record should. No one wants to watch a team led by Al Horford, Kyle Korver and Paul Millsap lol."
"Kinda makes me wonder how an All-Old team would look. Only taking folks from the oldest 20 players in the league, I’ve got:   PG: Chris Paul, Goran Dragic  SG: JJ Redick, Andre Iguadola   SF: LeBron James, Trevor Ariza   PF: Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap  C: Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol  Honestly, that’s not a bad team. I’d call it a second round exit, maybe conference finals."
I don't know if it's love but I don't think you'll find a single Hawks fan who doesn't like Paul Millsap
Fans are some of the most emotional people. Two years ago every bucks player was nuttin for bud on the team. Remember when Bud took the Hawks far in the playoffs and got coach of the year? A team centered around Paul millsap and al horford….Great players but not superstars. Bud is a good coach. Bucks are in the ECF. Just cus he got out coached in a series doesn’t make him a bad coach. The team won anyways.
"Lol yes, the team of misfits and ""almost stars"" that dragged a hopeless franchise to 60 wins. Those guys played their hearts out, from Jeff Teague to Paul Millsap and you're disrespectful and ungrateful. I guess ATL being full of clowns like you is why the stadium was always empty."
"Paul Millsap is a good one, so is John Wall. Dlo, Vucevic, Luka, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, KAT unless he really turns his career around, Iggy shouldn't make it IMO but he might."
"How is a guy going to gain experience when he is not given the chance. Also, then you might as well call up Paul Millsap or Covington. If you just want guys who have rings for your PF spot then they should just say that. Millsap and Cov both played reasonable amount of time this season and have extensive playoff experience."
Paul George? He doesn’t even shoot better than Paul Millsap my guy..
"The Hawks can still win this. They need to do a whole lineup change; bring in DeMarre Carroll, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Al Horford.   I have no idea why they haven’t been playing this game. Maybe it’s time for them to move on from Budenholzer, he’s garbage."
Paul millsap is the only answer
"Kyle Lowry, Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, Steve Nash, Dennis Rodman hit his prime when he was like 50, Sam Cassell, Stockton, I'm sure there's more that's just off the top of my head. Ben is arguably better than all of those dudes were at this point in their careers. He still has upside."
How are we overlooking that OP thinks Paul George and Millsap are better than Paul Pierce?
"Haha it totally be that way.   Would people really think much of the 2015 Warriors championship if they beat Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and the gosh darn Atlanta Hawks instead of an injured Cleveland Cavs? Probably not.  Much as I love this Final Four — The story I had in my head was Suns vs Nets as the new David vs Goliath. It was surprising when Snoke died, but it also was like, 'okay where does this story go now?'"
We opted to sign Paul Millsap instead that off-season. That ended up pretty good for us lol
THE DISRESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL PLAYOFF P   (/s but I really do like paul millsap)
"What's more interesting is how little of what that 2014- 2015 team became assets for them:  * The following left in free agency for nothing: Al Horford, Paul Millsap, DeMarre Carroll, Thabo Sefolosha, Pero Antic, John Jenkins, Elton Brand, Austin Daye (waived in his final season) * Adreian Payne traded that season (his rookie year) to the Twolves for the pick that became K'Von ""Red Velvet"" Huerter  * Following were traded for things that didn't matter: Mike Scott  (a 2nd that did not convey), Shelvin Mack (traded for washed up Kirk Hinrich in his final season), Korver (traded for a retired Mo Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr. in his final season and a 1st that did not convey). * Schroder was traded for a pick that conveys next year plus a whole bunch of nothing. *  Jeff Teague traded for Taurean Prince and a pick that was packaged with other picks to get DeAndre Hunter. * Kent Bazemore and a future first eventually became Clint Capela.   So in summary, from that roster they only really got Clint Capela, Huerter, and DeAndre Hunter. 4/5 of the ""NBA Player of the Month"" team left for nothing. I remember there was a lot of criticism of the Hawks for not getting assets for their players, but it didn't really matter. Schlenk did a good job of rebuilding through the draft and free agency."
You can say the same thing for Paul Millsap.
PAUL MILLSAP???
Disrespect to how good Paul Millsap was that season.  Hyper efficient
"Paul Millsap, AL Horford, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver"
He won 60 games with Paul Millsap as his best player lol
"No they were not.  The hawks were led by Paul millsap dropping 16 a game. Donovan mitchell dropped 26 this year. How the hell is that a ""No superstar"" team."
I'd personally say Giannis. We were a good defensive team in 2018 with just Paul Millsap. Role playing defensive players are easier to find than shot creators.   The problem right now is mpj is even worse on defence and that's why we can't do shit vs the pnr. Then add in the fact that we missed our best guard defender
"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"Mike Conley. People forget this man was part of the Grizzlies roster alongside Marc Gasol that made the WCF. Plus he had to play against Steph, Dame, Russ, Harden (when he played PG), pre-Lakers Steve Nash, Chris Paul, and many more. Never had a shot of making the All-Star team, until this year. I would say his name and Donovan Mitchell's name (but I had to do only 1 Jazz player) at the top even if I wasn't a Jazz fan.  Honorable mentions: Dame, Giannis, Al Horford, and Paul Millsap."
"Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, DeMar Derozen."
Paul millsap got his first win against lebron last year in the nuggets he was a hawk for most of his career
"If they get Derrick Rose, Al Horford,  and Paul Millsap they can have a big 8"
"This is the type of player that is an immediate difference in the playoffs for the next 2 years. A Paul Millsap or Marc Gasoline type that you can trust in the clutch. They are role players that can be one of the most important players.  He is worth it for about 5 franchises right now and that's it. If he was 26, it would be everyone."
"Possible dumb question about the Jokic-Gobert clip.  Why is Gobert lingering awkwardly in the paint while 6'4 Royce O'Neal guards Jokic ~10 feet from the basket?  Seems like the natural first move would be to go pressure Jokic directly as soon as he gets the ball, and let O'Neal either double team him or go do something else.  Gobert seems to be distracted by Paul Millsap, but it seems weird to focus on the 10ppg scorer out past the FT line instead of the 27ppg scorer two steps from the hoop.  I'm pretty sure the 2 time DPOY is standing there for a reason, but it looks weird on tape."
Anthony Edwards  Paul Millsap  Zion Williamson  Eric Paschall  Big Breast Ball
Paul Millsap is Thor in this spot
"Popularity has literally nothing to do with allstar appearances when it comes to the bench. If popularity was taken into account by the coaches, then guys like Al Horford and Paul Millsap would not be multiple time allstars."
"No they can't lmao.  MPJ is the only valuable asset that the Nuggets have. Obviously he goes in any Beal trade, but the rest of the salary match is mediocre. Gary Harris? Will Barton? Paul Millsap? What does Washington need with those guys? And there's no way in hell Denver would give Jamal Murray for what could be a Beal rental.  Because of salary match GSW would offer Wiseman, Looney, Oubre and their first. It's a decent offer, but Oubre would be a rental. It's essentially two high firsts for Beal.  Atlanta has the most assets that can be offered and the 76ers have the best player available in Simmons. Tell me how Denver and GSW outbids them?  Go away nephew."
"I know he’s talking about having 4 players on the same team going to the ASG together but he’s really selling Jazz team short if he’s comparing them to Paul Millsap-led Hawks.   Also, Millsap being a 4x All-Star is wildly hilarious. I don’t think he was ever even a Top 20 player in any stretch of his career. 4 All-Star games is as many as HOFers Milan, Spencer Haywood, Connie Hawkins, Earl Monroe, to name a few. 4 is more than guys from his era like Arenas(3), Marc Gasol(3), Derrick Rose(3), Deron Williams(3) and even Draymond (3), if Draymond never makes another ASG. Millsap was never better than any of these guys."
Dude paul millsap was fucking nice though. He was easily a top 20 player that year.
"The best player was Paul millsap. That’s why. None of them were stars before the hawks, and they all fell off after leaving. It was nowhere close to a super team, it was just a really good team with a coach at his peak"
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
"I say all the time that some of those D Will Jazz teams were ten years too early.  D Will, Boozer, AK-47, Memo with Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver off the bench with a modern approach to the game?"
I see your offer and raise you one ghost of Paul Millsap for Larry Nance jr straight up
Okay but in a playoff series Steph might literally see box and ones again. The Nuggets for all their flaws still have Murray who can score at a high level and MPJ who has his moments plus a savvy vet Paul Millsap and some solid role players. Obviously this is just on top of having an offensive genius in Jokic who can be fine defensively. I’d be more scared of Denver than GS.
Bruh the Paul Millsap/Big Al frontcourt in the early '10s for the Jazz may be the thiccccest of all time.
"You have to look beyond the record. Jokic has been utterly dominant, just as much as Embiid has been while also literally running the offense and setting up his teammates - dude leads the league in assists, as a center. He's 4th in the NBA in steals. Leads the league in PER, and is at or near the top in BPM, DRPM, TPA, etc. He's scored or assisted on 42% of the Nuggets made baskets this year, which is the highest percent in the NBA (next closest is Luka at 40%, and PG and Embiid are closer to like 25% each respectively since people are mentioning them). And honestly he's doing this with teammates that mostly have been subpar so far.  What I mean partly - the Nuggets have been incomplete the whole year. Murray hurt his elbow in the 3rd game and hasnt really be right since, missed one game but he's still bothered by it. JaMychal Green missed the first four games, and MPJ missed the last 10, so the Nuggets depth/size at forward has been quite bad mostly. Monte Morris has been steady as always, PJ Dozier is ok, defends well, JaMychal Green has been solid as a backup 4... but Gary Harris is still one of the worst shooters in the NBA, and Will Barton has been wildly up and down (and REALLY cant finish at the rim). Paul Millsap is incapable of finishing in the paint anymore, for the most part. Like, Jokic's teammates have really not been very good, and he still is just dominant (to add a bit more evidence, only 3 Nuggets have a positive net rating when playing without Jokic - Murray, Monte Morris, and PJ Dozier). It's not a stretch to say that Jokic is quite literally the only thing separating the Nuggets from being average right now in record (with the 5th best net rating in the NBA mind you), and being utterly awful, like worst team in the NBA. With him on the floor the Nuggets offensive rating is 120. With him off, it's 97 which is historically bad (and also the largest difference in offensive on-off rating in the NBA by a HUGE margin). If all that doesn't make someone an MVP candidate I dunno what does."
"&gt; Do you have any examples of other players like that that just continued to improved in their late 20's ? I had Lowry but honestly Lowry was already really good on Houston.  Steve Nash is the best example. When he was 30 I don't think anyone considered him an all-time great. He was a 2x All-Star and 2x All-NBA Third Team after 8 seasons in the league.  After the age of 30:   * 2x MVP * 6x All-Star * 5x All-NBA (3x First Team, 2x Second Team) * 5x assists leader * 4x 50-40-90  As you mentioned, Kyle Lowry is another example. Yeah he was pretty good pre-Toronto, but in Toronto he took a massive leap. Same case with Paul Millsap - he was pretty good in Utah, then signed with Atlanta and became a star."
Tough call between Paul Millsap &amp; DeAaron Fox for current Louisianan
I would put Karl Malone over Paul Millsap in Louisiana.  I would also put Pete Maravich over Kyle Lowry in Pennsylvania.  Those names come to mind off the top of my head but I know ranking players all time isn't easy.
"Fair enough. I’ll just say, if Paul Millsap is still a starter at 35 after how he looked in the playoffs I don’t see why Draymond still won’t be effective for another few years."

"Something I was thinking about was how everyone says the league is downsizing, but it's not centers who are dying out, regardless of what Shaq might say. It's the traditional power forward. If you're big enough, you just slide over to center (Derrick Favors), or play both positions (Anthony Davis). If you're not big enough to play center, then you need to expand your game, most notably with a three-point shot, which Blake, Paul Millsap, and Kevin Love have done in recent years.  Griffin had the ball-handling and passing skills, but he's needed to add the 3 to make up for the changing league, and his body deteriorating.   There aren't a lot of Horace Grant, Brian Grant, Charles Oakley type PFs in today's league. Most PFs are big wings, and/or have a more perimeter-oriented skill set."
Aggressive Paul Millsap
Prime Paul Millsap maybe?
Paul Millsap is terrible at telling stories lol
wouldn’t strength be something Paul Millsap and LeBron are comparable at? why wouldn’t you say passing or sum else
"Did Jordan ever get to play teams that were led by Lowry, tobias harris, or paul millsap to get to the finals?"
I remember reading an interview where Paul Millsap was quoted basically saying that he told Jokic that he has to be the guy taking shots in big moments/end of game scenario. Basically telling Jokic that the whole team was better off when Jokic took those shots. So cool to see it all coming together. He’s honestly my favorite player rn
"Basketball reference has a cool [HoF Prob](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) stat that tracks their understanding of the player's chances to be in the HoF based on accolades, stats, and a few random other factors (for some reason, height?) that I've dug into pretty deep. I can get into it a little if you're interested, but it's a little overly conservative and can't really take coaching experience or cultural impact into account, so it really breaks for some obvious ones (Don Nelson and Drazen Petrovic both show as no chance essentially)  Anyhow, they have Rose at a 12% chance, just behind Al Horford and just ahead of Bernard King (who is in the Hall). Cousins is all the way down at a 1.5% chance, just behind Larry Siegfried and ahead of Scott Wedman. Per this specific measurement, Drummond actually already has a better chance at the HoF than Boogie - as do DeAndre Jordan, Paul Millsap, IT, etc.  For what it may be worth, per this stat, best player not to make the HOF yet despite eligibility is Bosh, who has a 99.51% chance, but was only eligible one year. Second place is Larry Foust, a star C from the 50s, with a 94.2% chance, an third is Chauncey Billups, with an 84.4% chance."
"Lol it’s the top of the draft. LaMelo has a great feel for the game, but I think Wiseman’s floor is Paul Millsap with Faried’s athleticism. 10 and 6 in 20 minutes as a 19 year old while not really being incorporated in the offense is not bad, in fact it’s good. Both have the chance at very long, successful careers."
"Paul Millsap, Brandon Ingram, and Drew Eubanks"
"finney-smith can guard 1-5  among his most frequent matchups:  murray, chris paul, lavine, harden, millsap, lebron, gasol, olynyk"
"What do Denver fans think of a trade for Drummond where they send us paul millsap and a 1st? I've heard complaints about their backup center, and Drummond could be decent as a backup while also being an expiring contract."
Yeah I mean KG and Pierce were not even close to like last year on the Hawks Al Horford/Paul Millsap when they were traded to the Nets. I’d be shocked if either any of those picks end up a good a player as Harden or that Harden will be even remotely close to as bad as Pierce and KG were at the time. Hell even 50% of current Harden is more valuable than Pierce and KG were at the time lol.
"I'm like, is this something literally anyone is. infused about? all they have is Gary Harris and Paul Millsap and SORT OF Barton. everyone else is a negative defender for their position or atrocious. clearly defense is their problem. they're out here looking like the old Kiki nuggets back in the day"
Paul Millsap maybe?

"Agreed. Murray has looked like a ghost out there so far. He needs something. Idk if it's rest, smelling salts, a hug from Paul Millsap... Something though"
"I've been saying since last year that the Nuggets need to shake it up to really contend, and we're all seeing their deep seated issues so far this season. I think Washington needs a shake up too, they have good players but they just don't fit together well. I came up with this trade, which works on the trade machine:  Denver gets:   * Davis Bertans  * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * Jamal Murray  * Paul Millsap  * Bol Bol  * RJ Hampton  * 3 1sts (2021, 2024, 2026)  * 2 pick swaps (2022, 2025)  Denver runs Beal/Harris/MPJ/Bertans/Jokic, great spacing for Jokic to work with, and Beal adds consistent star power, which Denver needs to pair with Jokic, he's not enough by himself. Second unit of Morris/Campazzo/Barton/Green/Hartenstein  The Wiz get a very promising young PG in Murray, two talented projects in Bol and Hampton, Millsap is expiring financial filler who provides a veteran presence for a year, and several picks/swaps to help the rebuild."
"He's still getting paid 20m  Nuggets would look something like this - Murray (30m) + Jokic (30m) + Gary Harris  (20m) + Grant (20m) + Barton (15m) + Monte Morris (10m)   You don't have any money to sign JaMychal Green and I'm no salary cap expert I think you have to let Paul Millsap go if you want to talk about the future with MPJ and potentially the possibility of an extension the next year, Gary Harris by then would become a FA though, so you can choose to resign or let him leave in FA because you probably can't pay him as much as he would like.  From in the 2020 season advanced stats show the Nuggets offense and defense was better when he was off the court, but idk - check in 2 months time to see if he's still ballin."
Paul Millsap just seems like a good man and I wish him the best.
"Individual defense for guards doesn't have much impact on the game. Gobert could average 8 points a game and still have an all-star impact. Patrick Beverley, on the other hand, will never be that impactful.  &gt; everyone values offense over defense  Look at how Paul Millsap got paid. OG Anunoby. Robert Covington. Jonathan Isaac. Thaddeus Young.  Don't compare a shooting PF to a defending PG."
"PF-Centers that come to mind, whether starting at one and transitioning to the other at different stages of career/roster/or even mid-game: Channing Frye, Al Horford, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Domantas Sabonis,  LaMarcus Aldridge, even Giannis plays a fair bit at 4/5...Porzingis as well has that flexibility.   Are PFs really getting smaller/faster/more skilled more so than any other position, or is that just happening more pronouncedly at the 4/5, where there was the most room for improvement? It'd probably be fairer to say there has just been an overall blurring of the lines between roles rather than focusing on just the meta changes at the PF"
"Yea, if you start a team with KAT, you need a defensive anchor at PF. Someone like a younger Paul Millsap, healthy Jonathan Isaac, Bam, Giannis, or AD."
Have to walk the tightrope between tanking and having enough competent vets around to help rookies develop.  I wonder a lot what would have happened if we had grabbed a couple picks in salary dumps instead of using 30 million in cap to sign Paul Millsap on a 3-1 (and Plumlee too I guess lol). I feel like Paul really did (and still does) so much to help Jokic and Murray grow into professionals who deserve their max contracts.  And besides even if the Grant contract doesn't have Covington trade value it probably still has positive value to a contender.
Free Cheeseburgers!  -Paul Millsap 2021
&gt;Paul Millsap on what it’s like playing next to Nikola Jokic: “It’s cheeseburgers. He’s throwing free cheeseburgers. I don’t eat cheeseburgers ... but if they’re free...”
Paul Millsap is going to trick a team into giving him a nice contract next season. Dude is exclusively getting wide open layups and 3s.
1 or 2 seed in the east. Hawks got to 60 wins with Paul millsap being the top scorer with 16.7 ppg. They had 6 players 10 or more ppg.
"So explain it. Why does NFL media not desperately thirst for guys like Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes to dip from their shit market teams ASAP while most NBA media types were down to drive Giannis or AD to the airport themselves if it meant getting them to LA or NY? The league would kill for a half decent QB on the Jets or Bears or Chargers.  What is it about how the NFL is “run” that Peyton Manning can take his talents to Denver (after a career in Indianapolis no less) and nobody bats an eye but the idea of LeBron doing the same was too absurd to consider and the best the Nuggets have ever managed was a washed up Paul Millsap?  Yeah NFL is about teams and NBA is about players, but both of those things are entirely intentional marketing decisions. There’s no actual reason the NBA couldn’t market teams first and players second, every other basketball league manages just fine."
"Utah jazz and PF.   Karl Malone, Carlos Boozer, then Paul Millsap last few years they haven't had anything crazy special at pf but growing up it seemed pf was there thing."
We don't know considering KAT and D'lo have literally only played **3 games together**.  The team looked competent with the two of them together on the floor and contention is largely based on Culver and Anthony Edwards progressing and being the supporting pieces to the 2 stars on the team. The other and more likely option that Rosas has been aggressively exploring is a trade for a third star so expect that maybe near the trade deadline.  But your claim that our culture is fucked is so wrong because since Rosas has came here he's been developing a family type culture and players have commented on it (He made a collage of all the articles about Malik Beasley and his play with the Timberwolves to convince him to sign the contract quickly or how he made a whole presentation for J.J Reddick) and even Paul Millsap considered a move to the Timberwolves but was reluctant to pull out his kids from their schools in Denver and re-signed with the Nuggets once they whiffed on Grant.
This is what you like seeing from him: recognizing he has a mismatch on the perimeter vs 35 y/o Paul Millsap. The main concern about Edwards pretty much is his IQ as he has all the scoring talent. That’s a high IQ play
The Nuggets desperately need defense and swapping Gary Harris and Paul Millsap for PG and RoCo in the starting line would be very nice.
"Yeah. Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, and Jeff Teague. Catch the fever lol"
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
"&gt;a first ballot Hall of Fame player off the bench  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;and started 4 other Hall of Famers, 3 of which went first ballot?  Campazzo, Porter, Rivers, Gordon"
Paul millsap has the best job in the world
"LeBron’s back was fucked in that series/whole 2014-2015 season, I thought bro time was about to end like Larry Bird’s. Plus Iggy was fouling the hell out of him lmaooo. I think if LeBron was healthy, that could’ve been a game 7 series. But in retrospect I truly think the Cavs shouldn’t have traded for Kevin Love &amp; actually went for Al Horford. Kevin Love isn’t a 16 game player due to his low motor, durability &amp; defensive limitations. They possibly could’ve got Paul Millsap in that trade too due to major hype Wiggins had in that upcoming draft &amp; got off of Anderson Varejao contract."
I mean if you thought there was a plan for the Jeff Teague Paul millsap hawks to beat LeBron idek
"Jefferson is more of a pf, stretch 4. Reminds me that dude from Atlanta Paul Millsap, he'll get you like 8 or 9 boards. Ideally come off the bench for Blake"
So did the hawks lead by Paul Millsap. East winners from 2008 to 2018 weren't special outside of heat big 3 and Boston big 3.
A team that has a two time mvp on it isn’t comparable to one who’s best player is Kyle Lowry or Paul millsap. Is that hard to understand ?
"Are you kidding me? The eastern conference from 2008 to 2018 was literally one of the weakest conferences of all time if you exclude Lebron... The only notable team was the Big 3 Celtics who got injured and was aging terribly by the time Lebron joined the Heat. There was a Hawks team that got #1 seed lead by Paul Millsap ffs. That shows just how strong that conference was.   The 80's had mountains more competition specifically in the eastern conference against Bird. Now if you want to argue the West had weak competition outside of obviously the Lakers and at times Houston, Spurs and Nuggets in the 80s sure but the East in the 80's was fucking stacked. Lebron had to deal with Dwight Howard once and it gave his team problems. Imagine 5 other teams with Dwight Howard and Boston Big 3 like competition or better, leaving you with less chances to dodge that competition in the playoffs.   &gt; LeBron was also doing it in a far more competitive and complete league Bird had no argument at the time.  GTFO here."
When did lebron play a two time mvp in his prime ? The best player lebron beat in those playoffs was Paul millsap Rasheed Wallace and Kyle Lowry.
The best overall scorer on that hawks team was Paul Millsap. The best perimeter scorer was Jeff Teague. They weren't good dude
"Sorry Paul, gotta make one cut for mostly my feels. As good as Millsap was for us, Joe’s legend here in Utah will always be bigger than his"
The real difference maker in this game is the lack of Paul Millsap which is helping the Nuggets
Paul Millsap   0 All-Star selections in 7 seasons with the Jazz   4 All-Star selections in 4 seasons with the Hawks   0 All-Star selections in 4 seasons with the Nuggets
"It doesn't really matter, if he plays the 4 teams would just screen with his man, which would be basically be the same as if he was the 5.   You could probably get away with it in the regular season, but in the playoffs versatility is so important.  The perfect fit was Paul Millsap...if he was in his prime, a 4 that can basically be used as the back line defender when Jokic traps the Pick and roll, but most of the time that kind of player takes away spacing on offense"
"I know I'm going to get crushed for this but whatever.  Chris Paul is so overrated right now. Yes he's a great player but he's not even the best floor raiser in this series. This version of the Nuggets is garbage, like 5 worst team talent wise without Jokic. They are starting a guy they picked up off waviers a month ago and a 5'9 30 year old rookie. Their bench is a washed Millsap and Green. This Jokic season is better than any season Paul ever had  Paul has never made it past the second round as the teams best player.  Furthermore Paul is probably the dirtiest, cheapest, and annoying player in the league. There was all this complaining about trae's BS foul baiting play but Paul has been doing that for a decade and he never gets crap about it.   Paul has deserved all his playoff failures and when the Jazz crush them next series all will be right in the world"
"The Blazers gave Paul Millsap a big offer sheet and then when the Jazz matched they couldn't afford to keep Wesley Matthews, so we signed him instead."
"Millsap is too slow and old now. Bench him and give his minutes to Green. Start Monte, bench Facu, Shaq Harrison gets all backup minutes.  Have AG or Shaq guard Chris Paul at all times.  Have Barton replace Rivers as a starter."
"I can rant all day about Paul Millsap. Super underappreciated career. Utah Jazz traded for Derrick Favors and drafted Enes Kanter to replace Al Jefferson and him because they had more potential but Paul ended up being the better player. Also, a very interesting old article that was named after Millsap [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080122202848/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/) that argues that per 36 stats are actually very accurate and if anything, underestimate how much a bench player would produce if they played more minutes (with enough sample size of course)."
Austin Rivers and Paul Millsap the only Nuggets who want to get this series to 5 games
"please, no slander about the ghost of paul millsap"
"Well.. if you remember the 2013-14 season was the first season that Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap left the team and Favors and Kanter were the future superstar frontcourt that would develop over time.  Start of the 2014-15 season, Kanter was still the starter with ""star potential"", but Gobert had an awesome FIBA world cup with France.  By early mid season the Jazz knew they had a stud in Gobert and Kanter was eating center minutes. It was only obvious at that point."
....Paul hunts Millsap too.
"Paul Millsap made more threes (3) in [this sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCiHOpNJXnc) than his career total at the time (2). Seriously, this was more ridiculous than 13 in 35."
And who are we playing then 36 year old Paul Millsap
Paul Millsap is a cool dude I'm glad he's still getting paid
I'd like to request Paul Millsap to stop shooting like a god.
Who had Paul Millsap making the most 3's for Denver
Paul Millsap shot is so wet wtf
I was refering to Paul Millsap...
Paul Millsap has never had a bad game in his life.
When’s the last time Paul Millsap made a 3
IT Paul Millsap and Melo were all stars the last time Hayward was an all star. I’m talking his production the last two seasons or so
Never seen a Jazz team with this much heart and fight. It's like every player is Jazz Paul Millsap
Imagine talking shit to Paul Millsap
Paul millsap exists
no one mentioned that both of these plays are due to the boneheadedness of Paul Millsap lol.
"I mean it’s him, Paul Millsap, or PJ Tucker so I don’t think many people with disagree there"
Hows Paul millsap these days? How is he aging? Is his mobility still good?
paul millsap 15th year in the nba makes me feel VERY OLD lmao  love you paul
The last time any team left won a championship was 1983 and Paul Millsap is the oldest player in the playoffs and was born in 1985.
oldest guy on a playoff roster seems to be paul millsap who is feb of 1985
Yeah I know! Just funny to think Bud would play Giannis as much as he played Paul Millsap.
Led by Paul Millsap that team won 60 games.  But that gose against the worst coach in the league story line
"Apologies for the confusion, I meant active in the playoffs, so if Dallas loses I think Paul Millsap would be the oldest (1985)"
"&gt;Nah, this is recency bias. Jokic has been much more consistent and just as dominant.  You replied this under someone who said Kawhi is the best playoff performer so far.  &gt;Lastly, I never said Jokic is better than Kawhi but I guess I can’t expect someone that argues with emotions to see things without rose tinted glasses 🥴  ? So you said Kawhi isn't the best player in the playoffs but Jokic isn't better than Kawhi? Was the word you're looking for ""tied""? Clearly you're contradicting yourself there.  &gt;1) Jokic has a higher defensive rating than Kawhi this season (albeit, marginally). 2) Ignoring his final season with the SAS, which he barely played and was injured, Kawhi recorded his lowest Defensive Win Shares since his rookie season.  I just showed you stats that showed Kawhi has a lower defensive rtg than Jokic in the post season. Yet you said its higher (point 1). I have the proof (which I assumed you saw), so that's why I assumed you're talking about the regular season. If not, that's means you're using false statements.   &gt;Here’s some more facts since you don’t got any: Kawhi has the 3rd lowest defensive rating among all Clippers, only ahead of Pat Bev (whose been benched since game 2) and Marcus Morris.'  This is called taking stats too literally. Here's what I mean; using your argument, Jokic's offensive rtg is the 5th best on his own team, he's behind J Green, Marcus Howard, Monte Morris and Paul Millsap. Jokic's defensive rtg is 2nd worst on his own team, only Austin Rivers is worse than him.   These are facts but you want to know why I don't use them? Because that's taking them too literally. The more deeper in the stats you go, the more you have to consider the external factors. Stat analysis isn't your forte, because your same argument would mean Jokic isn't as important as Monte Morris. We all know Jokic is the best offensive player on his own team and likewise, Kawhi is the best offensive and defensive player on his own team.  &gt;Here’s some more facts since you don’t got any  [Nuggets Proof](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;TeamID=1610612743)  [Clippers Proof](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;TeamID=1610612746)  &gt;You don’t have any facts to corroborate anything you’re saying  I don't have facts? Idk how old you are but I'm going to assume you're old enough to know that in academia, when you say statements that aren't common knowledge, you have to cite your sources. I've provided my proof twice now and you haven't even mentioned where you get your stuff from.   Some are defensive anchors and some are better one on one. I used Gobert as an example of a defensive anchor and Kawhi as a one on one defender. Simmons is another example of a one on one defender, which is why Gobert's going to win DPOY again, because Simmons doesn't affect his team defense compared to Gobert's impact, even though Simmons is an elite defender. That's why I used two different types of defenders, but maybe putting Simmons in that arguement instead of Kawhi would have made it easier.  Using my supreme emotional rose tinted reasoning, I have countered almost every major point you made."
Fun fact: Paul Millsap played for the Jazz and faced the Spurs in the 2007 WCF.
"All I'm saying is that people should give Jokic's teammates a little more respect. He for sure makes a lot of space and elevates his team. He's a big guy who seems like he can do literally everything. However...  In the regular seasons Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, and Paul Millsap have been putting up similar numbers on different teams for years. MPJ was one of the top prospects in 2017 and a first round pick. Jamal Murray is already good. Will Barton's numbers shot up as soon as he joined the Nuggets, before Jokic even joined them.  It's harder to tell with Monte Morris, Facundo and Markus Howard because they've only ever played with Jokic but I assume he just makes them better when he's on the floor with them, so you could be right about them."
He signed there for more then his market value since Denver has to overpay for FA’s. 2018 Paul Millsap in a vacuum is not worth $30 million a year
Paul Millsap did sign there in '17-18. But a Dame-caliber guy will probably never sign there.
PAUL MILLSAP CHAMPIONSHIP PAUL MILLSAP CHAMPIONSHIP PAUL MILLSAP CHAMPIONSHIP PAUL MILLSAP CHAMPIONSHIP PAUL MILLSAP CHAMPIONSHIP PAUL MILLSAP CHAMPIONSHIP
And that’s despite the fact that he didn’t touch the ball for like the last 3 minutes because Paul Millsap and Jamychal Green were chucking and wouldn’t pass to him
I remember Rodney Hood dueling Paul Millsap at the end
"So?  Folks ain't ever missed shots before?  Monte Morris blew a wide open layup and moments before that Paul Millsap also bricked an uncontested layup.  Then Monte Morris decided to miss a FREE THROW that would have ended the game.  So I don't know what you are on about.  Players miss shots, it happens.  If we are going to sit and compare the level of easily bricked shots, Monte and Paul's were easier than Covington's CONTESTED dunk which is the only reason he missed it."
paul millsap sounds like the name of the guy who calls you up to tell you that he's very sorry but your tax return has been filed incorrectly and could you please send him another IR-7g form before 5pm on friday and he'll try sort it for you but don't worry if not because he'll wipe the penalty for you
Watching paul millsap on offense is legitimately painful.
Wow yeah that Jazz team has to have the lowest CF win total in recent history. What a team though Dwill / Boozer / Okur / Fisher and a young Paul Millsap that averaged 7 pts/game
"MJ, Lebron, Shaq  And then when we go super peak, we've got Kobe going 81, Tmac 13 in 35, Reggie with 8 in 9, game six Klay, and shoutout to Paul Millsap going 11 points in 28 seconds against the heatles"
"JJ,Paul Millsap and DJJ talked about Gerssons pitches to them iirc.  Even Rosas took D'lo on a helicopter ride in the summer of 2019."
"Damn you're so bitter bro, Ayton is the suns defensive anchor and he has been great this season. Just cause Drummond has scored 1 on 1 against Ayton doesn't mean he's shit already  Thats like saying Jokic drops 35PPG and 35 year old Paul Millsap has scored on Nurkic 1-on-1 therefore Nurkic is not a great defender."
"Clippers have yet to win a playoff game since he decided to flex on Paul Millsap.  Now, they'll likely win this one; my point is that his front-running can backfire."
"Nothing crazy about that, Most of us clippers fans are used to these scenarios, 2014 playoffs against okc, 2015 against rockets, Last year Paul millsap playing big factor for denver in game 5 and 6. This year THJ and dorian finney smith not missing any three."
He's talking about Paul Millsap right?
If the likely outcome is Zach Collins or Paul Millsap then they will have failed at their attempts at getting an impact player.
Gonna fuck around and go nuts with a monster deal like offering Paul Millsap a hefty multi-year contract.   Maybe even Zach Collins.   Holy shit.
"Zach Collins, Larry Nance Jr. and Paul Millsap are considered ""major splash"" ?"
"Jared Dudley, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Paul Millsap, Mike Scott when he plays"
Paul Millsap
"well the good news is that there are more games, so we'll see. I would be careful glorifying winning a game against Denver tho. So what? They're missing Murray so it's not really a fair fight anyway, regardless of whether Jokic is the MVP. I'd say the terrible defense is attributed to the worst front-court 2nd unit in the NBA (all time?) on defense. Melo and Kanter are unwatchable, close to being unplayable and unfortunately, Portland has no one else to play. Dinosaur Paul Millsap shouldn't be lighting up your team and determining the game. I'd at least try Nassir Little in those minutes"
"I'm not sure what you have against Brown. Just earlier this season you made a huge post saying you were a Brown homer and wouldn't trade him for Harden. But now, you won't stop shitting on him and saying he's the worst player in the league. Dude shot 48/40/76 this year (all career highs on career attempts) and had a huge uptick in assists (2.1 to 3.4) while turnovers only went from 2.2 to 2.7. Yes his defense, particularly his team defense, was pretty bad this year, but I think with the roster churn and lack of practice, we saw pretty bad defense all around from the Celtics this year.   I think it was apparent that Rozier and Morris were the cancers in that locker room, although I'm sure Brown wasn't pleased being relegated to the bench either. The team's roster construction is what's poor at the moment. Smart needs to work on his facilitating and should be our starting PG. The team can then move Brown and Tatum to their correct positions (SG and SF) and then need a good stretch 4 or even 5 and have Williams start at either the 4 or 5.   Paul Millsap, although old, would be a solid veteran addition who is very switchable, has a respectable 3pt shot and can shoot inside. If we had more money, I'd chase Collins"

I love Paul millsap man
Paul Millsap: plays 1 minute in the first quarter.  Spero: Paul Millsap scores ALL 9 of his points IN THE SECOND QUARTER!
Paul Millsap is the team dad.
Paul Millsap should not be able to drive on anyone.
Paul millsap killing the blazers rn
"Yeah, not a homer take hopefully, but with Murray out, the rest of the team outside of Jokic and MPJ is scrubs. Gordon has been underwhelming to say the least, and the Nugget backcourt is poo-poo platter 10-day contract guys. The bench is just.... I mean Paul Millsap is playing meaningful minutes. It's really sad, cause at full strength the Nugz could contend for a title. Injuries suck."
Are any centres good vs elite pick and role players? Rudy Gobert was hiding in the corner on Paul Millsap because he couldn’t contain the Jokic/Jamal pick and role last playoffs.
"This take is getting old and boring. Rudy Gobert struggles vs elite pick and role players and Dame is near the best. Gobert was hiding on Paul Millsap in the corner like Trea Young by game 5 of the Nuggets series because he was incapable of containing the Jamal/Jokic pick and role. Almost every traditional centre struggles in the pick and role vs elite pick and role players.   According to synergy which has the video data of every pick and role every big has guarded all year Jokic grades out in the 71st percentile, and Nuggets as a whole were the 7th best in the league at defending such plays along with the 11 best defence overall.   https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nikola-jokic-nba-mvp-odds-analysis-matt-moore-2021  The Nuggets defence was bad all around game 1. Blown rotations when they brought a 3rd guy. Guards died on every screen. And, Portland shot the lights out and were crisp with their passing. They shot 50% during the competitive portion of the game from 3, and were 1 made 3 from a franchise record.   Portland will get buckets, but a little cooler shooting, and better defence will help."
"Look, was a business move. Atlanta needed a loud personality to have in town if they want to grow their fanbase. After Dominique, who did they even have? Joe Johnson? Quiet as a mf. Paul Millsap? Lmaooo not a star, just a great player. Trae is just that. Trendy guy, active on social media, etc., flashy game, loud. He's a hell of a player also. Yes he may not be a generational talent like Luka, but he should become a top 3 point guard. Luka as a personality is too quiet. Also he's European and Trae Young is a lightskin, way easier to connect with average Atlanta fans. Keep in mind, Atlanta has really weird racial dynamics and that the team has worked to bring in more of the african-american fans."
Where do we find another draymond green or paul millsap?
Paul Millsap like five years ago did that job pretty well. Also Jonathan Isaac but he’s hurt
honestly forgot Paul Millsap exists
"Who’s older, Carmelo or Paul Millsap?"
Nuggets really had Paul Millsap take their final shot the quarter
First technical odds:  +120 CJ McCollum +130 Carmelo Anthony +200 Campazzo +250 Jusuf Nurkic +320 Paul Millsap +400 Nikola Jokic
I doubt it. Paul Millsap was on that team at like 34 years old. That automatically messes up the median range. The Grizzlies oldest guy is like 28.
1. Dominique Wilkins 2. Dikembe Mutombo 3. Greivis Vasquez (Maryland fan) 4. Paul Millsap 5. Shawn Kemp 6. Clint Capela 7. Trae Young 8. Ben Wallace 9. Dennis Rodman 10. Derrick Rose
"Only for them to run into KD, Kyrie, and Harden on the same team in the East.  I remember Paul Millsap saying something about going West so he wouldn't have to meet Lebron, and then last year happens."
Paul millsap had 11 in like the last 24 seconds or something in regulation against Miami once. I also feel like Kyle Korver had a similar moment but I couldn’t give you the details
"The 2021 Suns feel like all those Al Horford/Paul Millsap Hawks from a number of years ago. They have an impressive regular season record, but no one takes them very serious in the playoffs."
"I don't agree that Green is better than Millsap.  Green has higher highs but lower lows.  When he is hitting from 3 he is great, but he has games where he just can't seem to defend without fouling, and also games where he can't hit shots (or finish dunks lol).  Paul on the other hand, is rarely terrible, but also rarely looks incredible.  He is reliable though, crafty around the basket, and is still a great help defender.  So they are both contributors, and if you really watch the Nuggets you know there is ZERO chance Moach goes completely against his nature of playing veterans.   He is not the type of coach who is willing to bench a vet even for a bad matchup unless they are playing really terribly."
Paul Millsap on what it’s like playing next to Nikola Jokic:     “It’s cheeseburgers. He’s throwing free cheeseburgers. I don’t eat cheeseburgers ... but if they’re free...”
"Since Murray's injury, they've had the same level of supporting talent, actually I'd argue worst because their rotation players/starters in Austin Rivers, Facu Campazzo, Paul Millsap, Shaq Harrison wouldn't get minutes on this current Golden State squad."
LordTreeSap is just a mech version of Paul Millsap CMV
I couldn't remember the details so I looked it up. Looks like this is what happened lol:  &gt;...apparently upset over a non-call on the Nuggets' Paul Millsap. Millsap was defending LaMarcus Aldridge in the post. Aldridge turned around for a short jumper with Millsap in his face and missed the attempt. Popovich shot out of his chair on the bench complaining then called a timeout and continued to protest the non-call to official Mark Ayotte. Popovich was hit with two technical fouls and shown the door for the fastest ejection this season...
"The traditional power forward, who did the dirty work and shot 15-18 ft jumpers with a little bit of post offense. Think Horace Grant, Dale Davis, PJ Brown, Tyrone Hill, etc. In today's league, either you are big enough that you're just a center now (Derrick Favors), you've expanded to the three point line (Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap), or both (Serge Ibaka). Or like AD, you just slide between the two positions."
"I could see him becoming a Paul millsap type in his prime, but with maybe better offensive skills. His defence when he’s on is very good and his offence reminds me so much of kawhi , hope he continues to improve for many years. More international stars from different countries is always good for the league"
"Doesn't matter, he's shooting over 60% from the field because as long as you're a good cutter and do things off ball Jokic will find you  Jerami Grant is a bigger sample size then, for the Nuggets with Jokic 60% TS, without him his career TS% is basically 55%~, Paul Millsap has been way more efficient with Jokic too than he was as a 2nd option in Atlanta"
Like I said. Look at the rosters and the minute allocations for both those teams. Denver had significantly more injuries and Paul Millsap both missed more games and was a year older. With the Spurs their entire starting lineup was pretty much different except for Aldridge. The Spurs also allowed opponents to shoot the same 3P% in both those seasons. Luck wasn’t the reason for their decline in defense.
Our biggest free agency get for the last 20 years is paul millsap and IT post cleveland
The biggest name FA to sign with Denver has been Paul Millsap. Not a superstar but definitely makes your point
Paul Millsap and Al Horford
"It’s exactly as Paul Millsap said, Jokic just out here hand feeding people burgers. If you cut or get in position he will give you the ball on a silver platter 100% of the time, and Gordon has great energy and above average BBIQ from what I’ve seen.  I legit think we have a shot at the finals this year, and I didn’t last year, even when we were in the WCF lol"
Name one person on that roster that is better than this years Jazz. Pero Antic?  Kent Bazemore?  Elton Brand?  DeMarre Carroll?  Austin Daye?  Al Horford?  John Jenkins?  Kyle Korver(ILY)?  Shelvin Mack(UPSHELVINS)?  Paul Millsap(ILY2)?  Mike Muscala?  Adreian Payne?  Dennis Schroder?  Mike Scott?  Thabo Sefolosha?  Jeff Teague?
Malcolm Brogdon Paul Millsap Trae Young Tyrese Haliburton Marc Gasol  Winning type unathletic players
"Conaidering the roster Bud was working with, he gets far too much criticism for that series (and I'm no Bud apologist or anything).  That Hawks team had a starting 5 of Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, DeMarre Carroll, Paul Millsap, and Al Horford.  Their main bench players were Dennis Schröder, Kent Bazemore, Mike Scott, and Pero Antić.  Lots of solid players, but does it really surprise you that Lebron swept them when he pretty much single handedly brought the Warriors to 6 in the finals? (plus he had Irving in 2 of the games against the hawks vs just 1 game in the finals)"
What an asinine comment. A team whos best player is Paul Millsap doesnt usually win 60 games and make an ECF lmao. Bud is an *over*achiever in the regular season whose teams regress to what they really are in the playoffs.
"That’s the risk you take. If they develop a shot, then you’ve got a scary athletic player that can shoot. See: Richard Jefferson, Aaron Gordon, Kawhi, Paul Millsap, Jerami Grant, D Rose, Amare Stoudamire. All athletic guys that couldn’t shoot but learned to."
It’s not slander this is if everything goes right for obi and his development I’m talking Paul Millsap offensively not defensively
He’s looking more like Derrick Williams rather than Paul Millsap.
"Players / teams taking control. Say what you want about the kawhi spurs from a few yrs ago but he started this. He took control from owners.  Nets put it to the fucking forefront this season(when you fuck the nba signing rules like hedge funds bend over the SEC) and have Monstars roster.   Regular season doesn't matter. Get to the playoffs with healthy players then they ball out. Who's more likely to get hurt? Dude playing for 8 months at 75-90% or dude playing for 3 months at 95%    This will be how it is going forward. Players will always be ""hurt"". Granted some ppl really are hurt but when charles oakley came back early because he was tough paul millsap will take a night off bc his toenail is crooked (don't know I used him as example other than I seen him on sideline last night vs clippers )   Why bust your ass for 82 games when you can get paid the same, if not more, as cap rises and rich get richer . At what point do these counteracts strike anyone else as rediculous? Anyway this is the new NbA. Get ready, NFL players will do this also given the extended season coming up. Guys will be out for 2-3 weeks for a jammed ear when their team has a playoff seed locked."
You have to have stats on some level. Paul Millsap wasn't going to be the MVP when Hawks won 60+ games.
I mean I'm the only basketball fan he knows and my favorite player is Paul Millsap.  It seems weird that he would pick up on Jokic instead of Millsap if he was only influenced by others' taste.
"Paul Millsap and thank god it's happened.   He still has the size/strength, BBIQ and skill to beat up bench players, but good defenses made him useless in our starting lineup."
"Reminds me of the WCF game 5, Denver against Lakers, AD lands on top of Paul Millsap taking a corner three late in the 4th when Denver is within 2 possessions and no call. Denver (along with half the other small market teams) gets no respect from the refs."
Paul Millsap and JaMychal Green
"Presidential candidate, paul millsap"
"It’s pretty obvious you don’t watch the nuggets or Timberwolves. Jokic didn’t “carry” his team to the playoffs until 2019 when the nuggets had a starting lineup of Jokic, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, and Will Barton. If that’s a poor supporting cast then then I don’t want to know what the Timberwolves roster is. Also you said Kat was not a leader because he was the second best player on the team when they made it to the playoffs. That was KAT’s third year in the league, when Jokic was in his third year, the nuggets didn’t even make it to the playoffs. Why don’t you hold Jokic to the same standard as KAT, if he’s on such a different level skill wise, shouldn’t he have been able to bring his team to the playoffs even if they were poor?"
"Wait there is a superstar on the nuggets not named Jokic?  Why did no body tell me we got another superstar?  There is literally only one other player on this squad that has ever even been an all-star (much less a superstar), and that is Paul Millsap four years ago.    The Nuggets only have one superstar, and a solid supporting cast, but calling anyone else on this team a superstar is an absolute joke."
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2). These 3 teams are considered by most to be in the range of ""fringe contenders"" to ""playoff lock but nothing more"". Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders. Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years:  * LeBron * Kawhi * KD * Kyrie * Blake Griffin * LaMarcus Aldridge * Serge Ibaka"
PG - Joe Ingles  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jae Crowder  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Rudy Gobert  Basically a worse version of the current Utah Jazz. We'd likely be a 4-6 seed in the West this season and lose in the first round to the Lakers.
No disrespect to Paul Millsap but he had no business starting on this team. Love his hustle and veteran leadership but he’s 36 and plays like it most of the time. A young freak athlete like Gordon is obviously going to change how things look.
"Paul Millsap yelled, “There you go!” Michael Porter JR gave a look of pleasant surprise. JaMychal Green belted, “We got an [expeltive] squad now.” And before Nikola Jokic could hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Allen Iverson hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Paul Millsap does look like.... nvm
"Young Paul Millsap is not our ideal 4 though, at least offensively. Paul was more of a traditional post player, as the Utah Paul would get 20-10 and not step outside the paint. he developed the three later in his career.   Defensively yeah"
"With Jokic, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, MPJ and now Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee, the Nuggets are stacked. Murray would be the best guard on the floor in that series and Jokic the best big man. Stopping Jokic would be a hard task for the Clippers."
"They were both 1 time all stars as 3rd and 4th options on a Jazz team that featured Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer as their 1-2 punch on a Jazz team that gave teams fits in the playoffs up until 2010, including going to the conference finals in 2007. That team also had solid role players such as Ronnie Brewer, Matt Harpring, Kyle Korver and Paul Millsap. AK47 was a versatile defender who could guard multiple positions and was an excellent passer and shot blocker for his size, but was limited with scoring. Okur was your prototypical stretch 5 who was ahead of his time, and could hit the open three, but was limited on defense and rebounding despite being 6'11"". They would both thrive today."
"Lol it's not even close to the Nets' level. It'd be more accurate if say, Lakers traded Caruso, Kuzma &amp; Danny green for Damian Lillard. And then picked up Paul Millsap, John Collins, and somehow acquired Seth Curry. And Clint Capela"
Paul Millsap is not a solid role player this year. Jamychal Green has missed a lot of games. And Will Barton is pretty much putting up the same stats as Carmelo Anthony but we're forced to start him.
"Don’t forget about Paul Millsap, Will Barton, JaMychal Green, I mean they have quite a few really solid role players. There’s a reason they’re in contention for the conference championship and potentially a title. Portland is Damian’s Band of Misfit Toys and Talent. He sent my entire franchise to the shadow realm, and I still want this man to get MVP. I really don’t understand how people can possibly argue the value Dame has to Portland. He is one of a VERY select few players whose max contracts are actually undervaluing them as assets."
"he's a good defender. Nuggets are 15th in defense or exactly average with Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, MPJ, Will Barton, Facu, 36 year old paul millsap and Jamichael Green playing most of the minutes. Jokic is literally the best defeder on the Nuggets other than Gary Harris who has barely played this year."
"For some reason I read that as ""Paul Millsap came up to him and retired."""
Is there anyone who DOESN'T love Paul Millsap? He's just the best teammate and one of the best dudes in the NBA.
"[Still feeling pretty good about my preseason takes](https://np.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/k96xlu/wind_when_news_broke_weeks_ago_that_denver_was/gf2oc5f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  &gt;***For point 3:*** *We might have a small-ball bench with both Green and Millsap as our 2nd unit 4 and 5. Both players are getting older and its more important they are healthy come playoff time than coming off a career statistical year. As long as they get diverse experience with different lineups I expect them to each have a more reduced role, particularly Paul in the regular season to both preserve them going forward and free up minutes for Bol, Hartenstein, Nnaji, etc. Granted, they each might look great and be very difficult to take off the court. A good problem to have.*"
"""Spins Paul Millsap around"", not ""spins around Paul Millsap"""
"that squad had it all. young Schröder, Mike Scott, prime Horford, Kyle Korver, Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, over the hill Elton Brand, Mike Moose, Thabo  definitely one of my favorite teams to watch back than"
"Probably a favor for Paul Millsap but he is 6’6 225, a typical build for SG"
"&gt; as it inflates people who play less than 20ish minutes stats extremely high.  I suggest you read up on something that was named after the Paul Millsap a long time ago called the [Millsap Doctrine](https://web.archive.org/web/20080122202848/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/). They looked at players who suddenly went from low MPG to high amount of MPG because of an injury or suspension from the player ahead of them to rule out players who got more minutes because they are playing better. Found that players actually played the same if not better when they got more minutes. Of course not gonna work when someone has like a single digit MPG and/or very few game sample size. However, if you have a decent sample size of games and MPG, it translates very well."
"It just means that he doesn't have the mindset of the greatest of each eras. But hey it's alright, every era needs that Paul Millsap type player where they'll make a few all stars and that's it, they don't go deeper to be an all time great"
Paul Millsap was a 4x all star lol. Because he was in the East. D'angelo Russell made an all star team
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn’t pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‘04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‘05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‘06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‘07: Durant (#2 — sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
Paul Millsap
Lol you guys really have no idea how inconsistent Denvers line ups have been do you? Mpj missed 3 weeks in Jan. Gary Harris (our best defender..) has missed over half he season.  Jamychal green missed 15 games and Paul Millsap came back yesterday after 3 weeks off.  Outside of Portland I can't think of any team that's getting screwed worse from Injuries/covid.  Also calling Denver the 5th seed is funny. Until Lakers won their game yesterday they were the 4th seed. Let's not act like they're miles ahead. It's a close race
"in fact he really should've made it in his rookie year, iirc he got pretty badly snubbed for Paul Millsap."
Kevin Willis played with Dominique Wilkins and played against Paul Millsap in his NBA career
Paul Millsap would like a word
"Hasn't MPJ shown a lot more promising results at the 4 versus the 3?  I know MPJ playing the 4 was a result of Paul Millsap and JaMychal Green being injured but Millsap's washed anyways. No reason that MPJ couldn't be the starting 4 for the rest of the season next to Barton.  I kind of figured that Gary Harris would be the most expendable since he continues to fall off a cliff offensively but I know his defense is valuable. He's way overpaid though and wouldn't have any trade value.   Either way, losing Grant sucked. Barton's too undersized for the 3."
"PHO would actually really benefit from having a post-up threat over than Ayton (also could be a mentor ie. Chris Paul)  BOS has no use for Aldridge. He’s negative defensively and they don’t need more bigs.  MIA would be cool, as a bigger Jae Crowder on offense. Although I don’t Aldridge is *thaaat* much better than Olynyk right now, especially not on that contract.  DEN needs defense, they’re set offensively. No need to get someone who’s just gonna take minutes away form Millsap, their 2nd best defender."
"I just want them to bring Paul Millsap back for purely sentimental reasons. My favorite Jazzman of the late 00's/early 10's. Besides Ronnie Brewer, of course"
An inconsistent and soft but taller version of Paul Millsap and without a 3-ball.
"I totally forgot about that craziness. Gordon Hayward, AL Jefferson and Paul Millsap were balling for you guys once Deron Williams and AK were gone"
Paul Millsap
"I used to bartend in SLC and the night before the Jazz played the Lakers in the playoffs Paul Millsap, CJ Miles and one of the rookies got shit hammered at my bar and left at like 1:30am"
"Nets players can't practice at the facility if they are not vaccinated, so my guess are players who haven't been at the facility recently. Lamarcus Aldridge, with his heart condition and Paul Millsap, whose been practicing elsewhere."
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
"The DWill and Boozer teams had a ton of talent though. Outside of them there was AK47, Mehmet Okur, Ronnie brewer who was a great 3 and D player, as well as Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver off the the bench. That’s 6 guys between the ages of 22 and 28 who were at some point in their career an all star. At the time it seemed like they overachieved, but in retrospect it really doesn’t feel that way. They only made the WCF because the mavs choked against the warriors."
"He said he couldn't recall a worse team over performing so I had to remind him. Point is that I can do the same thing OP did for Lebron for a lot of players and it's not something special when it's a different player. Paul Millsap took the Hawks to 1st seed with Korver as his 2nd best player. But no one cares about Millsap am I right.  Also that cavs team was far from bad, or did Lebron guard all 5 players at the same time so they could have 3rd best D in the league? I'm tired of nephews that started watching basketball when Lebron joined the Lakers go on basketball reference look at stats and make random stupid conclusion like Lebron played with some G league players.   But on the other hand I understand stans, they got to do all on their power to try and make Lebron look better, but no matter how many stupid pointless threads like this they make, he can't touch the GOAT"
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
"You’re paying young players this type of money for the type of potential they bring, not what they are right now. That’s always how it has been.   We got clowned for paying Murray the max extension after his rookie deal. Look where we are now, you can’t say the deal wasn’t worth. So it seems a bit disingeneous to claim that people don’t see that the Nuggets are paying for what he could be rather than what he is right now. Especially for a small market team whose biggest free agent signing was old Paul fucking Millsap. It’s not like we can sit on our hands waiting for this type of player to walk through the door"
"Paul Millsap got 30 millions for 12/7/2  Mason P. got 14 millions for 7/5/2.5  Barton got 16 for 12/4/3 ( 4 rebounds because he had stats pading with chasing rebounds, leaving the perimeter, atrocity defense) 107-114 off.def rating per 100 possesion and bpm -2.0 🙄  FO has been making big mistakes for 5 years now. Denver would already be champion if they had other players instead of Millsap, Barton, Mason. Millsap took over 110 million for a very average game. He was nowhere to be seen in key games (except for a quarter against the Clippers) a totally missed investment. FO spends the best of Jokic's years. Denver is a wonderful franchise, wonderful people, fans, FO, journalists, etc., but they just can't understand some things. Barton was a deep bench guy in Portland, literally barely an NBA player and in Denver he got 30+ minutes a year.   Gordon at least plays defense and this is ok but there are a lot of mistakes 🙄"
"Jerami Grant's best game was far and away the playoff game against the Lakers where he had 26 and helped us win.  Game 3.     Here's the problem, he started that game alongside Paul Millsap.  MPJ only played 22 minutes total and was very limited.  In Grant's best game he really wasn't doing what we expected him to do when we signed him here.  That doesn't take anything away from JG.     He is a good wing defender, but he wanted a bigger offensive role ever since he was on OKC.  We expected him to be a cutter opening up the offense for easy baskets with a lot of offball movement, to be able to knock down 3's to basically replace what Paul Millsap does for us.     He did not do that in that game, or really ever his entire year with us.  I'm glad we did not re-sign him, because he was not a good fit with MPJ and I think ultimately we made the right choice in choosing between those two.     Gordon immediately started eating the free cheeseburgers that Jokic hands out as Millsap so perfectly framed it.  He knows the role.  His cutting to open up  the iconic MPJ 3 last playoffs against the Blazers, and then making the 3 that iced the series was what we needed from Grant.  He was never that, he is a great player and can do things that Gordon probably won't for us.      We are lucky Gordon buys into a role that compliments our other stars like Murray, MPJ, and Jokic.  Ultimately that is more important than which one puts up more points per game."
That one year people were convinced Omer Asik was better than Paul Millsap (one year before Millsap became an all-star)
Paul Millsap and Jeff Green were both designed to be big 3 superstars. Big guys with decent jumpshots who can guard just about anyone? Yup
Paul millsap
"Lonzo, Drummond, Westbrook, Derozan, Zach Randolph, Joakim Noah, Josh Smith, Paul Millsap, Stoudemire, Bynum, Wiggins, Carmelo Anthony  And finally:  *Chris Paul*"
"So a team with 9 guys that are legit players is bad depth now? And Paul Millsap and James Johnson are solid rotation pieces who are first off the bench guys for many other teams.  I don’t see what teams really have much better benches than that. Then we also have Cam Thomas, of which many believe he will be a great player, Jevon Carter who could probs be a second string PG on a different team, and some solid dudes 13-15. Sure we may lose a game if all three are out, but that happened like once all last year. We also fell into a bit of a hole early without a roster close to as good as it is now. The nets had one of the most crazily fluctuating rosters in the league last season and still were better than the bucks. I don’t see why their depth is so much better than ours."
It wasn’t the coach’s speech. Right after this Paul Millsap and Matcus Morris get into it. Paul put the team in his back briefly to get us back into it. He sparked the whole thing.
"Honestly, if not for Paul goddamn Millsap the Nuggets lose in game 5"
Shoutout Marcus Morris for unleashing Paul Millsap in this game  Vote 4 Millsap
"&gt;7M Paul Millsap: vs Cavaliers - 22 pts, 4 reb, 3 ast, 2 stl, 7/8 fg, 2/3 3pt, 6/7 ft in 27 minutes.  This is actually one of the most impressive lines from a 7th man on here."
The man who's led his team to the best regular season record 2 times and won a championship in the last 3 seasons.      Also the dude who won 60 games with Paul Millsap/Al Horford as the teams best player
Paul Millsap should be on the list instead of Taj Gibson
"I think the wings suck.   Looking at their playoff bench, it's probably   PG: Mills  SG: Bruce Brown or MAYBE Cam Thomas if he breaks out  SF: James Johnson  PF: Paul Millsap  C: Whichever big is appropriate for the matchup (either LMA or Claxton)  Losing Jeff Green was a big blow. I like Brown and Johnson but neither of those guys are shooters. But hopefully if you're running a bunch of other sharp shooters on the floor the gravity will be too much to ignore.  Overall, the bench is a bit deeper than I expected but if they have to cut down to an 8-man group it may be rough."
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
Paul millsap has slowed down but he’s still an excellent defensive presence that can shoot and bang in the post. He’s easily the best defender on the team now. I’d consider him a game changer
"That’s also due to them not drafting well and terrible asset management. They had the 10th pick in the 2004 draft, they could’ve traded that pick plus some players and moved up to get a player drafted before the 10th pick (Igudola could’ve been his Scottie in Cleveland) or they could’ve picked Josh Smith, JR Smith or Jameer Nelson instead of Luke Jackson. Could’ve drafted Paul Millsap in 06."
"Signed Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, James Johnson, got off Deandre Jordan’s contract and got a high potential player for him. Drafted Cam Thomas (summer league MVP) and Dayron Sharpe"
"""Jeff Green's contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap""  How tf do you even know that? The season hasn't started yet. You're only going off what you've seen, and I'm not even sure you saw it enough, because Green had his flaws too. Wasn't much of a defender and had plenty of super quiet games.  It's like anything the Nets did well, you're just tryna discredit because they're not the Lakers. Which... I mean, they signed washed players too. But washed doesn't always mean bad, depending on how the team uses them."
"&gt; I mean, what exactly could the Nets have done in your opinion to even have this supposed ""top 3"" offseason? Like that's ridiculous lol  Nets really couldn’t have. Unless they traded Joe Harris for like Myles Turner or something and ended the league. That’s what happens when you’re over the cap and can only offer minimum deals and a MLE.   &gt; I graded them on extending KD, which is enormous on its own right, because he's arguably the best player in the game right now. If not, top 3 no debate. THAT can't just be ignored, idk what you're talking about there.  But again there are 4 other franchise corner stones who got extended. They aren’t anywhere near mentioned as a top offseason winner. An extension, (unless it’s like Giannis when people think he was a strong chance at leaving) isn’t a big win. It’s a good move but if that’s your best move you’re not a top offseason.  &gt; Second, ""Mills was getting the deal no matter where he went"" What? So because that you think that, that automatically makes the Nets getting him a lesser value. And how does Millsap being a late signing matter? It's a signing in the offseason, who tf cares when it happens?  For Mills It means they’re a top FA destination and didn’t get huge discounts, unlike the Lakers. It doesn’t make it a lesser value but it puts the Lakers offseason over theirs, LAARP or not. Millsap is washed and if he was a hot FA commodity he’d be signed the first week.   &gt; And for as good as Jeff Green was, you're treating him like he would be the sole reason the Nets would win a championship. There's a reason why he's a journeyman.  You’re right but honestly Jeff Green’s contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap."
"So reading this comment made me curious what kind of fit I could find for ben. Booted up 2k and started a new myleague season.   (Disclaimer: the roster I used was from around the trade deadline I think so obv this wouldn't be viable at all rn.)   I made a 3 team trade between Nuggets, 76ers, Nets.  Denver receives: Ben Simmons  76ers receive: Aaron Gordon, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nuggets 1st round 2023, Nuggets 2nd round 2023  Nets Receive: Paul Millsap, Nuggets 1st round 2025, Nuggets 2nd round 2022  Denver: &gt;Give up Gordon and Millsap but get Ben Simmons who is switched to the 4 to play alongside Jokic. I think Simmons could end up being a younger better Aaron Gordon for the Nuggets if he's playing out of the 4.   76ers:  &gt;No longer have Ben crowding the paint at PG. Get Aaron Gordon to basically do what ben did for cheaper and he doesn't have to also be your guard. Spencer Dinwiddie becomes the starting point and can actually space the floor and handle the ball to take pressure off Embiid.   Nets:  &gt;Give up Dinwiddie but they already had Harden and Irving so didn't really need him all **that** much. End up getting Millsap just like IRL and some future draft picks to either flip for more vets or bolster their roster in a few years as their vets begin to age out.   So what do you think? Honestly I think it worked out not so bad for all 3 teams. I'm gonna sim the season out to see how they end up."
I'm actually surprised Paul Millsap was an all star 4 times.
Paul Millsap is also on the Nets
PG: Kyrie  SG: Harden  SF: LeBron PF: Kevin  C: AD  BPG: Russ  BSG: Malik  BSF: Melo  BPF: Blake  BC: Dwight  11M: Lamarcus  12M: Millsap 13M: Bazemore  NP: Chris Paul  NP: Claxton   How much help does Malik Monk need?
"Really random, but does anyone else think Paul Millsap has a very trustworthy face. Idk if I’ve ever seen an interview with him or heard about anything off the court, he just looks like a trustworthy guy"
What is a paul millsap
Paul millsap
Michael Porter Jr? Paul Millsap?
"There still were Pau and prime Marc Gasol in the league. Tim Duncan had one down year but was still a great player with the entire arsenal. LMA was still young and was Portland's best player. Kevin Love played some all-time seasons with the Wolves operating as a post players almost entirely, Boogie Cousins was emerging and AD was drafted the season after '12. Chris Bosh dominated the post but played a different role in Miami. Al Jefferson was a post maestro and in his prime, David West played really well and Paul Millsap was averaging 17 with a great post move arsenal. Oh and Dirk was still All-NBA level.  Not saying he didn't have a argument for one of the best post players but saying no guys with good post moves were in the league until Jokic and Embiid is way off."
"They went 23-7 against the West, and actually had a better winning% against those teams than they did the East.  If you think a starting five of Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll is even remotely matching those Harden Rockets teams you're on another planet."
"He's as much a star at this point as Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap... Aja he used to be one but now isn't"
"I was scrolling a little too fast and thought this said Paul Millsap, D’Angelo Russell, and Ben Simmons have agreed to a deal with the Brooklyn Nets"
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity
"definitely not a one for one, Jeff Green essentially got flipped for Patty Mills and Paul Millsap which i'd do any day"
Because it “feels” like a much bigger signing than anyone actually thinks it is so people’s first reaction is to downplay it.   No one thinks Paul Millsap is the missing piece that will take the nets from title favorites to the most unbeatable force the nba has ever seen. However he should be a quality role player with the potential to become a major piece in a championship run
"Seriously, it's still Westbook, Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kyrie, Harden and Durant along with Carmelo, Dwight, Rondo, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus and Paul Millsap, all in one series.   Even with a bunch of these guys as old as they are it's still a crazy matchup."
"Are they better than they were yesterday? Probably. Millsap can give you some decent spot minutes as long as you don’t rely on him heavily.  Are they better than they were last year with Jeff Green in that role? Debatable.  The Denver Nuggets had the option available to them, and they chose to sign Jeff Green over Millsap. And this is an organization who not only was a contender, but has been fiercely loyal to their own guys and bringing them back for continuity.  If they made the decision that Jeff green was a better option for their backup frontcourt than Millsap was, that probably tells you something about where they see Paul at this stage of his career.  So if you believe that the Nets upgraded by going from Jeff Green to an aging Paul Millsap, that’s fine (and trust me, I love dad as much as anyone), but just know that one of the shrewdest FOs in basketball right now is actively disagreeing with that take."
"Undersized bigs generally fall off pretty quickly in the NBA and even though Draymond is one of the smartest players in NBA history, there comes a point in time where your body just can't do the things that your mind is telling it to do at the speed that you're used to.   At this point in his career, Draymond's value comes solely from the fact that he's one of the Top 5 defensive players in NBA history, his offensive production is non-existent and that's not going to change, and nor should it, he should be on teams where he isn't expected to contribute points. As he gets older and loses some lateral quickness to the point that he can't stay in front of most guards, he probably becomes more of a 5 than a 4, and he is at a severe size disadvantage at that position, and most importantly, it really kills the Warriors ability to rebound when he plays the 5.   To be clear, I think Draymond still has 2-3 years left where he's an incredible defensive player, I'm just saying that when that decline hits, it will hit fast. Not exactly the best comp here, but somebody like Paul Millsap went from being a starter on a team that made the Conference Finals in the bubble, to signing for the vet min. in *September* a year later."
The Nets technically swapped Jeff Green to the Nuggets for Paul Millsap
Yep Paul Millsap should be leading his own team to the finals he's definitely good enough imo
hi im paul millsap and ive just coalesced into a big net
"Paul Millsap has put in *time* at the Jazz, the Hawks, and the Nuggets. Fuck out of here with that bullshit."
Makes sense.  Paul Millsap is the ‘bacon egg and cheese’ of league forwards.
"Maybe it's not a binary world, and Paul Millsap can be not that great anymore but still a player most teams would want to add for a minimum and he's gone to the superteam that's piling up vets on underpaid contracts."
Paul Millsap signs with netw
Because they added washed Paul Millsap?
"Lmao, 37 year old Paul Millsap is definitely far beyond any resemblance of a 3&amp;D player"
"Jeff Green is definitely better than Paul Millsap, but Millsap is definitely a solid pick up nonetheless."
Paul Millsap was likely getting the minimum no matter who he chose. It makes sense that if the money is the same everywhere that they choose a team that can realistically win a championship.
"honest question, who is a better role player: Jeff Green or Paul Millsap"
"Damn, 6’8 manlet Paul Millsap really ruins it."
"While Millsap was born in Louisiana and returned when he was 13, [he moved when he was 2/3](http://grantland.com/features/the-quiet-man-paul-millsap-nba-playoffs-2015-atlanta-hawks-cleveland-cavaliers-eastern-conference-utah-jazz/) to the [Montbello neighbourhood](https://milehighsports.com/paul-millsap-grateful-to-return-to-his-childhood-home-montbello/) in Denver. In his mother Bettye's words: “Paul Millsap was more raised in Denver, Colorado than he was in Louisiana”"
"&gt; So does LaMelo, once his body fills out he’ll be capable of defending 1-4  How much are you expecting him to fill out, exactly?   There's lots of guys who came in with ""once they fill out"" who never filled out. Shaun Livingston never turned into Paul Millsap, Corey Brewer never turned into Elton Brand."
Same way Paul Millsap winds up on Denver despite being from Louisiana
Paul Millsap.
Paul Millsap was far better at his age when he got his contract than Aaron Gordon is at his current age
"DeMarcus Cousins and Paul Millsap are still out there as free agents. Also Kevin Love could be bought out at any moment, so the Lakers can easily have 10+ career All-Stars if they wanted.  The Lakers gotta catch 'em all!"
Can we get a 4? Paul Millsap or Kevin Love?
Paul millsap would be a great piece to any team really hope the bulls pick him up!
"08 Jazz were low key stacked. DWill, Ronnie Brewer, AK47, Boozer and Okur starting and all 28 or under, plus Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver off the bench. That group really should’ve accomplished more than they did."
This would happen with Paul Millsap trying to finish at the rim all the time
Paul Millsap finna sign with the Lakers.
"Lol actually didn't know joker had a lambo SUV. I saw he had a Volvo SUV a couple seasons back so assumed that's what he drove  Yeah Paul Millsap definitely is different, I just feel like the amount of players that have 50+ pairs of sneakers are more often than not Americans. There's definitely exceptions, Timmy D wore 4 pairs for the whole season I'm pretty sure. But then there's your pj tuckers of the world who have literally hundreds of pairs."
In the bubble last year Denver played a game and I think their shortest player on the court was Paul millsap? It was definitely someone around ~6’8
Massive win for the Bulls.  Granted they still need a backup power forward but they can get one for the minimum or maybe use the picks in a sign and trade for Paul Millsap with Denver if possible.
"Hey there, cheers.   I think it's wrong to stereotype players like that based on such generalized terms. Paul Millsap doesn't give a shit about shoes and shoe culture just as much as Jokic does.  Also, Joker drives a giant yellow Lamborghini SUV, he's not as different as you think lol"
Hotake: Paul Millsap Ben Simmons LeBron James
Never forget Paul Millsap did something similar. 11 points in 28 seconds against the heatles.
"Paul Millsap is the funniest to me. The definition of jaw dropping in live and living color. Rarely do you see opposing benches react like that and they already knew in real time it was insane. Get em next time, Lonnie."
"DENVER NUGGETS  PG: D.J. Augustin   SG: Andre Iguodala   SF: Carmelo Anthony   PF: Danilo Gallinari   C: Mason Plumlee  BENCH: Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, JaVale McGee, Trey Lyles, Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant"
I'll try to use non-superstar examples  PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - CJ McCollum  SF - Khris Middleton  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Jonas Valanciunas
And you think that adding Paul Millsap is going to be the tipping point?
Doc would 100% find an excuse to play them together.  I'd much rather roll the dice with Bball Paul and Niang getting minutes rather than bringing in Millsap.
Jokic  Jamal Murray  MPJ Junior  Will Barton  Paul Millsap

"&gt;8-0 is extremely impressive in its own right because of how the trajectories of both players (and teams) have changed since that day.   What trajectories? KAT has become the best shooting big man in the history of the NBA since that day and you act like he's some scrub lol.  The only difference between them is that Jokic had a competent HC and FO to use him correctly and build around him properly.  Y'all gave him Jamal Murry,MPJ and Paul Millsap (before he fell off) and we gave KAT Jeff Teague and Wiggins."
Paul Millsap
The last thing y’all need is a billion year old Paul Millsap.
Maybe a center? It's pretty thin out there at C though and they're already paying Adams a shit ton.  Edit: Paul Millsap makes sense. He's not going to make them a playoff team though.
"Paul Millsap when he was in Utah, he didn't get his due attention until Atlanta.  Now, its gotta be Gobert. He is incredibly impactful, best defender in the league, and many people still don't think he's worth a max contract. We've been missing our all star guards Conley and Mitchell for nearly a month and Gobert and company have held the 1 seed including some big wins along the way."
My favorite player exactly 10 years ago was Paul Millsap. Now its 100% Joe Ingles.
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
I always wanted Paul Millsap on the Spurs. I always thought he would be a good fit.
"Yeah Paul Millsap being a four-time all-star still blows my mind. Like I remember him being good, but not *that* good! The East was pretty weak during that time though"
Paul Millsap? never heard of him
"If we had the roster to limit his role to bringing him off the bench for like 10-15 mins a game, it'd be fine (though I expect he'd still make just as many boneheaded plays as good ones). With our roster depleted, he's playing too many minutes and is way, way out of his depth.  I remember he used to start for those Budenholzer Hawks teams... Not sure how they were able to have a 60 win season w/ him starting. Maybe his low IQ play was made up for by high IQ play by Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, etc..."
Yeah but then you come into the situation like us where DJJ had the choice between Portland and us and chose Portland or where the aging Paul Millsap could choose starting for us or staying on the bench for the Nuggets.  Besides not like you've had any significant capspace in the past 10 years
"&gt;That doesn't matter. They don't need good vets to get better, they're trying to build organically. No good vets are coming anyway because it's Oklahoma City. Just like they don't come to Washington or Phoenix or Minnesota.  I mean they brought in CP3 and signed Jae Crowder who has been one of the biggest reasons for their dominance this year. Like no one wanted to sign with us last off-season because no one believed yet in the KAT/D'lo/Ant pairing. We whiffed on Derrick Jones Jr. and Paul Millsap btw.  So yeah until the Thunder proves they can win again they won't be considered a FA destination for vets."
Paul Millsap
"&gt; Obviously he ended up being right so kudos to him, but Jokic is really the exception not the rule when it comes to good advanced stats on low volume players.  People say this every year, and it's just not true. This happens all the time. [Back in 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071122115204/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/), you had articles talking about this phenomenon, finding that players forced into more minutes actually *improved* with the larger role. They called it the Paul Millsap doctrine, based on his stellar per-minute play as Carlos Boozer's backup holding up excellently when Boozer got injured and he became a starter.  There's been tons of examples of it ever since.  * James Harden put up great per-minute scoring numbers on an insane .660 TS% in his last year in OKC (back in 11-12, that TS% was even more impressive than it is now), and then people were shocked that he continued to be an amazing scorer when he went to Houston. * Clint Capela averaged 13 and 8 on 64% shooting in 24 mpg in 16-17; a couple years later, he averaged 17 and 13 on 65% shooting in 33 mpg. His per-minute and per-possession stats were basically unchanged; he just was on the floor for more time per game. * Christian Wood came off the bench for his first 50 games last season; he averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds per 36 on 66% TS, in an 18 mpg role. He became a starter for the last 12 games when Drummond was shut down; he put up 23 points and 10 rebounds per 36 on 65% TS in the larger role, playing 35 mpg. This year, as a full-time starter in Houston, he's again averaging 23 and 11 per 36.  I could go on for a while. There are going to be some failure modes here; you can't extrapolate a tiny sample, and if someone plays only 5 mpg in garbage time that's not the same as even a 24 mpg role. Maybe you adjust a guy's performance down a couple percentage points for fatigue, though you could also adjust it up due to finding more of a rhythm in the game.  And Jokic showed his greatness early too. As a rookie, he was averaging 10-7-2 in 22 minutes on .580 TS%. There was nothing at all ridiculous about saying he was better than Porzingis (14-7-1 in 28 minutes on .518 TS%). Per possession, Jokic did almost everything better, which explains why all advanced stats had him significantly better. By year 2, he was averaging 17-10-5 on 64 TS% in 28 mpg; per-possession, that's a slightly better version of what he did for the next four years, earning himself all-NBA teams."
And? Thats like giving Paul Millsap the 2015 MVP dummy
I love how he just casually shits on Paul Millsap
"Tbf the Hawks in 2015 had Paul Millsap as their leading scorer, they just played really good team ball that year with no superstar."
"On a related note, Paul Millsap? That Hawks team aint too flashy no"
"How can everyone on the Nuggets be so bad at defense when the Nuggets are so good at defense?   Jokic bad. MPJ bad. Campazzo annoying but bad. Barton (was) bad. Murray (was) bad. Morris (was) bad.   AG I guess? Makes sense. He's so good he carried their defense before he even got to the team. Lol. It's getting pretty tired that just because they don't have a flashy defensive scheme Nuggets players can't play D.   Y'all know MPJ is doing better than Jamychal Green and Paul Millsap on defense, right? Hes honestly been comparable to AG. Idk what exactly that says about either of them, but aside from MPJ having a little more of his strengths in help defense and AG having a little more of his 1 on 1.... They're very comparable. Above average switchable forwards with length but limited lateral quickness. Good but not great (yet)."
^ dude who's literally calling Paul Millsap daddy
"the Suns have a lot more high level talent than that Hawks team, Booker + Paul + Ayton is better on paper than Millsap + Teague + Horford"
Paul Millsap played most of the season unlike 2018. Guess he was the MVP.
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."
why would the raptors trade siakam for gary harris and paul millsap? even if they get a few first round picks they're likely to be late 20s and the raptors might as well keep siakam.
"Paul Millsap coming off the bench has been great lately. Jokic and MPJ are starting to develop a nice two man game, too."
Paul millsap has the best job in the world
"Yeah, and he was going against 50+ win teams in the first round. Who do you think is bigger competition? Dirk Nowitzki or Paul Millsap?"
I said what up to Facu at Safeway the other day. Boy was I embarrassed when it turned out to be Paul Millsap  ETA: absolutely LOVE your username
Ya if we were talking about the Warriors best player (Andrew Wiggins) and Kyrie then that would be interesting. MVP ranking right now is:   1) Cam Johnson (18 RPPG)  2) Kyrie   3) Wiggins  4) Jae Crowder  5) Theo Maledon  6) Paul Millsap
"The Grizzlies were keeping up pretty well but just looked like they got so tired in the second half. I don’t blame them — last night was the last game of a 7 game/11 day road trip for them. When these two teams played each other at the beginning of the Grizzlies road trip the game was much closer, going into double overtime with Denver winning by 2 points. Ja Morant has some amazing moves for finishing at the rim. Brandon Clarke looked good on defense.  The obvious things to point out about the Nuggets are how amazing Jokic is, and MPJ’s awakening. Mpj scored 31 last night after getting a new career high 39 points in their last game vs the Rockets. Last night Paul Millsap was the man. Looking at the box score he’s only credited for one steal but he definitely had a hand in at least one other one. He was also hitting some pretty clutch shots. Jokic had a full court pass to Austin Rivers for an easy two points. Aaron Gordon has been a revelation. He’s thriving on this team.   MPJ’s younger brother Jontay is on the Grizzlies. He got put in at the very end for the last 4 or 5min. But J Porter was fouled on a 3pt shot and made all 3 freethrows. MPJ was smiling at him from the bench. It was a sweet moment.  Next play Bol Bol got fouled. Made both his freethrows. The crowd was chanting MVP, lol. He also had a crazy dunk to end the game. His teammates and the crowd were loving it."
Are we really gonna act like prime Paul millsap was some bum
Does adding a two-time MVP and a DPOY make a team better than starting 17/8/3 Paul Millsap?  &amp;#x200B;  I dunno.
"Bol Bol, Paul Millsap, and Vlatko Cancar."
I mean we talking current Paul Millsap or prime? Cause i could see an argument for prime Paul over sheed
"Nah bro it's LeBron, Jokic been getting the Mickey Mouse wins. Nuggets better without ballhog murray, and Jokic getting carried by my man Paul Millsap. Meanwhile LeBron is still LeWilling this Lakers team to Dubs even without being on the court. #LeGOAT."

Paul Millsap
"They lost grant and plumlee which were massive losses during the off season. Paul Millsap got a year older and is starting to look past his time (he actually was really important for them last season.  I would say going into this season, they were absolutely getting a bit weaker. They still have a young core however, so you could argue the experience counteracts that."
"2014-2015 hawks. Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, and Jeff Teague. No real superstar though."
"And who did jokic have? Jamal Murray, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, MPJ. Jamal mUrray is the perfect guard to go alongside jokic. KAT's best teammate ever was andrew wiggins. Twolves have failed to build around towns, which is why we have only made the playoffs once."
"Duncan Robinson, Gary Payton II, Dean Wade, Seth Curry, Paul Millsap, George Hill, Mike Miller, Allen Crabbe, Thanasis Antetounkumpo, and...MEYERS LEONARD!"
Paul Millsap as a late show band leader!  Norman Powell as Franciscan Friar!  Wow this is fun
"Jokic with Porter of 20, with too slow veteran Millsap of 36 and with Myrray of 23 plus a couple of solid role players knocked out a super team of mercenary Clippers who have 10 good players and 2 stars. He was for one stupid mistake by Mason on a very tense series with Lebron, Davis + 2 future HOF + 5-6 good role players. Are you saying that Kobe and Paul are better than Lebron-Davis plus 2 other future HOF players? Jokic finished second in the table below the prime Warriors. Jokic never lost in the first round. Jokic's playoff statistics are cosmically better than his when it comes about efficiency. Malo has only 31% for 3 pts and 41% fg. Jokic is another level.   Not to mantion that is this era much more stronger than that era. Mehmet Okur was All Star with 17/7/1"
Booker is closer to being a superstar than Derozan/Paul Millsap. He isn't a top 5 player for sure but he at least has the ability to take over a game at times like the actual top players are capable of
"This is what people living in markets like boston, NY, LA, or Chicago don't realize: Small market teams have to overpay the players that they draft and develop because they'll go sign somewhere else if they don't. And on top of that, you can't count on any good free agents signing with your team. The Nuggets' best FA signing of the past decade has been Paul Millsap. Small market teams can't just count on being able to land quality free agents year in and year out, so they have to be willing to sign the players they draft for more than they're worth just so they'll stick around"
"Well the supporting cast has been incredibly weak. Statistically there is really no argument to be made — Jokic leads in almost every advanced statistical category. The nuggets were finally healthy and no longer playing Paul Millsap. They were definitely going on a run. Murray going down is going to sink this team record wise some, but that’s not on Jokic. The guy has more offensive win shares than anyone else has total win shares, and has crossed the .300 WS/48 mark that only all time greats get to occasionally."
"It's still definitely shifted in perspective.    For example, at the start of Paul Millsap's career, he was considered a scrappy tweener.  He was a good enough rebounder, but people didn't expect much from him due to his size.    Utah traded Deron Williams for Derrick Favors because Favors had the ""ideal power forward"" frame, who we developed for years to replace Paul Millsap.  Meanwhile, in 2021, Paul Millsap is now considered to be the ideal Power Forward, and Derrick Favors has become an outdated concept for a power forward and was made into a center."
Woo Paul Millsap!
I very much did. Randle got a foul called on Paul Millsap who barely even grazed him. Burks also dived across the hardwood after barely making any contact with Harden to draw a foul.
Because Paul Millsap was clutch for the Knicks keeping the game close
paul millsap is absolutely cooked
"Paul Millsap was barely getting minutes at the start of the season, so my guess is that Nash is giving Millsap minutes to prove himself. He’s the first one at risk of getting cut though."
Someone get Paul Millsap a life alert
Paul Millsap is so ass
"Nah I don't like that narrative. ""11-9 in a weaker Eastern Conference"" but let's look at their L's in that period.   They lost to the Boston Celtics twice who were 2nd in defense that season along with maintaining their big 3 core. Paul ""Shitting don't make sense"" Pierce was still leading his team to a 56-26 record.  They lost to the Hornets who were spearheaded by prime CP3 and had 6 scorers averaging in the double digits while also being in the top 10 defenses.  They lost to the Utah Jazz who had the interior dominant presence of Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson along with a prime D. Will and the jackknife defender AK47.   They then lost to the bully ball Memphis Grizzlies with ZBO and Marc with Rudy Gay being the up and coming 20 point scorer. Not to mention they had Mike Conley and Tony Allen which made them a perimeter nightmare.  After the rodeo in the west they came back east where they got beaten by a Pacers team with a prime Danny Granger, the chonkosaurus defensive presence of Roy Hibbert, and the consistent backcourt of Collison and Dunleavy.   Then they lose to the big daddy Dwight Howard team who would go on to have a record of 52-30. They had 9 players that season averaging double digits and Dwight was still in his dominant prime.  And finally, they lose to Dirk ""The Mullet"" Nowitzki. Their team wasn't just top 8 in both defensive and offensive rating, but they had Jason ""Wife Beater"" Kidd along with Terry, Marion, Butler bringing up the rear.   That '11 Heat team wasn't losing to scrubs and more importantly, they won the match ups that were clearly in their favor. This Lakers team has been losing to random people and a situation where you have Westbrook, AD, and Lebron and LOSE to a Kings team should never occur."
Nuggets biggest ever FA was a washed Paul millsap lmao   Bozos on here say anything without knowing anything
"Nah, they pretty much had whatever they wanted against those two and they were not making even similar offensive output like Jokic. Surround Jokic with quality teammates and watch him go back to back, he's that good.   He's that good that people expect him to win chips with Campazzo, Austin Rivers and corpse of Paul Millsap as his starters."
"""Flashbacks to Paul Millsap"""
"Kanter and Sabonis remind me of Zeebo, even Sengun a little bit. Gritty, unathletic, skilled back to the basket big man with a good mid range jumper and a low centre of gravity.   Rasheed is difficult, if you're looking at role and counting stats I'd say Montrezl Harrell, if you're looking at build and playstyle I'd say Marcus Morris, maybe a younger Paul Millsap."
"Definitely feelin’ the Julius Randle - Z-Bo comparison although Julius is more perimeter oriented with a better handle and playmaking. Z-bo’s footwork/positioning, low-to-mid-post game was top notch. Maybe someone like prime Paul Millsap?   Sheed is a harder comparison… maybe Al Horford? Or someone like prime Serge Ibaka with way less blocks and a much more refined post game? Hard to find players with Sheed’s offensive low post skills, ability to stretch the floor, AND provide All-NBA level defense and major swagger… loved Sheed! He was always a top level talent that gave zero f*@ks about how you viewed him. Was definitely the x-factor/missing piece on that awesome 2004 Detroit Piston Championship team."
I'm talking about how r/nba acted like we were the 17 Warriors 2.0 when we got Blake Griffin and Paul Millsap lmao
Paul Millsap
Oh yeah Paul Millsap is now a Net.
John Stockton's 3 point buzzer beater over the Rockets to send the Jazz to the NBA Finals.  Honorable mention: The Miracle in Miami. Paul Millsap went Super Nova.
"Utah Jazz following Stockton &amp; Malone. Kirilenko was a complete surprise from a talent standpoint and immediate contributor. Then they tanked one season and got Deron Williams, other than that all of their acquisitions of talent were great finds. They got Mehmet Okur a future all star off a deep Pistons team, he went on to be great in Utah. They snagged Boozer (shadily I might add) early in his career and he blossomed into a 2x all star in Utah. Underrated FA signings like Korver and deep draft picks like Paul Millsap and CJ Miles made the Jazz rebuild effortless and they were a fringe contender from 07-10 despite only one tanking season."
"Jazz rebuilding their team after Stockton and Malone to get to the 2007 WCF is a pretty interesting one to me. Not the most fascinating for sure, but for the Jazz to rebuild well after losing their two long-time franchise cornerstones in Stockton and Malone to become a consistent playoff team after just a few seasons of issues is a pretty strongly-done rebuild. And to rebuild into a WCF team just two seasons after their worst record as a franchise is impressive.  The Jazz were 26-56 in 2004-05 (first losing season since the 80s), but were able to improve to 51-31 in 2006-07 and won their division. Pretty quick turnaround.  Carlos Boozer: signed via free agency (through offer sheet) from Cleveland prior to the 2004-05 season  Mehmet Okur: signed via free agency from the Detroit Pistons prior to the 2004-05 season  Deron Williams: drafted by the Jazz with the 3rd overall pick in the 2005 draft (which the Jazz got through their bad 2004-05 season).   Matt Harpring: signed via free agency from the Orlando Magic prior to the 2002-03 season (holdover from prior to 2004-05)  Derek Fisher: acquired via trade with Golden State Warriors prior to 2006-07 season. The Warriors in return received Keith McLeod, Andre Owens, and Devin Brown from the Jazz.  Andrei Kirelinko: drafted by the Jazz with the 24th overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft. Joined the Jazz for the 2001-02 season.  Gordan Giricek: acquired via trade with the Orlando Magic during the 2003-04 season. The Magic received DeShawn Stevenson and a future second-round pick.  Paul Millsap: drafted by the Jazz with the 47th overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.  Ronnie Brewer (started 14 games for the Jazz as a rookie in 2006-07): drafted by the Jazz with the 14th overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.  It was a pretty unique rebuild given two of their key players were obtained through free agency (Boozer and Okur), when you would normally expect small-market teams to draft their franchise cornerstones. Of course the Jazz going a surprising 42-40 without Stockton and Malone in 2003-04 likely helped their case in obtaining Boozer for 2004-05.   The Jazz would remain to be a consistent playoff team up to the 2010-11 season, when the whole Jerry Sloan and Deron Williams situation went down during the season and the Jazz missed the playoffs."
Paul Millsap  Malcolm Brogdon
"Their postgame thread is pretty salty too. ""Injury-riddled Nets"", as if we weren't missing Klay Thompson (multi-year All-Star, top 5 shooter all-time, all-NBA defender) and James Wiseman (#2 overall pick, and literally 50% of our center presence). That easily outweights Joe Harris, Paul Millsap, and Nic Claxton. Unless you're counting Kyrie, but he's not out due to injury. He's out due to being a woke idiot, which their front office knew full well when they signed him."
"Former Hawks:  PG: Dennis Schroeder  SG: Tim Hardaway Jr.  SF: Paul Millsap  PF: Mike Muscala  C: Al Horford  Bench: Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, DeAndre Bembry, Taurean Prince, Dwight Howard, Dewayne Dedmon  Thank goodness for Trae."
"after being a life long Nuggets fan the first game I went to was when Luka/Jokic traded game winning buckets.  It was awesome to see both, but it just *had* to be a Paul Millsap game... I wanted someone else to tear it up lol"
"The nuggets are considered stacked? Because Murray isn't seen as a defensive player. Prior to Aaron Gordon they had an aged Paul Millsap. Gary Harris was a solid 2 for defense, but Barton isn't. KAT has had guys specifically tailored for defensive roles alongside him, but they turn in shitty defense year after year."
"People talk about a ""downsizing"" in the league, but that has primarily occurred at the 4, not the 5. Most traditional power forwards have now either shifted to center if they are big enough (plus some guys just get older and slower and sort of ""age into"" the position), and/or expand out to the three-point line. Kevin Love and Paul Millsap starting shooting threes. Lamarcus Aldridge and Al Horford are centers now. AD slides between the 4 and 5. Ibaka went from regular PF to stretch center. A lot of 4's now are just big wings. Mmmm, big wings."
Patty Mills  Bruce Brown  DeAndre Bembry  Paul Millsap  Lamarcus Aldridge
"Kyle Korever, Paul Millsap, Al Horford"
"Patty Mills, Jevon Carter, DeAndre Bembry, Paul Millsap and LaMarcus Aldridge.. pretty bad. Usually LMA is carrying that unit but he was off tonight."
"Paul Millsap, Blake Griffin, and Aldridge are all pretty damn washed at this point"
"Denver’s biggest FA signing is Paul Millsap. Think about that for a moment - a 33 year old Millsap was their largest FA signing in *franchise history.* They are never going to attract any stars, and no one has shown willingness to come here even with the possibility of playing with Jokic. The Nuggets paid MPJ because he was already one of the best shooters in the league for an extended amount of time during the regular season. He’s got a lot of potential on both ends of the floor - for teams like Denver that cannot just simply walk into talent unlike other teams, there’s no other option.  It’s not an albatross when you can’t even use that money in free agency to lure any stars that even want to come here. And you can lock the guy down long term unlike trading for an expiring contract on a star that will probably bolt as soon as their contract is over.   MPJ offers a skillset that is very similar to KD with how tall he is and how good of a shooter he is. He didn’t start the season well, but that doesn’t invalidate the excellent season he had last year. And he showed a lot of improvement everywhere else this year - the shooting will come, so the Nuggets aren’t worried about that at all."
Remember when Paul Millsap was on the Jazz and he dropped 25 threes on the Heat?
best bad player - maybe Paul Millsap. I mean there are plays up and down the floor and he doesn't look like he knows what city he's in.  Then he'll turn on the jets a bit and finish his last two minutes strong.
"Paul Millsap looks a little heavier than he used to, but he’s not even close to as big as Zion"
"Bud would’ve stuck him on the bench behind Paul Millsap and had him spotting up for corner threes…they weren’t ready for each other back then. Honestly don’t know if Giannis becomes Giannis if he joins the Hawks in 2013, he got a lot of playing time *right* away in Milwaukee which had a lot to do with it."
Paul Millsap has absolutely not ever led the league in steals lmao.
Paul Millsap led the league in steals 3 times. Sengun's steals reminds me of his a bit.
"In 2013. That’s eight years ago. And I specifically mentioned that in my comment “discrediting them”. They’ve not deserved to or been close to making an All Star team at any point during their Bucks tenure. Paul Millsap made more teams more recently than them, are you counting him as a star teammate for Jokic?  If the cast that showed up for those two games against the Hawks had played that well the entire run we’d have strolled the playoffs, but you know as well as I do that didn’t happen. But if you want to talk that Nets game 7, for all their “moments” Jrue and Middleton went 14/49 in that game. They were shit. Don’t pick and choose."
"Jokic’s defense is not elite, people really need to stop kidding themselves with this stuff.  Last year Denver was the worst team in the league at protecting the rim and was 7 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Jokic on the bench. He’s the best offensive player in the league, but he lowers his teams defensive ceiling by a good margin.   He gets a lot of rebounds and steals so his defensive numbers may look good on metrics like DBPM, but building a defense around Jokic good enough to actually win a title is extremely difficult. Even with the best 3pt% against in 2019 and Paul Millsap playing excellent defense at the 4 the Nuggets could only get up to 10th in defensive rating, and that’s the best they’ve been in the Jokic era. That’s the bare minimum needed to win a title and with the money the Nuggets are paying to Jokic, Murray and Porter Jr.  I personally don’t think they’ll get up there again."
"I'm riding with Miami this year, I just love them getting Lowry and Tucker, 2 NBA champs, 2 incredibly smart basketball players, 2 tough motherfuckers who fit Heat culture to a tee.   The basketball gods clearly reward you for doing shit like that. Bucks won the title after going all in for Jrue and Tucker, Suns made the Finals after acquiring CP3 and Crowder, Lakers won it all after getting AD and Danny Green, Miami got Jimmy and Crowder, the Raptors got Kawhi and Danny Green etc.  Also I'm never going to buy the Nets as long as their best defensive player is... 36-year old Paul Millsap? Nic Claxton? When is the last team that a team won a championship without a great defensive player? 2016 Cavs are probably the weakest but even then LeBron is a much better defensive player than anybody currently on this Nets team.  The last 3 NBA champions won it all off the back of their defense.      As for the Bucks, I think they are quite clearly the best team in the league when fully healthy, I'm just skeptical they'll remain fully healthy, Jrue has a history of injuries and just played an incredibly long season and is already out, Brook is old and is already missing time, plus it's just hard to defend your title, Lakers found that out last year."
"agreed, washington fans on here love them some john wall, couldn't beat a Paul Millsap lead hawks team"
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
"Just to highlight how long ago 5 years is, 5 years ago, the following players played in the All Star Game: Isaiah Thomas, John Wall, Kevin Love, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan.  Those guys have had varying degrees of success since then, and contribute to winning, but when was the last time anyone thought of any of those guys as stars?"
"Irving, James Harden, Durant, Blake Griffin, Paul Millsap, Patty Mills, Aldridge. I can’t remember anyone else :/"
PLAYER	TEAM	AGE  Andre Iguodala	GSW	37  Carmelo Anthony	LAL	37  Chris Paul	PHX	36  LaMarcus Aldridge	BKN	36  LeBron James	LAL	36  P.J. Tucker	MIA	36  Paul Millsap	BKN	36  Al Horford	BOS	35
Never forget the bubble scrims where the Denver Nuggets starting 5 looked like this:   PG: 7'0 Joker SG: 6'8 Jerami Grant SF: 7'2 Bol Bol PF: 6'7 Paul Millsap  C: 6'11 Mason Plumlee
"2011-2012: Raja Bell, Devon Harris, Gordylox Hazelwood, Paul Millsap, and Al Jefferson.  2021-2022: Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal, Rudy Gobert.  I've got my money on current team, but I would love to see Big Al post up against Rudy."
current jazz vs:  devin harris  paul millsap  al jefferson  gordon hayward  raja bell    2021 jazz would smoke this team
paul millsap to
LA &amp; Paul Millsap need to kick back....LA kind of has an excuse but Paul is soggy and washed up
they really thought they could replace Jeff green with Paul Millsap
Absolutely love the fact the Nets replaced Jeff Green with fucking Paul Millsap lmao
Remember when Paul Millsap fleeced a 4 year max deal?
"casually bringing Patty Mills, Paul Millsap and Lamarcus Aldridge off the bench is kinda wild"
Adding patty mills and Paul millsap is huge
"For real. We have:   Kevin Durant, James harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap. That’s insane already"
I’m sorry but Giannis is dusting a 37 year old Paul Millsap

are you sure that is true? Doesnt it seem like older guys get contact injuries they didnt when they were younger? Maybe a step slower means contact when there would not have been any or it would have hit differently before. Or maybe I just watched Paul Millsap have a bunch of freak contact injuries for a couple years after being really healthy his whole career
"I'm sure he'll be fine when he's coaching KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Blake, Paul Millsap and Joe Harris"
"And the 2016 Cavs beat the Andre Drummond Pistons, Paul Millsap Hawks, and the Raptors again in the east lol"
"Big cost of depth??? Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, Paul Millsap--I think they recovered that depth just fine"
"I don’t think he can play the 5 defensively.  That requires help defense and rim protection which isn’t his specialty.  He’s a great on ball guy which is good for the Nets switching system but if teams are hunting the mismatch (Harden), then Ben is basically being wasted in terms of his talents.  Ben is great because he’s the best guy his size at getting through screens putting him in a system that doesn’t require that minimizes that one special trait he has.  It’s why him and Embiid worked so well.  Joel protected the rim and Ben fought through screens.  On offense the Nets don’t really have enough 2 way shooters to play him at the 5.  Sure in theory you can have Patty, Harden, Joe, KD, and Ben but while that works on offense for you that actually hurts your defense not being able to play a Paul Millsap or Blake Griffin as well in the situations.  Guys who can switch but also help protect the rim somewhat.  It’s one of those good on paper until you break it down moves."
Teams would just dare Ben Simmons to beat them because Brooklyn doesn’t have a reliable enough stretch five with Jeff Green gone.  It’s either Ben Simmons beat us or Blake/LMA/Paul Millsap beat us with jumpers.  With Kyrie you don’t have that luxury especially if Joe Harris plays like he did in the Milwaukee.
"Lowry, Butler, Chauncey, Ben Wallace, Julius Randle, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap   Bunch more."
Paul Millsap
Paul Millsap was and is a outstanding talent. He didn't get a Max contract at that age because he was bad. Korver is one of the best shooters in the league's history. They both had a stand out season.
"Vuc is an all star in the same way Paul Millsap and Kyle Korver were all stars.., only cause of a trash conference"
BROOKLYN NETS INJURY REPORT  Blake Griffin - Questionable (Knee) James Harden - Probable (Hamstring) Kyrie Irving - Out (Jail) Paul Millsap - Out (Leg)
"That's the problem with the NBAPA, they fight for their stars harder than rank and file members. If Paul Millsap was the one refusing the vaccine and the Nets threatened to only play him half of his 2 million dollar salary,  the NBAPA wouldn't give a crap and will probably use back channels to force Millsap into compliance. But Kyrie refuses and they are willing to die on this hill."
"Bosh is the most overrated player in the last 20 years. 1 All NBA selection but he was able to rack up All Star games in a super weak East where he was competing with old Kevin Garnett, Paul Millsap, Roy Hibbert and Rashard Lewis for all star spots. If he plays in the West he probably has 2-3 all star games, no way he's making the ASG averaging 16 &amp; 6 over Dirk, Duncan, Amar'e, Boozer, Pau, Blake, Love, West, Durant, Melo, Marion etc...  No way is Bosh better than Wilkins or a top 75 player imo."

"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
"It's so weird having Paul Millsap, Aldridge, and Blake Griffin on the team."
Paul Millsap gotta get a well
TIL Paul Millsap is a fish that can survive on sea water
Wait until he learns that people are also made of ~50-75%  water.  Paul Millsap is made of [~60% water](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-percentage-of-the-human-body-is-water#percentage-chart) and still gets a water bill.  I bet he will wish he had webbed feet to go with that [bill](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a7/f5/3d/a7f53d776d9ad4682bdbf9a9f7927b57.jpg).
"&gt;“We’ve got a fairly quiet group. Most of the guys are to themselves; they stay in their own little shells. It’ll be nice to get them out, open up a little bit, even myself. &gt;  &gt; “I’m not that loud, but … I’m more loud than anybody on this team, like Paul [Millsap], LaMarcus [Aldridge], Patty [Mills], [Kevin Durant], you’ve got a lot of guys who are just to themselves. So it’s my job to open them up a little bit”.   Exactly how I imaged the Nets"
Paul Millsap with a damning critique of capitalism
"I really want everything you say about Butler to be true, but I think calling him a top-5 draft steal of the decade is kind of pushing it when this decade also has players like Rudy Gobert (27), Draymond Green (35), Jimmy Butler (30), Nikola Jokic (41), Malcolm Brogdon (36) and Pascal Siakam (27). That's five all-stars, four of whom are on a trajectory to being in the Hall of Fame, and a *very good* starting PG in Brogdon who is right on the cusp of being like a 15th or 14th all-star in a weaker conference.   I really want Butler to be that good, and I think he definitely *can* be, it's clear he's extremely talented, but I also think that saying he's ""already"" a top 5 draft steal of the decade is **very** premature, especially when you consider that we haven't even seen the first few years of guys who were drafted late in the 1st or mid into the 2nd round in the last couple of years. There might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now, and making a comparison with Butler to those guys who haven't had much of a chance to emerge is somewhat of a leap imho."
because only 3% of it is freshwater Paul Millsap
Hillbilly Kobe and THT vs Paul Millsap and Cam Thomas baby!
"You are obsessed with the idea that you are a better person than me that you don't actually bother caring what I said. When I went from not caring all that much about sports, to wanting to really get into sports, the Falcons had a soul crushing loss in the super bowl. I felt the heartbreak of loss, and didn't want to pick up the sport. Instead I only focused on Basketball, and the Hawks.  Not to mention. I AM A HAWKS FAN. You realize that since 2016-17 we haven't been the team that's been lighting the league up, night in night out. The 60 win team was the year prior, and the team immediately began making moves that didn't make us objectively better. 16-17 was the beginning of the journey to our rebuild. I didn't pick the Hawks for Wins, I liked Kyle Korver Shooting threes, the Hype of Sir Foster, I liked watching Paul Millsap be one of the best players in the league, without getting the recognition I thought he deserved. I defended Dennis Schroeder to the ends of the earth. Saying he could be our point gaurd of the future. I watched Taurean Prince describe how to rebound a thousand times because it was legitimately hilarious. It wasn't about picking a winning team, it was about vibe when I wanted to start following a sport.  But Nah King, here is your 👑, And your 🔑 to keep the gates nice and locked up."
"Great point about Blake and LMA damn. No team can run with 100% healthy Kyrie/Harden/KD/Blake/LMA with Joe Harris sixth man, plus Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Paul Millsap off the bench. Cam Thomas looks good too"
"If ""good health"" includes mental health/emotional stability then I agree.  By the way, apart from the obvious, a good health guarantee on Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap would be a big deal."
THE HARDEST ROAD- PAUL MILLSAP!
"Derrick White booming on Paul Millsap, and Malcolm Brogdon killing Bron and Kyrie in the same game is up there for sure 😂😂"
Paul Millsap got me.
"Hakeem, Shaq, Payton, Kemp, Malone, Stockton, Robinson, Drexler, Barkley, Miller, Hardaway, Mourning, and I’m just getting started.   Maybe overall talent wise the league was watered down, but the HOFs were incredible and MJ played way more teams with elite talent in the East than Lebron ever had to. Beating Lowry and Derozan and Paul Millsap pales in comparison to beating Miller and Shaq."
Texting while driving? Shame on you Paul Millsap
"So I was never a big fan of basketball. People would talk about Giannis in my school since I live in Wisconsin so I was kinda interested,but never too intrigued. But when I went on a skiing trip to Colorado months later, I was at a bar and the Nuggets game was playing, I watched Paul Millsap score 30 on the Spurs and thought that maybe basketball was kinda cool. I continued to watch in Colorado and I began my deep dive into NBA and Basketball knowledge soon after. All thanks to Paul Millsap."
"I'm as pro athlete as they come, but man some of these dudes are straight dumb lol.  Paul Millsap really thinks he's being clever. What the fuck is ""I'll contest to that"" mean?  Obligatory fuck you to all those that used to come on here and r/nfl commenting ""translation please!!!"" but damn sometimes an athlete really says the dumbest shit"
Honestly not since the Last Dance Bulls did I see a regular season team get so much attention.  People would actively hate watch the 2010 Heat in the regular season and clown them when they saw them start 9-8 and Paul Millsap drop 40 points on their head.
Paul Silas  Paul Pierce  Paul Pressey  Paul George  Paul Millsap
"&gt;Jokic just got Aaron Gordon this year and Gary Harris has been washed the last 3 years. Talent wise they are similiar but lets not act like KAT didnt play with some solid players. Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.   He had Paul Millsap who was very good until last year and the perfect partner for him in the frontcourt and Gary was good 2 years ago and okay 1 year ago certainly not bad players.  &gt;Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.  HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM PLAY IN MINNESOTA? BAD DEFENCE,NO REBOUNDING,DIDN'T PASS,SCORED 20 PPG ON 54% TS. THERE IS A REASON ONLY KAT IS ON THE ROSTER STILL FROM THOSE TEAMS"
Yeah because people wanna see al horford and Paul millsap on Christmas
"I’d take him but I think if you can get Paul Millsap, you go after him."
"Paul ""Bitch Slap"" Millsap onced saved my torpedoed fantasy squad one season. I'll never forget about him 👍🏾 This is a lame poll , I remember cats from the 80s like it was yesterday, no pun intended.  Lots of these guys put up numbers. All of em actually."
"&gt;	Stars of today  &gt;	Al Horford, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul Millsap  Think you scuffed that one buddy"
Paul millsap come on down
"Horford, Wall, Cousins and Millsap don’t belong to this conversation.   Btw my take is… Paul George. Yes. PAUL GEORGE."
&gt;stars of today  &gt;Paul Millsap
"I don’t think anyone will ever forget Carmelo, he’s in the Harden/Westbrook/Barkley tier.   Paul George  John wall  Bradley Beal  Cousins  Horford  Butler  Millsap  Oladipo  There’s a lot of players who aren’t gonna be heavily remembered in 15yrs."
"Even if the Bucks didn’t win, Bud gets fired, he would have landed another job somewhere.  Two reasons: 1) He got a 60-win season out of a Hawks team led by Paul Millsap as their best player. 2) He turned the Bucks franchise around…even if you wanna credit Kidd for starting it.  One of the bottom 10 teams would have given Bud a chance to rebuild them just like he did in Atlanta and Milwaukee."
That's what it was. [Here's a piece on his original 2017 signing](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2017/7/2/15912340/5-things-to-know-about-paul-millsap-denver-nuggets) which mentions that he spent 10 years of his childhood in Denver.
"Paul ""Trillsap"" Millsap has yet to be signed should've been the title"
This man got a job before Paul millsap.
"He was on a superteam against teams whos best players were Lowry and Derozan, Isiah Thomas, Drose as the only star, Old Drose and young Jimmy, Paul Millsap, etc etc. The only tough teams he beat in that reign were the 2012 Celtics and the Paul George Pacers. There were almost no first team all nba players in the east other than Lebron that entire time."
"Lol Wes Matthews can do both, he’s a no brainer. And Dudley likely coming back so that leaves one spot. I’d love to get Paul Millsap as a bench stretch 4/5, think he can be a sneaky good addition."
I would like to have Paul Millsap off the bench
Paul millsap is a perfect veteran PF
"Add to that list Marc Gasol, Paul Millsap, Cliff Robinson, Dragic, Jeff Hornacek, Doc Rivers  Anthony Mason was a third round pick in 1988, picked 53rd (would have been 2nd round today given size of league)."
"Hawks signed Johnny Hamilton as 15th man..  Couldve retained Nathan Knight (who is genuinely awesome) snagged Omer Yurtseven, or pursued Paul Millsap/Isaiah Hartenstein  Dare I say it but this was Travis Schlenk's only misstep this offseason"
"I'm not that high on Barnes. I think that Toronto just made the mistake that Orlando's been making for years becoming enamored with the long athletic tweener forward (fluctuating between the 3 and the 4) types because in theory they do so much. In practice who fits that description and is an all star level guy? Kawhi and Tatum, there's a tier difference between those 2 and then Pascal Siakam, and then theres another drop off in that archetype of player down to Tobias Harris, maybe a time ago Carmelo Anthony and Paul Millsap? I leave LeBron and KD off here (and I really dont feel comfortable with Tatum being in this category either) because they were uber skilled players before they were switchable defensive pieces. They're just so talented and uniquely built that you put them on the floor and build a lineup around them and if they end up the 4 instead of the 3 then youre not mad about it because they're the best player on the floor 90% of the time anyways.  Whereas I feel like over the last 20 years the high energy and high IQ  point guard has been a consistent floor raising guy that you always see on playoff teams. Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Jrue had some bad teams in New Orleans but him too. Go back a decade or more and throw guys like Tony Parker and prime Kidd on there too.  Idk i felt this since draft night I feel like Toronto outsmarted themselves with Barnes. He may end up being a good player and long switchable wings definitely don't grow on trees. I also may end up entirely wrong but I feel like we've talked ourselves into the archetype of Barnes in the mid/high lottery before and it ended up being a stinker pick."
Better call Paul ^^^Millsap
"Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Draymond Green, Danilo Gallinari."
Dude looks like Paul Millsap
"This would be a great signing for the Suns, but I think we’re trying to focus on Paul Millsap. Garrison is probably better than Nader, but not a big enough upgrade to miss out on a better backup 4"
Robert horry would know anything about the clippers. Literally works for lakers cable channel. He is just trying to cause drama where there is none.  Ad took two weeks to re-sign.   Who is kawhi waiting for Paul Millsap. Lauri Franky smokes. .
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
Paul Millsap and Kelly Oubre. Are you fucking kidding me
"It happened to Paul Millsap in Denver. He had a 30 million team option during the 19-20  season and he wasn’t worth anything close to that. But, because the Nuggets were limited by the cap and couldn’t sign a decent PF with their remaining cap space, they had to pick up Millsap’s third year option even though it was egregious. If the suns are pressed up against the cap, they’ll have to keep CP3, to play or as possible filler for a trade."

Could be a poor mans Paul Millsap
"Sorry I was busy with stuff.  Beal was obviously their prime target, but apparently he doesn't want out. If that's the case, they should probably engage Toronto on the Siakam front, or they maybe should've even kicked the tires on Derozan (who graded out by Bball Index's LEBRON metric as a better overall player than Wiggins last year).   Those are, of course, bigger signings, so if we look at smaller ones, what about Danny Green? Paul Millsap? Ben Mclemore? Victor Oladipo? Just guys who can come in and contribute more easily than others. Frankly I think they should've just traded Oubre earlier for something else, but that's a different story altogether.   The initial point of discussion I wanted to bring up was that I think the Warriors FO isn't doing right by Steph, and that they should really be cashing more chips in on winning now as opposed to threading the needle. At the very least, I personally think they should be erring more towards winning now. You guys might disagree, and of course who am I but a random guy who doesn't work in any NBA FO, and that's all fine. It's just my opinion."
"Same Defensive rating before and after Vooch trade. Thad young is a loss defensively on the interior absolutely. Our perimeter defense is miles better. Temple was injured often and was playing SIGNIFICANT minutes for us. Dude is too old to be heavy rotationally. WCJ was feasted on and gave career highs to a stretch of stars before being traded.   Theis/Thad are the big defensive losses, with FA still going and Lauri still in our pocket if we got someone like Khem Birch as a backup big/Sign for Paul Millsap or trade for Jarred Vanderbilt we will shore up our weakness on the interior for sure.  Pretty terrible take to assume we would automatically be worse on defense when our perimeter defense is overhauled completely and gives Vooch a huge upgrade as vooch is NOT a bad defender. He just cant defend the perimeter, because of our trash perimeter defense he was being forced to switch often.   If you keep Vooch in the paint hes actually an average defender."
"&gt;So I don't know wtf you are on about.  You named a bunch of players that had no reason to stay in Denver and were only there for 1 year. Trading for someone has no implication that that player is expected to stay there for any length of time.   If you're just bringing up whoever went to Denver and didn't leave until Denver didn't want them anymore, how about Paul Millsap.   &gt;The point is that American born, star players in the NBA almost almost bolt to the glamour markets.  Mutumbo's from the Congo, and Grant went to Detroit."

"When Paul Millsap used to play for the Jazz we would drink every time the announcers said “millsap”. Turns out, they NEVER call him Paul."
"This is pretty disingenuous nobody considered jeff teague, kyle korver (who was an injury replacement), paul millsap and Al Horford legitimate ""stars"" that year  That guy might be a russ hater idk but I dont see how two superstars being AD and LeBron (both who are imo top 10 players) along with russ who with his flaws is still a star player in this league   Its a superteam and I'm not afraid to admit that"
Wolves will probably get a jamychal green/Paul millsap type at best. I’d be happy with that.
I agree. But he needs to be paired with a 4 that can defend and stretch the floor. He needs Atlanta Hawks Paul Millsap next to him.
I kind of threw that in at the last second and that it was interesting parallel with Paul Millsap. Was more interested to see what people thought of the potential of a Garuba and Sengun frontcourt.
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
"I remember 2006 was regarded as a weak class very early. It turned out a number of guys who had respectable careers, though: Kyle Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rajon Rondo, J.J. Redick, and Paul Millsap come to mind. Not a standout class, but it turned out a bit better than people thought, and definitely better than 2000."
"I really don't get the jokic comp ngl, ppl dont realise that jokic is an mvp and an all time passer. I feel like a more accurate comp for him is minnesota klove/paul millsap good to great post scorer, can score in general, can be a good position defender (kid got feel), however not vertical or long enough to play the 5, and not permiter oriented enough to warrant full small ball."
Everyone was shocked Bennett was taken at number 1.  I can’t remember there being a bigger draft surprise.  He was never considered a sure fire prospect.  Just because a draft guy may have thought his floor was Paul Millsap doesn’t mean he was a can’t miss prospect lol.
You can find scouting reports saying Bennett's floor is Paul Millsap back in 2013.
Paul Millsap
"How was Bennett never predicted to be an all star? He was the first pick in the draft. That's the bare minimum for someone picked number one overall.  Quick Google and people were comparing him to Larry Johnson at the time. A former all star and all-nba second team. Another common comparison was Paul Millsap, a 4x all star."
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
"Yeah part of the value of AD is you can play an offensive center  He is like prime Paul Millsap and prime Kenneth Faried, in one player, if both of those guys were also way better. Perfect Jokic pairing"
"I don't know. I guess I just look at an over-pay for a fringe superstar a little differently, especially when the team is already good. I view those signings a lot like Paul Millsap, but I don't think overpaying for Millsap means Denver will someday reel in a big fish."
"When Murray was hurt and MPJ was out for COVID, Jokic was like the only player on the team. Was a rough start. And even right now, Paul Millsap, JaMychal Green, Facu Compazzo, and Gary Harris are all out. 2 of those guys are starters, the other 2 are important rotation pieces."
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEynxvIjhCg&amp;ab\_channel=HouseofHighlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEynxvIjhCg&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights)  2:00  dunk on atlanta hawks (paul millsap i guess)  why it's not a charging foul?
He's not bad but he's not very good either.  He doesn't go out of his way to exert energy to make a good defensive play.  He's a tad slow and when I say that he probably couldn't even guard Paul Millsap on a switch.  If he's not already close to being in a good position then he's out of the play.
"I keep seeing the ""nothing to gain from lying"" but this dude was on my team and I had to read his name four times before I realised we weren't talking about Paul. Attention is enough reason for some people, as is spite. Remember Jussie Smollett faking a hate crime for literally no logical reason.  I'm not saying that Millsap is lying, I obviously don't know what happened, but ""he had nothing to gain from lying"" is such a cop-out."
Will be interesting to see what happens. Wonder what Paul Millsap thinks
"I think he would've been a weird combo of Ben wallace meets Zion meets Lamar Odom meets Paul Millsap. Chuck wasn't a shooter but he wasn't a non shooter either. I wish distance shooting numbers were available from back then, he would've probably been historically great scorer around the basket. I dunno that he's underrated. Most people rate him as one of the best players if not the best that never won a championship. I mean the guy won a MVP in an excellent era. He had a very strong career and hmif you watch his highlights like he could do it all. He was a very complete player that could get whatever he wanted."
&gt;Also I believe Lebron still only has one win in Utah since like 2013  Paul Millsap approves
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
WHY WOULD PAUL MILLSAP A PLAYER THAT PLAYED FOR THE JAZZ AND EARNED MILLIONS LIE?   &amp;#x200B;  I BELIEVE HIS BROTHER   &amp;#x200B;  Jazz have been know to be rather crude to other kinds.
That was cuz Paul Millsap is also a GOATed Heat Killer Supreme.
Paul Millsap went from undersized tweener to ideal PF.  Dude learned to shoot and everything.
"Not ""young"" in the sense that they most likely aren't a developing prospect anymore. At 27 you should be more or less a finished product if you have been in the NBA for your whole career up to that point.  There are rare exceptions like Steve Nash, Kyle Lowry, and Paul Millsap who made huge leaps in their late 20s/early 30s."
"To me, not having Thabo for defense was a huge killer for them.  Also, I don’t hate on that Hawks roster. I love me some Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver (fuck Delly), and Al Horford (though I really hate Jeff Teague)."
"Melo's people of Utah! If Derrick Favors (who must have been part of the NJ package) was on the table I wonder what Utah was offering. In the off-season before the Jazz imploded Utah wouldn't presumably wanted to put Deron Williams and Melo on the floor together so Utah could maybe offer something including some combo of AK47 (expiring), Al Jefferson (not a great contract), or Paul Millsap (bargain contract). Nuggets probably had their eye on Millsap but were able to get a better deal out of NY.   If they Denver bitten though like if NY pulled out thinking they had him in free agency I wonder if the Jazz don't implode the same way after a loss against a Bulls team with half their old players. Could Utah keep Melo and Deron together in this hypothetical?"
"&gt; Jokic has never lost more than 40.   Quite literally not true. Won 33 games his first season. You discount Gallo for health reasons but don't recognize Eric Gordon's? Gordon was not very good with AD. Jrue is solid but always a bit overrated and if your third guy to prove how great of a cast he has is Evan Turner then you're failing something big.   If you go year by year AD didn't underacheive.    In year one he won 27 games with Gordon only playing 40 games and shooting an eye catching 40% from the field.     He went 34-48 in year two with trash Tyreke Evans and Eric Gordon who was a bit better but still not good. Jrue was solid but only played 34 games.     YEar three ran it back and won 45 games. Gordon regressed further again and shot 41% from the field and 38% from within the three point line. Again, the Eric Gordon he played with is not the same guy HArden played with. Again tho Jrue only played 40 games and Gordon played 60.    Year four he won 30 games where again he had little to no help and a wave on injuries. Tyreke played 25 games, Jrue played 65 (only started 23), AD played 61, Gordon played 45. This season was a straight up mess with injuries throughout the roster and some truly awful lineups.    Year five he won 34 games with Jrue, Davis and 17 games worth of Boogie. Solomon Hill had the second most minutes played on this team and Et'wan Moree had the fourth most. Team was not good by any stretch.    Year 6 he won 48 even with Boogie going down. That team was rolling pre injury and I don't think there's any way they don't get to 50-55 wins if he stays healthy. That's also the one Jrue year where he played 65+ games. This year AD led them to a victory against the trailblazers in an embarrassing series for lillard. Jrue and Rondo played huge roles on that team, but AD was clearly the best player.   Year 7 AD's cast was back to being crap (just Jrue as Randle was still a negative), he complained and asked for a trade. He played 56 games and the team won 33 games total. Jrue played 67 games.  With the execption of the Boogie year where AD almost won 50 games I don't see a single instance where Jokic hasn't had a better supporting cast. If we throw out Jokic's first season where he average 10/7/2 (I'm a nice guy) his other seasons where he had a higher win total he had a better supporting cast. His 40 win season was his weakest cast but I'll take Gallo, Harris, Barton, Chandler any day of the week over the pelicans cast.  After that he added Murray and Paul Millsap.    &gt;He is the best #2 since Pippen but as a #1 option there is no evidence his teams would be much more than lower seed playoff fodder.  I mean Pippen was for sure a top 10 player so I don't see your point. Pippen&gt;AD&gt;&gt;Jokic."
"Better defense is debatable. Gasol and AD do a bunch of heavy lifting on that end for the Lakers. Nuggets have Gary Harris and Paul Millsap? Most advanced numbers have it as a wash between the two. Both are primary creators on their teams and the Nuggets have a better offensive rating than the Lakers so, if anything, Jokic gets the slight nod there. Lakers do have the better record though, but not better than the Jazz and it's right in line with Embiid's Sixers."
Yeah he's shown himself to be a really capable switchable small ball center in some of the minutes he has played - i honestly would like to give him some runtime against the Nuggets to see what he can do against Jokic since he had an alright showing in the playoffs last year too. Definitely an intriguing guy who could grow into a Paul Millsap type if his shot starts to fall.
"And jokic runs the entire offense. He beats Embiid in basically every single advanced stat, and trounces him in the offense only ones. Like... offensive win shares and offensive bpm jokic is light years ahead.   Also, while Embiid is certainly the superior defender, no one ever mentions that he also plays with WAY better defenders. Simmons gets DPOY chatter also and is first team all nba and probably the most versatile defender in the league. Danny green and Harris are both above average defenders, abs Thybulle looks like a damn wrecking ball out there this year. Jokic has... Gary Harris sometimes. Jokic is regularly stuck defending a guard coming full speed with no one close to him AND the opposing center. He gets hung out to dry 2 on 1 constantly. Interestingly, on the rare occasion the nuggets play any perimeter defense, jokic looks extremely good. He looked close to dominant against the Lakers, routinely shutting down anything near the basket (other than AD lebron PnR, but that kicked Embiid's butt too).   I'm not saying jokic would be Embiid level defensively, he wouldn't. But it would be a much different conversation if jokic had elite defenders surrounding him and Embiid had the mpj sieve, ghost of Paul Millsap, out of position undersized will Barton, and Jamal Murray (who has improved but...) in front of him. The gap would narrow for sure"
"That’s mainly because of Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, and Gary Harris all being very good for them last year defensively."
Find a way to de-age Paul Millsap
"its about team composition. if you even put PJ Tucker next to Jokic he'd be fine but ancient Paul Millsap isn't gonna be enough to make up for his deficiencies. I think they're a real 1a, 1b situation"
"Paul Millsap and Al Horford were both top 25 players at the time, similar to Don and Gobert right now."
"Hawks didn't have anyone close to Donovan Mitchell on that squad. Their top pts per game player was Paul Millsap at 16 pts a game. Also, they played in a weak Eastern Conference. Jazz are doing this in the West."
"Top five picks have approximately a 1-in-3 chance of becoming all-stars.  Utah's last 3 ""top-5"" picks were Exum, Kanter, &amp; Deron William's. So their scouting &amp; development of elite talent is average.   However, their ability to scout--then draft &amp; develop--late lottery &amp; draft/undrafted talent, or G-league talent, has been very good.   Aside from players on their own roster in this category (O'Neale, Ingles, Niang, Oni), they are also responsible for bringing many other players into the league still currently on rosters, &amp; who've had mulit-season NBA careers through these channels through the Utah Jazz organization, including:   Gordon Hayward  Rodney Hood   Alec Burks  Trey Lyles  DeMarre Carroll   Rayjon Tucker  Wes Matthews   Tony Bradley  Raul Neto  Paul Millsap.  There are likely more still playing, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head."
"Same. Also had the following happen this week: Mitchell Robinson, Hayward sit out, Herro sit out, Deandre Jordan sit out, Deandre Hunter undergo surgery, Anthony Davis, and then picked up Paul Millsap Saturday night only for him to get hurt also.   Meanwhile the team I played against had 4/5 keeps play four games. Murray had 8 steals on game, Porzingis had 6 blocks... I have the absolute worst luck in fantasy. I think of the 8 weeks so fae I've had an advantage in players once by two guys and I've also been outnumbered anywhere between 7-14."
This is right after Alex Caruso took out Paul Millsap and the ESPN broadcast completely ignored it and completely ignored that Millsap never came back into the game
"Paul Millsap lol Watch Ginobili play, you'll see he was a completely different caliber of player than millsap"
"Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and maybe even Paul Millsap are probably all ahead of Manu? Jokic will definitely be best when all is said and done, but picking Manu is a little bit odd lol"
"Based on how often the announcers love to tell me that Lebron is 36 years old, you'd think they'd show some love to fellow 36 year old starter Paul Millsap. They could have even used Paul's absence as a way to shower more praise on Lebron's toughness! Really missed their opportunity! Lol fun game though and I do like that crew of RJ and Breen most of the time"
"Idk man that Nuggets bench is pretty good, they got:  Monte Morris  Facundo Campazzo  PJ Dozier  JaMychal Green  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if it's better defensively but efficiency wise they are (even tho they don't shoot at the volume the Knicks bench does), not to mention 11-15 they are by far the best in the NBA imo. I mean RJ Hampton, Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, are all getting minutes on most teams imo."
Are you comparing Paul Millsap to Anthony Davis?
"If five Paul Millsaps were to play against a team of LeBron and four snails, no one is clamoring to figure out which Millsap to give MVP to since they'd have the better team."
"-You’re saying Donovan Mitchell is no better than Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, or Al Horford? Really?  -That subpar wing defense held Giannis to 2 points and 3 FGA in the first half, and most of his points came in the 4th quarter in garbage time.  But maybe you think Giannis is a subpar wing."
Paul Millsap couldn't really score much beyond layups his first years in Utah.
Paul Millsap
I'm kind of amazed they're doing as well as they are with ancient-ass Paul Millsap getting significant minutes.

"I guess I just fundamentally disagree. It's a fan event showing off the brightest stars in the NBA. Team success should have nothing to do with it. It's commendable that players come together and make it work and have a ton of success in terms of wins, but that's not the spirit of the event. Let me give you an example, in 2014-2015 the Hawks had four allstars. They had Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague, and Kyle Korver. They had a really good record and clearly they deserved multiple AllStars, but Kyle Korver had no business being an AllStar. That guy is the ultimate role player. Really really good at what he does, but not an AllStar. That's what I'm talking about. So the Jazz would really deserve to have Mitchell and Gobert. Conley is playing well, but his numbers are in no way deserving of an Allstar nod. So who else would they get?"
"The way it is in the NBA, you play who you get. Cavs played a trash hawks team in the ECF that had Paul Millsap as their best player. Curious - do you give the 2019 title to the Warriors since Klay and KD got injured?"
"He's not an awful defender, but he's not nearly as good a defender as you might assume based on his body type (ala PJ Tucker and Paul Millsap). He's also a notably underwhelming rebounder for his position."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"The problem isn't Murray, he's playing through injury currently and is clearly in his head. He'll get back to form.  The problem is we have a coach giving players like Will Barton and Paul Millsap 35+ minutes a game. The problem is we keep losing players to time off, injuries to Gary Harris and in the bench and MPJ missing time due to covid. The problem is we lost Grant and Plumlee and we didn't add enough value to replace them. All of those are contributing far more than Jamal's stepback, I'd say."
Mikauos Kidd Gilchrist getting outplayed by 36 year old Paul millsap?
I still think he was a star but I know he wasn't a #1 guy. Al Horford was their best player that season but Paul Millsap was the team's best the next season.
"I think something to consider is Raptor shows impacts and involves on-off figures, so in perspective Grant on the Nuggets didn’t impact them too much whales counterpart was Paul Millsap or Barton compared to on the Pistons who’s next player at the moment is something like Josh Jackson and Saddiq  It showed last year whiteside was a defensive monster because Blazers had no other option."
"AD is a better lob finisher and rim protector than KG was.  IMO KG is what you would get if you took Paul Millsap's BBIQ and skill level and put it in Pascal Siakam's body. Great length and athleticism, terrifying in passing lanes, decent facilitator from the elbow, crafty face-up game, but not quite large or athletic enough to be a truly elite roll-man or rim protector.  To be clear I think KG is absolutely an all-NBA player in today's NBA - Paul Millsap has carved out a 14 year career in the league with nothing like Siakam's length or athleticism, I just don't think AD is a great comp."
