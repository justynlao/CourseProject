"In no particular order it's probably Quickley, the top 3 picks, Haliburton, Desmond Bane has been shooting super well, Pritchard had some great games and should be getting back from his injury soon, Tyrese Maxey was kinda balling when the sixers needed him to step up, Patrick Williams seems solid, and then Precious Achiuwa seems good whenever I see him? Idk I'm probably missing someone, but sure is 10 good rookies"
The fact that Patrick Williams is playing solidly and is getting no recognition is kinda saddening.
patrick williams might still be in there
"Quickley, Wiseman, Lamelo, Haliburton, Cole Anthony, Edwards, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, and I guess Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman?"
Patrick Williams has been solid in my very biased opinion.
1. Anthony Edwards  2. James Wiseman  3. Lamelo Ball  4. Patrick Williams  5. Isaac Okoro  We're 20 games into these guys' career and none of them have looked like they don't belong. Wait at least a year before you try to bring up this discussion.
"Pleasant: Thad Young, Temple and Patrick Williams  Unplesant: Coby and Sato, Wendell's injury, our entire defense."
Lol lavine is nice!! How’s Patrick Williams lookin?lauri went beast mode the other day!
"Coby White, Garrett Temple, Patrick Williams or Otto Porter Jr, Thaddeus Young, Wendell Carter Jr. Not the worst pretty good."
"Three huge differences: the rockets and harden relationship was publically toxic, Brooklyn flipped unprotected picks that will likely be extremely valuable with all their stars into their 30s, besides kyrie (vs your offer where Memphis is virtually guaranteed to be in the playoffs throughout the 7 seasons you are allowed to trade picks for), AND Tillman Frittata refused to take the better offer of Ben simmons who was on the table, because he's a fuckstick.  The wizards have a good relationship, beal is not harden, the picks available from Memphis are nowhere near as valuable potentially, and I just think yer full stop wrong that teams won't flip young talent for beal.  I dont want the dubs flipping wiseman for him, and I don't think they will, but you absolutely have the convo.  &gt;Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc.  Re-sign beal and you can pair any of these guys with him to begin with..."
"I also don’t think those guys you mentioned will be included in any trade as with a player considerably better than Beal in Harden the rockets did not get a player back that is as valuable as JJJ. They got possibly 1 year of Oladipo, two players worse than any of the players Memphis will offer and a bunch of picks and swaps. I would take Memphis’ young pieces with team control for longer than Oladipo and maybe 2 less picks/swaps over the package for Harden and that’s James Harden we’re talking about not Bradley Beal.  I understand the whole ticket selling perspective, but I think in 1.5 seasons or so you can have that right back with someone like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc."
Isn’t he like the 2nd youngest guy in the class after Patrick Williams? Everyone is so impatient it’s like if he doesn’t have a Ja Morant rookie year he’s no good
"&gt; steph underperformed so they threw everything at stopping KD  Steph AVERAGED 25-7-5 on 71% TS in that series, 71%. They threw ""everything"" at KD, i guess everything was 9 inches shorter Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams.  &gt; steph also underperformed in the HOU series  Steph underperformed so much that when KD went down he carried Golden State to back to back wins and a 4-2 victory.  &gt; it was KD winning them games, hate to break it to u  KD was the best player on a team that without him still went to the Finals and was a Klay Thompson injury away from beating the Raptors. He was sensational, probably the best player in the league, but to act like there was no comparison between his 2019 version and Kobe in 2013, it is laughable."
"LeBron played against Kevin Willis (born September 6th 1962) and Patrick Williams (August 26th 2001) so almost 39 years span. If he plays against Aleksej Pokusevski (December 26th 2001) he goes over 39 years.  LeBron might get to a quite high number, if he can continue to play."
"Honestly Chicago Bulls. This team lacks of primary playmaker and also Ben should play point forward he can defend all 5 positions can switch to everybody. Chicago Bulls starting 5 is full of shooting specialists.   He can play 4 with Markkanen at the 5 and can cover Markkanen's lack of post defending and also he can play point guard for them and they can let White to be microwave scorer.  Garrett Temple, Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams/Otto Porter Jr, Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen five is balanced can be effective on both sides."
"I could argue that Patrick Williams doesn't even deserve to be on the board right now, but I have a feeling that in 5 years we'll consider him the best player from this class. His game just screams late-bloomer."
"So, I love Patrick Williams. But sometimes I wonder what if"
Dennis Schröder evolves into Patrick Williams who evolves into Clint Capela.
Fr. Dude needs glasses if he thought LaMelo played good today or he has extremely low standards for him. I'm not worried about him though as he's still played well this year. Patrick Williams played some decent D which is nice for y'all
no patrick williams hurts
"We're in the ""figuring how to close out games"" stage of the rebuild rn  Zach LaVine needs some respek put on his name. Also, Lauri returning to form (aka not being forced to be a spot-up shooter) is big.  Billy Donovan is a godsend compared to Jim Boylen.  Patrick Williams is a dark horse ROTY candidate"
"That trade would not make the bulls better. What are you thinking?  Simmons, LaVine, Patrick Williams, Thad, WCJ. That’s an okay to good starting 5.   Bench: Gafford, Arch, Denzel Valentine, ????"
"his defense is much improved this year and will continue to get better as this team settles into their new defensive scheme. He’s athletic enough to be an average defender if he puts in the time, and there’s no reason to suggest he won’t. He absolutely could be a 1st option on a contender with his scoring ability but we would need at least need another star to get into that contender position. Patrick Williams also could be that other star we’ve been looking for, just need to wait for his development."
Patrick Williams or LMelo were better choices in hindsight
"Thanks, me too. Dwane's rotations are maddening, but it feels like there's a plan in place here for the first time in forever. I think Troy Weaver really knows what he's doing. With that being said, if things don't change by the trade deadline I probably won't feel the same. We're feeling really good about Stewart (whose impact is far beyond what his numbers suggest)and Bey. Jury's still out on Killian, but I'll just say early returns don't look great.   Also Patrick Williams was my number 1 choice for us this year so it's good to see him doing pretty well."
Dennis Schröder evolves into Patrick Williams who evolves into Clint Capela.
"ok, still would rather than him than Patrick Williams since I know you're a Bulls fan"
Tried to make a semi realistic cap situation with my list and take into account fit. Not in any particular order.   Luka Lavine Haliburton Patrick Williams Zion Jokic Giannis Dort Jarrett Allen Lamelo Ball
"He was red hot in the first half, torching Patrick Williams and Garrett Temple. I feel like Lavine did a good job on him defensively in the second."
"* Markkanen playing well * Bulls defense is better than usual, they are getting more turnovers and more easy fast breaks than usual * Bulls are limiting their turnovers (so far lol) - this usually kills them * Mavs are down 6 guys (3 starters I think) * Bulls bench killing it - Garrett Temple is a god.  Underrated - Lavine was defending Doncic well. He took over midway through the 3rd and slowed him down after 30 in the 1st half. Doncic was torching the bulls rookie Patrick Williams."
"Potentially, but I’m optimistic that it wouldn’t be much of a problem. I think we have enough weapons on offense that his playmaking and defense would more than make up for his offense. Zach can clearly carry an offense, Coby is a score-first guard, and even Patrick Williams has shown some real potential on offense. Lauri is also (theoretically) a plus on offense, but personally I’d try to trade him."
"Ok and where did I say he should be? I literally said both can be true, you can put up lots of numbers efficiently and also not have a good offense. I didn’t say anywhere that they should run more offense through Patrick Williams. I’m just pointing out box score numbers (including efficiency) can really blind how good players are when it comes to comparing players.  Take Luka vs Lavine for example. Luka just got KP back but the Mavs are a way better team and have a better offense than the balls, despite having a worse team sans KP. It’s easy to look at the numbers and shooting %s and be like “well lavine is WAY better than Luka”. That would be blatantly false.  You can be a player that takes the ball, tries spending 18 seconds of the shot clock dribbling the ball, trying to get an easy shot or assist and if that fails you just dump the ball of to a teammate who is left with a few seconds on the clock trying to make something out of nothing. You can at the same time generate good, efficient stats for yourself while dragging down your team. Obviously that’s an exaggeration but it’s those nuances that separate guys like Booker, Young and Lavine from guys like Luka, Dame and CP3 even though they put up similar or even better stats and efficiency numbers and why you actually have to watch players play than just comparing stats all the time. It’s what those who were clamoring Young for MVP don’t understand how he actually hurts his offense at times. Lavine is getting better but it’s not like he’s some top 15 player now. There’s a reason the bulls still have a mediocre offense and they’re not exactly bereft of offensive talent compared to some of the teams ahead of them in the standings."
"Is there scope to increase his usage at the expense of Graham, yeah.   But Ball's 23.7% usg rate is decent for a rookie, and when combined with his minutes played it's extremely impactful.  By comparison Patrick Williams has played the 2nd-most minutes but has a 16.7% usg.   Anyway my point was Ball was expected to have an impact on offense but likely not to lead all scorers."
"Eric Gordon, Wes Matthews, Bradley Beal, and (so far) Patrick Williams. I’m running a mostly guard lineup bc shaq can carry defensively when needed and they’re smaller and faster than the bigs. Also I’d only really be lacking at the 4 position."
"I think Haliburton wins it, and Patrick Williams could be in the race for it too, can’t forget about him."
What? No it absolutely wouldn’t. Look at this years draft. You trying to say that a player like Isaac okoro or Patrick williams would make this a great trade???
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
Patrick Williams was a bit of a surprise at 4 but he has impressed so far.
"Patrick Williams is like the most low key draft pick this year but already looks real comfortable and is putting up excellent shooting numbers hitting 47/45/85.  Starts almost all his possessions at the 3 point line and either takes the open 3, attacks the close out for a nice mid range jump shot, 1 handed floater, or lay in.  I Think he's supposed to be a good defender too but I haven't seen enough on that end yet."
"two parties - one side sees him as developing into a more team oriented player who's able to hit game winning shots, and dont want to let another guy go before they grow into who they can be (i.e. jimmy butler).   the other side sees a full rebuild on the horizon with the new front office and patrick williams being the only core pieces. zachs stock is very high, so he'd need to net a huge amount, more than it took to get jrue for sure"
"I see no mention of Patrick Williams here, Lamelo is not locked for ROTY by any means. Lebron compared PWill to Kawhi as a defender. Patrick Williams forced 2 airballs, and a block on Lebron in one game. He is only just getting comfortable with his offense, we will see some huge games in the future."
"Would I be foolish to want to trade MPJ for Patrick Williams + Wendell Carter Jr?   Part of me thinks so because MPJ could be really, really special. I'm pretty convinced he could average 25+ PPG on 50/40% splits *right now* with the right team/role.   But on the other hand, it also feels like pretty good value unless I'm overestimating Williams and/or WCJ"
"Yeah he has been a beast for sure, from the outside looking in it seems he's giving more effort (particularly on defense) now that he has a coach he doesn't hate lol.  That being said, as good as he is I don't think he's exactly what we need, and I don't think the pure scoring talent of the hypothetical team is enough to conquer the misfit.  But that does make me wonder how well Patrick Williams has been playing...."
"Yea I gotcha. Miles Bridges, Patrick Williams, Tatum, etc. All of them have yet to surpass him though"
Patrick Williams came out of nowhere for me. I didn’t watch much FSU before the shut down but 3 days before the draft ppl had him top 5
&gt;Do you know of any players in past drafts that got their pick because of a great interview?   A lot of people had Okoro mocked at the end of the top 10/early teens before his combine/interview where apparently everyone loved him.  Same with Patrick Williams.
"Can't wait for the day when Patrick Williams clips have like 1k upvotes. Also, this is peak basketball. Beautiful."
Patrick Williams is probably are only untouchable guy right now tbh
Patrick Williams is amazing too.
Great Example: Patrick Williams has been one of our best defender. Kawhi was cooking him. Billy Donovan switched to Zach covering Kawhi and he was forcing him into some tough spots. He’s made such a leap. Zach is a legit two way player now and he needs in be considered in the top 5 SG conversation right now.
"It’s great seeing Patrick Williams do well, it has to be tough for everyone to laugh and call you a reach draft night"
"Do you think the Bulls are one superstar away from seriously contending? Or should we give them 2 more years for the younger players to learn? I honestly believe in the Bulls, really wish for them to go back to the playoffs again. I'm very excited about Coby White and Zach, and is watching Patrick Williams."
Patrick Williams continues to impress me.
Buying real estate on Patrick Williams island. What a pick
What a brutal stretch for patrick williams. Had to deal with lebron splashing 20 ft turnarounds in his eye 2 days ago now has to deal with chasing kawhi around screens just to watch him bury 3 after 3. The guy is doing all he can but hes got an impossible job right now lol
We’re what 10 games into the season and the games already slowed down for Patrick Williams? 2nd best rookie I’ve seen with my own eyes so far
This Patrick Williams kid is good
Keep in mind Lakes played 7 terrible teams in 9 games.   Of course he is going to have an all star defensive stint when he goes up against *checks depth chart*   Kyle Andersen   Josh Okigie  Patrick Williams
Patrick Williams Rookie of the year because Lebron fears him
What about Patrick Williams
"Lavine has improved both on ball defense and play making. In fact, Bulls pretty much let him be the primary ball handlers. Satoransky and Lauri been out so they been running alot of line up with their wings Temple, Valentine, rookie Patrick Williams, Otto Porter; Thad Young been playing small ball 5 for them; naturally they shoot more 3s from the eye test.  Colby white looks pretty good as a scorer too, he's a lowkey black hole but boy can get buckets"
No doubt but compared to other rookies like Patrick Williams or Anthony Edwards it's unlikely he'll have the stats
Really traded Luka Doncic for this bum and poor man's Patrick Williams /s    What's wrong with Trae :( He was so good just last year ...
"I think Patrick Bev and Lou Williams are overrated, and would take Caruso over them any day."
"Cooked? Lmao, I would at least expect a bulls fan to recognize defense from one of our players.   Lebron cooked our team by abusing our double team all game...lebron however did not cook Patrick Williams in the 1 on 1 post up which led to Patrick Williams forcing the tough shot EVERY time and 2 air balls. Not to mention he had a couple stops on Harrell. Patrick Williams played high level defense as a rookie. Put some respect on that.  "" omg but mvp lebron did his famous statline"" that's not the point, lebron outplayed our team but Patrick Williams stopped him in the 1 on 1 match-up all night.  And that is worth noting, don't be a part of the circle jerk."
"Dignity? Patrick Williams played incredible defense on lebron tonight and not one person in the comments is recognizing it. That's bs, I don't regret my comment. Patrick Williams forced 2 air balls on lebron and literally a fade away every possessions yet we are here circle jerking to lebron. A rookie gave him the business. Not to mention lebron almost lost to a team in development, won by one point, and again we have a thread full of lebron memes and circle jerks. Fuck that. Idgaf, if I get downvoted, my dignity stands in knowing I'm not a lakers fan."

Patrick williams is a stud. You see his box scores and don't realise the impact he has on a game. He has been guarding all the superstars like giannis and LeBron and also has been putting up 10ppg. He even has a good mid-range game and can also shoot 3s. He might now be the ROTY but might be the MVP of this draft .
Patrick Williams was getting a taste of the LeBronto treatment. He was getting cooked by those fadeaways.
"The annoying thing was I thought Patrick Williams played pretty good defense on him in this trial by fire situation, but it didn’t matter because Bron kept doing this. So annoying for the opposing team but shit gotta respect it"
"Deni has exceeded my expectations and Pritchard looks just like he did at Oregon. Maxey could be really good in a few years and Patrick Williams doesn't look as ""bust-y"" as he was touted to be. Wiseman and Anthony look completely NBA-ready as well. Edwards seems to be a better shooter than was thought. Quickley and Precious are contributing. Excited to see more of Nnaji, Bey, Terry, Elijah Huhes, and Tre Jones."
"Patrick Williams should be at least mentioned, the guy has been solid so far."
Felt like Patrick Williams did a solid job defending LeBron for a rookie.
"“Lmao, getting dad dicked by a rookie all game. 2 air balls when Patrick Williams was guarding him, and forced fade aways all game with a hand in his face.  Gets babysat too by the refs, his last drive of the game was an offensive foul. AD is your mvp.”   Someone is still crying awe maybe you’ll get respected more if you didn’t use the term “dad dicked” lmfao"
"Patrick Williams played incredible defense on Lebron and also Harrell. Kind of ridiculous no one is mentioning it, he fucking locked down lebron on numerous possessions....forced 2 air balls on Lebron too.  Kind of annoyed we have a game where we played our hearts out and the entire thread is 27-7-7 memes. No worries, our team will be respected soon."
"Lmao, getting dad dicked by a rookie all game. 2 air balls when Patrick Williams was guarding him, and forced fade aways all game with a hand in his face.  Gets babysat too by the refs, his last drive of the game was an offensive foul. AD is your mvp."
"The ""goat"" got shutdown by our rookie. Patrick Williams forced 2 air balls on lebron and forced a fade away almost every match-up vs lebron. He stopped Harrell too.   Kinda wish Lebron got called for dropping his shoulder on drives."
"Lebron definitely whoops Bronny, the Child Abuse we have seen tonight on Patrick Williams is evidence of this."
Patrick Williams dont know about that old man strength
Patrick Williams
Patrick Williams
1. Payton Pritchard  2. James Wiseman  3. Patrick Williams
"It's honestly a well-scouted class. Other than the funky case of Patrick Williams, basically every lottery prospect has the anticipated strengths/weaknesses.  If anything, I'm surprised there's no obvious busts. Killian Hayes has looked the worst, but rookie PGs often need time and anyone who watched him (and not just read KOC) knew he was raw."
"not the roty, but patrick williams looks very promising. good shooting, handles an defence. might be kawhi esque player in his prime"
Patrick Williams and Coby White are studs. Chicago has a bright future.
Apparently AK and the FO really likes both Patrick Williams and Tyrese Haliburton so that’s a good thing
"I truly believe as an FSU fan, they would have won the NCAA tourney had it not been cancelled. Senior PG in Forrest (on the Jazz now), two lottery picks in Patrick Williams and Vassell, a great supporting cast w/ MJ Walker etc, and the entire team played so hard especially on defense.  Probably would have been a one-seed. An all-time what might have been... They were absolutely dominating teams."
patrick williams - kawhi lite
"A lot of us wanted Patrick Williams and thought he would still be on the board at 12 while Haliburton would be long gone. Then Patrick's stock went through the roof, and Tyrese fell. Funny how that happens. You won't find a single Kings fan that's disappointed with Tyrese though."
I'm glad we went with Patrick Williams right now
Patrick Williams

Patrick Williams

Warriors need to trade for coby White and patrick Williams so they can run a White/Wanamaker/Wiggins/Williams/Wiseman lineup
"From the latest ringer article.   Doc Rivers was loyal to Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, and Montrezl Harrell, and kept them in roles that fit their games. But all that is out the window under Lue. Beverley is averaging the fewest shots (5.7 per game) he has since his rookie season, Williams is down to no. 6 on the team in touches (35.7), and Harrell is on the Lakers.  (Lou was second in touches. More than PG last season)"
"Patrick Williams has been a stud on defence and has a good mid-range game on offence. He's decent at shooting from 3 and around the rim but he hasn't been taking many shots. For a rookie from a class which had 0 preperation time, he has really impressed me. He had 2 blocks and 3 steals against the mavs which was really impressive."
Honestly they'd probably have a chance in the East; the Bulls have been missing a true lead guard and SGA would do wonders there. Thunder also flush out the depth chart.   PG: SGA / Satoransky / George Hill   SG: LaVine / Coby White / Dort   SF: Otto Porter Jr / Patrick Williams / Justin Jackson  PF: Lauri Markannen / Thad Young / Darius Bazley   C: Al Horford / WCJ / Muscala
"It’s not project to franchise guy.   Projects are Patrick Williams, Jarrett Culver, etc.  This guy could’ve been the number one prospect barring injuries in his class."

"I think it was always a deep draft. A lot of guys have came in and helped their teams, even some late picks second rounders.   Pritchard has been great for the Celtics. Theo Maledon has looked very good. Xavier Tillman and Desmond Bane are effective rotation players and spot starters for a .500 team. Immanuel Quickley looks like he's gonna be a very good player. Isaiah Joe from Philly is still very raw but when they needed a shooter to insert into the lineup he played generally well.   And then I think there's quite a couple more second rounders who will become solid rotation players. Saben Lee has had some good flashes for Detroit, Paul Reed is tearing up the  G League for Philly.   All of those guys picked 20+, and then add on Wiseman, Patrick Williams, Lamelo, Halibuton with all-star potential and then Bey, Achiuwa, Maxey from non-lottery picks showing future starter ability. It's a good draft, and there's always going to be late bloomers as well"
I would put Haliburton and Quickley over him anyday Patrick Williams too

Serena Williams and Patrick Muratoglou
"Keep Lamelo, Halliburton, Patrick Williams Wiseman and Edwards, trade the rest for veterans"
Before the game thread gets heated I just want to say I love Zach Lavine and Coby White and think Patrick Williams is going to be a stud
"Stanley Johnson, Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Rui Hachimura, DeAndre Hunter, Patrick Williams, Issac Okoro"
"I've been watching the rockets since the mid 90s, though I don't see how that matters.  The team was always structured around harden, but that doesn't mean we had washed players.  Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight (not prime, but still was a double double machine then), prime Ariza, Gordon, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, Chandler parsons (who got max contracted right after his rockets stint), post NYC Jeremy Lin, Ryan Anderson when he could still move, capella, and plenty of other veteran depth signings along the way.  The players weren't trash. It just takes a ton to win, and the only year we had all the pieces was when cp3 was here."
"Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, and reggie Jackson are great for running point in the regular season for running point, but yall need a point gaurd in the playoffs"
"Na I really think a car is.   Once they've been drafted, their value from then on is like a stock. But look at the way people value picks next year once the draft is closer  They'll be like ""Zach Lavine isn't worth the #4 pick no way"" despite the fact that the odds of the #4 pick being anywhere close to as good as lavine are quite low. But if you're like patrick williams or Lavine, they'd all rather have lavine.   People fetishize the value of what a pick *could* be rather than what the expected outcome is."
"I think this draft class is gonna produce a lot of good pros. I think people seem to equate draft that has stars as automatically ""good"".  Ball, Edwards, Wiseman, Haliburton, Patrick Williams, Jaden Mcdaniels all look really good to me long term. I know I'm missing some but I'm a wolves fan so most of the games I watch are those.  Ive watched a lot of Edwards play and he does things that most guys can't. Better shot selection and playmaking will come in time.  His defense will get better as he matures. He has star potential."
"I didn't follow him much at OKC but he's been good at identifying each player's strengths and weaknesses and making gameplays according to them. Sounds basic but  here are some changes I saw over these 30 games  1) Lavine's improved shot selection, defence and off ball movement. Lavine is getting better as a defender, active hands and getting over screens well. Sometimes doesn't come as help quick enough but he's learning. He's been given the green light to take mid-range jumpers and he's making them, his 3pt shots have been a healthy mix of catch and shoots and off the dribble  2) Thad young's role as a bench facilitator and post player. Boylen made Thad a spot up shooter but Billy's usage of Thad has been excellent. He's running plays through Thad, where he finds cutters or executes dribble handoffs. If all of those fail, he has enough skill to make his own shot by posting up and jump hooks.   3) Drop coverage defence. We used to get destroyed by pick and rolls earlier in this season due to our centers dropping too deep. Now the guards are fighting hard over the screens and the centers aren't dropping much  making it difficult for the opposition guards to make a decision and this has been helping us a bit.   4) Ball movement has improved a lot, helping us create a lot of open looks for Coby White, Lauri , Temple and Patrick Williams, whose 3pt shooting %s have all improved from last season.   Really excited to watch bulls games as we seem to be making adjustments every game and coming out with a gameplan unlike last season ."
Patrick Williams stats look a little underwhelming but just take my word for it he’s an absolute stud
"Patrick Williams will be very, very good. That’s all"

"Really goes to show not necessarily that Donovan is a great coach or that it takes a great coach, but a bad coach can really deflate a team. As much as I love Patrick Williams especially for the future, the greatest addition it seems the Bulls have on paper over last year is the addition by subtraction of Jim Boylen. The team just *looks* entirely different."
"&gt;*but would you think Lakers would still trade for AD THIS year, given the team has THIS season’s iteration of Hart, Lonzo, and BI?*  Lakers with Julius, Kuz, Lonzo, Hart, BI or Lebron/Kuz/Zo/Hart/BI is very different.  I really like where Brandon/Zo/Josh are at, but I think they're still too young even now to fit on Bron's timeline. They can't hold off guys like Kawhi/Giannis/All of the Nets. Also, Bron's not great for *their* timeline. I like seeing Brandon get touches at running point, and having the pressure to carry a team with Zion--he needs those reps. He's *too good* to be a roleplayer for Bron.  The Pelicans without AD I guess would end up in the lottery 2020 draft and hit on Edwards, Wiseman, Ball, or Patrick Williams. Or we end up in a trade with the Celtics and we get a different young core to build off of and probably end up lottery after that first year anyway."
Man watching Patrick Williams is really weird cause the guy reminds me of a Leonard clone. Not even really based on his game but his mannerisms and how he carries himself on the court just like him is truly uncanny.
"Add 1 more unprotected 1st, 3 FRP swaps, and Patrick Williams."
Swap Lauri for Patrick Williams and add in another unprotected 1st.
"I think they desperately need a playmaker and defense and he'd be perfect leadership for Coby if they keep him around long term with Zach.   It wouldn't shock me, but I'd assume they'd make another move for their front court to balance it out, and maybe give Patrick Williams more minutes. I'm not sure what else the Raptors might be willing to give up to make it happen. I do think he'd be a boost to the Bulls playmaking woes though."
Patrick Williams isn't afraid. Fella pulled the trigger on that heave :D
Marcus Morris is not nearly as lengthy or athletically gifted. Pat Will can defend all 5 positions on the court as well.  [A good part of his weaknesses section is if his personality's too nice to be a dominant player](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/patrick-williams/)
*Lakers legends Lou Williams and Patrick Beverly
"* Apologies for not knowing John Collins' exact stat line off the top of my head, but I think what I said about him being an efficient, positive player who isn't having plays ran for him holds true. * Fair enough, but I did say injuries were an issue.  * Yeah that's not great, gotta concede on that one.  * I think Gallo's slump has a lot to do *with* Trae. He was fantastic on last year's Thunder with CP3. Why? Because CP3 is a natural playmaker who could put Gallo in good positions. This year, 50.4% of Gallo's shots come from catch and shoots. Last year, on the Thunder, it was only 45%. The year before, on the Clippers, 35%. They're using him like Ben McLemore when he's closer to Khris Middleton. Why? Because Trae has the ball so, so much. I know his sample size is small, but the same thing applies to Bogdan: on the Kings, 41% of his field goals came from catch and shoots, in nine games for the Hawks, it's 64%.  * The Bulls starting lineup is second-year Coby White, Lavine, rookie Patrick Williams, Lauri, WCJ. Otto Porter and Lauri have been injured for stretches, and they have no natural playmakers. They've repeatedly lost close games to contenders. Thad Young is the second best player on their team. Their roster talent is nowhere near comparable to y'alls, yet they're playing better. The Hawks are undeniably disappointing relative to the quality of players they've assembled.   As I said, it's not all Trae. Some of it is injuries, some of it is Pierce. But Trae has been this way since college. The ball is always in his hands, you live and die with Trae. And it makes him easy to scheme against. Look at y'alls first game against us (when most of your team was healthy, bar Gallo) and Trae was held to seven points. Why? Because when one guy has the ball, the issues of switching/rotations, tracking ball movement, positional size matchups, etc because less of an issue. That issue is magnified when the one guy who has the ball is a small 6'0"" tall guard. The Hawks should have feasted on the Hornets; we're a team that can't defend the three, has no inside presence (Capela had 19 rebounds), and a very weak bench. But if you stop Trae, you stop the Hawks, and we did it fairly effectively twice, despite missing Zeller and Devonte being in poor form."
"That doesn’t mean every young SF will develop like kawhi did  Kawhi is a rare case, you rarely see guys improve like that.   Raps fans say the same shit with OG lol.   Patrick Williams does look legit tho"
"Bulls are playing incredibly fun but inconsistent basketball coming out of a few terrible rebuild years with an awful coach. New coach, new front office, and a dedicated group of young players (including imminent All Star Zach Lavine and the youngest player in the league Patrick Williams), and one of the best veteran-led benches in the league. We still suck in crunch time (look at our record this year and note how many losses were lost by less than 6pts), but we are very quickly getting way better. Add this to the fact that Zach is about to make us a very attractive spot for FAs in the next few years, and we have a great many things to look forward to. We won’t be winning a chip any time soon, but we are poised to make a few deep playoff runs (prob not this year, tho we might make a brief appearance). Also, we have the best announcers in the league by far. Good announcers can make games so much more exciting. So yeah, that’s my bid for the Bulls—a bad and fun team that is about to be a good and fun team."
Patrick Williams is the youngest player in the NBA right now

Just like OG. And in .5 like OG. And in red shirt like OG.  Patrick Williams is OG's brother confirmed
You might want to add patrick williams to make it happen
I fucking love Patrick Williams.
"Patrick ""Mahomes"" Williams"
Don’t forget Rockets legends Lou Williams and Patrick Beverly on the Clippers
"Patrick Williams is a stud. I was a little questionable about him on draft night because he was a 6th man, and never heard his name in the pre draft hype. He has a smooth jumper and an unique defensive presence, with his hand size &amp; being able to guard multiple positions. I have high hopes for PWill"
Patrick Williams just be running around
"Do Bulls fans yell ""Flower Power!"" when Patrick Williams hits a big shot or block?"
I’d put Patrick Williams in the mix somewhere as well. It’s mainly Zach Lavine showing up but they’re technically 2 games behind 4th while sitting in 9th currently. If Williams can improve his defense and continue to make his shots when he’s called he can turn into that missing piece they’ve been missing in that position in a few years.
"Patrick Williams didn't start in college, neither did Zach Lavine. Donte was really good in college and has easily outperformed his draft expectation. Half the players outside the lottery don't make it in the league."
I really like Flower Boy for Patrick Williams. I hope he sticks with it and eventually becomes his brand. Flowers are cool. I like flowers.
Kemba for Lou Williams and Patrick Beverley.
"Anyone who thinks he's an empty stat guy (Hi Bill Simmons) just isn't watching. I have no doubt at this point that he could make up a ""super friend"" group and internally rank them however you want (like Kyrie technically being a ""third option"" or Anthony Davis being a ""second option"" or whatever). But look at the Bulls.. who are the other ""super friend"" guys? Coby White has been ass. Patrick Williams is a rookie who has struggled... Thaddeus Young is a nice player but he's a 25 MPG role player.  The Bulls aren't a ""Zach LaVine just being better"" away from being a contender...  I'm not overly invested in LaVine since I'm about 85 % sure he will likely leave for a better team in free agency so he can be part of a super friend team, it's just amusing how consistently bad takes are on him. You don't score 28.8 PPG on .649 TS% (without even the benefit of superstar officiating) by being some empty stat guy. Any team would be lucky to ad him as a free agent in a couple years."

Patrick Williams with 12 in the 4th. We got a good rook.
Patrick Williams is eerily similar to early Kawhi
Patrick Williams will always be Flower Boy to me.
"Thad Young's been their second best player this season, sadly.  Also, the team is incredibly young. Outside of Thad (13 years in the league), Temple (10), Otto Porter Jr. (7, and injured), Lavine (5), and Satoransky (4), everyone else has 3 years of NBA experience of fewer, including starters/rotation players Markannen, WCJ, Coby White, Patrick Williams, Denzel Valentine, and Gafford. On top of that, of the young players, it seems like only LaVine (if he still counts as being young) and maybe Markannen have borderline all-star potential. (The jury is out on Patrick Williams.)"
Still confident Patrick Williams will be the best in the group long term.
It's a requirement if you're a star. FWIW Patrick Williams will be doing it in the next 2 years.
"Honestly, I'm looking for Patrick Williams to do the same. The kid's a student of the game and watches Leonard religiously. Excited to see how he developed."
"&gt;I do wonder if a lot of the time there's a consensus #1 pick, and then whoever goes second is just the best physical prospect without regard to the other intangibles.  Hasheem Thabeet in a nutshell lol.  Yeah probably is a data problem. I also think that scouting is becoming a more level playing field even over the past 10 drafts, and it's going to be harder for even poor FOs to miss on good prospects given scouting consensus. I'm obviously biased, but Patrick Williams strikes me as a guy that would've gone much lower in the draft like 20 or 30 years ago with fewer teams giving the effort or having the tools to scout him. You saw how he shot up draft boards from like the #12 overall prospect to #4 very quickly before the draft. Teams like the Pistons, Cavs, and Spurs were apparently very high on him.  Another pick that really strikes me for low value is the 8th pick. Best All-Time would be Robert Parish, but he was selected 45 years ago lol. Since then, it's been... Tom Chambers? Jamal Crawford? Andre Miller? Kerry Kittles, Vin Baker, Ron Harper? All-Stars in here and quality players, but definitely dwarfed by HOFers that occupy spots around them."
"Hey, at least you guys have Zach LaVine right now. I'm also high on Patrick Williams, things are looking up in the post-Boylen era."
have you watched Patrick Williams cause you kinda just explained everything about him.
"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
Not as much as Patrick Williams
Zach LaVine has been great and probably should be an All-Star this year. I’m unconvinced on Coby White being our starting point guard though. He had a great game tonight and I’m tired of tanking but I’d loooove to see us get lucky with the lottery and draft Cade Cunningham. Also Patrick Williams is actually developing really well
"The shooting was the star of the show, but HUGE PROPS to Patrick Williams who played some great defense vs Zion tonight. That horrible 3Q from the Pels was largely his doing"
"Patrick Williams is the brightest of all of them. Dude is extremely polished, efficient and super high IQ. I think he's gonna be a big piece in our future. Right now Coby is struggling. He's a score first type of point guard and has problems with turnovers.   It's part of the reason why there's a large group of people who want Lonzo on our team. So Coby could come off the bench as a offensive spark and we don't lose close games due to turnovers. Last few games though he's been in an offensive slump so it's just all the cons with no pros.  Wendell is solid but he's just super injury prone. Valentine has his moments, he came through for us a couple games ago but he's definitely no more then a role player at best."
"The bulls lottery picks from the past two seasons, it’s not hard to draw comparison. This is their future we’re talking about here. Agree to disagree, but Patrick Williams has shown more promise imo"
"The headline of this post is just straight up wrong.  &gt; Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well  According to the unsourced Bleacher Report article... there's just one person who's ""ready"" to move on from Pat Bev?  Also it's strange to see that it's ""widely known"" Lou Will is available when that article is the only source saying that, sort of the opposite of ""widely known.""  Call me crazy but I don't know if a site called AHN Fire Digital quoting a speculative trade article from Bleacher Report is the best source for info..."
"&gt; “Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there’s a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well,” Fischer wrote.  Setting aside the source is a Bleacher Report article with little credibility, saying ""there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on"" is not even close to the Clippers making widely know Bev is available. Y'all stupid as fuck."
"&gt; he can shoot better than Rubio and plays decent defense  What's the argument then for why the Clippers suddenly get ""insanely dangerous"" if they downgrade at shooting and defense with Rubio instead of Beverley? Also, keep in mind that because of the hard cap a straight swap of Rubio for Beverley doesn't work, the Clippers would also have to add either Lou Williams to the trade, or both of Patrick Patterson and Daniel Oturu (while being unable to spend any money to replace those two empty roster spots because of the hard cap)."
"&gt; The whole basis of the trade is this quote: ""Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well."" No sources were cited.  You know this is the same language as all the Woj tweets right? Nobody second guesses him because everybody knows Woj is legit. So the question here is, do you trust BR?"
"What about the return of Raptors legend, Lou ""Maple Pepper"" Williams? Throw in Patrick Patterson and Ivica ""close enough to JV"" Zubac. We can probably get Amir from the G League for peanuts too. It's 2015 all over again."
"The difference in this circumstance is that Boucher was on offense against Patrick Williams much of the game, and we would switch him often onto Lavine as often as possible. He guarded Thad Young on defense much of the game as well. Vucevic ended up getting guarded by OG Anunoby, whether in a defensive switch or as a second defender, and even in that case, Boucher took two shooting fouls against Vooch."
Interesting how Patrick Williams isn't ever in the discussion. I'd say Tyrese should get it
You mean Old Patrick Williams
"Who does he normally matchup with on defense?  With Patrick Williams versatility and Levine and vuc, I feel like a big, solid decision making guard with good percentages is a good fit?  I suppose it's all comes down to the value of the contract though"
"Honestly I don’t even think it’s that.  Coaching and scheme was the problem.  I know Billy Donovan has been decent but you guys honestly might need to have a better coach to utilize Vuc and Lavine.  His lineups are terrible and just overall so big.  Plus Patrick Williams looks like he could be a defensive menace if let unleashed.  Those are keepers to build around but damn it if Billy Donovan isn’t so old school in the worst ways.  His best asset as a coach is enabling his star players though, so I’ll give him that."
Patrick Williams
"Do you want to know who are the guys which are even below Deni in this  VORP rank?  I will give you several names: Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, Isaac Okoro  Patrick Williams, Killian Hayes aren't much higher than Avdija.  Basically all top-10 selected rookies playing big enough minutes per game except Lamelo...  Yes... send them all to G-League"
"Theo is 6th.   Poku, Patrick Williams, LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Killian Hayes, then Theo"
"I don't really buy into his upside. He isn't special as a passer. Guys like Luka, Trae and Cade are all probably better.  He isn't a great shooter like 34% even if he improves (his form still looks janky AF) he needs to be elite at it because it is his primary means of scoring.  He isn't a great finisher. Struggles through contact, has pretty good touch but isn't very good for a guard let alone someone 6'8.  He has unclear positioning on Defence. He is too slow to guard 1s or most 2s. And too willowy to really guards 3s and some 2s.  The others also have wayyyy less experience in the man's game. Lamelo has had what 3 seasons to learn how to play against men even if he wasn't outstanding during that time. The others are still learning as they go especially wiseman. I think Lamelo will top out as a 22 and 10 guy who will make all-star games but the others I think will be all-nba calibre guys especially A1 and Patrick Williams who I think will be MVP candidates."
"Dude c'mon. Patience doesn't turn a score-first, awful defender like Coby White into an elite assist-giver and defensive stopper. Neither of those things are even remotely likely for Coby.  For a realistic answer to your question, the Bulls need Patrick Williams to be a legitimate elite defender, a true point guard who can efficiently distribute while adding 15 ppg (like a CP3-lite), Coby White needs to develop into an *efficient* 6th man who scores without hurting the team. All that plus they need a top 10 player. The contenders right now all have at least 1, the top teams commonly 2 (Lakers have 2, Nets have 3) top 10 players, or are built with insane depth/skill (Jazz).  Either PWill turns into prime Kawhi in the next 2 years, another top player wants out and we somehow trade for him, or Lavine becomes James Harden"
How in the absolute duck is Wiseman above Patrick Williams?
"Having Patrick Williams at 9 feels disrespectful, he should at least be 5"
Patrick Williams will be the best by year 3
Patrick williams is good
"If Patrick Williams can become all star within 2 seasons, I think they'd have a chance ot be contenders"
"Lavine to become a superstar, another all-star, Patrick Williams need to take a leap, Vucevic needs to stay and become a superstar, Coby needs to be a good good playmaker, acquire Lonzo."
Wonder how badly they'd beat this years squad  C - Wiseman  PF - Patrick williams  SF - Okoro  SG - Edwards  PG - Lamelo
Patrick Williams been solid.  Considering overall was considered a reach. He seems like the right choice for the pick
"yeah, this league is gonna be hella fun to watch for a long time. so many superstars in the making right now. I would also add Bam, booker, tatum, SGA. also, as a Bulls fan, Patrick Williams is going to be a star in this league in 2-3 years. he is 19 right now and already is a huge part of our team on both sides of the ball and from anywhere on offense"
"Edwards, Wiseman, Haliburton, Quickley and Melo are your first team; lock it in.  After that it gets murkier. Strong case for Patrick Williams, then in my mind there's a splattering of Bey, Tate, Campazzo, Pritchard (despite my irrational dislike of him - new Brad Wannamaker and all that), Stewart, and more I'm forgetting that it will be a footnote in their career that they made all-nba second team."
"1st Ant, Lamelo, Halliburton, Wiseman, Patrick Williams 2nd  okeke, campazzo, tate, quickley,isiah Stewart"
"Future All-Stars: Kevin Porter, Patrick Williams, and Lamelo"
Patrick Williams so goddamn good man
"I praised McDaniels literally last night. Very high on him.   I am high as shit on Melo, Haliburton, Patrick Williams and many more rookies.   Okoro can play thirty minutes and do absolutely nothing on the court."
"&gt; How have your takes on the other rookies gone?  Lamelo/Haliburton-- bang on. Absolutely right.  Wiseman. Wrong, thought he would be better.  Anthony Edwards. Depends how you look at it-- I thought he was overrated, and he was, but he has exceeded my expectations.  Bey. I thought he'd be good, he's better than I thought.  Patrick Williams/Deni Avidja/Poku/Isiaih Stewart pretty much as I predicted or better and worse.  RJ Hampton. Maybe wrong, I thought he would contribute, he should see more time with the Magic so we'll see.  Okongwu/Hayes I thought they'd be bad, I didn't think they would be that bad."
"For sure. I hope we can tank hard enough to get him. He would be perfect next to Patrick Williams.  Alternatively, I'd float a Lavine + Vucevic for Jalen Suggs pick + Bad Contract package to teams on draft night, especially if a team like the Warriors moves up in the lottery."
"Don't worry, I'm sure a lot of fan bases wanted him too. I know a lot of Bulls fans wanted him too and didn't know who Patrick Williams was."
"Uh I’m not sure the specific details, he mostly just tells me about nice gets he snags (he has a lamelo rookie holo that looks nice, should be a good sell in a few years assuming Melo’s trajectory continues), I think it’s a lot of Ebay sales and a combo of just off the shelf packs. Essentially (I think) they make new cards, print X of each and a combination of the number of prints and the success of the player drives its value.   So like the lamelo card he copped was a limited print before he got good, so the value is high because there aren’t many of this specific card and he’s now a better player. And it’ll be more valuable than cards lamelo printed after his success because they’ll print more of his cards now that he’s good  He also has a Patrick Williams Bulls card when he was number 9 which I think might spike it’s value if he ends up halfway decent because there’s not gonna be many #9 cards for him at all"
&gt; over ant?  I would  &gt; Haliburton?  Give me Haliburton though.  I'd redraft them Ball / Haliburton / Wiseman / Edwards personally. And I *really* want to put Patrick Williams in that 4 spot. Not high on Edwards at all.
"Edwards, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Halliburton should probably be the Top 4 in some order. After that you can have a discussion of Poku versus Wiseman for 5. Might be forgetting someone."
"If you’re talking redraft when the benefit of hindsight, I’d say the following guys I’d take over him:  Edwards LaMelo Patrick Williams Haliburton   So prolly 5th for me in a redraft."
"If I am picking top 3, why would I pick a guy that isn't a top 3 prospect? I am trying to pick stars.  Giannis as a prospect wasn't that good, wasn't even in top league in Greece. If Giannis was picked third, he wouldve struggled because  he would've been tasked with creating his own offense due to playing on a completely dysfunctional team.  Giannis development was standard for a guy who is a late lottery pick and has NBA skills. Most of development came when his body started changing and the ball was put in his hands. If anything, the Thunder who had the 12th pick should've drafted Giannis because they had the talent to take the risk of him flamming out. They drafted Steven Adam who had zero skills besides being big and strong. What's the difference between an unskilled 7 footer and a raw big wing with some guard skills?  Thinking raw players like Giannis will turn into MVP like players if you just put the time in is what leads teams to picking someone like Dragan Bender 4th and Bender actually played in a top European league, albeit off the bench. Suns could've had Jamal Murray, a guy that demonstrated he was clutch and capable of scoring at will in college.  I am taking that Jamal over some 7 footer that supposedly dribble and shoot but rarely get minutes.  My mentality is what leads the Warriors to pick LaMelo or Hali over James Wiseman. Lol, I would've even picked Patrick Williams over Wiseman if I wanted a project player. At least he plays the 3/4 wing, most important position in the NBA."
"Tonight’s game was a close one.  Id say if Lauri were to play to his full potential and Patrick Williams and Kobe develop a bit more, Bulls are a solid playoff team.  Could easily happen next year."
Derrick Jones Jr next to patrick williams and vuc would be cool  Obviously all bulls fans want lonzo but maybe we can get lucky in the lottery and land suggs who knows.  DJJ has a player option and I don't think he starts anymore with powell being there so maybe he opts out. Now that we have vuc we need to surround zach and vuc with good defenders and a switchable aggressive forward like DJJ would be awesome. I'd much rather have him than lauri's weak ass getting embarrassed every game.
Patrick Williams hit the R2 turbo button as soon as he saw it was Jordan Clarkson who was gonna have to match onto him in transition lol
"How do you know they will have at least 2 top 3-5 picks? Can you tell me if I’m going to win the lottery? Seems like you’re assuming there’s 100% that the Nets will have a terrible record, and the pick will hit 1-5 with the new lottery odds.   And probably the most laughable thing you assume is a 50% chance that a single top 5 pick will be better than Ben Simmons? That would essentially mean that you think Simmons is the average top 5 pick, which is just hilarious. The top 5 picks from the last 2 drafts were Zion, Jah Morant, RJ Barrett, DeAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Isaac Okoro. The only guys that have even shown the potential to be better than Simmons are Zion, Jah, and LaMelo (3/10)"
"""On June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations.""... yes he ""joined"" him...  ""On July 16, 2019, the Houston Rockets traded Paul, 2024 and 2026 first round picks, and 2021 and 2025 second round pick swaps to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Russell Westbrook.""... yes... also ""joined"" him"
They are closer than you think. They seem confident they have a future star in Patrick Williams. Add one big free agent signing and they will have 3-4 all star caliber players.   If Lauri or Coby White develop into anything worthy than they  are likely contending for 3 years starting 2 years from now
Thats just how much we trust patrick williams btw.. we trust him over what next two picks may be(that are top 4 protected btw) and we needed to convince zach to stay and to make bulls more desireable as a free agency spot.. also its too early to tell because we havent seen healthy zach and vooch together.. and we have kinda easy schedule after nets game
Love to see my guy Patrick Williams getting love from non Bulls fans after he was considered a major stretch and people laughed at the Bulls for the pick. I’m biased but I seriously think he has a super high ceiling.
Bulls FO gotta be screaming at Patrick Williams to work out with either one if these guys in the off season
Quickley is super nice and I’d love to have him on my team but I’m still taking Patrick Williams over him everytime
"Patrick Williams has been good, but quite frankly no. None of the rookies in the east have been even close to Lamelo."
"lol i thought this could happen, im surprised it actually did tho. I thought patrick williams or some1 like that would win it."
Patrick Williams is the greatest basketball player of all time already
Patrick Williams is gonna be what I thought Stanley Johnson would be.   The Klaw is probably a little much but I think Pat can be like Ron Artest(without the general Ron Artestness)
"harden had him beat on literally every stat on the way worse team. and no, durants defense wasn't ""far"" better, both were matched up with eachother quite often during the series.  yeah durant was able to dominate patrick beverley and lou williams, harden struggled a bit against the #1 jazz defense who guarded him from behind. give harden the warriors team and give kd the rockets team and its not even fucking close who wins, atleast harden made it a dog fight"
Yo Bulls.  We'll give you Lonnie Walker and Trey Lyles for Patrick Williams.  I want Williams and Vassel to join together again.
Great defensive move by Patrick Williams.
Wild guess... he’s talking about Patrick Williams.

patrick williams is a dog on defense.
"I was a giant critic of the Patrick Williams pick when it happened, but I think he is sufficiently proved me wrong at this point."
Whether we end up being a good team or not will largely depend on how good Patrick Williams and Lonzo end up being.  I have faith that AK will flip Lavine and /or Vucevic if he determines he can’t build a winner around these two.
"As an FSU fan, yes that is what he does. Coach Ham recruits plus athletes that are positionless then employs a switch everything defense and runs a deep bench with more athletes and basically tries to wear down the opponent with guys limiting minutes to go full force every minute they’re in the game.  He’s also a mastermind defensive coach, Patrick Williams said he specifically went to FSU to learn defense, and having to guard 1-5 no doubt helps him and other players at the next level."
I swear to god Patrick Williams did a great job on him
"Patrick Williams has started every game as a rookie and guarded the toughest 2-4 matchup. He is getting a crash course in becoming a lockdown defender and he's the 2nd youngest player in the league. If I was a betting man, and I am, I would easily have Pat Will as the best rookie in the class in 3-5 years."
"i just realized PaW is also a portmanteau of his name. PAtrick Williams, PAW"
"Patrick ""The Paw"" Williams."
On what planet is Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton on a level well below Patrick Williams
"Decided to toss this game on in the background while editing some stuff and happened to look up like 2 seconds before this happened.  Lost my shit, one of the best blocks I've seen in a hot minute.   Patrick Williams is gonna be sick, also."
If he paid 100k Vučević needs to be slapped. Patrick Williams didn't even wear number 9 in college. All star NBA vet is going to be punked out for 100k by an NBA rookie...
patrick williams the hedge fund guru
Nike is beside themselves that the 11 Patrick Williams jerseys in inventory are now worthless
"I hope so, but it’s been a rough few years rooting for this team, and Patrick Williams and lavines primes aren’t going to line up super well with vuc"
"They signed jimmy— who’s far better than anyone on the bulls— with no all stars but a few promising prospects on the team. This logic doesn’t really follow.  The lesson of the heat, again, was be an exciting young team with a competent and patient front office in a pseudo big market and a star will come in time and elevate the whole franchise.  Lavine, Patrick Williams, maybe Coby (or lonzo this summer) and another late lotto pick could’ve still been really enticing to a star free agent."
"“We literally have to pray that our fringe playoff team is an attractive free agent destination. That’s it. That’s the only hope now.”  As opposed to praying our fringe lottery team hits absolute gold in the draft as our only hope?  The Chicago Bulls are one of the most prestigious NBA franchises of all time. There will be a bunch of guys who want to play with Lavine AND Vucevic. A top free agent can easily see himself as the missing piece and sign with us. We have enough cap space going forward for another max contract. We have Patrick Williams, who has all the intangibles to become a serious star player. If you’re so worried about draft picks we still have our 1st rounder next year. If we tanked there was absolutely no way Lavine stays, dude is in his prime and tons of teams will throw him serious money. It’s not so often you come across a player like Lavine so when you do you do whatever it takes to keep him. We have a core of P Will, Lavine, and Vucevic. Potentially Lonzo Ball and potentially a star free agent in 2022. Building through the draft doesn’t work as much as you think it does. I don’t know how you can be upset about this as a Bulls fan. Would you rather go the route Detroit is going? You’re acting like we gave up all of our assets for Vucevic when that’s simply not the case. AKME know what they’re doing and even if this doesn’t work out they’ll go the route you want them to go so I don’t understand how you can be upset. Winning a championship isn’t as easy as just drafting a bunch of good prospects. There’s so many levels to it."
"How can you think that Karnisovas is such a genius drafter (“2nd round is where he strikes hold”) but also not want to see what he can do with 2 (potentially lottery) first round picks?  He’s already maybe struck gold once in the lottery with Patrick Williams, bozo."
Not saying I disagree.  I assume the Bulls are hoping Patrick Williams develops into a legitimate star.  That's really the only shot they have at winning with this core.  If it makes LaVine extend it's probably worth it.
"Patrick Williams is the most recent one to be given this ""next Kawhi"" moniker, so here we again I guess"
Plenty of failed super teams exist. Just look at the Clippers last year with Kawhi Paul George Marcus Morris Montrezz Harrell Patrick Beverly Lou Williams Jaymycal Green Reggie Jackson
"Harden had a better team, which is the main reason for the better record. Russ would've killed for backups life Eric Gordon and Lou Williams, not only that Harden had great pieces like Patrick Beverley and Clint Capela to fill out the squad.  People act like the Rockets won 55 games because Harden was that much better than Russ, when in reality the difference wins was due to better coaching and a better roster"
I have a real question- is lauri good? I always thought he had a lot of talent but it seems like he doesn’t do much. On the other hand I’ve always been a big sato fan and I think Patrick Williams is going to be a really good player.
"Yeah I’m not ending up in one of those throwback threads, looking like an idiot. In saying that though the Bulls will run the 2020’s when Patrick Williams and Zach Lavine both average triple doubles and become the first ever dual MVP’s."
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"
"I like patrick williams, big bias"
"between terrence mann, jonathan isaac, patrick williams, and devin vassell, FSU has had some great nba draft picks lately."
"Clippers, because their executives were sneaking around our arena during games trying to lure Kawhi, and I don't understand why Kawhi didn't at least run it back for one more year given how many people we had on expiring contracts. Yeah, PG13 is better than Siakam, but Patrick Beverly and Lou Williams aren't anywhere near as good as Lowry and FVV.  Also him leaving kind of sent us into a death-spiral which we're unlikely to recover from this season."
"Had a nice block later when Patrick Williams tried to dunked on him, refs called a foul but it looked pretty clean"
Patrick Williams is really low too somehow.
"Maxey right now is down 1 tier for me with guys like Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Kira Lewis, Patrick Williams, and Okoro. Flashed potential and has a future in the league but still is battling for his role. Give him time and I think he will have a nice career though."
Patrick Williams and RJ Barrett remind me of Kawhi Leonard

Ngl I was pretty happy that you guys took Patrick Williams. I said it on draft night that he's gonna be look like a steal by the end of the season.
"I think there was just a lot of questions on all the top guys. There was no clear cut star at the top like Zion or Ben Simmons. A lot of the questions have come back with positives. Ant is still raw but not too raw to play in the NBA. Lamelo has been a lot more well rounded then anyone expected. Wiseman has been hurt off and on all season so it is hard to really get a judge of him, but when he does play he is a positive for the team. Quickley, Saddiq Bey, Haliburton, Maxey, Patrick Williams etc etc, lots of players are helping their teams win games. This draft at this point feels closer to 2018 then it does to 2000."
"Speak your truth, Patrick Williams"
Patrick Williams
"Wiseman is gonna be a beast. He doesn't get big minutes, has had some injuries, and he's not even the 3rd focal point of the offense. I'm pissed the Bulls didn't trade up for Lamelo, I hope they at least tried to make a play for him. I like Patrick Williams, don't get me wrong, kid shows great work ethic. Lamelo and Lavine would have been so much fun to watch though."
"This draft is deep man. Bulls sucks but I want them to get in the playoffs.   Bulls blatantly tank for Ayton/Luka/Trae/etc and ended up with Wendell Carter Jr.   They do it again for Zion/Morant and ended up with Coby.   Bulls tried to win(to with Boylen 🤣) in what majority labeled a weak draft. And landed Patrick Williams.   It's not easy to develop players. Like the Knicks, Bulls are also full of rookie prospects. And you can't just pile up the team with rookies. Because they won't win games. And players don't develop losing."
"Patrick Williams, was Thad Young for a while but people caught on (somewhat same with Sato)."
"No, that narrative was distinctly for picks 4-10, which is perfectly reflected by the Patrick Williams pick."
yes. i think his record will be broken by Patrick Williams of the Bulls
Patrick Williams
"Bulls doesn't have the asset to give up in trades though. From the moment Bulls traded Jimmy Butler, their success is always dependent on player development. They got lucky with Zach. But Lauri has been plagued with injuries.   Back then I fantasize playing Lauri at center and AG at PF. Even without Pat Will, I was hoping Otto could stay healthy. Should have been a good fit on paper. But looking at my take two years ago, it really looked bad now 😂   Lauri is soft and dude can't be a full time center. Bulls currently don't have an identity. Other than Zach bailing them out in some nights.   I won't really think of fit right now, because Bulls roster is currently full of tweeners. Coby is a PG who is a high volume scorer, who struggles to make plays. Wendell is a center who can't protect the paint, struggles in PnR switches, struggles in the post and struggles to rebound. Lauri can't even stay on the floor...   We just got lucky Paxson stepped down, AKME got hired and Donovan is not coaching. Bulls another year or two of player development IMO. Then maybe they are in position to make trades and supplement their needs. Right only Zach and Patrick Williams can be considered as Bulls core. I don't see any major trades from AKME."
"Defenses key on Lavine, especially during clutch moments which leaves a corner shooter open. Patrick Williams hit a couple clutch shots this season because of that too"
Patrick Williams
"He played with Towns years ago and he has gotten way better since then. Im talking about the Lavine we've seen for the past 2ish years.  *It’s not like Lavine has no good players on his team*  Who? TBH I like the Bulls' future, but they absolutely do not have any ""good"" players besides Lavine.  Markkhannen has been out for over half their games and he is **barely** a ""good"" player.  Coby White is averaging 16/5 on terrible efficiency and average/below average defense  Wendell Carter Jr with his 12/8 is average at best but he's also missed close to half their games.  After that, their next best players are Thad Young, Patrick Williams, and Garrett Temple.  Again, I like the Bulls' future. I think Coby, Wendell Carter, Patrick Williams, and Markkhanan are all going to be really good players. But they are definitely not there yet. I don't know how you can look at this roster and think that is even a halfway decent roster. Even with all that though, the Bulls are half a game from the 7th seed. I truly think they are several games worse if you replace Lavine with Mitchell because while Mitchell would very slightly improve their defense, he doesn't improve anything else and the Bulls would score way less points because he isn't anywhere near as efficient as Lavine."
"Okoro, Jaden McDaniels, Payton Pritchard, Xavier Tillman have all also been better defensively in my opinion. That also doesn't include players I think are more arguable but are there is also Desmond Bane, James Wiseman, Patrick Williams, and Saddiq Bey."
"Judging by the flair, no one will ever be able to get through to you that   -	cap space doesn’t matter much when you’re rebuilding -	7.5 million a year is lower than the average nba salary in 2021.  Here are other players making around that much:  Patrick Williams, Juan Hernangomez, De’Anthony Melton."
"&gt;Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, Kristnaps, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson.  Yes I'll take one of those, thanks."
"&gt; Also, if the Minny picks conveys this year, the Dubs should be charged with robbery as a result of this trade.  Injuries to Russell and KAT have drastically changed the perspective people have regarding this trade. Here is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ezw6ph/wojnarowski_golden_state_has_agreed_to_trade/)from when it happened.  In the end, I truly believe there is no way to view the trade as a robbery because:  1) Wiggins clearly wasn't able to be maximized by the Wolves organization  2) The theoretical benefit of keeping KAT happy cannot be measured (he wanted to play with D-Lo)  3) At worst the pick conveys this year at 4th overall (or in theory next years draft at #1 overall). Although lottery picks are always valuable, it's really the 1 or 2 pick that usually provide immediate value. Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, **Kristnaps**, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson. Obviously different organizations can be better at drafting but that's 11 drafts in a row where the #4 pick (outside Porzingis) hasn't produced all-star level talent.  4) On top of all that, the Wolves do not need more young, developing talent. If the pick conveys this year at 4 (in what is supposed to be a strong draft) we miss out on that asset but with KAT on the team we should be trying to compete for a playoff spot.  Looking back at the thread, many people predicted a Wiggins renaissance. Clearly the Warriors saw that potential and I'm assuming our front office did as well. But it was definitely the right move for the Wolves to make, even looking at it now."
"I'm going to stop you right there. Patrick Williams definitely 100% deserves a spot over KMJ. It's asinine to even suggest otherwise. I'd say the same about Okoro but to a lesser extent. They've played so many more games than KMJ and started pretty much all of them. Other 2 are fair. I'd probably put him over Wiseman too honestly, but I just don't see him replacing the rest"
"He averages a similar statline on much better effieicncy than Okoro  A straight up better statline on  better effieciency than McDaniels  The same statline as Patrick Williams on 6 less minutes  Better statline at everything other than assists as Campazzo, but much better efficiency"
"Who is he replacing on this list: Ball, Edwards, Haliburton, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, Saddiq Bey, Quickley, Okoro, Bane, Cole Anthony, Campazzo, Stewart, Jaden McDaniels, Wiseman. He’s gotta be better than 4 people to make it"
pick 52 Kenyon Martin Jr is better at nearly every single stat than pick 4 Patrick Williams
I might be biased but I was thinking the same thing... Are Desmond Bane and Patrick Williams really putting up better numbers than him as a whole??
On the flip side Patrick Williams looks really solid for you guys. I like his game a lot.
1. Anthony Edwards  2. LaMelo Ball  3. Tyrese Haliburton  4. Facundo Campazzo  5. Saddiq Bey  6. Immanuel Quickley  7. Jae'Sean Tate  8. Patrick Williams  9. Cole Anthony  10. Desmond Bane
"NBA doesnt care if you go to college or if you do well in college anymore. If you have the ability to be the number one pick, you'll be the number one pick. Teams don't care about where you're from or your accolades. Patrick Williams was a bench player in college and got taken #4 overall. When you're 18/19 you're still a growing kid. Teams want that guy that has the best chance to become a superstar and its super rare for a player to become a superstar right away. Cade vs Green is no different than Ant vs LaMelo. Both great prospects, but with different skills. LaMelo and Cade are better passers and have a better feel for the game right now, but Green has that physical ability that could make him an elite superstar if he develops in the right way."
Patrick Williams locked him up
"They are going to decide whether they want to rebuild or win now this offseason by doing one of the following  1. Trade lavine/vucevic for draft picks/young players (possibly with golden state) 2. Trade Patrick Williams/Coby White for win now players and/or sign free agents such as Lonzo Ball.  Regardless, Artūras Karnišovas track record is pretty good considering how he helped the Denver Nuggests so I think questioning his moves this early in his tenure with the Bulls (aka thinking you know more than he does) is misguided at this point."
"So, i'm confused because to me, you guys did a beautiful rebuild. Devin Vassell looks to be a very promising player that has a lot of potential, same with Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, Murray looks pretty good (i'd even say he's gonna look very good next year) and Poeltl is finally starting to grow into what a lot of fans thought he could be. I wouldn't be surprised if most of these players become solid starter or even fringe allstar tier players given how they look at under 25. Maybe one of them will take the leap into all star tier. In 1-3 years or so depending on how FA works out, you guys are also primed to make the next package for a superstar.  You have probably the best FO to scout and help develop players given your record, the ""shot doctor"" in Chip Engelland to start these players off with a good shot, and the goat coach at the helm. Remember the 2014 Spurs?  Pop has taken a team with Demar as their best player, a couple of aging veterans from the glory days who have taken the bench role to ease the transition, the promising young players I named, and others, to a record thats better than teams with cores of:   Ingram+Zion+Lonzo, Fox+Hield+Barnes+Haliburton, SexLand+LNJ+Allen-KLove, LaVine+injuries, Raptors/Nurse magic, WB+Beal, Pacers-coaching staff.   IN ADDITION, they're within striking range of the Warriors and the Hornets.  Sure DeMar is probably better than some/most of those players, but I would argue he also has far less help. Like, you guys are doing *great*. As a Warriors fan, I think we have a pretty solid FO given our track record, but man I really wonder what Engelland could have done for Green's shot or something. I really wonder if the Spurs FO in our position would have picked Patrick Williams or something."
"Buying stock in this thread on May 6, 2021, for when Patrick Williams becomes a future all-star. Thanks, Sam."
"The Sabonis deal is bad for the Mavs, all the others are bad for us except maybe the Patrick Williams swap."
Dude Sabonis to Dallas for Porzingis and 2 firsts lotto protected is a solid deal.  Brogab to the Knicks for Quickley and a first.  Turner to the Pelicans for Adams and any 2 weak firsts.  Warren to Chicago for Patrick Williams and whatever salary matching.  Maybe a second.  Lavert to Memphis for Winslow and a protected pick.  Idk if they work salary wise but just spitballing.
"&gt; And what is the average rookie TS %?  The average I dunno, but here's the rest of the top 15 rookie scorers:  LaMelo 56%  Haliburton 59%  Cole Ant 49%  Quickley 56%  Bey 57%  Wiseman 55%  Maledon 50%  Patrick Williams 59%  Bane 60%  Okoro 52%  Pritchard 60%  Stewart 61%  Poku 41%  KMart 58%  So no, it's still not good. And that's without cherry picking the best parts of their seasons."
can Patrick Williams create his own shot? I haven’t seen much of him this season but I would’ve liked to see him shoot more than that
"Patrick Williams, Theo Macedon, Kira Lewis, Isaiah Stewart... he is literally one of the worst players in the NBA and there are plenty of guys his age performing way better."
Pass on em all and still get Patrick Williams
"The UnBearaBulls Podcast is a general sports podcast (NBA, NFL, MMA) with a Chicago flavor!  While we do talk about league-wide topics in most episodes, for this week's NBA segment(s) we only discuss the Bulls. Topics include- who is to blame? Is Patrick Williams developing well? What to expect for the closing weeks of the season?  [The episode can be found here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R3tkP97ksQ)  Outside of basketball, we also review the Jake Paul vs Ben Askren boxing event and the major trades affecting the NFL Draft's first round (Darnold, 49ers, Dolphins, Eagles)."
"You can't bench him because the Bulls roster is that bad. We started Patrick Williams who is lucky to score 6 points in 30 minutes. The next best SF after Valentine is Mokoka, who most people don't even know is an NBA player.  Bulls need a major overhaul. Vucevic was only step 1."
"Think out of the three Jarrett Allen is the least likely to leave his team. Would probably have to throw a near max at Jarrett Allen to get him out of Cleveland, and I think that's too much of an overpay. I think one of Markkanen/Collins are possible.   Markkanen more so because it looks like he's been moved to the bench and the Bulls are higher on Patrick Williams. Also I think Markkanen's fit with Siakam is better since he's a floor spacer and wouldn't clog the paint and Siakam does better in some areas of the game that Markkanen isn't really good at (rebounding and defense especially)."
Wiseman was literally the worst player in the league this season. Absolutely abysmal.   Is his ceiling technically higher? Sure.   But I’m betting on him being a bust and Patrick Williams being an effective player for a long career.
Patrick Williams.   He has a super high ceiling

"Mine is:             Lamelo, edwards, haliburton, bey, Tate first team  Quickley, cole Anthony, Patrick Williams, bane, Stewart second team"
"To be fair, Vooch has looked absolutely horrible on defense outside of Clifforts care.   Unless Patrick Williams will become the dpoy, you guys will be atrocious on defense.    Offense could use a real pg as well, Satoransky isn't bad but....meh"
"&gt;*and hae to pay Lonzo and Hart this summer*  No one has to pay anyone...  &gt;*Also stars have say where they want to be traded too and I dont think the Pels are a prime destination.*  We're not up shit's creek ***yet***.  We need some decent 8m guys to put around BI and Zion. Guys who can just hit the open shots our dudes generate. We need a young 3&amp;D Wing too. We tried to move up and grab Patrick Williams but it didn't work out.  The Nuggets can get a Gordon-level guy, despite not being LA or NYC. I think that's more the type of play level we need to aspire to. We need to start copying the hell out of their HW. Be competitive enough for some solid tier dudes to be interested.  And David Griffin needs to stop fumbling the bag with his roster construction.  If not, you lose your talent because talent wants to win and not waste their time, and that's 100% valid."
Hahahahaha.  Someone is a lil sensitive about Patrick Williams. I’m dead. Put your bum ass Luke Kornet on him again and he’ll fucking devour him. Put anyone on him and they’re getting lit up.   Y’all still have to make sure you make the playoffs with your sorry ass first half of the season.  I’m dead classic boston fan
Patrick Williams looks like the player that we really should have went for. Bulls got a steal.
"Poku, Antman, Lamelo, Killian Hayes, and Patrick Williams were one-year olds when LeBron got drafted"
"Idk why Anthony Edwards, Lamelo Ball and Patrick Williams all being born in the same month is kinda interesting to me but it is"
"Lots of people here clearly don’t watch the bulls. Zach lavine and vucevic have been good, their weakness on defense hasn’t been our problem. Vucevic, Theis, and Troy Brown jr have all been great pickups. Our problems are due to the fact that five players on our roster (Markkanen, Coby White, Thad young, satoransky, and Patrick Williams) have been absolutely useless when they had been decent or good earlier in the season"
"Can we clone Patrick Williams?  I don't know if the front office are gonna let Lauri walk, or use him in a sign-and-trade for a point guard that can run an offense. We desperately need someone who can shoulder the playmaking burden, White &amp; Lavine are better as score-first guards than they are at making plays for others."
And apperantly the entire basketball media. Don't worry Patrick Williams a 35 year old Nikola and Lavine with no draft picks will surely bring them championships in the future.
"Both of these articles reference the event, I've seen a couple of beat writers for the clippers mention it as well. Reggie was not playing well early in the year, and there was already a log jam at point guard. Ty Lue told Reggie to stay ready and when some injuries happened Reggie stepped in with whole new energy to how he played.   I remember those days with him on the Pistons, and even during his days on the Thunder when he would complain about his role versus Westbrook. He's come a long way in a short time; it's impressive to see. Playing on a veteran team probably helps too.  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-04-10/clippers-reggie-jackson-patrick-beverley-injured  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/ty-lue-met-with-lou-williams-reggie-jackson-and-luke-kennard"
"I never understood the reasoning behind this trade. You're giving up 2 picks and a young asset for Vooch. Best case scenario they would've been around the 6 seed (which is already out of reach now), and would've lost to the Bucks in 5 or 6 games. BUT Billy Donovan hasn't been able to figure it out, so they're just barely in the play in. Now what? They make the 7th or 8th seed and loose in 5 games to the Nets or 6ers?  This trade was a desperate floor raiser which fans reacted well to because they wanted to see some winning. Even if the Bulls go on a run now and make the playoffs it'll still be a bad move in my opinion.  Imagine two years down the line when Zach will be 28, Vooch will be 32, and you're still only a borderline playoff team. Your best bet now is to hope Patrick Williams becomes a star and you find a trade for lost causes like Coby White and Lauri for some draft capital.  Overall, this not how you approach a rebuild and it would've been waaay better to have your 2021 pick in a class as stacked as this one. Feel for yall Bulls fans..."
I don't think he will get anything significant to warrant that. the Bulls will not match him they want to sign other free agents and Patrick Williams will probably be their starting PF
Our players might actually not be that good. I'd personally be looking to blow up this iteration of the Bulls and build around Patrick Williams this summer. Maybe dick Orlando out of some picks with some lottery luck too.
I like Patrick Williams. Billy Donovan is overrated
" Coby White, Lauri, Patrick Williams"
"What assets do the Bulls really have to aquire a 3rd star? They don't have a 1st round pick next year and Markkanen's value has plummeted. Cobi White is a decent player, but I don't think he's got enough value to be the main trade chip in a deal for a player. Patrick Williams I think is going to be a very good player eventually, but right now I think he's too raw to really be the key piece in a deal either, plus I think the Bulls would rather hold onto him. Those are their best two pieces, but I don't think those 2 would be enough to fetch a star, plus with both guys still on their rookie deals, I don't know how they would get the salaries to match up. I don't really see a clear path for the Bulls to aquire another star."
Patrick Williams [Jimmy Butler] I see lots of Kawhi comparisons but I can honestly see him becoming more of a Jimmy Butler type player
"Oh yeah, Rui Hachimura and Patrick WIlliams are next! Both much better than Jackson tho"
"Top 10 rookies this season in no particular order: Edwards, Ball, Haliburton, Stewart, Tate, Patrick Williams, Saddiq Bey, Immanuel Quickley, Isaac Okoro, and Cole Anthony. I'd also potentially put Okeke, Campazzo, Wiseman, Bane, and Maledon above Flynn for their body of work so far.  Flynn's been great for a couple weeks, if he keeps it up until the end of the season maybe he cracks the All Rookie team ahead of someone like Quickley who doesn't have as much opportunity down the stretch."
"Lol if he’s this bad with Embiid, Harris and Curry. Is he gonna be better on the Bulls?  You’re better off developing Coby White, Patrick Williams and keeping Lavine and Vucevic"
"1997-98 Knicks with everyone in their prime would have been a problem  PG: Charlie Ward | Chris Childs  SG: Allan Houston | John Starks | Anthony Bowie  SF: Larry Johnson | Chris Mills  PF: Charles Oakley | Buck Williams | Terry Cummings  C: Patrick Ewing | Herb Williams | Chris Dudley  Terry and the two Williams's were probably about 567 years old combined that season, so if you get all three of them in their prime plus a healthy prime Ewing/LJ/Starks plus Anthony Bowie from that one night he had a triple-double, that team would have been a force"
Patrick Williams
Patrick Williams
"This allows them to keep Theis, slide Patrick Williams down and make a swing for a PG to complete the team. They're a good shout."
Can I just make the entire team besides LaVine and Patrick Williams available?
"I assume bulls protect Lavine, Vuc , Patrick Williams, Coby white, Thad Young, Troy brown Jr, Theis + Lauri ( if both re-sign) ."
Protect  -Patrick Williams  -Coby White  -Thaddeus Young  -Zach Lavine  -Nikola Vucevic   -Daniel Theis  -Troy Brown JR  - Tomas Satoransky
The Paw for Patrick Williams is one of my favorites
"Nah, Capela is what you get when Schroder fully evolves. You gotta evolve him to Patrick Williams first though."
"If what you mean is a late bloomer, then Patrick Williams"
Type of player I want Patrick Williams to turn into.
"Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams, Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Lebron James  Lebron instead of Vucevic cuz Vuc has proven he can be a championship number 1, Lebron can’t anymore needs AD"
"as a fellow bulls fan who watched most of our games I would have to agree. there were a few games and many moments throughout games where this bulls team looked really, really good. like borderline contender good. however, they are still way too inconsistent. some games only Zach shows up to play. also the most hot and cold shooting team I have ever watched. they gotta smooth out their game.  to me, next season will be won or lost on the shoulders of Coby white and Patrick Williams. we know lavine and vooch are gonna ball, but we really need Coby and pat to step up and contribute on both ends of the floor. obviously getting a PG will really help, but we need more from some of our current players too."
nah don’t worry.  Patrick Williams gonna win Finals MVP so we still good
That is if our boy Patrick Williams doesn’t win it
Patrick Williams
This probably doesn’t count but I’m like six months younger than Patrick Williams but put that man next to me you’d think he’s like 28
Patrick Williams
" &gt;Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.  You were owned by Golden State, Harden didn’t lack help, you were owned by Steph Curry.  Ya pre cp3. A lot of those guys weren't there at that time lol. And Lou for one season... pi tucker didn't become a decent shooter till much later."

Patrick Williams or John Collins
Hes a good offseason away from winning most improved player. His jumper looks more comfortable every time I watch them. He's what alot of people think Patrick Williams is.
Coby White? Lauri Markannen? Patrick Williams? Thad Young? I have no fucking clue.
who is patrick williams ?
Don’t forget Lauri Markkanen and Patrick Williams on the east
This playoffs has been all about the legion of Kawhi clones. Patrick Williams will have his time.
Hot take: Patrick Williams
Patrick Williams or Jaden
Patrick Williams aka the next Kawhi
"Patrick Williams would be my pick. He's flown under the radar this season, but he has legit D skills, he plays very hard on that end, he's got a serious combination of size/strength/speed, and he seems to *love* that end of the floor. He's going to be a problem for scoring wings for a long time in this league."
"Ant has improved a lot but he’s not the best defender from the class. From what I’ve heard, Vassell and Patrick Williams have been pretty good."
Facu reminds me of a shorter Patrick Beverly with Jason Williams-like passing. Facu is always hustling and always getting up in people's shit. He's improved his shooting recently too.
"I don't blame the kid. He's been injured a lot, his minutes and roles in offense and defense changed constantly so he never got comfortable. He has a lot of talent, though, and that's undeniable when you see him playing well. With a team that gives him minutes to regain confidence and help him play more aggresively he can become a really good player, but we currently have kind of a problem in minutes at the 4 (Thaddeus/Patrick Williams/Theis are viable options with more versatility or experience in some cases)"
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."

"There's value there.  Some people don't see it, but there's value. For Chris Paul walking, the Clippers got back Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, Dekker, and some G-Leaguer called Montrezl Harrell.  Felt like a bunch of random players at the time but Clippers found some value.  And at the time, the few guys the Clippers did get back didn't appear all that valuable to their current needs.  They turned out alright."
I think people underestimated just how quickly Lou Williams and Patrick Beverly both declined. Williams isn't even on a team any more and Beverly's barking doesn't match his quality of play.
"I could see that argument about Paul George or Patrick Beverly, but Lou Williams is pretty well liked throughout the league"
"When you have Zion, LaMelo, Ja Morant, and Patrick Williams getting considerable airtime."
"Haliburton has always been a bit of a high floor, low ceiling kind of player due to his physical attributes (average height, solid but unspectacular athleticism and skinny frame), age (he’s a year and a half older than guys like LaMelo, Ant, Patrick Williams, etc.), and lack of elite initiator skills. And teams at the top of the lottery are often hunting more for potential than current ability. The expectation was always that he’d be better out of the gate than a guy like Patrick Williams or Killian Hayes. The question was whether that would hold in 4 years."
Patrick Williams is like Jaden McDaniels. Which is okay expect one went fourth and the other went twenty eight.
Patrick williams
No. But they should’ve drafted Halliburton or Patrick Williams instead.
Patrick Williams doesn't eat breakfast
"I am down on the bulls future. Very down. I think its poor form for a franchise to really rely on free agency like Chicago is now. Theres definitely a chance for them to sign the missing players they need (like an NBA point guard), and a chance for Patrick Williams to take a step... but like, what if Lowry decides he wants to play for a proven contender, and if the pels decide to match? Who starts for Chicago at the 1 next year?    I think thats bad management, and that isn't getting better in 1 year (which is when Lavines contract is up)."
"we got a new one before this season. he brought in the veteran Garrett temple before the season and then traded at the deadline to get Vucevic, Theis, TBJ, and Aminu. He also drafted Patrick Williams in the draft.   Most of us agree with all of the moves he has made and are happy to have a front office that is trying to build a team. our previous front office never really did anything tbh. they drafted talent and not much else. we ended up with a team with a lot of talent that didn't mesh well together.  right now our new front office is still trying to untangle the mess that was left behind. we will have a better idea of how good they are after next season"
"Them picking Wiseman over LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Haliburton was such a fuck up. They'd probably be a 3-5 seed had they not."
"It's hard with so many free agents (Theis possibly staying, Markkanen definitely leaving, etc.) but I'd go with LaVine, Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Coby White and maybe Troy Brown Jr as our only players that matter."
Patrick Williams doesn’t deserve to be on an all rookie team

"Patrick Williams, Ant, Halliburton, Wiseman, Obi, LaMelo, Devin Vassel, BEEF STEW, RJ Hampton, Flynn and Bane are all going to be in the NBA as solid players, I think some combination of the first 6 I listed have a decent shot at being great"
Patrick Williams is so good
Vucevic finally stopped being a Nets killer only for Patrick Williams to become one
"Reasoning:   1. Cunningham is the surefire guy of this draft. You could argue other guys have more upside, but nobody has a higher floor. Cade will be an NBA starter, it's just a question of whether he'd be a third option, second option, or first option on a contender.  2. Green is the type of hyperathletic scoring guard that teams crave. He's the most likely in this draft to become the first option on a contender, in my opinion. He fits well with the Rockets rebuild, forming a dynamic duo with KPJ in the backcourt.  3. Mobley is a fascinating prospect who brings great perimeter skills in a big man's body. His post offense is worrying, and his lack of a shot is too, but his perimeter defense and driving ability as a seven footer make him a unicorn, even if those other skills don't develop.  4. Suggs is the purest PG in the draft, a classic ball handler who projects to do everything right, even if he lacks any one exceptional gift. He's a sizable point guard with no holes in his game. A very safe pick with long term upside. This guy might be Toronto's starting point guard for the next fifteen years.  5. Barnes fits that Patrick Williams mold, and if Williams can go 4th off the Seminoles bench, Barnes can do it as their most important player. He's a big, high motor wing who can lock down guards and has shown potential at the other end. Even if he doesn't develop his shot, he'll be a valuable wing for years to come.  6. Kuminga has the body, he has the athleticism, but his basketball IQ is horrible. He showed flashes of ball handling, shot creation, passing, and mid-range shooting, but his only positive talent right now is getting to the rim from a midrange spot. He's the definition of a boom or bust project pick, but his boom is big enough that he's worth betting on by a rebuilding team, similar to Poku last year.  7. Wagner here is probably going to be controversial. In my defense, John Hollinger at The Athletic and Deanondraft both agree with me. He's a big wing who can guard 1-4 and projects to be very above average at it in the NBA, rebounds well, passes surprisingly well (&gt;2:1 AST:TO), slashes well, and shoots FTs at an elite level for a 19yo, let alone a 6'9 forward. He projects to be a Kelly Oubre type with less hops and finishing ability, but more shooting and passing. He'll be a valuable player from day 1 as a teenager at a premium position, and has all the tools to become an exceedingly solid wing, if probably not ever an all star due to his lack of elite quick twitch muscle. As a final point, if you want to bring up his last game (where he wasn't great), I'll remind you he also outplayed Scottie Barnes in their March Madness matchup.  8. Moody is the most likely guy in this draft to become a plus 3&amp;D wing for the next fifteen years. Lots of Warriors fans want him, but I simply don't see him having the upside of Wagner. He slides into the Orlando roster, providing needed spacing and defense.  9. Johnson has a lot of question marks, but when he has it all together, he puts up crazy numbers. He can do it all. His shot may be questionable but he shows promise. He's the second biggest boom or bust prospect after Kuminga, in my opinion, and Sacramento needs to swing for the fences to get out of their current purgatory.  10. Bouknight has been flying up mock drafts, and I think he's a good pick, but a little overrated at this point. He has some major flaws despite his highlight play athleticism. His ball handling, shooting, and defense all need more work than I think most people recognize.  11. Keon is similar to Bouknight: some very promising signs at the shooting guard position, but a whole bunch of question marks as well. Not too much to say here, just a guy drafted for his potential.  12. Sengun has promise - Hollinger would say I have him way too low - and I get it: he's putting up good numbers in a really good league as a teenager, and such guys rarely fail in the NBA. However, he's a tweener, neither a PF nor a C, and he lacks the shooting that would cover for his deficiencies at either position. He could put it together and be a valuable big man, but he might end up getting run off the floor, too.  13. Giddey is another boom or bust guy, a huge point guard who can pass like crazy, but lacks the shooting or defense requisite for the position. He's young as hell, so it all comes down to a team's deep scouting on him. Can they fix his obvious flaws? If he develops right, he could end up being an amazing player. But that seems to be a long way off. A team like the Pacers, in that 8th seed purgatory, needs to take a gamble to get out, similar to the Nuggets with MPJ.  14. Kispert projects to be the best shooter in this draft, and his defense is actually pretty good. Was in the 25th percentile for lateral movement at the combine, FYI - I definitely had some bias against his defensive skills, picturing him as a lumbering (white) player. But he has the size and strength and shooting skill to be an elite floor spacer, and can drive better than you might imagine. There are questions around his shooting stroke being effective against NBA defense, but in all likelihood he'll be a good-if-not-great 3&amp;D player right out of the gate.   No Davion Mitchell, you ask? Yeah. I'm incredibly low on him. His FT% has declined each season in college. His first two collegiate seasons he shot about 30% from deep, then happened to shoot 45% his last year, without a corresponding increase to 2pt% or FT% - that's the definition of an outlier. Yeah he plays good defense, but his 6'0 height limits him on that end. At best he'll be a smaller Marcus Smart, which is wonderful, but very limited. And I don't think he gets to that level."
"Thanks man. I developed kind of a rubric for this coming season. Basically there’s four promising paths:   * Klay comes back 90%+  * Wiseman develops into a net positive center  * we hit on one draft pick   * we hit on the other draft pick  If one is true, we’re in the playoffs. If two are true, we make the second round. If three are true, we’re entering “borderline contender” status. If all four are true, we’re among the contenders.   Picture it from this past season: let’s say we add Klay at 18/3/2 on good splits, Wiseman plays more like Ayton (reg season Ayton, not postseason hero - averaging 14/10), and we get, say, Patrick Williams and Saddiq Bey (closest to 7,14 picks last year that really hit).   That team is 100% a contender. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/“Ayton”, Poole/Oubre/Bey/PatWil/Looney, Nico/Baze/Lee/Paschall/Chriss is fantastic"
"Lamelo, Poku, Antman, Patrick Williams, and Killian Hayes were 1-yr olds when Bron got drafted"
"I would honestly be shocked if Lavine is available. I would bet that Lavine, Vuc, and Patrick Williams are probably the only three who are relatively untouchable this off-season, but anything is possible and I’m just some guy so I could very easily be wrong."

Patrick Williams  Unlock Kawhi 2.0
"Idk he's a good defender, elite passer, was a good 3pt shooter last year. He's exactly the type of PG you'd want next to Lavine. If you can't convince big free agents to come over is it that bad to overpay slightly on a young guy that's a good fit?   Lonzo/Lavine/Vuc/another year of Patrick Williams should be at least a play in team for a few years, you start to put some veteran wings in there that looks interesting. And Lonzo's 25m salary is probably still very tradable if you're trying to put him in a package for a superstar one day."
This man wasn’t even on the select team. Patrick Williams and Keldon Johnson are way more deserving. We may not even get bronze 🥴
Patrick Williams literally had one earlier this year lol  The Bam and LeBron blocks were both better in recent memory too.
"Giannis really had to copy the goat, Patrick Williams, in order to generate just a few clicks. Sad."
Halliburton is a good defender. If you mean a bigger guy than Saddiq Bey or Patrick Williams could be good.
No way it's that given Patrick Williams is on the select team.
Patrick Williams hype!!!
"Bill Russell, Wilt, and [Patrick Williams?](https://youtu.be/QDzD8c5t0N8)"
Patrick Williams had a somewhat similar block on Ayton earlier this year. I think there’s a decent amount of guys in the league with the athleticism and instincts to pull this off. But Giannis just did it down 2-1 in the finals. The ability to step up in moments like that is what makes a legend.
I had a sixers fan wanting Lavine and Patrick Williams lol
"I saw a short video, but his form does look a little better and I think he has more confidence going into the season.  Vuc is not as athletic, but he could be a good partner.  I see Patrick Williams getting a lot out of lonzo."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"like a bunch of prospects are. patrick williams is incredibly raw and the Bulls took him at #4  Giannis was also playing professionaly, not against a bunch of kids way smaller than him (talking about HS draftees way back when)  and its very rare to see someone move like that with that body and even be able to dish out smart passes"
"Pick 4 last year (Patrick Williams) makes 7m, I assume it's somewhere around there.  33+19+16 for our core three, 68m.   Boucher 7, flynn 2, bembry 2, we're up to 79.   Gary is 4.5m, add pick 4 at 7m, so yea, we're up to 92.5, with around 20m in space, without bringing back lowry or any assets for him in a sign and trade. And without bringing back Paul, yuta or Stanley.  Our best bet is likely going to be to act as an ""above the cap"" team, because 20m in cap space doesn't get you much. I'd rather get assets for lowry and then use exceptions to sign guys."

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Breakout - Patrick Williams   Fall Off - Zion Williamson
"Two way wings:   Kawhi Leonard (All - NBA)   Jimmy Butler (All - Star)  Mikal Bridges (Role Player, with potential)   Patrick Williams (Rookie)"
"I'd say Patrick Williams is a pretty big piece of that young core, why no mention?"
Sign Lonzo if possible he fits incredibly well with Zach and the team  Trade or let go of Lauri cause he's useless with Vuc here   See if Coby makes any improvement and is worth being a core player cause him and Zach are pretty redundant  MORE PATRICK WILLIAMS MINUTES AND A BIGGER ROLE IN THE OFFENSE
"I wonder if Patrick Williams will get playing time.   Seems like we need help getting rebounds and being more physical.  Garland added some energy, however, it felt like we added more of what we already have with him."

"I don’t know how people sleep on this answer. He’s got one year left on his deal. The Bulls are in a weird spot when it comes to the playoffs in the east, unless they add another star this offseason, or one of their young players like Patrick Williams develops into that player. Why wouldn’t he be hesitant to request a trade to a contender and sign  long term there?"
Patrick Williams.
Patrick Williams
Kinda surprised Patrick Williams didn’t get the promotion
And Patrick Williams pls
"Just to scrimmage and practice against the A team.  Composed of mostly younger guys that has some upside like Herro, Patrick Williams, Naz Reid, Isaiah Stewart"
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
"Lifelong Bulls fan here. The trade definitely didn’t go as planned. They also gave up Gafford for a half season rental of Daniel Theis, who is a ufa and reportedly not interested in coming back, leaving a big hole off the bench at center.  Not much to do, but hope the off-season helps the team chemistry. AKME are obsessed with bigs, so it kind of looks like they are trying to recreate what they did in Denver and Philly. We have a big hole at pg, so a lot of rumors of trying to get Lonzo.   Lauri can walk, he’s a big disappointment and the team is hoping for a big jump from Patrick Williams. Definitely was a win now move that just didn’t work out. This next season will be the big test of the trade. It could still work Vuc is good."
"They'll make a move for a quality starting point guard, maybe Lowry or Lonzo. Beyond that I think they'll try to fill out the roster with a some quality role players in free agency and hope Patrick Williams develops his game more. They seem to want to win with Lavine."
"They need to develop Patrick Williams into an elite 3-D player. They probably should go after a defensive minded PG too and try to surround Lavine/Vucevic with 3-D players who don’t need high usage. Billy Donovan should also learn to stagger Lavine/Vucevic so they both are never off the floor in any competitive game. I honestly don’t think White will be part of their future plans. Same goes with Lauri but that’s more obvious. With that said, I think at best they make the 2nd round in the next 3-4 years."

MPJ is young KD except he needs to work on his handle and defense  KPJ plays alot like Harden   Patrick Williams and Deandre Hunter give off Kawhi vibes
"Yep, they missed the playoffs for 5 years and were in the process for 4 of those years. Part of the success was delayed because Embiid wasn’t healthy, otherwise the winning may have came earlier.   For comparison the Bulls have had 4 full seasons since Jimmy left and don’t have anyrhing to show for it from the draft except for maybe Patrick Williams."
As an OKC fan who is very invested in the Magic's pick (lol). I honestly don't think Barnes/Kuminga is a slam dunk obvious choice. Barnes has REALLY risen up draft boards ever since the college season ended and scout's really started diving into his tape. We saw the same type of rise with Patrick Williams last year.
"So basically what your saying is that if a player doesn't become a star in two years then the team should look to off load them and start over. Not like Lavine didn't become a 20PPG scorer until his 4th year in the league to this last year having the best statistical season of his career entering his prime. Coby and Patrick are both young and have the potential to improve their game just like every other player. Even if the Bulls decide to trade Coby for an upgrade at PG, a trio of Lavine, Vucevic, and the potential of Patrick is a good core to have, even knowing Lauri will potentially walk this year. Let's let them go a full season with Nikola, and a 2nd year Patrick Williams, before we start making assumptions that this team cannot contend,"
"The promised young core are all looking like role players at best, that's why excluding LaVine of course. They've shipped out WCJ and Gafford, Lauri might not even get a second contract from them, Coby White has stalled and he was always more of a scoring guard than a PG. Patrick Williams is the last hope and he's really raw and years away when LaVine's contract is up soon. They're also two picks down, one of which is a lottery pick (not that they've done well with them anyway). It's double or nothing for them, go all in or blow it up."
"I’m cool with trying to compete and not just relying on picks and the lottery but I also question if a borderline all star (barely top 30) good center who has some struggles defensively is worth an ok prospect and two firsts one of which is top 10. But we’ve done what we’ve done, so now we need to maximize LaVine and Vucevic and hope Patrick Williams is as good as advertised. We need a new PF, wing depth, and a new PG (Spencer Dinwiddie, Furkan Korkmaz, Bobby Portis is the dream but we probably can’t afford all of them unless we trade Thaddeus for a first, and find a way to dump Satoransky and Aminu)"
I'm big on Patrick Williams. I could see him turning into a better shooting Derrick Favors-type even if he doesn't become an all-star. Or maybe late career Paul Millsap. Depends which way his offensive and defensive games go.
"There's no rebuilding or retooling phase when you make that Vucevic trade. That's the roster, you build around it, try to maximize things as is. Doesnt mean its a potential title contender but who really cares just have a good team if things go right try to be a 4-5 seed for a a stretch. Just have to hope Vucevic and LaVine stay healthy. I am kind of out on Coby White though which isnt ideal for their long term trajectory. Like Patrick Williams but I also dont know if 3 yrs from now he'll really be a whole lot more than just a nice role player."
"Good, Patrick Williams just needs to take more shots and I’m happy"
Please Patrick Williams be the next Kawhi
"Time will tell, but at least the pick they gave up to Orlando isn’t in the top 5 of **this** draft. That would have stung.  I really like their decision to go with Patrick Williams at 4 last years draft. He’s got the tools to be a great wing player in this league, which is coveted in the NBA"
"If Dame wants out do the blazers blow it up completely?  Maybe the Blazers want young assets?  Disclaimer I realize this isn’t the best offer the blazers could get, but its just the best i think the Bulls can offer so i’m throwing it out there.  Bulls can offer:  Patrick Williams Coby White Troy Brown Jr Tomas Satoransky Al Farouq Aminu Future first?  Why the blazers do it:  Patrick Williams is a promising young player, a lotto pick and the 2nd youngest in the nba before the draft.  Star potential.  Coby is another player with star potential who may have been held back by playing next to Lavine.  TBJ is a sweetner as a decent young prospect and the rest are salary fillers   Why the Bulls do it: Sucks to trade Williams, but you can’t acquire superstars without giving up something.  Dame is a top pg in this league and you hope putting him next to Lavine and Vucevic is enough to become contenders.  You cut 4 mill salary with this move too so you can attempt to keep Thaddeus Young as a valuable glue guy and maybe re-sign Theis to become your starting PF."
Wendell and Patrick Williams don't play the same position.  That doesn't make any sense.
Them as a third team to take Simmons would be great for Chicago. A core of LaVine Simmons Patrick Williams and Vucci Mane fits great together
Wendell isn’t bad. But trading him frees more minutes for Patrick Williams. I think they made the trade just to keep Lavine happy 🤷
"Your reasoning for Lavine doesn’t make much sense.!He doesn’t have a reason to leave, nor has shown interest IN leaving. He’s gonna have a full season of Vucevic and Patrick Williams will be a beast"
Patrick Williams and Miles Bridges 👀
Patrick Williams was impressive this year too
"Depends on your team and the fit. For the Bulls, OG would be perfect next to Zach at the 2 and Patrick Williams at the 4. JC couldn’t be bad either on the Bulls, he could play the 4 next to Vuc and PWill could shift to the three. I’d take OG"
Patrick Williams
"Jamal and Dejounte Murray!  Then like Darius Bazley, Terrance Davis, Taurean Prince, and WCS. Qickley, Maxey, and Patrick Williams as rookies.  So... you can go real young + Kawhi, or very Murray + Kawhi."
"I'm shocked no one has said the bulls. The players we drafted in our rebuild are not what we expected (still too early to tell with Patrick Williams). We have vucevic who is 31, Zach lavine is a free agent next year. If we don't show that the team is good enough to compete next season he could very well choose to leave, sending us back 4 years. Id be lying if I said this doesn't keep me up at night."
"I still think Patrick Williams will be a star, give AKME 3-4 years to build around em"
"Off the top of my head of guys who actually get some minutes: Conley, Garland, Sexton, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Shroder, Conley, Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  And there's a lot more, but i don't want to google it."
"Rajon Rondo, Lou Williams, Dennis Schroeder, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverly, Darious Garland, Devonte Graham……. Plenty of guys. The hawks have had 3 guys of these guys on our team alone"
"Hunter, OG or the PAW (Patrick Williams) all have similar playing style with Kawhi"
"Bruh. Look up all the managerial work done by the Atlanta Hawks who started a rebuild around the same time as Cavs did about 3-4 years ago. That's how you build a team. Heck even Chicago has done better with a mix of stars like LaVine and Vucevic along with all that nice young talent such as Patrick Williams was an excellent pick, way better than Okoro. Cavs as is are in bad shape compared to the rest of the NBA unless they make better moves"
Patrick Williams
"Not the worst trade I’ve ever seen, but Derrick White will be 27 next year and has an injury history. He doesn’t match the Magic’s timeline at all, especially with Hampton/Fultz/Anthony at the guard spots.  I personally think this draft is a crapshoot outside of the top four guys. Kuminga is wildly raw, not at all a sure-fire prospect and much more raw than Patrick Williams was last year. I don’t think he’s a prospect worth trading up for."
"You shouldn’t be. I know it sucks, but I think you guys will be a playoff team next year. You gotta start winning for Zach to wanna stay and you already have your foundational piece along with Patrick Williams and Vucevic. If you can get a point guard in free agency, you’ll be in a good spot"
"Hello, Chicago fan with the the 6th pick three years in a row and last year we took Patrick Williams at 4. Shame on me for thinking we’d get lucky again like we did with D-Rose"
"That's not all the way fair. Morey only traded for 2 established superstars in his tenure w/the Rox, CP3(awesome) and Russ(not awesome). D12 was a free agent, and Beard wasn't a superstar when we traded for him. So which players did he trade that you cared about so much, and which superstar did you not want?  Unless you're yearning for the days of the post-TMac/Yao era of the treading water Rox, then you can't hate on the Harden trade at all if you even want to count that one. FWIW I loved Scola, Brooks, KMart, Chuck, KLow, Dragic, etc.  1. In order to get CP3, Morey traded Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations. I still adore Pat Bev and Trezz, and I got love for LouWill, but that CP3 trade led to the greatest non-Hakeem led team in franchise history. It's undeniable that trade was amazing, and even if you hate CP3, it was the best move for the team. I cared more about team success at that point than how much I missed Pat Bev and Trezz, and I became a CP3 fan.  2. I agree with you on the Russ trade tho, and I hated it in real time but tried to stay positive. We all saw how that worked out, and I still miss CP3. But that trade was on Frittata and Harden 100%, and I can't be convinced Morey wanted Russ especially at the cost of those picks. It is what it is, but Morey makes moves to get better, and he's generally on point unless the owner is a cheap bastard who takes out $200 million loans at like 35% lmao"
2022: Nikola Vucevic   2023: Zach Lavine   2024: Lauri Markkanen   2025: Coby White   2026: Patrick Williams
"Not gonna ruin your dreams, Simmons will totally get you that chip. Just send along Patrick Williams and a couple pick swaps and we'll figure something out"
I could see Lonzo getting something in the 20+ range. Him on Chicago would be fun. Just seeing Lavine with someone else to get other people involved and him as just a gunner on offense is what I've been hoping for them to get for ages and it's too bad Sato didn't work out. I hope this happens.    Chicago still has the potential to be really fun next season. I still don't know what Patrick Williams is but sign me up for the ride
Who would Philly accept from Chicago for Simmons? Patrick Williams and Coby White don’t get it done.
"I dont actually think Chicago has what the sixers need. Like if youre willing to put Coby White or Patrick Williams in the deal we can talk about Sato+salary filler, but other than that I think Rubio+Beasley+stuff from Minnesota is a lilely outcome."
BI is an all star and on a long contract.   You ain't selling him for Patrick Williams lol and the Bulls are short on picks as is.
"Hard to overstate how dominant Barkley's 2P% was during his prime.

How good will Patrick Williams be if he starts in the future?
Patrick Williams a future HoFer
"idk there’s always those team that come around, Wizards, Bulls if they offered Patrick Williams+pick(s), maybe even the Warriors if they made a real offer"
"It sucks because he had less time to put up numbers. Advanced stats wise he’s clearly a top ten rookie but all the rookies besides Quickley (who I think should clearly be on the team regardless) averaged 20 or even 30 minutes per game.  In Pritchard’s 28 games with at least 20 minutes he averaged 11.8/4.2/2.8 with 1.1 turnovers and .8 steals on 49.4/46.2/90 (120/243 from the field, 62/134 from 3, and 27/30 from the line) or a ts% of 64.2%.    Okoro averaged over 30 minutes and had a stat line of 9.6/3.1/1.9 with 1.3 turnovers .9 steals and .4 blocks on 42/29/72.6 or 51.4% ts    Patrick Williams put up 9.2/4.6/1.4 and 1.4 turnovers .9 steals and .6 blocks on 48.3/39.1/72.8 or a 53.4% ts    Bane had 9.2/3.1/1.7 with 0.9 turnovers 0.6 steals on 46.9/43.2/81.6 or 60% ts    Stewart has 7.6/6.7/0.9 and 1 turnover .6 steals and 1.3 blocks on 55.3/33.3/69.6 or 59.7% ts"
"Patrick Williams is the next Kawhi, not really but I mean it would be cool if he was, ya know?"
Patrick Williams would have been awesome. He’s already a good complimentary player and could grow into more.
"Fair but with a whole offseason to gel, plus Lonzo and Demar, and Patrick Williams (expected) development after already looking solid, I think anything under 45ish wins would really surprise me with this team. But you’re right they were surprisingly pretty bad after the trade"
Patrick Williams. He gonna benefit a ton with the new aquisitions
"Bulls OVER 41.5, I don’t see how a team with 3 really good players in Vuc, Demar and Lavine goes under .500. Plus expecting a really nice year from Patrick Williams and Lonzo. Might have to put some money on that."
"And for the front court you have a competent big man like Vucci Mane and rising young blood Patrick Williams. Bulls FA, drafting and trades over the last 2 years built this nice team. I expect playoffs for sure."
Patrick Williams not getting any love out here?  Keldon Johnson with DeRozan gone and a lot more shots that need to be taken makes the most sense among these though
"Yeah we have 2 JMacs.   Honestly JMac already has a higher PER and more winshares than Okoro based off their rookie seasons. Okoro played more MPG but part of that was just because early in the season Jaden was only a garbage time player. Once we hired an actual coach Jaden was starting and our season was turning around hard at the end.   Jaden followed up a great end of his season  with an even better summer league, including putting the clamps on Patrick Williams and hitting a game tying 3 with seconds left on the clock vs the 6ers.   He still needs to put on more muscle, but he did add like 15lbs of muscle over the offseason, but he could easily be a dominant 3 and D player in the league. Think RoCo with a less streaky shot."
I'm curious to see Patrick Williams v. Zion.
"For  Bulls it could have been SGA, mitchell,Siakam, Patrick williams and Pj washington For Magic  Sabonis, Mitchell, SGA, Brandon clarke N saddiq bey"
"Agreed that Houstons defense is a giant issue, but I think Toronot will be alright defensively, not elite.   I'd say OG slightly edges out the group you mentioned for having the best impact, followed by KPJ, Gordon, Trent Jr, and then Tate.  GTJ is definitely not a better player than KPJ or EG.  Barnes shows potential, but I see his rookie year being kind of like Patrick Williams, but a bit lesser.  I do not think Precious is that good. I see him as a lower end backup big.  Dragic staying does add a big boost though, I just don't see it happening."
You don't think a season with healthy Lavine and Vucevic you would have anyways? From where I sit you will end up in the same place anyways but with no financial flexibility and less room for Patrick Williams to grow into.
"Almost everyone on the Bulls I think  1.	Lonzo - still young, has improved every year 2.	Lavine - Has improved every year, coming off olympic run 3.	Derozan?- Questionable, but coming off his best season in regards to efficiency and playmaking. Will possibly lose a step athletically though 4.	Patrick Williams - just turned 21, self explanatory  5.	Vucevic?  Currently in his prime.  Not sure when his fall off will be."
"More then anything its indicitive of how little known Jaden is outside of the Wolves-sphear. I only watched Patrick Williams play once, but Jaden was pretty clearly the better player when they went h2h."
I wouldn’t call them a big 3 but I will call them a great starting 5 on paper.   PG : Ball  SG : LaVine  SF : Patrick Williams  PF : DeRozan  C : Vuc  On paper that’s a great starting 5.
"that’s called being overpayed, you’ll be shocked when Demar, Zach and even Patrick Williams handle the ball more than Lonzo. he’s a point guard but can’t do things a point guard can do, how does that make any sense"
Patrick Williams’ stat line looks like it belongs to an all-star big man.
"&gt;Andre Drummond  Going to have to respectfully disagree on that one, though it's a common refrain.   If anything, I always thought Andre was super fortunate to be playing in today's NBA, where the paint is emptier than it's ever been and where teams play spread small ball, allowing him some of the most unobstructed rebounding lanes in post-merger history.   Moreover, in the age of the spread pick-and-roll, that dude's been able to average over 16 points per game despite having one of the worst offensive skills sets I've ever seen out of an all-star center... ever. Guy just gets to feast one point blank alley-oops and tip-ins (often from on the aforementioned pick-and-roll).   Andre Drummond in the 1990's or prior is in trouble. Suddenly he's not just warding off Myles Turner for his rebounds, he's dealing with Antonio Davis &amp; Dale Davis, not to mention a rebound-hungry Otis Thorpe and Jerome Williams on his own side, all crammed into the paint at once, vying for that rock.   And without the prevalence of the spread pick-and-roll, I'm not really sure how that dude's scoring in the 90's or prior because no team in their right mind would give that dude more than a couple of post touches per game. And instead of running into a Rudy Gobert or Joel Embiid a few times a year, it's not hard to imagine Andre getting very lost among the shuffle of Shaq, David, Hakeem, Patrick, Rik, Rony, Vlade, and Dikembe."

Patrick Williams
"Nah, a lot of the same issues they've always had, it's just now they're more experienced.    If they do become that, it might hinge on Patrick Williams becoming a legitimate stopper to combine with Lonzo.  That type of high level perimeter defense (if they get it) can be a foundation to build on.  Might also need to use a Coby white trade to buttress their offensive stars with more 3nD and rebounding.  White could be a microwave 6th man scorer, but i just think his organizational role is too confused after being drafted as a foundational piece and getting kicked around in a few different regimes.  Prolly best to restart somewhere else."
"Patrick Williams, Michael Porter Jr, and this one may be controversial but if Coby White goes to a place where he can be a first option and primary ball handler he can be VERY good. once his develops his playmaking and consistency shooting the ball he could be a Trae Young type player"

"Oh I don’t think he will be Draymond at all I agree it’s a lazy comparison, but there’s a spectrum with Draymond on one end and Giannis at the other that I think Barnes falls somewhere on. Closer to Green it’s more about defense playmaking and incredible basketball IQ. Towards Giannis it’s more physical domination and scoring upside. (Talking purely upside here of course)  I will disagree on Kawhi though, he clearly showed way more polish imo when you look at Kawhi in college and in workout videos he has a great handle, textbook shooting form, stiffness and awkwardness for sure but not the baby horse learning to walk level bloopers you occasionally see from Barnes. the other FSU guy, Patrick Williams, is a bit more reminiscent of Kawhi to me."

Yeah that's why I didn't say Patrick Williams seems like a lot of people are aware of your potential and who you are when you're a top 5 pick

Patrick Williams!! The kid is going to be special. I %100 believe he’s a future all star and will make all defensive teams

"I like both guys, but Patrick Williams - I think he's gonna have a monster sophomore season. He's much more advanced than Scottie offensively, and pretty close defensively. We will see how Scottie goes in the regular season, but I think it will be at least a couple years before he's not a massive liability on offense. Scottie has a massive range of outcomes, and it wouldn't be super surprising if he was a guy that flirts with double digit points his whole career.  I could see PWill average 20 - 25 ppg at his peak."
Patrick Williams will achieve the same heights as prime Kawhi. Mark my words baby!
Patrick Williams
Patrick Williams. Scottie Barnes still has no actually NBA experience yet.
"I’m super curious too lol. He’s either putting Patrick Williams, Lauri Markennan, Coby White, or Alex Caruso ahead of Lonzo, which seems wrong until proven otherwise."
Before this last season I would have definitely said Jrue.  I'd like if the answer to this question became Patrick Williams by the end of the season.
1. Anthony Edwards 2. Jonathan Kuminga 3. Patrick Williams

"(I like 20% believe this but want it to be true so bad) Patrick Williams is going to come out this year looking like 14-15 Jimmy Butler with a better 3 point shot and more strength down low, elevating the Bulls to a 2 seed and a 7 game ECF with the Nets."

Ehh that bench is thin.  They unlike most teams can't survive an injury.  Like outside of Caruso no one on that roster can step up.  God forbid Vuc misses time because then they are even more screwed.  Also I'm concerned with how Derozan effects their offense.  They are relying a lot of Patrick Williams becoming a good spot up shooter.  Like are we taking the ball out of Lavine's hands for Derozan.  I'm not so sure this will be as smooth as people think.
"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."

Lauri is way too good to go overseas just yet. He hasn't had a fair shot in the league with the Boiled Egg and having to compete for time against Thad Young and Patrick Williams. Lauri needs a proper shake before we can write him off. Send him to a team that fits better and can properly develop him before calling him a bust.
"Boston was also one of a very small number of teams where the most games played were by a rookie and the only one where the most games played were by a rookie who didn’t make an all rookie team.  It was us with Pritchard, the Bulls with Patrick Williams, the Cavs with Okoro, the Pistons with Bey, the Wolves with Edwards, and the Rockets with Tate."
I agreed with you for the most part until the Bulls hired Karnisovas. They have been so utterly bad for so long and within a couple seasons has made hires and trades that will most probably take them to the playoffs. Drafting Patrick Williams was a bit of a head scratcher considering who was available but he’s shown some great promise thus far.
Patrick Williams is fat
Zach Lavine is the best player ever. Coming in at a close 2nd is Patrick Williams
"Terance Mann, Nickeil Walker-Alexander, Rui Hachimura (he’s gonna be amazing tbh), De’Andre Hunter, Lonnie Walker, Cole Anthony, Patrick Williams, And Jaren Jackson Jr (I already think he’s good but he’s going to put people on notice)."
Patrick Williams
LaMelo was 3rd. Patrick Williams was 4th.
"I think it made a lot of sense for them to get Lonzo, and his contract will age well. I also think Caruso made a lot of sense for them as a point of attack defender.   I do question how much they can improve the defense because only one will play at a time and they're going to be playing next to Zach Lavine.  The main thing that bugs me about their moves is that they have to put out a bad defensive lineup to get their best players on the court.   Between having DeMar at the 3 who can't guard any position, Vucevic at the rim who is pretty much only good in drop coverage because of how bad he is in space, and Lavine, who tries but has never been an effective defender, there are just too many places to attack in a playoff series, and they're asking for a ton from Patrick Williams."
I'm not sure any of these guys are future all stars.     If I had to pick 1 it would be Patrick Williams
"bulls are the spiciest team in the league. could see this lineup clicking and running the fucking table. a lineup of vooch, patrick williams, demar, lavine and ball is nasty. honestly could see them cracking the top three in the east (milwaukee, philly, brooklyn) depending on health.  also could see them 10th. nyk, boston, miami, toronto, hawks, charlotte, pacers, are all potentially stronger than chicago."
"Top 5 best chances, in order (imo):    1. Lonzo Ball 2. RJ Barrett 3. Jaren Jackson Jr. 4. Patrick Williams 5. Collin Sexton"
"Guys I think will be all stars  JJJ, KPJ, RJ, Hunter and Patrick Williams  Outside of Hunter, these guys are all 21 or younger  Lonzo and Isaac will be on All NBA defensive teams"
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Patrick Williams hasn't even turned 20 yet (although he does in a couple weeks). So he's not even as old as some of these summer league guys. Being in the NBA doesn't magically make you good. You still only get 365 days in a year and 24 hours a day. You get good by spending time working out and practicing. And you can do that without being in the NBA.
The bulls won 2016 summer league championship with Denzel valentine and Felicio killing it lmao.....chill bro  Patrick Williams didn't play well and he was on the Olympic reserves and NBA starter.... summer league isn't going to tell you who is NBA ready from one game
"I'm aware of Tony Bradley from his stint in Philadelphia and I don't think he's moving the needle. I saw ayo dosunmu play and I like his game I don't think he's going to see a lot of minutes and now that they have Lonzo Ball it should open up Coby Whites game up he's a pretty good three level scorer and can give you points coming off the bench or in a small ball lineup which I think we're going to see a lot of.  And I think you missed the point about the bulls needing a inside shot blocking presence that Gafford would have given them.  Because they are not getting any of that from Troy brown while he may have a higher upside than Gafford but how does that help them when you have a log jam at perimeter wing players with Patrick Williams, and Zach lavine, DeMar DeRozan there only so many minutes and how many can they find for him 12 to 15 a game tops?"
"True as long as you have players with specific skillsets.  I think you can make an entire team out of guys 6 foot 5 to 6 foot 9.  Heres an entire starting 5 of 6’6 guys.  PG: Lonzo SG: Lavine SF: Mikal Bridges PF: Zion C: Draymond  Also for better or for worse the Bulls starting 5 coming up is basically all wings + Vucevic lol  Lonzo, Lavine, Derozan, Patrick Williams, Vucevic"
"I love Patrick Williams, but I've been so damn annoyed since draft day that LaMelo couldn't fall one more spot.  Although obviously if we got LaMelo, we likely wouldn't have had interest in Lonzo."
"Patrick Williams would have to improve a lot, but if he starts to live up to his defensive potential he'll have a lot of eyes on him on a resurgent Bulls team, and his defense will really stand out when he's on the floor with LaVine, DeRozan, and Vuc lol. I think LaVine can be average if he wants to, and Vuc not terrible, but even Ball isn't a great on ball defender - Williams could really be highlighted on a newly winning team."
Did Patrick Williams die?
Patrick Williams frfr🔥
"I agree with everything you said.  I think Vuch is a slightly above average defender. I think people assume his defense is below average because his offense is so good (if that makes sense?) and he doesn't make highlight plays on defense. His defensive rebounding is the thing that makes him go from an average defender to a slightly above average defender.  However, he isn't a true rim protector, which is what you need to make up for poor exterior defense. Funny that you mention Isaac, because I think he would the perfect PF to put next to Vuc to help compensate for both Lavine and DeRozan. Isaac can do some big time shot blocking at the rim in a way Vuc can't. I don't think Patrick Williams is that guy, so it will be a bit rough.  It's really going to all depend on if Billy Donovan is creative enough in his offensive scheme to properly use these guys, and in addition, adjust the gameplan according to the matchup each game.  This roster is offensively the dream of a coach who likes to think outside the box... correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that is what Billy is known for? He is a great coach, but doesn't seem like an odd-ball innovator like D'antoni or Steve Kerr.  If we play some generic offensive scheme that Billy pulled out of the coaching handbook, we are destined for mediocrity. If he takes some risks and tries to concoct something tailored to this roster, we could really upset some teams despite the defensive woes."
"For Bulls - Patrick Williams  That is all - he will be in the discussion for 2nd team all defense this year since his offensive role will likely remain the same all things considered and he was already an above average defender next year.  Agreed with what you said about Lavine though - over the past year and a half he's focused on defense/passing and has improved a lot, with a lesser offensive role he'll prob be about average on D. Good on ball, prob still not great off it"
"ATL - Dominque Wilkins Boston - Larry Bird Brooklyn - KD Charlotte - Rex Chapman  Chicago - Jordan  Cleveland - Mark Price Dallas - Dirk Denver - Melo Detroit - Isiah Thomas GSW - Chris Mullin Houston - Hakeem Indiana - Reggie Miller LAC - Sam Cassell LAL - Kareem Memphis - Jason Williams Miami - Glen Rice Milwaukee - Giannis Minnesota - Andrew Wiggins New Orleans - Zion New York - Patrick Ewing OKC - Harden Orlando - Shaq Philly - Barkley Phoenix - Cedric Ceballos Portland - Damian Lillard Sacramento - Peja Stojakovic San Antonio - David Robinson Toronto - Damon Stoudamire Utah - John Stockton  Washington - Moses Malone  This was fun. Some guys popped in my head from playing NBA Jam, and others from dunk contests."
"The 2017 warriors   Curry (2x Mvp) Klay  (all star HOF) Iguadala (all star, finals MVP) Durant (MVP, 2xFMVP)  Dray (all star, defensive player of the year)  David West (all star) Livingston Pre Leg Injury was a STUD Nick Young  Javale  Chris Boucher  Patrick mccaw 3 time champ (lmao)   But I think #1 sleeper is 2013-2014 nets   Deron Williams (all star) Joe Johnson (all star) Pierce (all star, fmvp) KG (mvp, DPOY) Brook Lopez (all star)  Jason Terry (6 man of year, clutch underrated) Andre Kirilenko (all star, all nba defense) Livingston   That team would be insane in their prime"
Patrick Williams
"Bulls look really good.  Vuc and Lavine were allstars this year. Demar played at an allstar level this year, but didn't make the cut because of team record/small market, and Patrick Williams is projected to be a future allstar.  Lotta fire power there."
"I don't think Derozan and Patrick Williams are liabilities defensively. If anything, it's their interior defense with Vucevic. This reminds me of how everyone thought the Nets would have the same issues defending, but reality is that they were fine once all players' defensive effort levels go up in the playoffs."
"I'd trade Patrick Williams, Coby White, and Lauri Markannen for him.  I'd take that starting 5 of Ball/Lavine/Demar/Simmons/Vuc"
"I was going to say the Bulls. With Zach, DeMar, Lonzo, Vuce, Patrick Williams, Alex Caruso.. that's an East playoff team, and should give other playoff teams a good challenge."
"People keep with this “Talent over Fit” stuff and I don’t know what they are looking at. The Bulls needed someone to help run offense in the half court (Ball is a big upgrade overall but that’s not his game), someone who can drive and get to the line (we were dead last at free throw attempts last year, 17.5. Only 3 other teams were under 20), and play the 3, to move Patrick Williams to his more natural 4. DeRozan was a 7 assist per game player last year (with a 3.5 A/T, as well), gets to the free throw line at an elite rate, and helps transition Williams.  Yes, he’s not a good defender (which is a legitimate problem) and yes he can’t shoot the 3 (Not as big of a problem: Lavine, Vic, and Ball between them shot about 22 3s a game last year, at a collective of about 40%, and having DeRozan facilitate for them could be huge for all of them), but the fit still is a pretty easy positive imo."
I’d argue this is great for Patrick Williams. Coby gets his chance to be the lead man off the bench as well. Neither of our young guys are really hindered from this
Never had to play a team as bad as the pacers? He had steph Klay and Dray and got taken to 6 by Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams lmao
"Here were the players drafted ahead of JJ in the 2006 NBA Draft:  1-Andrea Bargnani  **2- Lamarcus Aldridge**  3-Adam Morrison  4-Tyrus Thomas  5-Shelden Williams  *6-Brandon Roy*  7-Randy Foye  **8-Rudy Gay**  9-Patrick O'Bryant  10-Mouhamed Sene  &amp;#x200B;  The players that ended up being better than JJ (imo) are bolded.  Although I hesitate to put Rudy Gay ahead of him because of the playoff appearance discrepancy.  Brandon Roy is italicized cause he had a higher ceiling than JJ, but it was never actualized due to injury.  For a few years (2007-2011), JJ Redick was considered a bust, and people were quick to label him that given his reputation at Duke.  But he turned it around mostly with a super great work ethic, falling into the ""white guy tries hard"" athlete stereotype.  His consistency and impact on a game are uniquely spectacular.  I don't think that being on 13 straight playoff teams was a coincidence; those teams were good because his off-ball movement added a dimension to the team's offensive game.  After a weird start to his career, which included an injury, DWI and abortion contract, his fortune seemed to turn around in 2009 during the Magic's surprisingly deep playoff run.  He played a good series against the Celtics and his future head coach Doc Rivers, who would appoint him the starting 2-guard of the Clippers in the following years, was the opposing coach in that series.  The mid 2010's Clippers are historically overrated in the sense that they should have won a title.  That is mostly because they never made a conference final.  I am a Warrior fan and I feel strong about this.  Their roster was sick though, and it was fun to watch them.  The last point I want to make about JJ is that he was kind of a cultural icon for white basketball players around 2003-2006.  Many (white) players sported buzzcuts on the AAU circuit those summers, wore ankle socks and worked on their jumper."
I like this guy. Patrick Williams underrated!!!
"&gt;	Five years later, when Paul forced his way to Houston, Morey merely surrendered Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverley and a future first-round pick.  the author should learn what a free agent is"

1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
"You want some reasons as to why it's so bad?  \- Boucher is a PF, and he definitely won't be starting at centre for us, which just proves how little you know about this team  \- Birch is a solid centre, definitely a guy you'd prefer to have off the bench, but despite what you ""believe"", he can and has contributed well on both sides of the floor. You also gave no reasons as to why you believe he can't  \- You gave literally 0 reasons as to why OG isn't at least a top 5 3+D player in the league... I mean he shot 40% from 3 last season and if you watch him play, which I'm going to assume you haven't much, he's definitely an elite defender  \- Scottie is a completely different player to Patrick Williams, so I'm not sure where that came from.  So just try and give some actual thoughtful reasoning and do some proper research next time you do one of these, otherwise you're just kind of making a fool out of yourself"
"G: Payne G: Maxey F: Patrick Williams F: Desmond Bane C: Daniel Gafford  Tried to account for some defense with Williams and Gafford, probably not a playoff team but could be interesting"
Billy Donovan is defensive minded coach it will be main task for him this season but Bulls is in the top 20 defense for years even with worse defensive rosters.  Bulls really had trouble last year with defending rival ballhandlers in both half court. Transition defense was terrible because of Coby just can't defend anyone. Now we have Ball and Caruso in the roster both of them can defend main ballhandler in perimeter. Lavine's defensive improvements were one of the least talked storylines of the last season as well. And also Bulls are loaded with one-way defensive wings in the bench unit. Perimeter defense won't be problem as long as Derozan don't defend the main perimeter threat.   Bulls defense having troubles in the post since they lost Robin Lopez as well. Giving rival teams most offensive rebounds in the league didn't helped them as well. But Vucevic is one of the better rebounders in the league without Markkanen and Carter Jr's rebounding problems and having Ball and Derozan gonna help them as well about rebounding. Bulls won't be great defensive team or anything but until playoffs I don't think they will be bottom 10 teams. If Donovan cover Vucevic's post defense with drop defense and use Patrick Williams and Zach Lavine as help defender atleast they can limit the pain.
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
"The Chicago Bulls may have recently brought in a lot of elite new talent (DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso) to the already promising squad of Zach LaVine, Patrick Williams and Nikola Vučevič, but I think it will take some time for them to establish chemistry and flow well together. Also, we need a good Center. I wanna be hopeful for their upcoming season but I also have to be realistic."
Patrick Williams is two years away.
Yeah Patrick Williams just hasn’t yet realized his potential as an all time great. It will come eventually.
“Guess how much DeBallZach dropped last night?”  “DeBallZach really came through on D and turned it into O”  “Patrick Williams’ boxer mentality has him playing hard D so DeBallZach isn’t exposed”
Ja Morant   Jalen Green   Mikael Bridges   Patrick Williams   Victor Wembanyama  And I keep the $30
Two things. Why do you think Patrick Williams is arguably not good offensively and why will they be a bottom defensive team when even last year they were average with worse players?
"I feel confident the Bulls will be a playoff team this year. My only concern is that they sacrificed draft picks and cap flexibility to win now with 32-year-old DeMar DeRozan and 30-year-old Nikola Vucevic, who are fine players but aren’t LeBron and AD or Durant and Harden.   They are gambling hard on major improvements from 26-year-old Zach LaVine, 23-year-old Lonzo Ball and 20-year-old Patrick Williams. It sounds to me like a playoff team, maybe even a second round playoff team, but not an Eastern Conference Finals team."
"Championship - speak it into existence! More likely a first round exit but I can’t stand the people saying we gave up our future to be perennial first round exits. We kept Coby White, who averaged 15/4/5 on 40/35/90 shooting splits in his second year!!! We kept our prized possession: Patrick Williams, who we’re banking on to succeed just like any other team with young talent. We picked up young prospects who still have the potential to be something in this league such as Tony Bradley, Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr. etc...we have two first round picks this year (our own! and Portland’s lottery protected FRP). This isn’t me just drinking the Kool-Aid, we’ve been rebuilding for awhile now and it wasn’t working so the new FO said fuck it, we’re going to compete and build a team around Lavine, who we believe has superstar potential, while also keeping a solid young core intact to fall back on if this iteration of the team fails."
"&gt; Forgot we got monta in the 2nd my bad! Honestly thought we got him as a free agent since our drafting was so bad hah  Nellie's signature was finding 2nd rounders and UFAs. Every year he'd have some Anthony Morrow or Kelenna Azubuike or Marc Jackson come out of nowhere, while the Patrick O'Bryants and Ike Diogus flopped.   Sometimes a Reggie Williams would show up and average 20 for a couple months, then just disappear back into thin air."
"He is actually good for you guys. Ball, Lavine, demar, coby, Vuc, Caruso, Patrick Williams, DJJ, Arcidiacono, Stanley Johnson etc   That’s a pretty damn good team, Bulls will be fun next year. Probably not better than the bucks-Nets-sixers but they will be like the 4-6th seed"
"Stanley, derozan, Patrick Williams, djj, Troy brown jr, javonte green, and I think one more I’m forgetting"
"Ok Ok... but have you seen at Patrick ""The Paw"" Williams. My guy is the next Kawhi  Not even joking, has tons of potential"

"I'm not intimately familiar with the Bulls, I'll gladly admit, and I was unfamiliar with Patrick Williams at the time I made the comment. Before being certain of their success, I would like to see how they do- the Hawks can really only get better, the Bucks and Nets will still be dangerous, Heat have improved, and I hardly know what to think of the Sixers. Either way, I like to root for teams without a super star, and I like Vucevic and Derozan, so I hope you guys do really well this year."
Patrick Williams.
"Patrick Williams. Don’t get me wrong I love LaVine, but obviously if we are offered another superstar I’d consider it. PWill is different because I absolutely love his game, he’s incredibly young, and I truly think he has potential to dominate this league"

Patrick Williams is going to go back down to Earth on offense. He cooled off hard second half of the season and I think he may follow that trend.
I wouldn't call Patrick Williams a great young player either

"If you're looking to bink a deep end, you gotta pick up a team that you expect to improve dramatically over last year and take the guy most likely to show defensive star power. These awards tend to go to winning teams, and a sudden jolt of winning will help fuel the hype. If you're predicting the new look Bulls to be a playoff contender and get media coverage, then you need to look at **Patrick Williams +10000**. Not because he'll suddenly be the actual best defensive player, but because he's the most likely candidate to see a jump in defense alongside a jump in winning alongside a jump in minutes. I personally think he'll progress and show out in a bunch of advanced defensive metrics next year, but I'd be worried that he won't have the blocks/steals numbers that unfortunately weigh down the perception. Even if Blocks/Steals are highly variable and some portion of them are even reliant on making poor defensive choices and getting lucky.  EDIT: I want to say I'm not personally making this bet, not because I don't believe in Patrick Williams (I do), but because I don't believe in the Bulls."
"Millsap isn’t an All Star any more, but he’s still a quality rotation player and could be a great mentor to young players like the Bulls’ Patrick Williams."
Because we traded 2 power forwards. Millsap can still play and mentor Patrick Williams.

"Probably Bobby Jones. Born in Charlotte NC , went to Carolina and won a ring with Dr. J on the 76ers. 8 All Defensive teams and was a 4 time All Star.

Patrick Williams (though he may be a year or two away from All Star–dom)
"I agree that EM's best position on defense is power forward right now, but really disagree with playing him there on offense. The only ""modern"" aspect of the Cavs offense last year was that we had a bunch of decent shooters at the 4, which opened up the floor so the guards could get into the paint. It is nearly impossible to have even an ok offense playing two bigs who don't have great ball skills and can't shoot.   I think Mobley will be best as a facilitator from the elbow or out of a horns set, where he can pass to guys coming off screens or cutting to the rim.   And if we are being completely honest about it, I he is probably going to get bullied by NBA forwards, too, as a rookie. Just in our division he will be playing against Giannis, Sabonis, Grant, and Patrick Williams."
Patrick Williams will be a real dark horse face of the league player in 10 years.

"Did you watch the Bulls and Markkanen this season?  If Markkanen was in his 2018 mode, that would be worth it. But 2021 Markkanen was a guy who got outperformed by, leave starter PF(Patrick Williams, a rookie) alone, but by his bench teammates as well. No one went for a salary over 10-12M/year for Lauri on trade proposals because of that and the Bulls was going to give him no higher than 9M because of it."

I’m so tickled that The Paw caught on for Patrick Williams so quickly.
"I don't think you can compare a team that has Lavine, Vooch, DeRozan, Ball, Markkanen and Patrick Williams to those other less talented rosters though, like their baseline seems way higher than other teams, or way more likely to be a top team and way less likely to be a lower team when you compare to the other East non-playoff level teams we listed.   Pacers will be solid like they always are, but their roster is worse than the Bulls, so not sure how you think the team with the worse roster between the two will end up being better...when we have no evidence of how poorly or well they will play on the court.  Idk, to me its a pretty clear tier drop after Nets, Bucks, Sixers, Hawks, Heat, Celtics, Knicks and Bulls...there is a very neat top 8 teams, and then a pretty noticeable drop off in talent, so while anything can happen, thats what I would bet on now."
Just a few that I like  Dame Time; Joker; The Klaw; The Paw (Patrick Williams); Time Lord; Off-Night (Davion Mitchell); Khash Money; Slim Reaper/Durantula; Uncle Drew; Web Embiid
"You'll conveniently forget you mocked Murphy when he wins Rookie of the Year.  Murphy should have gone first in the draft. He was clearly the best player in Summer League, with head-to-head matchups against Mobley, Kuminga, and last year's #4, Patrick Williams.  Murphy clowned them all. He was obviously better than those higher picks."
isnt patrick williams 20 today?
Lonzo isn’t the best defender Patrick Williams is
"Lavine , Patrick Williams , demar, vuc , Carusa (duh!)"
"Playoff bound, but I have a hard time seeing them taking a top 6 seed unless Patrick Williams takes a *big* jump. The offense should be pretty damn good, but I have a hard time seeing a core of DeMar, LaVine, and Vucevic scratching a top 20 defensive rating unless Paw proves those Kawhi comparisons right"
They will be really good if patrick williams improves
"It was thaddeus young, now its probably patrick williams"
"I think you are forgetting how good DeMar DeRozan has been. He could have been an all-star last year and the Spurs only let him go because they are rebuilding and had no reason to pay him. The Pelicans are getting ridiculed for letting Zo go, because he certainly shouldn't have been dispensable.  They have 3 players that could all be All-stars this year and Zo and Patrick Williams could be good role players. And their lineup fits decently well together on paper. Some people saying they are contenders are going too far but this team is certainly capable of being a top 4 seed if they mesh well."
"Patrick Williams’ development will be critical. The Bulls have the firepower to match any team in the league, they’ve got two top 10 wing scorers and one of the best post players in the league plus Lonzo who is at least respectable from 3 and can run the break. If PDub can be an OG type 3nD guy, that’s a scaaaary starting 5"
"Thank you for this point!!  This bad D criticism doesn’t hold water when you look at how we’ve performed.  Zach isn’t a great defender but he’s not hopeless like he was when he was 19.  He does some things well.  We saw in the olympics that when he doesn’t have to do it all himself he can be very disruptive in passing lanes and makes plays on that side of the ball. I expect to see improvements from Patrick Williams as well.  He has potential to be a great defender.  Good instincts, smart kid, and good length.  Adding Lonzo and Caruso is a boon to the bulls guard depth and defense.  Tony Bradley’s not a bad back up big either.  I expect this team to be middle of the pack defensively and elite on offense."
Patrick Williams is part of the old regime feel free to give him to us
Yeah this is exactly me with Patrick Williams. He shouldn’t be in the G league but he definitely shouldn’t be a NBA starter right now. We didn’t get any back up options in case he wasn’t ready so now there’s a lot of pressure on him to be a productive NBA starter already when he just turned 20. He also isn’t going to get a whole of touches to develop his offense which I think has higher upside than his defense. You can see on court he’s hard on himself when he feels he’s not playing well.
Vooch= peak Shaq.  Demar= peak Jordan  Zach= peak Jordan  Pat Will= peak Patrick Williams  Do you get it now?
Isaac is pretty good. I think Scottie will be better but as of today Isaac has him beat. I can't say the same for Patrick Williams.
How's Patrick Williams been looking?
"Some people just gotta see to believe. The Bulls have 3 returning players from last year, not including the trade deadline acquisitions. Zach, Coby White, and Patrick Williams. It’s hard to put any faith into a team that hasn’t proven anything yet during the off-season."
Patrick Williams taking only steps backwards...  ...Bulls undefeated.  I am conflicted.  But happy.
Patrick Williams doing his best Avery Bradley/Tony Snell impression again...
"They tried to get a veteran 4 in free agency but it didn’t work out. It’s definitely a weakness in the starting lineup. No offense to Patrick Williams, he’s just too young to be a legit starter on a playoff team."
"The Bulls are looking great. They share the ball, they play hard on both sides of the court, especially in the defensive end. Even if they have a bad shooting night, they have monster defenders like Ball, Caruso, Green, Patrick Williams who have the ability to disrupt any offensive possession with their agility and defensive IQ. Ball and Caruso have been absolutely mind blowing and I'm happy for them, coz their true potential is in full display. Lavine and Derozan are getting easy buckets, and everyone passes the ball, keeps the offense flowing. Even if the shots don't fall down, it's good to see a team like Chicago playing unselfish basketball. Looking forward to their matches against powerhouses like the Nets, Bucks, Jazz, Warriors, and so on."
You seriously don't think Kawhi changed the game? He's the perfect prototype of guys like Patrick Williams and who they look up to
"Exactly, i didn’t get it at all. At least have him struggle. Lavine is capable of taking games over all by himself, and that’s exactly what he did because Casey let him. So so strange. Grant, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, even Killian would’ve done better.   Instead Casey had our best perimeter defender in Grant guard Patrick Williams all game, as if he’s any sort of offensive threat. Smh."
"If the Bulls are gonna play good D, they have serious potential. All hinges on the coach finding the right lineups. Probably this falls on how good Patrick Williams can be on defense and him plus Lonzo and Vucevic will be rebounding.   Lavine, Vucevic and Derozan should be able to score. If Lavine can actually turn the D up like Booker can and did last playoffs watch out."
How was Patrick Williams today?
"Patrick Williams, Caruso and ball are good defenders."
I thought Patrick Williams was injured?
Patrick Williams is just wearing his jersey in warmups lol
"Nikola Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Demar Derozan, Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball  Vs.   Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, Rip Hamilton, Luol Deng, Derrick Rose.   I think it’d be a close game but I’d give the edge to the 11/12 Bulls. They were the first overall seed for a reason."
patrick williams is back wym
"THT is pretty much 21. I mean, there shouldn't be many ""clear cut rising stars"" otherwise it wouldn't mean much. THT does get a lot of hype and I think that's what he was addressing. I mean, people don't talk about a guy like Patrick Williams like they do THT; he's a year younger but more productive and has a higher ceiling.   Imo ""clear cut rising stars"" (or already stars for some) at 20 recently would be like Simmons, Ingram, Luka, Trae, Zion, Ja, Edwards, Ball, maybe Ayton, Murray, JJJ, Sexton, Tatum, Herro, KPJ.  I'm not shitting on THT and I don't think the other guy was either. I'm just saying that it's not really a terrible take to say he's not a rising star. It may not be that meaningful of a take, since I don't think anyone is actually expecting him to be anything more than a good starter, but it's not inaccurate. I'm sure he'll take another big step this season."
"Chicago is about as proven as Charlotte. They finished the season 2 games behind them and have made significant improvements since then. They’re substantially better on paper than they were last year and than Charlotte is right now. I mean defensively they’re on the same tier. Both have predominantly negative or neutral defenders but competent defensive coaches.  Chicago has more standout defenders like Caruso, Lonzo and Williams. Offensively it’s not close. Chicago arguably has the 3 best players among both teams, if not 3 of the 4 best.  Not to mention Lonzo, an improving Patrick Williams and solid role players like white or Caruso   The Celtics aside from last year have been deep playoff teams and top seeds basically every season. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that their outlier season was a season they were plagued by both injuries and Covid. Rob and TT, their primary big men, missed a combined 38 games. Kemba missed 29. Smart missed 27. Brown missed 14. Tatum only missed 8, but when he was on the court he was dealing with a lot of the physical symptoms from covid and was noticeably struggling with things like conditioning. And they’ve improved over the off season a fair bit. Horford is still in the better half of starting Centers and due to his play style is always impactful. Schroder at worst is a quality sixth man spark plug. Richardson was great in Miami, was stuck in a complete shitshow of a situation with a bad fit in Philly, and then delt with Covid for most of the year in Dallas. He’s still an athletic defensive wing that can hit an open 3. As a team, Tatum brown Horford and co should help them be at worst, an average offensive team. Defensively they would be top 5."
Patrick Williams is going to have such an easier time with respect to what he's asked to do defensively that I bet he takes a step forward offensively.
Jordan Poole Patrick Williams RJ Barrett Cam Reddish Jaren Jackson
"This is what I meant, that preseason step back on patrick williams is all the proof I need that Jaren can get his own buckets"
I think he's really going to benefit from Derozan being on the team and you'll see Patrick Williams with a few midrange moves by the end of the year.
"As a Bulls fan, I’d be cool with Wiggins for 25m, he’s pretty much a developed version of Patrick Williams, starting lineup of Lonzo/Lavine/Derozan/Wiggins/Vucevic would be insanely good."
"I agree this isn't a hot take, because it's realistic. I do think bulls at least make it to the play in tourney at seeds 7-10, but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't make the actual playoffs. Like you said they really only have one true all star I'm Lavine. Vooch is good, but he's really not THAT good and DeMar is way past his prime. I think ball will be the perfect fit but things will get awkward with a rotation of ball, Coby white, and Caruso. I do think Patrick Williams could break out, but there's so many average to barely above average guys on this team that the minutes are gonna look really weird. If the bulls focus on developing the younger guys I could see this team being competitive in a few years, but as of right now they don't have the star power to get out of the east imo."
"True but I would say Patrick Williams is the better answer to this question. If he can knock down open threes, play d, rebound, and do it consistently the Bulls starting 5 will be as good as any in the league."
Think you spelled Patrick Williams wrong there
That crossover-stepback three over patrick williams was nasty
Alex Caruso and Patrick Williams
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"1. he doesn't fit with the bulls. lonzo need the ball in his hands, just like simmons though he cannot create for himself in a half court setting. but he doesn't need to because lavine will take 20 shots, derozan and vuc both are scorers. adding kyrie makes no sense. and who is to say derozan isn't the 4 this year anyway, did u forget about patrick williams at the 3?  2. this isn't 2K dude. murray for kyrie is a terrible trade. just because you think talent and fit wise it would work, you need to take into considerstion context and situation. no way the nuggets risk trading jamal murray, homegrown guy who has great chemistry with the team, for a headcase like kyrie  3. Kyrie would not want to play with LeBron ""father figure"" James ever again. And they just traded for Westbrook. As if they trade for Kyrie  4. Sixers want to trade Ben Simmons. The organisation (Morey) is not trading him for Kyrie. Needs to maximise Embiid's window, trading for Ky who can't even play in philly is not doing that pal  5. You can't even spell Joe Ingles' name. But this is the funniest one by far. No team says yes to this one🤣 not even the Nets."
"Zach, Coby, and Patrick Williams are the only returning players from the start of the season last year. We improved in nearly every way possible."
"With Kawhi it was somewhat leading up to the draft where it figured he would be picked around the slots where the Pacers were drafting. They had picked Granger earlier and that always has had me watch closely for what players are rumoured to go to them. A year later Paul George went around that range and was one of the small forward I could see getting drafted there. Last year I expected Patrick Williams to go around the end of the lottery, and he kind of fits the archetype, if you will. Liked him a lot as well, but didnt expect him at 4 - he needs to start showing more poise though. Tends to float throughout the games a bit.   With Sabonis it was just really that his dad was a legend and that Sabonis did incredibly well in college. Even though he has t-rex arms, he never showed that it would slow him down.  &amp;#x200B;  CDR - had such high hopes for him. So much fun at Memphis. Wrong NBA era though. We shoudlvé known though, with them drafting Antoine Wright, Boone, Marcus Williams and Sean Williams in the top 25 in previous years...."
"&gt;Saying Ball got here because ""his daddy sending him around the world to gain experience for the league"" is disingenuous because Wiseman could have done the same thing.  Dude, I don't know if you know, but Wiseman's family was in poverty before he got a NBA contract. Lavar lives in a mansion in Chino Hills. LaMelo was driving Lamborghinis before he graduated high school. Not only that, Lavar was raking in millions from his business, special appearances, and Facebook exclusive show. When you are struggling to make ends meet, you can't just get up and move to an entirely new country at will.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;talk about moving the goalposts. He was expected to be the starting center for a team that has championship aspirations.     Two things can be at the same time. I don't know how many Warriors games you watched, but they were piss poor at center when facing bigger teams. Their front-court was always their biggest issue. When facing players like Embiid, Atyon, Gobert, Valančiūnas, and Jokic, the Warriors simply had no answer for them. That required Curry and Co. to work much harder to score because Draymond and whatever center they had couldn't make a shot past 6 feet. All long as Curry, Thompson, and Green share the floor together, the Warriors will always have championship aspirations. Wiseman needed time to get acclimated to the physicality of the NBA. Like I said before, dude was a high schooler playing against grown men who are more aggressive and physical than him.   Look, we can go back and forth on this, but I am not changing my mind. I support my favorite team and their players through thick and thin. I am more invested in being entertained than stressing out about who is better than who. Hell, Patrick Williams and Tyrese Maxey shocked everyone with how good they were, but I don't see Warriors fans dwelling on passing them up. Wiseman is a good kid and I want him to be successful. I didn't grow up much different than him, so I am rooting for him. If we still have a Reddit account a few years from now, we can get back in touch to see if the Wiseman experience pans out. Hopefully, you won't jump ship in the meantime."
"Maybe he'll be something someday but 2nd year Patrick Williams is not a ""great"" defender. And to say Coby White or Troy Brown are even average defenders, let alone ""great"" is hilariously delusional. There's no one on the Bulls who can anchor a defense like Capela does."
I think the defence is not going to be as bad as people say it is. Last year's Bulls were ranked #12 on defence with Patrick Williams as the best defender (followed by probably Thad Young). Not saying it's going to be fantastic but the talks about defence might be overblown
"agreed. the guard and sf position is very deep with shooting and passing. Only thing lacking would be a solid backup bigman and a ""Lebron stopper"" type player (no one really stops Lebron but at least athletic enough to make him work for it). Hoping Patrick Williams can evolve into this but it is quite an ask."
"Still missing 3 of our rotation players Patrick Williams, Coby White, and Tony Bradley."
Patrick williams will be very good this year
"Bro I don't know the life of every rookie coming into the league. But loads of players have come from poverty: Lebron, Carmelo, KD, Butler, and Rose from just the top of my head. Hell I remember from Patrick Williams draft bio he helped his mother deliver flowers. Now tell me how someone who runs a flower shop is going to be able to spend thousands of kids equipment, and having to drive them around the country for games for hockey.   Like theres a reason why 97% of the NHL is white. It's not because they're superior to other races, but because of the opportunities they got. White people dominate in swimming, does that mean black people are not built like them for water. Or is it because they generally have better access to pools to train in."
Yeah I feel like the majority of NBA fans don’t get how the Noles system operates. I remember when Patrick Williams got drafted Bulls fans were besides themselves because he wAsN’t eVeN a StarTeR aT FSU!!
Yeah I think both Vassell and Kabengele were 3 stars. Patrick Williams also wasn't highly recruited out of high school I think.
"What other colleges can stack up with FSU right now in the NBA? I know there are a few, but for being a football school it’s shocking that FSU has to be in the top-5ish?  PG - Scottie Barnes SG - Malik Beasley SF - Terrence Mann PF - Patrick Williams C - Jonathan Isaac  Devin Vassell off the bench"
"I'd love to hear your reasoning for why.   LaVine showed at the Olympics that he can be a really good defender when he's locked in, and we already know how good Patrick Williams can be. Lonzo, Caruso and Green are solid defensively too.   Vuc and DeMar are a problem for sure, but I think the have enough around them to not be ""SHIT""."
"I was hesitant on chicago and the team they've put together. I didn't quite see it in my head. Way too soon to say this after only 1 pre-season game. But boy oh boy did they blow my mind. I think that team will be very good. Give them a year to gel properly and they can genuinely be a problem, especially if patrick williams fills out his potential and they add a couple of bench upgrades"
When did Patrick Williams shoot 8 threes a game?
"Think about it from the Suns' perspective, Ayton is their best young non-Booker talent and the Bulls can't offer anything in the draft other than a non-lottery Portland 1st and 2nds.   Vucevic is a nice starting point, but Coby white wouldn't even have a large role on their team. I don't think they would make the trade without Patrick Williams involved and at that point the Bulls are out because there's no way they're trading Patrick Williams."
"PF is Patrick Williams (currently injured), sixth man would be Caruso, but I think he meant Coby White(injured)"
most athletic team in the league for Shure. Patrick Williams know how to dunk as well
They definitely are but it’s nice to get a little taste of what the Bulls will look like offensively. This is also without Patrick Williams and Coby White.
"Yeah thats true but Derozan will defend the perimeter and we will slide Patrick Williams to the 4, who is a good defender and might take a leap this year as well. Im hopeful right now, could definitely change when the season starts though."
"Not crazy, but something that bothers me:  Patrick Williams is a wing picked 4th overall in 2020 after his freshman year at Florida State.  Scottie Barnes is a wing picked 4th overall in 2021 after his freshman year at Florida State.  Scottie Barnes is 25 days older than PWill."
"Yeah we had Theis for 20 games, and Vuc will be paired with Patrick Williams instead who is also a good defender. Hopefully that will work out so we can still be an average team defensively."
"We still ranked 8th defensively after the deadline with Theis/Vuc starting, with a defensive rating of 112.9, and he will be paired with Patrick Williams inside this season. He is a bad defender but it still looks like we could be average defensively next year if last season was a good indicator. Donovan is a good defensive coach, which is the most important when defending as a unit."
"Yeah now we have Lonzo and Caruso, who are two great defenders, and Patrick Williams will probably make a jump this season"
"LaVine and Vuc aren't great defenders, but neither of them are bad at defense. DeMar is obviously not a good defender but let's not fail to mention that we have Lonzo Ball and Patrick Williams in the starting lineup and off the bench we have Caruso, Tony Bradley, Troy Brown Jr., DJJ, Stanley Johnson, etc. the entire bench was pretty much molded with athleticism and defense being the two highest priorities.   12th in the league defensively last year, 8th in the league after trading for Vuc, and despite losing thad i don't think that's enough for us to even be in the bottom half defensively this year and looking at our roster we clearly have guys who are capable of playing good defense."
"Yeah for a few games but we were playing him next to Wendell Carter most of the year, and then we started Theis/Vuc for 20 games after deadline. This year will be Patrick Williams and Vuc inside."
"I really like Patrick Williams, but they better not rush a sophomore from a nagging ankle injury to be the defensive anchor of a team full of vets"
I’m interested to see how the Bulls start the year. I would imagine not having Patrick Williams for the start of the year will hurt a team that lacks defensive pieces. But they probably have the offense to make up for it.
"The bench is loaded with defenders like Caruso, Djj, and tony Bradley not to mention Patrick Williams being the reincarnation of Kawhi. Billy Donovan just has to make proper rotations to balance the offensive and defensive players. Not to mention we were 12th in defensive rating last year with even worse defenders so Billy does a really good job at making defensive schemes anyways. I think the main defensive hole in the starting 5 is DeRozan but I think he’s going to start games but play most of his minutes with the bench squad to provide more offense anyways"
"Patrick Williams, Jalen Smith, Desmond Bane, &amp;... Poku"
Patrick Williams
"Patrick Williams, Onyeka Okongwu, Josh Green, Tyrese Maxey. When in doubt, bet on youth."
"The Bulls were 11th last year starting Coby, Markkanen, and a 19 yr old patrick williams  I dont see us getting worse"
completely agree about Patrick Williams. I think he's gonna be a ghost on the court sometimes this year. should be good defensively but won't do much on offense while surrounded by all those scorers.   he's the type of player who probably won't be a star until he is forced to take shots and initiate offense
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise.

There's The Paw (Patrick Williams)
"I say this as a Bulls fan:  The Bulls are completely and utterly unproven which is the biggest reason nobody is talking about them. They have a bunch of high caliber players who have not had playoff success. Both Vooch and Zach are stars on non-playoff teams and its been awhile since Derozan has done much in the playoffs.   The reality is that we haven't seen a roster construction like this before and it is really hard to know what to expect. IMO they will surprise a lot of people and be in the 4-5 seed region.   I agree with you that on paper this team seems really really good for flying this low under the radar. The starting 5 is extremely solid from 1-5 with a great mix of veteran and young players. They have to have one of the most athletic rosters in the whole league, and the bench has some really nice pieces in Coby White and Caruso.   The only way I see this team playing poorly is if Vucevic gets hurt. The center depth is not good and having to depend on Tony Bradley is a recipe for disaster. The guard and wing depth is really good though. I also think that we will se Patrick Williams playing a decent amount of small ball center. He is really strong and has great rim protection instincts."
"Patrick Williams will likely be their defensive anchor, although that’s a pretty big ask for a sophomore. His position lends itself to that role though more than zo"
THT over Patrick Williams? Good googly moogly what a take
1. Patrick Williams  2-10. Don't Matter
"I count 1. Patrick Williams. Ball will regress if you use him as a PG, DeRozan SHOULD be the PG but he is also a massive liability on D. Vucevic is also a massive liability on D, the bench outside of Caruso isn't that good, the defense ls looking like a complete dumpster fire in general"
I feel like you being a suns fan you should understand the difference a good floor general brings. Bulls should’ve been in the playoffs last year but a Vuc injury and Lavine entering covid protocols right as they made a run really hindered them. Their record wasn’t really representative of the team.   Also a lot actually hinges on Patrick Williams an his development. If he takes a big jump suddenly this team has 5 starters that can kill you offensively.   Caruso was the 2nd best POA defender in the NBA and Lonzo was I think 15-17. PWill is an elite defender in the making. Lavine was used as a defensive specialist in the olympics and should benefit from having Lonzo and Williams on the floor with him. Vuc is actually a fairly good team defender. He’s just not a crazy rim protector. But he moves well and has a big body.   This team is easily the most slept on team so far. Media absolutely hates the Bulls. 4 seed you heard it here first.
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
"You see someone like Duren, Ayton, Patrick Williams etc. who just look like men amongst boys on the court as prospects and you say ""Oh that makes sense, I totally get why he's a projected top 5 pick.""  And then we have skeletors like Chet Holmgren competing for #1 overall and it really makes you question how much physical maturity/strength really matters."
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
Why would you compare last years hawks to last years bulls when the only player who was in the Bulls starting line up last year was Lavine and a rookie Patrick Williams…?
I made some very out there takes about Patrick Williams that may not come true.
"Took me a quick 10 second google search to find a [Kawhi Leonard comp](https://nbadraftroom.com/p/patrick-williams/). I don't know why it's so unbelievable when scouts and ""analysts"" always throw hyperbolic comparisons at the wall and see which one sticks."
"I can't speak to all of them, but I definitely remember these being comps in general for Lonzo, Lavine, and DeMar for sure.  Patrick Williams being Kawhi also makes sense because every prospect is now labeled Kawhi."
"Patrick Williams is our big guy defender. He was pretty good last year as an 18 year old rookie and can theoretically only get better. He’s out for the regular season but if he’s fit and ready he’ll be back for the playoffs.  But yeah I agree bucks, nets, and Philly to me are too much. We need Patrick Williams to explode and be healthy and at least one more 3&amp;D bench player to really compete.  Although expecting a 4th overall pick off a decent rookie season to be good and one solid bench player away from serious contention is a pretty good spot to be at to be fair."
Would the Bulls being willing to trade Patrick Williams? If we're trading Wood I'd ideally like to get a promising young player in return instead of just salary filler and future picks. We already did that once with the Harden trade.
"Also a slew of quality role players.  Deni, Patrick Williams, Maxey, Saddiq Bey, Bane, Beef Stew, Jaden McDaniels, Okoro, Cole Anthony etc.... it was an above draft at the end of the day."
"Do you think the Bulls would be willing to offer up Patrick Williams in a trade? I’ve always liked him as a prospect, but not sure if he’d be considered an untouchable guy for y’all."
Trade Patrick Williams and you instantly have a real Contender. But can they swallow his 20 million?
"Out of context, what you've written seems reasonable. Here's the context, courtesy of Bill Simmons:  &gt;*(Step) 44. Lather, rinse, repeat: After the 2006 Warriors won 34 games for the second straight year. Mully went old-school, fired Montgomery and hired … good God, that’s Don Nelson’s music! Warriors fans were so excited, they didn’t even care that the Warriors just blew another lottery pick (Patrick O’Bryant, ninth overall). In January of 2007, Mully jumped on Indiana’s need to clean house post-melee by swapping three former top-14 picks (Diogu, Dunleavy and Murphy) for Al Harrington and Stephen Jackson.*  &gt;*Do you believe? You better believe. Because …*  &gt;*The Warriors finished over .500! (42-40, but still.)*  &gt;*And made the playoffs! (As an 8-seed, but still.)*  &gt;*And shocked the no. 1 seed Mavericks in Round 1! (Wait, what????)*  &gt;*And nearly toppled the Jazz in Round 2! (Sooooooo close … I’m still shaking my head.)*  &gt;*Other things that happened that spring: A rarely seen triple rejuvenation (Baron Davis, Don Nelson, Stephen Jackson); everyone realizing/remembering that the Warriors’ home crowd trumps just about everyone when it actually has something to root for; the Warriors becoming YouTube’s first official NBA team; the “We Believe” tidal wave; and, of course, Golden State’s first playoff appearance in 13 years, first trip to the second round in 16 years and sixth taste of the postseason since 1977.*    &gt;**(Step) 45: In true Warriors fashion, the team celebrated the previous paragraph for exactly one month before blowing things up.**    &gt;*(Step) 46:They traded Richardson to Charlotte for the eighth pick of the 2007 draft, then took Brandan Wright one spot ahead of Joakim Noah. With their own pick (no. 18), they drafted Marco Belinelli to replace Richardson. So … yeah.*   &gt;*(Step) 47:  The ’08 Warriors won 48 games — their highest win total since 1994 — but somehow made history by winning the most games by any team that didn’t make the playoffs. Only the Warriors. That summer, they lost Baron Davis (signed by the Clippers for $60 million), missed out on Elton Brand (went to Philly), then panic-signed Corey Maggette to a five-year, $50 million deal. That summer was the equivalent of the gang fight in Anchorman — things got out of hand pretty fast, and I think Brick killed a guy.*  &gt;*(Step) 48:  I forgot: That same summer, they traded a future no. 1 pick to New Jersey for the rights to troubled rookie Marcus Williams … who ended up playing nine games for them. On the bright side, this made Russell Cross and Chris Washburn feel better. Four years later, Utah owns the rights to that “future” draft choice; unless it lands in the top seven, Golden State will lose that pick. We No Longer Believe.*  &gt;*(Step) 49:  That same summer, Mully spent $129 million on six-year extensions for Biedrins (gulp) and Ellis … who celebrated a few weeks later by crashing his motor scooter, tearing ankle ligaments, then trying to cover up the accident before getting caught. The Warriors suspended him without pay for 30 games, which he couldn’t have played anyway because, again, he ripped up his ankle riding a motor scooter.*  &gt;**(Step) 50:  Needless to say, the 2009 Warriors won 29 games and declined to renew Mully’s extension.**   So, what were you saying again?  lol"
Even scarier is that they’re still missing Patrick Williams
"they destroyed the bulls 109-77 the other day although the bulls were missing patrick williams, vucevic, and caruso.  i don't really know anything else, though."
One Patrick Williams please
"I want the Knicks to completely self destruct because Mitchell Robinson injured Patrick Williams and now he’s out for the season, robbing us of the opportunity to be even better than what we are now"
You can have him! One [patrick williams please ](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/557/217/803.jpg)
"Let's say they had a... Idk. Mid to mid high level PF. Idk.... Like a Marcus Morris or a Patrick Williams, Daniel Theis.  Where someone like Marcus Morris may give you better scoring / shooting at the expense of playmaking.   You think they'd be easier to counter and potentially not win the chip? That's a very interesting point and I'd like to hear more. Maybe games in the year where steph and klay played but not dray or the net rating with and without dray"
Lavine   Lonzo  Derozen  Vuc  Patrick Williams  Alex Caruso  Coby White  Ayo Dosunmu
"Incorrect. We've been playing better since Patrick Williams went down, and that's really not his fault. Hopefully, he can recover and become as tenacious a defender as Caruso and Green."
"Coby White, Nikola Vucevic and Patrick Williams missed significant time in this stretch too."
Patrick Williams sends his regards
The Knicks best play this year?   Knocking out Patrick Williams for the entire year with a bench player.  Fuck 'em.
"""Not without Patrick Williams"" was the clown take lol.    Yes the Bulls are so bad and have no chance to be a contender now that a guy who was doing pretty much nothing very well is out.   literally noone with half a brain or whos watched more than 1 Bulls game is saying ""dang the bulls really miss him""   DJJ is playing infinitely better right now than he ever has.   And even Green is contributing more to winning basketball than him."
And the loss of Patrick Williams is the difference for them in my opinion.
Not without Patrick Williams.
Patrick Williams
From a neutral perspective:  &amp;#x200B;  SUPER SURPRISE:  Kelan Martin  - SF on the Pacers  Omer Yutseven - PF on Heat  Jalen McDaniels -PF on Hornets  Franz Wagner - SF on Magic  Malachi Flynn - PG on Raptors  Isiah Jackson - C on Pacers  &amp;#x200B;  NOT SURPRISING:  Scottie Barnes:  Patrick Williams  Mobley  Lu Dort  Tyrese Haliburton  Immanuel Quickley:  Tyrese Maxey
Patrick Williams
More on the way!   Look out for Cam'Ron Fletcher from this year's team. He reminds me of Patrick Williams.
Patrick Williams is like Anunoby with more midrange. I like Mikal Bridges for the same reason but he’s smaller than both
I think these guys have all star potential:  Darius Garland  Patrick Williams  Wendell Carter Jr  Killian Hayes
"Stanley Johnson   In all seriousness I’d go with Patrick Williams, sucks he’s out for the year"
"Man that is just deeply saddening news. Just like with Patrick Williams... Cavaliers strong start was awesome and I am sure they still would kept chugging along at a 6/7/8 seed pace with the way they were playing.  Okoro, Garland and Osman time to step up and replenish what is likely 25 points a game."
"It was looking like Caruso was taking minutes from Patrick Williams. So if you would’ve brought in Pat to cover AG, Monte wouldn’t have had Caruso defending him and we would’ve scored through him."
"Caruso is basically the starter over Patrick Williams. He was getting more minutes from the bench anyways.   Also, it’d be more equivalent if the Bulls were missing Lavine, DeMar, and Vuc.   Nugs were on the end of a back to back as well"
Anthony edwards has a competent coach and is not engulfed with the losers for his whole career.  Patrick williams starts being aggresive
I’d like PJ Washington from the Hornets and Patrick Williams from the Bulls  Don’t know if the those teams would do that tho.  But he’d make them a lot better
Vuc is out with covid and Patrick Williams is our for the season
"fuck that's two players seasons we've ended so far   first patrick williams on the bulls and now collin sexton  we're a menace, and not in a good way.  I dont even remember what play it happened on, did we do something dirty or is it just unfortunate luck"
You guys didn’t have Patrick Williams either right?
"Tbf Chicago’s defence has been substantially better than it should be on paper lmao. You have guys like vuc and Demar, historical defensive liabilities, actually buying in and playing solid d. The fact that it’s happening without Patrick Williams is the most impressive part"
Patrick Williams
Patrick...patrick williams =(   But defense is a team sport and they guarded ad last night by harassing the hell out of him and they can do the same to giannis
"Patrick Williams got hurt so we are rotating the 4, Javonte Green was starting there and now Caruso is."
"Patrick Williams going down, vooch getting COVID, and Coby White just coming backreally doesn't help the depth.  Vooch will be back soon and Coby will start to get reaclamated should help. He'll be dangerous AF off the bench. Then they could definitely get a backup vet 4."
"&gt;Chicago is without Patrick Williams and Coby White, which is a far more impactful loss than Morris, Winslow, Johnson and Preston, so yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that both squads were pretty shorthanded.  Sir you are delusional if you think patrick williams and coby white are more impactful loss than morris and ibaka"
"&gt; Are we comparing kawhi to vooch now?  I'm not saying Vooch is *as good as* Kawhi, but he's a two time all-star, a career 17/10/3 guy and a legit player. He costs $24m for a reason and missing him is a big deal.  &gt; Vooch has been struggling all year lol  Vooch had a stretch of 10 bad games. I'm not going to blow smoke and claim he wasn't struggling, but it's 10 games to start the season, relax. He's an 11 year vet, he'll come good, he didn't suddenly go from all-star to washed up over the 4 month offseason break.  What's more, I wasn't just referring to Vooch. Chicago is without Patrick Williams and Coby White, which is a far more impactful loss than Morris, Winslow, Johnson and Preston, so yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that both squads were pretty shorthanded."
"Lebron's an unrestricted free agent next year, so he has the option to leave but also Caruso probably would save some of the older Lakers' players in terms of health in the long run. Lakers had the best defense in the regular reason last year and in terms of total defensive contributions throughout the season, Caruso was arguably their best guy. He was top in total 538 Defensive Overall Raptor and just behind Marc Gasol as #2 in DBPM. Plus just the eye test, you could see the effort he would put in throughout the season.   Caruso is now putting in Power Forward minutes for the Bulls after Patrick Williams' injury and succeeding there. Sounds pretty useful to help out with Lebron / AD load management."
"I’m really bummed Patrick Williams went down, but this unit is sick in his absence"
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
"""He's Kevin Durant. You know who he is. We tried I promise we did"" - Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley.  I believe the lesson learned is they know who KD is now.    That or the power of friendship?"
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23.

Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
Patrick Williams is going to be good too. Shame he had that injury right at the start of the season.
"I actually like a lot of your depth pieces. Alize, Green, and Ayo have good potential to be high level role players. Patrick Williams being out didn't help. Tony Bradley struggled today but I still think he's a good backup C, just not a starter when Vuc is out."
"The absence of Patrick Williams is going to hurt. He's their only real quality defensive big, and even then he was really a 4 in a small forward's body."
"I think the importance of Patrick Williams is a bit overstated, at least in the short term. His development is hugely important for the future of this core, but right now he's still raw and I think people are rating him much more on potential than his actual role on the team. He's not the difference between being a contender or not at this point in his career. Of course it's possible he could have grown into that role if he had a full healthy regular season, but the guy is still only 20 years old and I wouldn't expect him to develop into such a crucial player so soon."
They’re a rung below the top contenders imo. If Patrick Williams had been healthy the whole year I could have seen it because I really expected him to grow into an x-factor for them. Not sure how he will be having missed so much time.
"In all seriousness, at this point I think the Sixers would have to throw in picks to trade Simmons for Lonzo. Would you trade Simmons and a 2023 unprotected first rounder and second rounder in 2024 for Lonzo and Patrick Williams (not sure if more salary would be needed)?"
"Here is the trade in question:  &gt;**Boston Celtics** receive: Karl-Anthony Towns  &gt;**Philadelphia 76ers** receive: Jaylen Brown and Patrick Beverley  &gt;**Minnesota Timberwolves** receive: Ben Simmons, Robert Williams III, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden Springer and 2022 first-round pick (from PHI)"
"The PAW, P-Dub, Patrick Williams"
is PAtrick Williams out for the seaosn?
"You can try to stop one thing with KD, but his bag is so deep you'll end up giving him something else.   I don't have the effort to link it right now, but Google the Patrick Beverly and Lou Williams interview about KD. When NBA players are looking at reporters and going, you got any ideas? That's KD"
Patrick Williams has had less highlights reach the front page in his entire career than Scottie does after a single 8point performance
lmao we had to sit through y’all comparing Patrick Williams to Kawhi let our fanbase be crazy too
"&gt; Patrick Williams  trust me dude, we all wish he took more shots too, the coaching staff and all the players on the team have constantly urged him to be more aggressive but he’s just so passive"
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
"I mean outside of LaMelo (who is clearly the best) and Edwards (who is clearly the 2nd best), he could reasonably end up in 3rd.   Currently, he's competing for that 3rd place spot with Cole Anthony, Tyrese Haliburton, and Desmond Bane (Patrick Williams would be up there too but he's hurt)"
"Biggest reason I said people were under estimating this team. Billy is a legit defensive coach, it’s still wild our team finished 13th in defensive rating last year with Garret Temple and a rookie Patrick Williams as our best defenders."
"I love Ayo man. I just also love Patrick Williams and don’t think 10 games is comparable to a 72-game season. This was the best game of Ayo’s career so far, and I’d be ecstatic to be proven wrong about him compared to P Will, but you’re being a prisoner of the moment if you think that this performance outshines an entire season of solid defense and good, if a bit timid, offense.  Williams is one of the rare NBA players that can realistically guard 1-4 and even some 5s."
"He's not even Top 10 yet... but I'll humor your argument, even though your argument contains mostly shitty non-basketball related arguments. ""small college hero"", ""off the court class act"" lmao wtf does that have to do with the GOAT conversation?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Steph’s Accolade’s over 12 years:      3x champion 2nd all time 3-pointers 2x MVP (unanimous) 7x all star 7x all NBA All rookie first team 6-time all NBA 3-point field goal leader      Regular season career stats:      34.3 career mins per game 24.2 ppg 4.6 reb 5.9 ast 47.6 fg%  Some of the GOATS worth discussion (Lebron, MJ) both have 4 or more rings, in which they won Finals MVPs for all of them, have averaged 27 and 30 points in their careers, and are #3 and #5 in all time points respectively. Lebron and MJ both have 17 all star appearances, both were ROY, and both on all-defensive teams. In short, both players have more accolades and success with better career ppg, rpg, apg (not mj), spg, bpg, and fg%. What does steph have again...?  Right now he's ranked #71/#67 all time in points behind Bob McAdoo, is behind Ray Allen in 3 pointers, is tied with Giannis and Steve Nash with 2 mvps, is tied with the likes of Javale Mcgee, Patrick McCaw, and James Jones with 3 rings, has less all star appearances than Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, less all NBA appearances than Moses Malone, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Garnett, and less ROYs than Ben Simmons and Michael Carter Williams. In regards to defensive teams and finals mvps, he has the same as you and I do, 0.  Forget Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, and Duncan, curry is only discussed with and might be below Kareem, Big O, Jerry West, and even KD.  If you want to go off the fact that he is only 33, then I can literally point to Giannis only being 26 and Luka being 22 as better contenders for the GOAT case in the future.  Let's just say that if his game ages gracefully and he plays another 5 years with the best case scenario (another MVP, 2 Finals MVP+rings, 5x all star appearances, 30 ppg average), then he STILL doesn't beat any GOAT candidate. If you add 30 ppg for the rest of his 5 year career, he still only has 31000 points, which makes him 8th all time. If you add 5 more all star appearances he would still only would have 12. If you add another MVP he still only has 3, and if you add 2 more rings and finals mvps he would still only have 2 finals mvps and 5 rings, same as Kobe, who realistically also isn't even in the GOAT conversation.  Just to contextualize, Curry would have to have at least 2 more mvps, at least 2-3 more rings all with finals mvp, at least 5-6 defensive all nba first or second team selections, at least 6 more first team all nba selections, and at least 7 more all star selections to even have similar accolades to **compare** with GOAT tier players.   To have similar **career** stats, steph would have to literally average 43.7 points per game while playing every single game for the next 5 seasons, average 9.8 rebounds, and lord knows how many blocks/steals just to have a similar stat to the lowest of either GOAT player (27 ppg, 6.4 rpg).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: fuck no"
Older than Patrick Williams too. He was expected to be nba ready right away.
"Much more limited role. Patrick Williams is playing 30mpg guarding the opposing team’s best wing and being a neutral-positive on offense. Ayo isn’t a bad defender, but is much less versatile and is much less useful in a lineup alongside multiple stars than is Williams."
He's already out-performing Patrick Williams imo
If Patrick Williams had Ayo's confidence and hustle he would literally be a Kawhi Leonard replica.
[Patrick Williams wanted to come to FSU because they would teach him to play defense.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/11/10/21556874/2020-nba-draft-patrick-williams-florida-state)
"Gonna sound corny but our biggest strength right now is team chemistry. I didn't foresee that all these new guys were gonna adapt to each other and LaVine so quickly.  Our biggest weakness is obviously depth at 4 and forward defense. With Patrick Williams gone, we can only make do with Javonte Green and DJJ for so long. Also we probably need a more experienced backup 5, Tony Bradley is fine and I like his game actually. But someone gotta be able to challenge and/or complement Vucevic."
Patrick Williams wouldn't save us from korkmaz having his yearly fuck the bulls game
Patrick Williams and Coby White but alrighty
"We're not fully healthy though. Zach is playing with injury, patrick williams and coby white are both out"
Because Vuc is in the enes kanter class of defense and Patrick Williams is injured
i cant watch the bulls without feeling guilty that we might have derailed their nice season by breaking patrick williams hand  I know it's not my fault personally but I still feel like I need to apologize
"Before Patrick Williams go injured, I liked Pat Will Ic De Ball Zach"
"the last 3 draft classes before this, the 3rd and 4th picks were;  Lamelo Patrick Williams RJ Barret Deandre Hunter Luka JJJ  yeah bunch of scrubs tbh"
"PWill was going up for a dunk, got fouled really hard, landed on his wrist, damaged his wrist muscles. Will undergo surgery. Foul was ruled a flagrant.  From: https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/what-happens-next-following-patrick-williams-injury  &gt;Those are just some of the possibilities, speculation and angst now that Bulls starting power forward Patrick Williams likely will miss the rest of the regular season with torn ligaments in his left wrist. Williams sustained the injury on a dunk attempt when Mitchell Robinson slid over from the left side to block the driving attempt just as Williams made a pair of baskets. No one suggested it was intentional, though Robinson was assessed a flagrant foul.  &gt;The Bulls Friday released this statement: ""Chicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams will undergo surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left wrist from an injury sustained in last night's game vs. the New York Knicks. Williams is expected to miss approximately 4-6 months."""
What happened to Patrick Williams? Completely missed this
I think Bulls fans are much higher on Patrick Williams than everyone else is. He hasn't really done shit so far. Him being the centerpiece of a trade to get someone like Siakam or Wood seems like a longshot.
"Could probably get Marvin Bagley for DDJ + the 1st.   Siakam, Jermai Grant, and Christan Wood are probably getable if they include Patrick Williams."
"Bulls: 6-1. With solid wins against Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics. Our only loss was a one point loss to the Knicks. And we even had the ball at the end to try to win that game.  I'm really happy with how our new additions are playing: DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Derrick Jones Jr. They are hustling on offense and hustling on defense! I love how they play with a sense of urgency!  Special shoutout to Ayo Dosunmu who feels like an absolute steal at #38 draft. Especially since we didn't draft anyone before him this year. (Our first round draft pick was packaged in a deal to get Vucevic).  It sucks to lose Patrick Williams for the year. I hope he recovers from wrist injury as quickly as possible."
"Wiseman wouldn't be top 5 IMO. LaMelo, Ant, Haliburton, Maxey, and Bane would go over him I think. I'd also take Patrick Williams and Vassell over him personally."
"What spacing doubts were there to begin with anyways lol? Zach shot 42% on 8 attempts a game, Vucevic shot 40% on 6 attempts a game, Lonzo shot 39% on 8 attempts a game. Then you have Caruso, Patrick Williams who are both capable low to mid volume 3 point shooters."
They are already trying. Patrick Williams and Lavine both have gotten injured.
"Bane clearly better than 4 and 5 with a case for 3  Putting too much value on volume numbers on a bad team, efficiency on a good team is a lot more impressive  Would also definitely prefer Cole's potential (and current efficiency albeit very low sample this season) and probably like Patrick Williams to 4 &amp; 5 but you could reasonably prefer Bey to him I wouldn't care that much"
Patrick Williams at 4 or 5
Part of the fun in keeping in tune with the draft is seeing how people's stock can quickly rise or fall at the least minute.   Patrick Williams went from a lottery guy to #4 almost overnight. Similar thing to Scottie Barnes. Haliburton got criticized for a lot of things like wingspan and shooting form.
The Bulls have no bench and just lost Patrick Williams for the season
I think Ant and Melo will be stars. I can still see Wiseman becoming a star but he has a lot of developing to do. Patrick Williams could be a defensive star.
"Chicago has zero bench, missing Patrick Williams for the season and a suspect defense, most of the games they've played so far this season have  been against bad teams"
While being a decent defender. He is who I thought Patrick Williams would be
"My main qualm with the ""last year's rating"" stat people keep dropping is that we have three people still on the roster from the start of last season. That argument has gotten even worse with the recent injuries. Lavine (liability on defense), Coby White (hasn't played this year yet), Patrick Williams (out for season).  We've upgraded at perimeter defense, but downgraded the interior. Its a whole new squad essentially."
"Patrick Williams is a good young player but he's not some irreplaceable piece, bulls will be fine without him."
"Just realized that they are STACKED. If Patrick Williams could stay healthy and develop his game, boi the east is gonna have a problem"
Patrick Williams sprained for their sins!
"No real bigs, as Vucevic isn't considered good for rim protection. They also have no depth, a problem that's exaggerated by Patrick Williams being out for the year.  The poor expectations made sense on paper, but didn't count in everyone chipping in with energy. People like Lavine, Demar, and Vucevic had to exert it all on the offensive end as the #1 option, but now they don't have to bust ass on offense and sacrifice on the defensive end.  Then you have Lonzo and Caruso being huge additions and taking the brunt of the work"
"Please god, let that be the case. My worst fear is it is a Patrick Williams scenario"
"I totally understand you on this. On the other hand I don't feel like the Kings as constructed are a championship team, so what do we have to lose by playing him for 10 minutes? I guess we just saw what happened to Patrick Williams and everything gets a little weird. It just feels like he is too talented to be sitting on the sidelines."
"I’m the bulls, a team that is retooling, Patrick Williams is my player with highest upside. Easy choice to sell Lavine high for the 4th pick easy"
"You’re a 76ers fan so of course you would say drafts are a crapshoot.   The situation for this trade heavily weighs around who they tryna build around. Is it Patrick Williams, Colby White, Lauri Markanen and WCJ team? If Pat Williams is the franchise corner stone moving forward then you sell Lavine high and get assets"
Patrick Williams scored less than 14 ppg
Dude the situation low-key reminds me of Patrick Williams. Maybe that’s what the bulls are hoping by taking him that high.
"I know that kawhi comparison has been overused for years now to describe any wing prospect with a semblance of an offensive game, but Patrick Williams movement reminds me so much of kawhi. That dribbling into the midrange is super kawhi-esque."
"Why are the media ignoring Patrick Williams? He was one of the youngest players in the draft, has ideal NBA measurements and is already producing on both ends."
I feel that way about Patrick Williams. This season is a free pass cus hes so young
Clippers can pound sand we don't want luke Kanard or Lou Williams or Patrick Beverly or 2nd round pics
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."
"Bulls should be really solid imo, probably will be a 4th-6th seed and have a good chance of a good playoff run. The two big instruments to their success aside from the obvious like LaVine playing like he did last year will be the whole team improving defensively (especially LaVine and DeRozan) and Patrick Williams taking a bigger leap offensively. We know Lonzo, LaVine, Vucevic and DeRozan will be perfectly fine offensively, but Pat needs some work, so I’d really like to see DeRozan mentor Pat and help him become a better creator and just generally come more into his own as a scorer. If they manage to do both of those I have zero doubts they’ll find success"
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
With how good DeRozan's passing and playmaking had gotten I don't think it'll matter that Lavine isn't the best passer.  I'm excited to see how the Lonzo-Lavine-DeRozan-Patrick-Vucevic lineup does (assuming Patrick Williams develops enough to start) it seems spooky good on offense
"lol believe me I want to!  I'd *love* for him to prove me wrong.  It's not like Bulls have 0 plus defenders.  Lonzo is excellent off the ball, Caruso is pretty good on &amp; off, Patrick Williams has room to grow into one of the best defenders in the Association, and Zach LaVine is slightly above average on D nowadays."
"They have a good guard defender in lonzo and good wing defender in Patrick Williams. I don’t know their situation for bugs beside Vuc, but they have good defenders for the other positions"
"I gotta disagree with the “no Avenue to improve” idea. Patrick Williams, Lonzo, Zach all have the ability to grow as players, that’s 3/5 of our starting line up. By the times DeRozans contract is up, I can see CHI being a legit FA destination, which is pretty much the goal. This team is essentially building the foundation for a possible championship run in the near-ish future."
who under-delivered? The team that entered last year with a starting lineup of Coby White-Zach LaVine-Patrick Williams-Lauri Markkanen-Wendell Carter?
"Because only one of Caruso and ball are going to be on the floor. Lavine is still going to be playing most of the minutes and that limits how good the perimeter defense is going to be, especially with DeRozan at the 3.   Thaddeus Young was their only good forward defensively other than Patrick Williams, and DeRozan is an awful defender who's going to be playing a lot of minutes. They don't have Theis or Carter either, so Vuc is going to be asked for more defensively at center."
"Fourth year Jimmy Butler averaged 20/4/6 on 46/38/83 shooting while being an all-star, MIP, and second team all defense. If at the end of next year Patrick Williams is an all-star, MIP, second team all defense, and averages 11 more points a game, I will donate $50 to a charity of your choice"
He said not going to happen year 2. I’d bet dollars to donuts Patrick Williams never even sniffs an MVP vote
"And gave away Thaddeus young and are going to be starting DeRozan. Caruso and Lonzo aren't both going to play a bunch of minutes together, Lonzo is a good team defender and Caruso is an excellent point of attack defender, but there's a limit to how much you can do when Troy Brown and Patrick Williams are the only players on the roster bigger than guards who are decent defenders."
"Patrick Williams is the linchpin on whether this is a fun to watch 5 seed or a contender.   People are also giving up on White and Lauri too soon imo, but I do understand where they're coming from."
"DeRozan really does not matter if you watched any bulls games. Lauri/Coby were pretty bad on defense, Sato isnt amazing. Our best perimeter defenders was 19 year old Patrick Williams and old ass Garrett Temple. We literally have better defenders then last year and we were middle of the pack. Makes absolutely 0 sense that we get worse."
We were around 11-14th in defense this season and got better defenders then last year in Caruso and Lonzo. Our best perimeter defenders was 19 year old Patrick Williams and old ass Garrett Temple. How we going to be worse.
"And lost Theis, and Wendell Carter, and Garrett Temple, they're leaning extremely hard on Patrick Williams, Lonzo, and Caruso to provide defense here because Vuc, Lavine, and DeRozan aren't contributors there. Their defensive statistics last year were spared by bad defenders missing time."
"If Patrick Williams makes the leap to MVP caliber player this team is a contender. That’s not going to happen year 2.   In an ideal world for the Bulls, Williams is there by the time DeRozan’s contract is up, so offseason 2024. He’ll be up for an extension then too. Ball and LaVine will be in their primes and Bulls should have some pretty decent cap space to sign a star along with extending Williams.  That said, I’m fucking stoked for the upcoming year, haven’t been this excited for Bulls basketball since before Rose tore his ACL. Having two really good veterans in Vucevic and DeRozan will do a ton of good for our young core of Williams, Ball, and LaVine (hell, you can throw Lauri and Coby in there still too). As will playing meaningful games. The “perennial 6 seed comments” are short sighted. We’ve got a ways to go before we’re a contender, but there are paths there. Someone posted a starting lineup of Felicio, Zipser, Payne, Valentine, and I can’t remember who else in the Bulls sub yesterday. Anyone who would rather run lineups like that for the next decade and just pray some lotto balls drop in our favor doesn’t actually watch games."
"Patrick Williams is the x-factor here. Has all the talent in the world, just needs to put it all together"
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
Are the Bulls too obvious? They have 3 all stars with Patrick Williams and Lonzo Ball rounding out the starting 5. That's pretty good.
"**Offensively, they are a superb fit.**   Zach doesn't need the ball in his hands to do his thing, and for a lot of last season he did not because the Bulls were desperately trying to make PG Coby White work (it did not). When it wasn't Coby, the ball was often in Thaddeus Young's hands to be a playmaker. There is a reason why Bulls fans were so desperate for a PG.  You have to actually watch Lonzo to realise this, but Lonzo isn't a great point guard. He has great vision, but his subpar handle makes him struggle to playmake in the half court and in pick and roll. DeMar can do all of that at a high level. I don't see why you think the offence would stagnate with the ball in DeMar's hands - he's not a scorer that passes sometimes, he's legitimately a good primary playmaker. Lavine is someone who fits in the former category and the ball is definitely better in DeMar's hands for a team offense.   Caruso will be backup PG alongside Coby White, letting him go back to his natural role as a scorer and end the terrible PG experiment. They fit well together. Is 8m or whatever Caruso got too much for a backup PG? Maybe, but that's what they needed with Sato gone.   * Lonzo will thrive when he doesn't have to be the primary playmaker, and he can act as an elite glue guy offensively.  * Lavine will thrive going from 0 playmaking around him to 3-4 playmakers in the starting unit, and the best spacing he's ever had. * DeMar with thrive with 4 shooters around him, giving him space to operate. * Patrick Williams is a guy who can fit anywhere on any team, but we will see how improved he is next season. * Vuc will play with guys who can really collapse a defense and draw attention away from him for the first time in his career. He won't be getting doubled in the post with the shooting around him.  4/5 guys are very efficient offensive players, and I feel like each one of their starters is going into the best situation of their career.  Their bench is a little dicey atm and we need to see what moves they have planned, but I think the Caruso/Coby back court is a great fit.  **Defensively, they will be bad**  Chicago had really poor defensive schemes last year. Vucevic was a neutral defender in Orlando, mostly because Clifford's excellent defensive schemes and our mostly decent perimeter defenders were able to limit situations that were bad for him (i.e. Vuc was rarely caught out in an island guarding a small). Wendell Carter Jr was called a horrible defender by Chicago fans pre-trade, but the situations flipped after the trade. Wendell seemed like a pretty solid defender, if a little small, and Vuc was seen as a horrible defender. The difference is not in the players, but that the schemes in Chicago basically sacrifice the big because their perimeter defense was so bad. Rudy Gobert would be a neutral defender at best on last years Bulls. Lonzo and Caruso were upgrades, but I think they need a new defensive coordinator or something because a couple of good but not great guys aren't gonna fix it. DeMar and Lavine are bad defenders too.  Also to your point about 1on1 defenders, you are right but I think Patrick Williams can be that lockdown guy. He was decent but not great on defense, but that's to be expected for rookies. He has the tools to be a monster on that end.  I expect the Bulls to have one of the best offences in the league, especially if they can shore up their bench (maybe via S&amp;T for Lauri). Their defense will be bad, worse if they keep doing what they were doing last year. We will see I suppose."
depends how big of a step patrick williams makes. it's definitely a top 3 squad in the east tho
"Something is still missing and that is Bulls starting center.    With the Lonzo and Caruso acquisition, Coby is tradeable. AKME is planninh to trade Lauri and Coby IMO for that missing PF.   Bulls could very well package Patrick Williams along Coby and Lauri for a player that would put the Bulls over the top."
"I don’t think the Bulls will be as bad as everyone thinks on the defensive end.  Patrick Williams proved to be a capable defender already and he’ll hopefully get even better, and Zach has made the commitment to improve his defense, and he’s managed to improve every year since he’s come to Chicago. They may not be the bad boys bjt I don’t think teams will be able to do whatever they want to either."
"...have you heard of Patrick Williams? Were also one of the teams in on Danny Green, and will be acquiring another big before this is all wrapped up."
Patrick Williams?
Patrick Williams
"How does he not fit...? Ball shoots 39% from 3, Lavine 42%, Vucevic 40%, Patrick Williams 39%. This is just the starting line-up. Who gives a fuck if DeRozan can't shoot? Literally everyone around him can shoot. The Bulls lacked playmaking and DeRozan has been fantastic on that side of the ball (better than Ball in a half court set). He is also elite at getting to the line which is something the Bulls desperately need because Lavine doesn't get the calls. People who say this move doesn't fit, just don't know the Bulls at all"
"Patrick Williams will be like two Kawhis put together, guuaaa-rraaannnn-teeeed"
it’d be cool af if patrick williams ended up having an insane jump this year and pulling an early spurs kawhi-esque come up. someone who has watched more bulls pls tell me if that’s remotely posting
Last year  Lonzo was 378  Vucevic was 39  Lavine was 41  Patrick Williams was 39  So must not have spacing issues if these hold up
"I truly think it could run anywhere from ""bottom 5 in the league"" to ""actually pretty decent"". Billy Donovan's been able to coach defense before, but it's gonna depend a lot on how much their three stars buy in, what other defensive role players they can get, and what Patrick Williams' development looks like— Lonzo and Caruso are good defensive guards, but they aren't game-changing defensive anchors. Paw has that sort of potential, but I'm not sold on him being that guy just yet."
"Not quite sure of some of the Spurs' off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner). They preferred going for Jimmy Butler and some cheaper bigs like Millsap and Bro-Lo. Either that or wait a year for Durant in 2016.  - drafting Primo over Moody, Alperen or Kai Jones  - drafting Vassell over Halliburton   Pop's best bet to secure the future would actually be to play all the young guys hard but try and somehow tank for Victor Wembanyama or Emoni Bates."
"He deserves to go out whichever way he chooses.   Although, not quite sure of some of their off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner).

This is great for the league. The bulls might win 50 games this year. Patrick Williams is lost in all of this but he's also really good. I think they'll probably want Derozan guarding the PF spot since he can't seem to hang defensively with shifty guards. With Lonzo and Williams guarding wings or shifty guards they'll be able to cover a lot of Lavine and Derozan's faults. Vooch will happily chuck up threes in the pick and pop and there will be a ton of room for Lavine and Derozan to bully teams inside. This is gonna be fun.   I have faith that Billy Donovan can get this group all on the same page. It's funny he left OKC because he didn't want to rebuild. And then went to a rebuilding Bulls team. Someone must have assured him they were willing to shell out for talent in the near future.
Having a high upside young forward makes me love this move all the more - I think he will be great for patrick williams
"Gotta start somewhere, feel like with lonzo and Zach (also Patrick williams) on the come up they gonna start being better every year."
"Unless Patrick Williams improves a ton, Derozan becomes a different player, and Vucevic stops his slide into uselessness, I don't see how they finish anywhere near the top 5."
"Yeah everyone is shitting on them but Patrick Williams is the key. If he can hide DeRozan then I think Ball and Lavine will be fine at the guard slots, and Vuc is not bad. Caruso will shore up the bench. They should be average defensively imo.       Would like to see them add a defensive big though."
"Yeah the Vucevic trade baffled me. Patrick Williams is barely 20, Coby white needs time too, although with Lonzo I guess he'll probably be running the bench unit. Theis and Felicio hopefully aren't coming back, we'll see what happens to markkanen.  Bulls lack a real inside presence. Vucevic is definitely getting traded in a year or two, he's too old and expensive and doesn't play inside"
"Uh, pretty sure Patrick Williams and Caruso are two of the better young defenders in the league. Troy Brown Jr. is also literally on the team to play good defense + Lavine's lack of defense is overrated, as you're seeing in the Olympics.  Nice armchair analyst though bud."
"I think the Bulls thing could go really well *or* really poorly. There's a lot of firepower on that team, but they gave up a lot of future assets for it and they're gonna be relying a *lot* on Patrick Williams and Lonzo to carry the defense. Then again, even worst-case scenario I doubt they fall out of the playoffs, and given how bad the Bulls have been the last five years or so maybe that's worth it by itself"
And this isn't even considering future Bulls best player Patrick Williams
Hated seeing theis go... Patrick Williams could develop into that guy. Didn't we pick up javale McGee or was that just talks? He'd def help w rim protection... Will be interesting. Team is def better now though
Nobody wants Lauri.  We literally benched Lauri. Patrick Williams is the power forward.
They will be interesting. Patrick Williams is the X-Factor there.
Its funny how only non-bulls fans think Lauri is part of the future. Patrick Williams will be a 100x better starting 4
"You probably are right but they look great on paper, gotta see what happens with Markennen and if Patrick Williams takes another step"
Zach has become a much better 1 on 1 defender than what he was he’s still not good at help defense at all and vuc while he’s okay is not much in D  Aside from lonzo and Caruso watch out for Patrick Williams. The dude is going to be an insane 2 way player someday
Dude and if Patrick Williams lives up to the kawhi Leonard comparable holy fuck
Sorry you guys have so many first round picks on dudes not even in the age range of Lavine.  You’d probably be better off signing Lonzo and building around Zo Lavine and Patrick Williams.
They don't know yet but they will soon. Patrick Williams is going to be an absolute killer.
"Lonzo D Ball, Alex D Caruso, Patrick D Williams.  They all gonna die happy."
Likely Patrick Williams instead of Lauri
"Lonzo, Caruso, and Patrick Williams? Need a big tho for sure"
No clue if the bulls will be good but they will be interesting with derozan lonzo Lavine vucevic and Patrick Williams
Patrick. Williams.
"patrick williams, coby white, caruso, this a teaaaaam"
Bulls fans – would you rather have Patrick Williams at the 4 in this lineup? Too soon?
And Patrick williams
Don’t forget Patrick Williams
"I wonder how this affects Patrick Williams development. He’ll for sure be taking a lot less shots now. Bulls fans, does he come of the bench now or what?"
who’s the starting power forward on the bulls this upcoming season ? Patrick Williams ?
who’s the starting power forward on the bulls this upcoming season ? Patrick Williams ?
They can actually get Derozan ans still have Patrick Williams and Coby white. Markanen and a 2022 1st should be enough to grab Derozan.   Lonzo- Derozan- Levine-Thad-Vucevic   Then if I’m them I trade Coby White and/or Patrick Williams for Christian Wood
"There's still a shot that maybe Patrick Williams grows into a legit 3rd tier guy, or Levine goes up another level to 2nd tier and that's enough to get the Bulls up to that Contender level. Without a true carry star like Giannis or KD, or without one of those next ring down guys like Jokic, Harden, Lillard, AD, LeBron (now), Paul, or Embiid, you're just not going to win a title"
"He'd probably play the 4, which is what he did during a good chunk of his time on the Spurs.  Basically doing the Thad Young role (not a great shooter but surprisingly solid as a facilitator) only upgraded. The hope is that having a legit stretch 5 next to DeMar helps with the spacing.  I gotta admit; Lonzo/LaVine/Patrick Williams/DeMar/Vooch is a strange, strange lineup but it'll be fun to watch. You're basically doing a playmaking-by-committee approach there."
"4 years 85 is not bad for Lonzo, he is a good defender who can switch 1-3, has dramatically improved his outside shooting, and fills the biggest hole they had on their roster. Not exactly sure why trying to trade Lauri is a bad thing when they have Patrick Williams who needs minutes at the same position for cheaper. Billy D is ok, definitely worse coaches out there."
"Rumor is 4th year is non guaranteed and the 3rd year is only partially guaranteed. So if he is ass by then it wouldn't impact us.  You guys, on the other hand, are locked into a core of Lavine, Vuc, Lonzo, and Patrick Williams. Your peak is a 4 seed and a second round exit in the east"
"I like the fit with Lonzo and Levine.  Very complimentary pair in a starting backcourt.  Plus Vuc, and Patrick Williams devolping more should make them fairly competitive.  If Coby White can become a bit more consistent shooting wise off the bench, they could become a pretty good team.  I like it.  I'm a Bucks fan, but the NBA is better when the Bulls don't stink."
"What we're doing right now is praying that Patrick Williams becomes a star lol. I'm not mad at this tbh, I know we're not going anywhere but at least I'd like to see Zach in Chicago with a halfway decent team around him."
"Patrick Williams and… Coby White!!! He knows not to foul the three point shooter, right? *Right?*"
"&gt; Its not a sweeping generalization  It definitely is though.  &gt; literally half the roster could be replaced by g-league players and we'd barely see a difference  If you believe that you're lost. If you're exaggerating then it's definitely still a sweeping generalisation.   I don't know why you are disagreeing with me on behalf of a guy that knows nothing about the bulls. I never said we could make a deep playoff run right now. Obviously, I would like us to but so would the other 29 teams.  For now, we just have to keep Zach and then see where Vuc, Zach and a PG gets us. Still got pretty high hopes for Patrick Williams too."
Patrick Williams is probably there
Patrick Williams
"WE already failed one rebuild, 2 failed 7th picks. You hope Lonzo grows and trade him and Patrick Williams down the line for a 3rd star would be the best way to keep Lavine happy."
Were pretty high on Patrick Williams
Really? You have Vucevic at the 5 and you can play Patrick Williams at the 4.  Doesn't seem like you need to keep Young.
The Bulls were on-track to make the playoffs until Zach Lavine got into a late Health and safety protocol. They will have one full off-season with Billy Donovan (new coach last season) and also some time to gel with Vucevic who arrived with 1/3rd of the quarter left. The Bulls will potentially be rolling out a line up of Lonzo/Lavine/Patrick Williams/Thad/Vucevic as their starting 5. That's better than the Pacers and Knicks on paper.
"If Patrick Williams and Coby White continue to develop well, Bulls could be pretty good then. Good mix of offense and defense between their core."
"it's really weird watching Patrick Williams play. he has terrific fundamentals and has no problem shedding defenders and getting to the midrange/layup land. however he really struggles on playing through contact despite the fact that he has a grown mans size and muscular build.   that being said, he shoots a great percentage from pretty much everywhere, but just hardly takes any shots. from his offseason videos it seems like he has sped up his game and jumper and should be more involved with the offense this year. the nice thing about him is that even when he isn't shooting he still has a great impact on the defensive end of the floor. it allows him to learn and develop as a player without being a total negative on the court.  very excited about his future"
Patrick Williams. he was a sleeping giant last year and I think he's gonna start taking more opportunities this year
"I would love Lonzo, but if we lose Thad and Theis because of it there could be problems. what happens if vucavic gets hurt? we wouldn't really have any big guys to replace him. Patrick Williams might be serviceable, but still. seems like we are stocking up on PG, but depleting our interior.   it'll be interesting to see how the FO tries to add back depth there"
Patrick Williams? Kid is 19 still lol younger than a lot of lotto picks this year
"PJ Washington, Patrick Williams, Jordan Poole"
Patrick Williams will make a huge leap in year two
"You’d know better than me, curious why do you say that? Patrick Williams would be the only player in their starting 5 on a rookie contract. They made all-in moves at the deadline last year."
"sure. but he leaned about as heavily into his killian hayes take as i've ever seen any analyst on any platform, ever.  combine that with the rest of his board... he was very high on devin vassell, very low on patrick williams, wildly high on tyrell terry... all of his bold takes look like total misses so far. you're right that it's too early to judge, though.  and again, i actually think he's worth paying attention to regardless. everyone misses. not everyone is bold enough to have an independent take."
Everyone had the same freak out over Patrick Williams last draft &amp; by seasons end he was copping Kawhi comps &amp; having LeBron &amp; KD say they didn't enjoy being defended by him &amp; he's special. People jump the gun so quickly.
This time last year everyone was bitching that the Bulls reached on Patrick Williams and then by then end of the season he's drawing comps to Kawhi Leonard.   I'm an FSU alum and watched every game this year. Barnes is an athletic marvel with great basketball IQ and a clutch gene. I also don't think his shot is as broken as many are saying. You're going to be real happy with him this year just wait.
"it's also a product of how FSU limits players from being ""The Guy"". Patrick Williams is also an FSU alum. So Barnes FG% wasn't amazing but he didn't even take too many shots."
"That's basically the same thing that happened to Patrick Williams last year. I guess when you're young,  have his size, &amp; defensive potential your stock is gonna rise"
"It’s not a bad pick by any means, I just feel like we have enough wings and need a future PG to replace Lowry. They didn’t go totally off the board and if Barnes is like Patrick Williams, I’ll be thrilled with the pick."
"Raw athletic wing players? Off the top of my head: Patrick Williams, Jaylen Brown, Cam Reddish, Kevin Knox."
"Barnes is going to be freaking legit. Ppl hated on Patrick Williams last year, and it's the same archetype... except that Barnes is better. That's not a bad pick"
"This, I had no idea who Patrick Williams was when the Bulls drafted him. I fucking love him now."
"I really wish GM's were more forward thinking. I'd love to have Patrick Williams, Kuminga, Wiseman, 14th pick, 3 future Warriors picks, and Andrew Wiggins to teach them all how to become a man.  Instead KarPax is going to ride Lavine/Vucevic to mediocriLand."
It probably isn't that bad? Scottie is an incredible defensive player. Definitely not a bust and the raptors clearly value defensive versatility.  Patrick Williams had a similar reaction last season and that pick looks very good right now
Scottie is a jump shot away from being a more athletic type of Cade Cunningham prospect. He was always going to rise with the draft workouts.  It can be hard to pin down FSU players because we usually like to go 12 deep. So Patrick Williams and now Scottie Barnes end up not playing quite as much as they might elsewhere.
Very similar to his FSU brother Patrick Williams last yr  Also went fourth to a team with red white and black colors. And they're both wings  Crazy!
"For the second straight season, a 6’8” wing from FSU with underwhelming raw stats goes #4. I liked Patrick Williams last year but idk if I like Barnes anywhere near as much."
"As an FSU fan I can tell you he was better for us than his stats lead you to believe. Under Leonard Hamilton’s system, you can’t judge a player by their PPG. A top prospect playing at FSU will always have less eye-popping stats than players of a similar caliber at other schools because Leonard likes a rotation of 11+ guys vs 7 at other schools. He also doesn’t believe in “feeding the hot hand” and, sometimes to fan chagrin, is not above subbing the team’s best player out if he believes it’s for the good of the team. You can take a look at Jonathan Isaac and Patrick Williams’ stats as further examples of this phenomenon. I truly believe that Leonard and his staff are great at scouting and developing talent (see Trent Forrest, Terrance Mann, and Kabengele) but these recruits will never be given as much of a spotlight as they would receive at schools with shallower benches.  Scottie was the floor general for us last year as a freshman and did a pretty good job of it."
bro chill it's just patrick williams lol
"It is too early to talk about a trade but our options at 4 are DeRozan, Javonte Green and Alize Johnson right now. I don't know if that's tenable for a full season.  Hopefully he'll come back better than ever, that's all I care about right now. I still believe in Patrick Williams and his future is gonna be bright."
Coby White and Patrick Williams for Christian Wood
Lmao did the Knicks commentator just call Patrick Williams a bust???
Our 2nd year player Patrick Williams has a very high arching shot.
He's kind of the Patrick Williams of this draft. Been rising like crazy in the past few days.
"4th overall for the best defender in the class, some of the best physical tools in the draft besides Mobley and Kuminga, and the potential Scottie has? I could see it. The defensive versatility in Scottie OG and Siakim is crazy.  Also Patrick Williams was a surprise at 4 last year and that pick looks very solid so far"
"FSU really raising people’s draft stock, first Patrick Williams now Barnes"
THIS YEAR'S PATRICK WILLIAMS
"Herb Jones to the Bulls at 38 would be nice, nice compliment to Patrick Williams."
Whoever does the PR for the guys coming out FSU does a great job...same exact thing happened with Patrick Williams last year. Went from a mid lottery pick to top 5 level player in about a week
Hes Patrick Williams without as good of a midrange game. PWill was seen as a reach at number 4 so I think 5th-7th is probably fair.
"He has the tools and athleticism of guys like Draymond, Kawhi, and more recently, Patrick Williams, but the poor decision making of Kyle Kuzma"
"Patrick Williams was also a bench player coming into his rookie season, and people were surprised when he went 4th but he ended up being one of the better rookies."
Patrick Williams is a much better prospect than Barnes honestly. Barnes is a zero on offence. He’s basically a worse Simmons
so was patrick williams and he has an high upside
Patrick Williams.   Other teams Halliburton. I admittedly never watch the Kings but I saw people saying he could’ve been ROTY
"Zeke Nnaji, and PJ obviously  Other teams - Patrick Williams, Malik Monk, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane"
"Bro.....my evidence is that it's a sport. Do you really need evidence that most fans would rather have their teams be good, making the playoffs and finals, adding star players? You're just playing dumb at this point although the ""playing"" part is debatable. I've already made my point about teams saying profitable too btw.  And nope, wrong again. we at least have some young prospects in Patrick Williams and Coby White that could be our future core while also having win now guys in Lavine, Vooch and it all depends on what happens next year in free agency. If it goes to shit and we tank, good! I'd rather have that than cling into a middling at best roster for years wasting people's time."
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
Oh I had him mistaken for Patrick Williams lol. Yeah I could definitely see him breaking out in a way although I’m not really that sure about his offensive game.
No Chicago didn’t give him playing time because they already had WCJr and Patrick Williams at the 4/5.
2020 - Patrick Williams - Bulls   2019 De’Andre Hunter – Hawks   2018 Jaren Jackson Jr - Grizzlies   2017 Josh Jackson  – Suns   2016 Dragan Bender - Suns   2015 Kristaps Porzingis - Knicks   2014 Aaron Gordon  – Magic   2013 Cody Zeller - Bobcats   2012 Dion Waiters - Cavaliers   2011 Tristan Thompson - Cavaliers   2010 Wesley Johnson - Timberwolves   I wouldn’t trade Ben for a decade of number four picks now that the unicorn has vanished.
"Chicago could trade for him. Patrick Williams, Coby White, Satoransky, Aminu, and 2 FRP works.  Not sure if it's a great idea, but Lavine, Beal, and Vucevic should theoretically give a good offense at the very least. Would be pretty thin roster wise, but would have Thaddeus Young, could re-sign Lauri, and work on bringing in some cheaper veterans to round out the roster."
"Fwiw, some stats from recent years:  2020 draft   * Edwards: 19.3/4.7/2.9 on 41.7/32.9/77.6 splits * Wiseman: 11.5/5.8/0.7 on 51.9/32.6/62.8 * Lamelo: 15.7/5.9/6.1 on 43.6/35.2/75.8 * Patrick Williams: 9.2/4.6/1.4 on 48.3/39.1/72.8  2019  * Zion: 22.5/6.3/2.1 on 58.3/42.8/64 splits  * Ja: 17.8/3.9/7.3 on 47.7/33.5/77.6  * RJ: 14.3/5/2.6 on 40.2/32/61.4 * Hunter: 12.3/4.5/1.8 on 41/35.5/76.4  2018 (doing 5 here to get Luka and Trae)  * Ayton: 16.3/10.3/1.8 on 58.5/no 3s/74.6 * Bagley: 14.9/7.6/1 on 50.4/31.3/69.1 * Doncic: 21.2/7.8/6 on 42.7/32.7/71.3 * JJJ: 13.8/4.7/1.1 on 50.6/35.9/76.6 * Trae: 19.1/3.7/8.1 on 41.8/32.4/82.9  2017 (note Fultz played only 14 games)  * Fultz: 7.1/3.1/3.8 on 40.5/no 3s/47.6 * Lonzo: 10.2/6.9/7.2 on 36/30.5/45.1 * Tatum: 13.9/5/1.6 on 47.5/43.4/82.6 * Josh Jackson: 13.1/4.6/1.5 on 41.7/26.3/63.4  Couple things that stand out to me. Top 4 picks have historically not been great free throw shooters out of the gate. Only Trae (who isn’t technically a top 4 pick) and Tatum shot at least 80% from the line of the 17 guys mentioned and neither of them made 83%. Since the 2010 draft, the only top 4 draft picks who’ve hit that mark were Kyrie and Porzingis.   Also theres a trade off with volume and efficiency. Zion shot 14 total attempts from 3 so leaving him out. Only Tatum and Patrick Williams shot at least 37% from 3 and they scored 13.9 and 9.2 ppg. And of the guys above with at least 18 ppg, their 3pt%s ranged from 32.4 - 32.9%."
"I’m curious what happens with Chicago.  They only have three players under contract after this next season: Vucevic (22M), Patrick Williams (7.5M), Coby White (7.5M).  (Note: That might change if they resign Markannen or Thad this off-season) They can max Zach LaVine and still have money available, but they would essentially be paying more money for the same team they have now.   I’m sure they’re not anywhere close to trading Zach, but if the beginning of the season goes badly, I think they would have to seriously consider where they are headed as a franchise and consider trading LaVine and Vucevic for all the assets they can get."
Patrick Williams
"Patrick Williams baby also Lavine is hungry, all star isn't enough."
"We have Patrick williams that looks like a promising wing on both ends of the court. I actually think with lowry we can be better than Atlanta. There isn’t any reason why we can’t be with Lavine, vooch and lowry"
"No. We *might* have our own versions of Booker/Bridges/Ayton with Lavine/Patrick Williams/Vooch, but Lowry is no CP3 and Paw is too raw. Plus in the bubble last year PHO started to show major improvement, which is something we haven't done yet, even before they added CP3."
"I mean, Markannen is probably gone, Patrick Williams was already a promising defender last year and will only improve, Thaddeus Young's a good defender, Aminu's a solid defender, and it's not like filling the rest of the roster out with solid defenders is the hardest thing to do in FA."
The East is also a little easier than the west though so from a standing perspective it might have a big impact. The Bulls have needed a proper point guard since Derrick Rose. They have 2 all-star calibre players and some young talented pieces in Coby and Patrick Williams. It'll be hard but i can see it happening.
Anthony edwards Patrick williams Tatum Yup thats pretty much it..
I hope this trend continues bc he was praising my guy Patrick Williams earlier this season lol
