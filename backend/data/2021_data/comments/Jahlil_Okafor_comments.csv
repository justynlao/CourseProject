Tyreke in his rookie year was legit a great player and had one of the best rookie years ever. I feel Trubisky is maybe more like Jahlil Okafor (looked somewhat passable stats wise at first but clearly became clear he wasnt the guy)
"I mean yeah, but it’s mostly loud ass Sixers fans saying it. The same clowns who were talking down to everyone who said Jahlil Okafor was be better than Jokic 5 years ago. Jokic is one of the most direct and physical players in the league but people are acting like he’s CP3 out there, dude just forces his way to the basket like 10+ times a game. Yes Embiid would get a few more FTs, but maybe like 10 v 8, nothing close to the current 12 v 4.5 split. And generally people who don’t watch both regularly overstate the difference between the two in physicality."
"You aren’t familiar with the elite tier spacing that Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, and Jahlil Okafor were providing Blake early this season so that nobody was clogging the lane defensively?"
How is he anything like Jahlil Okafor or the situation.
"Rui's fine. He isn't exceeding expectations, but he isn't underperforming, either. Outside of his defense, I don't see anything that makes him better than say, year 2 of Jahlil Okafor, other than the fact that he can hit wide open threes.  That isn't necessarily a diss, Okafor was picked 2nd overall for a reason - he was ""NBA ready"", like Hachimura, and both dudes put up a bunch of 20 point games early in their careers.  But Hachimura has work to do if he's going to exceed that expecation, and his foul-rate/handle/off-the-dribble-3 just isn't there yet."
"For perspective, NBA superstars Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker carried there Wisconsin team to an NCAA championship where they lost to a squad of absolute league legends Jahlil Okafor, Justice Winslow, Tyus Jones, and Quinn Cook."
5 years ago Sixers fans were completely confident Jahlil Okafor would be better by now
"The draft status of player means nothing once they have been in the league and teams have been able to see what they are like/might become.  Anthony Bennett, Derrick Williams, Kidd-Gilchrist, Jahlil Okafor, Josh Jackson, etc. (Probably Bagley?) Were all recent top picks that became pretty worthless assets within 1 or 2 years in the league."
lol - it's not an ignorant statement. People think that every young player will get a little bit better each year until ages 27-28. That's simply not the case. Jahlil Okafor would be a Top 5 center at that rate. The reality is you thought Dennis Smith was destined to be a future All-Star after he averaged 15PPG his rookie year. You were wrong. It's looking more and more like that was his peak - and he'll be out of the NBA in the next 2-3 years if something doesn't drastically change.
"I remember when that used to be a HOT take. Now kind of crazy to think people ever thought KAT was really better straight up. Not to take away from KAT who is super good and slept on... but Jokic is the MVP favorite lol.   And ppl wonder why long time Jokic/Nuggets fans have a chip on their shoulder, it seems like every year it’s considered a clown take to put Jokic &gt; some guy, and then in a year the narrative totally flips and the comparison sounds ridiculous.   Remember this legendary Jahlil Okafor &gt; Jokic consensus thread?"
"It doesn't make sense to weigh in on any trends, a 5-10 game sample size is stupid even recently or at the start of the season  You should look at an entire season, there have been 50 games played by him   Jahlil Okafor averaged 20ppg on 60% shooting in his last 10 games as a rookie, what do you think?"
"Giannis was a #15 pick and was a wiry strong physically underdeveloped 6'9 player, playing on some no name team in Greece. He wasn't a known entity like Jahlil Okafor or KAT.  Bucks picking Giannis and Giannis being MVP was luck on the Bucks end. Hardwork and God Given talent on Giannis end.  At best Giannis was supposed to be like Nicholas Batum or Toronto TMac,  a big do it all wing that could help a contending team. Giannis developed fast given he his experience level. His first year he stood in the corner  and ran the floor. By his second year he was a starter, by his third year he broke out. That's a normal trajectory for a non-top 3 pick that isn't expected to be a star.  Giannis always had motor, instincts and athleticism with guard like fluidity in a big body. He never looked completely lost. James Wiseman looks like he doesn't even belong on the floor. You don't want your number 2 pick being the worst player in the league.  James Wiseman is the 2nd worst offensive player on the Warriors. Only Brad Wanamaker is worse and Wanamaker is a 31 year old Gleague caliber player that only shoots 3 and drive right.  James Wiseman looks terrible."
Guys like him and Jahlil Okafor would have fit in way better if they were drafted a decade or 2 earlier
"Very good post game player which is now obsolete in this league   Doesn’t help that he’s very slow movement wise. Definitely not a bad player, but it’s pretty much here the same problem Jahlil Okafor has."
"Depending on how far you wanna go back, I’d go Sixers.   For this exercise, I’m assuming only they get the power of foresight. Just for a quick primer, not getting to deep into late picks and such:  Draft Devin Booker instead of Jahlil Okafor  Draft Tatum at 1, or trade back from 3 with Sacramento for 5 and 10 (was a rumored possibility at the time) and take 2 of Fox/Mitchell/Bam.  And then instead of drafting Zhaire Smith, draft SGA.  Additionally, they’d retain some selection of Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, Covington, Saric, etc. to fill out the team with those new guys, Ben, and Joel."
Lmao jahlil okafor vibes man
"""You know my name?!? I'm Jahlil Okafor!"" proceeds to throw hands  I think Porzingis and his bro beat up some people at a bar before going to the mavs also"
"&gt; Would've been rated higher and would've won rings.  The rings would've depended on who he had around him, and who he had to go up against (Russ ain't beating MJ's Bulls IMO), but yeah, I absolutely wouldn't rule it out.    Someone needs to put together a 'would've fucked everyone up in the 90s' team.  Westbrook, Jahlil Okafor, idk who else."
Tyreke Evans  Jabari Parker  Otto Porter Jr  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlens Noel
This comment is almost as dumb as the people who think Jahlil Okafor would have dominated the 90s.
"As someone who is a sixer fan and sat through those teams, and who liked Hinkie as well, this really gets misremembered. When Silver sat down with Sixers management, it was not just the third year in the Sixers rebuild , but it was their worst year yet. The Sixers began that year losing 26 straight games, and having watched a lot of those games-they looked absolutely awful. I remember thinking that team could absolutely have gone winless during that streak. But it wasn’t just the losing. Jahlil Okafor had gotten into a fight with fans in Boston. The players association was considering filing a complaint against Hinkie on the grounds of predatory contracts. It was three years and there wasn’t a single player on the roster that looked like they had a bright future (remember Embiid still was sitting due to injury). I wouldn’t have fired Hinkie then but I can certainly respect how it would be on the forefront of their minds."
Two words: Jahlil Okafor
"Never really watched college ball like that, the only year I did, I ended up thinking jahlil okafor was going to be a stud in the league given he was that great at duke"
Markelle Fultz  Michael Carter Williams  Larry Hughes  Jahlil Okafor  Shawn Bradley
In terms of moves Jahlil Okafor.
"Hey Riley, Isaac Bonga, Mo Bamba, and Jahlil Okafor are a on the block. Make the calls."
"He's a good player, he's not Jahlil Okafor 2.0 or anything like that."
"Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor, for me"
"Also some obvious picks don't pan out as well and aren't actually obvious picks in hindsight, i.e. the Andrew Bogut vs Marvin Williams for #1 pick in 2005, Michael Beasley and Derrick Williams at #2, Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014, Jahlil Okafor in 2016, etc."
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
"Jahlil Okafor. Had he been in the league 10 years earlier, he would’ve been solid. But his game was back to the basket, post ups. Also he was in a terrible situation with Philly, because Embiid finally was healthy and was dominating. I remember KAT vs Okafor was a big thing, and I was riding with Okafor. Turned out I am not meant to be GM."
"Marshon brooks, Rodrigue beabouis, Rudy Fernandez, jahlil okafor, Jabari"
"Yeah, my only process regret was picking Jahlil Okafor over Kristaps. Everything else has worked fairly well."
7 years? So you think Fultz still has a chance to be the best player in his draft? NBA is a cutthroat business for players who take too long to develop. Jahlil fucking Okafor was drafted 6 years ago. You still think he’s gonna be an All Star?
Jahlil Okafor
I'd say a player like Jahlil Okafor was better suited for the 90s/00s. The need for a big man to shoot wasn't as prevalent.
Jahlil Okafor in the 90s  Ben Simmons in the 80s/90s
"Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond, Enes Kanter, Greg Monroe, Steven Adams, Allen Iverson"
Jahlil Okafor
"He snuck on the third team one time lmao and has never been a DPOY finalist. He’s not that good. The nets sucking isn’t a pipe dream, it’s highly unlikely harden/kyrie/kd run it back after contracts are over, the lifespans of super teams are shorter then you think.  Why would the rockets not sniff the playoffs? They were in the mix until there best player went down and oladipo as missed like every game which is why we’re playing so bad.   Ben Simmons with John wall would have been a disaster.  I do know how difficult it is to be a playoff team, which is why I said simmons isn’t worth it. At best simmons leads us to a early 4-1 exit in the first round.  The sixers were also shit at drafting. They traded an extra asset to get fultz for tatum, and then drafted jahlil okafor lmfao.  Simmons is not a top 15 player, you’re out of your mind lol. Off the top of my head in no order:  Lebron, AD, harden, kyrie, kd, embiid, giannis, middleton, sabonis, Tatum, brown, butler, bam, Trae, vuc, beal, towns, shai, wood, zion, luka, steph, jokic, dame, booker, kawhi, PG are all better players and I’m probably missing a bunch. He’s not that good."
"Bron becomes unguardable, 90s rules cancel a lot of the 2011 Mavs blueprint for stopping him.  Doncic is big and crafty enough with his moves around the basket, I think he'd be okay too.  The change in pace makes slower bigs like Jahlil Okafor and Boban instant quality starters."
Jahlil Okafor roll outta bed and get 20/10
"It’s hard not to take that Pippen comment as hyperbole when followed with saying it was an era of basketball where Jahlil Okafor would be a top 5 guy. We’re talking an era of centers that had Ewing, Olajuwon, Shaq, Robinson, Zo, Smits, Mutumbo, etc.  And that’s just centers."
"I didn't say 2nd best but it's not so outrageous. We're talking about an era of basketball where Jahlil Okafor would probably be called top 5, and draymond green wouldn't be in the league unless he fucked people up more than he currently does"
"Prime Rose, Blake, Jerami Grant, Josh Jackson, rookie Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, Wayne Ellington. The Pistons would go from the worst team in the East to a playoff team, but I don't think they would have been title contenders."
"What's funny about this whole thing is you have people like OP caping for liek .1% of the league who pulls this shit. And every single time, it's players at the tippity top who are demanding trades and acting out. I feel bad for players like Shaun Livingston, Deron Williams, Brandon Roy, John Wall, or Jahlil Okafor. Players who actually suffered because of the game, but stayed professional and ran with what they got."
"Everyone saying ""Bates and Holmgren have crazy potential, obviously them"" -- remember when Andrew Wiggins was the second coming? When Jahlil Okafor was the next MVP Center? Highly touted prospects with insane ""potential"" bust all the time. You take Mitchell and Robinson any day of the week."
"I mean Jahlil Okafor isn't great either. There's a shortage of C options out there relative to the amount of teams that need help, and Drummond is known to be available."
JAHLIL OKAFOR: IS A CENTRE
"I don’t remember if we lost 50 games, but the 2018-2019 second half of the season Pels were a lot of fun to watch. The roster sans AD was Jrue and a bunch of scrappy guys including Jahlil Okafor, Kenny Hustle, Stanley Johnson, Dairis Bertans, Ian Clark, Frank Jackson and Christian Wood (😥).   I remember we beat Denver and Utah on the road then got 40 pieced by Orlando. Good times."
"I still have Jahlil Okafor stock. 😣  New Tim Duncan, they said"
I thought Jahlil Okafor was going to be a superstar
"&gt; I haven't been this sure a top prospect would disappoint or outright bust since Jahlil Okafor five years ago.  &gt; I can't figure out why, in this era of 3-point shooting and defensive switching, anybody would want a guard who can't shoot straight, can't defend anybody, and isn't a freak athlete that can keep up on defense due to sheer natural skill.  &gt; Sure you can go without one of those three things, maybe even two if you're insanely good at the other skill. But being subpar in all three areas is a massive no no for a guard. He better be a prime Jason Kidd level playmaker otherwise he's not worth starting anywhere in the league.  &gt; He's a notably worse prospect than Lonzo was, and that didn't turn out well either.  -- Hornets fan in the comments"
I bet you’d take Draymond over Jahlil Okafor too right😂😂😂
Same people that confidently said Jahlil Okafor was way better than Jokic ever would be after their rookie year
"RAPTOR is already fairly reliable but I bet the more reliable EPM and DARKO don't match your eye test either. The eye test is overrated - eye testers were constantly yelling about how Jahlil Okafor would be so much better than Jokic. Eye testers don't look at off ball play and undervalue rebounding, interior defense, and playmaking, and always overrate decent players on terrible teams."
"Mine was jahlil Okafor. A lot of people gave up on him and Nerlens when they were in philly, and I wanted okafor to succeed hella bad cuz I actually like the traditional big man. Obviously it didn’t work out 😂"
"Does anyone else remember that clip where Richaun Holmes, Jahlil Okafor, and some dude who is out of the league we're holding up their new Sixers jerseys (back when they were one of the worst teams in the league)  They smile for a picture and after the picture Okafor immediately drops the jersey and looks super unenthusiastic, granted the era angle made it look worse than it was  Holmes has a genuine ""I'm just happy to be here"" on his face, then he looks over and sees Okafor do that and immediately stops smiling  Ever since then I've rooted for Holmes because I felt kinda bad for him, and now look out how their careers have turned out lol"
"This has nothing to do with the post, but this is the first post I’ve ever seen about him so I need to use it.  Daniel Theis is my least favorite player of all time. He has the skill of Jahlil Okafor and whines like he’s Lebron. I have never seen a single play where that dude wasn’t complaining or talking to a ref about something. His team could score a 3 pointer, the other team gets a double tech, they make all their free throws, and Theis will be complaining to a ref and throwing a fit the entire time about god knows what.  Thank you for finally giving me a platform to talk about this guy."
Maybe they’ll make a Jahlil Okafor multiverse where Wisemen &amp; Bagley can share the role together
Thank god they took Jahlil Okafor 2.0 over LaMelo or else we’d be really fucked
"It's more believable that a first time gm with no FO experience who was only hired as a player relations guy because the league thought jahlil okafor was going to fist fight every chowderhead in boston, lucked into a GM role and made a bunch of dumb moves with ownership input, than josh harris singlehandedly masterminded turning jimmy butler into josh richardson."
Imagine if they picked up Jahlil Okafor too.  Real scary hours
"As someone who has watched most kings games over the past five years, I can say definitively that Alex Len, Tristan Thompson, and Mo Harkless are better basketball players right now than Marvin Bagley will ever be. He is in his fourth year in the league and has shown zero improvement or desire to help the team. He is objectively the worst defensive big man in the league and he is a black hole on offense who cannot score effectively. He is like if Jahlil Okafor had no post game. He is that bad. Anyone who thinks he can contribute at all to winning at the NBA level either has not watched him play or is delusional."
"Jahlil Okafor is more talented than Marvin, period. Marvin is faster, more athletic, but Jah is a much more skilled big man."
"""Drafted well"" or have been drafting at the top of the lottery for quite a bit? I think they'd be looked at as more successful talent evaluators if they took Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown instead of Lonzo/Ingram. Caruso was undrafted.  I'll give some credit to the later rounders (add Kuz, THT, Zubac) but Randle, D-Lo, Lonzo, Ingram, etc. were good picks but had much higher expectations given where they were taken and overshadowed by the success of players taken a little after them like Lavine, Booker, Brown, Tatum... But at least they didn't go Jahlil Okafor or trade into the #1 spot to take Fultz."
"He was so talented and athletic around the rim coming out of college, like this isn’t jahlil okafor we’re taking about. he’s not some guy with cement feet."
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He’s no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I’m being petty but I’ve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I’m a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
Let’s ask Jahlil okafor how great that worked for his development. Ask Nerlens Noel also.  Michael carter Williams developed great playing unlimited minutes on trash teams with no direction.  The rockets are bad but giving these guys structure now benefits them more than bad minutes. Guys can develop in practice too.   Alperen has a fouling problem he’s had since the Turkish league. It’s better to fix that problem now rather than hoping he figures it out later considering he couldn’t just figure it out in the Turkish league either he averaged 28 mpg there.
Jahlil Okafor.
Bagley is pretty much Jahlil Okafor 2.0.  Type of player that will work well on college basketball but not on pro.
'16 Jahlil Okafor says hello
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
Ask Jahlil Okafor how much he developed losing non stop.
"eg was a reddit user who hyped Jokic up massively during his rookie season, saying things like ""would you rather have Jokic or Jahlil Okafor"", which was crazy at the time. Obviously with time, he was proven right, but a lot of people hated eg for being obsessed with - at that time - a relatively minor 2nd round rookie and he ended up getting banned from this subreddit  More recently, eg has been big on Hartenstein."
"As opposed to now, where a team could have had a top 5 pick five years straight and ended up with Markelle Fultz, Dragan Bender, Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker and Anthony Bennett.  Also assuming of course that in your world absolutely no good prospects ever go to college and national rankings are gospel with no chance of things like workouts and interviews impacting draft order at all.  We already did this for years. There weren’t any more busts 20 years ago than there are now."
"Evan Turner, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Michael Carter Williams. Philly has a horrendous record of first round picks"
"Man if they had packaged Lonzo Okafor for Gordon Hayward traded David Griffin and cash considerations to Phoenix for James Jones, trade Ingram for Zach Levine, traded Jahlil Okafor for a personal trainer and weight watchers unlimited plan for Zion, sign 3 solid bench players and the Pelicans could have won 2 championships and would have been set for Lebron to join them in a few years. It's crazy how GM's can't think two steps ahead these days"
"Search ""jahlil okafor vs nikola jokic nba reddit"" lmao"
"That’s just not true. There are mistakes routinely made in college games that you would never see the floor if you made those mistakes in NBA games.  See Jahlil Okafor.  It’s just college players aren’t good enough to take advantage of those mistakes, so you can look better defensively if the players you play against aren’t as good"
"For real tho. Weaver’s acquired Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Trey Lyles, now Bagley - give me ALL the busts"
"Why am I ""expected to provide a non analytics argument"" but you're not expected to provide an analytics argument for your eye test observations. We've already established the eye test is no more reliable and likely less reliable than analytics, see Jokic vs Jahlil Okafor 2015."
I lost faith in anyone's eye test a long long time ago when all the eye testers were saying Jahlil Okafor would be way better than Jokic.
"Who are you to say you know the *true* value of NBA players and decide what counts as an outlier? For all you know, they could be right. It's not like points/rebounds/assists is a good measure of value. It's not like the human eye can track every single thing that happens on the court. I'm sure you thought Jokic was an outlier when they said after Jokic's rookie year that he'd be way way better than Jahlil Okafor.   In terms of predictive accuracy, the only objective way to analyze models, RAPTOR is decent and there isn't really anything publicly available that can beat it."

Seeing Jahlil Okafor just sittin there on the 6ers bench is like havin a Harley in ur garage just collecting dust...Wat a Waste...This Yung fella can PLAY...Cmon sumbody...TRADE for him...Geez
Jahlil Okafor (Free Jah!!)
All 20+  Furkan Korkmaz  Landry Shamet  Matisse Thybulle  Tyrese Maxey  Top 3  Jahlil Okafor  Markelle Fultz  😫
"The question is always do you drop the player as is in that era or do they get an adjustment period? Or maybe if they were the same person who grows up in that era... There are many players who were able to change they style or shot selection to fit into new playing styles. Also I think many tend to assume certain aspects of an era. Like the claim Jahlil Okafor would have feasted in the 90s... No he wouldn't. That dude is 6'9 on a good day with slow feet. If you couldn't anchor the paint as a center in the 90s you got very little playing time, and centers were massive and strong."
Which Okafor? I'm assuming you mean Jahlil since Emeka's era was the mid-late 2000s?
Jahlil Okafor averaged 18ppg his rookie year……
"The same guy who picked Nerlins Noel, Joel Embiid and Jahlil Okafor in consecutive drafts LOL?  As if he wouldn't have taken Simmons.  His strategy was known to be BPA.  No shot he takes Jaylen Brown first that draft, it's laughable to even consider.  That 2019 team is exactly the type of team that Hinkie would have assembled.  His theory was always get a cornerstone piece or two and then consolidate everything else into a third star and backfill from there.  Simmons, Redick, Butler, Harris, Embiid is exactly that vision carried out."
so was jahlil okafor
"Knowing Hinkie, he would keep drafting big guys for no reason and the Sixers would be in an even worse place than they are now. I hate the way that people act like Hinkie was genuinely good at his job, he was mediocre at best. You literally named Jahlil Okafor as if he was a good asset, and Saric, McConnell, and Noel are mediocre players at best."
"Yep, Rose still has “enough” athleticism to create offense for himself and others. The days of a quick crossover into a 43” vertical dunking on 7 footers is gone but he can still create space for jumpers, get into the lane consistently, and added a variety of floaters/sneaky layups to replace his high flying ability to finish at the rim.  DMC is legitimately glued to the ground. He can’t elevate at all to finish consistently against defenses 1on1 or on lobs/dump off passes, has no lateral quickness to defend P&amp;R, and isn’t a shot blocker/alterer at the rim. He’s basically an inefficient lumbering  iso scoring big man that can’t do much else. Basically his injuries have morphed him into Jahlil Okafor."
I’m not making fun of the question I’m making fun of the “I don’t watch him play but his box scores look good”. That’s a decent chunk of this sub — not watching the game and forming opinions based on box scores.   This sub would have had a hard on for the Jahlil Okafor led Sixers even though it was the definition of empty stats.
Jahlil okafor honestly looks great compared to the doughy guy that came into the league
"Hinkie has a really clear ethos with the draft: Consensus highest upside.  Sometimes it pans out (Embiid), and other times it doesn't (Jahlil Okafor). Fultz was consensus highest upside from what I remember the narratives being at the time, and the Sixers were having a bit of a diminishing returns problem with draft picks, so he might've made the same move. Hard to say."
"I don't think anyone thinks that...for NBA standards, Bryant Reeves was below average athletically.  Do you consider Jahlil Okafor the be very athletic? For NBA standards he's average at best, and he is more athletic than Reeves was before his injuries."
Jerry's Kid Colangelo wasn't there to draft Jahlil Okafor. His mistake was in not trading the guy after his 17.5 and 7 rookie season when it was already clear Okafor couldn't pass out of the double team or defend and wasn't much of a rebounder. His stock only went downhill from there.
I'll give them the Jahlil Okafor in the streets every night if I have to
Still sad we barely got a taste of Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor together :(
"Well instead they drafted Michael Carter-Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, and Ben Simmons  and went 1-23 to start the season. Stop the “the process was shutdown” nonsense   The process was a clown show, and a failure"
"Yes, because that’s how normal people talk about basketball… with health in mind. Jahlil Okafor is better than Embiid in the post… when healthy…"
jahlil okafor
You're telling me Jahlil Okafor has a career resurgence
Teams scramble to give Jahlil Okafor a max contract.
JaMarcus Russell and Jahlil Okafor  Brady and Jordan
"even on there your ideas are dogshit, 2 karma points per post lmao, you woulda been a lot better off in like 1925-1942 that woulda been your peak bruh, just like Jahlil Okafor you are from the wrong era."
Jahlil Okafor 20-10. i mean it is out of joke but still..
Jahlil Okafor 20 and 10
"I wanna live in a timeline where Michael Beasley and Jahlil Okafor are mega stars. Back then, if i was a betting man, i’d buy up all their stocks"
"Jahlil Okafor for the 2016 #3 pick (that became Jaylen Brown) was a popular proposal right before the 2016 draft.  It was a reach even at the time, but I remember Sixers fans saying that wasn't enough for Jahlil."
"I think you can try and work with two players that are a bad fit, but never three. Like you'd never take Jahlil Okafor, Embiid and a point guard that can't shoot, for example."
Oh I agree completely agree that the front office plays a huge role.  I’m still pissed at Philly for ruining Jahlil okafor.  He may not be the best big man for today’s league but there’s no way you can tell me he wasn’t good enough for more minutes and patience then he got.  But Eddie was also lazy too.  I’m sure mental health played a role too but boy did he get fat over time
"&gt;That’s why we see situations every single year of players that play badly or play extremely well, and then do the opposite in the actual NBA. It does not matter.  That is something I am think is overstated. As shown by some of the stats I posted here, there is at least some correlation. For example Bam is a good all around center and he was good all around here. JV and DA are good at scoring and rebound and nothing else and that is how they were here. Jahlil Okafor is a high volume scorer who sucks at everything else and that is how he ended up as well. The only exception is Jokic but he is one of the biggest exceptions in NBA history developing into an MVP as a second round pick. People point to Kevin Knox as someone who was amazing in Summerleague but wasn't that good but actually he wasn't that good in Summerleague. Most of these people who do good are some veteran who is older and get on a little hot shooting streak. If Alperen had the just the most blocks or just the most rebounds I would think ""okay w/e small sample size."" But Alperen had amazing stats across the board from rebounding, assists, turnovers, steals, and blocks. There is a chance this guy can be really special and so far everyone he has played against, he has produced at an unprecedented level."
"Ya trash completely meaningless data. We see stuff like Jahlil Okafor passing like John Stockton, Andrea Bargnani rebounding like Ben Wallace. All flip of the coin data from summerleague."
"He put up just insane stats (on offense and defense) in the Summerleague. Arguably the best statistical stats for a center in summerleague ever. It is only summerleague but I could never see somebody like Enes Kanter, Jahlil Okafor, or Dragan Bender do that. Look up at the last post in my history if you want to see the comparison. It isn't just summerleague in isolation though. He did it in Europe too in a league where he has all ACC players coming off his bench meaning it is a fair bit better than College and he was the MVP in that league at 18 years old."
Like Jahlil Okafor.  He would’ve been a beast in these times maybe
Should have taken Jahlil Okafor y’all are a bit low on big men rn
"Michael Carter Williams, Bryant Reeves, Roy Hibbert, Jeremy Lin, Jahlil Okafor, Isaiah Thomas *to an extent* because the argument that his hip injury ruined his career is very valid but even then he hasn’t done much to prove himself  Brent Barry even though I wouldn’t necessarily say he was ever a *great* player, but that 01-02 campaign was pretty decent  John Salmons was pretty good for a bit  That’s about all I can think of"
Only if they add Jahlil Okafor to make it a true big 3.
&gt;Jahlil Okafor  What happened to him? I mean is he bad that no team wants him? Can you enlighten me coz i dont follow him much. Thanks
"Jahlil Okafor arrived in the NBA at the wrong time.  Twenty years ago, he would have had a better career. The evolution of the game has not benefited him considering his profile.  Why not try the Euroleague experience in Europe?"
"Jahlil ""I GOT MONEY"" Okafor lol"
"While I agree I do wonder if maybe there's a sense of necessity/urgency as far as getting *something* good/great back for him just because outside of Embiid nothing has worked out for the Sixers.  1st rd picks going back to 2014 when they drafted Embiid:  2014 - Embiid, Elfrid Payton.  Embiid obviously a centerpiece, but Payton was never all that special and still isn't today.  2015 - Jahlil Okafor -  Do I really need say anything?  Wasted 3rd pick.  2016 - Simmons, TLC, Korkmaz.  Simmons has been a disappointment, soon to be traded.  Wasted 1st pick possibly, depends on if they get extremely lucky with a trade. TLC is an ok bench player in limited stretches but nothing special, same for Korkmaz  2017 - Fultz - Had the yips, got traded, is halfway decent now.  Not great, not terribly special, but just ""ok"".  Wasted 1st pick.  2018 - Bridges and Shamet.  Bridges immediately traded for rights to Zhaire Smith (who has played like 13 games total in 2 yrs for Philly).  Shamet was solid, but he's gone too.  2019 - Ty Jerome whose rights were traded for Matisse ""Career avgs of 4.3/1.8/1.1"" Thybulle.    2020 - Tyrese Maxey.  Solid young player with lots of potential, but he's got a ways to go.  Oh and don't forget that after 2018/19 they lost Jimmy Butler.  I wouldn't be surprised if they feel like the last 7 years of moves has left them with nothing to show for it other than Embiid and now they feel pressure to get something ""good"" for Simmons, otherwise they just keep wasting FRP's for nothing.  I mean, this is the type of performance the avg GM would be on the hot seat for...a bunch of lottery picks that turned out to be one superstar who likely won't be dominant for long thanks to injury-history and a bunch of flameouts who ended up getting traded for Dorito-crumbs and bench players."
"I can't even tell if you're joking anymore. Nobody who answered that question in 2013 would randomly select 0 time all star, 0 achievements, role player Kyle Lowry as a guy who would be successful in the 90s. No one would pick a high school Jahlil Okafor in 2013 who at that point hasn't even proven he's successful in college, let alone the modern NBA, to be successful in the 90s NBA. It's ok to admit you are wrong. We're all wrong sometimes."
"You realize that since MJ said this in 2013, at a time when Kyle Lowry was not even an All  Star and Jahlil Okafor wasn't even in the league. I'm not saying MJ is right. I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to use these players as examples."
"Right, because everyone knew Jahlil Okafor in 2013. Or 0 time all star Kyle Lowry in 2013.   And it's not like he said Tim Duncan already or anything."
"I mean the Sixers/OKC strategy of tanking is a pretty recent phenomenon, but players like Jahlil Okafor or Andrew Wiggins never lived up to their immense hype, potentially because they played on bad teams.   But I don't really understand your point. Every draft like 70% of the lottery turns out to be average or disappointing for various different reasons. How am I supposed to name every player who became a bust because they were on trash teams when I don't know the specifics of each situation? I think its incumbent on YOU to provide a convincing list of recent, hyped players who emerged from tanking teams as number one guys."

Jahlil Okafor
That's pretty effing dumb. There's all kinds of players who would do great in MJ's era but they're not in MJ's era. Jahlil Okafor would have been an all star in the 90s. And as if Wade wouldn't have been trash. Tim Duncan? lol. Like KG would have been trash. I hate Paul Pierce but he'd have been great in the 90s. Kyle Lowry would have been an awesome guard in the 90s. It would have suited him. SMH.
He is a lot like Jahlil Okafor in that way.
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"&gt; Assuming we consider the top 5 a high pick, darko, Morrison, josh Jackson, Anthony Bennett dragon bender, kris dunn, jahlil okafor Mari hezonja etc were all far worse,  Yo he was a #1 pick, he was trash and in the level of all those other dudes you just mentioned. He was a big reason you guys sucked for a long time, theres a lot of draft busts that wander around the league for years because front offices want to take chances on them. Yall had one of the worst front offices that actually gave him contracts after that pick even."
"Nets Big Man Depth:  KD  Griffin  Claxton  Aldridge  Millsap  Bruce Brown (he’s used as a PG/C)  James Johnson  Sekou Doumbouya  De’Andre Bembry  Jahlil Okafor  Day’Ron Sharpe  That’s arguably 6 starting caliber bigs and 8 overall rotational bigs on the roster (Sekou, Bembry, Sharpe, and Okafor combine to be 1 rotational big). Sounds pretty good to me."
"One of the worst high picks of the last 20 years? I’m not even a fan of bargs but holy overstatement   Assuming we consider the top 5 a high pick, darko, Morrison, josh Jackson, Anthony Bennett dragon bender, kris dunn, jahlil okafor Mari hezonja etc were all far worse, bargs was a solid player for quite a few years, just not ever first overall pick good"
They’re certainly topheavy idk about the depth jahlil okafor brings
Casuals. We don't need Jahlil Okafor to get the #1 pick.
"Jahlil ""Taylor Hall"" Okafor"
Surprised they haven’t introduced the “Jahlil Okafor” clause to prevent creating a rift in spacetime for personal advantage
I can't be the only one who completely forgot jahlil okafor even exists. What happened to that guy?
How the hell is Jahlil Okafor only 25
I still feel like Jahlil Okafor can be a solid player for a team. He played really well for the Pels in place of AD for that stretch when AD sat out.
Jahlil Okafor is still in the NBA.
"Especially the team affiliation of DeAndre Jordan, Jahlil Okafor, and Sekou Doumbouya."
Since Jahlil Okafor plays centre he really should be called Jahlil Okafive.   I'm terribly sorry.
And **Jahlil Okafor**
"Hinkie drafted MCW, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor all high in the lottery.  Definitely some rose colored glasses when 76er fans talk about that man.  He wasn’t bad but he was definitely somewhere around average."
Yes the amazing Hinkie who drafted Jahlil Okafor
"Joel also turned it back on us, the fans. Danny Green did it too. Ben's asking to leave, the team's not forcing him. Is he not a diva and are we just the baddies???? Markelle dying, Colangelo's burners, Jahlil Okafor existing, Zhaire literally almost dying- has it been our fault all along"
&gt; He was enamored with Ingram iirc but the FO was starting to pull the leash He wanted KP too over JAH but wasn’t allowed to draft KP      This shit is just too hilarious. Apparently Hinkie never ever made a bad pick and the times that he did it was because he was forced into it. You think this sounds like someone who didn’t really want Okafor?    https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-sixers/sam-hinkie-takes-generational-talent-jahlil-okafor-over-need
"The process was Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz. Confirmed failure."

"It's really kind of unbelievable that Shawn Bradley, Keith Van Horn, Evan Turner, Jahlil Okafor, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz were all top 3 draft picks by Philadelphia."
"Wrong year homie, this was the year they drafted Jahlil Okafor (big oof), not Joel Embiid. The already knew Embiid was out well in advance. Even with Saric they knew he wouldn't report for a while (not to mention that he drafted Saric over Lavine and Warren). Those are really poor excuses, Hinkie had so many chances to improve the team and instead he kept making bad draft choices and refusing to sign FAs."
Jahlil okafor
"&gt; this is like when the process 76ers traded for nerlens noel, the next year they drafted embiid and then decided to draft jahlil okafor the next season.  Not really. Because of the simply fact they gave up assets and paid Lauri $16.7M or $21M annually just to develop him. Lauri is not better than Nance Jr. And Mobley has a better ceiling than Lauri.   This deal is really a head scratcher for me."
"wait so let me get this right  they went into the offseason planning to re-sign jarret allen, okay reasonable. then they drafted evan mobley, the fits a little weird but its still reasonable. now they sign markannen for starter money, what the fuck now lmao.  this is like when the process 76ers traded for nerlens noel, the next year they drafted embiid and then decided to draft jahlil okafor the next season."
"Former/ Current: Jahlil Okafor, Vuvevic, and Hakeem Olajuwon"

"Michael Beasley, Jahlil Okafor, OJ Mayo, Tyreke Evans, Derrick Williams."
Do you understand how stupid it sounds when you say taking Booker at age 18 over a guy who some saw as the top prospect Jahlil Okafor #3???
"my guy you missed so many things....  MCW traded after he was put on the season ticket renewal package... (internal turmoil)  that One time Jahlil Okafor got into a fight in Boston.  Elton Brand signed to babysit him... and eventually become GM!  the 2014-15-15-16 rotation of starting PGs on 10 day contracts  that time we ""didn't really"" but thought LeBron was gonna come"
This is the same dude that said the Lakers passed on the next Tim Duncan by not drafting Jahlil Okafor
Jahlil Okafor
Jahlil Okafor made All Rookie first team too
"Woof Blake Griffin really fell off a cliff. Also big lol at jahlil okafor even at the time what dingus saw that antiquated ass game and thought, yup future all-NBA guy right there"
Jahlil Okafor lmao
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
WIGGINS AT 2. ANDRE DRUMMOND IS IN THIS LIST. JAHLIL OKAFOR. **DRAGAN BENDER!!!**      This list is an EXPERIENCE
"Some interesting comments Bleacher Report added.  Andre Drummond (14th) - ""Drummond becomes a passable free-throw shooter and an effective low-post operator to complement his prodigious abilities as a rebounder and pick-and-roll finisher. His near-20-10 production and penchant for spectacular plays earn him All-Star and All-NBA status. His work as the leader of a basketball renaissance in Detroit, though, is what gets people whispering about Drummond for MVP.""  Andrew Wiggins (2nd) - ""Wiggins becomes the fifth unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year and the league's third in the last five campaigns. He follows that up by beginning an extended string of All-Star appearances while spearheading the rebirth of playoff basketball in Minnesota.""  Jahlil Okafor (18th) - ""Okafor, in turn, becomes an All-Star and a reliable 20-10 guy at center.""  Dragan Bender (19th) - ""Bender arrives stateside as a top-five pick in the 2016 NBA draft and develops, in time, into the NBA's next great European import.""  To be fair they predicted a Westbrook MVP, Giannis to develop into what he is today, and Curry to get an MVP and title."
"Jahlil Okafor is still in the league? Damn I forgot entirely about him.  I know busts happen all the time, but how can someone who was drafted so high not even be a rotation player."
Michael Carter Williams Jr and Jahlil Okafor Jr will be studs I’m telling you
I saw Jah and was like “wtf Jahlil Okafor??” then realized you meant Ja Morant
"MCW, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Fultz   Draft picks are hard to gauge. Worst thing the Sixers did during the process was give up Picks for Tobias and then give him a max, and then lose Jimmy.  Edit: Also the Mikal Bridges trade. Some questionable decisions from the FO but overall they’ve still done pretty good."
Psh he should grow some stones like Jahlil Okafor and fight the fans himself
"I really hate it when people bring up some scrub big man right now and tell me he would be great in the 90s because he has some post moves. Like the 10 years where the majority of the best players were Cs or PFs? Who could play offense and defense? Andre Drummond wouldn't dominate, Jahlil Okafor would be absolute trash. I understand the game is really different but the truth is we just haven't had big man talent quite like Hakeen, Ewing, Robinson, Duncan, Shaq, Mourning, Malone, Webber, Barkley (if he counts as big) just to name a few off the top of my head. They could possibly be like Jerami Grant types where they score 20 and the team is absolute ass but other than that they wouldn't be good either. I'm glad Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert and making big men more relevant again. They all play differently too which is fun to watch and talk about"
Anywhere from Jahlil okafor to Andre Drummond
where does it rank on the spectrum of Markelle Fultz to trading the rights to Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith?  Somewhere around a Jahlil Okafor?
"So the only thing separating Shaq and Jahlil Okafor is that Shaq is 100 pounds bigger? And that somehow makes what Shaq did, not impressive?   This is a stupid ass argument that quickly falls apart when you think about it for longer than a second."
Jahlil Okafor would be a starter
"oh, the discounts weren't just in philly. I got courtside seats for only 100 bucks in DC, and i got to watch john wall make gravy out of nerlens noel and jahlil okafor. it was awesome.  same against LAC at staples, I saw De'Andre Jordan dunk SEVEN times on those poor babies, and tickets were dirt cheap compared to everything else at Staples."
"Oh yeah, teach me how not to draft someone like Markelle Fultz or Jahlil Okafor."
"Imo yeah. If kawhi &amp; PG, lebron &amp; AD, steph &amp; klay, and Jerami grant &amp; jahlil Okafor can team up then Kyrie and KD is fair game."
Kristaps is a walmart jahlil okafor who thinks hes steph curry
true empty stats guys like Jahlil Okafor are very rare
"Starters: Brandon Jennings, Josh Richardson, Kyle Kuzma, Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond  Bench: Derrick Caracter, Anthony Randolph, Marcus Banks, Jon Brockman  Coach: Paul Silas"
"""Jabari Parker""  ""Justise Winslow""  ""Jahlil Okafor""  oh man"
At least you didn’t draft Jahlil Okafor over him. Thank god we at least were smart enough to draft Mikal Bridges a few years later.
Apparently you missed the two games that Jahlil Okafor started for the Pistons this season.
Yeah because you commenting dumb shit that isn’t even about anything really adds to a conversation. Kinda cool to see a player we’ve been saying was good as fuck since people thought he was worse than Jahlil Okafor actually become an all-time great trajectory and near-unanimous or unanimous MVP. Definitely hype and nice to see the illiterate takes people have been making about him for years become a smaller and smaller minority

"What about if he was in a starting 5 with Jarrett Culver, Keljin Blevins, Thon Maker, and Jahlil Okafor?"
Jahlil Okafor? Edit: How about Shump?
"It’s not tho. Porzingis was the best option the Knicks honestly could’ve gotten at the 4th pick. The picks after Porzingis were, in order, Mario hezonja, willie cauley stein, Emmanuel mudiay, Stanley johnson, frank kaminsky, and Justise Winslow. Porzingis, despite his problems, is still a significantly better player than all of those players. For it to be a cautionary tale, it has to be a bad pick or something the team regrets. I guarantee you the Knicks do not regret drafting Porzingis over someone like Emmanuel mudiay. Honestly this draft actually disproves your point. Jahlil okafor is the typical “big man” with typical “big man skills” contrary to Porzingis. However, jahlil okafor turned out to be way worse than Porzingis. A better point would honestly be that it’s a cautionary tale to not take typical big man over unicorn big men"
Not even Jahlil Okafor could lead this Knicks team
"Hot take, but he might even be better than Jahlil Okafor"
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
They did have franchise cornerstone Jahlil Okafor 👀
"As someone who has met Jahlil Okafor, that dude doesn’t have a pulse in general. He’s like the Nihilists from the Big Lebowski. He literally doesn’t care about anything. It would take a lot to piss him off."
Bro it’s Jahlil Okafor. The dude has gotten in trouble for a lot of dumb things.
Jahlil Okafor disagrees. The only time he showed any kind of fight in his career was due fo some good ol’ Boston racism.
Jahlil Okafor Jr is hyped that his team is down 8
"&gt;	The negative reaction from Knicks fans at Barclays Center had to do in part with their lack of familiarity with Porzingis, who played in Spain. After the Timberwolves did as expected and selected Kentucky big man Karl-Anthony Towns with the first overall pick, the Lakers took Ohio State guard D’Angelo Russell before the Sixers snagged Duke forward Jahlil Okafor.  &gt;Watching Okafor taken with the third choice irritated Knicks fans. The selection of Porzingis felt like pouring salt in the wounds, especially with Duke forward Justise Winslow and guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who played in China last season, still available.  https://nypost.com/2015/06/25/why-knicks-fans-at-draft-were-so-upset-with-porzingis-pick/"
Damn when bam gotta play against somebody just as tall and fast as him he looks like Jahlil Okafor
“Watch the games more and look at numbers less”. I watched the game. I watch every game. Beal got clamped by Ben and Matisse and hasn’t won in Philly since we debuted Jahlil Okafor in 2015. You’re such a casual you’re trying to argue that switching off a screen means you got scored on lmao.
"Top 3 picks can be very good, but they also bust more often then people realize. The Sixers got Simmons and Embiid, but they also drafted Evan Turner, Markelle Fultz and Jahlil Okafor with Top 3 picks."
"I think it is mostly on the player. It is super rare where a player busts on one team and then goes to another team who was able to unlock their hidden potential that the previous team wasn't able. Many of these draft busts are let go even when they are in their early 20's or even like 21 years old so they have plenty of time to develop with other teams. Dragan Bender, Josh Jackson, Derrick Williams, Anthony Bennett, Jahlil Okafor, etc these guys were all young when they switched teams and the new team wasn't able to get much more of them. The fact that is just so rare that this happens and the best examples people can come up with are Josh Jackson putting up slightly better numbers than his rookie year and unable to start on the worst team in the east, or Wiggins shooting better when he is with the insane gravity of Curry. It is so rare infact, I can't even think of a single example where a player is determined to be a bust, switches team, then lives up anywhere close to their predraft hype. Only example that kind of fits is Tobias Harris, and he was a middle of the first round draft pick and just got more minutes on a new team."
"I didn’t like him much as a player before his injuries. He was cut from the same cloth as Jahlil Okafor, just better at it. His play style was endangered when he was coming in and he was going to become obsolete no matter what."
&gt; smart drafting  2013 - Michael Carter-Williams (11)  2014 - Elfrid Payton (10)  2015 - Jahlil Okafor (3)  2017 - Markelle Fultz (1)  Go on...
Jahlil Okafor
"Free agency makes this stat not the most useful.  When a player leaves to another team for free agency, draft order ceases to have any meaning.  For example, Detroit is the most underperforming team according to this post.  Consider Jahlil Okafor who was drafted #3 by the Sixers but plays for the Pistons now.  It's safe to say that he didn't pan out as hoped.  Detroit didn't draft him and he's now playing for the league minimum.  This stat punishes teams for signing free agents who didn't live up to draft expectations but are now playing decently for another team considering their current contracts."
"Some of the moves they got tons of shit for at the time look great in retrospect, like trading Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Willams while they were still positive assets. Hell, they got flak for ""drafting an injured player"" in Joel Embiid."
"People had to know that eventually this dude was going to come around and be a pretty damn good basketball player. Being so highly recruited and such a high pick and with so much pressure on him to play well may have gotten to him a little but being on a team where the pressure is off of him and steph and draymond handle it he seems to be playing more free and relaxed. This dude is a great ball player and I think now that he's come around and his confidence is up that he'll consistently produce numbers like he is for years to come.  On another note, this has nothing to do with this post, I would also like to say if Tristan Thompson can be playing Center for the Celtics why has no one really given Jahlil Okafor a true shot at Center. I know he's not a high flyer and he's not an exciting player but I think in his rookie season he averaged like 17ppg or something like that. Someone could've molded that guy to be a productive player and maybe even a really good center, he has great scoring ability around the basket and I know this bcuz I'm a die hard Pelicans fan and he impressed me with his play when he got a lot of mins. C'mon NBA GMs give that man a serious chance, he was great at Duke and I think the Celtics could even use a guy like that who can score around the rim and rebound and win 1 on 1 battles down low when they send double teams to tatum or brown. All I'm saying is there's got to be room for a guy with that kind of low post scoring talent to get 20+ mins a game somewhere. Just an example look at Fultz in Orlando, he's completely redefined himself and has really turned into more of the player that everyone expected to be a top pick."
"When's the last time a top 10 RPM on high total minutes was a total fluke?  I remember when people use to say ""don't listen to RPM, Jahlil Okafor is better than Nikola Jokic"".   Likewise people distrusted FVV's RPM. But he's a clear star as well.  Even Middleton had an elite RPM as a totally unknown player. Looked like a fluke, but in hindsight clearly he had elite impact."
"not in NBA history, but Jahlil Okafor literraly only has a back-to-the-basket post up game, and doesn't contribute to winning in any other ways."
"lol yeah most of bigs pick 2nd ending up bust. bagley(still has chance), jahlil okafor, jabari parker,derick williams, hasheem tabeet, darko milicic name a few."
"I needed the Heat to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Pistons. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close.  Fuck Bey and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first.  Fuck the Pistons. Fuck Troy Weaver. It's not adorable to be utter shit for one year by choice. It's pathetic.  Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games.  Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Jahlil ""I punched a boston fan in the face"" Okafor. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional.  But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""Beywatch"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Jerami Grant is Jerian Grant 2.0 and Okafor is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot.  Fuck the Pistons, Fuck Okafor, Troy Weaver, Fuck the Pistons. Also FTP.  EDIT: LOL I see a lot of Pistons fans coming over here acting like fucking childs. Let me just say this:  I have more respect for the 2008 Detroit Lions than for the 2020/21 Pistons the Lions at least tried to win a game."
Jahlil Okafor drops 50 and the Pistons win easily
"that doesnt excuse trading for nerlens noel, who can only play center, drafting embiid (whos really really goos, but again can only play center) and jahlil okafor, who can again only play center."
Jahlil okafor would've been so good if he wasn't so bad
Jahlil okafor would’ve been so good if he wasn’t born in this era
"If they never hit on Tyreke, Boogie, and IT in that two-year span, they probably would have hard tanked in the early 2010's and probably been a much better team in the late 2010's. Though knowing their draft history, they'd probably have taken like Anthony Bennett, Jabari Parker, Jahlil Okafor, and Dragan Bender instead of getting actual good players like KAT/Embiid/BI/Jaylen Brown."
What happened to Jahlil Okafor after his rookie season? I wasn’t paying attention to other teams at that time.
Jahlil Okafor finished 2nd in NPOY voting as a freshmen. Can't believe he flamed out this badly
I'd pick Darko over Jahlil Okafor anyday.
I remember a lot of drama in the Jahlil Okafor saga. #freejah. I think they did and he never preformed. Poor guy.
2010 Wesley Johnson  2011 Derrick Williams  2012 Thomas Robinson  2013 Anthony Bennett (duh)  2014 Jabari Parker  2015 Jahlil Okafor  2016 Dragan Bender  2017 Markelle Fultz  2018 Marvin Bagley  2019 Jarrett Culver
Pg: Evan Turner   SG: tyreke Evans   SF: jabari parker  Pf: MCW  C: Jahlil Okafor
"Evan Turner, Maurice Harkless, MCW, Elfrid Payton, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz  That one time they drafted Mikael Bridges but opted to trade him for Zhaire Smith.. idk how much of who overruling who at that time but the scoutings were def into Zhaire Smith enough to convince acting GM Brett Brown to pull that trade"
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"
"I still think there's a chance he's on this roster next year. It's far more likely that Jahlil Okafor is dumped or cut. Literally the only he has going for him is we need a third big and that's his place by default for the time being. Once the Pistons go to training camp and if he can't clearly outplay Garza, he'll be gone. It's funny that having a glut of quality wings was the exact opposite problem that the Pistons usually have had over the past decade."
Oh shit. Well we do E'twaun Moore or Jahlil Okafor
Jahlil Okafor.
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
"Yea, totally forgot he finished All Rookie First Team. Just looked up that year’s Rookie First Team, and it’s legit - Booker, KAT, Porzingis, Jokic and… of all people, Jahlil Okafor.   Man, Okafor’s another example of a career that could have been so different had he not landed on a team that got Embiid."
Jahlil Okafor would  tell u otherwise
Evan turner   Tyreke evans   Jabari Parker   Jahlil okafor   Nerlens noel
"maybe Hinkie should've drafted Porzingis instead of Jahlil Okafor then we could've seen Embiid, Porzingis, and Simmons together"
"I feel like this could have different brackets.  Self destruction: OJ mayo, Lamar Odom. Injuries. D-Rose, Jabari Parker, Andrew Bynum Good player but still kind of qualifies: John Wall, Cousins, Porzingis Guys who were legit top 5 but got old. Melo, Dwight, Marc Gasol Guys who plateaued early: Trevor Ariza, Al Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Malcolm Brogdan."
"Yeah, if we look at it like who would be but for the injuries it's basically Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, Derrick Rose. But I agree, we should look at it as whose skills just weren't as dominant or who couldn't develop enough. Jahlil Okafor would be a recent pick for me. And Deron Williams a decade or so ago had an absolutely baffling dropoff."
"Frank Kaminsky would also go to your college and completely destroy them. Grant Williams had 300 ways of scoring in the paint in college. Olynyk, Willie Cauley-Stein, Jahlil Okafor, Marvin Bagley…  The college frontcourt just doesn’t project well into the NBA.   It’s better for guys like Olynyk who don’t get drafted with late-playoff starter expectations (the Hornets took 22 year old Kaminsky in the high lottery, which looked pretty similar at the time to how it looks now), because a lot of the players I just named actually can compete as 8th man high-scoring centers, but just aren’t athletic enough for NBA rim protection. Garza can be something good, but it’s not because he’s an excellent college player, all the excellent 22 year old college bigs that find a role in the NBA have to change a lot and rise to the challenge of low-volume efficiency."
Jahlil Okafor
"Literally every sixers first round pick during “The Process”: Jahlil Okafor, Michael carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Markell Fultz. Ben Simmons lol."
"Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Adam Morrison, Emmanuel Mudiay, Jahlil Okafor, and more lol. There’s a lot of these guys 😭"
Jahlil Okafor
also Jahlil Okafor.
Jahlil Okafor
Ayyyyyy my team went undefeated my senior year just to get massacred by Jahlil Okafor 💪🏽
#JAHLIL OKAFOR (for the pelicans)
"Historically? Jahlil Okafor is a lock for the #1 pick, thus making him the GOAT tank commander."
Jahlil Okafor is an all-timer
"Bluntly, would the Warriors have given him a max contract ?  Being part of The Process earned him around $200 million dollars, because after their several failed picks  - Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor - Philly were desperate enough to lock down one of their semi-successes to a long term deal."
I agree. Lakers should acquire Jahlil Okafor right now because history shows that having a post up center is the best way to win.
"1.) not everyone who wins a ring is an elite defender 2.) Melo understands defensive concepts more than you ever will to actually play at an NBA level for 18 years.  Actual bad defenders who can’t guard anyone don’t play, check out Jahlil Okafor.  Being elite and being terrible are two different things  3.) you cannot tell a person what drives them.  Why at 36 is he up at 5 am training everyday when other people his age are retired and just enjoying life.  That’s his motivation to keep working.  Whether you think he’s good enough doesn’t negate what his motivation.  You know there’s people who work everyday and never accomplish being elite at whatever they do in their life.  It doesn’t mean their goal isn’t to get more.   Developing elite defense doesn’t just happen for everyone. You realize you can work at something and not get better. Take Dwight and freethrows, it’s reported he works hours a day shooting freethrows and hits in the high 80% in practice and just doesn’t make them in game. Not being able to do something in the NBA is never as simple as not trying.  Take it from someone’s played high level basketball and I’m still around college and pros who work hard everyday.   There’s a college center who never made the league and had the worst freethrow percentage in his conference that I trained with last year who literally wouldn’t miss a shot in workouts, the next level is the next level for a reason, it’s not as simple as not trying."
jahlil okafor
"There's a video on YouTube called ""Jahlil Okafor - postup powerhouse"" and it shows how skilled he is. I still go back to that every now and then."
"I don't think Jahlil Okafor belongs there. He's clearly a tier above all of them.   On a serious note, his post game/scoring game is very nice to watch. He has a good face up game and back to basket game. It's sad to see that he hasn't adapted. I was very high on him."
Kyrie Irving.   Trae Young. (minus foul baiting).   Jahlil Okafor.    Paul George.
Next item on the agenda: turn Jahlil Okafor into Wilt Chamblerain
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
Don't forget Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor
"Nobody, gotta save Wyc's wallet.   I would like Danny Green for the MLE (not gonna happen)  I also wouldn't mind taking a flyer on Winslow for the minimum, we can add him to our Duke collection with Tatum and Jabari.   And fuck it, since we are clearly punting the season and not trying that hard to win, bring in another Dukie in Jahlil Okafor just to keep Tatum happy. He can make garbage time entertaining."
"I had Luka 1, Ayton 2 and Trae 3.   That was one of my best picked top 3s in ages.  But on the flipside, I also liked Jahlil Okafor a lot, so..."
Not only that they had Christian Wood on their team before he got paid and let him go so they could keep Jahlil Okafor. There’s so many little moves that were obvious at the time they were mistakes. Like extending Adams at 17 million before he played a game there. There’s no way he gets that contract or this summer if he was a FA.
"You think that's bad, let me tell you about Jahlil Okafor and Markelle Fultz.."
"The Pistons currently have 6 ACC players: Wayne Ellington, Jerami Grant, Frank Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, and Dennis Smith"
"Lol definitely not the worst. Amir Johnson, Jahlil Okafor, Jonah Bolden, Kyle O'Quinn, Greg Monroe..."
"According to this article: - Dame - Kyrie - CP3 - Javale McGee - DeAndre Jordan - Jahlil Okafor - Wilson Chandler  https://veganliftz.com/vegan-basketball-players/  Lewis Hamilton, the Williams twins and a number of MMA guys as well."
"Between Griffin's dead money opening up and the contracts for Josh Jackson and Jahlil Okafor ending, you still got $35 mil opening up next year. And even if we add a $20 mil player this year and re-sign guys like Frank Jackson and Saban Lee, we would still have $50+ mil left under the luxury tax next year. There's room to make moves with Grant being the highest paid at $20 mil and a whole lot of young players on cheap contracts. If the contracts signed this year become some kind of hindrance there's always ways around it, be it sign and trade or dumping salary like we just did with Plumlee. If a player wants to come, you can make it work. I'm just not a fan of sitting on this ability to make yourself better when you don't know what happens next year. For all you know Beal or whoever could sign an extension and you miss out both this year and next year."
Because we have an undersized sophomore and Jahlil Okafor as his backup.  Team can’t get better if it’s missing players that can help. And we got cap to get said help
"They have 1 undersized center, a rookie 2nd rounder, and Jahlil Okafor on the roster so I don’t think that’s too accurate"
"Can we name a few? Not challenging you or saying you’re wrong, but not many really come to mind for me for picks that high.  On the other hand you’ve got people like Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Harry Giles, WCS, Mo Bamba, Cody Zeller, etc, all off the top of my head who never really panned out. Feel like there’s tons in the opposite direction."
the *roll out of bed Jahlil Okafor* I see
"If they didn’t care they wouldn’t be playing, nobody’s looking at that team going “Yeah Jahlil Okafor and Jordan Nwora are gonna carry us to glory”."
What need would Sengun have filled? A small Jahlil Okafor role?
"Vin Baker comes to mind as someone who's career went way down post-lockout while battling alcoholism.  Recent example would be someone like Jahlil Okafor, who as a top 5 pick had a solid start to his career before strategies changed so fast and he was left behind."
"&gt; He would have had more home runs like Jahlil Okafor  He wanted Porzingis, but was overruled.   &gt;Michael Carter-Williams  he won rookie of the year, at one point he was looked at as a good pick."
"He would have had more home runs like Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Williams? The Jrue Holiday - Nerlens Noel trade?   I'm not saying it can't succeed, but I'm saying it's the easy part of a GM's job, to sell everybody, to take in bad contracts.  And it's a way to sell hope to your fans."
Jahlil Okafor was the final sign the NBA needed to stop drafting those guys with a valuable pick
Jahlil Okafor and Cade the dream team
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
You think his career is unsave-able? Like PF Jahlil Okafor
"Our offer is 4 top 50 protected picks, 2022, 2024, and 2026 2nd round pick swaps, and Josh Jackson or Jahlil Okafor"
IMO that's a very generous interpretation of a bust. Jahlil Okafor got a second and third contract.
I don't get it either. Almost all of the scouting videos I've seen he looks like the white Jahlil Okafor.
He lost all credibility with me when he had Jahlil Okafor number one ahead of KAT.
#1994 LEGEND JAHLIL OKAFOR IS NOT A MAN TO BE MESSED WITH
Nice theory but you’re ignoring the possibility of Jahlil Okafor ascending to godhood and leading the Pistons to the championship averaging 35 and 15 a game.
We’re wondering if he’s better than Jahlil Okafor
"I mean what else were they gonna do? Draft Jahlil Okafor?  Same with the Edwards pick, they already had D'Angelo Russell, they were not gonna take Lamelo Ball.  Josh Okogie was a decent find at 20th though"
Pretty amazing how Jahlil Okafor went from the number 3 pick in the NBA draft to getting the 10th most minutes on Nigeria's Olympic team
"If you like big man post moves, 2015 Jahlil Okafor has some pretty lit one. Drop steps, shimmy fade, dream shakes, man have it all. Too bad he didn't turn out to be a better athletes."
Nigeria has a player named Jahlil Okafor lmao. Looks he didnt roll out of bed today
"Right? Like when I see OJ Mayo from multiple people...  Most players are out in the league for their first contract, someone is not a bust for just not making an All Star.  Is Nerlens Noel a bust? He has put together a solid role but it took awhile  Howabout someone like Jahlil Okafor, who is pretty typical of a lot of of the people we see on this list, offensive topside but inability to adjust to the higher level game defensively."
2 2nds this year plus Josh Jackson or they can have olympic hero Jahlil Okafor
"I mean, if Team USA extended an invite I'm sure Jahlil Okafor would play for them instead.  Some hoopers are just looking for more basketball to play lol"
"He is not nearly the playmaker, rebounder, or offensively talented as Sabonis. Comparing him to a guy who averaged a triple double in the final month of the regular season and 20/12/7 on the year should be criminal. Personally, I see a slightly more athletic Jahlil Okafor"
"What was that one comment from like 5 yrs ago ""If you are picking Jokic over Jahlil Okafor to build around should be checked into a mental institution"" or something. Oh [here we go](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/42u6qz/jokic_or_okafor_who_would_you_rather_have_for_the/czd4uln?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
He’s basically Jahlil Okafor 2.0
"I tend to agree with the people sh1tting on this post. Teams trade up or down for multiple reasons and that is they're trying to get the best player possible.  With Mikal Bridges and Zhaire Smith,  did any one look at the pre draft analysis? Imo, the 76ers did draft the best player available at a lower slot and received some reward. They traded up for the best player player available overall in Fultz. That development goes differently has nothing to do with draft night selections .   Jason Tatum could have blown out both knees like Jabari,  Jahlil  Okafor could have developed similarly to Embid . The best player drafted is only truly known years later not at the time of draft"
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
I thought Jahlil Okafor would be better than KAT lol
I thought Wiggins and Jabari were gonna be the next great rivalry.   I thought Jahlil Okafor was gonna be the next great center.
Here's the list from last season.  DeMarcus Cousins  Andre Drummond  Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond  DeMarcus Cousins  Gorgui Dieng  Cristiano Felício    Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins  Dewayne Dedmon   Nikola Jokić  Kelly Olynyk  Bam Adebayo   Steven Adams  Khem Birch    Kelly Olynyk                                   Jeff Green            Bruno Fernando  Jahlil Okafor
I don’t think he was adverse to trading up. I seem to recall for example the Sixers kicked the tires on trading up from 3 to 2 in 2015 to take D’Angelo Russell over Jahlil Okafor. But you need a willing partner and the Lakers weren’t down.
2006 	1. Andrea Bargnani 3.adam morrison   2002:  2. jay willilams 3.mike Dunleavy jr   2000:  2. stromile swift  3. darius miles   2009: 2 hasheem thabeet   2010: 2. evan turner 3. Derrick favors   2011 2.derrick williams 3 enes kanter   2012:  2 micheal kidd   2015 3 jahlil okafor   based on what you said pick your superstar they're all top 3 picks
Nobody even mentions that disaster Jahlil Okafor.  All the shit the sixers went through and it's as if people forget Okafor got into fights and fired a gun.    Also trading Jrue for Noel is classic 6ers
"It was definitely more than just 3 years.    2013: Nerlens Noel - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2014: Joel Embiid - Injured, Missed first two seasons  2015: Jahlil Okafor - Not Injured, Mega bust  2016: Ben Simmons - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2017: Markelle Fultz - Injured, Missed 68 games in Rookie year  2018: Zhaire Smith - Injured/Near death allergic reaction, Missed 76 games in Rookie year and only played 13 total career games"
The Process edition:  Markelle Fultz  Michael Carter-Williams  Ben Simmons  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlen Noel
"Allen Iverson - an all time great but he's waaaay overhyped  Kyrie Irving - his fans talk about him like a top ten guard ever, he's really really not  Andrew Wiggins - was supposed to be the next Lebron, instead became Wigs   Ben Simmons - lol  Jahlil Okafor - LOL"
"lmfaooooo Jahlil Okafor is not more talented than Pat Bev. If you can't recognize that you genuinely have 0 ball knowledge. Also I wasn't comparing scrubs to Jokic. I compared Kemba to him, who in his prime was a great player. It probably was a bit flattering to him though, since Jokic is more on a Fred Van Vleet skill level."
&gt;right now  Your own words you can’t even name one currently.   Comparing Mike James to Steven Adams is nowhere near comparing them to Jokic lmao. You’re absolutely clueless. Jahlil Okafor is more talented than Pat Bev yet Pat Bevs in the league.
"Don't forget Okafor trying to throw hands outside of Boston https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2015/11/27/9806758/jahlil-okafor-street-fight-boston-76ers  Also gotta mention the game 3 confetti Canon, the Embiid-Rihanna saga, and Jimmy Butler."
Jahlil Okafor still exists
"The Colangelos, all of them, made a mess of that rebuild.  Hinkie got booted before he was finished the ""easy"" part.  Morey is trying to salvage the payoff part.  Jerry and Bryan Colangelo fucked this team.  We've got Bryan to thank for the following: Holding Nerlens Noel until there was nothing left of his trade value (Bogut, Justin Anderson and two 2nds), using a first on Timothe Luwawu Cabarot, signed fucking Jerryd Bayless and Gerald Henderson.  Traded the 3rd overall pick and our first in 2019 to our division rival to move up to first and take the kid that by all accounts the Celtics didn't want and the Lakers already seemingly in on Lonzo.  Traded Jahlil Okafor, *Sauce Castillo* and a second for... Trevor Booker?  Who was unceremoniously cut 2 months later. Granted Okafor had minimal value, but surely there was a better deal than Trevor Booker. Or we'd have been better off holding on to that 2nd rounder at least.  Fucking Burner Gate, the most ridiculous story to happent to the Sixers and surely the most ridiculous story that would ever happen to the Sixers for at least 2-3 years.  And then *THAT* led to the Elton Brand/Brett Brown brain trust which finished screwing the pooch on assets and cap space.  I was all about the process and still think it could have worked, but that's a tough fucking stump to pull."
Jahlil Okafor getting a 10 day contract just for Ben’s return
And why is Jokic ahead of Jahlil Okafor!?
All depends. I honestly think most people here have watched very little of DA and don't understand what he does for this team. Y'all are acting like he's Jahlil Okafor or 30+ year old DeAndre Jordan. He's not that type of center - an actually close comparison is Bam.
"At least Parker, Jahlil Okafor and Kyrie have that Duke education to fall back on"
For every Jahlil Okafor there's a Brandon Ingram so I'm with you. I usually try to avoid judging players before they're out of their rookie contracts.
"Best: I was completely confident that as a big man that wasn't a very good shooter, passer, or defender that Jahlil Okafor was not lottery talent in the modern NBA.    Worst: I really thought Dougie McBuckets was going to be an elite NBA scorer relatively early in his career"
"Misses: tatum, Fultz, dsj, jaylen, deandre hunter  Hits: luka, lavine, Jahlil okafor, Simmons"
The Okafor stuff was reported on at the time.  Example  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-sixers/report-jahlil-okafor-was-celtics-target-proposed-blockbuster
The other baskets also include Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor.  I know they don't get those high lottery if these 2 panned out but how do you draft top 6 five years in a row and get 1 franchise guy + whatever Ben is gonna do
"Lemme indulge this deranged ranting one more time...  &gt;Good on you for admitting you’re wrong. Hope you can learn from it by not using such aggressive and inflammatory language in the future.  Pot meet kettle.  &gt;Again, the reason I’m laughing about the proverbial pie on your face is because you have been so aggressive about shoving that same pie in everyone’s face if the conversation is even tangentially related to Jokic’s MVP. The irony is both palpable and amusing to me.  What 'pie' am I shoving? Are you specifically addressing the one specific point in my entire argument about Jokic here that I accepted was false, or my arguments about Jokic in general?  Because I'll stand by it again, no matter how mad it seems to make you; Jokic wouldn't have won MVP if the frontrunners didn't get injured for long periods of times when they did in this crazy, condensed COVID season.  &gt;Yes, I recognized your name because it’s hardly conspicuous and a unique user name + the same bad take across multiple threads on the same topic is pretty easy to remember (but RES tagging is also a thing, just fyi). Jokic hate really isn’t that rare on r/nba  When there are only a few commenters who ever remain objective in the face of the Jokic heterodoxy on r/nba, of course it'll look &amp; feel like it's Jokic 'hate.'  &gt;\- it wasn’t that long ago that EG was a pariah for daring to compare him to Jahlil okafor, let alone Noel, towns, embiid etc.  See, this is where you've seem to gone off the rails because I don't even know what all this is,  &gt;But there certainly are a lot of you “truthers” with a victim/persecution complex who seem to think you’re the only true visionaries who can see him for the fraud that he is.  Naw, he's not a 'fraud'. Great player. An MVP caliber player, obviously. My argument in this context was that he wouldn't have won MVP if not for the extremely beneficial &amp; essentially unprecedented circumstances of this season.  &gt;It used to be that it was “the eye test” that he failed, despite putting up highlights that routinely got him and the nuggets near the top of everyone entertainment/leaguepass darling list.  I don't think I mentioned anything about 'eye test' or whatever you're talking bout here; again, I think you're ranting &amp; arguing against the clouds here or something.  &gt;Then it was that he was too fat, despite clearly using his size and strength well.  Lmao, the dude has been pretty chubby, but when did I even make this argument?  &gt;Now he’s in significantly better shape. What is it now? Too european? Not a big enough social media presence?  Aaah, there it is. The subtle racial suggestions; Jokic stans heavily imply they &amp; their favorite player are oppressed more than Luka stans.  \#1 reason why I hated Jokic stans this past season? Because the whole 'NBA is riggin it against Jokic' conspiracy because, ""they don't wanna let the first humble European win MVP!!!"" shit was such a subtly racist, blatantly ridiculous circlejerk that had no evidence to it. Not just with the MVP race specifically even, but with the way he's covered in the media &amp; what not as well.  Plenty of threads at the time pushing this narrative that Jokic is somehow oppressed when the people making this exact argument (I even remember people saying what I put in quotes) don't realize how well loved Giannis is as the guy who just won 2x MVPs; almost like Giannis is seen as a different type of European.  Not saying you necessarily said this in those threads midseason, but assuming how ardent you are in some of your claims &amp; implications, I wouldn't be surprised.  &gt;Also not sure why you’re clinging to the “but muh seeding!” argument. The nuggets had basically the same record as the Sixers despite playing in the significantly harder conference.  Right, but the voters still vote for the 1 &amp; 2 seed regardless pretty much everytime except in the case of Westbrook's statistically unprecedented (at the time) MVP season &amp; narrative.  &gt;The nuggets are the only team in the west to be a top 3 seed each of the last 3 seasons. No other western team has done it twice in that span, let alone all 3 years. But please, tell me more about how Jokic is unable to carry his team to a top seed.  Again, never even said any of this. This is just, again, you getting irrationally mad at an invisible person &amp; argument you made up in your head my guy; you good?  You Nuggs fans have taken the #1 spot from Raps fans as the most perpetually oppressed small market fanbase with a huge victim complex.  Anyways, that's all I'm gonna say on this; you took the time to respond to me so I felt courteous and took the time to respond to this rant. Peace"

Jahlil Okafor has never missed the 1st pick
"A few. I wouldn't really call them ""meaningful"" but whatever. I've told these stories on here before but it's been a few years. I used to work at a restaurant at the Indianapolis City Market which is pretty close to Banker's Life Fieldhouse. Jahlil Okafor didn't say much but he did order four meals for himself. The man is a giant. I had to stop him from accidentally grabbing someone else's order too.   Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin got food when they were coaches at St. Johns. A lot of people were recognizing Mullin and going up to him and stuff and he looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Mitch came to get the food and I talked to him for a bit.  I said ""That's Chris Mullin right?""  ""Yea that's him. We're coaches with St. John's, playing Butler tonight."" ""That's awesome, I really liked him on the Pacers."" ""Yea people from Indiana really remember Chris Mullin.""  I think I said something like ""good luck at the game"" but it was only after he walked away that I realized I was talking to Mitch Richmond and I felt like a big dummy. He was very chill and nice and was excited to try the food.   We served some while I wasn't working. Ron Artest came in and I was really bummed to not be there that day. We also had quite a few WNBA players get food, notably Diana Taurasi and Maya Moore. There was one player that always came to get food when she was in town, I think she maybe she worked for ESPN or something too but I'm having trouble remembering her name.  I met Lance Stephenson at a Pacers fan event thing. I said ""how ya doing Lance?"" And shook his hand. He replied ""good"" and walked away.  This goes against the post really but the one time I got to sit courtside I gave Danny Granger a hi-five after he torched the Milwaukee Bucks. That ruled."
"Most of them born in Nigeria. They all played college ball in the US, and many played HS as well. But they're still Nigerians, I think only Jahlil Okafor and Gabe Vincent were born in the US and grew up there from a young age"
I can. His name is Jahlil Okafor
PJ Tucker plays actual defense and understands his role. There is no universe in which Jahlil Okafor can become another PJ Tucker style story.
I remember years ago a dude said Jokic could end up being a better player than Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor and got shit on for it.
"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/sekou-doumbouya-31572/  &gt;Traded to Brooklyn (BKN) from Detroit (DET) with Jahlil Okafor for DeAndre Jordan, $5.78 million , 2022 2nd round pick [BKN pick] , 2027 2nd round pick [BKN pick] , 2024 2nd round pick [WAS or MEM pick (more favorable)] and 2025 2nd round pick [WAS or GSW pick (more favorable)]  it's 'cause Brooklyn _really_ wanted to get DJ off their books."
True. 100% talking about other players wasn’t considering Vucivic when I replied. I was thinking about some former high pick’s like Jahlil Okafor.
I was 100% convinced that Jahlil Okafor was going to be the next big thing and that he would bring the post-oriented big man back into the spotlight. I also thought his Duke teammate Justise Winslow was gonna turn into a LeBron-lite type player.
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
Exact reaction I had lol. Forgot he was part of the Deandre Jordan trade and then the Pistons immediately bought out Jordan so he could go to the Lakers. Jahlil Okafor was part of it too tho I think he was bought as well.
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
What awful draft record? He picked the guys that everyone hyped in each draft (Jahlil Okafor was a very hyped prospect for example). How many GMs have better drafting records than Hinkie did?
"i remember when okafor was drafted, embiid tweeted something like ""????""  edit: just look it up - it was ""ok.... lol""  https://fansided.com/2015/06/25/joel-embiid-reacts-jahlil-okafor-twitter/"
"It's a reference to his draft scouting reports, we all know now there's no comparison lol.  [Philadephia Sports Nation: Ranking the Funniest Pre-Draft Comparisons for 76ers Players](https://www.phlsportsnation.com/2019/08/09/ranking-the-funniest-pre-draft-comparisons-for-76ers-players/)  &gt;1) Jahlil Okafor is the next Tim Duncan: Okafor was the 3rd pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, coming out of Duke after leading them to the National Championship as a Freshman. Jahlil has averaged 11.5 points and 5.1 rebounds per game for his career. Okafor has already been on three teams in just four years in the NBA. He was compared to the greatest Power Forward of all time, Tim Duncan. Name an award and Duncan has it. Two MVPs, 15 All-Star games, five NBA Championships, and three Finals MVPs. Duncan averaged 19 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.2 blocks a game for his career. In his first MVP season, Duncan averaged 25.5 points, 12.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game.  &gt;Best quote: “People don’t casually hand out Tim Duncan comparisons to college prospects. That must mean this Jahlil Okafor kid from Duke is worth the fuss because he’s drawn plenty of comparisons to the Big Fundamental.”"
They should get Jahlil Okafor for his ability to roll out of bed
"Huh?   Which player averaged 30 pts &amp; 12 rebounds in the playoffs vs the Hawks on a torn meniscus?   Which player was a legitimate MVP candidate?   And Ben took all of 7 shots in the 4th quarters of the series and passed up a go ahead dunk late in Game 7?   Ben has never improved on the offensive side of the ball since his rookie season.  Embiid improved himself from a platoon center (sharing the post with Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor), to and All Star to an MVP candidate.    If Ben had simply improved himself to merely league averages in shooting &amp; free throws, the Sixers would have a title by now.  He's too arrogant for merely being a good player.  Shooting 33% from the line in the playoffs and disappearing late in games is not the mark of a max contract player and he should have taken whatever steps to make himself better, instead of throwing a hissy fit because the team who paid him $30+ million per season wants him to not be a liability on the offensive end and not get bullied off the court by a 6'1 , unathletic ball hog.     He didn't get thrown under the bus, he practically laid down and crawled there himself."
Jahlil Okafor  Once he gets his chance I think he will explode. His rookie year his post moves were very refined for a rookie. Then he fell off a cliff.  Just needs a chance as a scorer haha
From Chicago   Played Vs Max Strus and Jalen Brunson   Saw Jabari Parker/Jahlil Okafor sectional games @ my school every year   Almost Played Cliff Alexander in Playoffs but his team was using Ineligible Players lol  And my brother got Dunked on By Iman Shumpert

"Great BBIQ is an exaggeration, and his passing isn't to the point that you actually want to have him as a primary or secondary playmaker, so it's pretty whatever. Prkacin is a better playmaker than Sengun at this point.   Sengun's an extremely skilled post scorer and solid passer. The fact that you have to instantly use his stats and resume to defend him instead of his actual game is pretty much all that needs to be said.   What he is just isn't that attractive in the modern NBA. There's a reason Enes Kanter is on a different team for the minimum and Jahlil Okafor barely got a contract on the worst team in the league. Post scoring is close to worthless when it comes at the tradeoff of defense and shooting."
"Every player in the league is beaming with talent. Including Jahlil Okafor. It’s the NBA. We are talking the best few hundred players in the world.   Doesn’t mean busts can’t be busts.   As to your interpretation of people wanting him to fail, it’s that. Your interpretation. Perhaps people get minority annoyed with how defensive Warriors’ fans get when you bring up how bad he was, but I don’t think people talking about his performance equals rooting for him to fail."

Jahlil Okafor?
Jahlil Okafor was made for 90s back to the basket dinosaur ball
Jahlil Okafor was born 20 years too late
For sure but did you see Jahlil fucking Okafor tear it up for Nigeria against Argentina?
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
"I said that Jahlil Okafor could be an allstar 15-20 years ago on a mediocre team, not in today's nba. Bigs have different defensive assignments than they did back then. It was rare for bigs to guard the perimeter.   And of course Giannis is a skilled. My point was that comparing Jahlil to Giannis doesn't make sense, because any player with Giannis's size and athleticism is going to find a role in the NBA, regardless of other skills. Okafor can't do that because he is slow footed and bottomheavy."
"Nah.  Jahlil Okafor has really nice touch and post moves. If he's the focal point of an offense on a mediocre team, he very well could have been an Allstar.   He could rebound and score well enough to stave off criticism about his defense.   The reason Giannis can compete today is his freakish athleticism, which Okafor clearly doesn't have lol"
"I hate to be a debbie downer, but a team is not going to go very far with jahlil okafor as its top scorer"
"I thought that season AD sat out for the Pelicans (to force a trade), Jahlil looked great starting in place for AD during that stretch. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it felt like he was putting up 20/10 efficiently. The biggest thing I remember was the coaching staff for NOP raving about how Okafor had improved his overall team defense and his work ethic. From the eye test alone, he looked good playing defense during that stretch. I was for sure certain that the following season he would have a much bigger role to play for a team, but I don't know what happened. I still think he could contribute solid minutes in a rotation for a team, or even start, but we'll see. Glad he played well for Nigeria."
Jahlil Okafor is turning back the clock!
"He’s better than Jahlil Okafor, though."
I've heard Grizz fans say JJJ is more like a 3 than even a 4 or 5 when I point out his rebounding. JJJ is one of the worst rebounders ever. Like worse than Andrea Bargnani and Jahlil Okafor.
Jahlil Okafor would’ve been a 20+ ppg scorer for a long time if he was born just 10-15 years earlier

KAT was behind Jahlil Okafor for basically the whole season until Jah got cooked by Frank the Tank
"Wiggins and Kyrie over KAT, as KAT’s standing at #1 was disputed with Jahlil Okafor throughout the pre-draft process"

Look at the box score. Jahlil okafor couldnt even get on the floor for the nigerian team
lol at jahlil okafor getting a dnp on that squad... i was convinced he was gonna be a monster coming out of college
Wait Jahlil Okafor plays for Nigeria but didn’t get PT?
Just think this is Nigeria without Jahlil Okafor.
I had no idea Jahlil Okafor was Nigerian until now
"Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat   KZ Okpala, Miami Heat   Miye Oni, Utah Jazz    Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves   Jordan Nwora, Milwaukee Bucks   Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings   Jahlil Okafor, Detroit Pistons   Gabe Vincent, Miami Heat  Alzo Michael Gbinije and Ekpe Udoh have experience in the NBA."
"NBA players on their roster include:  Precious Achiuwa, Kezie Okpala, Miye Oni, Josh Okogie, Jordan Nwora, Chimezie Metu, Ekpe Udoh, Jahlil Okafor, Gabe Vincent."
Most Draft boards had Andrew Wiggins number 1 and they were proven wrong. Most Draft boards had Jahlil Okafor number 1. Most Draft boards had Markelle Fultz. It's a crap shoot. Especially in a year with no college basketball or workouts 2020 was a hard year to gage.
Jahlil Okafor after carrying the Nigerian squad to the gold medal. Everyone will once again be forced to witness his greatness
Jahlil Okafor will surprise everyone
"Does anyone still say #trusttheprocess unironically at this point?   Whatever fucking process led to trading Mikal Bridges, drafting jahlil Okafor third, etc etc seems worse than cancer tbh"
"&gt;they would have gone #1 and #2 without question  You realize the draft includes college players too right? They way KAT and Jahlil Okafor were hyped up, no one would have take an unproven in Skal high schooler over them 2014. Simmons was much more hyped and woulda definitely been top 3.  And you think without the one and done rule all of those guys would have skipped college? That's not how it usually works. Usually only the top 2 or 3 guys decide to enter into the draft and the rest go to college.   Stephen Zimmerman would have most definitely not been a lottery pick coming out of high school if you include the fact he's competing with not just his hs class but guys like KAT, Okafor, Porzingis, and D'Angelo Russell.  I don't know how this shotty analysis is getting so many upvotes"
"I mean Bagley's the one who hasnt learned how to shoot, faceup, or play defense and instead sticks with being a useless mediocre post player with no D, thats on him. The kings didn't stop fox and cousins from being legit stars. Bagley is just ass. Jahlil Okafor type ass."

And nice, you updated my vocabulary whilst giving me some insight into your expertise with the male anatomy. Kudos to you."

"I actually heard the above news from someone I know who’s kinda close to the Nigerian team, but I also saw this on Twitter (see link below) since I wanted to make sure I wasn’t misleading anyone. That’s the official Nigerian Olympic Basketball team Twitter page (you can see it has a lot of info/photos from the training camp).   I was told guys like Gabe Vincent, Precious Achiuwa, and Jahlil Okafor would be some important pieces. Also Ike Diogu is their veteran leader (he’s played overseas a lot but was a former 1st round pick). Also I believe Jordan Nwora (who’s currently with the Bucks) might be able to make the team if he chooses to play after the Finals is over (his dad is associated with the team so my guess is he doesn’t need as many contractual stipulations).   Nigeria’s group is super balanced but I would say a team like Australia which has a core who’s played together a long time is probably better at this point, but we’ll see what happens. I am rooting for Nigeria over Australia.   https://mobile.twitter.com/NigeriaBasket/status/1409722941005258752"
"Nigeria is ranked way too high. Australia and France are definitely better. Not only is the NBA talent on Australia and France better but their players also haven’t played much with each other.   I think you are overestimating exactly which NBA players are projected to be on the Nigerian team. The best player might end up being Monte Morris and the rest of the team will be some combination of guys like Precious Achiuwa, Jahlil Okafor, and Josh Okogie."
"I believe the Nets traded Trevor Booker for Nik Stauskas, Jahlil Okafor, and a second-rounder. That pick turned into Nicolas Claxton, who seems to be the entirety of the Nets' young core."
"Jahlil Okafor, a 12 pack of Vernors, and a couple refrigerated coney dogs."
Jahlil Okafor. I didn’t see how his old man ass game would translate and it sure didn’t.
I really thought Jahlil Okafor was going to be a solid player and haven’t heard anything about him in years
His success at his age is impossible to ignore but he does give off Jahlil Okafor vibes
I think some players are hard to evaluate in terms of college effort.  Ben Simmons is the prime example of someone who looked awful defensively in college but in actuality was a great defender who didn't give effort in college because regardless he was gonna be a top pick.  Shooting is something scouts used to be iffy on but the translation of free throw shooting to three point percentage has proven to be more useful.  Basically if you can make free throws you probably are going to be a good shooter.  Very few exceptions like Rubio come to mind.  I think post scorers in college have finally been evaluated as largely not translating to the pros.  I think Jahlil Okafor was the last straw.
"Jahlil Okafor put up stats as a Top 3 pick and is now out of the league. Same with Jabari Parker, before my Cs picked him up."
https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-sixers/report-jahlil-okafor-was-celtics-target-proposed-blockbuster  https://www.bostonherald.com/2016/02/20/danny-ainge-makes-team-better-with-waiting/  Can’t find the reporting that Jerry nixed it.  But from Boston’s end it was the unprotected pick that became Jaylen and Okafor was coming back
"&gt;Imagine getting traded to Sacramento or Minnesota as back up to KAT, he'll most likely fall out of the league in less then 5 years.  I'd take a bet against that every day of the week. Wiseman out of the league at age 23... come on. He isn't Jahlil Okafor. Kid has legitimate skills and good footspeed for his size."
"Show me some wnba rotation players with the post moves of say, Jahlil Okafor"
"A 105 rating in an era where teams scored 89 is like a 142 rating in today’s era. Chuck played defense like a throwback Jahlil Okafor, and still made the HoF. My man respect."
"Dame to Detroit. Portland gets Plumlee, Jahlil Okafor, and Saben Lee. No take backs. /s"
So was Jahlil Okafor
"Looking at the highlight every shot was within 1-3 feet from the basket. He has good footwork, but low post scoring is the least valued skill in the current NBA. Jahlil Okafor looked more polished offensively with a similar game, and look where he is at."
"Another way to word this is ""Every team that Jahlil Okafor joins is terrible"" or ""Every team that gives Jahlil Okafor minutes gets immediately worse"". I guess if you're tanking it makes sense to bring him on board but other than that it just isn't a good look for him"
Jahlil “Taylor Hall” Okafor
so what you are telling me is Jahlil Okafor is the ultimate tank Commander?
"&gt;&gt; To be a center you just have to be born tall  I mean tell that to Nikola Jokic. Hell tell that to Jahlil Okafor or any of the host of other 7-footers who can't cut it in today's league. The skill level required to play center in the NBA is extremely high, higher than it's ever been. There have been really tall people in Europe for a long time - better player development is driving the emergence of all these foreign bigs.    But yes, being a guard requires more relative skill, and the rest of the world is still catching up there."
Jahlil Okafor
"Imagine sitting through years of the process watching ish smith and Jahlil Okafor and loosing to the hawks lol, I would be mad too"
"Michael Carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Evan Turner, Joel Embiid....   God this team's drafting was not great under Hinkie."
Ben Simmons for Jahlil Okafor. He’s coming home.
Jahlil Okafor
"Imagine needing Jahlil Okafor to get a number one pick, just man up and suck for a decade"
Tank commander Jahlil Okafor
Still not worth having Jahlil Okafor on your team for a year.
Jahlil “Taylor Hall” Okafor
I’m a dukie - I thought the lakers should’ve taken Jahlil Okafor and he was gonna be their next MVP level center
"There are a sizable number of NBA players with one Nigerian parent. Bam, Iggy, and Jahlil Okafor are also included in that group."
"It’s insane you guys had 5 straight top 6 picks (two #1, two #3 and #6) and took Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz with 4 of them. Embiid was a huge win but man that is a brutal group of 4."
"He probably does the same thing once he sees that Trae Young is the superstar he's looking for. Remember he got booted before he even got to see Embiid play, as well as evaluate what he has in Simmons. The best players during his time were Nerlens Noel &amp; Jahlil Okafor, who are now backup C's at best."
"Let's look at Hinkie's first round draft record:   * 2013: Michael Carter-Williams (11th) - ROY, flipped for another first rounder * 2014: Joel Embiid (franchise player), Dario Saric (starter, part of Jimmy Bulter trade) * 2015: Jahlil Okafor (bust).  * Pre-2016 draft: Hinkie forced out, Colangelo takes over. * 2016 draft, just for context: The Colangelo-led Sixers draft Ben Simmons #1 overall  I only see one lottery whiff on Hinkie's record (Okafor.) So I don't know where you're getting that from.   The Hinkie-accumulated assets were mostly used to 1) trade up for Markelle Fultz in the draft (Colangelo) and 2) to trade for Jimmy Butler and 3) trade for Tobias Harris (both Elton Brand)."
Man that's cool for bam but such a bummer for Nigeria. I get he grew up here but Nigeria is down to let Jahlil Okafor play and he's from Arkansas as much as he's African lol
"The most frustrating thing is how years later they pretend like no one could have seen it coming!  Like I had 76ers fans in another thread trying to accuse me of re-writing history by saying Jahlil Okafor was a terrible pick.  FOH, literally every single casual non-homer knew that Jahlil's career would play out exactly how it did. It was just 76ers fans who convinced themselves that they'd somehow be able to fix him."
Pretty sure this happens a lot. Like Josh Jackson refused to work out for the Celtics. Kristaps Porzingis refused to workout or be interviewed by the Sixers. Luka refused to give medical records to the Kings. Mo Bamba told the Grizzlies not to draft him. Jahlil Okafor told the Sixers not to draft him. Jabari Parker allegedly 'tanked' his workout with the Cavs so they wouldn't draft him.  Hell Steph Curry refused to workout for any team except the Knicks. Kobe Bryant was telling every team in the league he would only play for the Lakers all the way back in 1996.   Long story short it happens all the time. Sometimes the player gets what they want. Sometimes they don't.
"sometimes you get KAT, sometimes you get Jahlil Okafor"
"I think you should just accept that there is no improving with him. [Even LSU's beat writer had a scouting report pre-draft](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-76ers/not-worthy-no-1-lsu-reporter-details-concerns-ben-simmons ) that just matches what we see of him today.  &gt;""To me, he's more of a specialist player and a complementary player than someone who can really take over a team,"" Guilbeau said. ""He's not a strong, inside player like a brute. A physical player. And he also does not shoot from the outside, which is amazing, but he's a great passer and a great scorer.""  &gt;Complementary player? Can't take over a team? Say what?  &gt;""I don't think he should be the first pick,"" Guilbeau said. ""I can see him being a high first-round pick. It depends on the team he's going to. Do they have enough of the other parts of the team where he can be a facilitator and a complementary player?  &gt;""He would have to go to a team where he can flourish as a complementary player, a team that has a very good center.""  &gt;The Sixers are loaded in the front court with Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel and potentially Joel Embiid. But a first overall pick is not supposed to be a complementary player.  &gt;""I think you could develop him to be as good as he could be, but not be that type of star,"" Guilbeau said. ""It's kind of strange to me. Before he ever played he was supposed to be the greatest player, and I just never saw it. I covered great players here like Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Jackson, and he just didn't change a team like those guys did."""
Markelle Fultz   Zhaire Smith  Michael Carter-Williams   Ben Simmons   Jahlil Okafor
"Also, with Detroit, they will likely get another high selection tomorrow, along with the fact that they’re very willing to take up reclamation projects (see Jahlil Okafor, Dennis Smith Jr, etc). Their willingness to do that, such as Houston did with Kevin Porter Jr, could lead to them finding multiple gems though smart deals. Plus, they have a lot of seconds to work with thanks to the Cory Joseph and other trades."
"Oh, I realize that’s what Sam Hinkie did.  My question is “why couldn’t the 76ers improve like some other teams do without totally tanking for three years?”  I mean, if Hinkie was such a good GM, then he has the ability to make good draft picks and not pick guys like Jahlil Okafor, who was known as a suspect defensive player at Duke, especially when he’s already picked centers high in the two previous drafts.  Here’s the other issue with “The Process” - if you DO hit on a draft pick and that player becomes a superstar caliber player, that player isn’t going to tolerate losing often for too long if he’s a guy who is good enough to improve a team from say 20 wins to 30-35 wins but not good enough to lead that team to the playoffs (which is usually the case because even guys who dramatically improve their teams need some solid players to help them).  There’s still a need for talent evaluation acumen to get an additional superstar player and other good players on the team, especially when the first superstar player is still on his rookie contract.  And that margin for error is smaller when you want guys to sit out for 1-2 years to recover from injuries and keep the team bad to ensure higher draft picks."
Apparently there was internal pressure from Harris and sixers ownership for Hinkie to take Okafor over porzingis.  https://www.phillyvoice.com/reports-sixers-ownership-pressured-sam-hinkie-take-jahlil-okafor-over-kristaps-porzingis/
"&gt; but even if he did make that trade as soon as he saw Fultz shoot he would have taken another player.  Because Hinkie was such a master drafter? Come on man, the guy selected Jahlil Okafor despite being a supposed ""analytic genius"""
"We’ve seen some big market franchises suck pretty bad. The Lakers from ‘14 to signing LeBron were bad (the worst that particular franchise has ever been), the Raptors were perpetually bad until Ujiri got there, the Rockets have stunk it up this year, the Knicks went and sucked for 2 separate 8 season stretches with like a 3 year break in the middle for Carmelo Anthony. But they at least made coherent roster moves and you can see the logic in how their rosters were *supposed* to work. They just didn’t.  No GM made a slate of selections over a 3 year period that were as incoherent as Hinkie’s and still kept their job. There was never a world where Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahlil Okafor all were supposed to coexist together on a winning roster. Hinkie was terrific at gathering draft capital, horrible at spending it at the actual draft."
Dragan Bender - lol  Jahlil Okafor - lol  DeAndre Jordan - maybe a bit of a lol  Andre Drummond - oh god  DeMarcus Cousins - wasn't his fault he got fucked by his body  Andrew Wiggins - meh
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
"Absolutely not. The Process was one of the most pathetic things a front office has ever done. They spent 4 years publicly declaring their intention to lose games to collect good draft picks, but all they did was instill a losing culture on their young players causing them to whither. Guys like MCW, Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel actually started off looking like good players before they realized their team had no intention of developing them.  The Raptors tried to tank for Wiggins in 2014 by trading away Rudy Gay. But the players we got for him started us on a winning streak and Masai just went with it and kept building on it instead of trying to shoot for a jackpot player in the draft."
"Hinkie drafted Michael Carter-Williams, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor.  Let's not pretend he knew how to spot talent and would have done any better if hadn't been pushed out.  His only good pick was Embiid and what a great pick it was.  But that's literally the only good pick he made."
"The 76ers have Jahlil Okafor instead of Ben Simmons. Do they win series, yes or no?"
Ben Simmons is just Jahlil Okafor with passing ability
Or Devin Booker over Jahlil Okafor
It's worth finding the Jahlil Okafor or Jokic thread. lol
TJ McConnell  Nik Stauskas  Robert Covington  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlens Noel   Checkmate.
Yeah Jahlil okafor as mvp woulda been absolutely wild
I am an honorary Process Sixers fan and to prove it I'm naming the entire 15-16 team one by one  PG: Ish Smith/TJ Mcconnell/Kendall Marshall  SG: Hollis Thompson/Isaiah Canaan/Nik Stauskas  SF: Robert Covington/JaKarr Sampson  PF: Carl Landry/Jerami Grant/Elton Brand  C: Jahlil Okafor/Nerlens Noel
"To maybe find a middle ground, I liked the Adams trade, but I didn't like the extension. When Favors left, we were left with absolutely no startable big men. Christian Wood had been released the year prior and gone to Detroit, and showed real promise there. Jahlil Okafor would have 24 good seconds in a game before his athleticism just made him a liability. He had some good games, but they were few and far between. Finally, Hayes was too young and inexperienced, he wasn't even supposed to play NBA minutes in his rookie year when the Pelicans drafted him.  All this to say that they needed a big man, and unless they wanted to pay for someone like Aaron Baynes, dumping those picks and guys they weren't resigning or had previously planned to release like Frank Jackson and Kenrich Williams seems like a fair tradeoff to me. But like you've said, the extension was not good when compared to market value, and the fact that you can find a low cost center in free agency in the off-season, or a better trade candidate.  Some people argue that he was also an extension target because of his attitude he brings to the team. I think that's pretty crappy speculation, we have no reason to believe that's anything more than wishful thinking for a fanbase."
"KAT is the player he is. He is not supposed to be similar to anyone else. In his draft year Jahlil Okafor was seen as the tough, not soft big man, so..."
"Fuck that man I want everyone talking trash. I want Ricky Rubio talking shit to Chris Paul. I want Jae Crowder threatening to home invade a Lopez brother. I want Embiid to catch and chug two milk shakes, Stone Cold style, right before he goes on a monologue of hate to Jahlil Okafor. I want the Clippers to raise a Joe Ingles pinata before every game."
I think it was a success. They got two great players in Embiid and Simmons. It's unfortunate about Fultz (1st Overall) and Jahlil Okafor (3rd Overall)
"Gotta be able to defend, look at Jahlil Okafor. Great low post scorer but can’t move his feet quick enough so he gets played off the floor."
KOC told a great story on Bill's pod sometime back. When he was still working the philly beat he got a tip about Jahlil Okafor getting himself into a situation where a gun was pointed at him. So KOC verifies the tip and calls the sixers just to get a comment on it. The sixers wouldnt deny it but asked him to give them 15 minutes so they can tell Woj about it first.
jahlil okafor in like 2016 for the 10 win 76ers
"Nothing but full faith in our FO. All four of our rookies have shown that they have a place in this league. Two of our rookies have clearly outplayed their draft position. For all the shit Weaver got for our bizarre off-season, it looks like his worst move was giving Jahlil Okafor two years guaranteed at the minimum."
&gt; I am still surprised Jahlil Okafor still hasn't found his footing in in NBA.  Traditional power forwards are dinosaurs in todays league. He would have been set in the 90s.
"Sixers top picks ended up injured regardless of their injury history.  Embid, fultzs, and the allergy guy missed time even when the Sixers were competing for the playoffs.  I just wanted to say that choosing players spefically because they were injured is disingenuous.  I agree that choosing 2 big men in nerlens noel and jahlil okafor and then embid because they were the best player available is bad on hinlies part. It was the right move but creating a logjam in the frontcourt made the tank even more pronounced."
Trading up for Pasecniks because you need a draft and stash player because you don't have a roster spot and you don't want to waive Jahlil Okafor or Nik Stauskas
"what if they had picked Jahlil Okafor in 2015 and Dragan Bender in 2016 (the 3rd and 4th pick in their drafts, respectively). are they still able to trade for AD?"
Jahlil Okafor  CP3
Im sorry but in what world were you living in where you thought Jahlil Okafor could become what Randle is currently??
"Commitment and hard work baby!  Honestly, what he is now is what I thought Jahlil Okafor needed to become when he got drafted to succeed in the NBA. I thought Jahlil could do it too, as it turns out, Randle was gonna be the dude."
Jahlil Okafor and it is not even close.
Jahlil Okafor will always be my answer to this question
"Jahlil Okafor was a tadlate.  Probably could’ve been an all star, near all star, in the previous era with how good his post game was before it was about spacing."
Jahlil Okafor
Jahlil Okafor
"If you can't play defense, you're not getting paid either. Look at Jahlil Okafor, a great back-to-the-basket offense, but just a traffic cone on defense."
Jahlil Okafor sighting
Almost like we’ve been saying he was a stud for years while we got downvoted by people who thought Jahlil Okafor was going to be better. It has been a long time coming
"It would be a great series. In still pissed we didn’t get to see Embiid vs Jokic this year, or even in the 2nd matchup last year. Our championship hopes are pretty much shot but I think we could still make some noise in the playoffs if we don’t have to face the healthy Lakers first round. Would be sick for a big man to win it, and even sicker for a 2nd round pick to win it, I think the previous latest draft position of an MVP winner was #15. Jokic was picked #42, and even a few years ago people were saying he was worse than Jahlil Okafor and stuff lol. Unreal underdog story."
"Like I said, Gortat. Chris Kaman. Jahlil Okafor. Vucevic (not quite avg, I know). Al Jefferson. Kanter etc. There are tons of them."
Markelle fultz and jahlil okafor?
"My ideal starting 5 for this necessary tank game:  \-Jahlil Okafor  \-Corey Joseph  \-Saben Lee  \-Tyler Cook  \- Servydis Deividas  Just run them for the whole game, that should do it."
"I thought Jahlil Okafor would be a star.   I know the league was already trending towards small-ball and 3pt shooting, which Okafor fits neither of those categories but his post game was so advanced that I thought it was just too good even for the modern NBA."
Never forget those games Embiid started at PF next to Jahlil Okafor.
"[Yeah, that was him.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14237711/philadelphia-76ers-rookie-jahlil-okafor-had-gun-pointed-previous-altercation-report-says)"
Jahlil Okafor will roll out of bed and get 20 in this league.
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood. Not ashamed to admit that I thought the highlight of Christian Wood's career would be backing up Jahlil Okafor as they were punching out drunkards outside a Boston nightclub.
jahlil okafor sighting
"Brandon Jennings, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo were the first that came to mind. Maybe Jahlil Okafor too. His first season was ok in those abysmal Philly years."
"You're acting like gordon hayward is like an ancient bigman like jahlil okafor or some shit, he literally would fit like a glove on any team you put him on."
Ok is everyone forgetting they already have the post god Jahlil Okafor? How much help do the Pistons need??
"Great game for Sexton, he was lights out. Also, not that it's relevant but I never really processed that the Pistons can almost run a lineup of just top 5 picks when healthy between Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Josh Jackson, and Jahlil Okafor."
Idk Kaminsky is better than Jahlil Okafor who did win it that year
Enes “jahlil okafor” Kanter
"You're conflating two things: winning the games vs playing in a way that contributes *towards* winning games.  Unless you're a generationally elite player (LeBron, MJ, Kobe etc) you aren't going to win games on your own, no matter how well you play individually. But it's still possible to play good, meaningful basketball even if your team doesn't win. Whereas there are guys who accumulate box score numbers while playing in a way that does not make the team better. Empty stats guys do exist, but the way most people apply the term is wrong.  LaVine and Booker both played on teams with very limited surrounding talent, yet despite being forced to carry the burden almost single handedly, they managed to score at high efficiency on high volume, while also having to rebound and handle playmaking duties despite not being true point guards. That type of efficient play makes teams better, and without them, their teams would have lost far more than with them.  Then there's guys like MCW or Jahlil Okafor, who both scored over 16ppg but did so in terrible efficiency while playing a style of basketball that demonstrably does not contribute to winning games. Those are empty stats guys.  There's a reason why guys like LaVine and Booker can settle in amongst better lineups and still contribute as high level starters, while guys like MCW and Okafor both went from starters on bad teams, to reserves on ok teams, to now both being nearly out of the league before turning 30."
"I don’t know why people think Jahlil Okafor could have been a star in the league earlier. His post game is okay, but nothin special and he is terribly defensively. The centers of the 90’s would have eaten that dude for breakfast."
"Nah, that’s no excuse because everybody knew Hayes was 2-3 years away minimum body and experience wise alone. Zion is a 4 and he still basically chose Jahlil Okafor over him if you wanna put it like that and that’s just inexcusable. Jahlil Okafor is a worse version of Enes Kanter and we all know how Kanter is seen in this league. At the least he coulda traded a guard to free up a spot cuz lord knows we had so many of them last year"
Actually Christian Wood was balling on the Pels down the stretch after we acquired him and I was very confused and disappointed that we cut him over guys who clearly weren’t quality NBA material like Jahlil Okafor
"Second season and he’s already made plenty of mistakes like cutting Christian Wood before last season despite Derrick Favors being our only good Big man on the team. The other options were Jahlil Okafor, rookie Jaxson Hayes and Niko Melli 💀"
"Yeah Jahlil Okafor is incredibly skilled in the post, he has better footwork than most bigs in the league right now. Saying he just overpowered people is wrong.  His main issues are that he sucks ass at defense, can't shoot from beyond 10 ft, and is a black hole that won't pass the ball once he gets it. That and I think some attitude/work ethic issues."
"Nah, Jahlil had incredible skill and scoring feel for his size. His game isn't a good fit for the modern NBA, but 2015 we weren't all the way there yet - Al Jefferson was All-NBA just a year before. Okafor *definitely* lacked the emotional maturity to deal with the losing and too-many-centers drama of those first couple of Sixers years, so he sulked and pouted when things didn't go his way rather than working his ass off to fix his flaws and earn his spot.   He was a killer at Whitney Young and at Duke - there are lots of alternate universes where Jahlil turned into a solid, or even good, NBA player."
"&gt; Neither of those guys have anywhere near the defensive impact JJJ has.  Jaren has a terrible defensive impact in large part due to his ridiculous fouling rate.  &gt;Good shooters but not shoot 40% from 3 on like 7 attempts a game good.  Imagine thinking Jaren Jackson is a better 3 point shooter than Steve Novak. Jaren had more attempts because 3 point attempts are up for everyone every year.  &gt;Not thinking JJJ is the absolute definition of a damn unicorn is peak I don't watch games bullshit.  Thinking Jaren Jackson is a unicorn when he terrible statistically (his team has been worse with him on the court), fouls at a crazy high rate that makes his defense terrible, and rebounds at a rate that is so bad it makes Jahlil Okafor look like Dennis Rodman. JJJ is a unicorn the same way a Andrea Bargnani/Steve Novak hybrid would be. Good three point shooter and tall but terrible on defense and terrible at rebounding."
"Naw you must be reading the box scores only if you think Bargnani and Novak are unflattering comparisons for JJJ. There are bigman that play good offense but not defense, there are bigman that play good defense but not offense. There are few bigman that can't rebound a lick and make his team much worse at rebounding whenever he is on the court two years in a row and have a TRB% around 10%. Usually those guys phase out like Jahlil Okafor."
"Detroit Pistons are certainly your team. They’re the closest team to Canada, as you can see Detroit from Canada. They have two all-NBA players in Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, which there are teams out there that have never had a guy make all-NBA.  Mason Plumpee is in his 7th season, which is a known notorious time for players to really make a jump in skill, so it’s possible they have another all-NBA guy soon. Jahlil Okafor is a former top 3 pick, and he might explode into an all-star soon as well. Between Griffin, Plumlee, and Okafor they average a whopping 28 points per game! Not only that, all 3 combine for 0.8 blocks a game, so they have some real dominant rim protection!  They have a rookie named Killian Hayes, who has exploded onto the scene and is the top rookie out there right now, potentially their 4th all-NBA guy. He’s already averaging 4.6 points per game, so by the time he hits Plumlee’s experience he’ll probably be averaging 9 points per game! He shoots a blistering 28% from the field and 25% from 3 point land. This means that he hits roughly one out of every four shots he takes. Now that’s not quite Steph Curry level yet, it’s hard to envision him not getting to that level as a shooter going off of his promising start to his rookie campaign.  The fans are amazing and passionate fans. Ron Artest loved the fans in Detroit so much that he actually got a game stopped because he wanted to go socialize with the average Detroitian. They ended up fist bumping and having a great relationship even though it messed with the game.  So all in all, I don’t see a reason why not to go with the Pistons. The two already all-NBA guys are a great base, seeing Plumlee develop into one will be a treat, and I already explained how Killian Hayes may be the second coming of Steph Curry. I wouldn’t expect that much this year from them, but next year they are real candidates to break the all time wins record of 73-9, so you can hop on the bandwagon early and then when they take the league over you’ll be one proud papa peacock."
"Guys like Embiid and Jokic are the exceptions that prove the rule. The Warriors won 3 rings with JaVale McGee and Zaza Pachulia, the Rockets with Harden found a new gear when they went full time small ball. It's not the 90s-early 2000s anymore where you need a good center to contend. Post moves have been mostly legislated out of the game.    Roy Hibbert went from an all-star to out of the league in a few years, Dwight Howard went from Superman to a journeyman (I love him on this team but that's just what he is now), Jahlil Okafor is barely in the league after winning a national title and getting picked #3 overall.    The centers who are the best players on their teams need to have some kind of transcendental skill. Jokic is a full-fledged point center, Embiid can take over games with Harden-like offense, Davis is a terror on both ends. But if you can get a 7 footer who can get his arms up and give you 6 fouls you can win if you have other stars.    The Nets will be fine with Jordan and Noah Vonleh or someone like that, they already got the hard part out of the way."
did jahlil okafor play last year? Thats the biggest shock of the season for me
&gt; Like the dude has consistently bullied other teams.  I watched this man go toe to toe with Jahlil Okafor and Bismarck Biyombo last season and lose
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
now imagine if they'd taken Porzingis instead of Jahlil Okafor...
Can confirm. His team beat Jahlil Okafor when Okafor was like the #2 recruit in HS
Have you seen the Jahlil Okafor vid?
"Jahlil Okafor was born about 15 years too late. Post-scoring centric big men with slow feet and questionable defense have pretty much died out with the emergence of athletic rim-runners like Dwight + spread pick&amp;rolls popularized by the 7SOL Suns  Boban if he can play over 30mins a night is an All-Star in the 80s/90s, his size alone would make him a walking mismatch every night for everyone bar the largest of centers like Mark Eaton"
I forgot Jahlil Okafor existed for a while
Jahlil Okafor is on the Pistons I just found out last week.
I’m also positive the process Sixers ran this lineup in their darkest days   PG: Jakarr Sampson 6’7  SG: Hollis Thompson 6’8  SF: Jerami Grant: 6’9  PF: Jahlil Okafor 6’11  C: Nerlens Noel 6’11  406 inches
I really thought Jahlil Okafor would be the next tim duncan
Do you always take everything literally? Or do you genuinely think I meant every single person in the world thought Jahlil Okafor would be a top 5 pick?
"&gt;Favorite for the #1 pick for a majority of the season, figures to go no lower than 3rd in the 2015 Draft …  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/jahlil-okafor/  https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/235737/Jahlil-Okafor-Remains-Consensus-No-1-Player-In-2015-NBA-Draft  https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-mock-draft-consensus-expert-predictions-2015-6?r=US&amp;IR=T#2-los-angeles-lakers--jahlil-okafor-c-2  https://www.nbadraft.net/nba-mock-drafts/?year-mock=2015"
Capitol Hill police defense reminded me of [Jahlil Okafor](https://youtu.be/Xbf_AukNAn8)
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
Jahlil Okafor
"Michael Beasley- Thought he'd be Melo 2.0  Derrick Williams- Thought he'd be a 20 ppg highlight machine  Justise Winslow- I'm still on Winslow island, but I thought he'd be Draymond light by now  and the one i'm most ashamed of was Jahlil Okafor, after watching one to many ball is life mixtapes of him dominating 6'7 highschoolers and LeBron leaving I was down with Tank to the Floor for Okafor  Bonus reel is Hassan Whiteside convincing me he was Wilt reincarnate after a half a season"
Jahlil Okafor
"Also centers who couldn’t shoot but could do other things like Roy hibbert, Greg Monroe, jahlil okafor, derick favors, and al Jefferson would greatly benefit from playing in a different era."
Jahlil Okafor
Jahlil Okafor in the 80s
Would’ve liked to see Jahlil Okafor play in the 80’s and 90’s. He would be getting touches in the post on every possession.
Jahlil Okafor. Would have been one of the best offensive bigs 10-20 years ago. Similar to Al Jefferson
"He's actually what jahlil Okafor wishes he was, rolling out of bed with twenty and ten, but it turns out that being unable to defend is still a massive detriment lol"
You're mentally ill if you think he's better than Jahlil Okafor
"This is exactly right. Drafts aren’t perfect, but to the top 5-ish picks are expected to be starters and capable of averaging 15-20 ppg. That’s Wiggins. Markelle Fultz is getting there. Jahlil Okafor probably won’t. If Wiggins was a true bust, he’d be out of the league."
Most likely Jahlil Okafor
I distinctly remember Wood getting very little time (team was more invested in developing the bigs in front of him in the rotation) but looking freaking great when he was on. Fucking Jahlil Okafor and all the time and resources we wasted on that dude....
"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
Dont you remember rookie of the year jahlil okafor?
Joel Embiid   First Half : Hakeem The Dream   Second Half : Jahlil Okafor
"the consensus was that he wouldn't be a #1 option because he didn't really get to play that way at Kentucky (despite handling the ball a lot).  Here's an except of his draft profile from [SI:](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/23/nba-draft-player-rankings-big-board-karl-anthony-towns-jahlil-okafor)  &gt; It’s not clear if Booker has any NBA-level skills other than his shooting. At Kentucky, he was surrounded by so much talent that he functioned more as a role player than go-to scorer. Booker should inherit a similar role in the NBA, but a team looking for big-time shot creator right away may be wary of selecting him too high in this draft. Booker’s lack of defensive disruptiveness may be cause for concern. He posted a lower steal rate than every other Kentucky player who averaged at least 11 minutes per game and blocked only 0.3% of opponents’ two-point attempts, according to kenpom.com."
"Notable players drafted ahead of Devin Booker in 2015: Jahlil Okafor, Willie Cauley-Stein, Mario Hezonja, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles"
THE BEST 3RD OVERALL PICK OF ALL TIME  **JAHLIL OKAFOR**
"*DUN DUN DUN*  FROM THE DEPTHS, **JAHLIL OKAFOR** RISES FROM THE ASHES TO SAVE THE 76ERS FRANCHISE"
"Jahlil Okafor, I was all in on him"
You think trying to win with MCW and Jahlil Okafor was the better option? Be real. If Fultz didn’t fuck his shoulder and forget how to shoot they probably would’ve and they took the championship winning Raps to 7 and lost by a buzzer beater.
https://www.nba.com/stats/players/roll-man/ Throughout this year he's ranked as a lower percentile as a roll man than notorious studs such as Terry Rozier and Jahlil Okafor. 2.6% frequency with a .8 points per possession.
