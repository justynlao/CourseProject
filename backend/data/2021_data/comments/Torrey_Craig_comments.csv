I always thought he was being used as a prototyoe Torrey Craig.
"Marques Johnson said on tonight's broadcast he is second behind Giannis in Points Per Shot Taken, which surprised me lol. He doesn't really ever take shots. He was getting a lot of mins with torrey Craig out and didn't provide much in terms of offense/ball handling... He has pretty good defense and crazy athleticism. A lot of energy, but very chaotic. He's appropriately talented as a 15th man imo"
can you post the torrey craig block from the bucks game that shit was crazy
"Yeah, if we evolve into a competitive team (ojalá), then Culver will be a quality player to fill that Torrey Craig type niche"
Dozier is injured. RJ takes his role as Torrey Craig.
"Thomas was a really good team/perimeter defender. In the same mold as Royce O’Neale and Torrey Craig today.   The type of player that isn’t that valuable on terrible teams like those Knicks, but very good on an actual playoff team."
Is Defense the problem in Denver? They let go of Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig so I figure their defense has been weak?
wait Torrey Craig is playing over thanasis
Torrey Craig
"Torrey Craig was injured when the Lakers faced us, you should note that as well"
then include torrey craig instead who they magically decided needs to be behind Thanasis in the rotation all of a sudden
Trade scraps for defensive players in the Stanley Johnson/Royce O'Neale/Torrey Craig mold.
"At the moment there’s really not any one that I can think of but that doesn’t mean there won’t ever be. You can’t sit here and tell me he’s not making poor decisions. We got Torrey Craig who is amazing defender and yet Bud plays DJA, Forbes and Thanasis over him"
"How come nobody is giving Denver FO shit for letting Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig go? Where's that ""letting a washed Trevor Ariza go"" energy."
"Woah this is a good point. Thanasis isn’t an awful player, but his play for sure doesn’t match the minutes he’s getting. Torrey Craig balled out for the Nuggets."
[this is what Torrey Craig tweeted after the nuggets let him walk](https://twitter.com/tcraig_23/status/1330277236960858116)   now he is getting absolutely no love from the Bucks lmao
"The real question we should be asking is why the fuck the Bucks are playing Giannis' G-League quality brother ahead of legit NBA talent like Torrey Craig, it's embarrassing and unbecoming."
If only we had some switchable wing like Dorian Finney-Smith or Torrey Craig to help out our defense. Maybe we can trade for one who knows
Is Torrey Craig hurt?
Bud playing Giannis' brother over Torrey Craig? Wtf
"Interesting things that I'm keeping watch of:  - How Schroder does on offense vs. Jrue, Bucks will dare him to shoot  - Who defends LeBron for the Bucks now? It was Wes last year, but he is now on the Lakers.   - How will both teams play their bigs, Gasol/Brook vs. Harrell/Portis. Would tend to think that Gasol/Brook will play more as each team is comfortable with playing big.   - Who plays on each team's bench, Lakers and Bucks each essentially played 9 guys in their last games on MLK day. That would mean Caruso/Wes/Kuzma/Harrell vs. Augustin/Forbes/Connaughton/Portis. I think now would be a good time for Bud to drop one of the guards, probably Forbes, in favor of Torrey Craig.   - Bucks late game offense, do they keep running Jrue/Giannis and Middleton/Giannis PnR at the end of games?"
We also have Torrey Craig but haven't used him yet.. SMH
"It’s not that Jokic needs help, the entire team needs help you can’t replace Torrey Craig, Plumlee, and Grant with 6-7 dudes who have either never played in the nba before or are g-league vets"
"Bucks:  PG: Jrue / Augustin  SG: DiVincenzo / Forbes  SF: Middleton / Connaughton   PF: Giannis / Torrey Craig  C: Lopez / Portis   Nets:  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown  SG: Harden / Shamet  SF: Joe Harris / TLC  PF: KD / Jeff Green  C: DAJ / Claxton   Am I the only one who doesn't think that their benches are that terrible? I think both teams are in desperate need of a proper backup center, but if you wanted to reduce each team down to an 8-man rotation you could do that with ease.   I will admit though that I am kinda worried about the Bucks bench guys on the defense end; Augustin is a solid backup floor general but is undersized. Forbes and Portis have been known to be black holes on defense.  I get what you're saying about the weaknesses in both of their rotations but I'm decently high on the guys. Obviously the talent is top heavy but they aren't scrubs by any means."
"We're hard capped this season (I think its because we used the bi annual, but I'm not certain).  Have to wait until next year aside from 1 prorated vet min signing in the last half of the year.  We have like 700k in cap space.  Getting Torrey Craig back from injury will help though, at least better than all those Forbes minutes."
i dont think I've ever seen torrey craig step on the court once this entire season
Every minute Thanasis plays  Every completed alley oop initiated by DJ Augustin  Every time Donte misses a layup  Finish your drink if DJ Wilson or Torrey Craig get on the floor
"Plumlee, Grant, Torrey Craig... we are much less defensively tough this year..."
Also lost Torrey Craig
"The front office fucked up so bad. It makes no sense why we didn't sign or trade for any wings. Torrey Craig was in closing lineups in the playoffs and wanted to re-sign, yet the front office didn't offer him anything and he signed with the bucks for the minimum.  We play 4 Guard lineups sometimes nd our only competent 'wing' defenders are Garry Harris who is too small, Barton who is braindead sometimes and is about 50lbs too light, PJ Dozier who is actually ok and MPJ who sucks on defence"
Does Torrey Craig get mins on the Bucks? I haven’t really watched them yet
Torrey Craig WTFFFFF YOOOOO
"bucks really did a good job rounding out their roster with augustin, digiorno and forbes, feels unfair almost  and they got torrey craig too?"
"Yes please. Him, Jrue, Donte, Torrey Craig may just reach goat tier backcourt defense"
"they lost many good defenders like Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig and Jamal Murray isn't that good. MPJ hasn't played yet."
Torrey Craig? He’s practically on the minimum. Not really the same situation as the others
"yes, that's my point thank you - plenty of people showcase their abilities in denver, and malone plays barton regardless  beasley, torrey craig, jerami grant"
"It's because they let Plumlee leave without signing another 5. They barely play Bol Bol and don't have another big to fill in that spot. There bench has been great for the past few seasons and Plumlee was part of the reason why, this offseason though they let go Plumlee, and Torrey Craig, in addition to Jerami Grant, wifhout filling in those spots. I hope they can bounce back."
"Fwiw, Grant was one of the few players to pass through here to have a negative net rating in lineups with Jokic. Grant, Torrey Craig, Mudiay, Trey Lyles and that’s about it. He’s positive with everyone else"
"""And of course, Torrey Craig ..."""

"Covington is so over rated on defence. He isn't quick enough to deal with elite quick guards, CP3 targeted the supposed elite defender over and over last playoffs and he isn't strong enough to guard Lebron or other bigger wings either. Rich mans Torrey Craig lol"
"Need to trade Barton for a wing defender, then cut someone else to make room for Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Gotta replace Torrey Craig and Jerami Grant defensive presence."
"Idk why you would mention roster like you improved the whole roster..  You improved your guard play with Jrue. So yes your top 3 players got a lot better, thus to an extent your top 5.. but the rest of the roster are still lack luster, Augustin and Forbes are defensive liability, Torrey Craig is offensive liability, Bobby Portis is meh.   Roster in its entirety didn’t exactly take a massive upgrade really. So hopefully Bud will stick more minutes to the starter and that’s a good thing I hope"
"Jokic is amazing, and my favorite player, but the Nuggets really look like they're going to take a step back this year.  I like some of the pieces but this team is really poorly built, no size, no depth, no defense. How can you play a backcourt with Campazzo and Morris? Why get rid of Torrey Craig to sign Campazzo?"
As did Torrey Craig.
I wish Torrey Craig would recover already. We need that defense
Torrey “Ersan İlyasova” Craig
Antetokounmpo Middleton Holiday Lopez Divincenzo Portis Forbes Connaughton  That’s pretty much our core rotation minus Augustin and whoever between Torrey Craig and Thanasis Bud is trying to play
Torrey Craig sighting
"We lost jerami grant and torrey Craig mpj has been a disappointement and looks to be only good as scorer without any basketball iq,gary harris offensive decline has been a lot steeper than expected jamal murray has returned to his inconsistent self and will barton has forgotten how to play basketball"
Torrey Craig nearly blew it
"It was Torrey Craig, don't slander my guy Jerami Grant like that."
"Not even the most boneheaded thing Nuggets have done in the last few months. Throwback to being 2 points up, game 7 of the first round vs Jazz 4 seconds left, fast break, Torrey Craig decides to lay it up and miss instead of wasting clock/getting fouled to setup a fast break 3 for Conley which fortunately rimmed out.  The stakes on that boneheaded play were huge."
"A 1-on-1 tournament has always been one of those things that sounds way better in theory than in practice.   It might depend whether you have any basketball experience to know this but serious 1-on-1 battles can be exhausting, which is weird because you assume things wouldn't be so bad without running up and down the court. But when playing against a motivated defense (particularly if there's a dribble limit and time limit per possession), it can be a serious grind that I imagine most NBA players would rather not repeatedly submit themselves to during the All-Star Break.   Moreover, generally speaking, watching 1-on-1 isn't nearly as exciting as it generally seems in our thoughts. The most competitive 1-on-1's are grind-it-out affairs with lots of contested layups &amp; jumpshots, unchallenged defensive rebounds, and resets. It's generally slow and ugly.   Lastly, I imagine it'd be tough to ever find enough worthwhile competitors who'd be willing to put their perceived reputation on the line. Not to mention, enough guys already coast their way through All-Star festivities. I imagine a 1-on-1 could just as well end up as a casual, lazy affair so whoever loses can claim they weren't going all-out, with a random like Torrey Craig winning because he's one of the few actually going all out.   [Here's what the NBA's 1-on-1 contest used to look like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9WhHFhLus&amp;ab_channel=ginoongkamote)"
"Murray is great but they lost Jerami Grant, Plumlee and Torrey Craig.  Murray played at an all-time level of greatness in the playoffs last year and they still barely beat the Jazz by a buzzer beater.  Grant/Craig/Plumlee leave big holes in their roster that Murray+Jokic going super saiyan again isn't enough to fill, they need other guys to step up.  Fortunately they have 60% of a season to figure out their chemistry issues so I'm not counting them out yet."
"Nuggets lost Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig, three of their best bench defensive pieces. That'll hurt you."
LMFAOOOOO  &amp;#x200B;  that's that no Gary Harris no Jerami Grant or Torrey Craig defense... this front office is doing a great job
"lmao jokic's team would not give up 170, g leaguers are not necessarily bad defenders... you can just surround him with a bunch of 3-and-D guys or cutters or whatever (like Torrey Craig) and they'd still be a good offense because of his offensive impact and passing. That's why the Nuggets have a top offense every year even with basically defense-only starters like Millsap and Harris getting a ton of minutes.  The Lakers defense is literally worse with AD on the court: https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/816/onoff#tab-team_efficiency, for both opponent eFG% and points/possession, and has been for both seasons he's been there.  He has the 2nd worst defensive rating on the team this season, only better than Schroeder: https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747   The Lakers are Lebron's team and when Lebron was out of the game against us we went off. The dude is extremely overrated, he has nuts talent but no leadership ability and no track record for lifting up his teammates in a meaningful way"
"In this alternate universe we probably have the roster spots to keep Craig  But yes, I miss Torrey too"
"The thing that people don't realize is that most of the bench is new. Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig were all rotational players who left in the offseason. Integrating new players, injuries, and trying to get Michael Porter, Jr. to understand the NBA game is why the team is underperforming."
"Yeah, it's semi-pro but a lot of imports come down. For anyone reading, the best/most high profile players to sign for an NZNBL team are Torrey Craig (pre-NBA) and DeAndre Liggins (COVID messed that up tho)."
"For you, maybe  For Torrey Craig, it is \*checks notes\* Friday"
Torrey Craig
"i'd say it's worse tbh   barton, 13/3@50%TS over the last 3 years, after being booed off the court by the home crowd in the playoffs, was given his starting job back over 2 players that are now MIP frontrunners in first full year on another team   sold beasley for pennies on the dollar, grant left for nothing, they let their only backup big go  without replacement, didn't replace torrey craig either, their only 4s are bench level players   they traded a 1st to dump nurkic, another 1st to dump faried, and yet another was given up for grant - 3 1sts for literally negative return"
"Nuggets fan here:   We lost Jeremi grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig- which was almost our entire bench unit. Jeremi would come to be a starter and then we’d pull Millsap off the bench, but yeah, our team didn’t get better. Isaiah Hartenstein was signed to replace plumlee but has not been playing well and he’s the only other center on our roster besides Jokic.  Combine that with nagging injuries to Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, and now even PJ Dozier. Our team is being forced to play 3rd string players significant minutes and play our remaining starters too many minutes.   We’ve even attempted small ball (maybe even considered “micro ball”) lineups, with 4 small guards and Jamykel Green at center, who are always outmatched and cannot make up for their size.   The off-season was not kind to us and even though I believe we could still make a splash in the playoffs with reduced rotation, we’re going to have trouble getting a good spot with a healthy bunch at this rate."
digiorno has been great game every game i've seen  who needs a cheap low usage wing defender like torrey craig though
"dang what a fun game to watch as a bucks fan.  love seeing torrey craig playing good on both ends, bobby always is consistent, donte's defense was clutch, middleton smooth af, and it was nice to see that giannis middleton chemistry at the end to seal the game with that lob."
Offensive monster Torrey Craig outscored him tonight.
how has Torrey Craig played for you guys this year?
"When Torrey Craig his hitting off the dribble pull ups, it’s just one of those games"
Torrey Craig revenge game
Torrey Craig needs to step up against Murray
TIL Torrey Craig is on the suns now
Torrey Craig
"Dario Saric, Torrey Craig, Abdel Nader."
"The Suns are still a playoff team with Rubio instead of CP3. James Jones contracted a deep and balanced team by getting Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, Cam Payne and Torrey Craig. Plus James Jones traded for CP3. CP3 is the difference between being around the 6/7 seed and being the 1/2 seed, but James Jones built this roster and hired Monty Williams. He deserves credit for what he's done, saying CP3 is the only reason for the Suns improvement is ignorant"
"Ayton loves playing Jokic as well. No more Gary Harris or Torrey Craig to harass Book either.  So far the season series has gone like this:  Suns win the first one in a game where CP3 was clutch in the fourth. Nuggets were without MPJ, due to covid I think. Suns were playing on the second night of a b2b, the first game was in Utah and the second in Denver.. probably the most difficult b2b there is.   Second game went to OT. Booker got hurt late in  OT while the Suns were winning, Denver ended up closing it out in a really fun back and forth game.   Third game was the very next night. Without Booker the Suns lost in double OT. Ayton was having a good game but fouled out in the first OT. Jamal Murray controversially traveled on the shot that sent the game to OT, so a lot of fans feel like this one was stolen. The Suns blew a pretty good lead in this one though so you can’t blame it all on the no call."
"Nuggz fans were missing Gary Harris in the playoffs last year, but it was clear to me Torrey Craig had a bigger impact on Don than Harris usually did. He's so strong and athletic enough Don can't get to his position on him. I actually didn't see how often he was defending Don, but your boys brought the defense 1-5 tonight."
"Yup. Of course adding CP3 was huge, but James Jones hiring Monty Williams, acquiring Cam Johnson and Dario Saric, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig etc. Has given this team amazing depth and experience. This team can make a playoff run because of that"
We love Torrey Craig here in Phoenix. No idea how we got him for cash
"Torrey Craig waited until Mitchell had the ball and then grabbed Mitchell before he had turned and entered his shooting motion. This is the correct call, though I'm sure I'll get yelled at because I'm a fan of the benefitting team."
"somehow Torrey Craig is finishing games for Phoenix now lmfao, this dude cant lose"
Ballsy move by Torrey Craig
He reminds me of Torrey craig does everything and plays great defense
Get Torrey Craig for cash was awesome too. So was signing Langston galloway for a minimum. So was getting Nader in the CP3 trade.
I don't know about the others but Luka will eat Torrey Craig for lunch
"Mikal, Crowder, Torrey Craig, Cam Johnson. We have a ton of guys to throw at him and that’s why we have been successful against the Mavs."
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
Torrey Craig was sacrificed for this.
Torrey Craig is Fantastic
"Grant, Harris, and Craig were all negative players for the Nuggets last year.    Grant was one of the least productive Nuggets not only through the bubble but everything outside of the clippers series. He showed up for the Nuggets for just over one week and was a negative player who produced below replacement level the rest of his time with the team.   Harris and Craig were big negatives all year.   Morris and Campazzo are both better than Harris on both offense and defense. PJ Dozier is literally just a slightly more effecient Torrey Craig with even better defense. MPJ went from a replacement level bench player to one of the most effecient 20/10 bigs in the league.   Keep sleepin'."
"Probably Cameron Payne and Torrey Craig. Suns have a decent 9-man rotation, their 10th man is where the next tier down begins."
"Tbh he hasn't even been that cheap lately though. As much as it pains me to defend Sarver, the guy promised a few years back to try to change and fix the issues the fanbase had with him, and he's done a very good job so far. He invested a decent chunk of his own money into the Suns sick new high tech arena and training facilities(even though he probably could have got the tax money to pay all of it since the Suns don't technically own the arena). He paid and locked up Book long term. He paid quite a few head coaches guaranteed money yet didn't settle on keeping a mediocre one just to keep costs down(he kept hiring new ones over and over until we got a great one in Monty).   He fired the entire front office and GM and pretty much started the entire thing over from scratch(who have been impressive so far, especially James Jones). He's also been staying out of basketball related situations as far as we know like he promised, haven't heard of any drama or weird things involving him with the team or basketball decisions in a while. And on top of all that he literally just agreed to send the Suns all time MVP Cash $. Considerations for Torrey Craig which is already proving to be a steal.  That said of course I'm never going to forget the many mistakes he made. But there's no reason to shit on the guy right now with the way he's changed lately, at least until he gives me a new reason. Especially with the Suns contending now as well. One thing's for sure there is 0 reason for the media to still be shitting on him or the Suns rn and making fake Book trades to the Knicks, who have an owner whos historically arguably just as bad as Sarver and have a worse supporting cast especially after sending half their roster for Book. It made sense 2 years ago when we were bad, but not now. It's just proof that the media has an agenda to make the Knicks a destination/superteam because all they will have to do is farm Knicks related articles+videos and it will be clicks/views by the millions and EZ money."
we don't accept Torrey Craig slander here
"Torrey ""Sweaty Head"" Craig"
"Can’t believe we got Torrey Craig for free lmao. He’s been so good, how did he not find a role in Milwaukee?"
Honestly if fucking Torrey Craig threw me a sweaty headband I would throw that shit back. Now if Lebron or Curry did that 😈😈😈 I would be making bank off their sweat
"I'm so happy Nets got LMA and Blake instead of an All-Time Great Torrey Craig.   Also, Hawks fans, is Young slower then last year? He hasn't been able to beat people off the dribble, looks weird."
Since you gave away TJ Warren for free  And got Torrey Craig for free  Does the associative property apply here so we can say you traded TJ Warren for Torrey Craig? Does it work like that?
"Now that’s a 4th quarter for ya ass!! We got away with some poor defense, but as soon as Crowder muscled that rebound out of Capelas hands I knew we were going to win.   That Mikal dunk late in the 4th made me jump out my seat. Seeing all of the clutch buckets come from him, Crowder, and DA was reassuring.   I’m glad Dario bounced back tonight.   Torrey Craig is a baller, and way bigger than I realized.   I’d be very interested to see Cam Johnson’s stats pre and post covid.   Galloway is probably going to see all his minutes go to Nader."
We got Torrey Craig for free lmao
The Malone Special. Same shit with Torrey Craig in the past. Always closing the game out with someone who doesn’t belong on the court at the end of the game.
He's like Torrey Craig but if Torrey Craig thought he were Kobe.
"Good lord with the assumptions here, and I'm a fellow Nuggets fan! Jesus man..   I would contend we traded for Gordon because he's way, way better at guarding multiple positions and especially bigger wings and athletic 4s while being a body type/athlete we didn't previously have, and he's a much better offensive player than Dozier as well. This does not mean Dozier is incapable of guarding 3s competently. He spent time on Brandon Ingram both Pelis games and did mostly ok on him for instance, and he's done well against other 3s too. The issue is he's not a very good offensive player, and he's not big enough to guard guys like LeBron and that ilk, and even if he was - you wouldnt want him playing more than 20 minutes a night. You can't have just one guy though who can guard some 3s in limited minutes and be successful. And of course Gordon is a huge upgrade over him guarding 3s, while being a huge upgrade over Millsap/JMG guarding athletic 4s at the same time.   I'm just going to go back to what was supposed to be my main point earlier, saying we don't miss Torrey Craig at all and PJ Dozier is probably a better player than TC3."
"Because the alternative was PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.   We paid him 20mil to be a below average starter.  He was one small part of that team. He did not will them single handedly, that's honestly laughable to suggest."
"Yeah, based on him going to Detroit for the same money, and his comments,  I wonder if he didn't want to be there in Denver.  I thought he was fine, but not elite.. people were excited about him defending LeBron in the playoffs and such but like, who else did the Nuggets even have? Torrey Craig? Gordon fills that role and is going to be better at it."
"Yep, Garry Harris and Torrey Craig killed us in the playoffs last year. I’m still scared of Jokic but the Nuggets are not as good of a matchup against us this year"
"Yeah exactly, he has shown this behavior before just wasn't consistent. Same thing you're saying about Mitchell. But both have done it before.  Saying out of the blue is like if torrey craig just started dropping 50s on y'all"
No wonder the Bucks bailed on Torrey Craig.   Thanos is a legit NBA contributor
"Shit, forgot about him. Umm it still probably isn’t that big of a disparity between the two teams when we have CP3, Crowder, Dario, Torrey Craig has like 30 games of playoff experience, goddamn Cameron Payne has probably been in the playoffs with the Thunder."
Jerami grant and Torrey Craig were guarding him. Both good defenders
Torrey Craig
"Zero emotion. I miss Torrey Craig, but Dozier has more upside and settling in as a good defender. Can't wait till he goes to a horrible team in two years and drops 20+/game that seems to happen."
"I think Giannis to Nuggets would be better in the long term with larger group of young prospects. Jokic to Bucks would allow them to have such a different approach in half court offense which could help them get over the hump in the championship race right now. I think with the team identity of the nuggets I feel like Giannis might struggle to hit 20-30 points a night as he wouldn’t be the focus of the offense at the top of the key since Jokic or Murray would bring the ball up and start their two man game. I would be worried he would only be used as a cutter and defender, almost like an oversized two time mvp award winning version of Torrey Craig."
"I didn’t insult him because he disagreed. I said it because it was clear he didn’t read. It was very obvious that I said he shouldn’t win EOY and then the guy got upset and started talking about top 5  Also no,that’s not all. He had trade away the 2nd most popular guy on the team for that trade and take on 40 million in cap. He also signed Crowder, Saric, Kaminsky, Galloway, Moore, and traded for Torrey Craig."
Abdel Nader gave the Suns good minutes this year. Was a short stint as we rotate in and out our bench players and he got hurt right when we got Torrey Craig who quickly stole his spot
"That was a mental series, and Torrey Craig is such a good fit on the Suns!"
Get melo and torrey craig out this game
Future hall of famer Torrey Craig
Swear Torrey Craig just looks like a hooper. The arm/leg sleeve and the headband just fit him so well. Elite basketball drip.
That was a pretty bad 2 minutes of Melo and 2 very good minutes from Torrey Craig
Torrey Craig putting the Suns on his back.
Hahaha that would be great! Finals MVP Torrey Craig.
Torrey craig
"I was begging for it for a lot of the season. Maybe there was a reason I'm unaware of, but it boggles my mind how he wasn't signed anywhere. He's 31, and he isn't going to come in and save your franchise, but he damn sure can fill in off the bench as he's showing in Miami. He can rebound, I think I remember him being alright from three for his size, and can play that harder, more physical game that we can't because our backup bigs are Saric and Kaminsky.  So instead of that or someone else at the deadline, we paid the Bucks about $13 for Torrey Craig (who has been great for us, I'm a fan of the pickup, but he unfortunately isn't seven feet tall)."
Torrey Craig is an absolutely awful matchup with AD. I would try Ayton on AD and let Frank or Dario check Gasol/Drummond
Slap Torrey Craig on em lmao
yeah Torrey Craig is not guarding AD lol
I’m not a big Frank the tank guy but this might be the kind of matchup you start him over Torrey Craig
"Also Torrey Craig, he’s been a great pickup for us and is a great combo of the length and speed of mikal with a little more size like Jae"
"It was Torrey Craig. But yeah, I still get triggered thinking about it lol"
"Torrey Craig was waived by the Bucks and now is a rotational player for the Suns! In fact, he started one game a couple of days ago, he gives a lot of hustle."
Cam Payne was out of the league. Now he’s our best bench player one year later. Torrey Craig got no minutes for the bucks. We got him for cash and now he’s started 7 games and plays decent minutes for us.
"Jae Crowder played in the finals last year, and Torrey Craig went to the conference finals."
X_X  Cameron Payne and Torrey Craig killing us a 2nd straight game
I know this is a Cam thread but I am still baffled how we got Torrey Craig for a bag of chips. This guy plays mega defense and can hit a shot every once in while. This must be why they are calling for Bud's job in Milwaukee.
Chippy game and the energy in there was off the charts tonight. God Damn Phoenix has been starving for playoff level ball for so long. Great game ps Torrey Craig was robbed of that wicked dunk
Torrey Craig is a baller.
"We were able to flip Cash Considerations for Torrey Craig as well, which is working for us"
Bet you never imagined this when trading Beasley and letting Torrey Craig walk :/
"Chris Paul   Devin Booker     Mikal Bridges   Torrey Craig   Deandre Ayton   Yes, I just listed the Suns starting 5"
"nah you're forgetting the new guy, torrey craig! mans can dunk"
torrey craig fits so nicely
I don’t even know If PHX is a top 8 team without CP3.  If they have Rubio back they are probably 9th by a good margin below Memphis and Golden State.  Chris Paul makes everyone better who is a dependent player like Bridges and Crowder and Torrey Craig.  That’s how he can elevate a team.  Booker will be Booker but the others needed CP3s playmaking and his defensive discipline and leadership.  He’s a real MVP candidate this year depending on how Denver and Philly finish the season.
All the kevetching about us letting Torrey go while PJ was hurt with the hammy...  I told you all he way substantially better than Craig.
Don’t forget about Torrey Craig

"OKC, I don’t know shit about your coach, but damn did your guys play hard after what they went through last game. I’m very happy we pulled out that win. Also, Torrey Fucking Craig"
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
I love Torrey Craig but it is pretty generous to give him the '3' label. He can D a specific type of large guard...and know that he is supposed to be low usage. That shot can get ugly at times.
"Kleber, ingles, tobias, and batum at his age are all terrible defenders cmon bro  List also needs torrey craig, jaymichael green, mikal bridges, bacon"
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
"And don't forget about torrey Craig and Cam Johnson, who are both amazing bench wings to have.  Saric and Kaminsky have also both had really solid stretches"
"Assuming Jae crowder gets healthy, I really think we won’t go under 9 players. We will have to play saric as backup 5, cam Payne, cam Johnson, and Torrey Craig have been too good not to play. I think that’s our core."
Suns have two on this list (Bridges and Crowder) and two more who I think most people would characterize as 3+D guys or close to it (Torrey Craig and Cam Johnson). The Phoenix 3-4 rotation is pretty loaded with this archetype.
"They don't necessarily have to if they cost under a third of his price, Torrey Craig might straight up be a better basketball player right now and he costs the league minimum. Crowder isn't as good as Mikal overall but he's a reasonable facsimile and he can guard bigger players, like Craig can."
I’m glad someone else feels this way. There has been multiple games where mikal got outplayed by Torrey Craig and cam Johnson so I feel like he’s not as important as some fans think. Meanwhile if ayton were to miss time his impact would be noticed because there is nobody else on the roster that can do what he does.
Gary Harris x Torrey Craig hybrid
"Yeah, we added Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Torrey Craig on top of not losing Ayton.  Add Crowder/Craig/Payne/Ayton to any team and they improve a ton.  Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson are playing amazing this year as they have another year under their belt.  I'm not saying Paul isn't making us better, he obviously is, but people acting like he is the sole reason why we are good this year are ignorant at best.  Incredibly young team.  If we just ran it back, we are probably around 5th or 6th this year in the west."
Torrey Craig has been huge man. Rolling him out next to crowder for guys like lebron/ad/kawhi feels good. They may not be the tallest but those guys are jacked.
"Yeah the Suns definitely made the right moves this last off season. Also, Torrey Craig sucked, Thanasis straight up was out playing him and I didn't think I would ever see Thanasis out playing anyone."
"I think that the Bubble Suns were unsustainable, considering we had bench guys shooting incredibly well. But then we took that team (that would have made the playoffs if DA doesn’t get suspended) and traded some guys for players who can be be good consistently, like CP3 and Crowder. And then the Bucks gave us Torrey Craig for free for some reason"
Torrey Craig is 110% hustle.
"Not with michael malone, we had torrey craig start playoff games, rn we have shaq harrison getting solid minutes , facundo campazzo is becoming the face of the franchise all thru hustle, if you give him everything you got as a player moach will reward you with playing time"
"&gt;But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys.  ?? Yes it does, this whole conversation is about how you are worse after losing those guys. Other teams have been able to replace guys who leave easier.  I don't blame you for trading for Kemba - at least that was an attempt to replace Kyrie, but you didn't replace Hayward, Horford, Morris, or Rozier with good enough players.  Contenders are able to find value in the bargain bin every year, don't give me the whole ""woe is me"" bullshit as if you didn't have options available. Covington was traded for a mid-round first. Horford himself was dumped for nothing. You could have moved Hayward last year before he jet set on you. Dwight Howard is a backup C on a contender, Torrey Craig is a rotation player for a contender, You didn't want to move for Aaron Gordon last year when you had 3 1st round picks for up grabs. Jordan Clarkson went to the Jazz for nothing. George Hill, Delon Wright basically moved for nothing but you went for shitty ass Jeff Teague instead.  Please don't act like there was no alternative. Ainge made some wrong moves in trusting goes, drafted the wrong people, etc and these are the consequences."
Barton is a great 5th option. We literally had Torrey Craig starting in the playoffs without Barton lol. He’s a huge upgrade. AG is a huge game changer because he lets MPJ play in his most comfortable position and AG is a better wing defender than Jeremi Grant. What have Phoenix and the Jazz shown that proved they’re better than Denver? Denver started slow after the short offseason with Jamal and Mpj both being hurt/missing time and were only a few games back with the best record in the league since we got AG.
"OP making this thread is one of the most blatant act of dumbness  Jokes aside, I like Torrey Craig, but I see nothing wrong with this move. He's barely a bench player, let him do and let the Bucks make their own decisions"
"Thanasis isn't that bad of a player tbh. And Torrey Craig didn't do much for them, though he's playing really well now"
Imagine keeping Torrey craig over giannis .  Do you hear yourself?
Yes the bucks won't win anything because they traded Torrey Craig
I’ve really liked Torrey Craig for a while. Glad he’s really starting to play well!!!
Some people theorize the front office was trying to encourage Malone to start MPJ. Torrey Craig was a bit of a crutch for Malone who tends to prefer defensive minded veterans over talented but green prospects.
The Suns trading the cash considerations they got from the TJ Warren trade to get Torrey Craig makes it sound better

"Torrey Craig is definitely more cheeks, don't get it twisted"
No not at all. Torrey Craig offers great defense on multiple positions while TT is unplayable in the playoffs
lol are u torrey craig bro?  this is weird.
No disrespect to Torrey Craig but he was literally traded for cash considerations

Quietly Torrey Craig has been playing big bench minutes for us even playing small ball 5 a few times and we got him for cash only
"Aggression aside, simply staying in front of your man to keep him from getting downhill is huge.  For example, Torrey Craig got lauded as a defensive guy even though he was honestly pretty medium. He gave a ton of effort so Malone loved him and played him a ton (see: facu). But he also gambled a ton and played really aggressively. When that isn’t really what we need with our defensive scheme. Gary Harris, on the other hand, was really great at just simply staying in front of his man (when he was healthy anyway). He didn’t take many risks but he also rarely made many mistakes.  Now perhaps simmons and thybulle get the best of both worlds with embiid behind them and they can opportunistically take some chances, but I think given the choice between:  * above average (or elite) perimeter defenders who can stay in front of their man with an average rim protector  vs   * average perimeter defenders with an above average (or elite) rim protector  I think I’d take the first one. Unfortunately for Denver, we have been struggling with having average at both lol. I think Philly is above average to elite at both. But I think I’d rather limit the penetration in the first place rather than try to deal with it at the rim where guys score pretty efficiently regardless of who is there.  Somewhat related question - who do you think is more impactful for your defense between simmons and embiid? Or are their roles too intertwined to really make a distinction? Who do you think is more talented in a vacuum? I’m genuinely asking our of curiosity, not because I’m trying to set up a “gotcha” or anything re: the DPOY or MVP, though I do think having two standout guys can sometimes hurt each other (like Steph and KD in the mvp race)."
this is what I’m talking about. your standards are so low that you think torrey craig is a valuable player... man is a worse version of thanasis
"Thanks for wasting Torrey Craig, btw. He's excellent off the bench."
Lol Torrey Craig what was that
torrey craig lol
"just abdel nader for us, but torrey craig pretty much absorbed his minutes and probably will keep them."
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"We literally bought Torrey Craig at the deadline.  When the TJ Warren trade happened, I was furious. I know Cash Considerations is one of the most famous journeymen ever, but I didn't think it was a good fit for the team. I'll tell you what though, he was a good sport, and was perfectly fine with the trade. Ultimately, Cash Considerations was great for us."
"Suns getting Torrey Craig for cash has ended up being the steal of the trade deadline imo, guy is giving us pretty amazing production and we got him for nothing"
Suns for Torrey Craig
Torrey Craig
"Torrey Craig, not Dario anymore."
"Technically, we're second in the west, and you left out Torrey Craig in the bench lineup.   That said, I'm taking Suns in 6."
It's nice to see Torrey Craig doing well after the Bucks dumped him.
Cam Payne has been such a good backup PG for us  Also thanks Bucks for Torrey Craig ✔️
"If Torrey Craig has a million fans, then I am one of them 👍🏾. If Torrey Craig has ten fans, then I am one of them 😜. If Torrey Craig has only one fan then that is me 🙈.

"Hoping Jimmy is okay, I’ve liked seeing the Heat get hot down the stretch. Hopefully they can make the East playoffs more interesting. He came back but with the tight schedule this last month and a half I hope it doesn’t linger on because he wasn’t moving all that well in the 4th.  Really proud of the way DA has played against the other top centers in the league, he outplayed  Bam in both matchups this year. He looked like the best player on the floor tonight outside of that god awful miss on the oop. That one had potential to be the best highlight of his career.   The bench really brought it on the second night of the b2b, have to give them almost all of the credit for this win. It’s really telling ghat Devin had a game that bad, and we still got the win. Torrey Craig has been a huge difference maker, I can’t believe Milwaukee couldn’t find minutes for him given he can guard 1-5 and even play some small ball 5 in a pinch.   Might be the first time Goran didn’t absolutely destroy us since joining the Heat. I’m thinking it might be the Chris Paul effect because Goran always struggled with that matchup when he was in Phoenix, Cam Paynes eyes were getting big whenever he saw Gogi guarding him too."
"suns are gonna fuck around and win the title and people are still gonna be like “eh idk if i trust them”   torrey craig has been solid for the suns, idk why the bucks just let him go essentially"
Why did the Bucks trade Torrey Craig? He’s been amazing for us.
Can we get Torrey Craig back? Plz
Torrey Craig reached out to me this morning and says he is irate.
Lebron isn’t representing players with this statement. He’s representing all star players that already got the bag.  You really think guys like Torrey Craig would agree with this
Kevin Huerter vs. Torrey Craig for the 2021 NBA championship
"Torrey Craig was a walking dumpster for us, but I guess you weren’t watching"
"Dame wasn’t resting or hiding on defense either, I’m pretty sure he asked to guard MPJ on game when he was going off. I’m not saying you’re guard rotation wasn’t bad but we played in the playoffs a couple year’s ago with Jamal and you even had Torrey Craig and Dame did fine"
And what the Suns did to get Torrey Craig 😏
"Doesn’t mean he’s garbage, but if all you want is defense you can get it for way cheaper than a max. not as good as Ben but you can get a Torrey Craig type for pennies on the dollar if you don’t need his playmaking"
"tbf, torrey craig should not be live streaming from inside the locker room.  anyone else remember when AB whipped up a shitstorm for the same thing"
"He hit Torrey Craig in the arm, not the head/neck."
"Absolutely nobody is giving Torrey Craig $10m a year, this isn’t 2016."
"Some people just refuse to give credit to the Suns for being a really good team. 2 all stars that can take over games in CP3 and Booker, a big man in Ayton that has all the talent to be elite and is showing off that talent in these playoffs, a forward in Bridges that is an elite defender that can hit threes and is great in transition, and then more awesome role players in Crowder, Cam Johnson/Payne, Torrey Craig. They gotta put some respect on this team"
Ngl the two things I remember the most in your guys series was the 4OT game and Jokic shoving Kanter into Torrey Craig who had fucked his nose up and then Denver trying to fight Kanter for it which was weird lol
Can't believe we gave up Torrey Craig for cash smh
TORREY CRAIG WITH THE GAME WINNING REBOUND
Torrey Craig quiet so far
Torrey Craig &gt; Aaron Gordon 😒
add Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig to the list while you are at it
"This is so bizarre. I thought I would read an insightful post about position normalcy and instead got a condescending Thunder fan who thinks the Suns would have a very low ceiling without Paul. I mean, sure, we would have been a lower seed in the playoffs, but we still would have made them pretty comfortably. He has rescued us in multiple games, both regular season and playoffs, not discounting his effect. But very low ceiling and no leadership? That's a joke.  Also, the team doesn't play completely classic. Dario Saric or even Torrey Craig at the five is a bit abnormal, but we run it depending on the other team. If we had the tools like a Ben Simmons or Jokic we would definitely run a far different offense and defense. However, even in the NBA guys like those are the outlier.  I have enjoyed watching CP3 run the offense, as I do love  great point guard play, and the rest of the team in more position-normal roles. But I don't think we run it as a matter of fitting into positions, but because it is the best use of what we have."
jae crowder and Torrey Craig who played in the Finals and WCF last year have been holding up just fine.
"Look at both videos... You will see Mikal running the baseline as an option for CP3 to pass to if Jokic or Mikals man tried to agressively defend CP3 since he beat Rivers to his spot (this happens a lot tbh, with Torrey Craig and Jae Crowder doing similar actions as well to give more options to Cp3) ...while like you said, Ayton is another option as the screener, in a traditional PnR, who could roll to the paint as well or pick and pop... If u dont have other cutters opening up options for CP3 aside from the original screener, a ""pretty basic PnR"" wont be as successful IMO... This is great execution, but a play that gives CP3 other options aside from Ayton if this was just a basic PnR."
Torrey Craig &gt; Aaron Gordon
Aaron Gordon is worse than Torrey Craig lol
"we got millsap locked down after JaMychal Green signed with us  i guess they determined that the remaining free agents wouldnt really do much for the team, but then again it's the same guys who determined torrey craig couldnt find a spot on the team either for some fuckin reason"
" Torrey ""Cash Considerations"" Craig"
why did the bucks even trade torrey craig?
is torrey craig the dude with the emoji tattoo? or am i a fucking idiot. i can’t remember who it is
imagine not finding roster space for torrey craig.. im glad he still found a spot in this league tho.
Why does Torrey Craig get so many minutes
Would Torrey Craig get a ring regardless?
Yes he's playing over Cam Payne. He's that good. He'd probably get minutes over Torrey Craig too in more 3 guard lineups.
They should have kept Torrey craig
"I think we would protect our starting 5, the two cams and Torrey Craig/saric. I don’t know which of the last 2"
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"CP3 step back 3, steal by Dar Dar Binks, lob from Cam Payne to Torrey Craig for the slam"
Bucks excuse is that they don't have Torrey Craig
Bucks excuse is that they don't have Torrey Craig
Bucks fan here: seeing Torrey Craig and Bogdan be successful in the playoff is Pain
That's not the only thing that changed.  They got killed by injuries last year.  They also basically swapped Baynes and Kelly Oubre for Jae Crowder and Torrey Craig.
"There was one play I recall, it was either toward the end of the half, or end of the third, where Phoenix took the ball up the court, Denver was not playing any defence really, a wide open shot was taken, missed, no denver player has moved much at all yet, and Torrey Craig comes flying down grabs the board and puts it up and in, no contest on the shooter, no box outside, no movement, I immediately thought of LeBron and the Lakers in the previous series against the suns when LeBron was just walking down the court"
"5 of the 8 remaining teams have never won a championship,, with all 4 of the West teams, and the Nets of the East, and the Nets being the heavy favorite to win the East (and the finals), assuming the big 3 stay healthy, It is fairly likely that a first time champion will be crowned, and after tonights performance, I believe that it will be the suns vs Nets in the 2021 nba finals, which is probably the best matchup for the Nets considering the suns have CP3, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig, who are all capable defenders, as well as Cam Payne, who isnt necessarily a great defender, but definitely a pest, and Ayton at the anchor, with Saric, who has shown he is a good defender who can stretch the floor, I think this team is the only team with enough defensive assets with the offensive fire power to challenge the Nets"
YOU'RE GETTING A TORREY CRAIG JERSEY
Did Torrey Craig change headbands?
I’ve been joking with my friends about getting a Torrey Craig jersey since the trade. Am I getting a Torrey Craig jersey?
The Suns paid $110K for Torrey Craig.  He could have beat the Nets by himself
Torrey Craig going beast mode against his former team.
Torrey Craig &gt; MPJ in my book
CP3 putting on a clinic out there.  And Torrey 'Cash Considerations' Craig was such an underrated pickup.
torrey craig gotta be the worst player ever to be getting playoff revenge games like this lmao
"“If I win, I want the money AND they respect” - Torrey craig"
I love Torrey Craig.
Torrey Craig revenge tour
Torrey Craig upset he lost the MVP to Jokic
it’s the torrey craig revenge series
Torrey Craig with the Michael Jordan circus layup lol
Bucks really have up Torrey Craig for cash considerations huh
"Torrey Craig, man. Must feel so good to pull that stuff off against his old team."
Torrey Craig was such a great pickup
Paul Craig should've just bought Torrey Craig's jersey
Torrey Craig
You can’t convince me that the bucks couldn’t use Torrey Craig right now.
Torrey Craig used to weirdly bother him too
I’m just happy for Torrey Craig. I love players who get to the league in non-traditional ways.
"The comparison above is not for the Nuggets. The Suns have Cam Payne, Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig."
It’s not iconic but the one [Torrey Craig had two nights ago](https://www.instagram.com/p/CP2F7gHs_oK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) was awesome
Those 'wilder' fans are fucking idiots. Same morons who shat on Torrey Craig the whole time he was there and now hes proved how good he is
"Suns bench:  Guards - Cam Payne (can start on any team), Etwan Moore (proven vet) Langston Galloway (Microwave scorer from downtown and proven starter), Jevon Carter (best defender among the guards and capable 3pt shooter), Tyshon Alexander (rookie, 3 pt sniper)  Forwards - Cam Johnson (has been a starter as well), Torrey Craig (Proven Vet and rebounder w a sweet 3pt stroke)  PF/C - Dario Saric (proven stretch big), Frank Kaminsky (also proven stretch big) - both of them are capable passers btw ; Jalen Smith (Rookie but can shoot the 3 and block shots/rebound)  Just looking at the Bench, we can field another starting 5 with Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric and still be able to defend and outscore another average NBA starting 5, and have capable backups in Galloway, Jevon Carter, and Frank Kaminsky to run vs other 2nd units...that's a DEEP bench right there...  I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come . Go SUNS!!!!"
"Idk, I think it’s a straight and hard foul but not dirty. This takedown isn’t going to cause injury (intent to hurt), isn’t being sneaky (like trying to get away with sticking your foot out), and isn’t really any type of play I’d define as dirty.  That said, it was not a basketball play in the slightest lmao. Torrey Craig is just like “Eyyo Ref lemme get you an optometrist because you’re fuckin blind missing this.”"
"What are you talking about? Torrey ""Cash Considerations"" Craig has been great for us."
That crowd reaction after the Torrey Craig oop was the loudest I think I've ever heard an NBA arena through the TV
"Maybe, but didn't the Suns get Torrey Craig for a soft serve machine and some Phoenix Open tickets?"
"Ideally CP3 opts out for a multi-year deal at less annually. We use the new space to lock down Payne and maybe Craig. If we can then get a backup 5 behind Ayton at a reasonable price, I think we're set to see what we can do for a few years. At that point our team looks like:  Guards of CP3, Book, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter on multi year deals  Forwards of Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Centers of Ayton, the hypothetical backup I talked about and Dario"
"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.   If the Suns win this series, I am 100% on the Suns bandwagon.  I’ve always been a huge fan of CP3, and Booker/Ayton are so much fun to watch. Plus Torrey Craig was one of my favorite Nuggets while he was here."
Torrey Cash Considerations Craig gets me so hype
"A Giannis-Middleton-Jrue core is still a great place to be ""stuck"". And just look at the teams remaining: Austin Rivers, Campazzo, Torrey Craig, Blake Griffin, Mike James, Jeff Green, etc. There are always vet min/buyout/overseas/etc. role players that can make in impact in the right system, and it's a lot easier to attract those guys when you have 3 All Star caliber players locked up"
Love the crowd shot of those kids going berserk after the Torrey Craig alley-opp 😆🤯🤩🤪
"Put some respecc on this considerable cash  - Torrey Craig, probably"
"Not to overreact, but the Phoenix Suns are winning the NBA Championship.  Memes aside and the classic r/nba overreaction comment hopefully avoided, I really do think they have a good chance, due to the thing I always look for in the playoffs -- a complete roster.  I love the way the Suns are built.   Point guard, 3&amp;D, elite scorer, big man.   If you evaluate rosters throughout the NBA based on the idea that those 4 player-archetypes round out a team, I just don't see anyone anywhere close to as complete as the Suns (the team they're playing in the Nuggets I'd argue is closest with a fully healthy roster).  I'm not saying other rosters aren't ""better"", obviously when you have the talent of the Clippers/Nets, and great teams like the Bucks (sadness) and Jazz.  But just looking at those categories, the Suns are insane:  * Point guard: The point god himself cp3, great backup option in Cam Payne  * Elite scorer: Booker. Enough said. Important that this role is fulfilled by someone that can create their own offense.  * 3&amp;D: Fucking loaded. Proven playoff 3D guy in Jae Crowder who makes all the teams he's been on better. Mikal Bridges and Torrey Craig are legit as fuck. Then a 6'8 Cam Johnson to maybe give a spark when the others don't have it. Four guys!  * Big guy: Ayton. #1 overall pick. Solid as fuck already at 22 years old. Lets the game come to him. Efficient, strong, good rebounder. Good feel around the rim and short range touch shots. Just a really good big man offensively and defensively. Maybe not as dominant/assertive as people would want, but come on.  Love rosters that are complete like this."
"Yep, I'm crying right now... with laughter.   Torrey Craig sends his regards."
^it ^was ^Torrey ^Craig ^but ^still ^really ^really ^awesome
Who let Torrey Craig go 😢  Damn management
Refs just let fucking Torrey Craig push Compazzo out of the way. Player touches Paul it's a foul.
we got Torrey Craig for nothing btw
"No joke, Torrey Craig might be my favorite Sun."
Torrey Craig revenge game
Gotta figure those kids going nuts is the happiest torrey craig has ever made someone at a basketball game who was not a member of his immediate family
"I'm alright losing this one, Phoenix is hype as shit rn.  But also Torrey Craig how could you"
Torrey Craig has Tim Duncan levels of facial impression.
torrey craig was on the nuggets last year right
torrey craig revenge series
The Torrey Craig Experience
torrey craig revenge series incoming?
Torrey Craig most underrated player in the league
I'd rather trade for Torrey Craig
"Fair. Our roster has been tweaked too, albeit not quite to the caliber of adding someone like AG. When we last played you guys, Cam Johnson was starting, I believe (Crowder starts now), and Torrey Craig has been solid for us."
"I would imagine that Monty will be relying on Torrey Craig/Jae Crowder quite a bit to defend Jokic if DA is resting, otherwise I’m sure DA is going to have to match Joker’s minutes as closely as possible"
"Yeah, we might have to try him or Torrey Craig on him if ayton gets in foul trouble but that scares me lol. Da is usually pretty good at staying out of foul trouble so I'm hopeful he'll be able to match jokic's minutes as much as possible"
Cameron Johnson  ❌  Frank Kaminsky ❌  Cameron Payne ❌  Dario Saric ❌  Torrey Craig ❌  Jevon Carter ❌  After those guys I'll consider Kuzma
Any Nuggets fan knows Torrey Craig does not suck. Wtf?
And Torrey Craig lol
Torrey Craig
"God forbid I point out that we lost our only true backup big man in a series where the opponent's best player is a 6'11 Greek Adonis, forcing us to play either Frank Kaminsky or go super small with Cam Johnson or Torrey Craig at the 5. What a ridiculous notion."
Torrey Craig is pretty good
Why the Torrey Craig hate though
"The only thing I disagree with you on is your edit at the end that says it'd be nice for CP3 to get a ring before he retires.  Fuck that. CP3 has long been the [dirtiest player](https://youtu.be/i9SUoe9Tzi0) in the NBA. [Everyone knows this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7i62HLZSlc). It's [well-documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMNXFXVyYrE). He's a [world-class flopper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDUewrU9Yw). Someone once made a [fake trailer with Chris Paul playing the protagonist Cock Puncher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM-6WmQNncs). Damn near [everyone HATES Chris Paul](https://youtu.be/6xQpd3C5fxE).  He deserves to be Icarus, flying too close to the sun and burning his wings at the worst possible time.  DeAndre Ayton, Monty Williams, Mikal Bridges, Cam Payne, Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig all seem to be perfectly good dudes. I'd be genuinely happy for them if they pulled it off and won the title.  But Chris Paul? Fuck Chris Paul. That dirty cock-punching flopper deserves no championship."
"Cam Johnson, Deandre Ayton, Cam Payne, mikal bridges. some of the most likeable guys in the league. Look at cash considerations Torrey Craig and Cam Payne fighting his way back from China and the G league. DA growing up in the Bahamas then moving to AZ for high school, stays at the university of Arizona. Drafted #1 by the suns. Great story, great player, great fans. Go Suns"
"I don't really get Booker's minute management, he sat 6 full minutes as the Bucks cut the lead in half early in the second quarter. I get that you need to spot him some minutes of rest but there's other ways to do it. Popovich once said that he'd rest guys for a minute or two and then call a TO so they'd have a solid 4 minutes of actual rest, or he'd sub out TP/TD/Manu with a minute left in a quarter for that extra solid minute of rest. It seems like the Suns coaching staff isn't really making any good use of minute management for Booker and CP3.    Anyhow, onto the rest of the game.   Torrey Craig and Crowder took some bad semi-contested, early in the 24 trey's to start the 2nd and that gave the Bucks a lot of momentum. I think there wasn't a lot the Suns could do defensively when Jrue and Khris are knocking down shots like that but I do think that the Suns are getting too stagnant on offense. CP3 didn't really take control of the Suns offense when Booker sat and they've become overly reliant on the Booker/Ayton high PnR. They run it well but they fail to hit up Ayton enough on the switch to truly punish the Bucks in the paint and their ball movement isn't good enough to get consistent open looks for Bridges/Cam/Crowder.    The Bucks role players also continue to step up and that's also a big difference compared to Phoenix' bench. Cam Payne has had minimal impact and Cam barely gets any shots, even though he's shooting what feels like 160% on his jumpers.    Phoenix is going to need a monster game out of Booker **and** CP3 in game 6, the Bucks are so incredibly tough at home that it feels like they need atleast 30+ from both."
Booker shot a worse FG% than everyone on his team except Torrey Craig. Elite volume scorer.
I like Ayton and Torrey Craig but that's it lol
I think having him available would help on the boards/help with foul trouble and he still definitely is less of a small ball 5 than Torrey Craig or Jae Crowder.
"I didn't look at all the Bucks offensive rebounds from Game 4, but of those I saw, I saw many cases of the Suns just not boxing out well enough or understanding rebounding angles well enough.  Heck, there was one time in the 2nd qtr that Torrey Craig had an UNBOTHERED offensive rebounding opportunity near the free throw line that bounced off his hand and went the Bucks way for an easy bucket.  These little matters of diligence costed them 1 or 2 games this series, and it may mean they lose the title."
CONGRATS TORREY CRAIG!!
PS: 5  Giannis Antetokumpo FGs Made: 5  Giannis Anteokumpo Free Throw Attempts: 5  Bobby Portis FG Attempts: 5  Pat Connaughton FG Attempts: 5  Pat Connaughton 3 Pointer Attempts: 5  Bucks Offensive Rebounds: 5  Jae Crowder +/-: -5  Mikal Bridges Points: 5  DeAndre Ayton FG Attempts: 5  Torrey Craig Minutes: 5  Cameron Payne +/-: -5  Suns Offensive Rebounds: 5  Suns Steals: 5
Bucks are fucked if Torrey Craig is hitting shots
I wonder what it would be like to have a Torrey Craig on the team and actually play him 🤔
Cash considerations can be anything. It can even be a Torrey Craig
Torrey Craig playing better than cash considerations. Think the suns won that trade
"I fucking love Monty, DA, and Mikal. Torrey Craig is one of my new loves, too.  Book is a fucking great guy too, even though I know he gets on a lot of people's nerves on the court. He does so much for the community and is a huge advocate for kids on the spectrum.  CP3 is also a pretty standup guy though I know he certainly also irks people on the court also, but he does a lot of excellent charity work whether it be gathering events where all proceeds go to charity, his involvement with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across America, build courts throughout poorer parts of New Orleans, and recently working towards the Social Change foundation to tear down discriminatory barriers.  I love this team. It's a longshot from our recent years between Josh Jackson and the Morris brothers."
Cries in Torrey Craig
"Well yea Torrey Craig is the 3rd off the bench. I'm pretty sure if you ask Chris Paul, or Booker you might get a different answer."
I mean if Torrey Craig was playing 40 min a game he might think about it a little differently
"No, the player should get ejected for the whole series    Now the sun starting lineup will look like ayton, Abdul nader, Torrey Craig , Frank, mykal"
"I forgot about Dozier completely, I guess that's why they had to go after Rivers.  I feel like Barton has always been out and they're use to playing without him. But agreed they were definitely short handed.   I was pretty surprised they got by without a 3 and D wing. They lost Gary Harris , Torrey Craig, and Jerami Grant! I've never considered Aaron Gordon to be a 3 and D wing but he did a good job on defense in the playoffs."
I just want Torrey Craig to get a ring
Torrey Craig on the far left looking like he’s trying to help Ayton with some Jedi shit.
"Very important role, even if its 15-20 min, or even less. The Suns are able to rest Ayton and run a decent small-ball 5-out offense. Montry tried to use Kaminsky, but he was garbage, so they ran Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig at the 4 and 5 and it was working."
"And I saw this exact play called as a blocking foul few times this playoffs, including one when Giannis murdered Torrey Craig"
"I don't think the Suns have the size to deal with these Bucks with Dario out. Jae or DA are going to get until foul trouble every game and beyond those 2 we have no one with any strength. Torrey Craig is fine in spurts, but won't cut it"
How the fuck did the Suns get Torrey Craig for cash considerations. He's been awesome off the bench.
Torrey Craig is who Pat Bev wants to be
Torrey Craig is getting his ass beat this series lmao
Giannis vs Torrey Craig? Nah give it to BP for a contested jumper
Pat is a rotation level 3 and D wing. There are less of those in the league than people think. Almost every team plays a non starter level 3 and d guard/wing in their rotation because they can provide some value on both ends.  Phoenix - Torrey Craig/Nader  Milwaukee - Connaughton/Tucker  Atlanta - Hill/Reddish  76ers -Thybulle  Clippers - Mann/Batum  There’s just less wings in general than people think and they are harder to exploit than a talented undersized guard or an athletic center who can’t shoot
Like when he ran into Torrey Craig and TC legit died. Didn't even flop. Ended up ten feet away from where his feet were planted.
Have Ayton play 40 a night and give the rest to Torrey Craig at the 5
"As good as a player he is, it seems really difficult to manage our guard rotation. He would have had to come off the bench and share minutes with the Cam's and Torrey Craig. Jevon Carter would probably get no minutes either. I think Jones picked Smith knowing our frontcourt depth is pretty shallow"
... and here we were giving Horst a lot of credit when it was really Giannis all along!  *(sweeps the D.J. Augustin signing and Torrey Craig trade under the rug)*
"Torrey Craig isn’t a big, he’s 6’7”"
Isn't it just Saric that's injured? Torrey Craig was back and playing this game.
Lmao gtfo here with that shit Giannis literally trucked over Jae Crowder and Jae got called for a foul. Giannis is SPOILED ROTTEN by the refs. All he does is play physical and crash into others and get away with a level of physicality that nobody else gets away with in this era but him. Look at the way he lowered his shoulder and tackled Torrey Craig the other day to the point where TC had to be carried off the court. There were Bucks fans saying even THAT wasn't an offensive foul lmao. That's how spoiled you guys are.   Dude is at the point where he has no regard for crashing into others and risking injury of others or himself because he knows he's going to get the benefit of the whistle 90% of the time and that physicality he gets away with is his bread and butter. Without it he's infinitely more guardable. But how can anyone be expected to guard someone that big and that athletic if he's allowed to bully you physically and you can't be physical back at all?  And it's probably going to be what leads to his downfall. He may be a freak of nature but he's not invincible. Don't be surprised if he gets injured bad some day on one of these reckless plays.
Saric was a non-contact hop step and Torrey Craig isn’t hurt.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wca758xZyGk  Torrey Craig foul. Routine drive to the basket. Lowers his shoulder, done by just about every NBA player. Correct offensive foul. Hard fall, Giannis just too strong. Play on.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gFV9PJCDco  Cam Johnson is holding Giannis, and Giannis is holding Cam Johnson. Battle for position. Cam Johnson initiates the contact my hooking Giannis' arm.   All of the evidence is captured in 4k and I'd be happy to provide still images for you."
"If he isn’t tackling or being overly aggressive, then explain how he has injured both Torrey Craig and Cam Johnson in this NBA Finals?"
Notice Ayton missing from this sequence? He got called for 3 fouls over a 4 minute stretch around halftime. Turns out Torrey Craig is a dropoff
Yeah Ayton suspiciously being called for 3 fouls over a 4 minute stretch around halftime. Turns out Torrey Craig and Frank Kaminski is a dropoff
Yeah Ayton suspiciously being called for 3 fouls over a 4 minute stretch around halftime. Turns out Torrey Craig and Frank Kaminski is a dropoff
My bad in thinking of Torrey Craig https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/7/4/22562610/torrey-craig-2021-nba-finals-ring-bucks-vs-suns
I thought Giannis and Torrey Craig both looked like they tore their ACL after they went down. Good to see them both playing.
This is how the game is fixed. Quick fouls no one pays attention to that change coaching decisions. Easy for Giannis to play well when he’s going at frank Kaminsky and Torrey Craig.... Wish we got to see him have to play Embiid and the Sixers defense.
Some of them already tried to say he was dirty for running over Torrey Craig
Man fuck the announcer for making it seem like giannis did something dirty there.     He’s a physical player and it’s a physical sport. That was shitty to see but clearly a clean basketball play. Kind of like the Torrey Craig thing. They’re demonizing him for being a physical player.
Still surprised that no tech called with Bobby portis banging his shoulder back on Torrey Craig after the foul
I like that Torrey Craig ring scenario:   Would you still take the ring if they beat you for it?
 Torrey craig hustling
Torrey Craig is leading the finals in falls
"Dario hurt, cp3 hurt, Booker hurt, Torrey Craig hurt."
Good vibes only for Torrey Craig
"Suns F Torrey Craig is indeed planning to play in Game 3, sources tell ESPN. He left Game 2 after tweaking that knee, but MRI was clean and he’s going to give it a go tonight."
Disagree. Torrey Craig is definitely in the convo
"What was the second one? I thought the Chris Paul one was a pretty obvious charge, but my memory's gone on any other charge/block calls other than the Torrey Craig one."
Few more:  Eric Gordon/Cam Payne   Trevor Ariza/Torrey Craig  Gerald Green/Cam Johnson (kinda)  Ryan Anderson/Dario Saric
"Giannis said ""for science"" and Torrey Craig got a freaking greek A380 in the face"
"Nader was the Celtics' bench player darling long before he got to Phoenix, we know all about him.  He doesn't have as much length or strength as Torrey Craig, and since the Bucks are huge all around, that's more important for this match-up."
Torrey 'Not Surfside Condos' Craig
"Fun fact about Torrey Craig: On the NBA app, he’s pictured in front of a Suns logo in a Milwaukee jersey. My sources tell me this means he most likely used to play for the Bucks, but now plays for Phoenix. More info coming up."
"Torrey ""no structural damage"" Craig"
This is awesome. Torrey Craig is a beast and I was really excited to see him show out in the finals.
Torrey ‘Giannis Genes’ Craig
"Booker had demoralizing threes to kill the Bucks comebacks, and there were also a few truly unbelievable foul calls on the Bucks that killed their comeback momentum too. Flat out, the Suns played a great game. And the Bucks played well too, with the exception of Middleton not being his normal self on offense. As everyone says with finals games, the margin of error is tiny and every error is significant. Bad calls in a finals are momentum killers and do have a significant effect on the game. And I’d have to look it up (I know it’s a cop out to bitch about bad calls w/o mentioning them specifically) but I remember three egregious “wtf” fouls. One of them was when Jrue “pushed” Booker in the second quarter and got his second foul, got taken out of the game, and the Suns went on an immediate 7-0 run. That’s a significant wtf foul call.  Another one (while this wasn’t a momentum changer) was Torrey Craig blocking Giannis but getting the charging call. Unfortunately Craig got injured on that play but that was so clearly not a charge — Craig was moving.  I feel like the big one I’m forgetting was against Connaughton in the third quarter. Or Lopez.   Chris Paul standing behind Giannis and blindsiding him to try to get a foul call was so fucking slimy — that’s just gonna get guys injured. Chris Paul seems like a good guy off the court but his game is slimy. Also, “pulling the chair out” is kinda slimy too. So is all the dramatic acting to try to get foul calls. If he was the point guard on my team, MAYBE this stuff wouldn’t bother me so much. But objectively, it’s annoying and against the spirit of honest competition."
"Giannis begins his gather at the free throw line and contact is made one step after. he also leans in Torrey Craig with his shoulder to initiate the contact ([20s mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKA0uW-oKo)). it seems we've reached an impasse, but characterizing Torrey Craig's motion as 'preparing to sell the foul' is a pretty poor characterization regardless of the foul type.  thanks for the discussion and see you on sunday"
"The problem wasn't the FT disparity. It was the fact that Giannis was using his body ultra aggressively offensively crashing into people and the refs weren't keeping him in check. Since he was getting away with it, he got more and more reckless leading him to injure Torrey Craig. The refs can't just let him get away with blatant offensive fouls, the guy is an injury waiting to happen(an injury to himself as well) when he's allowed to play out of control. I'm all for a bit of physicality, I'm not expecting him to get a whistle every time he bumps someone, but damn. I just don't want to see anyone get injured. Including him."
That’s cuz Saric and Torrey Craig are injured. We were comfortably 9 deep when they were healthy
Torrey Craig too
"So now that giannis was allowed to play the whistle to the point that he got reckless and hurt Torrey Craig, we get to stop hearing about the reffing right?"
Torrey Craig
“Did you do it?” Yes. “What did it cost?” Torrey Craig
Torrey Craig tried to slide and fall down to get a cheap charge called. It was a blatant blocking foul and something that the league needs to start penalizing more harshly specifically because of how dangerous it is to both parties.
&gt;Giannis does not just truck into people and injure them.  [\*stares in Torrey Craig\*](https://streamable.com/wbt4cd)  [injury update from suns](https://twitter.com/Suns/status/1413335227422822400)
"Consistency is a weird thing though. I think they were trying to be consistent with that offensive foul call on Giannis at the end of the third, but that absolutely looked like a blocking foul. Giannis was going mach 11, but Torrey Craig didn't have his feet set and was still moving laterally"
"Torrey Craig took a charge, Chris Paul flopped lol. There’s the difference for ya."
And now Torrey Craig goes down
Torrey Craig
With the Torrey Craig injury I think blaming injuries is off the table too. They’re gonna need to stick Ayton in an oxygen chamber for the minutes he’s about to play.
Giannis gonna body Jrue and Middleton during practice like he did Torrey Craig.
Giannis has dropped his shoulder so many times he thought they wouldn't call it. It may cost Torrey Craig his carrer. You're crying over 4 freethrows.
"ABC when Torrey Craig went down: Hey cool, somebody got hurt. Now we can make some extra money if these ads!"
Torrey Craig just tore his ACL shiiiit
Giannis barreled into Torrey Craig causing him to come out of the game. Nice.
"Well that does it, with this injury the suns will be promptly going home, and the hogs at milhuakey are loving it! They absolutely love it! With the loss of the ""Very great"" Torrey Craig, this is a complete wrap. Giannis ""Mickeyakumpo"" Will be taking home his ""ring"" once and for all. May he enjoy it, because it will likely be the last one! I weep, you guys, I weep!I'm thinking of Giannis finally teaming up with Donovan ""Robbed"" mitchell and I weep at how great that combination is! The trade will be as follows: Rudy ""Very valuable"" gobert and a wonderful first round pick for The Greek Freak! And we all know that Giannis will be demanding it!"
“we just saw torrey craig go down what do we know so far?” bruh it happened 2 minutes ago we don’t know shit😭😭😭😭i hate espn
god dammit not torrey craig
That's not an intentionally dirty play by Giannis. Even if it was he's not doing it on Torrey Craig lmao
Yea cuz he purposely took Torrey Craig of all people out on purpose
Torrey Craig?
With Torrey out Abdel nader moves up in the lineup. Honestly wonder if we’ll see some Stix minutes with Dario and Craig both out. Prob a longshot
imagine if that was just some average dude instead of torrey craig

I'm so surprised they didnt call Torrey Craig for that. They never call Giannis for the offensive no matter how much he goes priest Holmes.
"Jesus christ, not torrey craig!"
Torrey Craig channeling his Chris Paul by injuring himself trying to draw a foul instead of playing defense
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
Jokic once *shoved* Torrey Craig into the right spot to make a play lol
Torrey Craig
"""Don't watch games"" Pritchard literally averaged 3 points per game on 13 minutes in the playoffs. What games are YOU watching?   Is Tyrese Maxey a scorer because he dropped 6 points per game in the playoffs in fewer minutes? Like is Pat Connaughton a scorer in your expert opinion?   Torrey Craig averaged 4 points on 12 minutes in the playoffs, let's consider him a scorer too.  ""People on this sub gotta learn to stop talking about players they don’t know about."" That's on me I'll keep quiet"
Don’t be defensive lmao. I don’t hate Thanasis. Saying he’s an NBA player accurate. Chalking it up to hate is just deflection. There’s literally nothing wrong with admitting he’s on the team because of Giannis but you’re defending the guy like you’re his agent.   Your point about Torrey Craig is also hilariously wrong. Craig actually has some sort of tangible scoring ability. He’s a semi efficient scorer on twice the volume as Thanasis and shoots a very good 37% from 3. He’s unquestionably a better player than Thanasis. The logic would point to Craig being traded for a reason outside of freeing up minutes for Thanasis. He likely got traded for salary considerations.
I wanted to murder Torrey Craig you have zero idea the breath of relief i gave
Torrey Craig blowing that layup at the end of game 7 vs Utah last yr
Yes.  By a fair amount.  Thanasis outplayed Torrey Craig when Craig was on the Bucks.
"Yeah we lost Craig, abdel Nader who played hisminutes before we traded for Torrey is pretty comparable though. It's a slight downgrade and he doesn't play as big as Torrey so he won't be as effective in those spot PF minutes, but he was coming off the bench before Torrey for a couple games in the playoffs after missing months with a knee injury, so idk I guess the coaches like him.   Jalen Smith is a PF yes and yes got some tools, but he almost literally didn't play last year. He certainly has the potential to grab those minutes and should be a contributor as thin as we are at the position and with him being a lottery pick, but I think suns fans are going in expecting nothing out of him because we haven't seen anything yet, good or bad.  The shamet trade is pretty good for us imo, and I like javale, but we're mostly just holding par."
"1. We're not doing much; as you can imagine we're looking to run it back more or less with a competent coach in Carlisle.   We drafted Duarte who's immediately going to be a rotational player. We lost Dougie McBuckets but signed Torrey Craig to help with the front court minutes and Oshae Brissett had enough of a promising end to the previous season that I could see him getting more minutes. We also retained TJ McConnell and will probably look to move Jeremy Lamb.  2. I guess I'm high on the Raptors because I think FVV is a solid guard. I think their lineup is pretty solid as is except for the fact that they're missing a center.   I'm not high on the Celtics though to put them in Tier 2 - they've continued to bleed talent over the past few years  4. I guess they're going to keep Simmons. If that's the case, they'll continue to be a solid regular season team and probably cap out at ECSF.  6. You're right. The East isn't as stacked as the West but a lot of teams in our conference have made major upgrades to their roster and fighting for playoff seeds is going to be difficult for any of my Tier 3 teams. Not looking forward to it."

Then sign Torrey Craig. Signing an offensive black hole would be stupid.
What the fuck that's nothing. Lot of dudes taking hometown discounts rn wow. That's insulting tho tbh. Torrey Craig and Jeff Green got more. Portia even at 2/14 would be a steal still.
"I'd love Hart, I think whoever they get with the MLE will be that mold. Tough, defensive-minded player, but for a while upgrading on the Torrey Craig role - versatile big-bodied wing, that can hypothetically play small ball five - was the most important spot to improve the roster - outside of backup center - and now that Torrey is off to Indiana, it's even more important."
Torrey Craig was huge for us against the Clippers but he wasn't a major factor in the other series.
"You're right about the Suns needing a backup big, but Torrey Craig isn't a big. He plays big and strong for his size, and we used him as a stop-gap because we were so thin on the front line, but he's really a small forward. He's only 6'7"", and we already have a ton of wing depth. My guess is we let him go to have a bit extra money to get an actual backup big.  Gonna miss him though. He played his heart out."
NBA Champion Torrey Craig
"All I'm saying is you don't have to pay 30m per year to have a player able to defend 1-4 and be useless on offense. There are plenty of dogs like that available for the vets min just like PJ Tucker, Iguadala, Torrey Craig etc."
"Huh? We can pay CP, max Ayton, close to max Bridges, pay Cam Payne and still have room to sign some depth pieces from what I’ve read. We just traded for SG depth, all we really need is a wing and a big. Suns subreddit seems high on a guy like McGee signing with us and he won’t be too expensive. Could maaaybe get Iguodala if we don’t sign Torrey Craig and Iguodala wants to play here."
"If the Suns aren’t pursuing him, JaVale on a cheaper contract and other use of the MLE to upgrade on the Torrey Craig, back up 4 versatile defender, is the only acceptable alternative."
"Yeah I would expect dudes like JJ Reddick and Torrey Craig to sign minimums, I dont think that really turns much though."
"Torrey Craig likely,  if he were to hit everything he’s an iteration of Jimmy Butler"
"They likely can only fill out the roster with veteran minimum contracts, G leaguers, and the tax payer MLE. That means players have to take a pay cut or get marginal players at best.   Bryn Forbes, Torrey Craig, McDermott, McConell, Bullock, Malik Monk, and Wes Mathews are examples.  It would likely be a thin roster at best when it comes to shooting.  I think the Buddy Hield play makes more sense if the Lakers keep KCP and their pick."
There goes Torrey Craig 😞  Beloved by Suns fans.
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"
"I don't hate the guy or anything and I think he might even put up decent points and rebounds if he got to start at the 4 somewhere, but 538 had him between Solomon Hill, Wes Iwundu, Taurean Prince, Thad Young and Torrey Craig last year. That's what, an 8-10M guy in Thad, a 5-6M guy in Prince, a 3-4M guy in Craig and a couple minimum guys. Kuzma is younger than those guys except Iwundu, but I think you're still talking 20M over 3 kind of deal, though as I said I think if he moved to a non-playoff team where he could be a full-time 4 he would probably put up decent numbers.  As a Raptors fan, if Lowry signs with you guys and we have 19M in cap space, I wouldn't be stoked if we spent 13M of that on Kuzma. The Lakers have apparently been offering him and KCP all over town for a reason, and it's not because LeBron think he's a solid rotation guy. He's shot 40 percent in the playoffs and 28% on 3s in the 5 playoff series he's been in at age 25 and 26.  Though ironically, I think he'd be a good fit for us at forward next to whichever of OG or Siakam is sitting. Kuzma is a tantalizing player, but there's no real evidence he's more than a 9th man. My guess is he goes somewhere, puts up slightly better numbers but doesn't help his team win. But today? I think he's a 7M guy on potential and 5M on actuality. I wouldn't trust him over a guy like JaMychal Green and that seems like a guy who would be overpaid at 10M a year, never mind 13. He's not Marcus Morris, he's a guy who in theory could be."
"They also hit on Murray, MPJ, Torrey Craig, Nurkic and Gary Harris.  The nuggets have drafted extremely well. Take away jokic and they are still sitting pretty in terms of how they drafted."
I’d like Torrey Craig to stay with the Nuggets.
"The Suns  CP3/Booker/Bridges/Crowder/Kaminsky   Bench: Cam Payne, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Obviously Kaminsky is less than ideal, but Saric and Ayton aren’t American unfortunately"
Torrey Craig and $10000000000000000000000000
Well Torrey Craig gets a ring while trying to stop the Bucks from winning… why shouldn’t Illyasova get one too? It’s weird how the ring system works with traded/released players.
"Booker was very poor at running the offense. The only players with a worse offensive rating than him over the series were Cam Payne and Torrey Craig, and the gap between him and the rest was significant.   Booker: 104  CP3: 118  Ayton: 120  Bridges: 121  Crowder: 112  Johnson: 126  ----------------  For all of his individual greatness, playing through Book hurt the Suns offense as a whole."
honestly the suns didnt seem to be trying to draw charges as much outside of that one from torrey craig that i remember. jeff green/blake griffin were more brave than most of the suns team
"Beat a bad Heat team.  Was on their way to being swept by the Nets before Kyrie hurt his ankle when he landed on Giannis foot in the paint. Harden also reinjured his leg.  Close series with the Hawks until Trae Young got a bone bruise on his foot and was never the same. Also Capella was hit in the eyes in the series and was dealing with inflammation the rest of the way.  Then against the Suns, CP3 gets his ankle rolled by a flagrant foul by Brook Lopez. Booker also smacked in his broken nose again in game 3 of the series. Saric blows out his ACL. Cam Payne and Torrey Craig also suffer injuries during the series.  Giannis put on a show, but nothing compared to what KD did against way better talent"
Jalen Smith has bust written all over him. The coaches see him day in day out. If they thought he could contribute they would've given him minutes. Suns had to pick up Kaminsky from the Kings and Torrey Craig from the Bucks mid season to fill up the backup roles. If there was a G-League he would've been there all season.
"Actually there was a ton of differences between this year and last. Ayton not getting suspended and hella players not constantly getting injured fucking up the lineup stability. Having Cam Payne on the roster ever since the start of the bubble AND they made other roster improvements aside from just CP3, like Crowder, Torrey Craig, Galloway, Etwan Moore etc. And the young core had a year of experience with Monty and the coaching staff under their belts, and obviously a year of development towards their primes. And they upgraded from the worst training facility in the league to one of the best. etc  It was obvious to anyone who watched them consistently last year that they were a playoff team already if Ayton never got suspended and they never had all those constant guys getting injured. So by them staying healthy and all the other upgrades I mentioned, I'd say they would have been 5th seed at least especially if they traded Oubre for a legit PF instead of CP3 and kept Rubio who was a good fit here. But of course getting CP3 just helped them get to a whole nother level and almost finish with the best record in the league and getting to the finals. CP3 was basically a shortcut to reach some of their goals faster and get that valuable deep playoff run experience for the young guys.   If we don't re-sign CP3(which I'm leaning towards not re-signing him rn since he's getting older and already disappeared multiple times in the Finals), hopefully his mentorship he gave the young dudes and all of this valuable experience pays off and they can still be a damn good team especially if they use some of that money coming off the books to get a true backup center and a legit 4 who can play defense and can start."
Will Torrey Craig get a ring?
"Thanks. I was just wondering if this bonus pushing them into the tax this year started the clock earlier than they planned, or pushed up the timeline of the amount of years into the repeater tax and when you would begin to see it in their roster contruction.   Guess that would depend on if they’ve been a tax team the past few years (which I thought they were?) This headline seems to suggest that the Torrey Craig trade is now irrelevant for ducking the luxury tax this year.  Anyways this may all be irrelevant if the cap jumps due to gambling or more TV money.."
Don't players normally get rings if they were on the roster at some point during the season? Can't imagine he doesn't.   I wonder about Torrey Craig though
The suns were just inexperienced. He is better now but with better defense they could have slowed him down. In the 1st rd series vs heat. He had 23ppg on 43%FG. Monty williqms decided to guard him one on one instead of building a wall and keeping him out of the paint.. they should have played torrey craig at PF instead of jae crowder. They needed size but they lost being stupid
Don't forget Torrey Craig!
Torrey Craig lol
"Anderson Varejao spent his all his best years in Cleveland, that was the chief reason they offered him a ring  Torrey Craig probably a nice dude but he ain't got that kinda love from Milwaukee"
It took PJ Tucker over 36 minutes to match the number of points Torrey Craig scored in 48 seconds. SMH
I had to take my dog for a walk...did Torrey Craig join his teammates on the podium?
Someone get Torrey Craig his ring
NBA champion Torrey Craig
Congrats Torrey Craig
Congrats on the ring Torrey Craig
CONGRATULATIONS TO NBA CHAMPION TORREY CRAIG!!!!
Does Torrey Craig still get a ring?
Was Torrey Craig really that bad for the suns to get stuck on the bench?
Torrey “getting a ring either way” Craig
Torrey Craig with the Tony Snell statline.
Honestly I don’t know why torrey Craig hasn’t gotten playing time he defends Giannis prettt decent
Torrey Craig
"If that's the case, then that could be a major reason behind the bad numbers for Chris Paul. No Ayton severely hampers their defense as they've been having to play Torrey Craig as a small ball 5 when he's out."
"Suns missed a lot of shots? [everyone but Cameron Payne (3-7, 42.9%) and Torrey Craig (1-4, 25%) made at least half of their shot attempts, with seven players shooting better than 60%.](https://www.nba.com/news/inside-the-box-score-2021-nba-finals-game-5)"
"I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Sure, they should've taken more 3s maybe throughout the game, but they blew their huge lead while Devin sat and Jae and Torrey Craig started bricking 3s leading to easy buckets for the Bucks..    When you build a 16 point lead you don't just start settling for 3s, you have to be more methodical. Booker sitting out for so long killed the Suns' momentum"
I disagree with that definition. Kenny Smith and Torrey Craig don't belong in the same category of player quality.
That wasnt even the worst mistake of the series! Game 7 Torrey Craig missed a layup in the final seconds that gave Conley the chance at the last shot to win. If Conley's shot goes in that goes down as an all time blunder for sure
Because we were lacking size.  Our backup center was Torrey Craig.
"""Jalens a great young player""  We have 0 evidence of that. Backup minutes were there to be had. Smith wasn't good enough to earn them. He was a disappointing pick and Suns fans are trying to hard to defend that.  The only reason we brought in Torrey Craig was because we had minutes at backup PF and a hole to be plugged. Smith wasn't good enough to get minutes"

torrey craig got a ring with the bucks even though he was playing for the suns in the finals
Nader seems cool but he's definently the weak point in our bench.  I really miss Torrey Craig
"Torrey ""hustle plays"" Craig"
"The first couple weeks of NBA when I'm getting reoriented with all the roster changes is pretty fun. Like Olynyk being a Piston or DJJ being a Bull or Torrey Craig being a Pacer. Like, I probably saw these all in headlines over the last couple months but it hits different now."
"I'm talking about the team getting out of the contract without taking any money back at all so as not to increase the tax penalty as we did with Torrey Craig last season, I know it wouldn't be difficult to trade him for an equivalent bad contract"
They're gonna give the broken ring to Torrey Craig since he ended up on the Suns come finals time
"As a Nuggets fan, would you care to guess how well Torrey Craig shot from 3 in the NBL? He had 2 seasons at 40%, and went on to basically be a non-shooter in the NBA. These things don't translate like that."
2010 Magic  Jamal Murray (Jameer Nelson)  Caris LeVert (Vince Carter)  Torrey Craig (Matt Barnes)  Nicolas Batum (Rashard Lewis)  Clint Capela (Dwight Howard)
"There's no way they beat the Clippers without Ayton. You think Frank Kaminsky is going up over Zubac for an alley-oop game winner (game 2)? You think Torrey Craig is going to get the Suns 9 extra possessions in a game they won by 4 (game 4)?  Heck, they might not have even beat the Lakers."
Makes up for us basically dumping Torrey Craig for a ham sandwich last year.
"Added Oubre but lost Graham. I just don't see that as much of an upgrade.  Pacers on the other hand added Torrey Craig and get a healthy LeVert who gets a chance to integrate after his health issues after the trades last year.   I don't think anything about the Raptors last season really matters, playing in Tampa meant that the players played every single game on the road in a sense. Adding Scottie Barnes and Achiuwa and flipping Lowry for Dragic leaves them in a better spot but the bigger deal is just being back in Toronto."
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
"Because he's like a Torrey Craig (who he actually outplayed for us last year): He's a guy who had a lot of athletic ability but wasn't anywhere near good enough until he went overseas and developed into an end of the bench guy.  He's not going to ever be better than an end of the bench guy, but he's good for situational defense."
denver always coming with dudes I've never heard before and have them play well...it was Craig torrey and monte morris previously
see that’s the thing our true second unit being some kind of comp of McConnell - Duarte - Justin Holiday - Torrey Craig - Goga/Jackson  with Oshae Brissett and Jeremy Lamb still behind them but in the mix - we’re a DEEP team   however it’s gonna be a mixed bag of injuries as it always is so not sure what the second unit will be
With our injury history it's always going to be muddled but our second unit has been great for a number of years. Torrey Craig was a really underrated acquisition.
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
i wish we could have kept torrey craig instead of nader
This is a couple years ago right? Torrey craig still on the nugs
"Let's just say you are grossly oversimplified the situation.  The year we won 54 (54!) games Barton and Gary got badly hurt (and have never been the same). There were two other above average starters on that team (Murray, Sap) and then a bunch of kids. Young players are almost always net negatives and yet we came within a game of the WCF. If Barton and Gary had stayed healthy you'd have a point-- but they didn't.  The next year we traded Malik bc he wanted to be a starter and brought in Grant. But Sap's play fell off a cliff and Harris play fell off a cliff post-injuries. I'd call them both below average starters by playoff team standards. Morris rise sort of replaced Malik. Torrey Craig is a solid 10th man but the rest of the bench was a net negative pretty much the whole year due to the lack of scoring. People also have a misperception in regards to how good Grant for us. Every stat painted him as a negative player until he was moved to SF in the playoffs. Luckily Murray took a leap forward. And as to MPJ-- the reason he wasn't playing is bc Malone was focused on developing him as a player and getting rid of bad habbits. Again, young players usually don't add to winning.  Last year was the most talented team on paper... except we lost Grant and Plumlee (our backup Cs were AWFUL) and right when we traded for Gordon we lost Barton, Monte, PJ and Murray to injury.  Long story short-- as the guys original comment indicated- we have had horrific injury luck during Jokic's main run. Including injuries that destroyed the career of Harris and turned Barton injury plagued. Meanwhile-- a lot of the depth you point to were kids on rookie contracts aka that period in a career where they aren't particularly good. But our coaching staff is elite at player development and so they are in a good place to take a leap once they leave Denver (see Malik, Vandy or even Grant)."
"And I’m super happy about it, mostly because I disagree heavily with your criticisms of those players.  In terms of the surrounding cast, you’re always going to have role players on smaller deals surrounding your max players on any contending team. Denver happens to be very good at finding and developing talent through the draft/udfas/2-way contracts etc. Monte Morris, PJ dozier, Torrey Craig, Terence Davis, Kendrich Williams we’re all 2 way guys our FO found just in the past few years."
"Giannis is a goddamn nightmare for Ayton. We also lost Saric and Cam Payne in the Finals, and had to play Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader for significant stretches. Bucks were just better and deserved to win."
"Giannis went Super Saiyan, and Bobby Portis became Charles Oakley. We also lost Saric and Cam Payne, which meant we had to play Abdel fucking Nader and Torrey Craig for significant minutes. The Bucks were just better than us in the end. Different story this year, I think. JaVale McGee, Shamet, and the development of Bridges and Cam Johnson are all a significant upgrade from last year's supporting cast."
"You don't get recognition by calling out Torrey Craig*  **With all due respect to Mr. Craig, who is playing basketball as a paid job, which is awesome.*"
Torrey Craig has got to be every coaches favourite player. he's just a dog who always plays in the system. love that man.
I miss Torrey Craig so much.  Payne/Shamet/Johnson/Craig/Mcgee is such a solid bench line up.  I really hope we get another forward before the deadline.
"I understand blowing the whistle when a player blatantly shoved someone to the floor on an “ankle breaker” (basically every Harden crossover ever, KD on Torrey Craig and a lot of PG’s too) but this as clean as it gets."
Especially when scrubs like Torrey Craig get them lol
"That's a move I definitely didn't expect from Torrey Craig, damn he looked good."
Improved on some ways too. McGee is a legit backup C. And shamet is better than Jevon carter or etwuan Moore. We miss Torrey Craig though :(
IMO Suns should have kept Torrey Craig on the team. I was impressed by his playoff performance last season and couldn't believe Suns just let him walk.
"They're doing ok, but they could do better. The Suns best 3 point shooter Cam Johnson bulked up in the offseason and has struggled so far. Ayton missed some games and hasn't found his rhythm with the team as well as Javale Mcgee has. Letting Torrey Craig go has been a big loss for them off the bench. I'm hoping they make a trade and fill that void."

RIP Torrey Craig
I got Torrey Craig misaligned. He was the leader for Indiana
"A lot of people on this sub really leaned in super hard on the whole ""they only played teams with injuries and got lucky lol fraud team"" narrative and ignored or forgot that the team with the 2nd best record in the NBA last season (and played at 63-win pace in an 82-game season after an 8-8 start) brought back everyone on the team who was a key contributor but Torrey Craig, and improved as well by bringing in Shamet (who hasn't been great yet still) and McGee (added big man depth).   Not to mention a lot of these wins have come without Ayton, and with both two key rotation pieces in Shamet and Cam Johnson struggling, so you can argue the Suns aren't even close to their best form and still winning games and taking their position at the top of the West behind the Warriors and around the top of the NBA.   It's predictable given a lot of r/nba drives their NBA discourse based on narratives, but still...yeah, I am biased sure but the Suns are definitely being overlooked when it comes to discussions about who can contend for the West and the title. Honestly though I prefer it that way."
"100% this. Monty got spooked after Frank was bullied by Jokic in a Suns/Nuggets game late in the season, and didn't want to play Frank too much against AD/Jokic/Giannis in the playoffs. He instead opted to go small when Ayton had to rest with Torrey Craig at the 5.  We definitely could have used Frank's size and physicality those games. I love me some Torrey Craig, but it's a lot to ask him/Crowder/Cam to box out Giannis/Portis/Lopez."
Did Torrey Craig think he knew the play and ended up leaving green wide open?
Had no idea Torrey Craig was traded to Indiana
"I'd honestly be okay with that lineup with Torrey Craig at the 4. So if we add a player that's even better then that's just a bonus for me lol. I'd also be fine looking into trading Sabonis with Caris for a true point guard, then running a [insert PG] Brogdon, Duarte, Craig, Myles lineup."
Torrey Craig too.
Nader really isn't it. Suns should've used the rest of that mid-level on Torrey Craig.  Fun game to watch though. Good to see even with Ayton out they can hold their own. Hopefully the Suns continue to gel so they're ready to push for good seeding ASAP
"Suns look like they’re trying new things out offensively, plus CP3 is coming off an injury and Book is coming back from COVID so feeling neutral there. Defense has been concerning though, that’s the one thing that was super consistent last season and we are very clearly missing having guys like Torrey Craig and Dario Saric as small ball switchable pieces off the bench.  I’m confident things will even out but I really hope we find a way to add someone who can fill in as a switchable 4/5, Thad Young was on the radar for a while but I don’t know that it’ll happen"
"Probably one of those three centers might go to Chicago as they need anyone with an resemblance of a rim protection in an otherwise good roster  Anyways Im guessing for us Stix unless Monty rapidly starts trusting him, we need a physical PF to fill the Torrey Craig void, so Stix+ Saric or Stix+ a pick for Thaddeus Young?"
"Butler, Curry, Giannis, Jokic and of course the GOAT Torrey Craig"
Stud. Nuggets haven't had a guy that could get 12/5 and guard the opposing star wing since Torrey Craig.

I’ll always be a Torrey Craig fan even if he’s been banished to the shadow realm
Why tf are you comparing anyone on this sub to 6’7” 220lbs Torrey Craig lmao
 Torrey Craig is in the air before Harden is in his shooting motion and Harden jumps into him. Here’s a [pic](https://i.imgur.com/UQPPwxi.jpg) that makes it very obvious.
Torrey Craig can't win with these cats
"so to the people who don't like this foul call, what's harden supposed to do when he fakes someone into jumping to block? is he supposed to travel? shot clock violation? just take torrey craig landing on him?"
Some of these Nets players are the worst defenders I've seen lol  How do you get cooked by Torrey Craig
"Torrey ""Dennis Rodman"" Craig mixes it up and swishes a fadeaway jumper"
Are the Nets just allergic to guarding Torrey Craig?
Torrey Craig has to retire now. RIP
"You forgot the most important, Torrey Craig"
Torrey Craig revenge tour. He will always be a Nugget in my heart tho
"This will make me sound like a homer of course, but the sun's have the most balance.  They had the best record in the NBA against teams that made the playoffs this year.  They have a center who can guard all five positions unlike Gobert.  In addition Ayton is much more versatile on offense.  Sun's also added Torrey Craig late in the season who is a very undervalued pickup especially against a team like the nets who have wings for days, which is what Craig is good at defending.    The sun's probably have the best player in the league when it comes to attempting to defend harden and Durant in Mikal Bridges.  I also don't know what the nets are going to do to defend deandre ayton."
"Our fanbase sucks ass. Yesterday I was arguing with a dude who was acting like Torrey Craig deserved to be in the G League when he was with us, just so fucking entitled"
"That Bridges trade, Cam Johnson   I still for the record hate their last pick tho.. jalen smith   Halliburton was the pick.. imagine him taking over for paul, giving booker a break or just taking Torrey Craig mins in small ball lineup"
Fr he didn’t even bump kcp but got a tech.. then refs watched it and still after being like damn we went overboard gave Torrey Craig a tech for what was a loose ball foul   Sidenote: Torrey Craig needs to play less
"Torrey Craig has been great too, although he's in a limited role in the playoffs"
"on replay review, that's a second technical on Torrey Craig"
Man Torrey Craig is frustrating to watch
"Him and Torrey Craig, need Monty to play them the entire 4th"
Torrey Craig killing the Suns on the offensive end
Torrey Craig is major ass
"Torrey Craig has been pretty bad this quarter, can't believe it but I'd rather see Frank get some more minutes tonight"
Torrey Craig is their Kyle Kuzma.
My dad just called Torrey Craig a bum lmfao
Torrey Craig playin for LA tonight
Torrey Craig is trash right now
"Boy, I thought everyone learned from how Utah-Denver ended last year that you don't want Torrey Craig on the floor in a high-stress, high-leverage situation."
"Give the Suns credit, Ayton comes out just as the Lakers are dying to win the rebound battle and yet Torrey Craig grabs some blood pressure lowering rebounds"
Why did they retroactively give Torrey Craig a technical but not this?
"If Torrey Craig got respect from the refs, he would be a superstar no doubt"
"The refs went back in time to call a foul on Torrey Craig. They're going to start calling fouls from game 3, don't worry."
How does the refs missing the call lead to a tech for Torrey Craig?
Did they just give Torrey Craig a T for a Wes Matthews flop?! Lol
Why is the Torrey Craig play a technical and not a flagrant though?
Torrey Craig sounds like a supermodel name
They gave a T to Torrey Craig too lol
Torrey Craig issued a technical foul for contact on a rebound? Wtf
Torrey Craig gets a tech?! What?!
What's the Torrey Craig tech?!
Tf did Torrey Craig do?
Torrey Craig technical!?!!
How the fuck can torrey craig get a tech for something that happened a year ago
"In a game where ever Suns player is balling tf out and locked in, Torrey Craig has stuck out like a sore thumb. Hopefully he can pick it up"
Torrey Craig bro what is you doing 🤣
Can we talk about Torrey Craig missing every layup
lol Torrey Craig didn't even hit the rim on the point blank layup
they have torrey craig hitting stepback jumpers..this game is over lmaoo
You know the Lakers are doing bad when Torrey Craig is getting second quarter minutes
"Pretty incredible how deep they are even after losing Malik Beasley, Plumblee, Grant, and Torrey Craig."
"Even crazier when you realize we've also drafted/signed really good quality players in Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig and Huancho who we just didn't have the money to keep around. Not sure how we keep replacing guys but it's nice. Pretty sure Hampton is gonna wind up to be a good player too, but I'm fine with giving up him to get AG.  Also nailed it with the Jerami Grant trade last year. Acquiring PJ Dozier was clutch too. I thought we were gonna take a dip in that department when Masai left but we really haven't missed a beat."
"Torrey Craig for DEN, in 2019.  With that said, Luka is doing this against Kawhi _and_ PG."
"There is a lot of assumption in there that is totally unnecessary. I like Torrey Craig and I am happy to see him doing well.  TC was a good defensive player in specific matchups, a mediocre defensive player in most matchups, and a bad offensive player with Jokic, constantly out of position. He was well liked by players and he played hard. He was a depth player and didnt fit on a roster with a million other guards and his best matchups aging up or moving to the east (westbrook and harden).  But having a basic criticism isnt 'shitting' on him, nor does it reveal all of my thoughts on him. Frankly, expecting every single thought on him right there doesnt make sense either. You know what I cant stand? People who cant handle dealing with a portion of a conversation at a time and need the 'whole story' every single sentence."
"Torrey ""The Padlock"" Craig makes an appearance"
thats NBL legend Torrey Craig
"LeBron tried to push Torrey Craig away with his arm too, then act surprised when he didn't get a foul call"
"Hey LeBron, the other day after Game 5 ADisney called Torrey Craig a great father. What type of parental role has Torrey played for you and your teammates?"
*signs Torrey Craig*  Blazers: That solves our defense!
TORREY CRAIG IS THE GOAT
No theyll add Torrey Craig and Denzel valentine then run it back
1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
I love Torrey Craig wtf
Torrey Craig almost did the Spyda and1 celebration
"the lebron/torrey craig play looked like a foul to me, and we've had a couple 50/50s since. nothing egregious but feels like we're getting benefit of the doubt."
Why the Bucks traded Torrey Craig for cash I will not know
NEPHEWS LISTEN UP: Torrey Craig and Cam Payne are taking it to your GOAT. LMAO
If Torrey Craig is allowed to touch LeBron like that then I don't know what league I'm watching
"Lol what. Ayton is an elite defensive anchor who's p switcheable. Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and Torrey Craig are some of the best defenders to throw at Lebron."
"1) You clearly don't take his high ankle sprain seriously, and you should  2) THE SUNS ARE REALLY GOOD ON DEFENSE. Give my boys some credit! Jeez.   Go watch the film. Ayton made his life a living hell.  And btw, LeBron drove to the rim more times than any other game this season in game 4 per Zach Lowe...so...you're going to just need to give the Suns and Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder and Torrey Craig some credit.   LeBron has been killing Cam Johnson though. You can have that."
"&gt; the tools to defend Lebron (Bridges/Crowder)  Don't forget Cam Johnson and Torrey Craig. James Jones (one of lebron's favorite teamates)  built our roster to have as good a chance to guard lebron as possible. 4 guys that are all long, good defenders, and don't get tired because there are so many of them.   AD was always the tougher matchup because they usually play another big. But the AD at the 5 vs ayton is a battle"
Some think the Suns should play Torrey Craig at center. Fits the mold of an undersized but good defensive player in the mold of Draymond Green or PJ Tucker playing undersized 5 (not to say Craig is as good as them).
It’s probably Torrey Craig.
"suns have mikal bridges, jae crowder, cam johnson, Torrey Craig to throw at him. all those guys are long and good defenders. plus there is ayton on the help rotation. the suns defense is really good. its a lot to handle. even for lebron."
dog im so upset we gave torrey craig away. i don't understand it. he's literally another PJ tucker. Imagine if we had two of them!
I’ve said it 100 times and I’ll say it again - I cannot comprehend how Cam Payne couldn’t find a roster all of last year until the bubble. I can’t believe we got him and Torrey Craig for free.
that whole sequence leading to the Torrey Craig dunk was a crazy rollercoaster of emotions
"Name two former Bucks players past or present better than Torrey Craig and Wes Matthews. That’s right, you can’t"
Marc Gasol playing against Torrey Craig at center lol.  Trez would own that.
Most of these Suns players are too shook for the big stage. A lot of asinine missed tip-ins like that Torrey Craig one. What the hell??
At this point Torrey Craig or Cam Johnson should probably get Jae’s minutes. His shots just won’t go in
"We actually could not have signed Augustin. It would have been Thanasis, Torrey Craig, and maybe another vet min."
"ayton has been great, booker has played so badly the last 2 games it's clear that there's something not right with him mentally.    the lakers are in his head, at one point they left him totally wide open from the 3 point line and just dared him to shoot.. not even bothering to close out  little things like that are adding up to throw booker off his game, it's his first trip to the playoffs ever and the combination of nerves + LA's tight defense + losing CP3 are wearing on him.  and it all cumulated in shoving shroeder and fouling out at the end of game3  I know the playoffs are not the time when you want to mess with your lineups, you generally know which guys are gonna be in your rotation going in, but the suns have to do something at this point.    Paul can barely move and when he is on the court he can't shoot, can't defend and turns the ball over a lot.   They need Payne to play big minutes and be effective in most of them, they might need to start playing jevon carter, try to generate more looks for torrey craig and bridges  But really the big thing is booker needs to play better... if he's going to mentally check out then the suns wont win.  If his teammates were hitting some 3's that would help him I think because LA couldn't sell out the 3 point line as much to pack the paint"
Torrey Craig was really good defending him off the bench too.
"Now THIS is the game Lakers showed some teeth.   Bron drove more aggressively.  Monty didn't adjust on them finding answers for how to cover Booker so that part was a disaster.   Chris Paul :(  Game 4 Monty needs to show some more coaching chops. Two straight games he went with the game 1 gameplan hoping Chris Paul can execute this time. I get wanting to trust the hall of famer, but man that has hurt us. At least the ""not 100%"" Lakers stars can execute. Game 4 is our entire season on the line, 3-1 can't be fought unless there's a big Lakers injury and you never hope for those.  Even if you get hit in the nuts Book, please don't push someone mid-air. Playing dirty I am fine with, doing something that can actually be VERY dangerous potentially is different.  Torrey Craig is the only wing that hasn't looked trash in his minutes in this series. He's gotten the least of them.  Nothing is a bigger indictment on how the past two games have gone than the Suns making Andre Drummond playable.  Ayton has played himself into the max. If he keeps improving, he can make it look good. Mikal on the other hand gave us a big discount which is good news long term.  Despite the bad game 3, I like how good the Suns have been overall. Think they will be even better next season if Sarver allows it.  SO many times the Lakers close out is obviously good, but our guys can get the shot off but they hesitate for half a second and don't fire. Don't be scared of them. They have played like 20 minutes like they're better than you."
"The Jazz always have that too. TJ McConnell, JJ Barea and Austin Rivers absolutely destroy us every time we play them.   Torrey Craig has been known to get hot and shoot 90% on 7 3s against us. It’s brutal."
Hope we keep Torrey Craig
FEED TORREY CRAIG
So u forgot about Jeremi Grant and Torrey Craig?
"I wonder if we'll see other players utilized in Game 3 by the Suns. They have a deep bench of shooters, Torrey Craig, Etuwan Moore, Langston Galloway, and even Jevon Carter can get streaky. If I'm Monty Williams, I'm looking for my bench to step it up on defense against Schroeder when Lebron and AD are out.   For those that are trying to say this series is over without CP3 is maybe forgetting how good these bench players have been. The Suns are deep. And they have the best record in the NBA when they're playing AWAY games."
It’s like Monty wants the Suns to lose. Switch Saric with Torrey Craig!
Facts. Why the hell isn’t Torrey Craig in there!?!?!?
As a Nugget fan. I sure do miss Torrey CrAIG.
Torrey Craig!!! Saric could never.
lakers will take Torrey Craig above the break threes all game
Saric so bad. Get Torrey Craig in there!
Saric so bad. Get Torrey Craig in there.
"I think Gasol is just a little too old/slow to give Ayton too many issues, but if the Lakers decided to slot in Trez at the 4 and AD at the 5, that lineup would be really hard to beat.   Our second best rebounder is Torrey Craig and our two bigs off the bench (Saric and Kaminsky) simply can’t defend the paint or work the post consistently.   The Suns can pack the paint like they’ve done effectively against Giannis and Embiid, but I really don’t like the prospects of that in a playoff series.   The Suns can pull it off if our wings get hot from 3. If Cam Johnson, Mikal Bridges, and Jae Crowder are hitting their shots, we’re very tough to beat."
"Well to be fair, we can play this game all day.  \- Suns couldn't buy a FTA  \- Bridges offensive game was just extremely off  \- Crowder was 0-7 from the 3  \- Torrey Craig wasn't utilized much  \- Paul injured  Fact is **neither team were at their best yesterday.**  Only thing both teams seem to do well was keep each other under 100.  Point is, there were a lot of ""ifs"" that will change game 2.  LeBron's horrible game is one of them.  If LeBron played like normal LeBron they could have very well won this game, but y'all gotta stop discounting the Suns.  I know you haven't watched them as much as some of us have, but it feels like many of you have 0 clue what this team is about.  They didn't luck their way to #2 and there's a reason why the Suns **have the best record vs playoff teams** than any other team this season."
"Decent options in UFA are Olynyk, Jeff Green, Hardaway Jr, Millsap, Rivers, Bazemore, McConnell, McDermott, Markieff, Harkless, Tucker, James Johnson, Bullock, Burks, Noel, Danny Green, Dwight, Torrey Craig, Kanter, RHJ, Gay, Mills, RoLo."
"we won that game with half a Chris Paul, Crowder not hitting a 3, Cam Payne getting ejected and Torrey Craig barely playing... wow"
Yea that's been one of our strengths all season.  The fact that we got Torrey Craig for free still mind boggles me.
"Exactly, Torrey Craig and Gary Harris were game changers."
"yup! iirc him, Bobby and Torrey Craig showed up on the same day. one of the better bench moves we’ve made recently, i stan Portis and Forbes has stepped up more over the season"
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
"If it comes down to Cam Payne or Torrey Craig as far as who to keep, it has to be Cam Payne."
E'Twaun Moore  Langston Galloway  Frank Kaminsky  Torrey Craig (:/)
on free agency  etwuan moore  langston galloway  frank kaminsky  abdel nader  torrey craig  tyshon alexander  getting traded  jevon carter  jalen smith  cam johnson  dario saric
"Honestly I think Torrey Craig will probably get that, he's really proven to be a tenacious defender"
They aren't getting past the Torrey Craig led suns
Booker  Mikal  Ayton  Cam johnson  Cam Payne  Jevon Carter  CP3  Jae crowder or torrey Craig. probably crowder. he would have a higher chance of being drafted but could see both leaving if not protected.
I would in fact be down. As long as you mean borrow. Shit you can borrow Kev and Gallo too. Y'all bench needs some help honestly. Nader and Torrey Craig ain't it chief.
"There was a game where Jrue was wearing a headband, and we had headband wearing Torrey Craig. Both plus Bobby on the court at once it was rough."
"They retroactively called a (technical?) foul on Torrey Craig for the previous play when they were reviewing HIM getting fouled on the next play during the Denver series. As in, the play they called him for wasn't even the play being reviewed.   Refs and reviews: where everything's made up and the points don't matter."
Torrey Craig 100%
Why does it matter what Torrey Craig thinks?
Wtf Torrey Craig
It's like every single role player on the sun's is crucial. Just such a well rounded roster. I can't think of one player that they wouldnt be worse off not having besides maybe Torrey Craig as much as that pains me to say.
"not at all true, he is legit a rotation player in the league, even outplayed torrey craig for the last rotation spot (granted, bucks play style has a lot to do with that)"
"It’s not just fans. Offense is objectively more valuable. That’s why Torrey Craig gets cut from teams while Trae Young is a legit star. If you can put them both together, fantastic. But offense will always be more valuable than defense, and incremental gains in offense will always outpace incremental gains on defense, value-wise."
Torrey Craig a bum for that one. George was able to wait until the ball bounced as far as it could before he had to pick it up at half court.
"glad he's been cleared, but i'd be surprised if he gets any minutes. torrey craig was an upgrade."
Torrey Craig is no stranger to wearing a mask either.
"When your worst contributor is Torrey Craig, your team is pretty fucking good"
Bro. Cam Johnson+Mikal Bridges+Torrey Craig is some defensive guru shit.
Torrey Craig finals mvp
Torrey Craig
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"my issue has nothing to do with the teams that are in the finals.  this is a player-driven league, and the fact is this season has had injuries/absences from impactful players way way more than previous seasons.  it is due to the condensed schedule and covid-19, but that doesn't make the product any better.  people want to see Kawhi Leonard much more than they want to see Marcus Morris.  they want to see CP3 more than they want to watch Torrey Craig.  i don't really care what teams are in the Finals, but i want the best players beating the other best players to get there.  the product is definitely diminished this year due to Covid."
"Yeah, the Suns are the one team from the West that I would feel decidedly uncomfortable against. Not to discredit any of the other teams because obviously the West was solid from top to bottom, but the Suns specifically are a brutal matchup for us. They've got:  * Two of the best midrange shooters in the game with the guys you mentioned, who specifically exploit the weakest part of our general defensive scheme  * One of the handful of guys that can defend Giannis in a strict 1v1 with no help defense in Ayton, given that he comes relatively close to matching Giannis's blend of athleticism, strength, size, and length  * A slew of good perimeter shooters as role players, almost assuredly containing at least 1 player who will go absolutely supernova for the series like Herro, Vanvleet, and plenty of others that I'm sure my mind's blocking out (my money's on Torrey Craig because of course it would be the guy that we gave to them for essentially nothing)  There's a reason that we haven't done particularly well against the Suns in recent history, and facing them in the Finals (if we make it - just want to make it clear to both Hawks fans and the basketball gods that I absolutely am *not* taking that for granted) would be akin to receiving Draymond's natural shooting motion to the nads."
"Yeah except Torrey Craig, he’s a big reason the clippers been in the game"
It’s kind of amazing Torrey Craig couldn’t get more than $2 million on the market. He’s having his 2nd straight very useful playoffs in a row
What’s wrong with Torrey Craig
"Torrey Craig had a good series vs Denver, but just is ass in the WCF"
Came here to comment that Torrey Craig has corner specialist on hall of ass
"What distance was greater, how far any Clipper was to Torrey Craig or how far off the resultant shot was?"
That's the Torrey Craig Nuggets fans remember
Breen hyping the shit out of the torrey craig open three only for him to air ball.
"Why is Moore's ass playing and not Torrey Craig? What is Monty doing, man??"
"Torrey Craig, who started this year on the Bucks, is doing pretty well for the Suns."
Also traded that bum cash considerations for Torrey Craig.
"CP3 on the Suns is incredible though. This team is perfect for him, Booker is great off ball but can handle it when necessary, Ayton doesn't need the ball to make a huge impact defensively but can score when asked too. Great 3 and D players like Bridges, Crowder, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig. Also a solid backup pg in Payne. There's a reason he wanted to play in Phoenix"
"Torrey Craig with a team high +18, what a legend.  I loved watching that guy play for the Nuggets, you cant help but root for him."
"Torrey Craig really tries to do too much sometimes, and he misses like every gimme layup"
Torrey Craig just did that?!!? I don't even care that he missed.
Torrey Craig feeling himself  a little too much
TORREY CRAIG
"Torrey Craig has been so nice off the bench, quality minutes from this guy"
Lmao torrey craig with 5 in a hurry
"I don't see Saric playing many minutes in this series. What was that, and where the hell is Torrey Craig??"
INB4 Torrey Craig Paul George Spiderman meme.
"We also can go small if necessary with athletic good defensive wings: mikal, Jae, cam Johnson, and Torrey Craig. The jazz didn’t really have the personnel to do that"
I would feel pretty comfortable with Torrey Craig at center against the lineup the Clipper had out there.
The jazz are actually pretty slow and small on the perimeter. Books not a particularly great defender but he’s bigger than 3 of the jazz starters. Not to mention the jazz’s backup wing is niang while the suns have cam Johnson and Torrey Craig.
"Trading Conley is a bad idea he’s too talented.  They need to squeeze some value out of a vet min guy like a lot of teams do.  A backup 4 who’s a lot more playable than niang would be very nice.  A random wing would help too.  Some guys on market include harkless, Ariza, James Johnson, markieff and Torrey Craig"
They really should have gotten Torrey Craig this year. Guy was available for peanuts.  Pj tucker would have been nice too
"IMO they don’t need to do much. They need better wings. Bojan, Ingles, Clarkson while being great shooters absolutely let Gobert get exposed by being beat off the dribble every possesion and when rudy went into the paint to help, their rotations were nonexistent. Even Mitchell was guilty of this but Hes good enough offensively to where hes still a plus on the floor. IMO they need to better 3&amp;D players if they want to keep Mitchell &amp; Gobert together. They cant rely on bad on ball defenders funneling their man towards Rudy AND have dog shit rotations. They need more players like Royce and less like Ingles, Bojan. Someone like Mikal Bridges on the suns would be perfect for this team or maybe a Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig type.   We’ll see if I’m right next series though. Maybe the Suns get exposed in the same fashion."
"I dont think they should trade Clarkson, as he proved to be basically their entire bench production several times.  However, the Jazz are pretty much tied up cap-wise. I'd say, chase long 3&amp;D wings: Keita Bates Diop and Torrey Craig types. Otto Porter would be nice but hes injured too much and will still be expensive I think."
"25% Quin for not trying something else, 75% front office for not getting Quin the right kinds of pieces to try something else with.  Torrey Craig was available for cash. Instead, the Jazz got... Matt Thomas??"
"DA's going to be more effective guarding the perimeter and also guarding smaller players, as well more able to be more effective on offense (through lobs and post ups) to make the Clippers pay for going small.  Suns also have better plan B's for small ball 5's than what the Jazz had in Favors (not sure why Snyder didn't try O'Neale on Batum), as I think Jae and Torrey Craig would be better at that role than Favors.   Ayton is a good perimeter defender and good defender against smaller players for a guy his size. It's been a strength of his even since his rookie season, when he struggled as a whole on defense."
"Exactly. Monty has shown willingness to put Torrey Craig at the 5 and go small if need be, and it's worked in the past. I don't foresee Ayton being the liability LA turned Gobert into, but if he is having a rough game, a squad of CP3, Booker (odd man out as he isn't the defender the others are, though he has improved), Bridges, Crowder, and Craig is a phenomenal defensive and offensive lineup if the opposing team is going small."
And cam Payne and Jae crowder and Torrey Craig and Chris mother fucking paul
"lol Torrey Craig would never play as a small ball 5. Weird example, but I get your point. We have Ersan on the bench, but Quin is very committed to playing Favors and Niang, I guess."
"Yeah, I think a problem the Jazz have is they don't have someone who could play an effective small-ball 5 when needed. Someone like a Batum or a Torrey Craig."
And Mikals developement and Cam Payne and Cam Johnson and signing Jae Crowder and signing Torrey Craig
Favors and Niang have been awful. Makes me scared for Dario next series if we play the Clips. Might be better to just go small ball and throw Torrey Craig at back up center.
damn... torrey craig has been great so far too.  thats tough.  think we are gonna start seeing some nader in the near future.
Torrey Craig just wanna go home after that one lmao DAMN that's like getting trucked by Marshawn Lynch
Holy shit Torrey Craig got trucked
Torrey Craig?  More like Toreknee Craig.
When book barely swipes Pat it’s reviewed for a flagrant but Giannis can fuckin bulldoze Torrey Craig
"His name was Torrey Craig, jesus what a hit"
Bucks fans are such lowlifes for celebrating Torrey Craig getting injured
Former teammate from this year Torrey Craig lol
"That's the most ridiculous shit ever, obvious block on torrey craig, can't be tripping giannis like that"
bucks played thanasis over Torrey Craig when he was there lol
Torrey Craig now in his role as a tackling dummy
"Great job by Torrey Craig, but **fuck me** it is not a job I would do"
Torrey Craig died for that
Giannis just gave Torrey Craig the Roman Reigns special.
Hate to break it to you Bucks but a Torrey Craig 3 is the harbinger of death for the other team
Bucks better be happy with the cash they got for Torrey Craig
TORREY CRAIG
It felt like PG cooked everyone not named Torrey Craig to be fair
Torrey Craig! Didn’t the Ringer just excrete a terrible article in him?
Torrey Craig.
Torrey Craig?
"You're not wrong, but how hard could it be to start writing new storylines? It's just a matter of taking what happened in the past and applying it to the present.   Some storylines for a bucks-suns finals:  * CP3 first finals after not getting it done with two previous star-studded teams  * Booker and Ayton proving they are winning caliber players after years of losing and being painted as empty calorie players  * Giannis redeeming his MVP status after continued playoff disappointment  * Bucks almost traded for CP3 now they have to play against them  * Budenholzer rejected Phoenix as a candidate to coach them in 2018, now he has to coach against them  * Booker trying to live up to the ""next Kobe"" name  * Ayton was a 1st overall pick and providing 1st overall pick production (give him like 30% of the coverage that Zion Williamson got during a midday TNT game in February is all I'm asking for)  * Torrey Craig"
"Misses by player:  * Ayton, 12 (37 FTA) * Booker, 10 (125 FTA) * Paul, 5 (57 FTA) * Torrey Craig, 3 (9 FTA) * Crowder, 3 (23 FTA) * Bridges, 2 (18 FTA) * Jevon Carter, 2 (2 FTA) * Saric, 1 (14 FTA) * Payne, 1 (16 FTA) * Galloway, 1 (1 FTA)"
"And they could probably use Torrey Craig also while they're at it. Sure didn't seem like at the time, but that working relationship not panning out may very well cost the Bucks dearly. (No pun intended.)"
"Did it really come down to Craig vs. Tucker for that roster spot? I don't know if there was any roster CBA shenanigans going on but Torrey Craig is easily better than Mamadi Diakite, Jordan Nwora, and Sam Merrill who were all on the roster at the time. Maybe the salaries were important though to facilitate the Tucker trade though."
"Having watched the Suns all year, this comment rings so true. One of the reasons they play so consistently well is their role players know their role exactly — they don't have to figure anything out on the fly. When Torrey Craig comes in, he knows exactly where to go and what is expected of him. Same is true of Dario and the Cams. They play basically the same way game after game, running the same kinds of actions from the same spots and taking the same kinds of shots. It really allows them to come in off the bench and immediately find their groove."
"Yeah, Thanasis beat out Torrey for playing time during the regular season. It's not like we were really playing Torrey Craig anyway.  Also, whenever I would look at the box score for the suns after the trade, Torrey Craig always had the worst +/- on the team lol."
"This Torrey Craig revision is too much.  Yes, he's been good in Phoenix. Was he good with us? No.  We're not hurting for a 2.5 ppg player on 39/36/50 splits, especially not one getting outperformed by Thanasis in the rotation. The fact that we got cash for him is a victory (no, it's not worth it to just stash him at 11th from the bench, that's how you piss off players and alienate potential free agents).  The article also assumes that Thanasis plays the same role as Suns Torrey Craig, which... No? Is completely untrue?"
So is Torrey Craig one of the better backup small forwards in the league now? He's definitely earned his next paycheck.  He's gotta keep his shooting up too - shot 37% from 3 in the regular season this year. Promising.
Bradley Beal / Torrey Craig
"No way they let Cameron Payne walk. He’s way to important to their offense. As great as Torrey Craig had been for them, he’s the one they’ll let walk between the two."
"&gt;Kaminsky   Nope. Just more minutes to Torrey Craig, Cam Johnson and Cameron Payne which the Suns are fine with. They adjusted on the fly in Game 1 and it was pretty seamless."
If it's not Torrey Craig then I riot
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
"I hope he comes back healthy and can contribute, but if the result of him being out is that Torrey Craig plays more minutes... I'm pretty okay with that."
Bucks Torrey Craig was Heat Maurice Harkless level cheek
Bucks Torrey Craig was worse than Jeff Teague.
&gt; Also probably shouldn’t have cut Torrey Craig for Jeff Teague.  You wouldn't be saying this if you saw Bucks Torrey Craig.
Having DiVincenzo would help a lot. Also probably shouldn’t have cut Torrey Craig for Jeff Teague.
Torrey Craig fouled him
Center Torrey Craig because Monty was that fed up with Frank the Tank lol
Does Torrey Craig usually fall this often?
There’s been a shocking absence of “Torrey Craig may get a ring no matter who wins” from the booth
Please replace Mikal with Torrey Craig in the starting lineup. Mikal has been basically nonexistent since the 2nd round.
"Remember, this is the Torrey Craig vs Cash Considerations matchup first and foremost. The fact that it's the finals is just a bonus."
Torrey Craig revenge game babbbby
Impending NBA Champion Torrey Craig earning his ring
TORREY CASH CONSIDERATIONS CRAIG
A ring is a ring. No shame to it. If Suns lose and torrey craig is offered a ring he must accept. His grandchildren will love that story.
"Nah no Torrey Craig hate - pretty sure most Nuggets fans like him, I think he's liked with Suns fans, and he just played less than he is with us."
"I feel like everywhere I got lately I see Torrey Craig hate. Idk if it's warranted, I've never watched him much, but I think its funny."
He was actually a somewhat functional rotational player before the PJ trade.  Actually outplayed Torrey Craig in his time on the team.
*Torrey Craig has entered the chat*
"Yes, significantly. That said, don’t let Capela’s 6’10” deceive you, he plays like a 7-footer.  Also, there is a good chance Jae Crowder/Torrey Craig/Dario Saric end up guarding Lopez with DA assigned to Giannis."
They will 100% be keeping Lopez away from the paint on offense anyways when Ayton is in. It is the most effective strategy against us as our only rebounder aside from DA is Torrey Craig.
Putting Torrey Craig on him in game 6 worked well
Torrey Craig
Torrey Craig
"Gobert has his faults but his talents are wasted because the Jazz perimeter defenders were ass and couldn’t stop people from getting into the paint for free.   I love Gobert slander but the dude was let down by his team against the Clippers.   There’s a reason why Ayton didn’t look like shit vs the Clippers and it’s because Mikal, Jae, Cameron Johnson and Torrey Craig could actually stay in front of their man."
Torrey Craig for cash considerations.

Now I feel real bad for Eric Bledsoe.
That's NBA Champion Torrey Craig get it right
Does this mean Torrey Craig is guaranteed a ring?
Torrey Craig the opposite of Eric Bledsoe
Torrey Craig is the a poor man's Anderson Varejao
Congrats to NBA champion Torrey Craig
"Torrey ""American Varejao"" Craig"
Torrey Craig can now celebrate his NBA title
Torrey Craig is now a 2021 NBA Champion
I'll be able to sleep well tonight knowing Torrey Craig is getting a ring no matter who wins this finals.
"Definitely agree. But this Suns team added Chris Paul who’s playing as good as ever still, they added Jae Crowder, and even Torrey Craig has gotten some playoff minutes.   Still incredibly impressive"
"Yeah Ayton is the main guy who was underrated, but Cam Payne, Torrey Craig, and Cam Johnson have made our bench deadly as well as versatile and also weren't respected enough before the playoffs  The statistics OP uses are garbage though"
tyus jones  torrey craig
"Torrey Craig could be the first guy to get a ring for losing the finals lmao.     I kind of doubt we give him one (if we win) just on the basis of him being on the other team in the finals, it almost seems backhanded.  (Still nice to get a ring im sure but still)"
Don't give Torrey Craig one but DJ Wilson gets one.
Where do you have Torrey Craig all time with the ring?  I have him edging out Kosta Koufos for 856th all time
"While it’s true that he could get a ring either way, I’ve seen a ton of talk about “having rings” around here. Having a ring is actually meaningless. You don’t have to be a champion to have a ring.  Being a champion is what really matters. Not that Torrey Craig will be compared to all time greats, but nobody would call him a champion even if the bucks gave him a ring. At that point it’s just jewelry for the collection.  At the end of the day I just seem to see tons of people on here who care about rings, not championships. Who gives a fuck if drake has a ring or valanciunas doesn’t, neither is a champion."
"Two franchises that entered the league together, tied by the red string of fate when they had the coin flip for Kareem. The Bucks won and the Suns got Neal Walk instead.  PJ Tucker, former fan favorite Sun guarding the guy he would rave about in practice (Booker).  Bud and Monty, Bud chose the Bucks over the Suns in 2018.  Torrey Craig, discarded by the Bucks at the deadline, now a contributor on their finals opponent.   Jrue Holiday came to the Bucks in the Bledsoe trade. Bledsoe was only on the Bucks because of his famous “I don’t want to be here” tweet that happened at the nadir of the Suns’ history.  If Donte was healthy you’d have Donte and Mikal, former Villanova teammates now Finals rivals.  And then all of the narratives for individual players like CP3 chasing his first ring. Even without Giannis, the narratives are all there for a compelling series."
Torrey Craig vs Cash Considerations! The NBA finals! LIVE ON ABC!
"Oh shit Torrey Craig, I forgot that we got him from you guys. There’s another connection"
"Torrey Craig +28 , 30 mins.  Chris Paul - +22.  36 mins “PAY ME 40MIL!” -"
"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
Torrey Craig and Cam Payne as free mid season pickups is some goat executive shit
"A lot of credit to the Clippers for their overall hustle in this series. Their level of poise and execution was great, and if both teams are fully healthy, this probably goes 6-7 and the Clippers are favored.  Having said that, whenever the Suns could get out of their own way and run their normal offense instead of being shocked that the Clippers can play great defense, they got buckets every single time. Did it game 1, did it game 2 even if Book started off horribly then broke his nose, did it first half of game 4 before the Clippers (again, credit to them) rattled them with their great comeback, did it throughout game 6. They got little offensive contribution from their wings all series other than Cam and game 6 Crowder, so them having the firepower to do this is extremely encouraging for the Finals and future playoff runs. Also, Deandre fucking Ayton man. What a series for him. MVP of the Suns in the Western Conference fucking Finals, and what, a top 40 player in the league at this point?  If the Suns can be the Suns we know they are and have been all season, they're going to win their first NBA title. That's such an exciting sentence to me. When I saw the bracket I thought ""if they beat the Lakers they can make it out of the West"", but for it to actually happen is insane. I expected a 5th seed and a 2nd round run when the season started.  Thinking about what kind of champions these Suns are (and sorry for getting ahead of myself, when we know the opponent my thoughts will change instantly and become more nuanced in terms of the Suns' chances), seems like '04 Pistons or '19 Raptors. They have 3 top 40 guys, 2 top 20 guys (even if Kawhi was obviously a tier above), and two other above average starters plus a productive bench. They're winning by sheer force of being able to get productive minutes by all their lineups and their starting lineup rarely being beaten in its own right (at least when they started gaining chemistry around early February).  P.S. Shout out Marcus Morris, crazy good performance this series.  P.S. II: Torrey Craig cost 110K dollars."
Torrey Craig adding to his folklore as a PHX hero.
The decision to put Craig on him worked well. Torrey Craig made things hard for him tonight
"Torrey Craig did a number on the offensive glass. I'm glad Monty gave him as much minutes as he got tonight, but I wanna see those numbers up even"
Torrey Craig is the perfect kind of defender for PG too.
Torrey Craig needs some love for his defense on Paul. He was huge and didn't let Paul use his off arm. He needs more time.
Torrey Craig made one shot and had the highest +/- on the floor
"Torrey Craig just locked up the best player on the opposing team in a closeout game.  Role Players are crucial, especially if you don't have a superteam"
Torrey Craig
Torrey craig clamped up Paul George in an elimination game lol.
Can't wait for another Torrey Craig live!!!
Shoutout Torrey Craig. What a beast tonight +28 and locked PG down.
Torrey Craig with the clamps on PG13. Thanks Bucks!!
Is Torrey Craig really +28. Jesus
Torrey Craig been taking lessons from CP3
Dude Torrey Craig ain't getting a review get the hell outta here with that
Pat Beverly is awful in every way. He should slam his dick in a car door. Torrey Craig would fuck him up too lol.
"He was getting 9-10 minutes because early in the season he was outplaying Torrey Craig, and then when Giannis and PJ Tucker both got hurt right after the trade.  I like Thanasis as an energy 10th-12th man, but he should not be getting playoff minutes."
Man they could sure use that Torrey Craig guy
Torrey Craig lol. If Conley hits that shot I don’t know where I’d be rn.
Torrey Craig
"Not to give in to the obvious troll, but the Deandre Ayton has the best defensive rating on the team (109 tied with Torrey Craig per BBREF), highest defensive win shares (3.1), highest rebound rate and block rate, and a 54.3 DFG% (Embiid is at 53.9).  &amp;#x200B;  This is all on the #2 team in the league with the #6 defensive rating, and a lot of that defensive rating is anchored by Deandre Ayton's good decision making, rotations, and presence in the paint. If you watch a few games you can see it, plain as day, he has been a good defensive player for a while now."
Tired: Thanks Suns for TJ Warren for free  Wired: Thanks Bucks for Torrey Craig for free
Man was about to be out of the league and he’s balling out with Phoenix. Nice story for Torrey Craig

"Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder Cam Payne and Torrey Craig have all been great in addition to our big 3. You are disrespecting a damn good team by saying they'll be clapped. Chris Paul has been near MVP level, no way a team lead by him is an easy out"
"I hope you are right and I am wrong, but I see the Lakers unfortunately as the team as the best team suited to expose our paltry big man depth (beyond Ayton). AD, Harrell, Drummond, Gasol...Ayton's going to have to spend most of the time defending AD, and even though I am confident he can do a decent job (as much as you can ask for) in defending AD, he will rack up fouls and it will force Monty to have to play Kamisnky and Saric extended minutes in a playoff scenario. Not ideal.  Not to mention the aspect of playing against LeBron and AD as a young team with lack of playoff experience save for CP3, Jae and Torrey Craig.   I do think we can beat and compete with any other playoff teams in the West, obviously some like the Clippers less likely than others, but the Lakers are the one team IMO the Suns have no chance at beating.   Now I will say if there is a best time to play the Lakers, it is playing them in the first round when LeBron and AD aren't 100% yet. And if you think big picture, you likely have to get past the Lakers anyway to win the West. It would just suck to have a season like this end on a first round loss (even if it isn't a usual first round in that the Lakers as a 7th seed are the fakest 7th seed you can imagine) and heading into the future seasons with CP3 getting older and both Mikal and DA getting new deals (as much as they deserve the deals they are likely to get)."
Fuck the guy who ranked torrey craig as the 300th best player in the league at the start of the szn. I told you he should have been higher
Man Torrey Craig just has a nose for lose balls/offensive rebounds
Exhausted and Torrey Craig
Torrey Craig is a massive help to the team. Man hustles on every play and is right there in every major play.
How much did we get Torrey Craig for?
Torrey “Cash Considerations” Craig absolutely the X factor tonight
What an odd thing to fixate on  You a big Torrey Craig guy or something?
"Torrey Craig sittin at +21.  Dominating with all the glue plays, just like we all predicted."
Torrey “Cam “”Micheal Jordan”” Johnson” Craig.

Torrey craig is playing so well tonight
Remember when we got Torrey Craig for cash?
TORREY CRAIG CATAPULT
Torrey Craig playing excellent
Torrey Craig shoulda been starting this whole series
I LOVE TORREY CRAIG
Torrey craig is hustling this game
Just put Torrey Craig in already man
"I wasn’t exactly doing that, I just asked because TT told Torrey Craig he sucked."
"Every time Paul George goes to the bathroom, Torrey Craig is there waiting"
TT told Torrey Craig he was ass earlier in the season and I just remembered watching TC in the playoffs.
Thompson's salary is 5x Craig's. Is Thompson 5 times better than Torrey Craig?
TT told Torrey Craig he was ass earlier in the season and I just remembered watching TC in the playoffs.
No one stops pg except himself. Craig defended pg in that second half when he went off last game but I have to hear about Torrey Craig’s defense
"Need Mikal to show up in the second have he’s not even played good defense in this series, getting outplayed by Torrey Craig"
They call Torrey Craig the warden because he's got Wayoff P on lockdown.
#Keep Torrey Craig on Paul George the rest of the game
"Cant blame him, hes played his ass off all series. Not to mention torrey craig is clampin him right now too"
Good decision to keep Mikal's useless ass on the bench. Torrey Craig has been huge.
Torrey craig is clampin the shit out of pg13. Hes got him dribbling and chuckin 3s
Torrey Craig is doing a real good job on PG13
TORREY CRAIG IDC IF THAT DOESNT COUNT THATS A MANS OFFENSIVE REBOUND GOOD GOLLY MS MOLLY
I miss Torrey Craig.
"We need to just give Crowder's minutes to Torrey Craig, he has looked the best on PG this series"
Torrey Craig has been the best defender on Paul George since his Nuggets days. He makes it really difficult on him &amp; PG can’t use his strength advantage.  In this series he’s shooting now 2/9 against Craig and 0/5 from three.
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
"Exactly, wtf. Then they fail to call a flagrant on PG when he shoves Torrey Craig to the ground on a FT, but make sure to call a flagrant on Crowder for grazing PG’s face on a routine closeout. What a fucking ridiculously officiated game"
"Why is Torrey Craig not playing more minutes than Crowder? Crowder has been such a negative to the Suns this series. Bad attitude, shit offense, too emotional. Craig stinks on offense but the dude is a dog on defense"
Chats moving so fast nobody will see I have a life size blowup doll of Torrey Craig
Lol at JVG trying to gas up Torrey Craig. Dude made a layup and got a rebound
Torrey Craig isnt a real NBA player
"Torrey Craig made the finals last year and he is on his way to make it again this year, he is in that goat discussion 😂🐐"
