"29th ranked offense didn't have Sexton, Garland, Windler, Prince, Allen, and Love but he's still missing. Bickerstaff was forced to play Dotson and Cedi at point and Dean Wade, Marques Bolden, Thon Maker, and Lamar Stevens had to play more minutes than they're supposed to. I'd be surprised if you know who those players are aside from Thon."
"At the start of the play, Zion is on Kyle Guy (UVA #5), Marques Bolden (Duke #20) is on Jay Huff (UVA #30), and RJ Barrett (Duke #5) on Hunter (UVA #12). Huff sets the pick to get Zion off Guy. Bolden then switches onto off Huff onto Guy, but Zion stays on Guy. In a typical pick and roll situation, the defender guarding the ball handler (Zion on Guy) and the defender guarding the screener (Bolden on Huff) switch after the screen is executed. Zion not switching onto Huff forces Barrett to switch onto Huff. That means he abandons Hunter, who's free to run to the three point line, leaving him open for the extra pass. The defensive recovery onto a guy who wasn't his man was great, but he only had to recover because of the initial error. OP asked why a player who was so good on defense in college and high school has struggled in the pros; it's because you can't pull off that kind of recovery in the NBA, so all that's left is the first error.   **Here's where, watching it again, I could have made a mistake**: I initially assumed Zion/Bolden were supposed to switch, but it could be that they were supposed to blitz Guy and the defensive strategy just failed. In that case, it's more of a blown play because of tactics, and not because of anything Zion did- not his fault at all."
"Dean Wade, Marques Bolden and probably Delly"
"Lmao you’re looking at NBA . Coms advanced stats and DJ is at #249 but the top 5 players are Greg Whittington, Marques Bolden, Ashton Hagans, Aminda Brimah, Kostas Antenkounmpo  Also according to your stats you’re looking at Spencer Dinwiddie is the best defender in the league   Good one bud"
"Not even the 5 stars are considered locks in my mind. I know you said that but I definitely wanted to emphasis it. Running off the UNC example, think of joel berry or armando bacot. Look at Duke and marques bolden or trevon duval. I think there are a lot more highly rated high school prospects that don’t make it to the league than people realize"
