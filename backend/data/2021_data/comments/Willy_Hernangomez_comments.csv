Willy Hernangomez and Wenyen Gabriel aka Quadruple U
"I'd recommend the Pels as one. Not just because they're the team I support.  Do you like big comebacks, well if you watch the Pels, you'll see it happen at least once a week as the team blows a 20+ point lead.  You like young players? Zion &amp; Ingram are right there.   You like ""funny"" players? Adams is a well-known one, but Josh ""6'5 Center"" Hart and Willy Hernangomez are both incredibly underrated on that front.   And they aren't contenders, but the team still has a chance to make the play-in, so the games do still matter."

"Josh Hart, Willy Hernangomez and Ron Baker"
Youre right. Make Willy Hernangomez the CEO.
"He's a TV personality, isn't being likeable the most important part of the job?  And I doubt fans want to hear their analysis of Willy Hernangomez, but when it's a dude who's the best player on his team and has a ring and am MIP, you would expect shaq to know him."

Lonzo Ball &amp; Willy Hernangomez
"BI, Zion, and Lonzo (as of lately) are fine pieces. Adams has been good this year as well. Bledsoe is either the best shooter on the court, or he’s a non factor. His defense has also taken a step back. Our main issues comes with the bench. The bench is just awful. We have no reliable scorer coming off the bench. Arguably our best bench players are Hart and Willy hernangomez. Kira has looked good, but it’s too soon."
Can we talk about how Willy Hernangomez put up a double double too? Have we finally found a backup big man?
Getting me a Willy Hernangomez jersey
"Part of it has to do with how bad the bench bigs have been. I mean, just the fact that Willy Hernangomez has been a significant improvement says a lot, and not in a good way.  I think with this tweaked role and if you get continued defensive activity from Zion, they should revisit some Zion at C stuff for bench units.  But Adams is clearly important overall."

"They won't really move the needle, but you can also add Willy and Juancho Hernangomez for some more depth"
Willy Hernangomez is nice as fuck
We could have kept Christian Wood on the roster for around 13m so it really makes no sense. Give me Christian/Jax/Willy Hernangomez any day.
Our other center Willy Hernangomez is only like a year younger than Adams but looks like a baby standing next to him.

"Willy Hernangomez did the following things in the final 7 minutes of the 4th quarter and OT: 8 rebounds (4 offensive rebounds,) 2 clutch free throws, game-tying shot in regulation and a clutch  steal in the final minute of OT to essentially seal the win.   Zion (38/9/8/1/1 on 14/17 shooting) and Lonzo (33/11/8/3) will grab the headlines for this game, but Willy was really clutch and deserves to be lauded for his heroics too."

"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
"Also, Adams made $25M more than Willy Hernangomez this year. Is there really that big of a difference between what those two bring to the floor?"
"Spain starts with Rubio, Abrines, Juan Hernangomez, Mirotic, and Gasol with Willy Hernangomez and Ibaka off the bench."
"Wasn't he great friends with Willy Hernangomez? And KOQ? And he got along well with THJ, Frank and Enes as well"
Apparently he told Willy hernangomez (KPs best friend) “tell your friend to stop playing like a pussy”.

"He was kind of a disaster at the beginning of the year. If they didn't have Adams it would have been a disaster. He even got knocked out the rotation for a few weeks in favor of Willy Hernangomez. But he really made an impact when he made his way back in. The defense switching to a drop scheme definitely helped him, just being able to keep everything in front of him. And he had a bit more of a green light to do stuff offensively with the injuries going on. Even had a 3/3 shooting game from 3 lol."
1. Willy Hernangomez 2. J.J. Hickson 3. Chinanu Onuaku
"76ers were locked in as a 35~ win team after the Bynum trade destroyed them and Jrue was going to demand a max. So because he was all star caliber they flipped him for Noel and a first. Then traded the first for 2 firsts(Saric, Shamet) and a second(Willy Hernangomez). That 76ers team sucked hard and was boring so there wasn't any real national buzz around him until the trade."
Brook and Robin Lopez Willy and Jauncho Hernangomez Paul and Marc Gasol
"15. should be Willy ""Billy"" Hernangomez"
Willy Hernangomez bring him home!
"Serbia has Jokic, Bogdanovic, Bjelica, Boban and Pokusevski.   Spain has Marc, Rubio, Juancho Hernangomez, Willy Hernangomez and Garuba (top 15 prospect).   France has Gobert, Fournier, Batum, Hayes, Ntilikina, Doumbouya, Maledon...  Australia has also some NBA players.  The best national teams have around half of their players in the NBA."
"Sato is a consistent player who can do everything on the court, he’s been underrated all offseason  Jones was a bad backup point guard last year and Kira is also a better defender  Naji is a good defender, playmaker, can shoot the 3 ball at a solid rate, and can attack the basket well. Similar to Kyle but more pleasing to watch  Billy is Willy hernangomez  Just face it, our depth is better than whatever Memphis is doing  Graham is a pretty good point guard, he was just put into a logjam. He won’t be in that position this year"
"Yeh, he was outplayed by Pau and Willy hernangomez on his own team. Not a good sign."
Jaden and jalen mcdaniels. Juancho and willy hernangomez.
This would literally leave the Pelicans with Jaxson Hayes and Willy Hernangomez at centre.
"They still boost heights lol. Willy Hernangomez is listed at 6’11. I’m 6’5 and stood next to him. He’s gotta be 6’9 at best, prob closer to 6’7 or 8"
Ex all rookie player Willy Hernangomez
Top remaining centers:    Ed Davis	  Enes Kanter  Frank Kaminsky	  Hassan Whiteside	  Willy Hernangomez	  Isaiah Hartenstein	  DeMarcus Cousins
"I'm a spanish fan myself, and yes, I haven't seen Marc playing as expected.   Almost no 3pt shooting, not many high post plays despite how strong he is there. Marc didn't play well in the olympics, but with him being at this level, i'd put Willy Hernangomez over him (even when I admit he needs to step up in almost every aspect)"
Willy Hernangomez outplayed him too
Hernangomez outplayed him like Willy is the NBA star
Willy Hernangomez is gonna get PAID after this performance
Knicks legend Willy Hernangomez
And prime Mutombo in the form of Willy Hernangomez.
Willy Hernangomez
knicks and hornets legend willy hernangomez THANK YOU
You know if team USA got beat by Luka going insane I wouldn’t mind it. But to get destroyed by Victor Claver and Willy Hernangomez? Yea that unacceptable
Willy “Wilt” Hernangomez
That's NBA vet Willy Hernangomez
Willy 'Mutumbo' Hernangomez! Let's go!
Hernangomez showing why his name is Willy
Fuck it. Put JaVale in. I'm tired of seeing Willy Hernangomez getting easy tip ins over Jrue.
I thought Willy Hernangomez played well enough this year to make it to this list.
"It's kind of crazy because this year we had Willy Hernangomez come off the bench and on limited minutes had 11 double-doubles!  JV an even more suped-up version of that is just gonna straight up thrive off Zion/BI feeds, but add in Lowry feeds and it's *ridiculous.*"
"PG: Curry SG: SGA SF: Kyle Anderson PF: Giannis C: Boucher  Bench: Haliburton, TJ McConnell, PJ Tucker, Aron Baynes, Trevor Ariza, Reggie Jackson, Jordan Poole, Maurice Harkless, Chuma Okeke, Willy Hernangomez"
Australia vs Spain.  Giddey vs Willy Hernangomez
"There have also never been less offensive rebounds per game than there is today. 86-87 was Chuck's peak OREB year. There were 14.7 OREBs per game on average, and Barkley brought in 5.7 of them. Last season there was 9.8 a game and Zion grabbed 2.7.  Interestingly enough the Sixers team he was on was under the league average in OREBs (14.4), conversely the Pelicans last year lead the league in OREBs at 11.7 a game, Adams grabs 3.7 of them, Zion 2.7, and Willy Hernangomez 2.5.   Capela was the lead leader with 4.7 which is pretty surprising to me considering the Hawks are at the bottom of the league in FA and middle of the league in FG%.  I think all of that points to four major things things.   One is that Charles is just an all time elite offensive rebounder. One of the best of all time.   Another is that Zion is on a team with an elite offensive rebounder in Adams, and another above average one in Willy. So even if Zion could go grab 4-5 a night the opportunity is probably taken by the other two often enough, and he can spare his body the extra jumps.  Thirdly I imagine the steady year-by-year decrease in OREBs has a lot to do with the increased 3pt rate creating longer rebounds that end up with the guards and the decreased rate of contested paint shots/paint packing.   Lastly the rest of it probably has to do with scheming. Box outs, rebound philosophy, transition, etc. You see a lot more of centers boxing out for the guards to grab the rebounds now than you used to a-la Brook Lopez, centers with Westbrook, etc."
Yeah he is looking like great value at the 16th pick but I see him more as a high floor low ceiling guy with a player like Sabonis being his ceiling and Willy Hernangomez his floor
Tae is Devonte Graham  TM3 is understandable but it’s not like you’d know if I said Murphy since he’s a rookie   Willy hernangomez goes by Billy
"I mean Stan also basically insisted on playing multiple bigs together. Like when Zion went out he started Jaxson Hayes at the 4 alongside Steve Adams. I know the roster was limited, but still. There was a game in Philly where he went to a lineup with Zion, James Johnson, Willy Hernangomez, AND Steve Adams.  That all being said, I don’t think most of the failing were schematic."
"Don't really think the Holiday trade is a problem...we shipped him out once we knew we could get Noel who many thought was the #1 pick, and also got a future first (traded for Saric). Very defensible trade.  Hinkie's drafting is really quite strong thought tbh, he was just in an awful bind a couple of times  MCW at 11 (bargain) which he sold high on  Nerlens at 6  Jerami Grant at 39  Embiid at 3  Saric at 12  Reportedly (unconfirmed) wanted Porzingis at 4 but was squashed by ownership and Porzingis' management. Okafor obviously sucked but go look at that draft and tell me the correct selection at 3.  Willy Hernangomez at 35  Holmes at 37  Not to mention the undrafted guys he signed"
I feel like we should've given Willy Hernangomez some minutes this game but I don't hate giving Jax more minutes against great big men
"&gt; And getting Saric and Noel for Jrue Holiday was not a great use of the assets Hinkie inherited.  They got Noel and Elfrid Payton. Payton got swapped for 3 picks(Saric, Shamet, Willy Hernangomez)"
Willy Hernangomez was also his teammate in Charlotte and said he knew 100% he was making it in the post-game lol
