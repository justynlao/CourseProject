Pretty sure Juancho Hernangomez has played more than 3 games
"You're right about them needing time adusting. Since last season they've literally played 5 games together. They win their first two games of this season against the Pistons and Jazz but then KAT is out because of a wrist injury. KAT comes back like a week and a half later but it's for only one game. Now he has COVID. All this constant on and off will always makes things difficult.   As for your starting lineup comment:  Dlo - 2nd best player  Malik Beasley - 3rd best player  Josh Okogie - He was out for some time but he may be the Twolves' best defender.  Juancho Hernangomez - Probably the worst starting PF in the league. This guy sucks.  KAT - Best player but has been out more games than he's played.   Another significant problem with the team is the coach. He is arguably the worst coach in the NBA..although Scott Brooks maybe takes he cake. Ryan Saunders is so intent on playing Dlo with Rubio, trying to mimic the Rockets' small ball but without the personnel. Oh Rubio can't play? No problem, let's play Dlo with another PG.   Given the circumstances Dlo is actually playing well. Shooting 40% from 3 on high volume and he's actually playing the best defense this season compared to his other seasons."
One Lock of Tyrese Maxey’s hair for Juancho Hernangomez?
"Well, he's in contact with other players every day and night. They don't wear masks when they're playing, and Hernangomez also tested positive. So he could have gotten it from Juancho, or from an opponent. Or from a trainer, or a coach, or maybe it had to do with Delta Airlines not forcing its crew to get tested.  My point is, you can be as safe as you want as an NBA player, but that's no guarantee you won't get sick."
that's juancho hernangomez

"As we all predicted was a battle of super stars Juancho Hernangomez and Nikola Jokic, in the end Juancho came out a bit short.  Next time!"
"Pardon me, do you have a little time to talk about our Lord and saviors juancho hernangomez and Jared Vanderbilt?"
Jarred Vanderbilt and Juancho Hernangomez turned into max players obviously.
"Jarret Culver, Juancho Hernangomez, Ed Davis, M. Beas, and DLo starting tonite.  Oh god, my stomach churns just thinking about Juancho starting. I just hope he starts playing better soon. Otherwise, we might as well put A1 in his spot."
someone please fucking take juancho hernangomez
Juancho Hernangomez but you guys have to throw a second rounder in.
Jarrett Culver + Juancho Hernangomez + Filler for Aaron Gordon
yeah maybe he’s not just good he has had so many elite teammates like Treveon Graham Jeff Teague josh okogie Juancho Hernangomez Taj Gibson Jake Layman and more.
It's crazy to think Bradley Beal scores more than Juancho Hernangomez.
Well you don't see articles regarding what Juancho Hernangomez cna bring to the Timberwolves after recovering from covid do you?  And there is a difference since Joel Embiid is a superstar who people do care about and him changing his conditioning can impact his entire team and with that the conference while this is just a post about an out of rotation player maybe coming into the rotation.
Juancho Hernangomez
I see your Juancho Hernangomez and raise you one Jarrett Culver
"They won't really move the needle, but you can also add Willy and Juancho Hernangomez for some more depth"
Juancho Hernangomez is legit one of the worst player I've ever seen lmao
Juancho Hernangomez just put up 19 pts on 7/10 shooting last night and I will lose zero sleep if he gets bought out and signs with the Nets
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"People in the nuggets subreddit still complain every other day that we traded Juancho Hernangomez, so probably him. It's amazing how beloved a guy who averaged 5 points on 42% from the field is."
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"He did hit the open man out of doubles.  That open man was Ricky fucking Rubio, Josh Okogie, Jared Vanderbilt and Juancho Hernangomez.    DLo, Beasley and McDaniels were out.  They can hit open shots.  Miami only guarded KAT and Ant to close the game."
"I know using the refs as an excuse is a frowned upon thing or whatever, but I just don't care. I mean, calling a tech on finch, then a tech on rubio? And then 2 on dlo ejecting him?? Half the fouls on kat were horrible, which meant he was in foul trouble most of the 2nd half... that 5th on kat was BAD. Jimmy Butler straight up shoved Juancho Hernangomez away from a rebound with no call. Ugh, it's so frustrating. Dlo in the 4th would've been huge"
Something funny to wake up to....    &gt; Anthony Edwards says he's going to Spain with Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez this summer.    &gt;Says he's gonna learn fluent spanish so he knows what those two are talkin about all the time.
His other quote tonight has me cracking up as well.  &gt; Anthony Edwards says he's going to Spain with Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez this summer.    &gt;Says he's gonna learn fluent spanish so he knows what those two are talkin about all the time.
dont forget juancho hernangomez
Yep. Last night our starters were playyed off the floor in the first half. It got to a point where Juancho Hernangomez had 12 points whilst all the starters together had 11
Much easier to get assists passing to Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward than Josh Okogie and Juancho Hernangomez. Just saying.....
The only person who is worse at shooting fts than Giannis in the NBA is Juancho Hernangomez.
Kuzma is better than Juancho Hernangomez that's why
We're just going to act like Juancho Hernangomez doesn't exist? Smh
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
"Hell, Poeltl, Juancho Hernangomez, Malik Beasley, Zubac, Niang all would have been better picks than the guys they took"
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
"Idk, probably one where you’re asking dame to carry Jarrett culver, okogie, juancho hernangomez, Naz Reid, to the finals with only KAT as the help and no first round picks left or roster flexibility… so, nah."
"Serbia has Jokic, Bogdanovic, Bjelica, Boban and Pokusevski.   Spain has Marc, Rubio, Juancho Hernangomez, Willy Hernangomez and Garuba (top 15 prospect).   France has Gobert, Fournier, Batum, Hayes, Ntilikina, Doumbouya, Maledon...  Australia has also some NBA players.  The best national teams have around half of their players in the NBA."
Hey sixers fans want juancho hernangomez and jarret culver?
"Even if it goes the absolute worst, that's still 3 picks. We drafted Jamal Murray, Juancho Hernangomez and Malik Beasley with almost those exact picks"
"For sure. KAT has gotten better at defense the last few years but there's still obvious deficiencies that a good defensive 4 can help with, and having your PF be Juancho Hernangomez does him absolutely no favors. Simmons would genuinely be huge for this team"
"Grizzlies under 42 is the easiest bet out there.   They made the playoffs narrowly, and then simultaneously took a big step backwards by trading their fringe all star center for a below average one, their starting shouting guard for a reserve, and trading a good backup point guard for a bust and Juancho Hernangomez  Ja gonna have to shoot 40% from 3 for them to have a shot at the playoffs next year"
I know what they did… which is not much to improve the team. Traded for Bledsoe and then traded him away for Bev who they traded for Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez. Downgraded from JV to Adams
"&gt;Yeah but only one of those players the offense runs around is an MVP who's won heavily in the both the regular season and the playoffs.   One of the players didn't play most of the season with Josh Okogie,Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez as his shooters."
Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez
"Half of the roster were expiring over the hill vets that needed to be replaced when he took over. We also had no cap space which we could have used on better FA's.  &gt;And if no FA wants to sign with us, maybe we should try to focus on treating our guys right instead of pissing them off and letting them run free.  No FA wants to sign with us because the team is bad and the team is in Minnesota not because of Juancho fucking Hernangomez lol."
Juancho Hernangomez sounds like two people who have fused together to become the ultimate player. Is this legal in the NBA? Has it been investigated?
Juancho Hernangomez........nice
"&gt; Mods need to censor this  Mods were deleting posts of this trade for some reason, not sure why  &gt; Juancho ""Adam Sandler's least favorite basketball player coworker"" Hernangomez  Juancho is literally in a movie with Adam Sandler coming out later this year, and I'm assuming that Adam does not like Juancho as much as he likes Shaq and KG."
Juancho Hernangomez 💯 sounds like a made-up name
Who is Juancho Hernangomez
"Mods need to censor this, the league cannot know that the Grizzlies have acquired Juancho ""Adam Sandler's least favorite basketball player coworker"" Hernangomez."
"Tbh a trade with San Antonio that sends them Culver, Hernangomez and seconds for Thad Young makes the most sense. In this scenario we don't give up Vando, Naz doesn't have to move positionally and we get a lot better because Culver has shown next to nothing and Juancho is not that good nor does it feel like his relationship with the team is reparable at this point"
The Nets vs Cavs game that went to double(?) OT with Sexton going HAM was great.  Worst play nomination: Juancho Hernangomez airballing a wide open layup
I agree but his average defensive impact would hurt the team a lot less if there was a good defensive minded PF to play next to him. KAT being neutral to slight positive on D isn't good enough when his frontcourt partner is Juancho Hernangomez
Jaden and jalen mcdaniels. Juancho and willy hernangomez.
Here is what I'd be willing to give up but idk about other Wolves fans. I'd give up:  Malik Beasley Jaden Mcdaniels Juancho Hernangomez 2 first round picks.  That would be the highest I'd probably go.
Might we tempt you with Juancho Hernangomez and Jarrett Culver?
That big trade? Juancho Hernangomez for Derrick Favors.
"We, the Wolves, certainly haven't. It's more a product of our minimal cap space but we made a lateral move healthy for depth across the roster and hope to resign our &lt;7$$ per year role guys (who can be legitimately impactful at times). Not a lot of upside in terms of creative roster building, as our assets seem kinda mismatched in regards to the guys it would make sense to bring in to our roster.   The upside is even our fringe rotational guys have a fair amount of upside going into the season. Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, Jarred  Vanderbilt, (Nathan Knight?), Juancho Hernangomez are all guys that could credibly play better next year than last. How much better is unknown. I personally believe Malik Beasley's play will make GMs reassess his value more highly. Also we're still just riding the high of Anthony Edwards, so life could be worse."
We have a slightly broken Juancho Hernangomez. We will even toss in Culver....
"Kevin ""Juancho ""Matisse Thybulle"" Hernangomez"" Durant"
Okay well we need to send you 11m. We can only do that by sending you Josh Okogie - whos a phenomenal on ball defender and a solid cutter as well as one of Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez. Juancho will shoot well but nothing else. Culver will defend well and probably wont do much else
Tobias might have a big contract but I'd still take it in a heartbeat (depending on what we have to send to Philly) because Tobias on 30 million is still far more useful than Juancho Hernangomez and Taurean Prince
"over juancho fucking hernangomez, yes"
"The Rosas special: Juancho ""movie star"" hernangomez - 7m a year to ride the pine. Vando, on paper one of the best defenders in the NBA - yeah you can walk"
Juancho Hernangomez
"You want Juancho Hernangomez? I don't even need anything back, just freeing up the cap space would be enough for me."
The lack of one of the Hernangomez in the team is a sore spot too. I like Willie a lot but Juancho is kind of a must have at this point.
"There’s still a ton of non-star NBA players in international teams right now.   Satoransky, Ntilikina, Batum, Luwawu-Cabarot, Fournier, Mills, Josh Green, Ingles, Thybulle, Exum, Baynes, Bonga, Wagner, Mannion, Gallinari, Melli, Okpala, Metu, Oni, Okafor, Okogie, Vincent, Nwora, Achiuwa, Campazzo, Deck, Vildoza, Hachimura, Cancar, Rubio, Marc Gasol and Juancho Hernangomez are all at the Olympics and on NBA rosters right now. That’s 32 guys who aren’t stars providing depth. Plus a bunch of guys who were very recently on NBA teams (Pau Gasol, Poirier, Abrines, Delly etc).   And there’s a bunch of others from countries that just didn’t make it. Depth is fine."
Remember when we used to talk about actual basketball here? Like how great the offense was that the warriors ran in 2015? Now we have top posts about fuckin juancho hernangomez who is a bench player on one of the worst teams in the NBA. This place has fallen so far it's not even funny
"Ok fair, I looked up his injury. Juancho Hernangomez has a grade 4/5 left shoulder dislocation and it's from 2 weeks ago. I understand why they won't clear him. Bit of a problem for management that he is already in Japan as part of the contingent.  https://dunkingwithwolves.com/2021/07/09/minnesota-timberwolves-juancho-hernangomez-suffers-serious-shoulder-injury/"
"&gt; Hernangomez suffered a grade 4-5 acromioclavicular dislocation in his left shoulder during a prep game against France early in July. While it was initially announced that he’ll miss Olympics, he he made a progress in his recovery that allowed him to travel to Tokyo with the rest of the national team.  I’m not mad at the wolves for this, at the end of the day the team wants to prioritize his health and Juancho may be pushing to play ahead of rehab schedule."
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
 The Dunn and Edwards for Juancho Hernangomez trade.
He did a movie with Juancho Hernangomez last summer as well. Juancho missed all of training camp because of it and then played like ass all season.
"You joke, but he is actually making a movie with Juancho Hernangomez about a washed up talent scout who finds a high-caliber prospect in Europe and tries to get him into the NBA"
Juancho Hernangomez
Yup. Got him from Memphis for Culver and Hernangomez. Juancho got waived and JC is the 15th man. Absolute W.  Came in and immediately got to changing the culture. The defence looks incredible now and all the players and coach Finch have attributed that to him
somehow Juancho Hernangomez of all people managed to survive the last few days of training camp/preseason purge over Jabari Parker X_X
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"Nobody has to believe me on this cause I have no proof but I met a guy at a bar in Philly where Adam Sandler is filming his next movie, who was one of the body doubles for the movie  It’s about an NBA agent and among the players involved is Anthony Edwards. He specifically said that Ant is an extremely cool and funny dude. Also the main player in the movie is played by Juancho Hernangomez who apparently has acting chops"
"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
"“Ime Udoka will start Juancho Hernangomez at power forward tonight next to Smart, Tatum, Brown and Robert Williams. Udoka said the Celtics know what they have in Horford and want to look at some different combinations.”  “Coach Udoka says he plans on limiting our veteran players to about 24 minutes tonight.”"
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
juancho hernangomez would like a word
"there’s been a lot of DLO haters the last couple years, but people are starting to come around.  mfers haaaaaaaated Juancho Hernangomez last year and that was well deserved lol.  Right now things are going good and there’s very little hate, but people recognize that Jordan Mclaughlin is a bit of weak link out there. Smart backup point guard that makes good decisions so hard to hate him but he just doesn’t do much out there, and the resentment is starting to build as the team as always does a bit worse with him on the court"
"Well yeah...   If your entire premise is ""he didn't play a single minute until his tweet about being silenced"" and then it turns out he had played and been so disappointing he got cut from the rotation then most sensible people would consider your original point ""full of shit"".  OP said twice that Kanter hadn't played a single minute until his tweet.  We weren't silencing Kanter in the same way we weren't silencing Juancho Hernangomez."
Jarrett culver and juancho hernangomez
for jarrett culver and juancho hernangomez😭😭  and then they traded juancho too lmfao
Juancho Hernangomez and jarrett culver
Celtics can trade Juancho Hernangomez and there are high chances that Lebron or Anthony Davis will end up being a Celtic this season  I like this game
"Joe's Harris shot 47.4% from 3 that year. Closest player to that KAT has ever had is Beasley, who he's hardly played with yet.   Dinwiddie averaged 16 ppg on above average efficiency. Backup or not, still a legit NBA player. Not some scrub.   Allen and Davis both very strong rebounders and good presence at the rim on defense, as well as great lob threats. Davis had a 25% rebound %, which is nuts. Embiids highest for a season was 22%.   Levert, don't really need to jump into that. Good scorer.   My point here, being, Russell had good players to play with all at once that year. Towns, hasn't had that except that one year, and surprise! He made the playoffs.   Towns has maybe played with guys as good as the ones I've listed, but never at the same time. A lot of his career he's had to play with guys like Treveon Graham, Culver, Wiggins, Teague, Shabazz Mohammed, Kris Dunn, Jerryd Bayless, Anthony Tolliver, Juancho Hernangomez, and a bunch of other rookies, sophomores, or dudes who aren't in the league anymore."
Hawks get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Juancho Hernangomez (filler)  Celtics get:   * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * John Collins  * Cam Reddish  Hawks end up with the best player overall. Celtics turn two really good players into three really good players.   Hawks run Trae/Brown/Huerter/Hunter/Capela  Celtics run Smart/Bogdanovic/Tatum/Collins/Horford with Cam Reddish off the bench
