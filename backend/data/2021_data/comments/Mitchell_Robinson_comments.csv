I just traded Mitchell Robinson and Khris Middleton for him in fantasy. Thanks Taco!
Mitchell Robinson
"allen is good for his age but just because he's a breakout player doesn't make him better. ayton is debatable but drummond actually plays most of the season so i give him the edge. mitchell robinson is a straight up no. theis is amazing for his size and a good shooter but no. capela maybe but it doesn't matter, drummond is still top 5."
"Mitchell Robinson, Damyean Dotson, IQ are all rotation players taken 25 or in the second round. Trier isn‚Äôt bad either, i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs just an insufferable douche and nobody wants him. Knicks do a decent job with their later picks. i‚Äôm usually more confident in those."
2017-Frank Ntilikina 8th may be out of the league soon  -Daymeon Dotson 44th Solid rotational player for the Cavs   2018 Kevin Knox 9th Barely getting minutes on our team  -Mitchell Robinson 36th our franchise center   2019 RJ Barrett (exception)
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokiƒá - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
Ya idk what bro is talking about Reggie got assaulted by Mitchell Robinson and they didn‚Äôt call anything
They made up a call right after when Mitchell Robinson bear hugged Reggie Jackson on a drive. Refs going to miss obvious.
"Mitchell Robinson won't make an All-Defensive team over Embiid, Gobert and Myles Turner dude..."
Mitchell Robinson doesn‚Äôt meat the 500 fga minimum. Which OP didn‚Äôt list but is in the source tweet
"Not that Robinson lmao  Mitchell Robinson who is fairly famous for his FG% and blocks  OP didn't specify they had to average 20ppg, he just said highest FG for first 40 games."
You can tell players are scared to go up on Mitchell Robinson
Also he's doing this starting next to Elfrid Payton who cannot shoot for shit and Mitchell Robinson who cannot shoot for shit. He's a primary slasher who has to constantly deal with a packed paint and zone defense every night and has looked great the last 10 games or so doing it. Imagine what he could do with some floor spacing.

"Even a quick glance at bpm for last year shows a ton of discrepancies that are pretty irreconcilable.   For example: Steven Adams, Bradley Beal, Montrezll Harrell, and Mitchell Robinson all have a 2.9 bpm and that's a wide range of player value right there. They all have a lower bpm than Whiteside, and from what I heard he wasn't positive value for Portland last year. It's full of stuff that contextually makes no sense. Jaylen Brown had a 0.8 bpm while Hayward had a 2.7, Smart had a 1.4, Tatum had a 4.0, and Kemba topped them off at a 4.6. Not only is that wrong, I'd go so far as to say it's pretty much completely off in terms of which players played the best and which players had the most impact"
"That's awesome that you think that considering he plays 72% of his minutes with Mitchell Robinson and 19% with Nerlens Noel, our actual centers."
I was really surprised they didn't call at least a loose ball foul on the over-the-back play from Mitchell Robinson. Head-locking a guy while falling like that can cause a serious neck/spinal injury. A no-call that honestly could have been called a flagrant two.
"I got yelled at in the game thread for saying that the Knicks were playing dangerous basketball last night. Donovan got a bloody nose last night and Mitchell Robinson put him in a headlock.   I love physical play, and I don‚Äôt blame the players either. It‚Äôs clear that they applied the Jordan rules to one of the league‚Äôs rising stars last night, but refs have to step in when a guy is going to get hurt. They didn‚Äôt, the hyper-physical play went on, and now we‚Äôre here."
The Mitchell Robinson over the back rebound is what I thought of first. He got hit a few times last night.
Mitchell Robinson is just Robert Williams with more minutes (and less injury prone)  Per 100 possessions:  * Robinson: 15.3 pts / 14.1 reb / 0.8 ast / 2.0 stl / 2.8 blk / 1.2 TO / 4.5 PF / .641 TS% * Williams: 18.3 pts / 18.5 reb / 2.0 ast / 2.5 stl / 4.8 blk / 3.7 TO / 4.2 PF / .732 TS%

Nobody else talks about it but I really want Mitchell Robinson. I don‚Äôt know what the knicks would take though.
"Curry will likely retire at number 1, but Harden has a verrrry outside chance to break it just by nature of being big and skilled enough to play close to 20 years even after his athleticism dips. (Prob not tho if Steph puts up 3 or 4 more good years). Outside of that, \*IMO\* no one in the league right now has the ability to break it.  The Beal/McCollumn/Mitchell tier just don't have the touch Steph has (nor the teams to get them deeper in the playoffs) and shooting specialists like Robinson/Hield/Markannan just simply won't get the touches.  Trae is a wild card, but  shorter guys don't usually have a long enough shelf life in this league to even have the chance to break Steph's (eventual) record."
"Mitchell Robinson. Still learning to stay out of foul trouble but make no mistake he‚Äôs no jumping jack like DAJ, McGee, etc. He could be ferrari Gobert"
Robinson is 2 years older then mitchell
"I watched the Knicks game and was shocked, one guy kept calling Mitchell Robinson an awful defender and explaining what made the Knicks so bad. I ended up rooting for the Knicks just because of that"
"Cool Hand Luka and the Block Ness Monster(mitchell Robinson) are pretty amazing. This era doesn't disappoint. Came across Robinsons the other day, didn't think anything was coming close to Lukas lol."
Why would the Knicks gift them Mitchell Robinson? Lol
"That's fair. I also just read that the nets have $11.4 million in exceptions from the DPE. They can definitely use this to trade for a quality big man with good rebounding and great interior defense. Maybe Dwight? There's also Cousins, McGee, and, a personal choice of mine, Mitchell Robinson. So they don't even have to get rid of anyone and still improve their defense"
&gt;Jarrett Allen and Mitchell Robinson*  FTFY
Noel plays a good amount of minutes.  Hes backup for Mitchell Robinson who was known for getting into serious foul trouble but has been good this year.  Still though Noel has been a very important part for the Knicks this year.
"For Jarett Allen? Yeah, he's worth Mitchell Robinson *and* a FRP. Mitchell Robinson's gonna look like a solid starter, but Allen is on top 5 center trajectory"
Lol we would not have given you guys Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell Robinson.
"It‚Äôs more of the fans that are sensitive to it usually. Mitchell didn‚Äôt care and he took it well.   And even then, I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúmodern day‚Äù players. MJ was the king of taking it personal, and Shaq made shit up too for motivation (David Robinson story). It‚Äôs just easier to see and have replies, thoughts, interactions, insecurities, and more today with the amount of TV coverage and social media in the world"
Are the numbers going to regress? It's likely. But it's also a good sign of Thibs is instilling a defense-first culture right out of the gates. Even our poorer perimeter defenders are closing out on three point shooters way better than previous years. It also doesn't hurt having Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel on a 48 minute rotation at the C position protecting the paint. Prevent easy threes and prevent easy bucks in the paint. It's a pretty straight forward formula. And to think the team still has more room to improve defensively says a lot about the ceiling this team can eventually have.
"Ah, the rookie Mitchell Robinson statline"
"To steal someone else‚Äôs comment, he‚Äôs basically a homeless man‚Äôs version of Mitchell Robinson  Gets some crazy blocks but fouls a shit ton and can barely make a layup"
He can block the shit out of the ball and finish lobs. like a super discount Jarrett Allen basically. or homeless mans Mitchell Robinson
"Mitchell Robinson is a clear lockdown defender. 2.2 blocks per game for his career, 1.4 steals per game this year, under 3 fouls per game."
"Mitchell Robinson can do no wrong, RJ and Julius are a great pair of initiators, and everyone is buying in.  I love it!"
Shaq probably thinks Mitchell Robinson is a god
"Shaq did it to Giannis and it worked but Giannis actually looks up to Shaq I'm guessing with his size and power game in the post. With Mitchell it's just odd. I mean obviously he was trying to motivate him, just in the worst way possible.  It all stems from the fact that Shaq used to use criticisms from Wilt to motivate him. Shaq even came up with a whole fake story about how David Robinson snubbed him when he was younger to motivate himself against him. Shaq's always thrived off negativity so he assumes others do too."
joel eats mitchell robinson for brunch bro
"Mitchell Robinson MVP because TS% is the only stat that matters.  I mean, he broke a Wilt record so he deserves All-NBA"
"is 2017 really deeper?   2018 is luka trae ofc but there's also JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Ayton if you go in lower tier player but still very good you get Shamet, Mikal Bridges  even the second round is  stacked w/ Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, De'vonte Graham Shake Milton or Gary Trent Jr  there's lot of work to be done but imo 2018 will be an all time great draft"
Mitchell Robinson
"Honestly I'm really happy where we are.  Having RJ progress into a future star, Mitchell Robinson looks like a future DPOY with him anchoring the defense, Randle looking like a eastern all star, Knox became a sniper, Quickley looking like our PG of the future, Obi looks real stretch 4 potential.  All I need is Elfrid to be benched &amp; Frank/Burks to come back &amp; we'll be a team hovering round .500 &amp; maybe make the play in"
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he‚Äôs back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he‚Äôll bounce back soon enough"

"the LA teams combining would probably be better, but the NY teams combining would be pretty close behind.  ___  correct me if im wrong cause i dont follow them, but the LA team would be  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Serge Ibaka  ___  while the NY team would be  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julius Randle  C: Mitchell Robinson"
Mitchell Robinson reminds me of this [muppet](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/ee/72/95ee72c53a4419796e68313db93803e7.jpg)
"Rj Barrett, randle, Mitchell Robinson, Payton, quickley"
Funny that Mitchell fucking Robinson could have more assists than Dort at some point this season
The guy started the game saying Mitchell Robinson is a terrible defender. They're unknowledgeable and annoying
"In the first quarter of today‚Äôs game the Celtics commentators mentioned the Knicks having ‚Äúawful possessions‚Äù at least twice, and called Mitchell Robinson a horrible defender. They definitely criticized the Celtics sometimes as well but it was just annoying to hear as a neutral fan."
Mitchell Robinson and Immanuel Quickley
I think Mitchell Robinson slots right behind Ayton.
3rd Alec Burks 4th Mitchell Robinson of Immanuel Quickley (depending on the night tbh)
Scalabrine said Mitchell Robinson is an horrible defender! üòÇ
Mitchell Robinson literally dying for our sins on the court
Mitchell Robinson isn‚Äôt moving well on that ankle... not sure why Thibs is refusing to take him out.
mitchell robinson is pretty underrated
"Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina, Jared Harper, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullcock, Mo Harkless, Ignas Brazekdis, DSJ, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, Tah Gibson."

It‚Äôs called the Sombor Shuffle and he‚Äôs been doing it for about 2 years, so that‚Äôs why your dude sounds stupid when he says guarding Jokic is easy. And you sound stupid when you compare the offense of Mitchell Robinson who is a good defender but averages 9 points and half an assist to Jokic who is by far the best offensive center in the game."
"Lmao,   Mitchell Robinson was falling for pumpfakes like always.   But from his perspective, he played good defense (which he did sometimes) and Jokic made tough shots"
1. DeAndre Ayton  2. Bam Adabeyo  3. James Wiseman  4. Mitchell Robinson  5. Jarrett Allen  6. Wendall Carter  *Onyeka Okongwu( Way to early to tell)
"My list on *expected whole career value*, but disagreements welcome:  1. Bam Adebeyo 2. DeAndre Ayton (but not currently this high) 3. Jarrett Allen 4. James Wiseman (too early to really know but his flashes are balanced by his decision making) 5. Wendall Carter Jr 6. Onyeka Okongwu (too early to really know) 7. Mitchell Robinson (I'm kind of low on him and think he's already peaked)"
Subliminal @ Mitchell Robinson
And 4 days ago Mitchell Robinson said it wasn't hard guarding Jokic
Mitchell Robinson has entered the chat
Mitchell Robinson needs to make a note of this
Mitchell Robinson said it was easy
"Blocks aren't defensive either, Mitchell Robinson would DPOY if they were. You need more advanced analytics than blocks or steal to measure defense: defensive win shares, defensive box +/-, defensive RAPTOR."
Julius Randle is signed for $17M per year. That's good value for someone who's playing at an All-Star level so far this season.   Mitchell Robinson is the team's defensive anchor and he's on a 3 year/$4M contract.
Mitchell Robinson is making $1.6m this year.
"Fuck Embid. Played him in Fantasy tonight and got shafted so hard by his 9 point performance.   Pro Tip: Never play Embid after he drops 40. It is complete fools gold. The smarter play at Center is usually a mid tier to value guy (Mitchell Robinson, Jonas, and McGee right now if Drummond is still out."
Mitchell Robinson is a defensive god yerrrrrrr
Definitely Mitchell Robinson
U see him last night? Barely looked washed up at all and was dunking all over one of the best blockers mitchell Robinson making him look like the young player he is
Where is Mitchell Robinson??
Mitchell Robinson shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to sit if he‚Äôs not in foul trouble
Mitchell Robinson seems like the Knicks best player
"Fuck it, Kyrie for Randle and Mitchell Robinson and hella picks, who even gives a fart anymore"
Trade Kyrie for Mitchell Robinson.  Get a younger defensive centerpiece gives you 2 or 3 shots at a ring with KD and Harden.  Gets you away from the Kyrie uncertainty and puts the ball in Hardens hands instead of Kyries.
"You are right that most are there for their defense/rebounding like Gobert, WCS, Biyombo, Drummond, Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Capela, Adams, etc.  But there are also many that can spread the floor (some much better than others) like Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I think it depends on the team's playstyle because sometimes the 4 is more defensively oriented and/or the 5 is more for spacing. Many of the best centers can shoot pretty well like Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP, if they're playing the 5. Also, Vucevic? I know the drop off is steep from the top 3/5 but I think he's pretty comfortably like 6 or 7th."
I just came to say I love Mitchell Robinson and I hope he‚Äôs a centerpiece for good things in the future.
He's a free agent this offseason. Why would they trade mitchell robinson and a first when they could just offer tucker a contract
"If he was going to leave, it might have been the better choice. At least Mitchell Robinson bothers to come to games."
Mitchell Robinson and a future first
He should of left Steph to play alongside Mitchell Robinson

"Danny can‚Äôt dribble against NBA players. Danny can dribble against anyone who isn‚Äôt an NBA level caliber player currently.   Have my you seen literally one of the worst players in the NBA in Brian Scalabrine torch college kids over and over even when he wasn‚Äôt in the league? Or Mitchell Robinson look like KD + Giannis in workouts in the offseason, and have 0 of that displayed in an NBA game? Or freaking Shaq raining threes a couple years ago like he‚Äôs Steph.   You‚Äôre underestimating an NBA player‚Äôs talent level by so much it‚Äôs ridiculous"
Mitchell Robinson!  ^...is ^top ^10ish
Those are rookie Mitchell Robinson numbers
"It's 30 million not even 54. He's missing the draft pick salaries, Mitchell Robinson cap hold and Frank Ntilikina's cap hold"
" &gt;That is really bad drafting by the Knicks. how do you manage to squander 3/4 of the last drafts.  I agree and disagree  They missed on Kevin Knox but then landed Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd round who would be a lottery pick  As for Obi, his numbers aren't amazing but he's also playing behind Randle who is an all star leading the league in minutes. So the opportunity isn't there.  Even if you were to some reason can the Obi pick bad this early, Immanuel Quickley was taken 25th and would easily be a top 10 pick if we were doing all early Re-Draft  So I can only half agree that the scouting was bad because we did still hit on prospects"
They got Mitchell Robinson and Quickley too tho.
"In Fizdale's first season, in 18/19, the roster of the MY Knicks was pretty shite. Kevin Knox, Dotson, Vonleh and Mudiay played the most minutes. Ok, you also hat Tim Hardaway Jr with a massive 38% from the field. After that you had Trier, Mitchell Robinson and Hezonja. Knox, Vonleh, Mudiay, Trier and Hezonja are out of the league. It was the rookie season of Knox and Robinson.   That team was garbage.    19/20 was a better team, yes, but Julius Randle has made a big big step forward. All his stats improved while shouldering more responsibility and he is rightfully an allstar.  Barett is in his second year and has improved across the board.   It also helps that Thibs knows defense in a regular season with less rest."
"True tho, but watch out for the Knicks, their best shot blocker Mitchell Robinson hasn't played the last 10 games"
"It‚Äôs gonna be Mitchell Robinson, then RJ probably"
"Was about to say, yeah Mitchell Robinson seems like the obvious candidate.  Maybe even Frank."
Why doesn‚Äôt Mitchell Robinson start?
ok I don't believe this now Shaq has to be sandbaggin this after the Mitchell Robinson one
"Nothing really, just because I don't think he can coexist with Randle and the Knicks just drafted Toppin who is also a 4. But before Randle's improvement I was hoping the Knicks would make a move for him, I really like his fit with RJ and Mitchell Robinson. I would've been ok with giving up a package centered around the 2023 Dallas pick and Knox"
People on here don‚Äôt mention Mitchell Robinson enough
Overrated: idk  Underrated: Mitchell Robinson
"I've posted this in other threads but my fantasy woes continue....  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson along with random absences like Bertans, Herro, and Hayward."
Billy Donovan Mitchell Robinson
"should have taken luka and then mitchell robinson in the 2nd round. its all good now as we in a nice spot. but if we walked out of that draft with luka, mikal, and robinson it would have been one of the best individual team drafts of all time. many of us suns fans (was still a minority of fans) were advocating for that at the time."
what i wouldnt do for 1 mitchell robinson
Lowkey would not mind it if we had an opportunity to get Mitchell Robinson though
"[Your reaction when the Celtics trade for Mitchell Robinson, not Donovan Mitchell](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abKf2GhzwLAVaQE/giphy.gif)"
"I mean, the question was about Ayton.  I'd probably have MPJ at 4 and SGA at 5. JJJ 6?  Guys that would go higher in a redraft: Mitchell Robinson, heurter, Simons, donte, mikal, brunson.  It's kind of a crap shoot to predict in what order, because outside of high lottery, team's needs factor more into it, and I don't feel like analyzing each team in 2018"
"I had a feeling some of our playoff heroes would come back to earth and some of our playoff flameouts would revert to the mean too.  When Harden was on the block and Herro was allegedly untouchable that was dumb.  Murray, Duncan Robinson, Butler, Booker and Mitchell have all shown that their bubble performance was not the new normal, just as Harrell, PG have in the other direction."
He said Mitchell Robinson was a bad defender
"Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson, Tyler Herro, Gordon Hayward... ALL on my fantasy team."
Yeah now I see y‚Äôall perimeter defenders were no help for Kat I give you that   Plus I‚Äôm so used to Mitchell Robinson showing no matter the situation if he‚Äôs in the paint there‚Äôs a 1/10 of a chance that the opponent is going to score
"This is a big game for KAT. I know it‚Äôs too late for any chance at the ASG, but maybe he can build on this. Without Mitchell Robinson, Towns destroyed Taj and Noel in the 4th"
"If D-Lo was in that game, it might‚Äôve not gone well for us. Although I can say the same thing about Mitchell Robinson. GG t-wolves fans"
A person in our sub thinks that Drummond is a low risk piece to acquire and that he would solve our teams problems with rebounding. His defensive prowess is no where near that of Mitchell Robinson or Nerlens Noel and that‚Äôs what the Knicks top 10 defense is built off of lol
"This is how I remember it as well.   It wasn't necessarily Randle, it was ""Do you need Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, and Mitchell Robinson on one team? Where are all the minutes going to come from when they're all healthy?""  In retrospect it makes a lot more sense if you know that you're going to trade Morris and/or Bobby Portis.  Yeah they overpaid for both, but in doing so, the knicks put themselves in a position where there was no long term implications.  Overall it was a pretty low-risk move."
"Klay is legitimately one of the very last rotation players that I would expect to get a quadruple double. The guy barely even dribbles a lot of games. He's averaged 2.3 assists over the course of his career playing the entirety of it next to Steph and a few years of it next to KD and Steph. He's averaged 3.5 rebounds and it's not like the Warriors have ever had some Drummond/Capela type who just grabbed all the rebounds. He's never even had a triple double. He's only ever had 4 double doubles in 615 games. And he's a good defender but he's averaged less than 1 steal a game over his career, his best season was 1.1. Dame isn't much better, only one triple double ever and only averages about a steal per game too. Even Steph, KD, etc don't get many triple doubles. Harden could obviously get a triple double with ease; his best chance for a quadruple double if he got lucky + gambled on like every pass for a game to get steals.             I think Draymond is most likely if any current player were to get one. Guys like Sabonis, Jokic would have a ""good"" (relatively) shot as well. After that, I think it would be big men who randomly get lucky and get 10 assists. It's a lot more likely for Mitchell Robinson, Myles Turner to get 10 assists during a 10 block game than it is for a lot of other guys to randomly get 10 blocks or steals when that's just not one of their skills.          Also I do think plenty of players care about stuff like this. We know for sure some guys won't heave at the end of quarters to protect their %s. I've definitely seen stories of guys talking to their home scorers to make sure they get borderline assists. Westbrook definitely cares about triple doubles. Definitely seen a lot of guys get a little antsy to grab the rebound or force a pass when they're at 8 or 9."
"He can, he just doesn't have the skill, Athleticism whatever it is to do it against NBA defenders consistently. Mitchell Robinson plays like a 7 foot demigod in practice but can't do it in game"
"Yeah,    Bruce Brown   Mykhaliuk   Milton   Gary Trent Jr   Hamidou Diallo   Brunson   Graham   Mitchell Robinson     Nobody of Jokic's caliber tho"
Thanasis reminds me of Mitchell Robinson in that if he gets enough time on the floor he's either going to hurt himself or someone else.
Didn‚Äôt Mitchell Robinson just go down? Weird thing to post when like the most pivotal piece hasn‚Äôt been able to play
Mitchell Robinson had a talk show called ‚ÄúMitch‚Äôs Block Party‚Äù which is coming back soon
Damn I thought Mitchell Robinson was a better shooter thanks for the info
"Lmao I was just joking, the draft really is deep as hell. Didnt mean to try and undermine your opinion. Like shake milton, mitchell robinson, hamidou diallo, jalen brunson and devonte graham all drafted in the second round is a great pool of talent to choose from. Could be they are in situations good for them, but the skill and potential between all of them is amazing."
Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel for co mvp I guess
I am gonna play it safe and pick Mitchell and Robinson
"If Mitchell and Robinson were more appealing, I‚Äôd agree with you. But you‚Äôre getting an all star that has only had marginal improvements in his last three years and a roleplayer. Both Bates and Holmgren are supposed to be generational prospects and you only really need one of them to work out."
What kind of nonsense is this? I'm taking Mitchell and Robinson with no hesitation
"Everyone saying ""Bates and Holmgren have crazy potential, obviously them"" -- remember when Andrew Wiggins was the second coming? When Jahlil Okafor was the next MVP Center? Highly touted prospects with insane ""potential"" bust all the time. You take Mitchell and Robinson any day of the week."
Would you start Mitchell/Brown/Robinson/Tatum/Theis in that situation? Could be a filthy combo
Mitchell and Robinson ... not even close
For the pistons give me bates and Chet   But if I was a contending team I would take Mitchell and Robinson
I feel like Mitchell and Robinson are solid pieces to start a rebuild
"As the Celtics, give me Mitchell and Robinson. Duncan and Don. D&amp;D.   I think that Boston with those two are true title contenders for the next few seasons.   Guards - Mitchell, Kemba, Smart, Pritchard   Wings - Tatum, Brown, Robinson, Semi, Nesmith, Langford   Bigs - Theis, TT, Williams, Williams   Thats a deep 13 man rotation. An expensive team, but good."
"Imagine if the Lakers had Duncan Robinson and Mitchell, basically any contender would take the sure pick, bar exceptions"
"No, you don‚Äôt. Bates and Holmgren have way more potential than Mitchell and Robinson"
Bates and Holmgren because both have the potential to be better than Mitchell and Robinson
"Bates and Holmgreen.   Mitchell looks like a perennial All-Star, but I think he tops out as a 3rd team All-NBA. He is a lot smaller than people think too. Robinson is a solid player, but he is a replaceable level talent.   Bates looks like the next big American prospect. He is giving off major KD vibes. There is a reason he was the first Sophomore to win national player of the year."
First one because you had me at Donovan Mitchell then lost me on Duncan Robinson
Mitchell and Robinson because we don‚Äôt know if Bates and Holmgren will be great players
"26yr old, 20 yr old, 21 yr old  We got a core, a Mitchell Robinson, and 7 first round picks coming up"
"With McDonough you can't assume we'd have taken Mitchell Robinson after taking Ayton lol, his track record is not good enough to assume that  There's a flipside to this to where Luka is too good too fast in a way that results on us missing on Monty Williams due to potentially keeping Igor and/or McDonough. In which case believe me, we would have found a way to blow up this hypothetical. Things could always have gone better in any situation, but as things are now I'm content. I watched this team draft and also waste Bender, Chriss, Jackson, etc. I can very much live with Ayton. Besides, it can't be understated the importance of talented young players going to the right situation. Idk what Luka would look like with us, or what Ayton would look like with the Kings or Hawks or whomever he would have ended up at"
"Because people don‚Äôt realize how crazy good Adams is, his numbers don‚Äôt reflect how good he is at all. Pretty sure his team‚Äôs offensive rebounding percentage is crazy higher with him on the court than off the court for his career. And people don‚Äôt understand how smart he is, Adams makes all the stuff he does look easy but only a couple guys in the league can do what he does.  That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs still a good player playing his style and got $40/2 year extension last offseason. Him, Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Clint Capela, and Rudy Gobert are the only starting centers in the league who still play that way, and Jordan probably shouldn‚Äôt even be a starter anymore (maybe Jarrett Allen should take his spot in this list though). It‚Äôs REALLY hard to play center in the league without a three point shot now."
"Same. Also had the following happen this week: Mitchell Robinson, Hayward sit out, Herro sit out, Deandre Jordan sit out, Deandre Hunter undergo surgery, Anthony Davis, and then picked up Paul Millsap Saturday night only for him to get hurt also.   Meanwhile the team I played against had 4/5 keeps play four games. Murray had 8 steals on game, Porzingis had 6 blocks... I have the absolute worst luck in fantasy. I think of the 8 weeks so fae I've had an advantage in players once by two guys and I've also been outnumbered anywhere between 7-14."
[Story on looming Mitchell Robinson](https://i.imgur.com/8kkvd9b.jpg)
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
"2018 2nd round draft is panning out pretty fantastic; Devonte‚Äô Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr, Hamidou Diallo, De‚ÄôAnthony Melton and Shake Milton. Most of these guys are going to make a nice chunk of change this offseason."
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He‚Äôs a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I‚Äôd assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."
All time Russell obviously.  Right now Mitchell Robinson.  He's fast enough and rangy enough to guard anyone you throw at him.
"Yea, I‚Äôm fine ignoring Quickley‚Äôs 12 PPG on 40% shooting. And Mitchell Robinson, guy who‚Äôs been an year away from being an year away isn‚Äôt exactly a diamond either. The Knicks will be spending another year near the bottom of the eastern conference, with another high draft pick, which they‚Äôll undoubtedly mess up again."
Lets just ignore Mitchell Robinson and Immanuel Quickley
"They should have been drafting around the top 5 for the last 3-4 years. Cleared up cap space and went after decent free agents while guys like Porzingis were on rookie deals.      I don't get why they went out and signed THJ or used the cap space from the Porzingis trade to get Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, and Marcus Morris. That's 4 older, mediocre, low ceiling PFs, when their 2 best young players at the time were Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson."
"Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Gobert, Bam, Porzingis, Nurkic, Vucevic, Ayton, Jonas, Wood, Allen, Capela, Adams, BroLo, Turner, Drummond make 17. Then arguably Thomas Bryant, Dan Theis, Mitchell Robinson, and LaMarcus Aldridge."
"Despite having the slowest pace and fewest field goals per game, we have three of our starters with 200 paint attempts. Our other starter is Mitchell Robinson who only dunks. Please bench Payton so we can have any semblance of spacing."
"&gt; He's the clear best rebounder in the league, but it's not even clear that teams rebound better when he's on the floor.  Give me the best guy at boxing out over the best rebounder. A guy like Adams probably benefits his team on the boards more than Drummond.  And just a few others to consider for your list: Giannis, Mitchell Robinson, Randle, Kanter."
Saying that as a team with Mitchell Robinson and Quickley...
"Fwiw Mitchell Robinson wasn‚Äôt some unknown who got drafted late, he had issues with his college and ended up not playing a single game for them which left a bad taste in ppls mouths. The guy was a McDonald‚Äôs all-American player"
Hmmm I wouldn‚Äôt exactly describe Mitchell Robinson as a chucker /s
Well technically he‚Äôs just having the most efficient season the way Steph was more efficient than Jose Calderon. Guys like Mitchell Robinson or Jamal Murray have insane splits at the rim on low volumes
"Yeah but for the Knicks, they don‚Äôt have two off seasons, they have to pay Randle next season, assuming they pick up his team option which they probably will. They also have to pay Mitchell Robinson, and this will dig into their own cap space."
"38% from three and 45% from the field for a 20 year old 2nd option on a playoff team that doesn‚Äôt have much spacing with Elfrid Payton and Mitchell Robinson being 40% of the starting lineup is actually rather efficient and in fact, he has a higher FG% and 3pt% than Ja Morant, Coby White, and Tyler Herro while playing much better defense than they are as well. Given his situation offensively being lesser than stellar I would actually say he‚Äôs been pretty efficient."
Robert Williams is going to show ~~Mitchell Robinson~~ John Henson what a real center is
"Check 1998-2003 winners. 3x DRob, Shaq in 2002, TMAC 2003?   Here‚Äôs the top 10 list for years: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_per_48_top_10.html  To name a few ridiculous ones:  Zubac in 4th 2020  Mitchell Robinson 5th 2020  Clint Capela 4th 2018  Tyson chandler 4th 2013  Tiago spitter 8th 2013  This is a terrible metric for actual value."
"if this dude becomes an all star theres going to be major confusion between the mitchells,  sidenote hopefully knicks get him so we can have Davion Mitchell Robinson"
Mitchell Robinson because he has no offense and doesn't shoot 3s he is easily replaceable which isn't true
"Not really, he‚Äôs not Mitchell Robinson or anything. He gets a normal amount of fouls. It‚Äôs just playing Embiid. He draws an outrageous amount of fouls and Rob isn‚Äôt savvy enough to know how to play him yet. Remember, we used Kanter more in the playoffs against the Sixers and Rob against the Raptors so Brad clearly doesn‚Äôt love the matchup there anyway.  The point was to have TT for sixers games because he‚Äôs stronger, to wear out Embiid a bit more and soak up some fouls."
"Then how does this comment:  ""It's sort of weird hearing a Warriors fan satisfied with wasting more of Steph's prime. Sure when it's all said and done you'll be happy regardless. But right now, the goal for the FO should be to not let another year of Steph's prime be wasted. And if I was a GSW fan I'd be on board with that lol""  make any sense?  Yeah, we should've drafted Lamelo, we know. We also should've drafted Keldon Johnson in 2019 and Mitchell Robinson in 2018, that's just how the draft goes sometimes. If there's literally nothing that the Warriors front office can do right now, what use is there for Warriors fans to be dissatisfied with how the Warriors are handling the current situation."
Mitchell Robinson would go top 10 imo
Mitchell Robinson is pretty good I thought? I guess expectations just different when you a 2nd round pick
Knicks were missing one player today (Mitchell Robinson). Nets were missing 6 players (KD/Harden/Shamet/Griffin/Dinwiddie/Johnson)
"He really doesn‚Äôt, he has cool highlights but so does Mitchell Robinson"
"Theres also just not that many actual 7 footers in the league these days but Brook lopez, markkanen, mitchell robinson all seem to be pretty mid tier guys"
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
Rose Burks RJ randle Mitchell Robinson - knicks
"I mean just going by this season 3-point shooting:  Joe Ingles- 50% on 5.5 Attempts per game Joe Harris- 48.2% on 6.7 attempts a game Duncan Robinson- 40.4% on on 8.6 attempts per game.   Huge drop off there in percentage. Just got some perspective Donovan Mitchell is shooting 40.3% on 8.6 attempts, nearly identical to Robinson and he‚Äôs been known as a chucker. So yes there‚Äôs a drop off after Ingles and Harris."
Fair point. I‚Äôm definitely a Mitchell Robinson fan. Just trying to be optimistic about my team‚Äôs guy.
"&gt;Gobert, Bam, Nurkic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, Ayton, Mitchell Robinson, Poetl, Steven Adams. Then you have all-star level centers that aren't great defenders like Jokic, Vucevic or KAT. So that's already a lot of names considering that 6/7 centers make the all-star teams, if that.  Robinson doesn't play defense consistently and Adams doesn't provide help defense consistently.  Of the rest you mentioned they are all ""all star level"".  Which just proves my point."
"Gobert, Bam, Nurkic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, Ayton, Mitchell Robinson, Poetl, Steven Adams. Then you have all-star level centers that aren't great defenders like Jokic, Vucevic or KAT."
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"
Mitchell Robinson went through a similar scenario where he didn‚Äôt play any college basketball after high school and he was still an impact player his rookie year. Struggled with fouling his first 2 years but he was still a positive player on the court
"So you're saying he's rookie Mitchell Robinson?  We can fix him, we have the technology."
2019 was a big draft year for the Warriors. Really though the only real mistake they made was not taking Nicolas Claxton.   2018 was the bigger mistake not going with Mitchell Robinson.
"Embiid third year contract coming off a near career ending foot injury and hardly playing competitive basketball for 2 years. He was playing on a minute restriction on a trash team.  Did anybody really think Embiid was gonna dominate his competition? No. He proved everybody wrong.  People were calling Wiseman Chris Bosh and AD off of workout videos and now that he isn't Chris Bosh or AD, it's unfair?  Wiseman just needed to put up Bagley numbers and that would've made him look like a budding star. But now he's ass, we got excuses.  Mitchell Robinson was killing it his rookie year. Zion came off an injury and was 300 plus pounds.  Wiseman is playing with Stephen Curry, in a good organization, all he has to do is finish plays and box out."
"Embiid was 2 years removed from playing any competitive basketball and dominated per minute coming off a foot injury on a trash team with barely any starting caliber players facing double teams. If Embiid put up rookie Wiseman numbers his rookie season, that's a win for him.  Joel was a better prospect than Wiseman. I am not expecting Wiseman to dominate, I am expecting him to show an NBA starting C skill. Mitchell Robinson was in a similar situation as Wiseman and balled out.  Is he a good rebounder, is he a good finisher. He's a legit 7 footer and he can't box out. He's a legit 7 footer and he isn't an impressive finisher.   Like, can Wiseman be prime Tyson Chandler as a rookie? All he has to do is finish plays and screen and box out. He can't do that right now and I am sure that's all he is expected to do for 18 to 24 mins.  Wiseman isn't expected to do much on the Warriors."
"Of course Top 3 picks are rarely immediately good but that's why a GM like Hinkie understood that franchise lifting players like Lebron, AD, Embiid, KD are immediately good and those are the players you want. You don't have time to dedicate resources to players that aren't those players because there's a window like OKC had where you can get 3 of those guys on the same squad and make a run before you have to pay them. If they aren't gonna lift your franchise get rid of them.  Let's take KAT for an example, he was supposed to be a star defensive player because he was at UK, but he isn't in the pros. However, he in his rookie years he put up a near 20 10 double double with a 22 PER and 59TS.  KAT was a monster rookie and he turned out to be a generational offensive player.  I understand Wiseman didn't have a college career but Wiseman haven't even shown he can do basic big man stuff like rebound or block shots. Mitchell Robinson didn't play college either but he came into the league an exceptional shotblocker and a great finished.  Mitchell Robinson had a better rookie season than Wiseman.  Star players play don't get developed is my point. They already have the skills and productivity. If you are a top 3 pick, you should be ready to go."
"Toppin is legitimately the 10th man, even with Mitchell Robinson out.   Thibs would bring on Burks, Rose, Quickly and Gibson on before him."
"Mitchell Robinson has been in and out of the season with injuries, RJ barely plays with IQ since IQ is coming off the bench in tandem with D Rose or Rivers early on and Noel is a blackhole on offense so I don't see how he's helping RJ on that front, same with Mitch. Both those centers can't space the floor so they clog the paint and every now and then RJ will find them for dump off passes"
"&gt;As if RJ is playing with some elite teammates right now. He shares a fucking backcourt with Elfrid Payton. Randle is a great player to play with, he is not representative for the rest of our roster tho  Mitchell Robinson,IQ and Nerlens Noel weren't good teammates to have also for most of the season?"
Watching Mitchell Robinson In the off-season and he looks like KD/Giannis lol. These modern dude‚Äôs skillsets are insane; they‚Äôve put so many hours in. You just can‚Äôt see it all the time because they‚Äôre playing against other people at the same level.

Why have Mitchell Robinson when you can have Mitchell Robinson 2.0?
Mitchell Robinson and Duncan Robinson
Robert Williams is arguably a better player then Mitchell Robinson.. rob will just been getting 10 minutes less playing time
Tbh I‚Äôm very high on Mitchell Robinson I want to believe he could one day be better than Rudy gobert by then I start watch the Utah Jazz defensive schemes and then I started watching their games and I‚Äôm just wondering is that man the greatest rim protector of all time like when mitch is in the paint people think twice about going in and he always makes sure to make it difficult for them to score but with Rudy he traps players   he uses the players around him to his advantage and plus he also serious makes it difficult for his opponents when they take a shot   But mainly I‚Äôm telling there‚Äôs more to his defense than just blocks especially on offense his impact is insane on both sides of the floor
"You're right but you can make that claim about anyone.If luka kills kawhi that doesn't make kawhi a bad defender. But tell me this, since you root for the Knicks. Do you really believe mitchell Robinson couldn't do what Gobert does if he played in Utah? Like if Rudy played for the wizards (league worst defense]) would he still be as highly rated as he is in Utah?"
PG - RJ Barrett 6‚Äô6 SG - Reggie Bullock 6‚Äô6 SF - Julius Randle 6‚Äô8 PF - Nerlens Noel 6‚Äô10 C - Mitchell Robinson 7‚Äô0
I remember when scal sad Mitchell Robinson wasn‚Äôt a very good defender and he retracted it not too long after
"I guess they could front load Randle's contract but I feel like backloading is always a bad idea, especially when RJ's contract will be up later and maybe Mitchell Robinson as well. It's always nice to have flexibility in uncertain situations."
"A young rising player, maybe a player such as Mitchell Robinson or other young goons, I‚Äôm a raps fan and Kyle is my fav player and he‚Äôs got some left in the tank but he‚Äôs gonna decline from here, the best reasonable offer for the raps would be like Michael porter jr or another young guy"

It‚Äôs comparable  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/kristaps-porzingis-player-injuries  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/mitchell-robinson-player-injuries  Obviously not the severity of KP‚Äôs but it‚Äôs concerning
"I hope so because I have both of them on my fantasy team. Somehow I'm in 3rd with having Davis, Drummond, Embiid, Beasley, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson and a slew of others hurt and injured for random games.  My FA pickup game is strong."
"if thibs can get drummond to buy in, then it makes robinson expendable in a potential piece for another all star. i love robinson and think hes got dpoy potential, but, and im entirely speaking in hypotheticals here, hes gonna get real expensive in a lil bit, and locking up drummond for like 3/45 might be a better deal for the knicks. again tho, this would require drummond actually buying in tho. big gamble based on his past issues on the court  but they can keep their cap space open + mitchell becomes a big trading piece for them. barret + mitch for beal could be a potential play for them maybe? idk. but either way, drummond would be a high risk, high reward signing. i like it for them"
I feel bad for Mitchell Robinson and Noel.
Is this guy gonna start ahead of Robinson because I don't see him agreeing as a bench player. I like Mitchell for the Knicks as a starter
"I agree with the caption 100% and he can't switch onto guards and wings. In a sense his defense is almost overrated. Utah whole scheme is designed to over play shooters, forcing them to drive right into Rudy.  I always argue, if you put dwight,  capella, mitchell Robinson, Mcgee, Jarret Allen and similar bigs in Utah, the scheme would still work. I'm not going to be like Shaq and say he is a bum. But I believe Rudy is extremely overrated."
No shot Knicks trade Mitchell Robinson lmfao
Mitchell Robinson
"Excessive fouling has always been his problem, he‚Äôs like Mitchell Robinson on steroids in that respect. 4 fouls in 16 minutes tonight... yea. But yes he can protect the rim and is athletic as hell"
My man really snuck Mitchell Robinson in there.
"Nope.  Gobert, Giannis, Simmons, Myles Turner, and Embiid should all be well ahead of him.  He might be around the same tier as Draymond, Bam, Mitchell Robinson, Kawhi --- those guys."
"Personally I think its the right move to let him go because we have 4 starting caliber guards and I think monk can step into his role, if we get back someone who can make it worthwhile for us. Don't really know about the availability of Mitchell Robinson or what his trade value is tbh but I assume since the knicks are still a solid defensive team without him they could use rozier for his 3 pt shooting and closing. We might have to add assets as I've been told by some other hornets fans, like I said I'm not really sure what Mitch's trade value is."
Mitchell Robinson has a higher FG% than Wilt???
"Point guard is more critical but you need post and rim defense in some way, shape, or form.  If you gave me Draymond Green and Mitchell Robinson, I'd be in a good spot defensively but I'd be in a great spot with an elite scoring or playmaking 1."
"I don't know about it being the hardest to learn on defense; off the top of my head Mitchell Robinson, Jarrett Allen, and Bam Adebayo all had really strong defensive showings right off the bat.   I'd say that it's harder for young wing players to be good defenders because they can't get by on athleticism alone, they need actual technique."
There's an elephant in the room that was missing.  His name is Mitchell Robinson and he's wonderful.
"&gt; The other part is that his value isn‚Äôt going to radically change in the next year.  This is the only part I'm unsure about - how much does his market depend on the Boston TPE? Who is the next-season team that is going to want to add an offensive center at the deadline?  Just going through the top 10 in the West nowhere really makes sense to me.  In the East I guess Charlotte and the Knicks (depending on Mitchell Robinson RFA) could potentially make sense, so there are at least multiple plausible landing spots. I'd also love him on Milwaukee, but they don't really have anything to offer."
Mitchell Robinson
Probably Mitchell Robinson
New York shouldn't. He's gonna mess up things for Randle and Mitchell Robinson is only a couple of weeks away from returning.
"Crazy thing is, one of his biggest improvements is that he cut down on block chasing.   In his rookie season his blk% was 12.5% (5.1 blocks per 36). Knicks fans would post threads saying rookie Mitchell Robinson was leading the league at 10% and then rage when it was pointed out Rob was higher.  Now both have dropped their blocking rates and have grown as defenders as a result.   Rob's blk% is 9.5 (3.6 blocks per 36) and it's comfortably his most impactful season on the defensive end. He's a great example of how impactful shot-blocking can be but also why blocks aren't all there is to defence."
"Mitchell Robinson has really cut down on that this year, feel like he's taken a big leap with a new coach"
Wiseman has to stop biting on the fakes. Seems like a young athletic big man problem. I see Robert Williams and Mitchell Robinson jump too early like what Wiseman has been doing.
"I'd still take JJJ at 4, or even Ayton tbh  Also I feel like it'd be better for the hornets to have Mitchell Robinson not De'Anthony Melton"
"I don't think he's a good defender but I do think the eye test distracts from a lot of aspects of defense. You can have bad defensive technique and still make a huge defensive impact. I'd argue that's true for guys like Mitchell Robinson. Even Drummond to an extent, as well as historical guys like Shaq. Taking up space is a bonus on defense but it doesn't show up if you're just tracking errors."
"What??   There is no bad time to be good, you acting as if this is only chance at playoffs  Quickly 20 Barrett 20 Randle 27 Obi tobbin 22 Mitchell Robinson 22  These guys will continue to get better and better   Only gonna go up from here, happy for knick fans"
"Sweet, now on my fantasy team the only guys I have hurt/not playing are: Embiid, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, DeAndre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson and David Bertans."
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."
"He has made enormous improvements this year, that second part is just not true.  Mitchell Robinson is a little bit better then him, but has a lot of the same problems. Shake and Brunson are right around his level. Trent is better."
Mitchell Robinson is a rim running center. I think it is way to early to decide what Wiseman is or isnt.  He played 3 college games and got drafted by the Warriors who have established star players where you want the ball in their hands at this point more than Wiseman. Wiseman is focusing on the game speed and how to play defense vs being expected to score that doesnt mean he cant. I think its important to remember the role they are asked to do. Jokic developed into what he is today. KAT and Embiid were the last 2 big men that came in with great offensive skillsets.
"He can choose to take the MLE, maybe 2 years and the 3rd a player option from a bunch of good teams, or maybe get a 15M a year offer from Charlotte or maybe the Spurs if they want him as a 5 to split time with Poeltl and just let the wings and guards they have get a ton of playing time instead of bringing back Demar or signing another wing or guard. Knicks could also do it I guess and trade Mitchell Robinson to some team for a wing, guard or pick.   So yeah, probably MLE but 30 percent or so chance he gets say 45/3 from one of those teams. Could also do a sign and trade if he's not bought out this month and then it's more likely he gets to 40 or 45M over 3."
"Yup but I think pairing him alongside Noel could potentially mask his deficiencies, Mitchell Robinson is coming back soon enough so Noel will move back to the bench"

Curry Luka LeBron OG Mitchell Robinson
&gt; He thought RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson could potentially be flipped for seasoned veterans  Thank god for Leon Rose and Bruce Aller for saving Thibs from himself
"&gt;He pleaded for Rose to offer long-term deals to free agents such as Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris and Bogdan Bogdanovic. He wanted to trade for Derrick Rose, a longtime favorite of his.  Ok not that bad but I can see the reasoning  &gt;He thought RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson could potentially be flipped for seasoned veterans. Initially, he was hardly sold on Julius Randle, according to a colleague.  Alright Thibs relax..."
Mitchell Robinson doesn't know who Hakeem Olajuwon is.
"The hawks were not healthy in that game lol we were missing Bogi, Hunter, Snell, Dunn and Rondo. Everyone will be back for playoffs except for Rondo is now Lou Will. You think Mitchell Robinson is that important? Pleaseeeee y‚Äôall are delusional man. Can‚Äôt wait to wax that ass and watch Stephen A cry"
"i mean, i wouldn't necessarily call knicks full strength without mitchell robinson (although admittedly he's not a huge contributor on offense), but yeah it's super disingenuous to call that bad offense, especially for the injuries the lakers were dealing with."
"We are missing:  -	Mitchell Robinson: our best rebounder (both O and D) who sets the most significant box outs on the team  -	Alec Burks: secondary playmaker and big shot maker, especially in 4Q -	Immanuel Quickley: an offensive threat from every spot with infinite range, our main floor spacer   It‚Äôs easy to overlook because Julius, Rose, and RJ are healthy but those three guys have been a huge part of our success and not having them has as big an impact on us as much as a Schroeder, Caruso, or Bron has on the Lakers.   It would have been nice to see both teams go at it at full strength, but we got a good game anyway. At this point let‚Äôs hope for a Lakers Knicks Finals with our teams fully healthy so we can watch the slugfest over a series of games."
It is crazy to think about how well the Knicks have done this season in spite of their best center breaking his foot months ago.  We miss you Mitchell Robinson.
"Mitchell Robinson, Quickley and Burks. We basically had no reliable option at PG and forced a ton of minutes on Rose"
Mitchell Robinson   Imagine this guy playing in a league where the average center was 6‚Äô9 230 (in 1960 season)  https://youtu.be/lQb5SWNRrgA
PG: Luka(8.0)/ Trae(6.5)/ SGA(4.1)  SG: Lavine(19.5)/ Mitchell(5.1)/ Gary Trent Jr.(1.6)  SF: OG(3.8)/ Mikal(4.3)/ Duncan Robinson(1.8)  PF: Tatum(9.8)/ Zio(10.2)/ MPJ(3.5)  C: Bam(5.1)/ Brook(13.0)/ Dwight(2.5)
"Bruh. First off thats Mitchell Robinson. 2nd off he is in a totally different position than Adams is in this clip. These two clips are nothing alike lmao  Mitch's man is in the paint so thats where he is so he is in position. Adams man in the other clip is griffin who is shooting 40% from 3 in Brooklyn. At that point you have to trust Naji, the bigger longer defender, is gonna make the play because hoping for that is a lot better than allowing a wide open shooter to shoot."
RJ with better handles would make him a better shot creator and playmaker and one of the deadliest 2nd/3rd options in the league imo  Randle with more athleticism would make him like a Top 10 player in the game imo  Also Mitchell Robinson with a jumpshot would make him one of the scariest two way bigs in the league
Mitchell Robinson is Lob City in 2k20 mycareer and I‚Äôll Stan him for life.
"Knicks have been missing future Hall of Famer Mitchell Robinson, and more recently, future Hall of Famers Quickley and Burks..so‚Ä¶I sorta don‚Äôt see your point.   Knicks just have more depth where guys can step up in those players‚Äô absences, that‚Äôs the difference."
"We are the most valuable team in the nba and one of the most valuable teams in sports period but we‚Äôve been the laughing stock of the nba for years. Consistently making bad moves, bad draft picks and just being bad. We were the go to team when making a joke. In 2019 we drafted RJ Barrett with the 3rd pick in the draft and we signed Julius Randle who was never considered that good of a player. Recently, Julius Randle has made an insane jump and he‚Äôs become an allstar this season. Our team isn‚Äôt as good as others but we play hard defense and hustle harder than every other team and we‚Äôve surpassed expectations. We have a few young players with potential, rj barrett, Immanuel Quickley we drafted with the 25th pick, Mitchell Robinson, Obi toppin he‚Äôs a high flyer dunker. And we have good vets, Derrick Rose was one of the best young players in the nba and would probably be an all time great but injuries ruined his career. This year he has been really good but in his prime before the injuries he was a top 10 player in the nba. Julius Randle is our teams leader. New York has two teams, us and the nets. The nets are one of the best teams in the league but most New Yorkers don‚Äôt really like them. We also play in Madison square garden.   Here are some videos about us currently   https://youtu.be/CDPJ2hlboAM  https://youtu.be/KvODVmmraZU   Here‚Äôs one of our best games this season   https://youtu.be/qRNZ7qaIwu8    Here‚Äôs a video about why we have been so bad throughout the years    https://youtu.be/TjmtQ-oee9E"
We didn‚Äôt trade for rose until a chunk into the season. Mitchell Robinson has hardly played. Burks has missed a good chunk of time.
*Grave Digger gif* Mitchell Robinson reenters the chat
"drummond is not the league's best rebounder.  A good way to look at rebounding contribution is the same way as looking at scoring/defense contribution: adjusted regressions. It's RAPM in scoring but you can get adjusted REB% (how much you affect the rebounding of your lineups). Here's the current 5yr leaders  * Steven Adams (1st in oreb, 44th dreb) * Capela (3rd in oreb, 6th in dreb) * Boban (6th in oreb, 4th in dreb)  JV, Kanter, TT, DeAndre, Dwight, Looney and Nurkic round out the top 10. Drummond is 13th (7th in oreb, 212th in dreb).   It's also how we know Westbrook (310th) , Harden (837th) aren't huge rebound contributors, despite their impressive counting numbers. Adams doesn't have the counting numbers but he boxes out extremely well and someone on his team gets the rebound.   The 3 year numbers have Drummond at 7th (With Favors and Mitchell Robinson sneaking into the top 10)."
"Mitchell Robinson is one of my favorite players but uh, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Mitchell isn't even an all-star yet and LeBron and AD are hall of famers lol"
"1. Julius Randle.  He‚Äôs risen to a whole new level this season that I didn‚Äôt think he had in him going into the year. When we signed him I hoped we were getting an all star and he‚Äôs proven to be even more after a rough first year.  2. RJ Barrett.  He quietly improved on both sides of the ball significantly, and after today he raised his season 3P% to 40%. Still a teenager as well 3. Mitchell Robinson.  Even though he‚Äôs been hurt the majority of this season, he‚Äôs so important for us. If we had him this year, we‚Äôd be even scarier. Noel is locking his position down for us and he‚Äôs the 5th most important Knick imo.   The other honorable mention in 4th is D Rose, he just proved how clutch he is and how good he is at his role. I think that he will be a legit 6MOTY contender next year if we resign him. He should be a Knick for life imo.   Also, I think Westbrook is definitely 2 or 3 on the wizards despite his age and contract because I think his play is what‚Äôs carried the wizards down the stretch here. Plus if you look at it the other way, he could end up in a future trade if his play continues to bring wins, as teams will take the contract."
Mitchell Robinson is out for you guys and he's better than both those bums
"Those players i mentioned missed WAY more games. So no, I‚Äôm not comparing them. You asked who the Knicks third best player is. It‚Äôs Mitchell Robinson or DRose who missed 72 games combined. Kat missed 22. And DLo.. honestly you‚Äôre better without him. He‚Äôs a net negative.   Right so the warriors took wiggins and 1 first  And you got back DLo   But if you traded wiggins for nothing you‚Äôd have to trade multiple unprotected firsts   So basically you‚Äôre saying DLo is worth negative multiple firsts   People had the twolves based on talent projected higher this year. Knicks have 17 more wins. I don‚Äôt think you can chalk that up to some players missing.   I think guys like Randle and RJ are winners and want it. Are hungry. DLo and towns professionally have lost everywhere they‚Äôve went or haven‚Äôt gone. Counting stats."
"Did you just compare KAT to Mitchell Robinson Drose and Taj while also completely leaving out Beasley from our injury list? The warriors took a pick because the cost to get off Wiggins contract was astronomically high. Before that trade we couldn‚Äôt deal him away without giving up multiple unprotected firsts. The wolves would look a lot fucking better off if instead of KAT, DLO, and Beasley missing time they didn‚Äôt have Rubio, Okogie, and Reid. What a terrible comparison and understanding of the Wolves."
"I like RJ and Quickley a lot but Mitchell Robinson is insanely overrated, dude chases blocks, gets dunks, but is a negative at everything else  I think it‚Äôs close but Bane is so much better than Robinson that I go with Grizz core"
"Robert williams is much better than Mitchell robinson. Just look at their stats this year. Rob has almost the same blocks points and rebounds as Mitchell on like 7 minutes less per game. He also has a positive turnover ratio of 1.5 to 1. Where Mitchell has a negative ratio and doesnt even average an assist per game. Robert williams also has a higher completion percentage. When Rob is fully healthy and the de facto starter of the celtics next year, he will be light years ahead of Mitchell."
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
miss you Mitchell Robinson
Jokic is 80 pounds heavier than Noel. Not having Mitchell Robinson is hurting us here unfortunately
"Fun fact, three months ago this sub clowned Mitchell Robinson for saying it wasn't hard to defend Jokic. Jokic dropped 22 that night, reminder that r/nba is full of a bunch of nephews, you can't stop players like Jokic, just contain them.  https://streamable.com/xgh9kc"
"This sub really clowned Mitchell Robinson for holding Jokic to 22, and saying it was easy to defend him, literally having confidence in his defense. Jokic beat that in a quarter this game without Mitch, this sub is full of a bunch of clowns."
"Because Mitchell Robinson can‚Äôt create his own shot.   Zion gets 27 PPG with close to no spacing around him. Zion Scores more than Tatum with less shots and WAYYYY BETTER EFFICIENCY.  8% is a massive difference. Guess what too, Zions more efficient than Mitchell Robinson while scoring close to 20 more ppg and creating his shots. Zion also does this with no spacing around him which means he would be even more efficient with spacing.   You used an example of how Giannis offence falls off in the playoffs, but even Giannis playoff scoring is more efficient than this seasons Tatum.   And Zion does have way more gravity, because he can collapse defences. Defences have actually been running into issues where they sag off him on the 3 point line which allows Zion to gather speed into his drives before he catches the ball making him even more deadly in the half court. This makes it so Zion blows by them because he is too fast and agile while being out of this world strength.   Zion is also a lot better at drawing FTs than Tatum. Also if the job is to put the ball in the basket it doesn‚Äôt matter how you do it, especially when one guy scores more baskets with less touches."
Goddamn it I wish I could asked him about Mitchell Robinson. I heard he worked out with AD to prepare for the draft
Mitchell Robinson
"That cap space will disappear quick. Randle needs to get paid, and Rose/Taj/Nerlens/Bullock are all free agents after this season and all four are integral to our success, not the mention Mitchell Robinson who is waiting to get paid. But if we want to land another star (a big IF), we have five 1st rounders at our disposal."
"Teams get expensive fast.   Nets had to deal with this in the D‚ÄôLo Playoff year.    Plus the level of players you get on a 1+1 with a Team Option to keep the Cap Space open are a lower caliber player Vs Free Agents who you can sign to a 3-4yr contract.   Randle has a $29m cap hold next offseason which is still less than the Max he will likely get in NY. Believe that Knox has a $17m Cap Hold which would likely be less since they‚Äôll either cut, trade, or re sign him to less $.   Then you have Mitchell Robinson up for FA along with Rose and Noel.   Within a blink of an eye this Knicks team becomes really expensive since they‚Äôre going to try and get better every offseason Vs sitting idle and hoping for the best."
"I'd take Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel over Andre Drummond. Hell, maybe even Taj Gibson too. Andre Drummond is REALLY bad."
Mitchell Robinson.
Mitchell Robinson
And this is with Mitchell Robinson missing a lot of games. This Knicks team is fucking nice.
"Right because exactly the 31st pick is what i‚Äôm talking about. Just look at the 2018 draft, far back enough to evaluate whether these players are good and still relatively recent. In the 31-40 range, good young players like Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson were taken and rotation players like Bonga and Carter"
"Yep shows you know absolutely nothing about the NBA. LMFAO. GTFOH don't know who Mitchell Robinson is. After that this will be my last response. I knew you were pretty fucking dumb and had terrible takes, but the lack of basketball intelligence just showed massively there."
None of those guys except maybe trae could be a franchise cornerstone or franchise player like JJJ. And JJJ is a deadlier 3pt shooter than trae sooooo...also who the fuck is Mitchell Robinson???
"&gt;??????????????????????????????????????????????? 2nd BEST?????????????????????  I would take, trae, Shai, Ayton and Mitchell Robinson over him. He would just beat out MPJ and collin sexton slightly."
and future mvp immanuel quickley and future DPOY mitchell robinson
I‚Äôll take 11-3 and no Mitchell Robinson
Lakers have Lebron and AD. Knicks have Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson.
I'm assuming he's an elite rim runner? Gobert is what I'm hoping Mitchell Robinson becomes or at least close to it.   Gobert is probably up there with Jokic and Embiid. Defense doesn't put asses in seats in sports though. Fans kind of harm sports in this case.
"We are essentially playing with house money this year. We were projected to be a bottom 3 team this year. We are building within and focusing on the development of guys like RJ ( who I believe will be an all star), Randle, IQ and Mitchell Robinson. We also have great cap flexibility where we can position ourselves for a Star FA this year or potentially next year."
"But within the next 2-3yrs that Knicks team becomes expensive.   Noel is a Free Agent this offseason along with a few others.   Randle is a FA next offseason along with Mitchell Robinson. Randle will likely be in the $30m+ Max deal and who knows what Robinson gets.   The following offseason it‚Äôs time to pay Barrett who will be in the final year of his Rookie deal.    The next 2 Offseasons aren‚Äôt even filled with a ton of ‚ÄúStar‚Äù talent.   Nets were in a similar position but lucked into Kyrie and Durant. If they didn‚Äôt sign them the Nets would still likely have a version of that D‚ÄôLo Playoff Roster except way more expensive.   If the Knicks want a ‚ÄúStar‚Äù then trading a combo of Barrett, Quickley, and Robinson plus picks will most likely be needed.   Nets fans didn‚Äôt want to give up LeVert and Allen but we got Harden."
"It would be really tough without giving up basically every pick we have.  Plus, it's going to be tough to include Mitchell Robinson in a trade this summer because of the nature of his contract.  If the Knicks pick up his team option for next season they get him on the minimum but then he becomes an UFA in 2022.  If they don't pick up his team option, he's an RFA this summer.  So a team trading for him would need to either pay him before he plays a game for them, or get him on the minimum but risk him leaving for nothing after 1 year.  It's pretty tough to make a player in that circumstance the ""centerpiece"" in a trade for a star.  Also, I'm not sure what star is on the market right now."
I know I'm biased but you're tripping if Immanuel Quickley (25th) and Mitchell Robinson (36) aren't near the top of your list...
Rj barrett   Julius Randle   Mitchell Robinson   Immanuel Quickley
Mitchell Robinson is freakishly athletic. He‚Äôs really agile and explosive for a 7 footer.
It‚Äôs good with context. Elite players from the 2000‚Äôs have horrible TS% and efficiency in general compared to nowadays. Yet you see a lot of people compare across eras. Also shot attempts matter. Some people act like Mitchell Robinson having the highest TS% of all time was super impressive when he took less than 6 FGA/G.
"I was talking about ceiling vs floor. If Wisemans ceiling as a rim runner was Gobert, Lamelos comparable ceiling based on the talents he showed would have to be much higher than Rubio, possibly a Luka level player. You could see him having the talent to score and create, and if those talents hit you have a player who can carry your team to competence single handedly. Wiseman on the other hand gets you at absolute best an Anthony Davis, who while a superstar needs a Luka level player next to him to really maximize him to the best level.   Lamelos floor would‚Äôve been something like Rubio. Wisemans is Mitchell Robinson without the defense. So maybe you draft him based on that, but that would make them idiots for drafting based on players worst case scenarios."
I'd love to see some sort of swap of Wiseman for Mitchell Robinson and then other pieces to make that work
Nba front offices are very risk averse. Its also why Mitchell Robinson fell to the second round
Tbh I think it would work well on defense. The Knicks roster rn doesn‚Äôt have any elite defenders besides MAYBE Nerlens Noel or Mitchell Robinson. As long as Demar tries like he has in San Antonio it can work.
Knicks were missing Derrick Rose for the first game and Mitchell Robinson for the second.  A starter and another guy who can be a starter and plays big minutes.  And yet the Hawks still lost both games.  We had a starter missing just like you did but still won.
"As a Nets fan it‚Äôll be interesting to see how the Knicks build this out.   Realistically they have until next offseason until things start getting expensive and the FA Classes aren‚Äôt that amazing.   This offseason they need to make a decision on Noel, Rose, Etc.   Next offseason they have to pay Randle a $30m+ Max while he has a significant Cap Hold. As well as Mitchell Robinson and Kevin Knox who will have a much lesser Cap Hold.   The following offseason is Barrett‚Äôs new contract.   That Knicks team can become fairly expensive over these next few year‚Äôs especially with a terrible FA class this year and a bunch of Player Options the following year.    I still think the NY Media is the biggest negative of being a Knick. Plus all the traveling between MSG and the Practice facility. It‚Äôs like 45min without traffic so players either live and practice in West Chester then travel for the games or live and play in Manhattan and travel for practice.    Nets on the other hand have everything easily accessible and located in Brooklyn plus the NY Media downplays them. If you were a SuperStar would you rather hear about how you‚Äôre a bum for not winning NY a Championship or enjoy the NY Market with less pressure?   As bad as it‚Äôll be for this Nets team if they don‚Äôt win it all it would have been 100x worse if this same roster was on the Knicks. So many expectations for an organization that hasn‚Äôt won anything in nearly 50yrs.   I‚Äôm honestly waiting to see how long the NY Knick Fans go from loving their underdogs to expecting more from them. Melo is one of the greatest Knicks of all time but he still gets disrespected for not winning anything. I give it another 2yrs.   I think Randle will get treated more like Lin vs Melo just because he joined when they were a bad team and his massive jump in production is the reason for this Cinderella season."
"Sure, man. You can have your opinion, and I can have mine. I think Tatum is overrated. I think Mitchell is underrated. Mitchell should get serious MVP consideration, and I doubt that will happen.  Tatum shouldn't.  Neither of us run NBA teams so it's moot.  Did Tatum (while certainly inexperienced himself) beat an inexperienced Sixers team and then a Raptors team who, whole defending champs, were minus their best player from their championship run to make the ECF twice? Yes.  Did Mitchell? No. He lost to the Harden Rockets twice and the Bubble Nuggets. By no means bad times, though understandable that last year seemed a bit of a bust at the time.  Ultimately, though, I think Denver was just much better than they were/are given credit for.  Sorry the Celtics lost so many games to injury. Ever heard the saying ""The best ability is availability""? We've certainly been lucky this season. Even the Mitchel Robinson injuries have been a blessing in disguise because they allowed Nerlens Noel to play a lot more and show his surprisingly high value.  Sorry my hot takes don't jive with your Celtics bias."
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5. Jaren Jackson Jr  6. Colin Sexton  7. DeAndre Ayton  8. Mikal Bridges  8. DeVonte Graham  9. Gary Trent Jr  10. Mitchell Robinson  11. Miles Bridges  12. Robert Williams  13. Jalen Brunson  14.

"I agree with you tbh.. Sure he's athletic but nothing seems out of the ordinary (and the footage that do seem unreal are pretty low quality or are in very biased angles) just look at JaVale McGee or Mitchell Robinson highlights and come back to this. sure Wilt was ahead of his time in size and athleticism which let him dominate weaker opponents, but the quality of the NBA has gotten so much better. Not even joking but if we hypothetically teleported average players like JaVale, Mitchell Robinson, Hassan Whiteside, Jarrett Allen, or Drummond back to the 60's, all of these guys would be another Wilt, so I don't get the argument why people would pick him over modern day superstars who are way ahead in nutrition, training, and skill (unless you hypothesize that Wilt grows up again with modern day training which is asking too much)"
"Me. It seemed like another year of no hope. Was sick of Julius Randle already, was unsure how RJ would develop, Austin Rivers was our starting pg. Figured if Knox and Frank were busts, that would be that. I was excited for the return of basketball after the bubble, but was really only excited to watch Mitchell Robinson and Obi Toppin. I thought I‚Äôd check out mid-season."
"I appreciate that you have a different opinion and don't appear to be trolling and actually genuinely think this. I just disagree.  RJ looks like he's on Tatum's career path. He has so far lived up to expectations and if he takes another jump next year, which I think he definitely will barring injury, it would be a waste to trade him away.   Robinson is a legit interior defender. He actually is great defending the 3 as well, though obviously we don't want him out there regularly.    IQ has shown a lot of promise as a rookie. Much more than Toppin. He has for stretches looked better than RJ last year and is one of the best rookies we've had in recent memory along with RJ and Porzingis.  Uncanny ability to draw fouls and being a top 10 FT shooter (as a rookie is insane) is also an underrated aspect of his game.  As I said before, only Book, Luka or Donovan Mitchell for me."
Devonte Graham and Mitchell Robinson are lottery and you think Duncan Robinson is a reach?
"Mitchell Robinson is getting drafted after Miles Bridges, Duncan Robinson, Jalen Brunson, 100% of the time  edit: also Devonte Graham is going after the 3 guys i mentioned imo"
Sign and trade for Mitchell Robinson
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he‚Äôs too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he‚Äôs probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it‚Äôll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He‚Äôs already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
In a jazz game Mitchell Robinson was called for a goal-tend and he screamed ‚Äúwhat the fuck!‚Äù
RJ Barrett? Immanuel Quickley? Mitchell Robinson?  Do you think we‚Äôre doing this with mercenaries?
What if the Knicks trade back for Porzingis to form a ‚Äòbig ball‚Äô lineup? This would be beneficial because Porzingis could play with other 3‚Äôs and wouldn‚Äôt have to bump down low with the other big men.   Their next year lineup would be:   PG: Immanuel Quickley   SG: RJ Barrett   SF: Kristaps Porzingis   PF: Julius Randle   C: Mitchell Robinson
DraftKings doesn't even list him in their DPOY betting odds but have his injured teammate Mitchell Robinson at +50000 lol
The knicks' best defender was out (Mitchell Robinson) and our starting 3 was out as well (Burks) lmao. The game was still close before trae young went down too. This is just straight up delusional. They may be more stacked but you can't discredit 3 straight wins over them. I can give you just as many reasons why the knicks were at a disadvantage today. We were on the 2nd game of a b2b and we had like 5 games this past week.   See? Playing the excuse game is fucking dumb when they lost 3. IN. A. ROW. To us.
&gt; Its too early to tell if they have long term building blocks besides Randle imo.  RJ Barrett &amp; Mitchell Robinson  Immanuel Quickley might be there as well
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
"2018 had Ayton, Luka, JJJ, Trae, Sexton, Shai, MPJ who could all be stars / already are.   Then you also have very good other picks in the two Bridges, DiVincenzo, Timelord, Graham, GTJ, Mitchell Robinson, WCJ and others.   I‚Äôm going 18."
"all this without mitchell robinson impresses me.  not like he is an offensive force, but Noeland Taj  have been taking care of big man duties quite nicely.  Add Mitchell in a few weeks and these guys are anchors"
Noah Vonleh and Mitchell Robinson*
I think they win a lot of those with Mitchell Robinson. I doubt they get out of the East but its 100% possible they upset someone as the 6 seed
"Incoming Knicks fans with the Frank, Mitchell Robinson, and 2nd round pick for Zion trade proposals"
We've had a few injuries. Most notably Mitchell Robinson who has been out with his 2nd injury this season.
Mitchell Robinson baby
Rob Williams &gt; Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell Robinson and Alex Burks?
"There might not be as many injuries total, but it certainly has affected a lot more star players than in the past, which is why people probably think there have been more injuries.  Not even done with the season yet and we have had Steph, LeBron, AD, Mitchell, Embiid, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Murray, Dinwiddie, LaMelo, Hayward, Lavine, Jerami Grant, Wiseman, Oubre, Klay, Eric Gordon, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Drummond, Oladipo, Mitchel Robinson, and SGA miss significant time."
Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson.
Mitchell Robinson for Wiseman sounds fair üòú
That was in december and yall had mitchell robinson
"At least you got a first from us for him. You drafted Jusuf Nurkiƒá and traded him(with Gary Harris) for Doug McDermott. You then traded McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second(Mitchell Robinson) for Joffrey Lauvergne, Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne. All those guys left the team that offseason."
I wasn‚Äôt part of that crowd. I was part of the crowd that said ‚Äúlol‚Äù when they played the Lakers   The knicks also don‚Äôt have a jimmy butler   Are you honestly telling me that Randle can deliver outstanding performances   Rj can be consistent in a limited series   Mitchell Robinson doesn‚Äôt get into foul trouble  early in games vs Giannis  And that Rose will get out of his bad slump?
"With all the injuries we've had with Mitchell Robinson and Noel, Gibson has literally been our savior at the C spot. One of the most fundamentally sound roleplayer centers atm."
Mitchell Robinson for MVP? üëÄ He shot 74% last year
"He looks good in PnR but we also have Mitchell Robinson, arguably the best lob threat in the league. I don‚Äôt think at any point our FO thought, or should‚Äôve thought, that Obi should be the main PnR/pop guy, even tho that was his role in college. If he can‚Äôt play like a wing almost like most modern 4s, then he‚Äôs out of place on over half the teams in the league. I believe he can but still be passed on some obvious picks to draft him. I‚Äôm rooting for him but we botched that pick imo."
"Worst of all, Mitchell Robinson missed the entire playoff series recovering from a fractured foot."
Knicks lost Mitchell Robinson and his backup Noel was hobbled too
"I switched from Lopez to Turner, but you might be right. You may not need 3 centers if you also have AD. Then you can bring in someone like Mitchell/Tatum/Zion/Kyrie/Beal/Trae  I'd pick those guys over Duncan Robinson lol"
Is Mitchell Robinson even good
Yea but Mitchell Robinson tho
Agreed.  Mitchell Robinson was better than Jokic for stretches this year.
"You can account for pace using per 100 possessions. Just comparing their most productive seasons:  19-20 Middleton: 32/9/7 on a 62 TS%  06-07 Johnson: 32/5/5 on a 56 TS%  There's also PER, which is generally a really flawed stat but at least attempts to tell you how a players' volume stats/efficiency compares to others in the league. Middleton was over 21 last year while Johnson never cracked 20. And these guys are both heavy minute, high usage players so it's not like we're comparing Mitchell Robinson and an All-Star  Johnson was a better player and stats won't completely capture that but my point is you don't just have to throw your hands up and say ""welp nothing we can do"" in terms of statistical analysis just because two players played 10 years apart. We can still see how they compared statistically relative to their peers."
"Depends. If you're looking for upside it's Kai, but honestly with Mitchell Robinson this seems kinda not that sexy. Jared Butler would be a better pick than Cooper if you're looking for immediate impact, which fits what the Knicks need now. Cooper's shooting is a very hazy mystery."
Lol I was thinking Mitchell Robinson‚Ä¶. Also I had to get to 10 even though I only really had 9 that were obvious to me just for my own satisfaction
"none of them, Timelord is Mitchell Robinson but Celtic fans act like he‚Äôs Deandre Ayton"
You're missing the GOAT Mitchell Robinson
"The Knicks had the #1 team defense in the league this year and none of their players except Mitchell Robinson would even sniff an All Defense team, and Robinson missed like half the season."
RJ Barrett   Julius Randle  Steph Curry   Mitchell Robinson   Me
You forgot Mitchell Robinson.
1. Trevor Booker  2. Mitchell Robinson  3. Chase Young
Mitchell Robinson
"I'd say that the fans overrate Blocks in general, Mitchell Robinson was hunting for blocks (and fouls) early in his career and while he would post gaudy numbers that didn't meant the team's defense benefited from this; this season played better playing team defense and altering shots with his presence and rebounding rather that making a highlight block."
1. Derrick rose  2. RJ Barrett  3. Julius Randle  4.  Immanul Quickley  5. Mitchell Robinson   They deserve it more than anyone else
"The 13th pick is always an interesting one, too. Karl Malone (1985), Jalen Rose (1994), Kobe (1996), Zach LaVine (2014), Devin Booker (2015), and Donovan Mitchell (2017).   Also some recent guys with decent careers so far, from Ed Davis (2010) to Markieff Morris (2011) to Kelly Olynyk (2013) to Tyler Herro (2019).  Fair share of duds though, with Papagiannis (2016), Kendall Marshall (2012), Jerome Robinson (2018), and most of the 2000s picks save Richard Jefferson and Thabo."
If healthy Mitchell Robinson.
"That depends on what you look for in a team to root for. Most my teams are picked from video games like NBA jam or NFL blitz. I root for the San Antonio Spurs, because that was my team on NBA jam. Loved David Robinson and sean Elliot. The years with Duncan were fantastic and he was the most humble superstar ever, helping them to be one of the best run franchises ever. With all their players falling in line behind Duncan. If your teams best superstar is humble and okay with getting yelled at, that sets the tone for everyone.  Hawks have Clint capella who is Swiss, so that can give you some national pride. Trae young is an up and coming star.  Jazz seems to have always been a well run franchise. Drafting homegrown players, and good on player development. They've always been respectable, but never won a championship. They have the historic Stockton/Malone years, Williams/Boozer years, now Mitchell/Gobert, and we're the #1 seed. I wish them luck.  Sun's have a good up and coming cast with one of the best Pure-PGs ever. Personally I'm not a fan, but respect Chris Paul. Booker is an amazing scorer, and they have had some high picks and drafted well.  Clippers are mostly just the step-child of LA, and I honestly believe they are cursed. I appreciate Kawhi's game and hold not much ill will for leaving my Spurs, but would def smirk if they lose again. Plus I'm not happy with the way they are run. Don't think their coach is that great, and don't like their team chemistry.  Nets are a a great team, but only bandwagon people would pick them. Harden has been balling lights out, and is def beautiful to watch since he joined the nets. Since his college days KD has always had the potential to be the best scorer in NBA history. Irving is a terrific basketball player, but questionable human being....   They all have +/- reasons. In the end the choice is yours. The other teams i haven't followed much tbh. Currently rooting for the Jazz, because i think they deserve it."
"I would say that 2018 could be seen as better than 2003.(depending on the development of 3rd year players- very speculative as you can imagine) 2018 is imo deeper than 2003 as well as featuring two guards that probably will be HoF barring injuries and Deandre Ayton who still could become a All-NBA center. Shai and MPJ and possibly even Sexton and JJJ might become Allstars  one day. Mikal, Mitchell Robinson and Timelord might make a defensive team or two in the future.And that is not even considering the tons of good role players in this class. Especially if Doncic and Trae become all timers I think this class could easily be Top 3"
theoretically if we drafted luka we probably take Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd round that year and try to sign Clint capela. so we would be pretty good either way
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
"Knicks give up Immanuel Quickley, Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, and 4 picks for Dame"
"I didn‚Äôt like him in NY either, not because of anything he did but simply because he sucked and got outperformed by an extremely raw Mitchell Robinson"
"The Knicks roster is vastly worse than the Suns and the Jazz on paper and we improved by 24 wins (in a shortened season btw) with few roster acquisitions or players returning from injury (in fact, we lost Mitchell Robinson to injury). Thibs deserved it as much as Monty or Snyder would've"
literally none of them were born lol... drummond is easily the decrepit old man of that group and he was born in 93  Hell a couple of those guys still werent born for the 96 olympics. Mitchell Robinson was like a couple months old when MJ retired from the bulls after the 98 season
"curry, lillard, westbrook, beal, butler derozan for guards (im guessing that suns and nets go pretty far, slot trae in for westbrook depending on how far the hawks go, mitchell for derozan depending on how far the jazz go.  tatum, zion, hayward, draymond, ingram, randle, adebayo, mitchell robinson and turner.  depending on how far the clippers go you can slot pg and kawhi in for hayward and mitchell.  starting five like curry/lillard/tatum/zion/adebayo"
I say Mitchell Robinson if NY is interested in a sign and trade
"Don't disrespeft Mitchell Robinson like that.  Out of all those names, he's probably the only one to give any good consistent production."
&gt;      Andre Drummond      Montrezl Harrell      Kyle Kuzma      Julius Randle      Mitchell Robinson      Duncan Robinson  We got a fucking squad now boys
I prefer Mitchell Robinson over Nurkic
"Mitchell Robinson sign and trade, RJ, Quickley, 3 picks. 2 1st, 1 2nd."
&gt; as the winners of staying healthy in the regular season.  That's funny.  Mitchell Robinson missed over 45 games.  Rose even after the trade missed 12.  Burks missed 23.
"I'm assuming Knicks would have to offer Mitchell Robinson? Or perhaps Alex Burks, and draft capitol?"
"From what I've heard recently (from Ian Begley), we seem to be targetting Kendrick Nunn then its Lonzo and Devontae Graham.   All year I've heard that Knicks were super interested in Myles Turner. I'd imagine we'd be swapping the younger and cheaper Mitchell Robinson+something else for Turner.  Lastly, Knicks seem to be just waiting for that 1 disgruntled star (like Harden this season).  Maybe Wizards decide to trade Beal and Westbrook next season b4 they lose them in free agency. Maybe Zach Lavine becomes disgruntled (doubt it). Heck, maybe Clippers move to Seattle and Kawhi asks out this offseason lol.  Honestly, i have only recently started thinking about the Knicks offseason so I'll probably change my mind a lot until August 3rd."
"Isn't Mitchell Robinson a restricted free agent this off season?   Anyway, we ain't trading him unless we get a big back or hes part of a package for a star. His size and ability to score around the rim is something neither Taj or Noel can provide."
Absolutely no way he deserves a max. The Knicks will let him walk if he wants a max contract. They‚Äôd be better off shooting their shot with Beal in free agency then paying Mitchell Robinson a max
"2018 could be top 5 potentially, it's got quality and depth. Ayton, Luka, Trae all have HOF potential. MPJ, SGA, Sexton, JJR, Mitchell Robinson all have all star potential too. Then u got decent role players in both Bridges, Timelord, Divencenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr, Bruce Brown &amp; Shake Milton near the end of the draft. K Nunn and Duncan Robinson went undrafted this year too. Had so much fun with this class in 2kmygm."
**Kobe vs Wade** - Kobe  **Duncan vs  Garnett** - Tim Duncan  **Dirk vs  Robinson** - Dirk Nowitizi  Some of my own:   **James Harden vs Kevin Durant**  **Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker vs Bradley Beal**  **Rudy Gobert vs KAT**  **Jimmy Butler vs Kyrie Irving**
"that draft was so deep. Robert Williams, Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte' Graham, Jalen Brunson were all picked between 27 and 37"
"Obi Toppin is a big piece you could include, or even Mitchell Robinson, but I'm not sure how the Knicks feel about Robinson's value."
"It‚Äôs 5 am here, I‚Äôm dreaming and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.   They trade Dame to the Knicks for 5 firsts, IQ and Toppin. We get Kawhi has a FA and next season our starting 5 is Dame, RJ, Kawhi, Randle, Mitchell Robinson.   Just let me sleep, don‚Äôt wake me up."
we were mostly healthy except for Mitchell Robinson (both hand and ankle injuries) who we would have loved to use during the Hawks series
"Luka, Ayton, SGA, Trae, JJJ, MPJ, Bridges, Mitchell Robinson feel like locks above him and Sexton, Bridges no. 2, Bruce Brown, Trent Jr., Huerter, Lonnie Walker, DiVincenzo, Brunson all have cases for being more valuable as NBA players so almost assuredly not. Rip Kangz."
"Very excited to see what the Knicks do to build on this in the offseason. They have some key FAs but plenty of cap space and picks to build around so they can be even better next year (50 wins?) they need more offensive firepower and one great individual defender so they can deal with guys like Trae Young. Randle and Barrett seemed like they weren‚Äôt ready for the playoffs but they can still be built around, along with Rose, Mitchell Robinson, IQ, Toppin"
"I do have a few concerns about their future. Randle didn't have a bad game or two in this series, he was bad every game. Makes me wonder if teams will figure him out next season now that they have tape of how to stop him in 5 straight games. The other concerns is really the roster. Thibs really got a ton out of very little. Taj is up there in age, Rose is best coming off the bench and is gonna be a year older, Elfrid and Noel have no offensive game, Burks was good but hes been a journeyman since leaving the jazz. Thibs needs to find out what hes got in Toppin and Knox. Those two didnt get much playing time. Ideally i like to see thibs give knox and obi more minutes, mitchell robinson is healthy, knicks have a decent draft, Immanuel quickley develop further, and either sign a couple of star players or sign a bunch of shooters because Randle either needs to be a #2 or 3 option, or if hes gonna be the number one guy, he needs a bunch of shooters to space out the floor. So he has more room to operate or kick it out to them."
Mitchell Robinson at backup C to Embiid üò©üò©
"We had an amazing season. Anyone that says differently is a fool or a troll. Nobody expected this team to be .500 much less a playoff team. We grinded and busted our asses to get to this point. We just got matched up against a better team.  Shout out to Nate McMillan. The man perfectly game planned for the Knicks and they had no answer. I‚Äôd like to say with Mitchell Robinson it would be a different series but that‚Äôs probably not as true as I would like to believe. The real difference maker is our leader and captain getting destroyed by pressure. ATL had a plan for Randle and he couldn‚Äôt figure it out. As the series advanced Randle looked more under pressure passing up open shots, hesitating and just second guessing himself. Towards the end of the series Randle took more interest in fighting the other team and Bullock joined him. When your team leaders are not focusing on ball the team won‚Äôt win. Towards the end they didn‚Äôt defend, didn‚Äôt rebound and stopped moving off ball. We had a nice run towards the end of the game but as soon as Randle came in, the game ended. Dude was straight up lost under the pressure.  It was a great series and a great learning experience for the team. Hopefully Randle figures it out. I know RJ will keep growing. I can only hope Randle does the same. As for the off season, and moving forward, the team needs better leadership. We need a guy who can be the guy. I don‚Äôt think Randle is there yet. There are a hand full of other things missing but we gotta look at it in more detail and we got time to do it. It‚Äôs been an incredible season y‚Äôall. We will be back better next season."
I mean y‚Äôall have been missing Mitchell Robinson nearly the whole year so it just wasn‚Äôt relevant when evaluating the team.
"Rarely see anyone outside of knicks fans mention the fact that the Knicks are missing Mitchell Robinson, that's a huge loss against Capela."
Thibs is just watching this no effort team and is okay with it. Mitchell Robinson has been healthy for two weeks now and he won't let him play. We have zero effort from what is suppose to be a high energy team
"Knicks spent their whole season playing really hard and playing good defense. Combine that with a young team guys are gonna accumulate season long fatigue. Combine that with what seems like no offenseive gameplan which is pretty typical thibs offense. Combine that with bad shooting, Randle getting stun locked. The knicks weren't gonna last long, losing Mitchell Robinson didn't help either."
Mitchell Robinson is a nice piece but Clint is a borderline top 5 center in the league
I wonder what this series looks like if Mitchell Robinson is healthy
Mitchell Robinson.
How does this series go if Mitchell Robinson is healthy?
Ahh yeah forgot all about Mitchell Robinson. They need him desperately
He actually helped Mitchell Robinson out a lot.. helped him figure out how to stop fouling so much.
"Used to call Mitchell Robinson Big Bird too, may we never forget."
"I'm rooting for you guys, but I think it's going to be really interesting what you do with that payroll. Kawhi is really the only top FA this year, and I doubt the Knicks land him. Other than him, you got a bunch of aging guards like CP3, Conley, Lowry and DeRozan. CP3 and Conley are in great situations, so I doubt they'd be leaving their teams unless they get grossly overpaid. Lowry is either staying with the Raptors or going to Miami, do you really want to give DeRozan a big contract at this point?   Say you don't sign any big names this season and preserve capspace. What do you do about your current expiring contracts? Guys like Rose/Burks/Bullock/Noel all played big roles in getting the Knicks to the 4th seed, and all of them are looking for their next contract. How much are you expecting to pay them? Can you keep them on cheap/reasonable contracts or do you just let them go if they're too expensive? Can you find replacements for them?   The Knicks were also relatively healthy this year with their two best players playing almost all of the games while teams like the Celtics, Hawks and the Raptors were hit hard with COVID/injuries. How confident are you at keeping the 4th seed once the Hawks, Celtics and Raptors get healthy and re-tool in the off season?   The good news is that RJ took a huge step this year, Obi Toppins actually started to look like a NBA player in stretches during the playoffs, and hopefully you'll have Mitchell Robinson back healthy next year. Where do you guys expect them to be in their development next year?   IMO the best bet for you guys is to aim for Beal in the 2022 FA and pair him with Randle. Ideally you'll have some good role players signed on reasonable contracts, keep a max space for Beal, then go over the cap to sign Randle &amp; extend Mitch, and hope your young players take the next step to stardom.   Ideally by that time you've got a trio of Beal, RJ, Randle at the helm with a good supporting cast."
"Knicks are not seriously regressing lol IQ and RJ are still young and Mitchell Robinson barely played this year.  Randle was likely over performing during the regular season but he isn‚Äôt this bad he‚Äôll likely even out, maybe he might even do it this series"
I wish Mitchell Robinson wasn‚Äôt injured it would have been nice to see him battle with Capella. Because he owned Clint during the regular season.
Mitchell Robinson needs to start playing point guard
Mitchell Robinson. Mitch‚Äôs skillset is harder to replace
Y‚Äôall are fucking delusional it‚Äôs hilarious. Mitchell Robinson sucks and he definitely isn‚Äôt going to stop our PNR offense.
"If we had Mitchell Robinson, those floaters would be a non-factor and lobbing it to Clint would be a non-factor.  It would completely change the game if we had an elite 7 foot monster protecting the paint, with Nerlens coming off the bench."
"Mitchell Robinson healthy and an actual starting SF, Knicks will be right back in the mix for the playoffs again next year.   Sounds crazy, but I'd trade Randle to a team like Boston for a starting caliber SF and another vet or prospect. I could see a Fournier + Smart &amp; FRP for Randle trade:   Quickley, Barrett, Obi, M-Rob + (wing)"
"I think part of it is that the Knicks actually don‚Äôt have that much talent. Outside of Rose, Randle, and Barrett (maybe Mitchell Robinson in there when healthy) the rest of the team is either below average role players who completely overachieved this season or young guys who have potential but lack consistency. That‚Äôs allowing the Hawks to put multiple bodies on Randle and force him into taking bad shots, which seems to have destroyed his confidence right now. The Hawks came into the series with an almost perfect strategy and New York hasn‚Äôt responded.   I think it‚Äôs also important to point out that they balled out the entire season in front of empty arenas and now Randle and Barrett are in the playoffs for the first time in front of packed arenas with all the pressure of Knicks playoff basketball. Doesn‚Äôt excuse just how terrible Randle has been but there‚Äôs definitely some context to it rather than the knee-jerk ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an overrated fraud‚Äù reactions most people have been coming with. I hope he gets his opportunity to rebound - his first ever playoff series shouldn‚Äôt make our break him - but I do agree with you that it‚Äôs hard to see the Knicks as being this good next season unless they make some big changes to the roster."
Mitchell Robinson is ready to go. Get him on the floor and get Gibson off
mitchell robinson from 10 feet away
"Knicks actually. Model was and is super low on their title odds based on its player evaluations, especially with Mitchell Robinson out."
MVP: Julius Randle  MIP : RJ Barrett  DPOY: Mitchell Robinson  6Moty: Immanuel Quickley  ROY: Jared Butler  COTY: Tom Thibodeau  EOTY: Leon Rose
"Horford might have always been good, but he became an elite defender later in his career. There‚Äôs really not many examples I can think of... Ibaka stopped hunting blocks as he got older. Mitchell Robinson could only be in games for like 5 minutes at a time due to fouls and now, before he got hurt, he was the inside anchor of the best defense in the league. I still don‚Äôt really trust him half the time but it is a significant improvement."
Besides RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson‚Ä¶ who else is under contract to even make that trade?
"tbh the knicks have four legit NBA players under 24 (RJ, Quickley, Obi, Mitchell Robinson) and Randle is only 26 and clearly still improving.  They also have the second lowest salaries on the books in the league, along with all their own picks plus two Mav picks in the next 3 years.  I think they're looking pretty healthy, and clearly have an awesome work-hard culture there now.  Not sure if all that is possible with two of the most polarizing personalities in the NBA. I think they might be better off.   In any case their future looks great right now."
Those are some rookie Mitchell Robinson numbers.
Hawks are still in control of this series but this was a must win and they got it done. Now we have to at least split in Atlanta.   Randle and RJ need to figure it out. Mitchell Robinson was also a GTD. Would be huge to have him back.
"Noel played in game one. He's not some game-changing player. You're thinking of Mitchell Robinson, who isn't coming back this series."
"DeMar DeRozan and Chris Paul have a path to the Knicks if Dolan wants to pay.   A big 3 of CP3, Randle and DeMar rounded out by Mitchell Robinson, Barrett and Quickley is a damn legit squad."
i wonder how big of a contract they will give mitchell robinson. obvious talent but they made the playoff push while he was injured.
"Alright, deploy Mitchell Robinson then"
Mitchell Robinson used to be crazy at blocking 3‚Äôs.   Hopefully he can return from injury 100%
Jarrett Allen and I'd take Mitchell Robinson over him as well.
"Elfrid Payton, Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson, Frank Ntlikina and a couple picks"
He has the 7th highest value over replacement in the 2018 draft class. 1. Doncic 2. Trae 3. SGA 4. Mikal Bridges 5. Mitchell Robinson 6. Ayton He also has the 7th most win shares behind the same 6 players.
"nah i feel you. i forgot that two of those games were in the pre-McMillan era.  the Knicks struggled with injuries to key players too (like missing Mitchell Robinson for almost the entire season), but again, i forget whether those injuries overlapped with the Hawks games.  In any case, I was just saying that were it not for an amazing bench performance, the Knicks might have been embarrassed on their home floor, and the reg season results didn‚Äôt really predict that.  a huge difference maker was Bogdanovic.  He hit some bigtime shots including that cold-blooded three in the final minutes of the 4th with pressure from Barrett.  That had to have swung their winning chances considerably."
"Turner for a disgruntled Donovan Mitchell. Think of that Gobert/Turner front court it'd be like Duncan/Robinson 2.0! Or Turner for Duncan Robinson. Think of that Bam/Turner front court, so spooky."
Mitchell Robinson?
Also a Mitchell Robinson extension
"It‚Äôs such a deep class too. You got Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, Shake Milton, De‚ÄôAnthony Melton, Alize Johnson all carving out solid careers or showing flashes as second-round picks. 2018 might just turn out to be one of the best classes ever tbh."
i wish we had mitchell robinson rn man capela is a fucking problem
Any chance Mitchell Robinson returns for this series?
Any chance Mitchell Robinson returns this series??
Damn if Mitchell Robinson was healthy knicks could have mad a trip to ecf.
Seeing video of Mitchell Robinson hitting stepback threes in practice really did it for me.
"The picks you'd consider as your team scrapping together what was left rather than the gift that he left you because of the way he left.  Even though obviously you won't have those if he didn't want to leave.  On our side of it, he wanted out and we got Mitchell Robinson for him.  So that's more like he set us up vs he left us hanging dry.  But at some point you'd think it's enough.  Even the Raptors don't boo Vince anymore."
"Wonder why that was never on the board. But to be fair, I feel the likes of Vuc, Capela, Valanciunas, Ayton, Nurkic, Porzingis are too out of reach.  I think Wiseman would fit in the range of Drummond, Whiteside, Jarrett Allen, Robert Williams, Gafford, Mitchell Robinson. None have the upside but would be solid, win-now contributors."
Mitchell Robinson at 36   Immanuel Quickley at 25
I will take solace in knowing that the Knicks got Mitchell Robinson from trading away Melo
"Uh, keep quickley that's a lot for Dame. No point in having Lillard if it's just him d rose and Mitchell Robinson lol."
Mid-20s. I would honestly rather have Mitchell Robinson than him. Guy is 100% gonna be a bust and the warriors should trade him now

"If Portland looks to rebuild post-dame, who's going to offer a better package than 4 1sts and 3 players under 24 years old? Knicks can offer their own 1st and the Mavs from the Porzingis trade this year and 2023, plus Obi, IQ, and Mitchell Robinson."
Mitchell Robinson is better
"That is true but you have a Dame level talent for 4 years. That opens up your contention window a ton. All it takes is injuries to happen like this year and the Knicks with Dame, Randle, RJ (Hopefully) and Mitchell Robinson could easily win it."
There‚Äôs no guarantee you win with Randle as your best option. I get he was good this year but having Dame (who wants to be there and is on a 4yr contract) plus Randle and RJ and Mitchell Robinson is a really good core. Plus you guys have cap so you could still sign some guys.
Mitchell Robinson.
"I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd need to give up every young player. I think you could probably keep at least one of  Quickly, Toppin, and Mitchell Robinson. You‚Äôd probably even be able to keep 2.   IMO, RJ is a *way* better asset than Ben Simmons, so you‚Äôd only have to offer an equal number of other assets to beat the 76ers offer. Plus, you‚Äôve got more picks than any of the other possible teams, since you have two more Mavs picks. The only team that might be able to beat that is the Pelicans with Ingram and all their picks.   I admit it would be terrifying to give up RJ though. I‚Äôm not a Knicks fan, but RJ is one of my favorite young players to watch.   It‚Äôd be risky for sure, but Dame is under contract for 4 years. That‚Äôs a long time to sign free agents around him. You‚Äôd also still have a ton of cap space this season."
Paschall + 14th pick for Mitchell Robinson  Knicks can keep 19 and 21
"We should just trade 14 for Mitchell Robinson, they can keep 19 and 21"
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn‚Äôt be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That‚Äôd leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I‚Äôd rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
"This shit happens all the time. Mitchell robinson is the king of this type of stuff. Quickley of all people posted ""careful who you call 'bro'"" on ig last night. People forget that these are mostly 20-23 year old kids with social lives and families and lives outside of basketball. And i sure as hell was posting stuff like that at 20 lol, hell, 7/8 years later i still get in those moods from time to time. Now imagine if youre a multimillionaire, id wager a lot more bullshit comes out the woodwork when you got that kinda guap"
Trae...Mitchell Robinson
Specifically a Lonzo type and a Mitchell Robinson type
"the logical names are injured right now I believe. Time Lord, Myles Turner and Mitchell Robinson are on the shelf unfortunately. Jarrett Allen might be available, but either the Cavs pick up his qualifying offer or he goes into RFA."
Mitchell Robinson was hurt. Nerl stepped in and had a career year no big injuries. 30-35 mins a night. Prob 2/3 of the season. If the full year he would have been a dark horse for. DPOY. Wouldnt have won but would have got more recognition.
"I've seen more Knicks fans excited about Quickley than Obi &amp; even Mitchell Robinson. Y'al fanbase best friendship with MR ended, IQ is the new young player bestie"
Robert Williams or Mitchell Robinson? All they need is rim protection and rebounding. Robinson was even a finalist for the team.
Your overestimating Colin Sexton even if he‚Äôs miles better than Elfrid Payton.  Remember Boston had major chemistry issues and huge COVID absences.  Miami is still funky as a whole because Butler and Bam were never right at the same time.   The Knicks were largely healthy outside of Mitchell Robinson.  At the end of the day I don‚Äôt know what Sexton does especially if Randle drops off from last year which is highly possible.  Cap Space and chasing free agents seems better than locking into the 12th best point guard in the NBA if you squint.
Mitchell Robinson with a second was a steal.
Middleton and jrue both bring better d and are more used to not being the focal point. But really we need like Mitchell Robinson or someone who can actually guard the rim
"Yeah ppl shat on Gobert but it's tough when Conley and Mitchell are hobbled, really compromised tbe perimeter D on drives. Ppl think it's easy to rotate on a drive every single possession in 5-out spacing as a 7 footer. Probably only Bam and Dray that could have done it better, maybeee Mitchell Robinson"
Honestly think he'd be a great fit on the Knicks @ $8M/year. Play Mitchell Robinson when you want to emphasize defense and Drummond when you need offense. Knicks could use more PPG from center position imo and think his style would fit well with Randle/RJ
Mitchell Robinson or Jaxson Hayes for OKC
Jalen Brunson for Mitchell Robinson in a sign and trade
"You have to get a good prospect in return not just picks  - DEN: Michael Porter Jr., salary filler, 2 picks   - NOP: Brandon Ingram, 2 picks   - NYK: RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, 3 1sts   - MIN: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, 3 1sts"
Mitchell Robinson?
"His form actually looks kinda nice, I hope this actually becomes something unlike the Simmons or Mitchell Robinson videos"
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don‚Äôt compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù your rebuild"
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It‚Äôs the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don‚Äôt have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he‚Äôs 66th. He‚Äôs tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
Mo Bamba and Mitchell Robinson literally have the exact same play style and role on their team and one has done it exceptionally better since their rookie year and one is struggling for minutes on the magic
1. Ayton  2. Mitchell Robinson  3. JJJ  4. Robert Williams  5. WCJ  6. Mo Bamba  7. Bagley
Can u explain how anyone but JJJ and Deandre Ayton are better than Mitchell Robinson?
"Mitchell Robinson is the best. It has nothing to do with my flair. No, will not be elaborating. Goodnight"
I have no idea how to properly rate Mitchell Robinson
I'm curious to see how good Mitchell Robinson will be in the future
"RJ, IQ, Toppin, Knox, Ntilikina, Mitchell Robinson, and 4 draft picks?? No way. That‚Äôs an overpay by the knicks. If you want RJ then you‚Äôd probably have to get rid of IQ and 1 or 2 draft picks. That‚Äôs honestly better than most packages you can get for dame. There a few better possible packages, but for a star player, the destination matters a lot. Like the pelicans could offer a better package surrounding Ingram but I don‚Äôt think New Orleans is nearly as enticing as New York."
"Yeah that‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúmaybe Mitchell Robinson‚Äù. I would not want to give him up. The others I think are not a huge impact rn but Robinson brings a lot. However, it‚Äôs dame. Ideally you wouldn‚Äôt want to but you gotta do it for dame"
"Sounds like overpay for dame to me. But in all seriousness, I think a package like IQ, Toppin, Knox, Ntilikina, 4 draft picks, and maybe Mitchell Robinson can get it done which would make knicks seriously good rn"
"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9.

Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
They could trade Mitchell Robinson for Rudy Gobert while they're at it too
PG Immanuel Quickley  SG RJ Barrett  SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Julius Randle   C Mitchell Robinson
"Thunder gets Carmelo Anthony. Knicks got Kanter, Doug McDermott &amp; future 2nd rounder. The 2nd rounder turned to be Mitchell Robinson."
"It was pretty tight despite him going to the Nets after. He immediately took KP‚Äôs jersey number which is funny af, had a few hype dunks, and he actually mentored Mitchell Robinson and had a pretty nice impact. If I‚Äôm remembering correctly DJ‚Äôs arrival was the first time Mitch began cutting down on fouls and also putting up bigger rebounding numbers."
What about Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell Robinson also broke the record for highest fg% in a season last year
"You forget that the Knicks players are all up for new contracts fairly soon so they‚Äôre not going to have talent under cheap contracts for much longer.   Knicks have 1-2yrs before it gets expensive and this offseason is terrible for top end Free Agents.    Randle is up next season and RJ Barrett the following year. Then you have Mitchell Robinson I believe this year unless they want to risk making him an Unrestricted Free Agent. Along with Rose, Noel, Etc.   Nets were fortunate that they had players still under contract for cheap and had enough cap space to sign Durant and Kyrie before their extensions kicked in."
"Towns for Randle, Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, 2 firsts."
Mitchell Robinson played for like a week at Western Kentucky I thought
Bazley + Mitchell Robinson
&gt; they got free passes to the later rounds  Who did the Hawks avoid in rounds 1 and 2 due to injuries? Mitchell Robinson and that‚Äôs about it?
"Zion, Ja, Deaaron Fox, Westbrook, Jaxon Hayes, Mitchell Robinson, Lebron"
"I meant like total injuries, is this the most injuries in a post season? Are we counting players that didn't play in the post season at all (Mitchell Robinson as example) or just guys hurt in game? Are we just counting missed games or do play through injuries count?  I'm not saying stars don't count, I'm just asking if the claim that this post-season has the most (let alone by far the most) injuries is actually true or not.   I'm basically a little dubious about the most injuries claim and just wondering if anyone has dropped any hard data on it yet."
"You nailed it man. I'd be shocked if MPJ and Shai didn't get maxed.   Obviously, different contracts with the 2nd round but Graham and Mitchell Robinson too, that was a great great class."
He‚Äôs just Javale Mcgee / Mitchell Robinson before the game evolved
"&gt;Knicks were healthy  Hold on now. Hold on. Our starting center, Mitchell Robinson, broke his foot.  You really thought we ran Taj at C all year?"
"Lakers - AD, LeBron (played through injury)  Nuggets - Murray, Barton  Clippers - Kawhi, Morris (played through injury), Zubac, Ibaka (out for series)  76ers - Embiid (played through injury), Danny Green  Hawks - Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Bogdanovic (played through injury)  Bucks - Giannis, DiVincenzo (out for series)  Knicks - Robinson  Nets - Kyrie, Harden (played through injury), Jeff Green  Jazz - Conley, Mitchell (played through injury)  Mavs - Luka (played through injury)  Heat - Oladipo  Celtics - Jaylen, Kemba  Wizards - Avdija, Thomas Bryant, Bertans  Suns - Payne, CP3 (played through)"
lol no  Mitchell Robinson
i guess what i meant was ‚Äújust above pond scum‚Äù so we never get a high draft pick (but still have a chance to pick someone good like lillard or klay or mitchell or bam but we end up picking thomas robinson or jimmer fredette or justin jackson) except when we do and draft marvin bustley except for the last two seasons when we were actually mediocre except for this season where we legitimately looked like a g league team for stretches but we won‚Äôt fire our elementary school rec league coach because we have to have a culture of ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù üòÉüëç
Same thing happened with Mitchell Robinson. CBS upgraded him from out and it just wasnt accurate
"Knicks fans are completely overrating our core.   IQ did great for a rookie but he basically only has two ways to score and once you take away either of those things, he‚Äôs completely ineffective since his ability as an actual point guard is not great   RJ Barrett had a good season but he‚Äôs unproven as a star and his playoff performance proved it. Is he capped out as a solid starter, or can he eventually become budget Dwyane Wade? Evidence seems to point at the former.   Mitchell Robinson has basically only played half a good season, and been injured for the rest, so you‚Äôre asking to commit serious money and time to a player that‚Äôs only had half a season of actual good basketball in his career   The Knicks FO is in a more precarious position than people realize, and their newest lottery draft asset was a complete flop this year. The one year we didn‚Äôt tank was the Cade Cunningham draft, a point guard for a team that desperately needed a point guard."
"Mitchell, Barrett, Randle, Robinson and Bullock would do me nicely."
"Yeah I think he's more in the 9-22 range with a lot of room to debate.  My top 8 centers this season would be Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Adebayo, KAT, and Valanciunas. I don't think you can really put Ayton above any of them.   He's in that second tier with Kanter, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Porzingis, Ibaka, Zubac, Christian Wood, Robert Williams, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Nurkic, Steven Adams, Theis, and Al Horford.  I think Ayton is probably around the 12th-16th best center in the league, though if he keeps up the form he's had these playoffs next season I could see him making a jump into the top 10."
"Lonzo almost certainly wouldn't be involved because he's a RFA. It's possible, but complicated.   The real question is if BI goes or not.   If BI stays, a starting lineup of Dame, Lonzo, BI, Zion and Adams or Jaxson Hayes will put up record breaking offense and the only question will be defense and depth.   They can use Bledsoe and remaining picks to grab defense and depth though, targeting guys like Hield, Barnes, Duncan Robinson, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and maybe PJ Tucker.  Regardless of whl they get to fill out the roster, that's definitely a top 3 seed if healthy.   If BI goes, that'll likely leave the Pelicans with 5ish tradable 1st round picks along with 5ish swaps and at least one promising young player. Basically what the Clippers gave up for PG.   They could use those to go for the 3rd star, along with salary from Bledsoe or Adams to go after a guy like Jeremi Grant, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis, Donovan Mitchell, PG, SGA or KAT, depending on who becomes available."
"Knicks, they have the 2 first round picks from the Mavs, plus their own 2. the 2nd rounder from the Pistons (#32). As for players they have Quickley, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson (doubt they'll want to include RJ Barrett but in the right package I could see it)  Kevin Knox is 22 and needs a change of scenery. I think they have the ammo and could include pick swaps if necessary to pull it off. A point guard has been the achilles heel of this roster and I don't see another player of his caliber at the exact position of need for them coming available while Julius Randle is still in All-NBA form and the window to make a run is open"
"lmao at some of these comments being upvoted, showing how /r/nba has negative bball iq. Dude literally just won a championship playing center.   Magic Johnson traded Zubac for pocket lint and overruled our staff to draft fucking Moritz Wagner over Mitchell Robinson"
"knicks?  they DO have 5 first in the next 3 drafts.  They also got RJ, Mitchell RObinson, and Quickley with value as young guys (Knox too?  lol).  And with Thibs and the success of this season, they're gonna try and win.  &amp;nbsp;  But I don't know....Dame is 31.  Not that many years at elite levels (2 years?) and at age 33 and onward, he'll be in decline (though still probably really friggin good still...just not at his peak like he is now)."
Well you can say this is a dumb take but i really believe that putting Kobe on any team will make them better.  I really do.  Im a foreigner from another continent so i do not know about the salary cap limits.  Take the New York knicks for example.  I think they have space salary wise no?  Derrick Rose/RJ Barret/Mitchell Robinson/Julius Randle/Kobe.  The knicks struggled in the playoffs D Rose was doing good for a reason he is a former MVP.  Sometimes you need a leader or someone to take the load off other players on the court and he does that.
As the Knicks I protect  Julius Randle  RJ Barrett  Mitchell Robinson  Immanuel Quickley  Obi Toppin  Luca Vildoza   And since we'd have 8 or less under contract I'd put Kevin Knox as our unprotected pick
"He's saying the average NBA center can light it up outside of actual NBA games. If you watch shootarounds you'll see players like DeAndre Ayton and Mitchell Robinson swishing threes.   For example, [here's some workout clips of Mitch](https://youtu.be/WuwCgXSnAUI). These centers kill it every year in open runs where they can show their whole bag"
"2 of 'em.  1) Didn't think Trae Young was gonna succeed. Thought his size and defense were gonna be liabilities and his shooting would be streaky/limited by NBA defenders.   2) Thought Mitchell Robinson was gonna be an absolute bust. If I remember, he didnt really play in college and I didnt think his game was gonna be useful in the league."
"2018 is an unusually deep class. Although I don‚Äôt think it could yet be considered the greatest, you have to consider the later picks doing well: Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ, Huerter, Shamet, Brunson, Devonte‚Äô Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, and SLAM DUNK CHAMPION HAMIDOU DIALLO"
"It‚Äôs too early but it‚Äôs not crazy to think 2018 can be that caliber.  It‚Äôs not just Luka Trae Ayton it‚Äôs MPJ, JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, Robert Williams Kevin Huerter, even Bagley will probably still be very good. There‚Äôs also a lot of great role players as well throughout the draft that will likely have long careers.  Way too early to be comparing them to the all time great classes but they have an argument that they are on track to be in that convo"
"It‚Äôs insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I‚Äôm probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
Tbh Mitchell Robinson was a huge miss for us. I don‚Äôt think we win regardless but we def missed him in the middle
2018 dream. You left out Gary Trent and Mitchell Robinson
"A few more solid players to add to that list: Okogie, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Melton, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn‚Ä¶ yeah that draft class was really solid all around."
"Last year had herro, Robinson,mitchell, Murray and Caruso"
"I was surprised to find out that KAT plays for the Dominican Republic, really would prefer him to Love for adding size. Other people I think would fit better than Love include, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, and Mitchell Robinson."
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
Mitchell Robinson is a center. Cade Cunningham is a point guard.
Disrespectful as hell to no even mention Mitchell Robinson. He‚Äôs a great interior defender and very good at rim running and catching lobs
In the words of some random reply I read on a Mitchell Robinson tweet.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so the unemployed can communicated over the internet‚Äù
Mitchell Robinson with Lavine‚Äôs 46inch vert and KD‚Äôs jumper.
Mitchell Robinson has tiktoks of himself just nailing threes in gyms and I‚Äôm just like how man? Not one decent 2 in a game either
"It‚Äôs super unfair to compare Dwight Howard and Melos efficiency. Dwight has close to no post up game, all his shot were hand fed. Melo on the other hand had to create most of his shots. Mitchell Robinson shot 75% last year, but he‚Äôs not a better scorer than steph"
Mitchell Robinson will now demand the bag
"No, he could get anything up until the 25% max (potentially more if there's some rose rule language thrown into the contract) since he's a FRP.  &amp;#x200B;  Mitchell robinson is weird...he was a second round pick so he doesn't have the same pathway that most young dudes do, but I think he's already on his second contract rn. I think that means his current extension options are the standard vet. ext which would be 120% of the average player salary - probably a bit lower than what timelord got."
Mitchell robinson is top 3
"Mitchell Robinson is one of the most switchable 7 footers in the league, and an elite 3 point shot blocker.   [There's a whole Twitter thread about his capabilities here](https://twitter.com/APachecoNBA/status/1427971681063215104?s=19), but honestly I don't know why people wouldn't just acknowledge they've never watched him play rather than offering uninformed opinions."
"That's part of it, but he's also an elite verticality guy, jumps straight up without even necessarly blocking the shot but it's basically the same.  But for example feels like Turner, Nerlens, Timelord, AD or even a Mitchell Robinson have basically quicker jump/second jumps"
definitive answer:   ||PLAYER|TEAM|AGE|GP|BLK| --:|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |1|Myles Turner|IND|25|47|3.4| |2|Rudy Gobert|UTA|29|71|2.7| |3|Nerlens Noel|NYK|27|64|2.2| |4|Clint Capela|ATL|27|63|2| |5|Chris Boucher|TOR|28|60|1.9| |6|Jakob Poeltl|SAS|25|69|1.8| |7|Robert Williams III|BOS|23|52|1.8| |8|Anthony Davis|LAL|28|36|1.6| |9|Jaren Jackson Jr.|MEM|21|11|1.6| |10|Richaun Holmes|SAC|27|61|1.6| |11|Brook Lopez|MIL|33|70|1.5| |12|Mitchell Robinson|NYK|23|31|1.5| |13|Jarrett Allen|CLE|23|63|1.4| |14|Daniel Gafford|WAS|22|54|1.4| |15|Joel Embiid|PHI|27|51|1.4| |16|Kristaps Porzingis|DAL|25|43|1.3| |17|Goga Bitadze|IND|21|45|1.3| |18|Kevin Durant|BKN|32|35|1.3| |19|Hassan Whiteside|SAC|32|36|1.3| |20|Isaiah Stewart|DET|20|68|1.3| |21|Mo Bamba|ORL|23|46|1.3|
"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
Guess if he only plays in limited minutes he always looked Mitchell Robinson - Jarrett Allen tier to me
Rob is shorter because he has no neck but he's long in all the ways that matter ;)  Rob Williams wingspan - 7'6''  Mitchell Robinson wingspan - 7'4''  Rob Williams standing reach - 9'4''  Mitchell Robinson standing reach - 9'3''
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
"No.  Rob is a lot better at switching and staying with his man without fouling due to his superior athleticism and body control, but Mitch has a much bigger frame and can (with time and 20-30 pounds of muscle) body up embiid and other elite big men.  That being said neither team is good enough to be remotely competitive with the sixers/bucks/nuggets (if the nuggets make it) in a series, so for regular season play I‚Äôd say Williams is a lot better.   I just don‚Äôt see Mitchell Robinson playing harden 1v1 on the perimeter like Williams did"
I remember my team ended up being the Knicks in Myplayer the last 2k because I wanted a challenge. Mitchell Robinson was this defensive beast that bailed us out and was one of the best defensive big men in the league. Is he anywhere close to that in real life?
"I haven‚Äôt watched a ton of Robinson so I‚Äôm a bit biased here but Rob is an elite defender at the rim, excellent vision as a passer, and legitimately can jump higher than anybody on the court. Is Mitchell Robinson really that much better as a defender than Rob?"
" &gt; Now Mitchell Robinson at 36 and Shake Milton at 54 in that same draft? Those are great second round picks.  The standard you were critiquing was ""pretty fine"", not great. If you're a 2nd rounder who gets a 2nd contract, you're doing better than average for 2nd rounders. You don't need to be contributing what Shake or Robinson are for that to still be a positive"
"Wouldn't have played a minute in any playoff team's rotation this year except maybe the Eastern Conference dregs.  If he fixes his shot and figures out NBA defense over the next couple years, yeah, this is a hell of a great contract. Until then, he's indistinguishable from every other 2nd rounder.  Now Mitchell Robinson at 36 and Shake Milton at 54 in that same draft? Those are great second round picks."
"Knicks  2016 - no picks 2017 - Donovan Mitchell, Dillon Brooks 2018 - SGA, Mitchell Robinson 2019 - RJ Barrett 2020 - Obi Toppin, Immanual Quickley  I think this has been proof of how well the Knicks FO has done in the draft. I‚Äôd still take Obi over Halliburton because in the context of this prompt we wouldn‚Äôt need him.  SGA Donovan Mitchell RJ Barrett Obi Toppin Mitchell Robinson 6th man: Quickley"
2016: Dejountae Murray PG (29) 2020: Halliburton SG (11) 2017: Dillon brooks SF (29) 2019: Keldon Johnson PF (19) 2018: Mitchell Robinson C (18)  Spurs didn‚Äôt do all that bad considering where they were drafting tbh. A little bias picking Murray over Brogdon but I‚Äôm bias
2016: Pascal Siakam (wound up trading 22nd pick for Marco Belinelli- Siakam picked 27th)   2017: Donovan Mitchell (picked Monk at #11)     2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (actually picked him at #11 but swapped for Miles Bridges for a 2nd) / Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd (we got Devonte' and it was a great pick but Mitchell Robinson works better with the new team)       2019: PJ Washington at #12 (did well here) 2020: LaMelo Ball at #3 (no complaints in hindsight)  Would've been:  Ball/Mitchell/SGA/Siakam/Robinson with PJ Washington off the bench
Celtics:  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (23rd pick in 2016)  SG: Jaylen Brown (3rd pick in 2016)  SF: Jayson Tatum (3rd pick in 2017)  PF: Pascal Siakam (16th pick in 2016)  C: Mitchell Robinson (27th pick in 2018)
PG: Simmons  SG: SGA  SF: Kevin Porter Jr.  PF: Jayson Tatum   C: Mitchell Robinson  And they'd still have Embiid on the team
sga donovan rj jaden mcdaniels mitchell robinson
"No, I think it's 2019-2020 because Bobby Portis is on the court. At least I'm pretty sure that's Bobby Portis.   I recognize Frank, Dotson, Knox, Mitchell Robinson but they played on both the 2018-2019 and the 2019-2020 team"
I‚Äôm dead you just compared Mitchell Robinson to giannis. That reminded me that capella called your franchise a bunch of bitches and closed you out. Trae getting injured stopped us from beating the bucks. We were up by 10 in game 3 when trae went down. I still think we lose the series because the bucks were more talented than us but the bucks didn‚Äôt shut down any pick n roll except for game 2. Trae had 32 on great efficiency through 3 quarters in game 3.
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn‚Äôt even close y‚Äôall got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven‚Äôt seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year
"I mean if we are counting that then every team in the postseason was ""injured."" The knicks were missing their best defender Mitchell Robinson. That doesn't mean they were the injured knicks."
He‚Äôs definitely serviceable as a 2nd big man for any team imo. But this is def an overpay considering we‚Äôre gonna extend Mitchell Robinson soon
He filled in big time as the backup center after Mitchell Robinson got hurt. Definitely not the player he was but Taj was the best screener and one of the most consistent players on the roster last year.  Not totally sure why the deal got enlarged like this though haha. I'm assuming the second year is a team option and he got more $$$ per year to compensate.
"Nerlens Noel, Mitchell Robinson are top defenders at their position. Reggie Bullock was a solid defender last year, Elfrid payton (despite being garbage) is a decent defender, RJ is coming to his own on defense. Miles McBride looks like he has the tools to be a great defender."
"We also ran a ton of pick n roll against the Sixers and Embiid is a much better defender than Mitchell Robinson lmaooo. Robinson would help your defense but y‚Äôall‚Äôs offense would still be nonexistent. We gentlemen swept y‚Äôall, the series wasn‚Äôt close man. Congrats on some regular season wins when we were injured/ still coached by LP. Plz have some self awareness when calling other fans delusional"
"the knicks won more and that is reflected in the team stats. my point was Kat hasdlo malik beasly and ant edwards - knicks had barett elfrid Payton, mitchell robinson? Knicks are a better team but I would argue they are not as talented as Twolves.  Is it really impressive that KAT led the twolves to a worse season with better players?  knicks did more with less but maybe it is due to just Thibs coaching."
"Mitchell Robinson is not close to Derrick Rose you clown.  Your supposed star choking is why you lost, not because of an injury and foul prone bench center being out."
Knicks fans have some hate boner for Timelord like they have some cornered market in high flyer centers with Mitchell Robinson.
Knicks fans are talking about delusional. Y‚Äôall were saying the hawks were first round exit while we gentlemen swept you and reached the ecf. Y‚Äôall convinced yourself Julius randle was a star based on Covid regular season wins against injured teams. You might need to wait 20 more years to reach the ecf. I even heard that Mitchell Robinson would have changed the Knicks hawks series.
Mitchell Robinson is a throw in player not Rob
Mitchell freakin' Robinson. Just gotta stay healthy but I think he can really become something special under Thibs

"Can he still give you 13&amp;7 in 20min off the bench?  Last season in 25min as a starter he only gave you 12/7, hard to imagine him putting up the same numbers or better in a lesser role.  As for the Knicks, no way.  Defense was such a huge part of the reason we overachieved last year.  Our backup center is whoever doesn't start between Nerlens Noel and Mitchell Robinson, and I'd definitely rather have either of them than Love.  We did enough to bolster our offensive this offseason, we need to still keep our defense sharp."

I think you are severely underrating the addition of those two players especially when you consider who they are replacing. Kemba Walker is replacing Elfrid fucking Payton who was easily the worst starter on a playoff team last year. Drose coming on to the starting lineup ended up scrambling our second unit and making them really ineffective. Trae Young was able to hide and rest on defense because Reggie Bullock can‚Äôt dribble. You saw what he did on a 2-1 fast break in that series smfh. Replacing him with Fournier means the Trae has no where to hide. I would agree with you that our rookies aren‚Äôt going to have a big impact unless one of them really break out and Thibs gives them big mins. RJ is really the swing factor. If he has the 3rd year star wing leap then we would be in great shape. And finally we have Mitchell Robinson. He is the biggest defensive and even offensive piece we missed last year. He is one of the best if not the best lob catcher in the league which would force Capela to not shade Randle whenever he has the ball. Mitch is also one of the best rebounders in the league. His overall rebounding numbers don‚Äôt show it on the surface but he led the league in box outs and the Knicks were the best rebounding team in the league when he was healthy. All this to say that it will be a far more interesting series if we play next year and I hope it happens.
Mitchell Robinson and the whole unnatural flopping to draw a foul have to be difference makers in the next series.
Not really. Even Mitchell Robinson can do this outside an nba game
"They started with a record of 17-20 and after the Derrick Rose trade went 24-11 which is equivalent to 56 wins over an 82 game season. Their final record of 41-31 is equivalent to 47-35, the swapping of Elfrid Payton (who I cannot stress enough as a complete negative on the court) and Reggie Bullock for Kemba and Fournier as well as the improvement in the young players and hopefully healthy Mitchell Robinson means 50 wins is a realistic expectation. Kemba may not perform like he used to but is a GINORMOUS upgrade over Elfrid Payton"
"Just meaning they have majority of their first rounders and RJ is young as hell solid prospect. Quickley.. Mitchell Robinson.. when you can pair young guys with lots of 1st rounders, you have the makings to get a superstar. Pretty sure Philly is missing a lot of their first round picks in comparison"
"The ""maybe"" isn't saying we might not have to offer them, it's saying that those players might be untouchable in the Knicks FO's eyes  Even without those players you're getting Noel/Burks (both moveable contracts who would certainly be traded for more assets for the Blazers), Obi Toppin, Miles McBride, Jericho Sims, Quinton Grimes, Mitchell Robinson (5 young players), and a LOT of picks. You can decide for yourself if the Blazers would take that (I wouldn't) but it isn't the most ridiculous package ever considering what Harden went for.  I would be shocked if we get Dame without moving one or both of RJ/IQ"
"some combo of:  Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett (maybe), Immanuel Quickley (maybe), Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, any of our future picks, Miles McBride, Quinton Grimes, Jericho Sims  I don't think it beats the Sixers package if they offer Simmons + another player + picks"
Mitchell Robinson 2.0
Mitchell robinson too iirc in his second summer league
Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Montrezl Harrell  Jerami Grant
Sims is going to be the reason they don‚Äôt keep Mitchell Robinson
"Denver - Murray, MPJ, picks and pick swaps   Dallas - no realistic assets unless they'll trade Doncic   Minnesota - Edwards, picks and pick swaps (no chance they do this since they are building for the future)   New York - Barrett, Robinson, Toppin, picks and pick swaps   Sacramento - Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, picks and pick swaps (no chance they do this since they are building for the future)     The only realistic ones are Denver and New York. Is that better than Simmons, Thybulle, Maxey, 3 picks and pick swaps? Simmons can be traded for Wiggins, (Wiseman or Moody or Kuminga), plus a pick or a pick swap.      Imo, only Denver can top that if they offer both Murray and MPJ plus 3 picks and pick swaps and Warriors with (Wiggins, Wiseman, Moody, Kuminga). Warriors might not even offer all of them."
Mitchell Robinson lol
"Ok but Knicks have RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and Obi Toppin for basically that same amount. Soo‚Ä¶what are we really talking about here?"
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell Robinson
Make a team from:   Guard: Trae / Ja / Edwards / Dejounte / Halliburton/ lamelo   Forwards:  Zion / bridges / Hunter/  isaac /  Collins / MPJ / Wood / keldon / reddish  Pat Williams / JJJ   C: Ayton / Allen / Turner / Mitchell Robinson    And could take a few rookies or other sophomores
Why didn't they get a Mitchell Robinson type player for this team? I feel like even a James Wiseman would've been good.
Mitchell robinson  Kevin Knox  Kemba walker
Mitchell Robinson did his own training for a year and went from a top 10 HS player to being drafted in the 2nd round.
pre-apology for when olshey takes evan fournier mitchell robinson and kemba walker plus picks for dame at the deadline
Robert Williams is on par with Mitchell Robinson in terms of shot blocking and I‚Äôm taking Theis over Noel any day of the week.
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
They don‚Äôt play the same position‚Ä¶ you realize that right? Taj and Obi do not eat into each other‚Äôs time whatsoever. Taj is our third big who played backup a lot of the year to Nerlens because Mitchell Robinson was out. Obi backed up the guy who led the NBA in minutes. I don‚Äôt think anyone predicted Julius Randle having the season that he did.
"Mills pls, Mitchell Robinson wouldn't have caught that"
Trae - Luka - Mikal Bridges - Jaren Jackson Jr - Ayton  Sexton - SGA - MPJ - Miles Bridges - Mitchell Robinson  These two 5s are from the 2018 draft. So many great players and none of them have hit their prime yet. Imo it will go down as one of the best ever.
"Even if for some reason the Knicks acquiesced and did a sign and trade, Mitchell Robinson would not be the guy going to San Antonio. You guys can have Kevin Knox lol."
Idk shit about making salaries work but can we get Mitchell Robinson via s&amp;t somehow?
Nerlens Noel is the best for-bargain defensive anchor you're gonna get right now. He anchored the Knicks top defense when Taj Gibson wasn't on the floor(and Mitchell Robinson went down with injury). He will excel with a playoff team who has scoring options already.
"Do you think Mitchell Robinson is going to break that curse, or will he get traded/walk away as a UFA?"
Mitchell Robinson about to break the curse?
"Mitchell Robinson is a little overrated, he‚Äôs closer to Nerlens Noel than he is to a top 10 Center."
"Wow, are they done with Mitchell Robinson then? He‚Äôs either be in the deal or serve as Turner‚Äôs backup, unless they plan to play them together.  I get he had injuries but he has so much potential."
"Even more than the lack of big it was the lack of capable guards that did the team in.  Derrick Rose can't play the number of minutes required for a starting point guard in the playoffs. Quickly looks promising, but is much more a scorer than a playmaker at this point. RJ isn't really a guard at all. Elfrid Payton is simply not good enough.   If Mitchell Robinson can stay healthy (unfortunately a big if), that's one problem solved, but the Knicks haven't had competent guard play for a decade now. That'll be the difference maker next season."
I think the Knicks might entertain Mitchell Robinson for Kuminga.
"Without taking into account draft position its a pretty silly metric because generally shit teams or teams with higher picks like Celtics will be higher.   Should expect a good pick in the top 3-5 and it be a negative if they miss.   For some value picks from 2016 to 2020 (2021 too early to tell)   2016:  Raptors: Siakam at 27   Spurs: DJ at 29   Bucks: Brogdon at 36  Denver: Murray at 7    2017:   Utah: Mitchell at 13 (interestingly traded from Denver lol)  Heat: Bam at 14  Grizz: Brooks at 45   Raptors: OG at 23   Atlanta: Collins at 19  Nets: Allen at 22  Spurs: White at 29    2018:   Clips: SGA at 11  Denver: MPJ at 14  Charlotte: Graham at 34  Knicks: Mitchell Robinson at 36  Philly: Shake at 54    2019:   Spurs: Keldon at 29  Nets: Claxton at 31  GSW: Paschall at 41  Clips: Mann at 48   Too early to really tell value picks esp from 2020 on but  2020:   Kings: haliburton at 12  Pistons: Bey at 19   Heat: Precious at 20  Wolves: Mcdaniels at 28  Celtics: pritchard at 26 (at least they hype him up)    From a pure value point of view Spurs, Raptors, Denver up there.   I'd have said the spurs clear #1 based on draft position (and argument still are considering 3 hits at 29) but don't like Lonnie at 18 and Luka at 19 was a reach (tbf both still young, like Luka more than Lonnie). Vassel happy with at 11 as projected top 10. (And yes ignoring 2021)    If wanting to include 2021 and all picks then need to have Detroit, Rockets, Hornets, Celtics, Orlando, Mavs, Hawks et al and it gets messy"
"Every single draft has some big guy who is pretty decent that goes late. Claxton was pick 31. Mitchell Robinson was 36. Timelord, 27 in the same draft. Thomas Bryant went 42. Jarrett Allen went 22 the same draft. Zubac, 32nd.  2015 had Nance 27, Portis 22, Hernangomez 35, Richaun Holmes 37, Montrezl Harrell 32. The year before was Jokic at 41, Dwight Powell at 45, and Capela at 25. The year before that? Dieng was 21, Plumlee 22, Gobert 27. Before that? Draymond at 35.   Every year, there's perfectly serviceable 5s available between pick 20 and pick 45. Every year."
"Exactly this. We have been drafting ""for fit"" for years and look at where it's gotten us. Besides 2018 and 2020, Kings fans have been wrong about every draft it seems. We took Thomas Robinson ahead of Lillard due to fit. We traded down to get Justin Jackson and Harry Giles in 2017 because we already had WCS/just drafted Fox and didn't want to take one of Zach Collins, Bam, or Mitchell for ""fit"". McNair did the right thing taking who he thinks was the BPA at our position. At worst, it sets us up with tradeable assets."
Wasn‚Äôt Mitchell Robinson projected as a first then left his team after 2 games and he fell off the radar?
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
"Ayo got picked.   Sometimes when a guy you don‚Äôt scout like Sharife falls, you take him over ‚Äúyour‚Äù guy.   I remember when Mitchell Robinson fell and I was like wtf.. look what happened"
"Mitchell Robinson for #11 straight-up, who says no /s"
"Mitchell Robinson, 19 and 21 for 11 would be a W for the Hornets."
"That would be a steal honestly, Mitchell Robinson is fantastic"
Hornets will probably want Mitchell Robinson with those picks.
"But, like, he still could though. As could the next high-upside prospect you swing for.   Not that he'd have to though - even if they don't, pulling top 50-75 players out this range still happens and is very valuable - Where'd you draft Parker ffs? Ginobli? Brogdon, OG, Siakam, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, etc. were all pulled from this range recently, and that's just who we know is really good.   The point is, you gotta be taking those chances if you ever want to get a star, and the more chances you take, the more likely you find one. Esp when you've got a good track record of developing late picks and can afford the possibility of busting, continuously taking chances on these guys is good strategy. Ziarre, Keon Johnson et al could totally be one of those guys, even if it's not that likely.  Unless you think the Knicks don't have anything better to do these days than burn their stash on Derozan"
"&gt; and the Knicks are probably elated to accept the ($ 1.80 M) club option on Mitchell Robinson.  Yeah that's overly simplistic given the situation though. If the Knicks accept the option at this low salary, it seems like a great deal for the team this season given his production, but then he's totally an unrestricted FA next year. If they decline the option now, then he's a 2nd rounder version of a Restricted FA, meaning they can match on a deal that costs more this year but locks him up long term.  Agents and players in this situation tend to agitate for the 2nd option, for the max allowable of course. So choosing the first option also tends to burn bridges making losing them in UFA a year from now even more likely."
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"Lillard &gt; Trae  Randle &gt; Whoever their 2nd best guy is (Reddish/Capela/Collins/Bogi)  DeRozan &gt; Whoever their 3rd best guy is (again, take your pick)  i dont necessarily want that team but they would beat the hawks lol especially if they kept mitchell robinson somehow and just added some FA depth"
Mitchell Robinson would be doing a ton of heavy lifting.
"I think there's a solid case that Lowry/Demar in addition to the Knicks functional core of Mitchell Robinson/Orange Julius/RJ Barrett and their team defense can compete for the east.   Especially once we build some distance from the playoffs and the newness of the Bucks as champions, I don't think anyone with a straight face can say Brooklyn, Philly, or Milwaukee have a firm hold on the East heading into next year."
"I only watched a few Kings/ Knicks games all year, but if bagley stayed healthy and Mitchell Robinson stayed out of foul trouble I think they‚Äôd pair together pretty well"
"Knicks haven‚Äôt been great but we have made some decent picks like quickly, Mitchell Robinson, rj and porzingis"
"A bunch of the knicks young guys. Like Mitchell Robinson and Quickley. They aren‚Äôt super hyped up and maybe it‚Äôs because that fanbase is so large, but seriously don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so special with them.  Specifically for the pelicans, I‚Äôm not sure why the fanbase is ready to roll NAW out in the starting lineup. I think he projects to be a Jordan Clarkson/6th man spark plug guy rather than a starter."
Obi Tobbin? Frank Ntilikina? If anything I think Mitchell Robinson is inflating your average...those second round picks who ended up having any value really seem to boost the rating
Mitchell Robinson? Umm yeah I'd do that deal in a heartbeat.
Could have took an up and coming defensive big like Mitchell Robinson but they took a fading Javale instead.
"Roster was certainly poorly put together. There was a lot of talent like Zion or Ja or Fox or Young that I think should‚Äôve had a shot and would‚Äôve added a lot to this team. Christian Wood as well wouldve been interesting. Even Jarrett Allen or Mitchell Robinson. Team is seriously lacking an inside presence and a guard/wing who puts a lot of pressure on the paint. Not really a drive and kick guy on this roster. It‚Äôs really a bummer Lebron didn‚Äôt play, I get it with his age and recent injury, but he would‚Äôve solved so many problems for this team (not that that‚Äôs surprising he‚Äôs LeBron lol)."
"They don't care that he posts videos, they care that he isn't showing up and isn't being aggressive enough on offense  Nobody gives a fuck about videos, i've seen videos of Mitchell Robinson looking like KD that he posts, are you angry about that? Are Knicks fans angry about it? That he doesn't go in game and act like Kevin Durant   https://www.instagram.com/p/CF2IJ54pRTU/   This was last year,  SHIT ABOUT TO GET REAL with 3s   He went 0/0 in threes"
"For fucking real.  Uhhh yeah any gsw fan that wants to complain is getting a big ol ""boo hoo"" from me on this one. 5 straight finals, 2 mvps, 3 titles, signing Kevin Durant after greatest regular season of all time and now all of a sudden theres a curse cause the guy who got you a top 10 draft pick this year is refusing to get vaccinated? Even when the warriors have losing seasons they find ways to squeeze out moral victories. The only reason they have kumknga rn is cause they got dlo in a sign and trade when durant went to brooklyn  Fwiw Klays injuries are nothing short of a tragedy and no one deserves that kind of horrible luck and hes a good dude it seems, but like cmon man then the nuggets (murray), lakers (brons groin in 18-19 and ad's everything), nets (all of last season), clippers (kawhi), and celtics (hayward and kemba) are all cursed too. Fuck it the knicks are cursed then too cause mitchell robinson broke his foot last season and he couldve helped against capela in the playoffs  Edits for fixing typos"
"They really ranked Jarrett Allen above Nurkic, and Mitchell Robinson above Valanciunas."
"The form honestly looks very good. Hope he can apply this in real games.   On another realization, it's easy to make fun of sub-par shooters in the NBA but these guys are levels above compared to anybody else. Guys like Mitchell Robinson, Simmons, Adams, etc. are probably shooting upwards of 60% from three in practice."
"Obviously New York is not a small market, but I live in Tarrytown where the Knicks have their practice facility about 40 minutes outside the city. Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson came to get bbq at the place I worked not long after they were drafted. I gave them free biscuits! I credit mitch‚Äôs unexpecteded rise to those biscuits (let‚Äôs just not talk about Knox tho) Lol and I also saw Kyle oQuinn getting bagels once. Someone I have on Snapchat just posted a picture of nerlens noel out to brunch."
PG: Tyrese Maxey  SG: Landry Shamet  SF: Danny Green  PF: Draymond Green  C: Mitchell Robinson
"Mitchell Robinson could get $200M if he times his contract right and improves a little. That year the cap spiked was insane, average players were getting star-level money just because teams with cap space had nobody else to spend it on. Smart teams will consider overpaying the year before the cap spikes if they don‚Äôt have other good options to use up their space."
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
"PG: Ja,  Shai, Lonzo   SG: PG( all-star), RJ Barrett, Cade Cunningham  SF: Tatum(all-star), Mikal bridges, Jerami Grant  PF: KD(Superstar), MPG, Collins   C: AD(Superstar), Valanciunas, Mitchell Robinson"
"A big who can handle the ball like jokic and a 2 way guard like kawhi for all stars i would have two athletic guards like Jamal Murray and Mitchell. For the role players id have jae crowder, joe Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr, javale Mcgee, Duncan Robinson, and Caruso. The end of the bench could be Grayson Allen and Jah"
"&gt; PER looks like a great stat  It isn't.  It's good when comparing all-time greats to other all-time greats, but does nothing when comparing good to great players.   Mitchell Robinson has a 21.6 career PER. Damian Lillard has a 22.4 career PER. Damian Lillard is not 3% better than Mitchell Robinson."
"Tim Hardaway was an All Star and I loved watching Glenn Robinson at Purdue.  So what I‚Äôm saying, kids, is think about this in a couple decades when you‚Äôre watching Trae Young Jr. in a shootout against Donavan Mitchell III or whatever.   That‚Äôs when you‚Äôll *really* feel old."
As someone that's seen countless practice videos of Mitchell Robinson shooting threes... I'm frustrated too lol
Mitchell Robinson üòî
"Depends on the team imo, Mitchell Robinson is the starting 5 for the Knicks"
Do you mean similar boxscore numbers?   Mitchell Robinson doesn't play as many minutes and imo isn't as good of a defender
Mitchell Robinson 19-20 put up similar numbers to Roy hibbert in an all star season. Does Mitchell Robinson deserve to be an all star?
"Yup, have Ewing lock down the 5 and have Obi start at the 4  Could even have Ewing at the 4 and Mitchell Robinson at the 5 if we wanted to go big"
Don't you ever in ya life mention Mitchell Robinson in the same breath as Shaq.  You should have your basketball license revoked after that statement.smh
If Mitchell Robinson just got more minutes he'd win MVP!!!
"We‚Äôll also begin the season with guys like Harkless, Davis II, Mitchell, Thompson, and Len coming off the bench where last year it was Glenn Robinson / Metu / Whiteside."
That shit only matters when you're a superstar and when you're that big your salary is the least important thing because you're going to get a max regardless. That shit doesn't matter if you're a guy like Mitchell Robinson. Sure the team drafted you but that doesn't mean I owe you anything when I'm a free agent.
That‚Äôs cool lol. I served Mitchell Robinson and Kevin Knox the summer before their rookie year when I worked at a bbq place in town. I gave them free biscuits! Lol
Robert Williams &gt; Mitchell Robinson (or did the consensus shift this year?)
"One of Zubac, T.Bryant, Lopez, or heck even Wagner would've been good at C next to AD. I remember we were supposed to draft Mitchell Robinson but Magic wanted his Michigan boy Wagner"
"&gt; No clue how he played in NY  We were 10-40 on the day of the trade lol frankly it didn't matter.  Although Mitchell Robinson had some noticable and immediate improvements as soon as he got there, so there was that at least."
"He was an alright mentor to Mitchell Robinson, who is developing really well (just hope he can stay healthy)."
"I mean, I guess it‚Äôs just fun I guess. I do not understand why people think these workout videos for a lot of players are indicative of their play on court. NBA players are really, really, really good at the game. Ben Simmons could be a sharpshooter in practice and in open gyms and a walking brick on an NBA court. I remember I saw Mitchell Robinson posted himself in an open gym and he was draining step back 3s and such and you watch a Knicks game he isn‚Äôt doing anything close to that. The worst NBA shooter can post a workout of them casually swishing like 20 threes in a row or something."
"&gt; The Knicks didnt,  The Knicks definitely got better. Their roster last season was Payton - Barrett - Bullock - Randle - Mitchell Robinson  Payton was absolute ass cheeks and Kemba *should* be an upgrade (though his injury status is a big question mark), plus they added a decent 3-and-D guard in the draft who could play if Kemba is hurt (assuming Randle goes full point forward). Plus Evan Fournier &gt;&gt; Bullock, they desperately needed another player who can get his own shot.   And of course,  RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley, both of whom are 21, are promising young players who could take step ups in skill."
He helped mentor Mitchell Robinson and had 2 good dunks that‚Äôs it
It‚Äôs possible the team got some better offensive pieces and hopefully Mitchell Robinson stays healthy
KG would be a poor mans Mitchell Robinson in 2021
"See, I don't even think there's solid proof he wouldn't be Tristan Thompson today. Where's that video of Mitchell Robinson or Andre Drummond maybe playing against guys in pickup and he legitimately looks better than prime Lebron. You become SO much better against worse players and SO much worse against good players.   It's literally impossible to tell. I'm not saying that would be true, I'm just saying it's literally impossible to know because all of these NBA players can really fucking hoop and the only reason they look bad is because they're against other NBA players."
I saw a practice clip of Mitchell Robinson where he did all kinds of crazy streetball handles right in a defender's grill then swished a 20 foot jumper with an incredibly quick release. This is a guy who basically can't score in a game if there's anyone between him and the basket
Mitchell Robinson Dennis Smith Jr Knox and like 2 first round picks would of been the starting point.
not the best but Knicks had an on paper hopefully solid off season   hopefully Kemba a good fit and i guess Fournier is a nice addition  if mitchell robinson stay healthy could be a good year
If Mitchell Robinson is healthy and plays like his old self he‚Äôll break it first.
"Queta is a real good defender, I could see him playing that Nerlens Noel/Mitchell Robinson rim-runner role and being very effective. He/Holmes should give y'all some versatility at C."
"Yeah because nobody declines that type of money that early and he was already pissed with the way they‚Äôve been coached with rumors swirling that he wants to be traded to Miami. Zion is an acl tear waiting to happen. NY swapped out their loose end Payton and inconsistent Bullock with Kemba Walker a playoff flamethrower in Fournier on top of two well renowned 3 and D rookies, locked up Julius for less than what he could‚Äôve gotten and Mitchell Robinson added about 30 lbs of muscle. Pelicans added nothing don‚Äôt try and compare that garbage franchise to what NYK is building right now."
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There‚Äôs a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
"&gt; Also Herro was in the trade talks  Yeah, I'm sure he was.  We just thought it was ridiculous that some fans thought Herro should be considered untouchable for Harden.  I mean, ultimately, it's not that bad, every team overrates their young players.  I've seen fans call the likes of RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Gary Harris, future stars.  Plenty of people on my team's sub think Mitchell Robinson will be Rudy Gobert that is also a 3pt marksman.  Every fanbase is guilty of this."
"People like you are the worst of all. And I‚Äôm not saying you specifically, but I grow tired of disagreements where people say stuff like, ‚Äúoh you don‚Äôt think Mitchell Robinson is a great passer? I guess you just don‚Äôt watch the games.‚Äù Or, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt think Lu Dort has more gravity than Duncan Robinson? You must not understand basketball at all.‚Äù Just because we watch the same games doesn‚Äôt mean we necessarily come to be same conclusions, and just because someone disagrees with you doesn‚Äôt mean they are ill informed. The worst one by far is draymond green. I like Draymond just fine, but you can‚Äôt say anything negative about him without hearing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs more to basketball than points. You casuals need to watch the games.‚Äù"
"Mitchell Robinson does these same videos and when the season starts, all he does is dunk"
Mitchell Robinson off-season workout videos vibes
Mitchell Robinson &gt;
"It's not even a hard argument either.  **Offense**: Both are about even scorers, Valanciunas averaged 2ppg less but played about 4 mpg less. JV was a lot more efficient (61 v 48 eFG%) and shot 37% from 3, while Ja shot 30% on nearly 4 attempts a game. Ja is obviously the better facilitator. Per36 JV was averaging 22 &amp; 16! When JV was on the court Memphis was a top tier offensive team and posted a 126 ORTG. Ja was at 108.  **Defense:** Neither is an elite defender, JV gets exposed a bit more due to his position and lack of defending the switch. JV is an elite rebounder and great at boxing out though. Defenders shot on average 6% less at the rim when JV was defending, better than Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson, WCS and Mitchell Robinson.  **Advanced:** Almost every single advanced stat paints JV as a much more impactful player than Ja. JV has fringe all star level advanced stats, while Ja has role player advanced stats (WS, WS/48, VORP, BPM, PER, TS%, Net RTG, +/-).   I think Ja obviously has more potential and room to grow, while JV is probably around his peak, but I think JV at this stage in their careers was Memphis' more impactful player, while Ja was their vocal leader and star."
Mitchell Robinson
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."
"Knicks fan here, and it's funny to see our sub try to say that because Mitchell Robinson set the Fg percentage record 2 seasons ago that he's not a below average offensive player. His average shooting distance is around 1.7 feet."
I think you'd probably leave of Mitchell Robinson in favor of Duncan Robinson or Truck Robinson.
Robinson  Nate Robinson  Glenn Robinson   Cliff Robinson  David Robinson  Mitchell Robinson?  Sure there's more.
NBA players are so good that even Mitchell Robinson and Bam look like KD when they play ones
"You‚Äôre not smart and that‚Äôs okay. Marcus Morris already publicly stated that Rich told him to take the 3 year $41 million contract from the Clippers because the Spurs could only offer him the MLE. This is known in the NBA that Rich Paul hates Leon Rose &amp; Leon Rose hates Rich Paul, Rich TRIES to keep his clients away from the Knicks &amp; Leon Rose TRIES to keep Klutch clients off the Knicks (made Mitchell Robinson &amp; Nerlens Noel leave Klutch &amp; released Alonzo Trier because he wouldn‚Äôt leave Klutch). Morris agreed to the San Antonio deal, backed out of it so Rich had to relieve himself of Morris‚Äôs representation so his relationship with the Spurs would stay strong because he has 3 clients on the Spurs still."
"KAT‚Äôs definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there‚Äôs definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don‚Äôt know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who‚Äôs better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That‚Äôs 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I‚Äôd put above him but are debatable"
"Okay take your experiment to its max.  2021 Knicks, with no Randle, RJ, Mitchell Robinson and no tradeable first Rounders.  Your Starters are:  * PG: Payton * SG: Harden * SF: Bullock * PF: Toppin * C: Noel  Bench:  * PG: Quickley * SG: Burks * SF: Knox * PF: Gibson * C: Pelle  You have to either get to the playoffs w/ that roster and win 3 series, or trade pieces of it to improve with guys who want to play with Harden and you have no tradeable picks.  Look me in the eye and tell me thats a title contender."
"&gt;Who else are the Blazers getting as a centrepiece and it's something the other team is actually going to offer? You say the Harden trade is an outlier but teams are pretty much the same asset wise as they were when that trade went down.  Some potential trades I think could happen:  Pelicans could decide to speed up their rebuild and offer Ingram  Nuggets could offer either Murray or MPJ  Miami could offer something like Bam/Herro/Robinson for Dame and Nurkic  Minnesota could offer Anthony Edwards (this one‚Äôs unlikely imo)   Jazz could offer Mitchell. Great player but they could be tired of early exits and want to go for a homerun with a Dame/Gobert duo.   This is all on top of other players and picks obviously, I‚Äôm just listing the centrepieces. I left out teams like the Grizzlies/Kings/Thunder/Pistons where the timelines just don‚Äôt make sense to trade for Dame and have no supporting cast left. But off the top of my head I think they‚Äôd take all of those packages and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable that they be offered either.  &gt;Embiid absolutely has more value to us because he doesn't want to leave lol. The situations are nothing alike, if Embiid was saying the things Dame has been saying I'd probably think differently.  Well I kinda assumed you knew the only way Philly would trade Embiid is if he requested a trade. I didn‚Äôt think I had to specifically say that because it‚Äôs common knowledge. What I‚Äôm saying is that even in a scenario where Embiid requested a trade you still 100% wouldn‚Äôt be happy with the package you‚Äôre offering for Dame. You can‚Äôt tell me with a straight face you‚Äôd accept something like that, even if it came after a trade request."
DeAndre Jordan Mitchell Robinson Clint capela
"I would go  JaVale McGee, Mitchell Robinson , Rudy Gobert"
Daniel Gafford  Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert
Ayton leads Trae in WS. so does Mitchell Robinson for some reason. it's a weird stat.
Jarrett Allen or Mitchell Robinson?
"How do the Knicks go from 4th seed to out of the playoffs after fixing their main weaknesses + getting Mitchell Robinson back, and just losing Bullock"
"Man I think five would be pretty tough for the Knicks at this point because the team doesn't really have clear cut Stars and has a lot of depth at the moment.    if I wanted to protect Randle, Fournier, Barrett and Mitchell Robinson, who in my opinion or the obvious four, there would still be a lot of players I'd want to protect. If I could protect eight players the next three in line would be quickly Burks and Noel, and I would just assume that Rose and kemba Walker would refuse to report to the expansion team enough where they wouldn't get snagged."
Kyle Anderson would instantly be like the 5th tallest player in the WNBA. He‚Äôs the same height as Britney Griner. It would be the NBA equivalent of Mitchell Robinson with great guard skills. This is even putting aside the obvious strength differences. He would completely dominate the WNBA on both ends and I would be shocked if he didn‚Äôt become the GOAT
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"That's a really bad take... Paul has guys like Harrell, Cory Joseph, and Mitchell Robinson who make well below 58 million.   Yes, if he did not follow on his duty as a agent he is wrong. But the dude handles contracts well below what Noel was offered."
"RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, and Obi Toppin is a pretty nice start‚Ä¶if Grimes and McBride have nice rookie years, the Knicks are in this convo next summer.    For now, in addition to the other teams mentioned already, I‚Äôll toss in Memphis‚Ä¶Morant, JJJ, Bane, Melton, Tillman, plus some other dudes just outside the 25-year old cap (Brooks, Clarke, Winslow). Not the best at the moment, but lots of potential."
"That‚Äôs not necessarily what it means.   Mitchell Robinson played 61 games and 23 mpg in the 2019-2020 and the Knicks had the 23rd best defense in the league. Was he at best the 23rd best defender that year and now he‚Äôs better than everyone (or even all centers) on every team below you guys? Was Myles Turner at best the 11th best defender last year since that‚Äôs where his team ranked by the time he got injured? I doubt it.  There‚Äôs more context to things like what you‚Äôre saying - teammates, playing through injuries, coaching, roster fluctuation and I could go on. I could be like well you know Rob had a 3.1 dbpm while Robinson had a 1.1 dbpm and has never had a higher dbpm than Rob since both were rookies so obviously this one thing makes Rob a better defender. But that also lacks context and wouldn‚Äôt be fair to Mitchell Robinson if I acted like that one thing was the end all be all."
"Mitchell Robinson, although I think he will be a star in this league soon enough. Made serious strides last season on offense and defense. If he can stay healthy for a whole or most of the season he'll be right up there in DPOY conversation, also I think for what it's worth he's the best lob threat in the game. Not only is he 7 foot but he jumps like he's Dennis Smith Jr and his catch radius is insane, never seen an ability like his to block so many jumpshots on the perimeter"
"I don't think you gather just how much the ""he's so athletic"" argument doesn't matter. Mitchell Robinson Horizontally limited? Is that a joke? Have you watched Mitchell last season? Clearly not if you think he's horizontally limited, just a taste of his horizontally limited defense on display here.   https://twitter.com/23savage____/status/1429647586345070595?s=19"
"He's a *very* good finisher who basically only takes shots at the rim, which makes him extremely efficient but also inherently limited as a scorer. If he develops a legit jump shot, for example, he'd be a significantly better overall player even though it'd bring his efficiency down.  That said, his efficiency at the rim *is* pretty crazy‚Äî most of the guys who hit 70% are groundbound centers who operate exclusively from the dunker's spot (see: Mitchell Robinson). Rob shoots similar percentages while often taking *much* longer dunks‚Äî 35% of his shots started from outside the restricted area last year."
Mitchell Robinson is better than Robert Williams so why don‚Äôt we talk about him as potential top 5?  Christian Wood too.  Edit: Capela is also in that top 5 mix of C‚Äôs.
Mitchell Robinson has been making less than $2mil/year which is a steal compared to his productivity. He‚Äôll probably get a new contract worth $15mil/year which is more than fair IMO.
"That‚Äôs kind of an over simplification of this Knicks team.   Julius as the best player on this team, with no average PG play when DRose goes to the bench and Mitchell Robinson injured? Yeah, that team doesn‚Äôt go far at all.  But Julius as the best player, along with legit shooters, Kemba/DRose 1-2 punch, good perimeter defense, Mitchell Robinson clogging up the lanes, and possibly the deepest team in the NBA.   That team sure can go far."
Defensively he reminds me of young Mitchell Robinson
You mean Mitchell Robinson? Yeah the Knicks did it to a lesser degree. I do think it was a lot of minutes for them though given that he and THJ were late 1st/early 2nd round picks instead of lottery. And it's paid off with both of them IMO.
"Still, 1% of people on your regular commute in NYC recognizing you would be stressful. I can't imagine 1 out of 100 people stopping me to talk at my Union Square transfer.  That said, it's weird how sports celebs are treated different than other celebs in NY. I've seen Michael Cera at the laundromat but would never say a word except, ""that's my dryer"" cause he's in my way but if I saw Mitchell Robinson I might just have to ask for an autograph like the shithead I am."
he's actually making fun of mitchell robinson because he won't let him shoot smh
time lord and mitchell robinson couple of favorites!
People are sleeping on just how imposing Mitchell Robinson is. He's huge and freakishly athletic.
more like Mitchell Robinson was bothering him
Why do C‚Äôs fans feel the need to shoehorn Williams every single time Mitchell Robinson is brought up? It‚Äôs been happening constantly since they were drafted
Shaq has no idea who Mitchell Robinson is lol don‚Äôt take anything he says to heart he‚Äôs just there to entertain and BS with his buddies.
"Y‚Äôall gon be hearing about Mitchell Robinson for DPOY this year  (A lot of it is gonna be from me whether he deserves it or not, but still)"
Living in Rikers Island courtesy of Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell Robinson is a future multi-time DPOY winner once he gets the fouls under control
Extend Mitchell Robinson pls
He wants to come to NY to play with Mitchell Robinson instead of embiitch
Mitchell Robinson plays/moves like he just had a growth spurt and hasn‚Äôt gotten used to his longer limbs yet
Teams would have to bring multiple Shaqs just to foul Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell robinson would eat prime Shaq alive
Shaq is a bonafide hater. Calling Mitchell Robinson weak for no reason
"Mitchell ""Bill Russell"" Robinson yessir"
76ers are doing anything they can to get MITCHELL ROBINSON switched off embiid lol
"No no, you‚Äôre thinking of his brother Mitchell Robinson"
Mitchell Robinson if he stays healthy
Get DRose and Mitchell Robinson some help
It‚Äôs always bad with Doris Burke‚Äôs boring ass whisper commentary always focusing on one player and trying to drive a narrative. Knicks fans absolutely despise this lady now for all her random Knicks hate even though she‚Äôs apparently a fan. Every Knicks game she picks the opposing all-star(s) and will only talk about them. If Mitchell Robinson gets a block she will talk about how crafty the other player was to be in position to take a shot. This lady sucks at commentary in general
Does not count as a block  I‚Äôve seen Mitchell Robinson do this 1 million time already and If they counted he‚Äôd be averaging 5 blocks per game for his career

But reddit armchair GMs told me that Ayton is a glorified Mitchell Robinson and doesn't deserve a max
Oh without a doubt the Bucks inside game isn't even that great which is why the Nets performance is concerning.  They won't be able to handle guys like Thomas Bryant or Mitchell Robinson this year at all.  They will be feasting
Yea-- I could see some NBA defense awards or something as well in his future.  Him and Mitchell Robinson seem somewhat similar (I think Mitch is a little better on defense + rebounding but Timelord is a much better passer).
Knicks would probably offer Mitchell Robinson and a few assets from the stockpile.
"Block some shots, hit easy layups/dunks, get rebounds?   Mitchell Robinson."
I‚Äôd rather pay Robert Williams and Mitchell Robinson than pay Ayton 170 mill. It‚Äôs not worth it/
IQ + RJ plus picks. Maybe even Mitchell Robinson too. You can rebuild with that.
"Using the last 10 MVP winners to argue that WS/48 is a good metric is cherrypicking because a broader look at WS/48 results (or a look at its purpose and methodology) shows that it's a poor metric.  The fact that Jokic at .185 WS/48 at age 20 in his rookie season (16th in the league) just isn't all that interesting. Lots of mediocre centers have great WS/48, and Mitchell Robinson had a much better WS/48 in his age-20 rookie season.   And this isn't to hate on Jokic. The much better argument is that [Jokic finished top 15 in RPM](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c03oag/there_are_8_players_whove_made_5_allstar_games_in/er2g5v0/?context=999) (before ESPN ruined that metric) in each of his first four seasons."
Mitchell Robinson for DPOY üò§
Let me put this j down and think about this. As a Knicks fan I'll try not to be too biased.  ROY - Q. GRIMES MIP - RJ BARRETT or Obi Toppin 6th man - D ROSE or IQ Coach - THIBS DPY - MITCHELL ROBINSON  MVP - J RANDLE  We're winning everything.  Book it. Not financial advice üòÜ
"&gt; And for anyone who wants to cry about that metric 9 of the last 10 MVPs led the league in it.  Ironic to pull this out in a thread about cherrypicked stats.  WS is designed to measure impact in eras before we had play by play stats. It's fine for that, but there's absolutely no reason to use it to compare modern players to each other.  It's a box score stat, and MVP voters love box score stats.   It also horribly overrates big men. In 2021, 11 of the top 20 players in WS/48 were centers. That's not a fluke. It was 10 of 20 in 2020 and 11 of 20 in 2019.   Zubac, Mitchell Robinson, Harrell, Dwight Powell, Jarrett Allen, and Valanciunas are not actually top 10 players, yet WS/48 has had them in. the top 10 in the past 3 seasons."
I'd take Mitchell Robinson next
"My buddy and I were there. Knicks looked dead in the water all night and somehow pulled it out. Granted Beal, KCP, and Dinwidde hardly saw the floor during the second half, but we had to grind that shit out, and did so behind big 4th quarter minutes from our rookie Quentin Grimes. It was great to see Mitchell Robinson take the floor tonight too. I love this team."
"I also see Celtic fans saying he‚Äôs going to be better than Capela which just seems ridiculous to me, lots of big are super efficient early in their careers when they are only getting 20 mpg; Holmes, Mitchell Robinson, Gafford, etc."
Mitchell Robinson gained a lot of weight this summer too.
"Mitchell Robinson played 31 games last year, had a foot injury which are typically bad for big men. His career high is 9 points. He has potential no denying it, but he isn‚Äôt nothing but a role player atm, and coming off a a leg injury as well. And if you think 8 points and 8 rebounds in 31 games is more than a role player I would be surprised.  Evan Fournier is a number 2 option on a bad team, but when he got to Celtics I think that shows the exact player he is. A 3rd or 4th option. I can‚Äôt see Fournier being a first or second option on championship team, 3rd option at best. I don‚Äôt think he can carry your team. Obviously more than a a standard role player, but a Role player doesn‚Äôt have to be playing 16 spot minutes a night. Derek Fisher was a role player for the Lakers late 2000s despite being their starting point guard.   Derrick Rose had maybe his best year since his MVP season, but that also backs what I‚Äôm saying. He was their second best player. I‚Äôm not going to act like a 33 year old playing 25 minutes a night is good for the next 5 years. There‚Äôs probably one more season left of that good Rose from last season.  They aren‚Äôt your traditional role players (as in playing 15 mins a night) but we got some dude who averaged 14 on a good team once he was traded to the Celtics and went to a 3rd sometimes a 4th option, you got a young promising big man who hasn‚Äôt taken the next leap yet and a 33 year old (absolute legend) point guard who can only play off the bench. They aren‚Äôt stars either, and most likely wouldn‚Äôt be focal points on other teams."
"Lmao this is so incorrect I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.  The funniest part was when you called Evan Fournier, Mitchell Robinson, and Derrick Rose ‚Äúrole players‚Äù like they are Bobby Portis or Stanley Johnson."
"Lol you say his team is gonna be wrecked I drafted Kyrie, Simmons, Jon Isaac, and Mitchell Robinson in 1 draft"
Mitchell Robinson still on rookie deal?
"This isn't an impressive list.   You can't count Bridges. They didn't pick him. They picked him for Phoenix because they wanted Zaire Smith.   Landry Shamet is a fringe rotation player and the very next pick was Robert Williams. Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham and Mitchell Robinson all went within the next 10 picks.   Thybulle is fine for pick 20 but he's not a starter or anything.    Maxey has potential but hasn't really done anything yet. The same can be said for Joe."
"Yeah RJ is clearly underrated.   Dude wasn‚Äôt selected for 2nd team All-Rookie and was left off the top 100 with Kemba, Derrick Rose, and Mitchell Robinson all making it over him."
"It's Derrick Rose, but if it ends up being Mitchell Robinson or RJ the team will be in a great place."
"2018, GSW drafted Jacob Evans over Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, and Jalen Brunson.  You can do this with any team just about every year."
"DRose, Julius Randle and Nerlens Noel are all currently injured and Kemba Walker and Mitchell Robinson have played an average of 48 games the last two years.   Barrett and Quickly were very reliable last year, but Topin and Knox were not. I don‚Äôt trust the rookies or Fournier, but maybe you do."
"Whatever, agree to disagree. Thibs is playing pre-season like regular season, so if that's any indication, then Kemba &amp; Rose are gonna play 24 mins or less each until the playoffs. With that kind of playing time, they will be fine. We even have depth to let each of them rest each night of a back to back if needed.  To say our roster is a ""walking medical ward"" is just ridiculous. The only old guy on the roster is Taj, and Thibs knows exactly what Taj can give him. The 2 point guards I addressed above. The only legit concern I have is Mitchell Robinson, and that's not a Thibs thing. Mitch was dealing with injuries before Thibs was even here."
Mitchell Robinson is a lob threat on offense and a superior rebounder on defense. One aspect of that series that I find telling is the hawks rebounded much better than the Knicks. When you have a team of shooters that also rebound well it won‚Äôt bode well for any opponent.
"on what planet are they better than the knicks core? rj is better than wiseman in almost every way imaginable except height, poole is looking like he‚Äôs gonna have a breakout season, which means he‚Äôs been mediocre before, so how has he been better than mitchell robinson or quickley? obi toppin looks like he‚Äôs ready to break out, so feel free to put him in that mix.   kuminga and moody have played zero games yet, so can you really say that they‚Äôre better than kevin knox, who was a high draft pick and had a great first summer league before getting buried on the bench. so claiming that kuminga and moody have more growth potential than mcbride, quentin grimes, and jericho sims is unfounded."
"The knicks defense wasn't the reason why they got beat in 5. Having mitch in the paint wasn't going to help out Julius either.   If your only offensive option was old man game rose in 2021, you're not going to be competitive in a playoff series, and I dont think there is any world where Mitchell Robinson, who isn't a bad player by any means, is worth 2 playoff wins lol"
You have PTSD?? At least you had Embiid to defend him. Watching thin Nerlens and old ass Taj try to defend Capela while Mitchell Robinson was injured totally wrecked me
"Shai, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, Lebron, a healthy Mitchell Robinson"
"Not saying we would have won but had we had Mitchell Robinson for that series against Atlanta it would have been a lot more competitive. Hell even Nerlens was pretty banged up for it. Capela was killing us just as much, if not more so than Trae.   Add in the fact that Mitchell still isn't even cleared to play at this point has me pretty nervous."
Hypothetically if last year's Knicks team somehow acquired Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier and got Mitchell Robinson back from injury and drafted 3 NBA ready rookies and had everyone buy into the culture and had all of their young players improve again I feel like they could be the first seed in the East  Hypothetically of course
That makes no sense whatsoever lol what a list.  Mitchell Robinson with like 30 games in 3 seasons. Great player when healthy but totally undeserved imo
You don‚Äôt think Mitchell Robinson is as good as Ayton?
Mitchell Robinson when healthy has to be up there
Mitchell Robinson
"1) Eligible but not in the league- Isaiah Thomas  2) Short contracts(two-ways, ten-day contracts)- Karim Man√©  3) Non-rotation bench players- Justin Robinson  4) Rotational bench player- Brad Wanamaker   5) Elite bench player(6 MOTY candidates)- Jordan Clarkson  6) Basic starter- Harrison Barnes   7) Niche Starter- Myles Turner   8) Elite starter- Jerami Grant   9) Border line All-Star- CJ McCollum   10) All-Star- Donovan Mitchell   11) All-NBA- Luka Doncic   11) MVP Level- Kevin Durant"
Damn. Don't hate me guys.   But I like a healthy Mitchell Robinson more than Jarret Allen.

"Mitchell, Embiid, OG, Cade, Robinson  Embiid is already the second most lethal offensive weapon in the league. On this team he'll have incredible spacing to work with. This team will be utterly dominant on offense. Surrounding Embiid with shooters ensures he can't be doubled allowing him to score even more than he does already. If Cade lives up to the hype they might be one of the best offensive teams of all time.  On defense they're not as great. Robinson is a really weak enough defender and Embiid is slow. Cade and OG are great defenders and are only going to develop and Mitchell's about average. So while they're weaker on this end they're definitely not weak.  I'm certain that this team with its insane talent and youth would easily contend for 5 years."
"Cade, Mitchell, Robinson, OG, Embiid  Embiid as the MVP candidate and just someone who is a problem for every opposing team. Mitchell as the go-to perimeter scorer. Duncan Robinson can‚Äôt be ignored. OG as 3 and D with potential for more. Cade can easily provide value to a contender right away and has all-star plus potential to really put the team over the top."
"Imagine if Marcus smart had Donavan Mitchell‚Äôs scoring. Then pair him with two future superstars in Randle and rj and u got an unstoppable lineup. Then add certified buckets like Kemba Walker and drose Quickley and add in some defensive anchors like Mitchell Robinson nerlons Noel. That‚Äôs how u beat larden, DurSnake, and anti-vax Allen iverson"
Mitchell Robinson
mitchell robinson. small town outside of new orleans. real funny guy. i remember he would dab before taking a free throw lmao
Mitchell Robinson isn't worth the extension he is going to get. I fear he is to brittle.   I want to believe he works out for the Knicks.
"I said the same thing but tbh Mitchell Robinson looks really bulked without being cut. Like I‚Äôm pretty sure Nurkic is one of the heaviest centers in the NBA by playing weight (and isn‚Äôt super cut) and I think recent photos of Mitch kinda look comparable in definition to Nurk.  Maybe not 280 but he seems heavy, lol."
"&gt;this is the craziest one I've found  Yep, slightly frustrating thing for us fans, but it used to be the case that the teams would report one weight, basically from training camp rookie year or draft combine and then never update that number. That said, Robinson basically had  a smallish frame and skinny legs with a ton of muscle laid on over it. So he was always somewhat light. The Knicks Mitchell Robinson said this summer that he is 280. I'm sure Robinson never came close to that."
"If he‚Äôs considered a C, this is the obvious answer. Otherwise, maybe Mitchell Robinson?"
I‚Äôd say Mitchell Robinson if he was healthy
Best rebound/box out I have seen.   He was in acres of space and didn't move an inch.   Knicks will never be good with a lazy idiot like Mitchell Robinson.
Charge? Just go straight up. It‚Äôs fucking Mitchell Robinson against a washed James Johnson. Robinson has an absurd standing reach and vertical. Johnson would‚Äôve had to throw up a prayer.
Mitchell Robinson has the IQ of like -100. How can we make him smarter?
Damn Mitchell Robinson cost them the game at the end there
"Mitchell Robinson should stay in Brooklyn, don‚Äôt allow him entry to NYC"
Great game. Mitchell Robinson messed up on that final play though. :/
When did Mitchell Robinson get so jacked? Drug test that man
"They wouldn't have cap space for Randle if KD and Kyrie went to the Knicks.  The trade package would've probably been RJ, Knox, Ntilikina, Mitchell Robinson and a ton of future first round picks.  Randle would've probably been a Net haha, that off-season most realistic Nets fans thought the guys we were most likely gonna get were either Tobias Harris or Randle."

definitely not Mitchell Robinson
For the current Suns roster would you rather have Ayton on a max or sign and trade him for assets plus sign Mitchell Robinson at 40/4.
Mitchell Robinson
While completely ignoring the solid defense and giving NY the same production that Mitchell Robinson has. You may not know it but these types of performances are also important in winning games.
"The 2 blocks, 1 steal on only 1 PF. That‚Äôs impressive for someone who only played 22 minutes. The numbers he had tonight are nearly identical to what Mitchell Robinson averages. So when Mitch struggled tonight, Sims stepped up and covered that hole for NY.  Again, for him to come out and produce the same level as NY‚Äôs starting C in his very first game with significant minutes is very impressive."

"We will make a move for a C. I'm sure we will try to dump WCS for a 2nd swap or something just to make room for a C and send some picks for a C that fits our TPE. My favorite bets are Favors and Zubac, although Bryant and Dwight are also possibilities.   Doubt we trade KP, considering how he improved and how Kidd likes him, unless there's a home run proposal, like Simmons, which I doubt. But I wouldn't be surprised if we offer DFS and the 2025 1st for some long term help. Doubt Cubes will want to go deep in the tax with a 1st round exit core, and we are definitely signing Brunson to a new deal next year. DFS still has value as a good 3 shooter that can guard the best player of any team and we need a long term answer at the 5.  DFS and a 1st for Myles Turner or Mitchell Robinson would be my dream."
last week one of my opponents tried to offer me a trade of Kelly Olynyk + Mitchell Robinson + Cory Joseph in exchange for  LeBron + Jaylen Brown üòî. I obviously declined the offer and still lost (still winless in my fantasy league) but damn those injuries have my team disrespected
But then they would need to get rid of Turner too (to some other team). If sabonis and turner is bad. Then robinson+Mitchell is even worse
Not sure but if they're interested in Mitchell Robinson/Immanuel Quickley/picks for Sabonis just say the word

"Yeaaa, that's what popped out to me, like I have the same size feet as Mitchell Robinson lmao, that's crazy.  Another fun fact, Paul George wears size 12's at 6'8""!"
&gt; I was watching the Knicks last night and saw Mitchell Robinson block a shot off a dude and the Knicks gained the possession. Pretty dope but I don‚Äôt think that will show up in the stat book.  It's a block and a rebound.
"WS is designed to measure impact in eras before we had play by play stats. It's fine for that, but there's absolutely no reason to use it to compare modern players to each other.  It also horribly overrates big men. In 2021, 11 of the top 20 players in WS/48 were centers. That's not a fluke. It was 10 of 20 in 2020 and 11 of 20 in 2019.  Zubac, Mitchell Robinson, Harrell, Dwight Powell, Jarrett Allen, and Valanciunas are not actually top 10 players, yet WS/48 has had them in the top 10 in the past 3 seasons."
"I didn't think Taj Gibson was washed, however I did not think he'd be this impactful on the Knicks over the last three seasons. After 2019 I thought he'd just retire after playing for his hometown team. Got one last good contract, solid vet presence for a younger Mitchell Robinson. Then the lockout cut the season short and most figured that'd be it for Taj.  Unfortunately Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel are made of glass, so we brought him back in 2020. He was holding it down, taking on an awesome second center off the bench role after Nerlens took over as a starter...or starting himself whenever Nerlens would inevitably get injured. Taj was still playing so well despite an eye injury that he was dubbed ""Taj-1000"" after the Terminator for his domination in the paint and putback prowess.  This season, because Mitch and Nerlens continue to find ways to get injured, Taj is still getting worthwhile minutes and being an overall positive off the bench and sometimes even starting. I don't think most people expected Taj to be getting this much playtime this late in his career, but overall he's been a solid and most importantly **available** center in our rotation. Great way to potentially end a career playing for your hometown."
This reminds of a video of Mitchell Robinson playing pick up and shooting 3s like he was KD lmao
I remember being so mad at the Celtics for taking Rob over Mitchell Robinson‚Ä¶ not so much anymore
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Jalen Green  4. Josh Giddey  5. Franz Wagner  6. Chris Duarte  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Davion Mitchell  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Alperen Sengun  11. Cam Thomas  12. Jeremiah Robinson Earl  13. Jared Butler  14. Sharife Cooper
Kinda pathetic with Mitchell Robinson and Julius Randle on the team.
"The fact that we have four semi-star ballhogs and mitchell robinson who flub the fucking game every time and have to be saved by Derrick Rose and his merry men is fucking annoying.  Ofc Drose gets hurt and we lost all momentum, randle comes in and I don't even want to talk about what happened."
Mitchell Robinson is an enormous human being.
"Well the question is how valuable Rodman would be as a help defender, as he was mainly post menace and on ball defender even pistons in his physical prime didnt let him defend Jordan as he was slow at the times on him and Joe Dumars was main guy, while Rodman being only bully to tire him out. Also idk if he would get as many rebounds as he did due to different no O rebound META, as far as rim runners goes idk only Mitchell Robinson and Robert Williams that are similar in height but I would probably not call them even top 15 centers in the league and they get smoked a lot every time they go against scorers."
"Mitchell Robinson, Anfernee Simons, Nas Little have to be up there"
"Mitchell Robinson, both are really athletic, tall and are excelent defenders"
"It was literally called a foul. So yes, it was a foul.   I don't believe the Morris incident was a basketball play, but I was talking about previous 'incidents'.  And you really need to watch the videos before you say anything.  [Markieff hits OG in the back, no defense played.](https://youtu.be/KZ-azSxV-oE)  [Markieff goes to the Raptors bench and instigates a brawl.  ](https://youtu.be/QUpnYgNZ0T8)  [Markieff going after Boogie after the whistle. ](https://youtu.be/_l2_1vtXMeU)  [Markieff going after Hield completely unprovoked.](https://youtu.be/z9WUBR3e7H8)  [Markieff going after Mitchell Robinson after the whistle and gets ejected. ](https://youtu.be/-bY7QYTZ4GA)  So you're still full of shit. You have nothing. No argument, nothing. Bye."
"Close to $100K.  But I remember when Mitchell Robinson did this for blocks MSG added half the amount of his donation, so maybe more."
"Over Obi Toppin and Taj Gibson, mind you.  Mitchell Robinson was out, Taj Gibson playing hurt.  Impressive nonetheless"
We celebrate every win cuz they all count the same. This one counts the same as the 1st one where Mitchell Robinson almost made Embiid cry at the end of the bench and all you whiny tools were on here calling for Rivers to fired after the game Lmaooooo.   Enjoy that home L boy. Knicks in 4.
"maybe the knicks will trade you mitchell robinson, we got a lot of center depth right now  his value is kind of weird though I'm not sure what he is worth"
Mitchell Robinson 5 blocks in 16 minutes...
"Ima gonna start rooting against Embiid. Originally, when Mitchell Robinson on the Knicks was bitching him around the fourth, I felt kinda bad for Embiid, but not no more."
"Jokic averages 27/12/7 while shooting 70% on you, this is like Mitchell Robinson all over again"
"Mitchell Robinson needs significant development to his offensive game. When the Knicks 3 pointers aren't falling, they need to attack the paint. But Mitch can't pull his defender out since he isn't a threat anywhere he can't dunk the ball. So the paint gets clogged. Really bad spacing with him on the floor when the other team can just sit on him."
"There are people here who still don't think he can shoot. And he's been making 16 footers since his rookie season. The real answer is yes he has been under the radar, I don't think he takes it to Mitchell Robinson the way he did against the Knicks two nights ago last year. He is a good player with swings in his performance which pretty much sums up his entire career."
Or Mitchell Robinson
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
"I mean Cam Payne (before his rookie contract was up) was traded for Taj Gibson, Doug mcbuckets and a 2nd round pick (I believe it became Mitchell Robinson). OKC then traded Kanter, Mcbuckets, and the 2nd pick for Carmelo Anthony. They then traded Anthony and a top 14 2022 protected pick for Dennis Schroeder. Dennis then got shipped to the Lakers for Danny Green, a first that became Jaden McDaniels I believe. OKC then packaged that pick to Minasota for pick 16 of the 2020 NBA draft to pick none other than Aleksej Pokusevski. So in the end I think the Thunder got their guy!  Also, at least Cameron Payne figured it out and is a role player in the NBA.  A D.  On your report carddoesn't bring your GPA down to a 1.0 if you have all A's."
"PWill was going up for a dunk, got fouled really hard, landed on his wrist, damaged his wrist muscles. Will undergo surgery. Foul was ruled a flagrant.  From: https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/what-happens-next-following-patrick-williams-injury  &gt;Those are just some of the possibilities, speculation and angst now that Bulls starting power forward Patrick Williams likely will miss the rest of the regular season with torn ligaments in his left wrist. Williams sustained the injury on a dunk attempt when Mitchell Robinson slid over from the left side to block the driving attempt just as Williams made a pair of baskets. No one suggested it was intentional, though Robinson was assessed a flagrant foul.  &gt;The Bulls Friday released this statement: ""Chicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams will undergo surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left wrist from an injury sustained in last night's game vs. the New York Knicks. Williams is expected to miss approximately 4-6 months."""
"you're joking..of course Mitch gets traded for prime Kareem. If you posted right now in the Knicks subreddit ""hey for some reason Denver wants to trade Jokic for Mitchell Robinson"" no shit every single person is going to say yes  a Tyler Herro for Lowry trade is one that Toronto wins, same goes when trading RJ Barrett for prime Jordan or Zach Lavine"
"I‚Äôm joking btw, he‚Äôs a young dude with a lot of upside but many times he just gets caught doing too much. For example, there‚Äôs numerous times he‚Äôd try to iso on a big then travel or jack up an airball.   He‚Äôs also put in a tough position being undersized trying to guard guys like Mitchell Robinson and Vucevic. Just need more reps especially finishing around the rim, and more confidence too."
"Yes, that's why you can't compare efficiency between a high volume shooter and a guy like Mitchell Robinson"

"Mitchell Robinson was a great second round pick for the Knicks.  I wish the Pistons had a couple tall centers on their roster of his height,  weight and talent."
"I am sure you can get Mitchell Robinson and a player like Fournier from the Knicks for Towns and a pick or two, what do you think Knicks fans?"
I kind of feel like Robinson bailed Mitchell out of being blocked there.
I wonder who‚Äôs the next Knicks player to join mavs. Mitchell Robinson would be quite nice
"lmao thanks for the trip down memory lane, funnily enough the Knicks have been one of my favorite teams to watch since Thibs started coaching and Julius ascended to All-NBA status. I also got Mitchell Robinson on my dynasty fantasy roster lol  And to be fair, the Sonics who have been gone for over a decade have ***still*** won more playoff series than the Knicks in the last 20 years lol"
"The two players drafted ahead of him were insanely flashy and marketable. RJ isn‚Äôt, but his work ethic and natural ability make him a franchise cornerstone. He‚Äôll be more appreciated in due time, and I think if he hit more game winners in big games this year, it‚Äôll catch a lot more national attention.   Also if RJ and Mitchell Robinson stay healthy, they‚Äôre both making the all defense team and one of them is winning DPOTY, calling it now."
Ducan Robinson  David Robinson  Mitchell Robinson  Nate Robinson  what older dudes am i forgetting?
Even Mitchell Robinson skipped college to train himself
"We should ban dunking, that way people won't get hurt because there's like 10x more contact on posters than what Mitchell Robinson did last night."
"Green has shown sparks but I wouldn't put him with the other two yet. He was always going to put up numbers on a roster that depleted.   What Barnes is doing on a team that always has wings and what Mobley are doing are *suuuper* impressive. I can't recall a young big coming in and defending as well as Mobley.  Like often they'll have a strong defensive impact but they'll just be foul machines who can't play more than 20 minutes (Beef Stew, Mitchell Robinson). Mobley already looks like he gets it. It's like AD, Dwight, Garnett and Oden. And just as a rookie, Mobley's defense might be better than their rookie defense. I already feel a little sick about it. D:"
"He went up strong for a dunk and Mitchell Robinson decided it was clobberin time. He fell pretty hard to he floor. Got up and shot free throws, though. When I saw it in real-time, I never would have predicted that would be a season ending injury."
Yeah the one against Mitchell Robinson.
"Williams was about to throw down a big dunk and Mitchell Robinson was totally burnt and out of position. He hit Williams with a flagrant foul - hit him in the face and also hooked his arm which pulled Pat down to the ground. Landed right on his left wrist. Really reckless and dangerous shit from Robinson. He never even had a chance to make a play on the ball either. When you're totally beat, you're totally beat, and you gotta let it go. Doing what he did is just dangerous and now it cost Williams his entire season."
courtesy of Knicks resident dipshit oaf Mitchell Robinson everybody!
That guy deleted his comment But i was going to point out it was a freak accident. Mitchell Robinson and the Knicks in general were playing hard physical defense and didn‚Äôt allow the free dunk. It was also ruled as a flagrant so it wasn‚Äôt ignored.    Either way...shit like this sucks but we all know that injuries happen in this sport and effect both the regular season and the playoffs. Shit definitely sucks though...hopefully the Bulls recover from this. Injuries definitely happen to every team though.  Kyle got flipped on his elbow against the Nets and Bam ran into someones knee as well. Jokic also got injured the other night. This shit sucks..
"Nah, it wasn't a freak accident. Mitchell Robinson literally defended like an idiot and essentially threw him to the floor."
anything's possible when Mitchell Robinson can clothesline you with no consequence
"Yes, I‚Äôm sure Mitchell Robinson hit Williams in the face on purpose while thinking ‚Äúthis will totally lead to a season-ending left wrist dislocation‚Äù"
Shout out to Mitchell Robinson
and Mitchell Robinson
Mitchell Robinson injury prone asf
"Mitchell Robinson, who slapped Pat on the air that caused this also got injured now. Karma is a bitch"
People really don't understand how different the series against Atlanta is with Mitchell Robinson. The dude completely shuts down the paint
Mitchell Robinson for DPOY
Mitchell Mentally undefeated Robinson
"You're right.  Mitchell Robinson is the Wilt Chamberlain of our time because, even though he's nothing like Wilt in most ways and isn't the same tier of player, he set the new record for FG% in a season, and that's the only context that matters here."
They're no Mitchell Robinson and the Knicks   Ez gg
Allen Robinson chose Mitchell Trubisky over Aaron Rodgers. I have zero empathy.
"Allen Robinson deserves better  Dude went from Blake Bortles to Mitchell Trubisky, to Nick Foles to Mitchell Trubisky"
"Knicks are the second best defence in the league, up from 18th last season, and that's with largely the same roster. Thibs really is a fantasic defensive  coach.   As for individual players, Mitchell Robinson has been fantastic recently on the defensive end. He's learnt to stay on his feet and contest instead of jumping for every block, so his blocks are down but his fouls are also down, which is huge."
they put JRich and KCP above John Wall and DeRozan?  also the only Knick on the list is Mitchell Robinson... i love Mitch but he is NOT better than Randle or RJ
So stupid to not have had Mitchell Robinson in this whole quarter
"Ya they should also go for Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Mitchell Robinson and Christian Wood."
"Randle and Bullock start at PF and SF. Spellman sucks, Brazdeikis isnt NBA level, Noel is injured, Topping is injured.  We have Mitchell Robinson and then no Center or even power forward behind him to protect the paint once he's on the bench. Taj fills that gap"
"For Taj‚Äôs backup, Mitchell Robinson"
Mitchell Robinson also has 15 BTW
"I think AD‚Äôs a better ballhandler than Giannis but that‚Äôs not the point.  These terms are usually only used to compare players to other similarly impactful players.  Of course Giannis is more skilled than Mitchell Robinson.  But Giannis is probably less skilled than any of the top 5-10 ish players in the league, because he‚Äôs the worst shooter out of all of them, doesn‚Äôt possess any real post skill to speak of, doesn‚Äôt have particularly impressive touch, and is a good passer but isn‚Äôt a great one and isn‚Äôt a better passer than anyone else on that list except Davis, and even that isn‚Äôt by a huge margin."
"Maybe below average, but still better than guys like D-Rose, Dame, Duncan Robinson, CP3, the Ball brothers, Anthony Edwards, Westbrook, Fultz, LeVert, Bagley, Barrett, D-Mitchell, Hield, and Oubre.  I think his efficiency will continue to rise. Some of this is due to a new system, which the team is settling into now. Plus, he does have consistent help in LaVine and things will only get better once Markkanen returns."
"Randle is playing so many minutes because Obi has been out since game 1, Spellman's been out basically all year and Noel's been out the last few games as well. When Mitchell Robinson isn't in the game, Randle is our only healthy big. Once two of those 3 guys come back, Randle's minutes will go down at least a little."
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
The reason they‚Äôre playing so much minutes is because half the team is injured. Mitchell Robinson played 40 minutes because Nerlens Noel and Obi Toppin are injured. Same goes for Randle and RJ
Mitchell Robinson played 41 minutes tonight.   Good luck with that
"He is doing the beyblade move still but now instead of throwing up a bad shot, he is passing out to the wings for corner threes. Mitchell Robinson is boxing out a lot more allowing for rebounds. A lot more off ball movement by the whole team allowing for more space. Basically, a coach in Thibs that has a system and gets the players to buy in along with a coaches son that is holding players accountable in Austin Rivers."
"Wouldn't say he ""pioneered"" it since there was Mitchell Robinson who sat out a year for training and people who went to the NBL for a year instead of college.   But he's probably the first one who ""signed"" with a shoe brand to prepare for the draft, the official term they used is ""interned"" but NB basically signed him a year before the draft."
"Thibs is a really fucking good head coach that plays to his players strengths  Almost everybody on the team is having one of their best seasons ever, Austin Rivers is a fucking monster, Alec Burks was averaging 20 ppg before he got hurt, Elfrid Payton looks like an above average starting caliber point guard, even Mitchell Robinson has cut down on the fouls"
Mitchell Robinson just played 40+ minutes and only picked up 2 fouls - one was on the opening possession. That's how he becomes a stud.
"Not to mention I'm pretty sure the Hayes pick was at least partially informed by Ryan West as he's with the Pistons now, and he's as close to not ""missing"" as anyone in the past 5 years. He had hit after hit with the Lakers, so if he liked this pick then there is probably something there. But of course we don't know intimate details, it could be that he liked someone else and got overriden. Allegedly with the Lakers he wanted Mitchell Robinson, but Magic Johnson vetoed him and went with Mo Wagner."
"1) RJ Barrett  2) Julius Randle  3) Mitchell Robinson  4) Immanuel Quickley  5) Austin Rivers  6) Obi Toppin  7) Alec Burks/Kevin Knox (can‚Äôt decide)  Elfrid Payton is all yours, Seattle"
"Is RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson and a 1st enough? Possibly."
"Mitchell Robinson is about to get an extension, and I don't think he put it all together yet but maybe he will this season. All their young players can be in a rotation with role on winning team, but none of them has shown you build around them you will be a winning team."
"People always focus on what he can‚Äôt do, but he does have the record for all time true shooting percentage as a starter (Mitchell Robinson is a bit higher but that‚Äôs almost all off the bench). Add that to his excellent offensive rebounding and screens and he‚Äôs definitely a positive. He doesn‚Äôt raise a teams offensive floor hardly at all, but his efficiency raises the ceiling of an offense.  Whatever his struggles tonight he‚Äôs the best there is at the McGee/Capela role that was played on the Warriors and CP3 Rockets."
Mitchell Robinson about to pull a Jarrett Allen tommorow

"Knicks usually have good Centers.  Willis Reed, Jerry Lucas, Walt Belamy, Bob McAdoo, Bill Cartwright, Patrick Ewing, Marcus Camby, Tyson Chandler, Mitchell Robinson"
"The team will only improve, especially if Mitchell Robinson can get more aggressive without committing dumb fouls."
This is exactly what I was going to put but with Mitchell Robinson as dpoy
Unless you have Mitchell Robinson :(
"Mitchell Robinson, Divincenzo, and Devonte' Graham can probably be added with a chance of Gary Trent and Wendell Carter as well."
"Dawg Mitchell Robinson is in the clip guarding Collins. If Trae kept going forward, it would not have been too difficult for a big like Robinson to try and contest Trae's shot.  Its not like Trae is launching himself backwards, dude is trying to create space between him and the big which is when Austin runs into him drawing the foul. If Austin doesn't run into him, the shot falls  I called it a fade-away even though its not technically a fade-away because I don't see how its a fundamentally different concept"
"Mitchell Robinson is a big dude with long arms that can also jump. Trae needs to stop and do what he can to ensure that he doesn't get blocked by the big that has twice his size and athleticism.... but if you don't fade to avoid getting your shot blocked by the player in front of you, please enlighten me because I am dum-dum Hox fan"
Julius Randle- MVP  Mitchell Robinson- DPOY  RJ Barrett- MIP  IQ- ROTY  Alec Burks- 6 Man of the year  Austin Rivers- A bucket
Immanuel Quickley  RJ Barrett   Alec Burks  Julius Randle  Mitchell Robinson  although this squad might win a ring...
"Not saying this was you, but with the LA fanbase there's a misconception with how the Moe Wagner pick went down.   The scouting team wanted another player but Kuz played one on one with Wagner and Wagner was talking shit. And he told Magic to pick Wagner, and Magic overruled the scouting department and picked Wagner.  We knew that story for a while and we knew that they wanted a big. So it was reasonable to assume that the player was Mitchell Robinson. But we didn't know for sure for a long time. During the run up to the AD trade, it was definitely confirmed to not be Robinson. It was actually Omari Spellman. But don't think this information was spread with the fanbase so Magic overruling Mitchell Robinson keeps coming up."
That‚Äôs light work for Mitchell Robinson
He has more than twice as many assists as Mitchell Robinson had all of last year
Still mad they didn‚Äôt take Mitchell Robinson at 25 in 2018. Moe Wagner instead wasn‚Äôt great.
"&gt;That's not really insane on its own, elite forwards that focus mostly on drives shoot around 70% on 2s over a season.   Surely you're conflating percentage at the rim with all 2s, right?  LeBron James (earlier in his career) and Giannis Antetokounmpo, basically the dictionary definition of ""elite forwards that focus mostly on drives"" have never topped 62% or 64% on 2 pointers respectively.  70% is on par with centers who don't shoot outside of 3 feet, like Mitchell Robinson.    Regardless, you're totally right that it is the mid-range scoring that makes this so special.  This is an absolutely absurd scoring streak that he's on.  He's drilling contested fadeaway jumpers from the free throw line on out, he's lighting it up from three, he's putting guys like Jerami Grant in a spin cycle, it looks like he's in an empty gym out there.  He's going to be gunning hard for an All Star spot this year."
Mitchell and mitchell Robinson for sure
Replace Mitchell with a league average player and replace Rudy with a league average player. You better with Rudy and like Norm Powell or Mitchell and like Mitchel Robinson?
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
"Little known fact, [Mitchell Robinson used to star in Japanese commercials.](https://youtu.be/6-1Ue0FFrHY)"
Randle is currently playing very solid defense next to Mitchell robinson and nerlens noel. Pair him next to zubac in starting line ups and your front court can switch and protect the rim. Lonzo is known as a great defender. It looks to me like the only thing that would have been needed is to find a legit three and d wing to fill out the starting five.
"Yes, the only one where I feel like we missed was Mitchell Robinson, nothing wrong with Wagner but Robinson was available, a lot of fans wanted him too"
They call Mitchell Robinson the blockness monster lol.
"Little known fun fact about Mitchell Robinson. The equator isn't actually an imaginary line, it's just Robinson's wingspan reaching around the globe."
The Mitchell Robinson game.
"Also SGA and JJJ looking like studs, could be potential future all stars. When you‚Äôre the 2nd pick and two future MVP candidates and two more future all stars are drafted after you...   Also Mikal Bridges is looking really good. I‚Äôll ignore Mitchell Robinson because everyone whiffed on him the first time, but there look to be a half dozen MVP level to really good starter quality players drafted after him. Little early to tell with Michael Porter Jr. but his ceiling is higher, and Donte Divencinzo is good too."
Myles Turner is just boneless Mitchell Robinson.
"Dennis Rodman brought 5 rings to the offense, what has Rudy Gobert done so far?  Dennis Rodman was so great he allowed his teammate to concentrate on offense and win the leagues MVP in a yr where Hakkem, Shaq, Pippen, Clyde, Ewing had big years. That player was David Robinson, Gobert needs to become a scoring threat, he deffo is not a scoring threat at all. If he was, when they double Mitchell why do they leave Gobert on an island?"
Mitchell Robinson and Anthony Davis. Big man D
You wanna see bad screensetting? Watch Mitchell Robinson. Dude gets no contact on his screens every time and always prefers to slip before the ball handler can even think about utilizing the screen lol.
Mitchell Robinson
"For some reason, the advanced stats, all of (WS, BPM, and VORP) really love Mitchell Robinson. I'd stick to my guns and say Ayton though."
Julius Randle  Elfrid Payton   Kevin Knox  Mitchell Robinson  Frank Ntilikina  5 through 1
&gt;Mitchell Robinson isn‚Äôt a bench player  He would be in Miami.   And a 21 years old or not IQ‚Äôs ceiling is 6th man.   If golden state offers the minny pick or wiseman I‚Äôd take that over those 2 in an instant.
"It is an overpay, because there's more of him. This has become a pattern with rim runners these days. You can find them pretty easily. The 2 coming up pretty quickly are Nerlens Noel and Mitchell Robinson. But there will be others too."
"2 first round picks, immanuel quickley and mitchell robinson"
First thing I thought when I saw this post was Fuck I hope this doesn't inflate the price for Nerlens Noel and Mitchell Robinson.
I really hope not. This will fuck up our Mitchell Robinson negotiations
"Rim-running, shot-blocking centers are undervalued right now. Using the Knicks as an example: Nerlens Noel is on a 1 yr/$5m deal. They're also not in a rush to lock up Mitchell Robinson. If the Cavs don't at least explore the market to see if they can replace a large enough percentage of Allen's production with a player on a much smaller salary, I'd be surprised."
He didn't bypass any rule. He was a year removed from high school which is when you can legally enter your name in the draft. There's tons of unconventional paths. RJ Hampton played pro a year after high school and entered the draft. Anfernee Simons went to IMG academy as a post-grad route to the league. Bazley and Mitchell Robinson straight up skipped going to any team after high school and trained for the draft. Even before those guys Mudiay and Jennings played pro one year after HS before entering the draft.
"I like Jarrett Allen a lot so I am glad he's getting paid. It will be interesting to see where the market is for big men like this. As a Knicks fan, similar decisions will be need be made with Mitchell Robinson in the near future."
"I'll be honest, he isn't _sniffing_ all-defense.  He's quick and he's long, so he gets blocks and steals, especially as a help defender, but ultimately he just isn't strong or physical enough. He can't really bother physical centers, he's a liability on the boards (Knicks' DRB% worse by 4 points with him on), and it all adds up to a pretty pedestrian impact (Knicks' defense 4.5 points/100 worse with him on).  I don't think he's even better than Mitchell Robinson, let alone Gobert, Embiid, Capela, Turner, Poeltl, all of whom have put together really nice defensive seasons."
"Homer here but here me out.   Look at pitchers in MLB, some are being load managed to death and still breaking.   Old pitchers would throw many more innings and be fine.   Mpg != Injured, but data is data. I think it's more nuanced with body type, practice regimine, etc.   Look at Randle. Horse. Healthy. Lots of minutes.   Look at Mitchell Robinson. Twig. Played like 25 games?  Broken. Little minutes.   Hopeful that the Knicks are hiring some smarties, and we build in smart roster time management in the future."
"&gt;Mitchell was the leading scorer on basically a 50 win team as a rookie. That's unprecedented  First, it was only 48 wins, and second it's not unprecedented, David Robinson did that his rookie year, Wilt basically did, Kareem did. Good company, but not unprecedented."
"Mitchell was the first rookie to lead a 45-plus-win team (48-34) in scoring since the San Antonio Spurs‚Äô David Robinson in 1989-90.      His ability to put points on the board as the number one option, drawing major defensive attention every night was extremely impressive for a rookie. Especially when most rookies who score a lot do so without contributing to winning."
Thanks for this! One note regarding the Knicks is that Nerlens Noel (41 GS) was the starter for most of the games this year over Mitchell Robinson (29 GS) due to injury.
You really using field goal percentage for a guy like gobert who primarily gets his points from pick and rolls and dunks. This is like saying Mitchell Robinson is better than bam because of FG%
More versatile scorer. Mitchell Robinson can score 10 on 75% TS but he can only dunk
Can I interest you in one Tremont Waters? I think Mitchell Robinson and a first would be a fair return
"Mitchell Robinson deserves a shout out as well, was playing awesome before the injury happened"
"We have been drafting stud after stud in the late first and early second in the last few years. Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, even Damyean Dotson was a solid pick."
"I mean I haven't watched the Heat much this year, but I did consider them to be a very physical team last year. Crowder's gone but Bam, Butler, Ariza, Iggy, they still got guys that can be physical. It's not really about their playstyle, who on the Knicks can be that guy? Randle? RJ? Burks? Rose? I just don't think these guys can guard the Bucks efficiently. It looks like a better match-up to me.  Mitchell Robinson could be good for their interior D, not even sure when / if he's coming back."
"check that bag he got, that one time?  Check the under the table deal that we got scolded on because we're not LA or Boston -- completely gutting our future and tradable assets  Check getting his friends because he had a voice in the decisions we made in Troy Hudson, Sam Mitchell, Hollywood Robinson, Malik Sealy (who died), etc.  See us obtaining No. 1 overall picks Joe Smith (again), Michael Olowakandi.  Mike James after his ridiculous year in Toronto I think?, Ricky Davis (as an attempt to create a Sprewell Clone)  OFC, Terrell Brandon, Sam Cassell etc.  No ONE player came to Minnesota in Free Agency, literally everything was through trades, mostly terrible deals.  We weren't doing ourselves any favors, trading Billups/Szcerbiak/ a disgruntled Gugliotta , Feed my family Sprewell, Marko Jaric for Sam I Am + First.    We really tried, despite our incompetence."
following basketball and playing basketball are completely different. You might know who Hakeem is but I bet Mitchell Robinson could read a defense much better
Hard disagree. You ever seen nba players shooting in warmups? Mitchell Robinson shot 3s in highschool and doesn't take shots outside of 3 feet in the nba. Most guys could do this in a couple hours. I think only the absolute worst shooters in the league would struggle with this.
"Assuming we're only including players form the last 5 years (So no Curry, Klay, Draymond):  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (2016)  SG: Jordan Poole (2019) (Might be KPJ)  SF: Terance Mann (2019)  PF: Isaiah Stewart (2020)  C: Mitchell Robinson (2018)"
"SGA  Donovan Mitchell  RJ Barrett  Porzing*s  Mitchell Robinson  But obviously if we drafted SGA and/or Mitchell we wouldn't have been bad enough to draft Barrett, so this would have never happened"
"It‚Äôs a really, really good class. Ayton, Luka, Trae, Jaren Jackson, MPJ, Mitchell Robinson, Lonnie Walker, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson are all at the very least quality rotational players, at most superstars. That‚Äôs just off the top of my head, there‚Äôs probably more."
"Mitchell Robinson is our best defensive player on our team who was top 3 in defensive rating. He‚Äôs also probably the best lob threat in the league and considering that Clint Capela was able to sit in the paint all series against the Knicks, there‚Äôs also an argument about the massive impact he would‚Äôve had if Clint had to worry about the lob and not just play up high without any regard. You‚Äôre also just assuming the Knicks are going to look completely the same next season and you‚Äôre also completely disregarding the fact that this is a young team and that young playershappen to take leaps from time to time"
"You forgot about Mitchell Robinson, and Burks and Rose missed a lot of games"
"Never said they were contenders- just that by watching them you could see that their lack of talent was made up for with great coaching and unselfish team basketball.  Also, the Celtics were absolutely healthy. Before Jaelyn Brown got injured they were still worse than the Knicks all season- because the Knicks played better as a team and were the better team despite not having Tatum or Brown  Btw Knicks were missing their starting center nearly all season long which deserves to be mentioned- imagine how much better they would‚Äôve been playing Mitchell Robinson instead of Taj Gibson lol"
"I'd argue Embiid is able to be in that Bam, AD, Dray, Robinson group.  Listing where these guys are now is not indicative of their value come on. Context matters here, particularly in a season where so many had injuries due to the compressed off-season and season.  As far as being set up, sure, Conley and Mitchell being hurt would hurt any team.  However,  we all know Gobert isn't an offensive guy which is why he can't punish teams for going small on that end. It is what it is."
"We got mitchell robinson, same dif"
Mitchell Robinson is ridiculous
"Mitchell Robinson is American, but he got hurt this year I thought. Brook Lopez was on the World Cup team in 2019 so I could see that"
Mitchell Robinson is American right?  The Lopez bros could be solid options as well
Mitchell Robinson.
mitchell robinson
"Bam, Ayton, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Dwight, Drummond."
"What assets? The best player out of that deal was the second round pick that nobody cared about, and even then it became Mitchell Robinson, which eh. Kanter was a salary swap and McDermott wasn't on anybody's radar."
"By that logic Boston trading Rob Williams, Aaron Nesmith,  and Smart and picks seems like it would be competitive which I don't honestly believe. Smart is better than anyone in your package, Rob Williams serves the same role as Mitchell Robinson and Aaron Nesmith showed promise and is younger than Obi.  If you think that Boston's package wouldn't be enough (which I would agree with) you should recognize that the Knicks package is at best on par with it."
" Ok here‚Äôs your homework you moron, so he‚Äôs in the 50-55 range of best players.   Embiid, Simmons, Beal, harden, Kyrie, KD, Jrue, Giannis, Middleton, Randle, Trae, Bogi, Collins, Tatum, Brown, Butler, Bam, Duncan Robinson, LeVine, Brogdon, Sabonis, LaMelo, Hayward, Rozier, FVV, Siakam, Jerami Grant, Mitchell, Conley, CP3, Ayton, Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Kawhi, PG, Luka, Dame, CJ, Nurk, RoCo, AD, Lebron, Ja, JJJ, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Derozan, Zion, BI, Lonzo, Fox, KAT,  SGA, Christian Wood."
knicks win title if mitchell robinson isn't hurt
Theo Pinson was obviously the key to the Knicks finishing fourth this season. Frank Ntilikina is better than Jrue Holiday. RJ is basically MJ. Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox are both better than Kevin Durant. Mitchell Robinson is basically Wilt.
"I wouldn't HATE taking on Love's contract to get Sexton, even if it would eat up a bunch of our cap for 2022. I feel like missing out on Sexton to try and gamble on free agents next year might not work out for us. And we could still get one big 2022 free agent potentially, like Zach LaVine.  Sexton - LaVine - Barrett - Randle - Mitchell Robinson is a great starting lineup  ??? - Quickley - ??? - Love - Noel (I pray) could be a great bench"
"It‚Äôs ok, him and Mitchell Robinson wore the same number one time, Mr. Bullock is immune to the rules of basketball"
"If your team has a young big like Isaiah Stewart or Mitchell Robinson, you're well acquainted with the rule. Even if you watch a bunch of Javale Mcgee games."
