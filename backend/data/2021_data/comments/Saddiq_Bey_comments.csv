"It‚Äôs why I was scratching my head when people were calling Troy Weaver some kind of genius. Their draft lowkey sucked outside of Saddiq Bey, and they made some really bizarre signings with seemingly no regard for roster construction."
Saddiq Bey is going to be a stud as he develops
first: IQ Tyrese Hali Wiseman(ROY) Lamelo Pat Will  Second:  Devin Vassell Desmond Bane Tyrese Maxey Cole Anthony Xavier Tillman  Just missed: Payton Pritchard(would be in it if he wasn‚Äôt hurt) Precious Achiuwa Ant Edwards Saddiq Bey Isaiah Stewart Mason Jones
How‚Äôs saddiq bey been this year?
"2019: PJ Washington  2020: Jalen Smith, Deni Avidja. I'm high on all of the wings from last year's draft as well (Okoro, Nesmith, Saddiq Bey, Josh Green)"
"Hayes was starting prior to injury. Isaiah Stewart had been doing well and earned himself the backup 5 spot. Saddiq bey is getting good minutes on the bench and starts on nights that Blake is resting. Sekou is probably getting the least time as he is still raw, but coaches and best writers seem to see him progressing daily in practice. Also kinda unfortunate circumstance for him as he is behind Blake and grant for playing time at the 4"
I'm kind of surprised the Pistons are playing their vets so heavily.  I think they're starting Wright/Ellington/Grant/Griffin/Plumlee. Where's the playing time for Sekou and Saddiq Bey?
"For anyone curious this is what is expected, at the moment it is expected for Cedi to be at the 4, yes.   *Yes.*  And SexLand is expected to start but I'm not even gonna express excitement for the come back this time, because each time I expressed excitement I saw the lineup be changed right after haha  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (8-9) | [](/DET)Pistons (4-13) ---|---   D. Garland |Delon Wright  C. Sexton  |  W. Ellington Isaac Okoro |   Saddiq Bey Cedi Osman |   Jerami Grant A. Drummond |  Mason Plumlee  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (8-9) | [](/DET)Pistons (4-13) ---|---  L. Stevens  (GTD) |    B. Griffin  (OUT) M. Dellavedova (OUT) |    K. Hayes  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |      L. Nance(OUT) |"
"Saddiq Bey is in the same boat. 36/41/78 splits, 25% from 2"
Just to be pedantic the nets traded their pick and we got Saddiq bey... so Another player who's already way better than Shamet.. lmao
"I knew we'd be very bad, definite bottom 3.  Sad to see Killian hurt.  Glad to see our other rookies, Saddiq Bey and Isiah Stewart, look like solid picks so far. And Jerami Grant in balling.  Coaching is fine but you'll always get complaints from fans that we're overplaying mediocre nba vets too many minutes. The time will come in the doldrums of the season where the young guys are let out to run wild so who cares if we play Wayne Ellington 30 minutes a night for the first 2 months if it allows our young guys to safely adjust to the physicality and grind of the NBA, especially this season."
I think Houston would've been happy with Saddiq Bey. He's looking pretty solid
"Team : Pistons  Rookies : Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart  &amp;#x200B;  Hayes looked really rough, his handles was bad, he looked pretty slow, he coukdn't make his step back 3's, some decent passes and played hard on defense, I still believe in the ceiling but the floor is super low  Bey : looks great as a shooter, pretty versatile and quick release, completly powerless from 2 for now, really solid defender one on one, moves his feet well, pretty sure he'll have a 10 years career as a 3&amp;D guy at worst  Stewart : plays crazy hard, not really skilled on offense, but hs shown flashes of good defensive potential, I dont like picking centers in the draft, but he's been as good as coud'vve been expected"
Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey
"Dude isiah Stewart is a future starter. The guy hustles and can switch up on defense and play the pick and roll well. This is key in the new nba. He also has a jump shot, but the coaching staff wants to bring him along slowly. Saddiq Bey is averaging around 10 pts a game  and shooting over 40% from 3 pt range, and can guard multiple positions at 6‚Äô9. These guys aren‚Äôt superstars but cmon man this was a weak draft. Pistons trade Bruce brown and kennard because they were going to be free agents next year and they don‚Äôt want to pay players during a rebuild. That future first is top 15 protected with even more protections after the CWood trade. It can end up turning into a second rd pick."
"He just likes to shit on Weaver, always on our sub talking shit. He‚Äôs just mad that Hayes hasn‚Äôt set the world on fire in his first ever 6 games in the nba.   Isiah Stewart is the best rebounder of the draft class; Saddiq Bey is the best shooter; and Hayes can very well develop into the best passer. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù draft by any means."
Saddiq Bey
Saddiq Bey better
both Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart. its been 9 games and i already love them. Sekou too I guess. He hasnt been playing well but id be pissed if we traded him before hes had a full season so play in the NBA
Saddiq Bey is looking Nice
I've been watching Saddiq Bey ever since the Hawks game. Dude's game is so mature for being a rookie.
Pistons: Surprising: Saddiq Bey and Jeremi Grant  Disappointing: Blake Griffin and Killian Hayes
Keep an eye out for Saddiq Bey. He is becoming a reliable 3 point shooter.
"Jerami Grant, Blake and Saddiq bey all looked really good today"
Saddiq Bey is nice with it
Would rather have Saddiq Bey then Shamet bricking every shot
Saddiq Bey on Detroit has looked good from what I've seen.  Jordan Nwora on the Bucks looks like another 2nd round hit for Milwaukee.
Saddiq Bey ... dont sleep on him ....
"Every Nova boys except Spellman have been excellent role players and some with star potential   Donte, Mikal, Brunson, Paschall, Josh Hart, rookie Saddiq Bey"
Saddiq Bey is the steal of the draft. Looks like a future 10+ year NBA starter on the wing.
"The Blazers traded two firsts for Robert Covington when they could‚Äôve just drafted Saddiq Bey, who‚Äôs basically Robert Covington Jr."
At least Isaiah Stewart &amp; Saddiq Bey are looking like pretty good picks.
"Saddiq Bey with 33% fg and 48% from 3. 25 of his 39 are from 3  Thus, 7.1% from 2"
Saddiq Bey about to carry him to his first title
"Saddiq Bey went 7/11 from deep against us over the weekend, while Aaron Nesmith was a DNP-CD. Not great so far!"
"I wanted to take Saddiq Bey at 16 before we gave the pick to Detroit.   He looks decent, we have enough wings anyways.   48% from 3 and 7% from 2  , he‚Äôs currently shooting"
At #14 - Saddiq Bey is looking pretty ready and would help us a ton. Jalen Smith has barely played.  At #26 - Xavier Tillman has barely played.
"For sure, really close and intense series. Before the draft I was really high on Saddiq Bey as a high-end 3&amp;D player and was hoping we'd take him with the 14th pick. His defense is already really good for a rookie and the guy was lighting us up from 3 along with Mykhailiuk lol.  You guys have a really good supporting cast of players already, if Killian Hayes figures it out over his rookie season then you might not even have to rebuild for too long anyways. I was also hoping the Celtics moved up to draft Hayes because he's gonna be a good playmaker - just needs to get used to using his right hand more."
"I would bet my life on him getting in, don‚Äôt worry. Even if the only reason the Celtics got a win against the Pistons is because Saddiq Bey left him open in the corner! Fun little series between our teams. Jaylen is the man. Blake died on that last move from Tatum, too."
"Saddiq Bey should be getting more minutes, but I guess the Pistons are trying to tank.   He's legitimately good. Killian kind of stinks like bust on the other hand."
"I like Saddiq Bey, them Villanova boys are just solid, they just know where to be and when to take their shots. Never seems like he's in a rush of anything"
Saddiq Bey
"Gonna tell you now, SADDIQ BEY ROOKIE OF THE YEAR"
"Mannnn Jerami Grant has really surprised all of Detroit, we scoffed at him wanting to have a bigger offensive role and he‚Äôs out here fucking dunking on Theis, averaging 24 ppg and staying solid defensively! Looking like an all star at this rate.   Saddiq Bey also looking like one of the best rookies of the draft - cant believe we got him at 19 and Killian at 7 lol.    Fully deserved win for the Pistons, loved our tenacity and grit, but Boston also really shit the bed. Went completely scoreless in the last 4 minutes, were awful in the first half, and were only in it due to some Tatum heroics. Excited for the rematch on Sunday üëÄ"
5.6 Rebounds is actually a great improvement for Grant. Dude been horrendously bad rebounding for a guy with Uber athleticism  Also Saddiq Bey is a good rookie
Bruh what're the odds of Saddiq Bey hitting 5 3's ü•¥
Even though the GOAT Saddiq Bey was there?
Need Saddiq Bey to take 10 3s in the 4th!
Saddiq Bey snapping?
"Not in the draft.   3&amp;D players are always considered 'low ceiling', but they are just as rare as other archetypes.  Thats why I mentioned Saddiq Bey. He went 19 in a weak draft."
He was a great pick. Will never understand why people don't value 3&amp;D guys.  Watch Saddiq Bey be a valuable piece too.
"Absolutely not lol. The Pistons are a team that competes very hard. They are just so young and untalented. After grant and Wright, they are heavily relying on DSJ, Josh Jackson, Saben Lee, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart. 2 of those guys were busts and the other 3 are rookies. And that‚Äôs after losing Blake to a buy out and Rose to a trade. No coach is winning with a roster like that.   Compare that with their neighbors in the standings like the Magic, Timberwolves, Kings, Pelicans, Wizards, Rockets, etc who in my opinion who have much more talented rosters but are performing worse based on their expectations."
"It was ultimately a 3-team trade where Detroit traded Brown, Kennard, and 4 second rounders for the 19th pick in the draft (Saddiq Bey) and another future second rounder.  Not terrible."
"Pistons fan here. The Bruce trade helped us get Saddiq Bey, and Christian Wood didn't want to be here."
"Someven thomhe won eastern confernce player of the week, Saddiq Bey isnt playing? Ok."
Saddiq Bey?
Wtf what is this? Where is Saddiq Bey?   This is snubbery of the highest degree
Bane and Tillman have both started and looked good in Memphis.   Maxey has looked good in spots.   Saddiq Bey has been awesome.   Pat Will has been very good.
"I wouldn‚Äôt mind if Saddiq Bey got a invite, maybe it‚Äôs homerism, but I think he‚Äôd put up a genuine fight"
Saddiq Bey
"James Khristian Middleton.  Also Saddiq Bey, apparently?"
"I feel like we keep getting hit by huge games from role players. Gallo dropped 38 on us a few days ago, Jalen Brunson had a big night, the Pistons slaughtered us with Delon Wright and Saddiq Bey a while back. Anyone else feel like this has been happening a lot?"
"Bey looks like a great pick as does Williams. If Saddiq can improve his handle and clean the defense a bit, he's a great 3andD wing.  Williams can be a supersized wing stopper that can create offense, allowing immense lineup flexibility.  Halliburton is going to be a great player, possible All-Star material"
I was gonna add Tate but I replaced with with Saddiq Bey
Saddiq Bey? What the hell
"Saddiq Bey, Bradley Beal, Nikola Jokic, Trae Young, Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Luka Doncic and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Danilo fucking Gallinari"
Saddiq Bey about to clamp him
Obviously the Pistons are sending Player of the Week Saddiq Bey
"Wiggins was still second fiddle to a much better player in KAT. Who is Jerami trying to share the ball with, Saddiq Bey and the ghost of half of Blake Griffin?"
Saddiq Bey snubbed?
Yep Saddiq has been balling. I'm still kinda annoyed that we traded Shamet for Bey because a stretch 4 that can play D was exactly what we needed. But Shamet's been picking it up lately and we got Bruce Brown so that makes up for it.
Got Saddiq Bey out of it
"First of all, Wiseman didn‚Äôt get a decreased role as he is playing the same amount of minutes as he always had. You keep bringing up he‚Äôs getting benched but in reality his role is still the same bc he still is playing more min than Looney who is the starting center. 2nd, his numbers are as good as they appear and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an anomaly to me that he‚Äôs playing so few minutes. I understand that in bad games, he should play little min but why is he playing so few min in good games as well? My main point is that Wiseman playing so few min is not his fault. You act like it‚Äôs his fault he‚Äôs not playing so few min when I disagree heavily. I think he‚Äôs performing better than rookies that are averaging more minutes than him like payton pritchard, Saddiq Bey, Cole Anthony, killian hayes, Isaac okoro, etc. I really think that the only rookies performing better than him that are averaging more minutes are Lamelo and Haliburton. I don‚Äôt see how Wiseman is playing so bad to the point where he deserves less minutes than those other guys."
Edwards has been awful. Give me Saddiq Bey over him.
Saddiq Bey robbed
I understand harden but saddiq bey seriously

"Saddiq Bey is going to murder the Celtics for the next decade, I can feel it."
"Well Killian was eh, but he only played 7 games and got injured so I can't really make a fair assessment. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty good, and Saddiq Bey has been a top 10 rookie thus far."
"If you're the GM of the Pistons, nah just hold his contract unless you can get a good buyout  If you're talking about fantasy, yeah you should drop him. I picked up Saddiq Bey and I think he should be good value"
"Isaiah Stewart has been dubbed Beef Stew by Pistons twitter and the fans are calling their selves the Stew Crew  Saddiq Bey has been called Big Diq Bey and I'm really hoping fans start calling theirselves Diqheads.  Killian has gotten more hate than anything because of his struggles followed by injury, but him and Sekou have been called the French Revolution which will be really cool if they actually end up being good players in the longrun."
Still can‚Äôt believe they gave it to Saddiq Bey... like come on now what are we doing here
"Shamet, Saddiq Bey, a first, and two seconds.  The Clips used the Miami 2021 first in the PG trade I think."
I've come to witness the greatness of Saddiq Bey
\#6. Saddiq Bey
I never heard of Saddiq Bey... what a weird name.
Who? I doubt a no name like that has ever won Player of the Week. It‚Äôs reserved for stars like Saddiq Bey.
Saddiq bey should be in there
"In my opinion, it's kinda a win-win for Detroit.   Not only are they significantly better without him on the floor, but his absence will create far greater opportunities for young players like Saddiq bey and Sekou Doumbouya. His presence on their roster has been suffocating for the development of the young talent."
tell that to Saddiq Bey
I'll take it.   I went into this past year's draft hearing great things about Killian Hayes but not know much about Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart. Now Bey and Stew might be my two favorite Pistons. They've been a lot of fun to watch this year.
Saddiq Bey and who??
"The Pistons are in development mode so makes sense to me. Griffin has no future with this team, and the minutes he plays could be better spent on further developing young guys like Josh Jackson or Saddiq Bey."
Saddiq Bey is more of a 3 and D than go to scoring option
Imagine giving Saddiq Bey less minutes then Kuzma. Dude has way more potential then Kuz.
‚ÄúROTY contender Saddiq Bey‚Äù   ‚ÄúAbsolute stud Isaiah Stewart‚Äù  ‚ÄúJosh Jackson has been incredible‚Äù
Troy Weaver won‚Äôt get it because the pistons are bad but he‚Äôs been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who‚Äôs now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
Saddiq bey szn
Yeah? Like drafting Khris Middleton at 39 or Dinwiddie at 38?  Or how about recently Saddiq Bey at 19? How's your boy Nesmith doing? Your genius franchise drafted him at 14 LMFAO
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

It's obviously a hindsight take, but Ainge could've drafted Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, Saddiq Bey and Desmond Bane over the past few years. If you've established your core with Tatum/Brown/Smart then there's no reason not to take a chance on older prospects who could contribute immediately."
Saddiq Bey going to be in this discussion by the end of the year
I see a distinct lack of Saddiq Bey
"I've been really enjoying saddiq bey, but I feel like there's no questions no competition this year. Lamelo is practically leading the team this year and is flashy and entertaining to boot."
Saddiq Bey is built different
waaaaaa waaaaa waaaaaaaaaa üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ saddiq bey is bad celtics good üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
Hahahahah  Saddiq Bey is almost as far away from number 1 shooting as the Pistons are from making the playoffs... your stat is simply made up
Saddiq bey is like 5th rookie in shooting though so I wanna know where u came up with that stat?
"&gt;Saddiq Bey has shot a combined 12/15 from 3 in both Detroit's wins vs the Celtics.  Saddiq ""Khris Middleton"" Bey"

"Saddiq ""Wee"" Bey is a cold blooded killer."
"Sometimes it comes down to which team is hungrier.  Cleary the C's wanted to hug that L more than your quote-unquote Bad Boys. Deal with it.  If you want to point fingers, maybe talk to your bro Saddiq Bey, clearly that m'fer didn't get the memo as he was racking up a career night against the Celtics.   Your team is legit trash. Watching them play, all I could think of was that Saddiq Bey and Delon Wright, will never be the 1-2 punch on a tanking team. If you want to legit tank, the Pistons have to find worse players than these 2.   I watched them make play after play, and hit shot after contested shot. Fucking losers. If either of those guys had that killer DNA, they would have done a better job of missing their shots and drawing offensive fouls.  I'm sorry that we stole the loss from your guys tonight, but the Pistons played less worse than the Celtics, and didn't have what it takes to be the worst team in the EC."
Saddiq Bey? More like Saddiq Klay
"Former Blazer great, Saddiq Bey."
"Celtics fans in this thread are so reactionary. Coming off a west coast road trip, on the second night of a back-to-back, missing Kemba and Smart. Smart drives us all nuts when he throws up some questionable shots but I think the time without him has proved how valuable he is to our team. He just makes game winning plays and we‚Äôre definitely missing that.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Detroit outplayed us and deserved this win, but I‚Äôm getting kind of tired of the cycle of ‚ÄúAinge needs to be fired, Brad needs to be fired, [player] needs to be traded‚Äù  Tatum-Brown-Kemba-Smart have been on the floor together 2 games, and both of those Kemba was on minutes restriction so they had to stagger minutes and Smart got hurt in the second game. They literally haven‚Äôt been at full strength the whole season. I get it, we‚Äôve been inconsistent (because we‚Äôve had to rely on a bench of a rookie and role players), but we‚Äôre in the 4 seed at the moment. Celtics fans gotta relax.  Saddiq Bey played a hell of a game too"
We really gave up our pick in exchange for Landry Shamet and then the pick turned out to be what we hoped Landry Shamet would be (and then some) in Saddiq Bey
Saddiq Bey is a baller. Best draft pick we‚Äôve had in a long time. I‚Äôm really liking this competitive tank thing we‚Äôve got going on.
Saddiq Bey has shot a combined 12/15 from 3 in both Detroit's wins vs the Celtics.   I called the 1st game a fluke. I will never go out of my way to disrespect Saddiq Bey ever again.
Villanova legend Saddiq Bey
lmao Saddiq Bey Ojeleye'd us
Pistons are a pain in the ass lmao. Saddiq Bey is something else
LeGM is gonna be on the phone all night trying to get Saddiq Bey to LA.
This will teach you a lesson to never bet against saddiq bey
Saddiq bey is a guy I wanted to draft :( I like josh green I think he‚Äôs going to develop really nicely and I have faith in our FO but owie
Saddiq bey is 7/7 from three right now
Saddiq Bey plays the Celtics like he agrees with me that they should've drafted him at #14.
I love Saddiq Bey so much
Saddiq Bey going full Pol Pot and treating the C's like Cambodians.
"It's good to see Saddiq Bey getting some recognition, he's a beast"
This dude has low key been one of the better players in this draft. Detroit did pretty well overall drafting Saddiq Bey and Stewart. Hayes has been somewhat disappointing but he‚Äôs young and still adjusting to the NBA
"Yeah, it's bittersweet watching these guys perform well.  I had picks assorted by a range:  1. LaMelo 1-3 2. Haliburton 4-12 3. Hampton 13-18 4. Saddiq Bey 18-24  All 4 have looked pretty good so far, it's maybe been my best-guessed draft so far."
Biased but saddiq bey doesn't get enough love (idk about all rookie team tho)
"besides the ones mentioned, i like Saddiq Bey from the Pistons. I think not for the first team, but maybe second or so."
yeah Bey looked pretty good out there. I‚Äôm still salty we traded our pick (for landry shamet of all people) instead of drafting Saddiq or Precious.
Saddiq Bey? More like Happydiq Bey
F you Saddiq Bey
Yeah not enough credit to the Pistons. Grant is a beast.  Seeing Saddiq Bey score 15 hurt though.
"Saddiq Bey, just trust me he's a beast for a rookie"
"Bruce brown unfortunately didn‚Äôt really have a place on our team. We had drose, and just drafted killian at the 1 so we wanted to give him plenty of minutes to develop. Our other guards are Josh Jackson (whose def an improvement of Bruce brown), svi who is intriguing and I believe still has room to develop, saddiq bey who we just drafted whose been playing minutes at multiple positions, and Wayne Ellington who is a great veteran to have and has been killing it this season. We had too many players at that position and while he was good on defense Bruce‚Äôs scoring did not have the same ceiling as the other guys. His playmaking is good, but seems like there just wasn‚Äôt enough for weaver to want to keep him as a point guard after drafting hayes"
"Got Jerami Grant, drafted pretty well in Saddiq Bey, Stewart and maybe Hayes. Not re-signing Wood was bad, but they could have done much worse"
Manifesting Saddiq Bey Finals MVP  Cade Saddiq Jerami Grant big 3?
FUCK IT Saddiq Bey ROTY
And from outta nowhere Saddiq Bey steals the award with an SKO on Tyrese Halliburton.  It‚Äôs up in the air at this moment with Melo out.  Any top 5 rookie may be able to take it at this point if they can finish the next 1.5(?) months of reg. season strong
"The Pistons are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA - so I'd say a F.  The team's only pure shooters are Wayne Ellington (a vet who needs other to get him shots) Saddiq Bey (a rookie who is still inconsistent) &amp; Frank Jackson (a 2-way player who is shooting well form 3 for the first time in his career).  On top of that, the only offensive creators on the team are Jerami Grant (who is not yet a good passer), Hamidou Diallo (who only recently arrived in Detroit) and Josh Jackson (who is very inefficient).   On a bright side - the Pistons actually have a solid defensive team."
With Saddiq Bey coming off the bench.
Saddiq Bey is the man
"I had just always assumed but this made me look into it, is Saddiq Bey really not Muslim?"
Saddiq Bey will be an all star within 5 years
Saddiq Bey will be an all star in 3 years
"Saddiq Bey, jaesean tate. Terrance Mann. Quickly"
"Nova products have been great lately. Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Eric Paschall, Donte Divencenzo, Josh Hart, Omare Spellman‚Äôs played some fair minutes, Saddiq Bey, Arcidiacano‚Äôs in the Bulls rotation.   All players from 2016-2020"
Saddiq Bey is probably the most underrated rookie this season. Jaden McDaniels has been amazing for the Wolves. Okeke has been a nice piece for the Magic. Tate has been just really solid recently too
"I think Saddiq Bey is going to be a really good pro. Maybe not a star (tho who knows) but easily see him being a highly coveted role player every team would want who can do a bit of everything, play multiple positions, score and defend. Those guys tend to have long careers."
Saddiq Bey
"Saddiq Bey has been a true pleasure to watch develop. At risk of being a pistons homer, Isaiah Stewart has shown a lot of flashes this year!"
"Eh, it‚Äôs not rude to say that about a team that basically nobody other than devoted fans keeps track of. Well, for one Saddiq Bey is easily one of the top-5 rookies in this year‚Äôs draft class and is arguably the second best three point shooter in it after Haliburton, so that‚Äôs something pretty much every Pistons fan is excited about. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty exciting to watch for us as well because of his defensive-minded and aggressive style of play, which is pretty much the definition of Pistons basketball, he also shown flashes of outside shooting which would make him a really nice building block moving forward, oh and he‚Äôs 19 years old so he‚Äôll have plenty of time to develop here. Hayes doesn‚Äôt look like much just yet, but he‚Äôs also nineteen, is already a decent playmaker, has good size and plenty of potential. We also have a bunch of young players who have a good chance to help the team in long term, like Diallo, Saben Lee and Josh Jackson(who is a Detroit native and has been playing his heart out for us) and a bunch of cheap guys that we took a flyer on who try their best to prove their worth as NBA players(DSJ, Cook, Okafor, also Josh Jackson is in this category as well), never mind Grant proving himself as an All-Star candidate level of player. Also for the first time since 2003 we have a good chance of getting a high pick in the next draft which already looks quite promising. Obviously it‚Äôs not the same as having Sexland and Allen as far as young cores and concerned, but Garland and Sexton weren‚Äôt exactly spectacular their first year either, were they? So yeah, for the first time in forever Pistons have a clear direction and a definitive young group of players to build with and it‚Äôs quite nice to watch for the franchise that‚Äôs been suffering through mediocrity for the last 13 years. We‚Äôre in a rebuild right now, but I‚Äôd argue watching this team has been the most fun I‚Äôve had as a Pistons fan since what feels like forever."
"Saddiq bey, Isaiah Stewart, and saben lee. Killians been injured but he‚Äôs shown flashes of being a great defender and excellent passer. Not to mention whoever we take in the upcoming draft."
"Saddiq Bey almost with the Bojan special. 25 points, one assist, nothing else."
"**Killian Hayes** - started off slow, has looked like he has a much better pulse on our offensive movement since returning two games ago but still isn't scoring much. Really wish his success hadn't been tied to everyone's opinion of Kevin O'Connor because he's an extremely talented rookie who's been fine for what he was advertised, but because he isn't running away with RotY he's already been labeled a bust by some  **Isaiah Stewart** - was a fan favorite from day 1 for his hustle, but now his skill is starting to shine through and it's really exciting. He has shot 42% from deep (on limited attempts) and is above 50% from 10-16ft. His defensive hustle is insane (I believe he's leading rookies in Blocks per game) and he's a great offensive rebounder. He'll be fun to watch for a long time.  **Saddiq Bey** - came in as an NBA ready shooter (as advertised) but has shown a bit more ability than even that. He's put together a few moves with his back to the basket, can create his own 3 in a way that looks suspiciously identical to Wayne Ellington, and has put the ball on the floor as well. If he becomes a playmaker as well as a shooter, he should be a future all star.  **Saben Lee** - Isn't a revelation or anything but he looks like he'll last in the league which is pretty cool for a 2nd rounder. You can tell he's not comfortable with his shot but his ability to get to the rim and get fouled (or make the extra pass) has allowed him to stay on the floor. He also came very close to posterizing Vucevic so that was fun.  .  All in all, a pretty solid but VERY productive draft for Weaver's first year as GM. The future is exciting in Detroit."
"Imagine then if Edwards,LaMelo,Hali,Saddiq Bey etc all had allocated time to improve."
I'm not a Pistons fan but always root for the Pistons. I've probably watched more Pistons games this year than most people who aren't Pistons fans. I think the future looks bright. At PG rookie Killian Hayes is a question mark but a good PG is not hard to find in this league. At SG Hamidou Diallo seems like an exciting athletic player who is a good defender and explosive scorer. At SF rookie Saddiq Bey seems like a solid defender and very good 3pt shooter. At PF Jerami Grant has been playing great and looks like one of the most improved players in the NBA this year. At C rookie Isaiah Stewart provides a strong defensive presence and has a good ability to score down low
Saddiq bey is a beast
We‚Äôll never get less than 49 points in a game as long as saddiq bey is our tank commander üò§
Bruh Shane Larkin is one of the best players over thereüíÄ. Fucking Saddiq Bey would drop like 40 on their heads lmao.
"And he‚Äôs somehow shooting threes. Don‚Äôt forget that bit.   When we drafted him with 16, I was slightly pissed because I thought we should have taken Bey. Luckily we got Saddiq as well."
"NGL, I totally forgot the Pistons drafted someone else In the first round besides Saddiq Bey."
Saddiq bey been really good for us along with Stewart. Beys a top 5-10 rookie despite being drafted 19
Hawks fans mad as fuck at Kevin Huerter but I know he sold at the end of regulation because he saw Trae's box score stats and wanted to give him an opportunity to fix his shooting splits. What a bro for real  Still hope him and a first round pick ends up in a Pistons uniform next season for Saddiq Bey Insha'Allah
"I‚Äôd say Saddiq Bey is good, but I‚Äôm biased and no one is close to Lamelo."
If that deal wasn't on the table no guarantee they take Saddiq Bey. I think if you just consider the actual value of the average pick at that spot it was a good deal
shamet sucks. That was a bad trade. They could've had Saddiq Bey
"I like poku, but he's gotta get to where he can shoot over 30% from the field consistently. I like that he's getting the minutes to get comfortable though.. and he def isn't scared to keep throwing it up there even if he missed his last 10 shots.   Saddiq Bey is the actual most underrated rookie imo."
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
How tf is Jaesean Tate above Saddiq Bey
"&gt;1. Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings  &gt;2. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves  &gt;3. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks  &gt;4. Jae‚ÄôSean Tate, Houston Rockets  &gt;5. Saddiq Bey, Detroit Pistons"
Is saddiq bey muslim? Offtopic
"When the Jazz didn't make a move to try and grab Saddiq Bey, I was hoping they'd grab Bane, he seems looke a perfect fit for them."
"I was really hoping Danny would pick Saddiq Bey at 14 essentially just because he played at 'Nova which is basically a guarantee that a player will at least be serviceable in the league.  I think Nesmith will figure it out long-term, but Bey really felt like an obvious move.  I haven't even seen Jeremiah Robinson-Earl play but fuck it, I'm jumping on his hype train lol.  Jay Wright is phenomenal at developing players in that college-to-NBA pipeline."
If the Pistons keep Wood they don't get Saddiq Bey and Isiah Stewart.
"Me: Mom, can we get Saddiq Bey?  Mom: We have Saddiq Bey at home  *At Home: Aaron Nesmith*   This is just a joke btw, I‚Äôm very hopeful for Nesmith and like the pick still."
"Pistons with Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Saben Lee, Killian Hayes, and one of Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Evan Mobley is a budding dynasty"
Saddiq Bey   19 points 5/7 from 3   Love this kid

that's a big if. i'm just happy if at least saddiq bey becomes a star.
"You know he only played in 20 something games between those 2 dunks right? Never in those games did he have as wide open of a lane as he did in his first game with Brooklyn. The nets have about 4 more weapons on the floor at any given time than Detroit did this season or the last game he played before being shut down in 2019 for surgery.  In Detroit this season, he was used as a playmaker who couldn't make plays. A guy who sat on the 3 pt line because athletically speaking, he couldn't really do much else. The team played so so much better when they didn't have to involve him. He was playing 30+ minutes per night as well, so he very well could have been deliberately not dunking when he had opportunities just as a way to save his body (his knees, specifically) over the course of a season at that high of usage.  Conversely, Brooklyn doesn't really need him and he doesn't get much attention so he's got more opportunities to take open shots and occasionally get to the rim.  Defensively, you see all the issues with his athleticism on full display. People are really loving that highlight of him throwing down the lob in Detroit the other night, but almost nobody has seen the lowlight a few plays later when Saddiq Bey just absolutley cooked past him for an easy dunk.  Real Detroit fans and real NBA fans who watched him in Detroit this season would not say he was dogging it. Just watch the man run and you can see there's something wrong with him.  Here's the play if you haven't seen it:  [https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1375619933875265541](https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1375619933875265541)"
"Saddiq ""Hey there"" Bey"
Hamidou Diallo and Saddiq Bey are so fun to watch.
I will always hate the nets and now especially since Blake griffin is there but you got one of the good ones with Bruce Brown. I hated to see him leave Detroit but it worked out in the end because it let him go to a winner and we got saddiq bey.
I‚Äôll try for our team:  ‚Ä¢ Jerami Grant ‚Ä¢ Mason Plumlee ‚Ä¢ Saddiq Bey ‚Ä¢ Isaiah Stewart ‚Ä¢ Wayne Ellington ‚Ä¢ Dennis Smith Jr. ‚Ä¢ Saben Lee ‚Ä¢ Josh Jackson ‚Ä¢ Frank Jackson ‚Ä¢ Rodney Mcgruder
They already have Saddiq Bey tho wouldn‚Äôt Trent be kind of redundant on that roster?
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."
"While I'm naturally in favor of any top 10 list that includes Isaiah Stewart, I don't think Saddiq Bey has been the Pistons 3rd best rookie this season."
"Maxey right now is down 1 tier for me with guys like Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Kira Lewis, Patrick Williams, and Okoro. Flashed potential and has a future in the league but still is battling for his role. Give him time and I think he will have a nice career though."
"Makes less than zero sense. He and Grant are basically the same positionally, and while you could play them together, Saddiq Bey should be getting all the minutes as a starter at SF."
Buddy hield  Saddiq bey had career games every single time against us  Duncan Robinson  Kris Middleton not a role player but man hates us
"I think there was just a lot of questions on all the top guys. There was no clear cut star at the top like Zion or Ben Simmons. A lot of the questions have come back with positives. Ant is still raw but not too raw to play in the NBA. Lamelo has been a lot more well rounded then anyone expected. Wiseman has been hurt off and on all season so it is hard to really get a judge of him, but when he does play he is a positive for the team. Quickley, Saddiq Bey, Haliburton, Maxey, Patrick Williams etc etc, lots of players are helping their teams win games. This draft at this point feels closer to 2018 then it does to 2000."
You have Grant and the resurgence of DSJ and.... I guess Saddiq Bey?
Saddiq Bey is better than Quickly.
Like Saddiq Bey?
"My favorite player is Saddiq Bey and I'm a Pistons fan, but go off."
Saddiq Bey is doing a better job than both
"You underestimate how many guys we like to leave open. Danilo Gallinari would like to have a word. Saddiq Bey has some highlights to show you.   It's nothing personal to Kyrie, we just fucking suck at defense this year. We let someone score 30 basically every game, and it's not just the stars that do it."
"Quickley, Desmond Bane, Saddiq Bey.  But those are all the players the Mavs could have gotten instead of Josh Green sooooooooo"
He should not have been starting at all. Saddiq Bey was clearly more effective the entire time
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven‚Äôt seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I‚Äôm not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we‚Äôve played a lot better than our record so I‚Äôm optimistic for the first time in a long time."
"Okoro, Jaden McDaniels, Payton Pritchard, Xavier Tillman have all also been better defensively in my opinion. That also doesn't include players I think are more arguable but are there is also Desmond Bane, James Wiseman, Patrick Williams, and Saddiq Bey."
"Does it? Players fall all the time, with or without red flags (2020: Haliburton, Maxey, Saddiq Bey, Achiuwa)"
"Mason Plumlee  Saddiq Bey  Josh Jackson  Saban Lee  Actually committing to a rebuild instead of perpetually drafting 12th  Delon Wright(grabbed them a few seconds)  Derrick Rose (grabbed them a young prospect and a second)  Isaiah Stewart   They have been shitty but competitive, one of the most enjoyble rebuilds in the league rn"
Detroit's not really the place for selfish stars. Plus I think most people are pretty happy about our new rookie core. I see a lot of people talking about Saddiq Bey and Beef Stew making first and second team all rookie.
Saddiq Bey ROTY
Saddiq Bey has quietly broke some rookie scoring/shooting records but sadly did far from enough to even reach the conversation
"Who is he replacing on this list: Ball, Edwards, Haliburton, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, Saddiq Bey, Quickley, Okoro, Bane, Cole Anthony, Campazzo, Stewart, Jaden McDaniels, Wiseman. He‚Äôs gotta be better than 4 people to make it"
"Killian Hayes gets a shot boost. Suddenly he is an excellent passer, shooter and defender with size at the PG position.   Saddiq Bey gets the athleticism boost. A lights out shooter with the ability to attack the basket and finish at the rim.   Isaiah Stewart has 3 inches added to his frame. He goes from being an undersized C to a top-level talent."

Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart üò§
Yeah still seeing people saying it about saddiq bey and Isaiah Stewart too
At the deadline they offered Bagley to the Pistons for Saddiq Bey. The Pistons declined.
"Two of our rookies ‚Äî Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart ‚Äî have received all-rookie first team talk the whole season, while Killian Hayes is raising eyebrows all over the place with his playmaking (if you don‚Äôt believe me, consult Zach Lowe‚Äôs latest column and a recent video analysis by Kevin O‚ÄôConnor).   Of all the tanking teams, we have been by far the most competitive game to game, and our rookies-only tank lineups end up winning games they aren‚Äôt supposed to, with fans from opposing teams regularly tipping their hats to the young guys‚Äô spirit.    We‚Äôre also on track to get a top-five pick in the upcoming draft and our highest-paid player, Jerami Grant, is by far a net positive and totally bought in to playing in Detroit and seeing the rebuild through.   So take it back. Take it back!!!"
C'mon man most people loved the Saddiq Bey pick
"I think so, because he was the ROY leader before his injury, then Ant took the lead when Lamelo was out, but now that he's back and fresh in the minds of voters, I think he'll get the votes to win.  But hey, I'm just happy we have a legit ROY race. Two legit candidates! Three if you include Haliburton. And shouts to Saddiq Bey and Immanuel Quickley too."

"As a Mavs fan, I knew the trade was junk as I watched the Sixers' playoff games. Between this and them not drafting Saddiq Bey, it was a major L by the FO."

Is Saddiq Bey the only rookie on this list?
"&gt;Saddiq has proven himself in this league and defined his role, Nesmith has still yet to do so. That‚Äôs why one is considered 3&amp;D and the other is not.  My point is that Bey is getting the reps + green light to take his shots... He's getting the minutes + opportunities despite his mistakes earlier on in the season. Nesmith made one mistake in a few games due to being a rookie, and then ends up DNP-CD'ED for like a week straight, because CBS is prioritizing winning.   I could provide million examples of how Nesmith is busting his ass on the defensive end and making a coach pleased. But you guys don't give a shit cause we're Celtics fans. So it is what it is.  Anyways, this isn't going to go anywhere since no one thinks Nesmith is even good lol. So have a good one my guy, and I'm happy for the Pistons.  Hayes/Sekou/Bey/Stewart is a nice young core moving forward."
"Lol, and Saddiq Bey is a 3&amp;D player too? Okay."
"Tbh I‚Äôm just happy you put up Saddiq Bey there, we really drafted an NBA ready 3&amp;D at pick 19 looooool"
Jaden McDaniels is the steal of the draft. Idc what anybody else says. Only one you could argue with is Saddiq Bey
"Well, the Kings offered Bagley to the Pistons for Saddiq Bey, and the Pistons declined"
They couldn't even get Saddiq Bey for him which is sad considering his potential
Considering that they wanted Saddiq Bey? Yes. But considering that Troy Weaver laughed them off? I wouldn‚Äôt count on it.
"Now Brian, you're arguing that Saddiq Bey should be rated higher than Lamelo Ball but you're arguing that Lamelo Ball should be the rookie of the year."
Saddiq Bey actually has played 80% of the season...
My fellow media brethren should feel ashamed for rating Saddiq Bey over LaMelo Ball
I can't believe the athletic redrafted this guy ahead of saddiq bey
"the washington boys (mcdaniels and stewart), saddiq bey + tillman as steals atm for me then maledon, KJ in a tier below"
"Yeah no disrespect to the Hawks, as we saw that glorious day in February, you guys could easily make us look like a high school team. That's the problem with the Celtics though, especially this year: Will Tatum lay his nuts out on the table and go blow-for-blow with Steph Curry to the tune of 44 points on 16-25 shooting, or will he go 3-17 against the Bulls without Zach LaVine? Will they handle Jokic as well as any team has all year and force him to take himself out of the game, or will they let Saddiq Bey go 7-7 from 3? There's just no fucking way to tell what team is going to show up this year. We had just won 7 of 10 against some really good teams, and handled some bad teams, and then yesterday we got blown the fuck out by a Hornets team missing their best two players while we are at full health minus Rob Williams.   This has been an insane season to follow the Celtics closely."
"Like I've been saying, if the Warriors traded down and drafted a Saddiq Bey or Devin Vassell or some guy who projected as a role player, and then signed a veteran center in free agency, they'd be a top 4 seed. Part of this is the schedule being easier but a lot of it is undeniable. One of those two losses was that close game to Boston, who knows how it goes if JTA doesn't have to leave, since he's a member of their closing lineup.  And as far as Curry's ability to ""carry a team"", none of the people he gets compared with ever had to deal with a high school center like Wiseman on their roster getting big minutes. Closest was LeBron in 2018-2019 with the young Laker guys like Ingram and Ball and he went 1 game over .500 in the games he played. Curry is now like 30-23 in the games he's played this season (although some of them are indeed without Wiseman). Not to mention he already proved the ""carry a team"" shit earlier in his career back when people weren't paying attention to the Warriors."
"I don‚Äôt think Bey is ‚Äúclearly‚Äù the best Detroit rookie. Stewart is also really fucking good and could arguably be our best, he‚Äôs a plus defender &amp; has a plus impact on the game. &amp; Hayes has the potential to be better than all of them, he‚Äôs got elite passing + vision like Lamelo does.  Saddiq gets all the praise but Stewart is so slept on. Personally I‚Äôm much higher on Beef Stew"
Didn‚Äôt pistons get Saddiq Bey?
Saddiq Bey can play the 3 with them in spurts and you can stagger them. Top 5 picks almost never ever start in the G league unless they suck in the NBA.
"All depends on whether Killian Hayes and Saddiq Bey take another step or not, I could definitely see them being a pretty good team next year given a top 4 pick"
"You guys really whiffed that Deni Avdija pick. He‚Äôs an excellent ball handler &amp; passer, but that‚Äôs the opposite of what you guys need at the wing. A guy like Saddiq Bey or Devin Vassell would have made this team so much better."
"The other day against Cleveland, Saddiq Bey was 6/6 from three in the first 10 mins of the game   He finished with 20 pts"
The Anti Saddiq Bey
&gt; Saddiq Bey  Bey has been fantastic but he's also not playing under the same level of pressure as THT which puts them at about equal in my eyes.
Saddiq Bey &gt; Talen Horton Tucker
"We had such a great draft gah damn. Saddiq Bey at #3, Isaiah Stewart #7. Big things happening in Detroit soon"
"Harris, Blake, Rose, Knight pre-injury, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey. You don‚Äôt gotta tell me it was an ass decade, I know. Idk what you‚Äôre even trying to do right now. Dre was a losing player, he contributed to L‚Äôs, not W‚Äôs. He was never the best player on any team."

"Saddiq Bey been balling lately,had an off night against the Wizards but other than that he‚Äôs looked very solid"
SADDIQ BEY
"Mobley is a weird fit on the Pistons for me, they already have Isaiah Stewart/Saddiq Bey/Sekou who can theoretically be their starting frontcourt; I'm relatively low on Sekou but I think the other two have great upside. Suggs would be a really good fit with Killian Hayes and they don't have great guards after Hayes."
"3 way, Kennard went to the Clippers.  Pistons got the Nets pick and drafted... Saddiq Bey.  Who won?  Who lost?"
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."
Saddiq Bey 50 piece basically?
"Great look to see the angle and have the confidence to throw it, but Bey made an even better catch. The ball took a short hop right at his feet and he's running full speed. Good shit all around tbh.   Plus it's always nice to know that Saddiq Bey does actually score points against a team other than the Celtics, and there is visual proof of it right here!"
This year's Pistons rookie crop is super cool. Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart are my favorite rookies in *yearrrrrs*. Then there's Killian and Saben Lee to boot.
"For the Pistons: Killian Hayes, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Sekou Doumbouya and Isaiah Stewart"
"&gt;Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...? Man   You just listed quite a few terrific players. Would be by far the best best in the league"
You just made this thread to make the Saddiq Bey joke
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
"We drafted Josh Green over Saddiq Bey.  We have so, so many misses over my Mavs fandom."
Not Beef Stew and Saddiq Bey?
"Top 10 rookies this season in no particular order: Edwards, Ball, Haliburton, Stewart, Tate, Patrick Williams, Saddiq Bey, Immanuel Quickley, Isaac Okoro, and Cole Anthony. I'd also potentially put Okeke, Campazzo, Wiseman, Bane, and Maledon above Flynn for their body of work so far.  Flynn's been great for a couple weeks, if he keeps it up until the end of the season maybe he cracks the All Rookie team ahead of someone like Quickley who doesn't have as much opportunity down the stretch."
"Jerami Grant, no, Saddiq Bey"
Saddiq Bey
"Bob why pass up on Saddiq Bey my man, I love Green but comeon Villanova boys have done us right before"
Idk if anyone will see this but when do rookie teams come out? I will be legit mad if saddiq bey or Isaiah Stewart aren‚Äôt on them
I mean another young athletic big with lots of potential is Marvin Bagley yet they couldn‚Äôt even get Saddiq Bey for him
Enjoy Saddiq Bey
I wonder what the disagreements were for the picks.  I'm guessing people wanted saddiq bey over josh green since bey was way better and way less raw coming out?
"&gt;I think they should draft Moses moody, a great 3&amp;D prospect, trade Bagley for picks  They tried trading him for Saddiq Bey and the Pistons didn't want to do it. His trade value is at an all time low."
Personally  luka will take the money up until he hits around 29 years old by that time he will grow frustrated  by not winning championships with the mavericks that team will not improve why porzigas is their only trade chip  Hardaway is gone since he will sign for more then 12 mill next season and they need a couple players coming in if u where Dallas I would reach out to Detroit porzigas for saddiq bey and Isiah stewart or to the kings buddy heild Marvin bagley and their pick 9 Dallas needs more players on their roster to keep donic doing everyday  for them
"Took Reggie, Kennard, Tobias Harris, and Boban. Gave them Blake who swindled them a bit.   They got Saddiq Bey outta the deal though."
Saddiq Bey
"Well we exchanged Kennard for Saddiq Bey, so at least there's that."
they sent away 2nds to the Clippers in that trade for Shamet lol. awful move.  Redeemed themselves by sending Shamet for Saddiq Bey though.
He was offered for Saddiq Bey at the deadline. I thought it was a troll account posting it.
Why would we replace Saddiq Bey(?) with Tingus
any relation to Saddiq Bey ?
"Porzingis has got to go. They have do whatever it takes to trade him this summer.   I also can't believe they traded Curry for Richardson. I thought it was a bad trade when it happened, now it looks flat out egregious. Also taking Green over Saddiq Bey was a really poor decision. Doncic with shooters is nearly unstoppable.  I think Cuban needs to think hard about who's making their decisions going forward. If they keep fucking up, Luka might be gone after his next contract."
Saddiq Bey flamed my ass for 50
"if the pistons traded our young core and/or assets for another +30 year old star, im killing myself. the ebst we have is jerami grant, killian hayes, Isaiah stewart, saddiq bey, and first round picks. both sides say no probably"
"I was there. The arena played him a video tribute and the crowd applauded him at the start, and by halftime the arena was booing him and chanting ‚Äúfuck Blake Griffin‚Äù because of his constant dirty antics and shit talk towards Pistons players, fans, and coaches.   During that game, he elbowed rookie Stewart and [flopped to get him ejected ](https://youtu.be/_5-MUh5AjWg)   He threw down his first lob in over 2 years and yelled at the Pistons bench [‚ÄúI still got it‚Äù](https://youtu.be/T3aCIJM5G0c)  The next play, Bey did an And1 dunk, to which Blake [pushed Saddiq and started chirping](https://youtu.be/cKo3wL12CUc)   All of that rubbed us the wrong way, these were players he was mentoring just weeks ago. Pistons fans don‚Äôt give a shit he started dunking right when he left, it‚Äôs how he handled his return and showed he didn‚Äôt give a shit while playing here. Dude was limping, looked on the brink of retirement and became untradeable; got his buyout to go get a free ring, and immediately is playing with more effort than we seen in 2 years. If he did this shit to your team you wouldn‚Äôt like him either."
He boutta team up with Saddiq Bey
They probably were banking on him being what Bogi has been for the Hawks.  He looked decent with the Pistons in his last year but barely played.  Worst part is they could‚Äôve just asked the nets for there first rounder and drafted saddiq Bey.
Yeah same.   I‚Äôm guessing they hoped he could probably be what Bogi is for the Hawks.   He looked decent with the Pistons in his last year but barely played.  Worst part is they could‚Äôve just asked the nets for there first rounder and drafted saddiq Bey.
None of the Rooks  the Mavs drafted this year even produce.. they could have had Saddiq Bey..
"I‚Äôm buying Terrance Mann, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart stock"
I mean I would for stewart but they have to agree also. That would be a haul. Personally I like Saddiq Bey a lot
I'd trade Saddiq Bey for him.   .      Just wanted to feel part of the thread.
I imagined Bogdan being that secondary ball-handler guy. He's in the starting lineup obviously but he's proven he can be a spark off the bench. I could see either Burks or Saddiq Bey sliding into that wing spot with the main lineup as well.
They extended him without him ever putting on the jersey.  I know it was a three team trade with the nets involved and the Pistons ended up with the 19th pick and took Saddiq Bey. I‚Äôm not sure if the clippers could have gotten that pick or not but can you imagine Saddiq Bey on the roster in rotation with Kawhi and PG on a rookie deal instead  of Luke Kennard for 64 mil.
"Traded a first round pick  for Luke Kennard and a bunch of second round picks then gave him $64 mil before he even put on a jersey.   Pistons took Saddiq Bey with the pick. They could have just took Saddiq Bey, saved a bunch of money, and had a guy that could rotate in and out with Kawhi and PG in the lineup."
"I think that is very short-sighted. Saddiq Bey is already six months older than JJJ. He is not a prospect and was not drafted to be one. He's supposed to be an nba-ready three-point specialist with decent defense and he's so far met the expectations for that. That's why he was a late first rounder. The one caveat being that he's been terribly inefficient from the floor this season and needs refinement on defense. He's not expected to ever be an all-star, his ceiling is a high-value wing on a championship roster (e.g. Danny Green).  But the problem is that Memphis just filled out their roster with solid, older college three-point shooters like Bane, Allen, and just added Melton. I don't see enough of a difference between Bane and Bey's ceilings to throw away JJJ. Besides, JJJ is one of very few shooting bigs with shot-blocking ability in the entire league. He's played basically 1.5 nba seasons. Steph Curry played 5 before even being an all-star and he's a top 5 all time player at his position. There is really no reason to worry about JJJ yet considering he just tore his acl and his per36 numbers (only played 23 mins this year) are already excellent."
Right:      Saddiq Bey: didn‚Äôt expect him to be this good of a shooter so fast but knew he would eventually be a plus shooter and solid defender      Halliburton: again didn‚Äôt know it would be this soon but felt like he had the highest floor of the draft. Looks like his ceiling is much higher too.      Wrong:       Payton Pritchard: knew he was a good shooter but didn‚Äôt think he was going to make it in the league.       Tyrell Terry: thought he would be a sniper. Barely played but results weren‚Äôt promising.
Teams chase these raw upside guys who end up in the G League or out of the league more often than not when guys like Bane and Saddiq Bey just this year fall out of the lottery. Memphis‚Äô entire team is basically a collection of that type of talent
"All teams involved in that trade got a decent return. Detroit got Saddiq Bey and cash considerations, Nets got Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet, Clippers got Luke Kennard and 4 second round picks."
"They lost out on Saddiq freakin' Bey with the pick they gave up. A player who is much better on D than Kennard, shows more athleticism, more skill, and is waay cheaper for the time being."
"also, the pick the nets gave ended up being Saddiq Bey who is better than Shamet and Kennard combined"
Saddiq Bey
**Pistons** (no order)  Killian Hayes  Saddiq Bey  Jerami Grant  Beef Stew  Sekou Doumbouya
I know we‚Äôre used to the Pistons having a super team... but not winning the lottery with Beef Stew AND Saddiq Bey (along with a really solid Killian Hayes as your #3) should be viewed as a failure of an off-season
"Imagine if the Warriors didnt draft Wiseman. They would be better off with Haliburton, Quickely or even Saddiq Bey. Fuck development, Warriors need to win now"
"Looks so good on Saddiq Bey too shiiii. Our rookies deserve better jerseys than what they‚Äôre forced to wear üò´  [This shit is so ass](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fpistonpowered.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1301938764.jpeg) and we‚Äôve had it for like 5 years smfh"
"This is how I feel about Saddiq Bey. Sure he's not even in the running, but idc, I'm just happy we have him."
Saddiq Bey should be 4 over Tate and I'm fine with this list
Saddiq Bey #4
"Charlotte should sign Lonzo and somehow acquire Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, and Bol Bol.   Then their lineup could be:   Ball/Ball  Bey/Bey  Bol Bol"
"True. I was screaming for us to take Murray though. Suns fans at the time were like ""BuT wE aLrEaDy HaVe BoOkEr!""  Suns have been notorious for being fair weather but we definitely have some serious homers. I did nothing but talk shit about Chriss, Bender, Len, Josh Jackson, et al., and was always surprised at how many of our fans would get upset with me and argue in their defense.  Same shit is happening now with Jalen Smith, even though the dude looks like a scrub pick just like most of our other picks. Whenever I complain and wish we drafted Haliburton or Saddiq Bey, they jump down my throat and say, ""GiVE hIm TiMe!""  Because lots of guys that sucks as much ass as he has this year, turned their careers around and became good players? He has put up historically terrible stats, he sucks."
This is how I feel but with Saddiq Bey.
Didn't they give it to like Saddiq Bey or something whack that week too?
10 years from now this post will be bought back and we‚Äôll all be calling OP a prophet like EG while Saddiq bey is grabbing his 4th or 5th scoring title and finals mvp

Tate a beast. He play for the Rockets and deserves it over Flynn imo. I think IQ should make it over Saddiq Bey tho.
Saddiq Bey
"Well he did attend the game with Saddiq Bey, Troy Weaver, and Dwayne Casey, so that miiiight mean something"
"Thanks man. I developed kind of a rubric for this coming season. Basically there‚Äôs four promising paths:   * Klay comes back 90%+  * Wiseman develops into a net positive center  * we hit on one draft pick   * we hit on the other draft pick  If one is true, we‚Äôre in the playoffs. If two are true, we make the second round. If three are true, we‚Äôre entering ‚Äúborderline contender‚Äù status. If all four are true, we‚Äôre among the contenders.   Picture it from this past season: let‚Äôs say we add Klay at 18/3/2 on good splits, Wiseman plays more like Ayton (reg season Ayton, not postseason hero - averaging 14/10), and we get, say, Patrick Williams and Saddiq Bey (closest to 7,14 picks last year that really hit).   That team is 100% a contender. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/‚ÄúAyton‚Äù, Poole/Oubre/Bey/PatWil/Looney, Nico/Baze/Lee/Paschall/Chriss is fantastic"
On the other hand its hard to see any way on this universe he would have been chosen were he not on the spurs. Even with taking saddiq bey and garland into account.  This game helped show why hes a good addition but plenty of players that werent selected have a right to be pissed off at him being there. And as a result plenty of fans will be too.
"I can see it now, Saddiq Bey chase down block on Young to send the Pistons to the finals."
If the pistons were suddenly good next year I wouldn't expect other fans to have watched them that closely this last year is my point. Most people aren't going to have strong opinions on saddiq bey or jerami grant until the pistons make the playoffs and beyond that probably win at least one round. I have no expectations that people will watch the pistons when they're bad.
"They‚Äôve already selected the majority of the team, which means they‚Äôve already contacted a load of people who already told them ‚Äúno‚Äù once, so the list is already narrowed down to other Select Team and cut Senior Team members. Keldon already earned a promotion over all but two other select team members (Saddiq Bey and Darius Garland joined him on the team) and has been practicing with the team for weeks already.  On top of that, the Olympics opening ceremonies start 5 days after their last scrimmage which is this Sunday (and realistically the ceremonies start 4 days after their last game since they have to cross the international date line).   Are you really that surprised that they moved quickly on this one? In this day and age, it is not complicated to contact a list of 10-20 people (spitballing a number there) and get responses back within one day. Especially considering the aforementioned fact that Johnson is already in game shape and has been practicing with the team for weeks? He‚Äôs not even the 30th option for this last roster spot if all conditions were ideal, but these conditions are pretty obviously not ideal."
Is Saddiq Bey is playing shape right now?  That's a point of concern considering Team USA's conditioning is terrible at the moment.
Why not Saddiq Bey?
Someone not as good as Saddiq Bey
" Shoulda picked Saddiq Bey, he's better"
Saddiq Bey is on the USA Olympic team and was on the All-Rookie team
"Ah yes, rigged. For the homebrewed Thunder? The Warriors? Naw, Saddiq Bey needs reinforcements."
Why Keldon Johnson over Saddiq Bey?
"So was Saddiq Bey, but I don't think he should get the 12 man roster spot out of all the other NBA players."
Saddiq Bey tho
"Detroit is going to be next years Charlotte, must watch young core. It's going to be fun with Killian being a pass first PG, Cade possibly playing similar to Luka and Saddiq Bey being a solid young 3 point shooter. Grant isn't a total scrub from 3 either, gonna be a ton of ball movement and hopefully some real exciting highlights as long as Grant agrees to less touches (which he should if he wants to win)"
TIME FOR SADDIQ BEY
"&gt; Keldon Johnson, Darius garland, and saddiq bey to the reserve team.  What the heck. And no Trae, Zion, or Ja?"
Dudes like Joe Maggette and Saddiq Bey are on the select team instead of him.
"They have Kevin love on the team and invited Keldon Johnson, Darius garland, and saddiq bey to the reserve team. Them not even reaching out to Ja is simply bad recruiting on their part"
Be better off with just promoting Saddiq Bey full time
Halliburton is a good defender. If you mean a bigger guy than Saddiq Bey or Patrick Williams could be good.
"There may well end up being a bigger steal than Saddiq Bey, he's just arguably not even better than the dudes who got drafted around him (Precious Achiuwa, Tyrese Maxey, Imm Quickley) because he entered the draft age 21 and was more ready."
Didn't Harambob want him over Saddiq Bey?
Put Saddiq Bey in you cowards
"Darius Garland will be among three guys promoted to Team USA for the team‚Äôs exhibition games, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.   Keldon Johnson and Saddiq Bey will also join Garland, as the trio will replace Devin Booker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday up until the conclusion of the NBA Finals.  source : https://fortyeightminutes.com/darius-garland-among-select-team-players-promoted-to-team-usa/"
"Darius Garland, Keldon Johnson, and Saddiq Bey"
"You're off on the picks. LAC got Shamet, 2020 Philly first that became Saddiq Bey and via 3-team deal turned Shamet into Kennard... And the 2021 MIA unprotected first."
Saddiq bey the only one trying on defense
Jerami grant and Saddiq Bey are what this team really needs. Sad that the huge egos of Tatum and co will not step aside for the good of the country

"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"Because of Larry‚Äôs age yes, but I meant subbing out Larry Bird for Scottie Pippen (two top 50 players in NBA history) is drastically different than subbing out Durant for Jerami Grant or Saddiq Bey (top 50 NBA player in history for an elite role player / unknown potential sophomore)"
Saddiq Bey didn‚Äôt play enough minutes that‚Äôs why don‚Äôt @ me
Heavy on strategically subbing out the greatest roster assembled. Subbing out Larry Bird for Scottie Pippen is a whole different level compared to subbing out Durant for Saddiq Bey or Jerami Grant lmao
Is saddiq bey really one of the best coaches ever?
Why did Saddiq Bey and Darius Garland play?
Deadass Saddiq Bey was their best &amp; most energetic defender when he came on I‚Äôm not even bein a homer
"Saddiq Bey looked better than some of the players that will be going to Tokyo. That is all I'm gonna say, though I will admit I like Saddiq Bey."
"Simply not enough Saddiq. Bey plays 40 min, this is an easy win."
Saddiq Bey
I‚Äôm just here for Keldon Johnson and Saddiq Bey
you cannot tell me Kevin Love is better than Saddiq Bey rn
Happy for saddiq bey!! He has lot of potential
Give Saddiq Bey his flowers
You're welcome for Saddiq Bey.
don't forget Saddiq Bey
"That isn't him being heavy footed that's him having a high, slow handle. OG has quick feet as we can see on defense, but his handle being not up to par really limits his quicks on offense. Look at OG moving off ball especially coming off screens and pin downs then him with the ball in his hand. He isn't like a Saddiq Bey who is a little slow with and without the ball, he clearly is being hampered cause of the lack of a strong handle. I also don't think he has much burst due to his handle which is why he's ball handling is limited to PnR off the wing rather than up top where burst is needed more to create seperation, off the catch or in the post.  Its in fans nature to want to big up their players, and it is true that he had improved from the below 30s he was shooting as a rookie and sophomore to his slightly below average 35.9%, but I expected a regression of sorts because that season was an outlier from his previous season in terms of percentage and volume.  Did I say he is worth it? I said any player who was a second option on a championship team is getting a max. I also said he is a valuable player who is not a very good but a legit elite defender as well as showing improvement as a ball handler and playmaker in spite of his regression as a shooter. Even with that regression he has put up a comparable but slightly lower PPG and efficiency (per100 from 30.9 points to 28.9, 55.4 TS to 54.7%). Is he worth the max right now based on this season? No. Would any player who was in the position Siakam was putting up what he put up doing what he did going into free agency after a championship they'd get the max as well. I actually was against extending Siakam for the max as we could have just waited for his RFA and if he gets a max offer from another team then we match it, if not we offer him a cheaper deal.  &gt; If OG shoots under 35% from three this next year you can take the 3 out of 3-d and that contract starts looking like ass.  A career 37.5% shooter who has shot two seasons in a row at and above 39% isn't regressing to under 35%. OG isn't Nick Anderson, you're teaching super hard right now my guy. He isn't a Siakam where he had one true decent shooting season, he has a track record of being a great shooter.  Any player can regress, but acting like OG going from 39.7% this season, 39.0% last year and 37.5% for his career to below 35% is a longer reach than OG, Giannis and Jonathon Isaac wingspans. At this point it is absolutely a team friendly deal even if he regresses to his career average of 37.5% let alone staying steady at this season's production. Derrick White putting up 15/3/3 shooting 41/35/85 got 4 years 70M, the difference between White and OG as players and assets isn't so small that 2M makes it up. If OG went to RFA, he is getting more than 72M easy."
"I mean, Saddiq Bey and Jerami Grant was a cute story but that team truly sucked shit and they had a winning percentage of .277 for a reason. There was not a lot of reason to be optimistic there, but Cade completely changes that."
So what you‚Äôre saying is that Saddiq Bey is Klay 2.0
I got Terry around the sixth too. We had mini awards too so I won another $20 for best trade (I traded Saddiq Bey and De'Andre Hunter (IL) for Draymond Green right before he had like 20 triple doubles) and $10 for best pick for Scary Terry
"The two Pistons all-rookies, Bey and Stewart, will go on to have great careers in this league. Especially now that they‚Äôre playing with Cade; Stew the perfect roll &amp; picknpop man and Saddiq the sniper"
McDaniels has a lot of potential. Saddiq Bey too
"Saddiq Bey. No Homer either. He‚Äôs going to be a 20 ppg scorer easily at some point. Has one of the best three balls in the league. Also, has defensive potential.   Other two picks are Poku and Isaiah Stewart. Jaden McDaniels could interesting down the road too.   Last year‚Äôs draft was good man.  Don‚Äôt feel slighted if I didn‚Äôt list your rookie here. I like Quickley, Maxey, Hampton too. Just a deep all around class."
"Best career? I‚Äôd say saddiq bey just based off his playstyle and build. 3&amp;D wings are the most desired players in this league outside of stars. Add to that him potentially playing with 2 guys who I think will be good to great playmakers and pressure relievers in Cade and Killian, Bey might just waltz his way to being on a Perennial playoff team and a 9 figures in career earnings."
"Desmond Bane will start on good playoff teams for years, Saddiq Bey as well. I have confidence Maxey can be borderline all star level one day, but it will depend on his development as a shooter and passer. kid‚Äôs got that ‚Äúit‚Äù factor and competes on defense too   Theo Maledon is one to watch also"
Saddiq Bey or Desmond Bane will have the longest careers
"you actually created a post to respond to people to justify this horrible signing?  he averaged 20 minutes a game in the regular season, 8 pts / 2.5 rebounds  thats a minimum level player not 13M and sure as hell not 14.8M - not factoring incentives bc he sucks  Pistons took Saddiq Bey with the draft pick the Clippers traded.  Bey played 27 min a game - so 7 more minutes and averaged 12 / 5 as a ROOKIE  Bey makes 2.6M, Kennard makes 12.7M  Exactly 10M difference - Clippers just didnt have any faith in their drafting which is weird because i thought Jerry West was working for you guys but maybe im wrong  That 10M instantly could have been used for another player via trade etc  Kennard was a huge bust - he came on the last few games in the playoffs after Kawhi went down but has been a bust  Slow, weak, foul prone, injury prone are his trademarks - good shooting at the 3pt is his only positive.  Pistons fan here that saw him showcased in Detroit his last season and even then he barely put up 15 points on one of the worst teams in the league lol  You guys got swindled"
"As a Pistons fan, I hate being in the fringe and it's in the purgatory. We've been in it for years. This season is the first season that the Pistons actually committed to rebuilding and they got rewarded for the #1 overall pick (Cade). The future suddenly looks great for the Pistons with Saddiq Bey and Beef Stew plus the emergence of Jeremi Grant on the roster."
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don‚Äôt have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn‚Äôt in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we‚Äôd be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it‚Äôd also depend on who else is taken. I don‚Äôt believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"I think he should be excited.  Pistons sucked this year obviously.  But, Grant was awesome and still relatively young. Saddiq Bey looks good.  Hayes looks good.  I think Casey is a good coach.  I think it‚Äôs a good fit.  Even if he doesn‚Äôt hit the playoffs in years 1-2"
"&gt; Tbf Saddiq Bey looks way better than your typical #19 pick  actually not as it turns out lmfao. 19 is the most loaded non lotto pick spot this decade somehow. Huerter, Collins, Tobias and Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley all 19th overall lmao.  Bey is a gem though, Detroit has a bright future."
"Tbf Saddiq Bey looks way better than your typical #19 pick. He‚Äôs gonna be a solid 3 and D guy for his whole career, those players don‚Äôt come cheap especially when they‚Äôre on a rookie deal"
"Kings tried shopping him at the deadline, they offered him to the Pistons for Saddiq Bey and the Pistons rejected it lol  If Bagley can‚Äôt even be traded for a #19 pick rookie idk wtf his trade value is"
That‚Äôs tru tbh. While I think saddiq bey would develop nicely into that model 3/D guy it ofc Jerami Grant and Cade is deadly
Saddiq Bey is absolutely starter material already. I guarantee the Nets are kicking themselves for that three team trade where they got Shamet and we got the 19th pick and used it on Bey.
lol Kings offered him to the Pistons for Saddiq Bey and the Pistons declined
"Bruh from no2 overall pick to being rejected on a Saddiq Bey trade, that's all you need to know about this guy."
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."
"Not sure about Cade, who hasn't played an NBA game yet, or Hayes, who was injured for most of his rookie year.   However, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart have already established their roles and skillsets.   Bey was one of the best sharpshooters in that class, shooting 38% on 6 attempts per game. In fact, he made more 3s his rookie year than anyone else in his class period. With improvements on the defensive end, he will be a 3 and D wing ala Klay Thompson or Joe Harris. Even without D, Kyle Korver managed to have a fruitful 17 season career and was even an All Star.   Stewart was the best center in the class, full stop. He was easily the best rim protector in the entire class and he had a clean scoring touch around the rim and even the ability to pop the 3 every now and again. There is a reason Pistons fans are trying to get him to meet with Ben Wallace because he's Ben Wallace but with the ability to score."
"Pistons are in year one of a rebuild. Sure they have been bad but they just got a new GM/Front office last season. They shredded almost the whole roster and aren‚Äôt locked into any long term deals/bad contracts once Blakes money comes off. This whole narrative that Cade is going to a bad situation is so dumb, people just don‚Äôt pay attention. Pistons have Saddiq Bey first all rookie with Isiah stewart second team all rookie, not to mention a lot of people have written Killian off as a bust after only play less than half the season but the kid is only 19 and has a ton of potential. They have Jeremi Grant signed to a reasonable contract. NBA should be ecstatic that another franchise might be on the rise to be competitive. This is good for the nba and nba fans. Stop reading into some weird narrative that only super stars should play in big markets."
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
"Stop thinking in positions and think in roles. Hayes at the point for now, saddiq bey Cunningham and grant are wings. Stewart and plumlee are bigs."
"Obviously a reactionary take, but I was thinking this morning that if the Pistons had Haliburton instead of Hayes then they'd be beyond set.  Haliburton/Cade/Saddiq Bey/Jerami Grant/Isiah Stewart - that's a ridiculous small ball lineup."
"Not a lot of room for an undersized PG on a contending team in the west, especially with Jalen Brunson was a fringe 6MOY candidate.  That being said, wasn't it rumored that Harambob forced you all to draft Josh Green over Saddiq Bey? Oof."
Saddiq Bey dad dicked your team. Surely you could name him.
"Obviously a reactionary take, but I was thinking this morning that if the Pistons had Haliburton instead of Hayes then they'd be beyond set.  Haliburton/Cade/Saddiq Bey/Jerami Grant/Isiah Stewart - that's a ridiculous small ball lineup."
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."
"Plus Saddiq Bey made all rookie first and Beef Stew made second. It‚Äôs a bright future for the Pistons. With how well our rookies played at the end of the season, Cade will just be the cherry on top to hopefully start building a strong playoff team."
"Yo, the Pistons actually have some solid pieces in place to build around a top pick, especially Cade. Killian Hayes is a high potential rookie guard, Jeremi Grant can provide a leadership role and keep games competitive, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart were 1st and 2nd All-Rookie team this year."
Saddiq Bey deserves help
Are the rockets really better than the pistons right now? Pistons also have saddiq bey and Stewart to surround cade with and another playmaker in killian hayes so cade doesn‚Äôt have to handle all playmaking
Saddiq Bey is nice
"Detroit? Wut  I mean Saddiq Bey is nice, Isaiah Stewart looks like he could develop into a good big man but I see fairly little else for optimism. Killian Hayes was injured for a lot of the season, not gonna judge him yet.  Orlando is fucking cursed with injuries lmao. Rockets' future will depend a lot on how the Nets picks they received in the Harden trade pans out.  And you really wanna disrespect the Hawks after what they did this season with one of the youngest rosters in the league?"
I don‚Äôt wanna talk about either of them especially JRich. Green has potential tho I‚Äôll give him that but Saddiq Bey was right there.
Saddiq Bey in the future
Detroit drafted Saddiq Bey at 19 and I think that Bey is way more valuable than Moses. Precious hasn't been any good but you can get good players in that range
"In sum:  Sometime 2018, Cuban hired Bob to be his analytics director. Bob has a background in poker and NBA gambling (developing programs that beat the odds). He made a few millions on it and intrigued Cuban enough to be hired (Bob is also a semi regular guest on Bill Simmons podcasts).  Donnie the GM has been the GM for over 2 decades, overseeing the Mavs success from the early 2000s and peaking in 2011 with the Dirk+good vets lineup. Since then, he has made hit and miss decisions (hits include Monta, and later Luka) and misses (almost everything else since 2011). Still, he oversaw one of the most successful NBA teams of the past 2 decades.  So Bob comes in and starts having a say in Donnie's decisions, cause Mark listens to analytics guys more and more (and crypto-bro - hurrah!). This includes picking Josh Green over Saddiq Bey for example. Identifying Seth as an FA target. And some other decisions that didn't pan out (Delon Wright). This likely started the power struggle between him and Donnie.   Donnie starts fighting back, because it appears his job is on the line, given the rapid ascent of Luka and increased pressure to build a contender around the 22 year old. He likely supplies Tim Cato, reporter, with info on a hit piece vs Bob.  Bob on the other hand sees an opening in Donnie's tenure and does a reddit video that's kinda hilarious in retrospect, showing off Donnie's GM ""Masterclass"" since 2011. So it's a back and forth game.  Donnie loses, unfortunately. Reports suggest the decision to let him go was made before the hit piece on Bob, and many Mavs fans have wanted a change in the front office for quite some time.  Rick has been with Donnie for 13 years, and they go way back. He likely saw the writing on the wall and decided to leave on his own, knowing he was next if they didn't do better next season. He also does not completely jive with Luka, though I'd argue it's a healthy relationship - Luka needs someone to challenge him, otherwise he'll turn into LuGM.  As for Luka. He loves Donnie. Hit and miss with Rick. And supposedly hates Bob. Part of the friction with Rick is apparently the way Bob is able to overrule Rick on some coaching decisions (I suppose lineups?).   Anyway, end of the day... we'll see what happens. I hate that it came to this, but who knows if this will prove better in the long run?"
Pistons legend Saddiq Bey
No bias but Saddiq Bey is gonna be great
Saddiq Bey gonna average 20
brooks in detroit? omg i need that. i like saddiq bey but i‚Äôd rather have brooks.
"I didn‚Äôt think he was very impressive in those playoffs, and he went infront of people like Halliburton, saddiq bey, and maxey, just to name a few. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be bad but I don‚Äôt think he should‚Äôve went that high"
"Detroit rookies were playing great for their draft pick number. Saddiq Bey as the 19th pick had the same amount of triples per game as Luka and Lillard in their rookie years with better percentage and more attempts (crazy when the season was shorter). And Isaiah Stewart as the 16th pick was the rookie who had more rebounds and blocks and it's not even close - Stew had 86 blocks, while Jaden McDaniels had 60 as the second rookie with most blocks; and he had 453 rebounds while the second best rebounder Jae'Sean Tate had 374.  Not knowing these guys doesn't make you a casual, but you're definitely not invested on how the rookies are doing. It's not even your fault because regarding rookies the media only cared about Lamelo and don't give a shit about Detroit."
Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
"For  Bulls it could have been SGA, mitchell,Siakam, Patrick williams and Pj washington For Magic  Sabonis, Mitchell, SGA, Brandon clarke N saddiq bey"

Not the most exciting but I bet threes for a rookie record is broken. Saddiq Bey was on pace to break it if there would have been a 82 game season.

"Flawless? Saddiq Bey got you hyped? The luck of getting the 1st pick was a bailout. The rebuild was going abysmally to be honest.

In the summer league you are still playing against former NBA players like Kenneth Faried, beasley, Mudiay etc, and second year players like immanuel quickley saddiq bey etc, so you are playing against NBA competition and it is NBA rules with 24 seconds on the shot clock and same type of referees, so it is def way more similar then a pointless pro am game with scrubs... as a 3rd string pg with schroder and Marcus smart starting over him he doesn‚Äôt have many errors to make and if I were him I‚Äôd be trying to play against the best competition possible, summer league is only like a week long then he has the rest of the offseason to do pro am, and there wasn‚Äôt a summer league last year either  Also to answer u when U said ‚Äúso he can let other players below shine‚Äù why would he want a point guard below him shine and possibly get the coaches eye and take his spot? U don‚Äôt make any sense at all"
"Saddiq bey,  Desmond Bane"
Buddy plus Bagley for Saddiq Bey and Blake Griffin salary?
"Tyrese Maxey, Saddiq Bey, already been said but Immanuel Quickley"
I've seen a lot of doubles in the summer league so far actually. Its kinda weird. The Thunder doubled Saddiq Bey and Cade Cunningham a lot
Carmelo Anthony (always felt like his name sounded like butter)   Deni Avdija   Saddiq Bey  Facundo Campazzo  Ricky Rubio
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"1A &amp; 1B are for Cade &amp; Killian. Not for Lee, and not for Joseph.  I just don't see how the team would bench Frank Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Saddiq Bey and others to give ""a lot"" of run to Joseph in 3 guard lineups."
"And I honestly believe a lot of people posting here literally did not watch the game.  The Pistons rolled out lineups with 3-4 non-shooters around Cade. This won't happen in the regular season when he has Frank Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant &amp; Kelly Olynyk.   A guy like Cade thrives when he has guys around him who can hit shots, and when there is a real system to run.   Summer League fails to provide both of those aspects."
"&gt;Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF  I don't think you will see a ""lot"" of that.  Casey and the front office have stressed how important shooting is this year. For that reason, Frank Jackson &amp; Saddiq Bey will be playing a lot of SG/SF.  Also, if we re-sign Hamidou Diallo (which I expect), there is another guy who will be playing at the SF spot."
Still so confused how Saddiq Bey got 1st team rookie over Quick
Hahaha so Saddiq Bey is a scrub or??? Man this is hilarious
Saddiq Bey is nice
Saddiq Bey and Doumbuya   Two meaty guys who don‚Äôt miss
Man Saddiq Bey is Lebron
Saddiq Bey is massive
Saddiq Bey is scary man
Why is Saddiq Bey playing Summer League?
"I love Desmond Bane, but there are a few rookies that do not need SL, him and guys like Saddiq Bey are guys that already looked NBA ready out the gate and I don't expect them to play the whole SL."
"I liked his shot, I liked his NBA body, I liked his blocking out and rebounding positioning, I liked his defense and most importantly I liked his confidence in himself speaking of Saddiq Bey."
"After 1 game, casuals always over analyze. He was deferring too much to guys like Saddiq Bey. He should put them in their place even as a rookie considering they won‚Äôt be at his level no matter how hard they work."
"Well, he'll be playing with solid young Center Beef Stew, borderline allstar and gold medalist Jerami Grant, Saddiq ""Young Buddy"" Bey and Killian Hayes. I think his assist numbers will be fine."
Pretty sure he‚Äôs talking about Saddiq Bey homie
My main takeaway from this game is that Saddiq Bey can flat out ball
We really traded Saddiq Bey for a year of Landry Shamet
&gt; Told you he is a 6'8 Jalen Rose.  Dawg he's literally shorter than 6'7 Saddiq bey
"Nope Detroit has 7   Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Jerami Grant, Sekou Doumbouya, Saben Lee, and Isaiah Stewart."
"""Cade Cunningham out for season after breaking hand in Pistons brawl which also ends seasons of Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey &amp; Isaiah Stewart."""
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
"It was after his rookie year when he was getting compared to LeBron. He had plenty of pull then. I think moving Brown, or possibly Terry could be possible, but don‚Äôt see any scenario where they would move Green, especially after the internal fight to take him over Saddiq Bey."
Jalen Brunson was on the Villanova team that one 2 chips recently. Mavs squandered an opportunity to get Saddiq Bey and strengthen the culture in that way. There‚Äôs a lot of Villanova alumni in the league rn I‚Äôd want on this team. And obviously the strategy they use every year for free agency sets them up to fail
"Saddiq Bey, hes slept on. I feel like he could develop into a Bonafide Star soon."
Isnt it a great feeling? We have a young group as well  PG: Cade Cunningham - 19  SG: Killian Hayes - 20  SF: Saddiq Bey - 22  PF: Jerami Grant - 27 (our old man in the lineup)  C: Isaiah Steward - 20  With some young dudes off the bench as well in Josh Jackson and Diallo
I can hear the ad now.  Come next Sunday for Saddiq Bey double dildo day!!!!
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
Ehh we tried him for a season and he wasn‚Äôt that good for us. We should have kept last years pick and drafted Saddiq Bey
Can you really call Saddiq bey an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù small forward?  I can name like 20-30 better than him.
Trading Luke Kennard for Saddiq Bey will go down as an all timer for us lol
"Best day since the goin to work Pistons. Not just because of Cade either. Because of Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Killian Hayes last year. Our young core could be special together."
PG-Killian Hayes SG- Cade Cunningham SF- Saddiq Bey PF- Jerami Grant C- Isaiah Stewart  the future is bright in Detroit they just need a better coach
Calling Saddiq Bey a bench player went he dropped 30 on you lmao
THEY ALREADY SADDIQ BEY. CADE IS A NO BRAINER
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."
"&gt; Either way, they weren‚Äôt going to re-sign either of them so why keep them when you could get a player you like in the draft?  Because getting back the 48th pick in the draft isnt an actual return worth anything. It's the type of deal no Pistons fan wouldve supported before it happened its all in hindsight that its rationalized away as ""of course it makes sense to do it"". Even spinning it as turning it into Saddiq Bey is again the same thing. If Det actually valued 2nd round picks they wouldnt have attached 4 of them to get rid of Kennard."
"They traded him for all rookie 1st team Saddiq Bey‚Ä¶   Well, really it was Luke Kennard and Brown for that pick but they had to get the Nets involved to dump Kennard‚Äôs expiring.   Either way, they weren‚Äôt going to re-sign either of them so why keep them when you could get a player you like in the draft?"
"Zeke Nnaji, and PJ obviously  Other teams - Patrick Williams, Malik Monk, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane"
It really sucks that last year's draft was kind of void of top-end talent. Okoro's a bit short for a wing and he has obvious shooting issues.  Looking back on the 2020 draft there wasn't a lot of wing depth and the wings that were in the top 10 (i.e. Okoro and Deni) had documented shooting issues. I personally would've taken Deni but whatever.  The solid wing shooters (Nesmith and Saddiq Bey) didn't project to be more than 3&amp;D role players either. Shit sucks.
Saddiq bey
"I'm not even sure what day Jalen Green worked out for us, because there was no public appearance or sighting of him downtown like with Cade. Cade's workout wasn't confirmed until after a picture of him with some fans outside of Comerica Park was going around Twitter and Reddit, and shortly after a team beat writer confirmed he had his workout with the team earlier that day, and would be attending the game with Troy Weaver, Coach Casey and Saddiq Bey, among others on the staff. If Coach Casey and Troy Weaver would have as much as taken Jalen Green out to dinner, we would have known, someone would have posted it."
We literally drafted Josh Green over Saddiq Bey.
"What players do the Rockets have that the Pistons even want? We already had Wood and we saw how that ended, KPJ we drafted and traded away on draft night, and he doesn't fit the high-character mold Weaver and Casey follow, plus he'd be redundant if we select Jalen Green in this trade down scenario, and Tate will be a 26 year old second year player when the season starts and is redundant with Saddiq Bey."
"They didn‚Äôt take Green to a Tigers game with Dwane Casey, Troy Weaver, and Saddiq Bey though lol"
"As a Detroit fan, pre draft, wed probably be talking Saddiq Bey. I‚Äôd say no way in hell! Maybe a team whose second best player is older?"
"Saddiq Bey changed the culture, respect"
Weird way to spell Saddiq Bey
i know who saddiq bey is. i guess i shoulda been more clear in saying he wouldn‚Äôt have had millions of social media followers and that type of thing in cleveland he just wouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúnobody‚Äù
nobody knows who the fuck Saddiq Bey is and he's all rookie first team in detroit
I view him a lot like I view Saddiq Bey   Aaron getting drafted to Detroit would be a pretty solid pickup for them in the 2nd
"I mean who are the #15 picks from the last 5 years? I can't name any until they make an impact (like Saddiq Bey, Giannis, etc.). Unlike Zion, RJ Barrett, and others who people know before they step on an NBA court."
Saddiq bey is a jokercel
I look forward to next year when Saddiq Bey dunks on a defender and says the Joker‚Äôs classic line ‚ÄúWHY ARE YOU BEING SO SERIOUS?‚Äù
"[Saddiq Bey, probably](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DX_wprkggoE)"
"Not sure how they calculate these, but Saddiq Bey being a project seems wrong. Feel he should at least be listed as a good prospect, if not up and comer. He came into the league and contributed from day 1, and was named to first team all rookie. Nearly broke the record for 3s by a rookie (was on pace to easily in an 82 game season), and played very solid defense on the wing. I think just about every team in the league would love to have a guy like him in their rotation."
PG: Malcom Brogdon (4)  SG: Luka Doncic (1)  SF: Saddiq Bey (3)  PF: Robert Covington (5)  C: Anthony Davis (2)  6: Gary Trent Jr. (6)  7: Mo Bamba (7)

Not as good as Saddiq Bey apparently
Isaiah Stewart &gt; Saddiq Bey
Lmao those late 2000‚Äôs early 2010‚Äôs pistons teams with Charlie V were so painful to watch. Watching washed up T-Mac with them was pretty fun but man they were so bad  Future is bright now though‚Ä¶ Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey and Cade are gonna turn some heads this season
Unless Cade somehow becomes Doncic and Saddiq Bey becomes Kawhi
"In retrospect, Saddiq Bey but yeah"
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
To not have to pay him. They wound up with Saddiq Bey in that trade even though it cost them the 4 2nds they got back in this deal.

"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario ≈†ariƒá and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanoviƒá and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn‚Äôt trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."

"I haven't seen a single accurate evaluation of sekou in this thread as well as most other threads. Hating on my own fan base right now but most pistons fans in general on reddit are awful talent evaluators and frequently run players out of town because of targeting players online.   Sekou has flashed his athleticism and shown he has offensive tools, but hasn't built any consistency due to covid and a full roster transformation. People act like he hasn't improved at all however he has improved his defense every year. If he hit a few more catch and shoot 3s pistons fans would act like we have another saddiq bey."
"Saddiq Bey. Had a stellar rookie season, made some records, had a Player of the Week honor..going to build on that."
"Hi there. I love how r/nba lets me read NBA news sorted by how big or relevant of news it is. I like reading comments that aren‚Äôt just twitter-reply nonsense. I like post-game threads to get more qualatative info about games that I didn‚Äôt catch, instead of just stats. The comments are typically great for that.   r/nba just makes me feel very connected to the NBA world. One thing I would like more of is detailed discussion of team/player performance and outlook.  I would rank the Pistons at the 29/30 slot. Probably 30. It‚Äôs been bad. We haven‚Äôt won a game. The shooting has been horrendous. Killian has been horrendous. Our offense is ranked dead last and the only team in the league averaging less than 100 points per game.   But this is a rebuild, and there are glimmers. The defense has been quite decent. Sophomores Saddiq Bey and Isiah Stewart have been the best players on the Pistons this year. And Cade debuting should help generate some offense. Patience is hard in sports, but it‚Äôs the virture we need to remember with this team.  I‚Äôm on r/nba a lot. A few hours a day for sure. I love staying connected to NBA news and discussion. I watch every Pistons game, and try to watch one or two games every weeknight. I consume a LOT of basketball.  If I‚Äôm not selected, I think u/x20mike07x would be great.

Saddiq Bey has more rebounds in 100 minutes than Joel Embiid has in 119 minutes.
PG duties?? Saddiq Bey?  I need to watch some Pistons games clearly
1st team all rookie Saddiq Bey. Averaged 12 ppg last season and shot 38% from three on six attempts per game. He set a ton of rookie shooting records  One of the few players that keeps me from having a mental breakdown when I watch the Pistons' offense
"He‚Äôs getting better on offense but that‚Äôs what was expected of him and he‚Äôs delivered in the defense. Also, look at those drafted after him. Is there really that many people we‚Äôd take over him if given the chance to redraft? Saddiq Bey? Isaiah Stewart? Tyrese Maxey? That‚Äôs about it, and they were all drafted way after our pick.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/isaac-okoro-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-offense-defense-analysis/"
I love my boys but the Pistons might be the worst offensive team in the league right now. Our three point shooting is horrendous and the only guy making any kind of consistent impact right now is Saddiq Bey. Killian has 2 points across 40 minutes and is without question the worst starting guard in the league at this moment. It‚Äôs questionable if he‚Äôd even make an impact in the G-League right now. Corey Joseph and Frank Jackson are not much better to round out our guard play. Our defense is solid but Cade is going to have a tremendous amount of pressure to reignite this offense when he finally plays.

Our defense is pretty good but holy shit is our offense bad. The only thing giving me life in our offense is Saddiq Bey
"Well trading Kennard was for the 19th pick, so Saddiq Bey‚Ä¶ no complaints from me lol"
"Exactly, i didn‚Äôt get it at all. At least have him struggle. Lavine is capable of taking games over all by himself, and that‚Äôs exactly what he did because Casey let him. So so strange. Grant, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, even Killian would‚Äôve done better.   Instead Casey had our best perimeter defender in Grant guard Patrick Williams all game, as if he‚Äôs any sort of offensive threat. Smh."
"Bulls fan but was impressed by some Pistons after this game:   **Jerami Grant**: WOW. This man needs to be considered a top-40 player. Detroit was starting a 2-way SG, had no Cade, and were struggling offensively until he picked up the slack. Solid rebounder, good mid-range, even a couple nice passes. Color me thoroughly impressed.    **Saddiq Bey**: looked like a bona fide starter. He used his size/strength with Beef Stew to bully the Bulls on the board. He kept exposing DeMar on D as well. Just overall impressed for a 22-yr old 2nd year player.    As a Bulls fan,  **Lavine**: Top-20 player and rising. Top-15 in my personal rankings.    **Caruso**: not a meme, immediately a top-3 defender on the Bulls   **Lonzo**: first real PG I‚Äôve seen on the Bulls since 2016. Our offense flows SO much better with a full-court initiator and all of these slashers. The Bulls just need consistent outside shooting and their offense makes a lot of sense."

"&gt; We aren‚Äôt gonna be good but we kept it close with what should be a solid Bulls team in a game where Lavine popped off.  Seeing the Pistons play tonight is an eye opener for me. And this is without Cade Cunningham. Saddiq Bey is a contributor already. And I would say a future all-star. He's not some rookie anymore.   Saddiq Bey and Jerami Grant are going to carry the team. And we haven't seen Cade play with them yet. Pistons are a shooting guard away from being a playoff contender IMO. I can only think of Eric Gordon being most likely available. But of course, Pistons can do better.   I am not sleeping on this team."
"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant. We will be exciting at times, but mostly sucktastic, until we get more players to space the floor."
"Cavs and Pistons. Two bad teams with nothing to gain so there‚Äôll be a whole lot of offense. Love some Saddiq Bey, I hope he breaks out this year."
"2011-2012 lineup: Brandon Knight, Rodney Stuckey, Tayshaun Prince, Jason Maxiell, Greg Monroe  2021-2022 lineup: Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart  One backcourt of the future vs. another backcourt of the future. All I know is I have a good feeling about Brandon Knight moving forward."
Only one i know of is when they tried trading Bagley for Saddiq Bey lmaooo
We got denied a Bagley-Saddiq Bey swap at the trade deadline. He's a $10M+ player so we'd probably have to attach an asset just to dump him. No one is going to give us an asset to absorb a $10M+ bust that's been injured for half of his career with signs of being a headcase.
"Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Beef Stew, Cade. Not biased or anything."
"1. Enlist Robert Williams to invent a time machine.  2. Go back to the 2019 draft,  pick Okeke instead of Langford, Keep Thybulle, and pick Keldon Johnson instead of Grant Williams.  In 2020 pick Saddiq Bey instead of Nesmith.  3. Travel back to the future and trade Okeke, Thybulle, Johnson and Bey along with a future 1st or two for Ayton."
"If you‚Äôre projecting, shouldn‚Äôt you projecting their outcomes and not what they are right now? Because Bey can create his own offence (step backs, post ups, fadeaways, blow bys to the rim) and you should project that to improve not be non-existent.   Bey projects as an NBA starter for the next decade, giving you 10-15ppg every year. What the hell does Josh Green project as?  People fall too in love with the unknown quantity. Green could be anything, he could even be Saddiq Bey"
I would take Josh Green over Saddiq Bey still.
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
"No way am I hearing this from a Piston‚Äôs fan lmao  (Saddiq Bey is nice tho, I wish we had him)"
A lot of us were pissed we took him instead of Saddiq Bey.
Saddiq Bey never had the rookie lead in 3 point shooting lol
"The big upset was Saddiq Bey. We thought he fell to us, but then we picked Green instead. I like Green though. Not a great offensive player, but he has potential."
"""Inject the Cade Cunningham/Killian Hayes/Saddiq Bey/Jerami Grant/Isaiah Stewart lineup into my veins""  Zach gets it."
"Cuban will never be more than a 5 until he stops having final say over personnel decisions. It was clear during their GM search this offseason that he was never going after someone like Masai who demands autonomy over roster moves. He created such a toxic front office structure that resulted in opposing GMs not knowing who had final say on trades within the organization. He let a shadow-GM who made his money as a gambler select Josh Green over Saddiq Bey in the 2020 draft, the last top 20 pick the Mavs will have in the Luka era. And none of this would have changed without the Tim Cato story - which Cuban called ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù before he totally cleaned house.  I‚Äôm not even going to get into the late Dirk prime years where we were constantly being embarrassed by the Dwight Howard/Deandre Jordan chases when we could have just re-signed Tyson Chandler. Chandler Parsons was our go to Free Agent recruiter.   He did a lot of good early on by focusing on international scouting, but I‚Äôm just over the facade of Mark Cuban as trailblazing owner."
I made the Pistons trade Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart to the Magic in 2K and they just left and re-signed back in Detroit the next offseason.
i'll never forgive bob for picking green over saddiq bey.
Saddiq bey is a year away from being an all star
"I know Embiid forced Kawhi to rainbow that shot, but part of me wonders if Ben's would have been able to stay closer on it if Embiid didn't basically get in his way.     An alternate timeline where we fire Brett and trade Ben for a huge haul to find the 3rd guy to go with Jimmy and Embiid is the one where we are true contenders for 4-5 years.   Wouldn't have even needed to trade for Tobi, which cost us 2 1sts(Saddiq Bey, Tre Mann) plus Shamet in that scenario.   add those extra picks to the war chest, plus Ben's return and it's like a process level amount of picks only you have two of the top 15 guys in the league locked in long term to start with."
"Many players shoot 50% from 2. I‚Äôll use the lineup for the Pistons which were the worst team in the league last year.  Mason Plumlee: 63% 2pt / 0% 3pt  Jerami Grant: 47% 2pt / 35% 3pt  Saddiq Bey: 45% 2pt / 38% 3pt  Wayne Ellington: 52% 2pt/ 42% 3pt  Delon Wright: 52% 2pt/ 35% 3pt  Josh Jackson: 49% 2pt/ 30% 3pt  From the Pistons, we see that half the starting lineup shot 50% for 2 pointers. When you factor in drawing fouls, 50% 2 pointers is worth more than 33% 3 pointers as well."
I'll take Saddiq Bey instead.
"Imagine Simmons with Cade Cunningham, Jemari Grant, and Saddiq Bey."
"Everyone sleeping on the pistons. Dude admitted he doesn‚Äôt know shit about them, Saddiq bey and Isaiah Stewart will be beasts next year"
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
For Mavs:  * 2016: AJ Hammon -&gt; Jake Layman (46 -&gt; 47) * 2017: Dennis Smith Jr. -&gt; Zach Collins (9 -&gt; 10) * 2018: Trae Young -&gt; Mo Bamba (5 -&gt; 6) * 2019: Deividas Sirvydis -&gt; Daniel Gafford (37 -&gt; 38) * 2020: Josh Green -&gt; Saddiq Bey (18 -&gt; 19)
Saddiq Bey will one day be the best 3nD player in the league
Saddiq Bey midrange shots should be illegal.
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
"Trading our Saddiq Bey pick for Landry Shamet. Oh my God, I love Marks, but he completely screwed up there. I know he beats himself up to this day about it."
"Also a slew of quality role players.  Deni, Patrick Williams, Maxey, Saddiq Bey, Bane, Beef Stew, Jaden McDaniels, Okoro, Cole Anthony etc.... it was an above draft at the end of the day."

The existence of Saddiq Bey
"If there was no Killian Hayes, I think Saddiq Bey would be interesting"
"Yeah I heard it, and I also heard his interview the other day with Simmons where he tried to defend the pick and took a shot at saddiq bey. He doesn‚Äôt take blame for much, but does try to take credit for a lot"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
I'm just here to add Saddiq Bey to the list of guys who obviously shouldve made this list over people like THT
"Saddiq Bey, he will just be one of those nearly 20 year long career 3 and D guys that teams always want."
"Here‚Äôs a count of people who have been called potential  all stars in this thread: Duarte, Cole Anthony, Tyler Herro, Malik Bridges, Halliburton, Eric Paschall, Saddiq Bey, Cade Cunningham, Mattisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane."
Saddiq bey
Saddiq Bey
"I was Saddiq Bey All Day leading up to the draft, but we traded our pick for RoCo.  I honestly haven't compared their production enough to know which would've been the more big brain pickup."
Saddiq Bey easy 3&amp;D for the next 10 years
"I swear man, they did the same shit with Saddiq Bey and this year Herb Jones. FO‚Äôs are so dumb."
"giannis was almost all potential when he was drafted.  there's at least one saddiq bey in every draft.  teams that are at least 2-3 years from competing for a playoff spot don't need to stockpile saddiq bey's- they need to find their own giannis so when they do compete, it's for a top seed and not a 6th seed."
Getting locked up by Saddiq Bey &amp; Cade Cunningham
Was he tho. Saddiq Bey was right there (not that i‚Äôm complaining)
Saddiq Bey  Lot of it is being asked to do a lot more as a sophomore. He‚Äôll get back to it eventually so I‚Äôm not worried given we‚Äôre bad as a whole
Trading away Saddiq Bey would be idiotic when we could just sign Sexton in FA without trading part of our core
Do a three way trade and get Saddiq Bey and Harrison Barnes.
"From what I know definitely not, for a few reasons:  - Pistons organization views Jerami Grant as a centrepiece - rejected three first round picks last deadline  - Pistons also view Saddiq Bey as a centrepiece, calling him part of the ‚ÄúCore 4‚Äù  - Pistons can‚Äôt trade any firsts as its currently owed to OKC  - Theyre trying to tank this year, and they‚Äôre angling to free up cap space for 2023/2024 off-seasons  - Organization keeps speaking about ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù and how talent doesn‚Äôt matter if their character isn‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for   - Theyre building around Cade Cunningham as the franchise star   But I‚Äôll say, Weaver hasn‚Äôt been afraid to make moves (traded literally everyone on the roster, Killian‚Äôs the longest tenured Piston) and he loves taking chances on highly drafted players that need fresh starts (Okafor, Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, Dennis Smith Jr, rumors of Bagley).   He also makes calls to every team about everything so even if this ‚Äúinterest‚Äù was true he was prolly doing due diligence."
"Given that i dont know who Saddiq Bey is and we played the Piston a week ago, NO."
" &gt; Saddiq has been pretty good despite his shot not falling, especially on defense...  Gotta disagree here, Bey gets lost way too often on D. Like he's strong as hell so he's a good body to put on someone but his team defense has been pretty bad so far this year"
Saddiq Bey must be blind to not see Corey Joseph there
I guess Saddiq Bey is pennies
Ben Simmons + Shake Milton = Pistons   Kelly Olynyk + Harrison Barnes + Saddiq Bey = 76ers  Jerami Grant = Kings
"Here's the breakdown of the Grant rumor from the article:  &gt;League sources have said the team is having ongoing discussions with the Detroit Pistons to acquire Grant, another forward, a young player, and a draft pick in exchange for Simmons. One source said power forward/center Kelly Olynyk and second-year swingman Saddiq Bey were mentioned as players who could be included in a possible deal. However, a source said the Pistons are unlikely to include Bey, a Villanova product, or Olynyk.  &gt;A person close to the Sixers said the team would want a more high-profile player than Grant in exchange for Simmons. The source added that the team hasn‚Äôt spoken to the Pistons lately.  &gt;But multiple sources said they have, and that the discussions were centered around Grant. The Athletic reported Thursday the Sixers have a list of 30 players they‚Äôd accept in a Simmons trade."
Like Saddiq Bey?  I was positive the Mavericks would pick him and then scratched my head at Josh Green.

"Bane is certainly in the convo as is Saddiq Bey off the top of my head who I think is just in a slump. Given Maxey is two years younger than Bane and nearly 2 younger than Bey I'd give him the edge in projecting to the future. I think that reasoning is valid to have Maxey 5th, but then again I'm bias. I don't think it's crazy to have someone else tho"
"If we drafted Saddiq Bey over Josh Green I‚Äôd feel so much better about the direction of this team right now, even if that doesn‚Äôt really fix the ball handling problem."
Yeah Saddiq Bey was all rookie first team and didn‚Äôt get invited

Maybe the Kings are just asking for too much. I wouldn't trade Saddiq Bey for Bagley either lol
"They are trying to trade him, it's that no one wants him. Last season Kings offered Bagley for Saddiq Bey and Detroit turned them down."
Saddiq Bey is a possibility as well.
"Right now I'd say LaMelo, Edwards, Cole Anthony, Haliburton, and Saddiq Bey are better. I'm also buying all the Wiseman stock still, he wasn't up to expectations but wasn't as bad as people think he was. We haven't seen him yet this year and Maxey has taken a leap so Maxey ahead of him but long term I think I'd take Wiseman"
I would‚Äôve never expected Hayes to be the guy shooting above average from three   Saddiq Bey has looked rough to start the season but he prolly picks it up  Olynyk and Grant are also in a slump
Better than Saddiq Bey???  But fr tho Harden‚Äôs 3 pt shooting start is really good. This game will have him crack 40% on like 8 attempts
Harden had Saddiq Bey over 10.5 points
Lol I‚Äôm still pissed we traded Saddiq Bey
All they had to do was draft Saddiq Bey or Bane and run it back. Mavs lost because KP was injured and Maxi was shooting 10% from three.
other than Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant (and occasionally Saddiq Bey and Kelly Olynyk) they don't have anyone else on the team with a scorer's mentality
"Pistons fan here:     ""Big Diq Bey""     Saddiq Bey"
"Our top scorer is Jerami Grant, and second is Saddiq Bey. Tf you talkin bout"
Saddiq Bey and Isiah Stewart both played well last year.
"But him, Saddiq Bey, and Kelly O combine to make the 1 good player on our entire roster so far this season"
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
Damn Saddiq Bey was Drafted Last Year. He been hoopin this yearüíØ
"Normally I hate these kinds of comments, because they're like ""LOL x team took y player over Kawhi!!?!?""  ...but this one? Yeah, this definitely seemed to be the consensus pick. Along with several others like Vassell, Kira Lewis, Cole Anthony, Saddiq Bey...  The only defense going for this (and the reason why I've defended Jalen Smith so much) is the Cam Johnson pick that worked out so well. I nearly threw my hat in the trash when I saw his name come up in the draft and told myself that I won't be so quick to judge moving forward -- if this becomes a pattern though, then we'll have to see."
And Saddiq Bey. And Isaiah Stewart.

"Nice list OP!  While not current NBA players, I found this interesting.  Only 10 players in the NBA played in high school in Maine.  All 10 were from the same high school, Maine Central Institute.  Sam Cassell, Caron Butler, Cutino Mobley, and Brad Miller came from that high school.  Since others asked, here's current players who played high school ball in D.C. (in alphabetical order):  Saddiq Bey  Luka Garza  Josh Hart  Jamorko Pickett"
Saddiq Bey will be an all star
Saddiq Bey is such a cool name
Saddiq Bey averaging 17 and 9 on 42/32/69 splits.   His shooting has been down but that should go up
