It’s-it’s not called Southern Carolina...just South Carolina. I love him tho. He was so good here and I hope he becomes really solid. Same with PJ Dozier
Jamychal Green has been covering for Jerami's defense and PJ Dozier for Craig's. Defense wasn't a problem in past 10 games until last night. I have a feeling it was fatigue related.
"lmao alright. It's literally every 30 minutes, someone posts a thread about how Luka is overrated because we are 8-10, like we aren't dealing with injuries/COVID.  Have fun if your team ever gets COVID and Murray/Millsap/Porter etc... are all out for weeks, and instead of having any sort of rational thought, redditers just think your team sucks and that Nikola Jokic is horrible because he isn't winning more games with Vlatko Cancar, Monte Morris, Isaiah Hartenstein, and PJ Dozier as his starters."
No more clutch time minutes for PJ Dozier
PJ Dozier why?
Celtics Legends PJ Dozier and Abdel Nader
"You have to look beyond the record. Jokic has been utterly dominant, just as much as Embiid has been while also literally running the offense and setting up his teammates - dude leads the league in assists, as a center. He's 4th in the NBA in steals. Leads the league in PER, and is at or near the top in BPM, DRPM, TPA, etc. He's scored or assisted on 42% of the Nuggets made baskets this year, which is the highest percent in the NBA (next closest is Luka at 40%, and PG and Embiid are closer to like 25% each respectively since people are mentioning them). And honestly he's doing this with teammates that mostly have been subpar so far.  What I mean partly - the Nuggets have been incomplete the whole year. Murray hurt his elbow in the 3rd game and hasnt really be right since, missed one game but he's still bothered by it. JaMychal Green missed the first four games, and MPJ missed the last 10, so the Nuggets depth/size at forward has been quite bad mostly. Monte Morris has been steady as always, PJ Dozier is ok, defends well, JaMychal Green has been solid as a backup 4... but Gary Harris is still one of the worst shooters in the NBA, and Will Barton has been wildly up and down (and REALLY cant finish at the rim). Paul Millsap is incapable of finishing in the paint anymore, for the most part. Like, Jokic's teammates have really not been very good, and he still is just dominant (to add a bit more evidence, only 3 Nuggets have a positive net rating when playing without Jokic - Murray, Monte Morris, and PJ Dozier). It's not a stretch to say that Jokic is quite literally the only thing separating the Nuggets from being average right now in record (with the 5th best net rating in the NBA mind you), and being utterly awful, like worst team in the NBA. With him on the floor the Nuggets offensive rating is 120. With him off, it's 97 which is historically bad (and also the largest difference in offensive on-off rating in the NBA by a HUGE margin). If all that doesn't make someone an MVP candidate I dunno what does."
It blows my mind how the nuggets bench comes out and I only know who pj dozier is and that’s only cause he was on the thunder haha
"The front office fucked up so bad. It makes no sense why we didn't sign or trade for any wings. Torrey Craig was in closing lineups in the playoffs and wanted to re-sign, yet the front office didn't offer him anything and he signed with the bucks for the minimum.  We play 4 Guard lineups sometimes nd our only competent 'wing' defenders are Garry Harris who is too small, Barton who is braindead sometimes and is about 50lbs too light, PJ Dozier who is actually ok and MPJ who sucks on defence"
"Ik, in fact I do. But I was watching before the Nuggets-Warriors game play by play, and noticed the good impact (or at least imo) of PJ Dozier on the Nuggets defense. Does that translates in a certain way on the stat sheet?"
Sin got a start last night and PJ dozier been getting minutes too.
"but he's clearly not a terrible defender either who will single-handedly tank your defense unless you put the all-defense first team around him. it's not like Nuggets defense gets so much better when you take Jokic off the floor.   there's a difference between ""perfect roster"" and ""optimal roster"". Denver's best perimeter defenders are what, Gary Harris, 35 year old Millsap and PJ Dozier? someone fill me in if i'm forgetting anyone. that's so far off of ""optimal"".   i'm not saying you have to get Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons and Giannis to make that defense work. just don't put him out there with MPJ's and 5'10 point guards you brought in from Europe for some reason."
Having PJ Dozier out there trying to shoot everytime aint gonna help. He sucks
PJ Dozier defensive stopper was certainly an experience.
"Jokic is making things easy on his teammates, but he can't play a full game and when he's off the court the offense is just way different.      Our bench to start the year was straight up atrocious. Any lead the starters built was gone within five minutes of them sitting. Malone is a coach who likes hockey shifts, but he's had to switch to staggering Jokic and Murray with the bench. Also, Jokic is kind of to blame for some of this, because he's gotten into early foul trouble in most games this season.      As far as defense goes, it was historically bad to start the season, and a lot of it has to do not only with losing Craig and Grant, but our front office's infatuation with point guards. Malone has frequently rolled out four point guard lineups with PJ Dozier at power forward. Those lineups get destroyed on the glass.      JaMychal Graeen coming back has really helped slowly turn around both the bench and our defense, but we also haven't beat a legitimately good team all year so I'm holding my breath as far as that ""fix"" is concerned.      MPJ being out doesn't help, but IMO his absence is pretty far down the list of things to worry about right now.      There are signs things are turning around, but who knows."
"&gt;Find me one contender that can win with literally 1 starter (by far the weakest link) and a bunch of G league players. All with only 2 subs.  Nuggets did that last season (January 31, 2020) on the second night of a back-to-back on the road against a fully healthy Milwaukee.  That was actually the biggest game in bringing PJ Dozier out of the G-league and into the regular lineup.  Technically we had 2 starters available (Barton and Jokic), but the rest of your description matches.  I agree this comment is stupid though - 76ers are without question a contender this year, and last night was meaningless for you guys.  Not sure why you think this was an indictment of the Nuggets though.  Uncalled fouls aren't our fault. Every team fouls, and if the refs don't call it that sucks.  That's not the fouling team's fault until a team is capable of coming out and getting 0 fouls. Until then, foul calls are exclusively on the refs."
"I'm just wondering what the hell is going on w/ the Nuggets? Jokic's insane play should be making the game easier for his teammates. I guess MPJ being in COVID protocol forever b/c he refuses to quarantine properly, plus Will Barton thinking he's the shit, and Gary Harris losing his shooting will do that to you. Millsap's still pretty good but old af. And losing longbois Craig and Grant didn't seem to help.  Hopefully Monte Morris and PJ Dozier take a huge leap this year. I'd really like Jokic to win MVP this season, or at least come in 2nd."
"They also had all the following calls:   They said pj Dozier was JaMychel green  They said green was monte Morris  The called him montee the entire game  They twice said Gary Davis  Will barone was a person  The said mpj was out injured  They said nuggets bench missed MPJ, who is a starter who rarely plays with the bench this year.   Your dudes just sucked at their job today. It's ok to admit that"
"He said Walton was the best passer because he win a championship. Walton himself thinks jokic is a better passer, and a championship has nothing to do with passing.  They also had all the following calls:   They said pj Dozier was JaMychel green  They said green was monte Morris  The called him montee the entire game  They twice said Gary Davis  Will barone was a person  The said mpj was out injured  They said nuggets bench missed MPJ, who is a starter who rarely plays with the bench this year.   Your dudes just sucked at their job today. It's ok to admit that"
"I mean they also were terrible at like... knowing anything that was happening.   The said pj Dozier was green  They said green was monte Morris  The called him montee the entire game  They twice said Gary Davis  Will barone was a person  The said mpj was out injured  They said nuggets bench missed MPJ, who is a starter who rarely plays with the bench this year.   They said Jokic passing wasn't looking as heralded as they thought as he had 12 assists.  BUT they did nail the pronunciation on Hartenstein lol.   They were just clueless out there"
"Called PJ Dozier Jamychal Green, Monty Morris instead of Monte, Will Borson?, said our bench is missing MPJ(who is our starter) due to injury(out for covid protocol, not injured), and said Bill Walton is the best passing big of all time because he's a winner. Just a rough game to listen to."
"LOL. Also Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Patterson  Now that most players from past OKC teams Wiggins played against have dispersed across the league, I hope he thinks he's playing against OKC every time he sees a former OKC player on the opposing team:  * Blazers (Melo, Kanter) - current split 1-1  * Pistons (Grant) - 1-0 so far (do we play Eastern conference teams 1 more time in 2nd half of season?)  * Kings (Corey Brewer) - 1-0 so far  * Pelicans (Steven Adams)  * Wizards (Westbrook)   * Nuggets (PJ Dozier)  * Sixers (Terrance Ferguson)  * Pacers (Oladipo, Sabonis, McDermott)  * Suns (Cam Payne, CP3)  * Lakers (Schröder, Markieff Morris)  * Nets (Luwawu-Cabarott, KD) - 0-1 so far  * Knicks (Noel, Taj Gibson if they sign him)  * Bucks (DJ Augustin) - 0-1 so far"
PJ Dozier and Will Barton making the critical decisions.  You hate to see it.
"Sindarius Thornwell, PJ Dozier, and Chris Silva. No relation at all."
PJ Dozier aint it man. He's a negative on offense and defense
PJ dozier has been terrible. No idea why he’s getting heavy minutes
&gt;Gary Harris is an abysmal offensive player. More of his minutes need to keep going to PJ Dozier.  This makes no sense
"Gary Harris is really bad and plays too many minutes. More of his minutes need to go to PJ Dozier.   Will Barton handles the ball too much, he's a good player but plays for himself and doesn't know how to get others involved.   Perimeter defense is bad. We give up a ton of open 3s. I don't have the exact stats to back this up, but I guarantee we give up the most corner 3s."
"JaMychal Green(who was out until the suns game), PJ Dozier, Will Barton, and Hartenstein those four are not getting it done right now maybe they’ll turn it around but they are not near the level of production that Grant, Plumlee, and Craig were providing for the team especially defensively"
"Bro it’s cause we are running Dozier at the 4. I swear he needs more minutes, just at the wing. Everyone says we don’t have wing depth but it’s cause we run a frontcourt of Hartenstein, Dozier, and Barton as our second unit. Was so happy to have Jaymychal Green back though he looked like a dog. The others are way too undersized and thin to bang around in the paint.... but yeah I’ve only been impressed by PJ, particularly on the offensive end"
"He needs more minutes specifically more minutes with the starters. Would like to see more of PJ,Lamelo,Gordon,Dozier, Bismack"
"PJ Dozier&gt;&gt;&gt; Craig (who we do NOT miss). PJ was just hurt for a long time.  That said, we badly need a defensive minded 3 who can slot in next to MPJ (who is better as a 4)."
"definitely. Apart from having Murray who's a great scorer, Porter Jr, Barton, Monte Morris, Millsap, Gary Harris, Green, PJ Dozier and Campazzo are decent or good rotation options.   Sixers have just Embiid, Simmons, Harris, Curry, Green, Shake Milton and Dwight as decent rotation guys. Then the likes of Korkmaz, Thybulle or Maxey who are way too green for the current nba  denver has 10 nba guys vs the Sixers 7"
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
"Yeah but I'm pretty sure Jamal is unanimously the 2nd star. Calling Dozier the second star is like saying Smart is our 2nd star. PJ is a baller though, Im rooting for that kid."
"Do you mean PJ as in Porter Jr, or PJ Dozier. If you mean the latter id really have to disagree with you on that one."
*PJ Dozier has entered the chat*
"I don’t know if you’re joking, but PJ Dozier is huge for the nuggets. Our defense has gotten much better with him back"
PJ Dozier is back so the Nuggets will start climbing quickly.
PJ Dozier is a top 10 bench player in the league and I won’t here otherwise.  Star in the making.
"Man we missed PJ Dozier.   Easily our most complete win of the season as the rotation players and Jokic / Murray all had great games. Shout out to Cancar for his hustle.  Also, I stand by assesment that MPJ is going to be a good defender done the line-- so long as he is playing the 4... even if I get downvoted into oblivion every time I type it."
"Including this game and prematurely counting it was a win, the Nuggets are 8-2 in the last ten games PJ Dozier has played with the losses being close to the Jazz and Nets."
"nuggets missing 2 starters and key bench players... our best bench players are PJ dozier who just came back from injury and is averaging 7 points, and Zeke Nnaji who is a rookie averaging 3 points... That’s our 2 best bench players atm. All of our defenders are gone aswell"
I remember PJ Dozier taking #35 in OKC after KD left.
"Overrated: Bol Bol by a country mile. Everybody's begging for him to get playing time but when he does he's just awful.  Underrated: PJ Dozier. Great defensive player, good spot up 3 pt shooter, but gets zero love from the sub."
"Thank NBA for giving us a surprise game against the Nuggets right now, I really wanted that, really.  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-19) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (15-13) ---|---   D. Garland |   Jamal Murray  C. Sexton  | Monte Morris Isaac Okoro |  M. Porter Cedi Osman|   J. Green  Jarrett Allen |   Big Honey  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-19) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (15-13) ---|--- Outback Jesus (OUT)  |   PJ Dozier  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |    G. Harris (OUT)  L. Nance (OUT) :( |  P. Millsap (OUT)  A. Drummond  (OUT) | G. Whittington (OUT)  T. Prince   (OUT) |"
He is statistically still positive and by far the best on the nuggets. Actually PJ Dozier is better but he played 1/20 Jokic's minutes.
"Murray is inconsistent maybe due to injuries,   Grant is gone,   Millsap is older and injured,   Plumlee gone and his replacement is a G league caliber(hartenstein),   Garry Harris injured,   pj dozier injured,   Jamychal Green playing very badly for two weeks and occasionally injured,   Bol Bol is useless,   Monte Morris injured,   Barton unavailable due to personal reasons,   MPJ Shooting 20% so mostly benched also due to very bad plays not just bad shooting  basically 3 people can play right now except rookies. Campazzo, Joker and Murray available only"
"Lol, that other all star didn’t play in that series.  You’re comparing losing to the Washington Wizards without PJ Dozier to losing to the Celtics without Ben Simmons or literally any three point shooters.  And I’m the one whose not too bright?  Air must be pretty thin out their in Denver  I ain’t even gonna sweat it.  Y’all ain’t even making the playoffs this year.  Definitely losing 2 of the next three to Cleveland, Atlanta and Charlotte."
"AD is better than the three starters missing, but he still played 14 minutes whereas none of the Nuggets three played at all, plus PJ Dozier has been out for weeks who provides a lot of needed defense"
"Bro Monte was out last night due to injury. Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Paul Milsap, PJ Dozier were all out. Every single one of those guys is a 20 minute player (PJ probably in the 12-18 range).  We're just not able to find our groove because everyone keeps getting fucking hurt all the time. We just played 18 games in the playoffs in October. Like... This team is exhausted and talent-wise worse than last year (IE missing Grant, Craig, and Plumlee)."
"Idk man that Nuggets bench is pretty good, they got:  Monte Morris  Facundo Campazzo  PJ Dozier  JaMychal Green  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if it's better defensively but efficiency wise they are (even tho they don't shoot at the volume the Knicks bench does), not to mention 11-15 they are by far the best in the NBA imo. I mean RJ Hampton, Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, are all getting minutes on most teams imo."
"I’m a bad homer, but Nuggets are so deep, Idk who will play when we are fully healthy:  Monte Morris, Facu Campazzo, RJ Hampton, PJ Dozier all legit role-players  and the only non-guard bench rotation player: JaMychal Green"
"Yes you're correct that their D has gotten worse. But they've also been running a lot of PJ Dozier and their rookie RJ Hampton as a backup guard next to Monte.  Powell is a significant upgrade on both of those dudes as a dude who can do multiple things offensively. On D, I can only atest to the two games he played against Charlotte since those are the ones I watched full Raptors games, but he seemed fine   Toronto fans will have a better understanding I imagine. Don't feel like going through his defensive advanced stats and all that"
PJ Dozier is now a rotation player for the Nuggets too.
Expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-15) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (12-11) ---|---   D. Garland | Jamal Murray  C. Sexton  |   Will Barton Isaac Okoro |  M. Porter  Jarrett Allen|  Paul Millsap  A. Drummond |   Nikola Jokic  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-15) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (12-11) ---|--- Outback Jesus (OUT)  |      PJ Dozier  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |      G. Harris    (OUT)  L. Nance (OUT) |  G. Whittington  (OUT)
"Nuggets fan here:   We lost Jeremi grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig- which was almost our entire bench unit. Jeremi would come to be a starter and then we’d pull Millsap off the bench, but yeah, our team didn’t get better. Isaiah Hartenstein was signed to replace plumlee but has not been playing well and he’s the only other center on our roster besides Jokic.  Combine that with nagging injuries to Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, and now even PJ Dozier. Our team is being forced to play 3rd string players significant minutes and play our remaining starters too many minutes.   We’ve even attempted small ball (maybe even considered “micro ball”) lineups, with 4 small guards and Jamykel Green at center, who are always outmatched and cannot make up for their size.   The off-season was not kind to us and even though I believe we could still make a splash in the playoffs with reduced rotation, we’re going to have trouble getting a good spot with a healthy bunch at this rate."
"Nuggets-Facu, PJ Dozier, AG, JaMychal Green, JaVale McGee"
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
Nuggets fans do you like PJ Dozier
I will always defend a good role player who fills a role we need. If we reacted to everything The way Barton haters do then they would call half our team trash. These also are same people that think PJ dozier should start over Barton lol.
"Grant, Harris, and Craig were all negative players for the Nuggets last year.    Grant was one of the least productive Nuggets not only through the bubble but everything outside of the clippers series. He showed up for the Nuggets for just over one week and was a negative player who produced below replacement level the rest of his time with the team.   Harris and Craig were big negatives all year.   Morris and Campazzo are both better than Harris on both offense and defense. PJ Dozier is literally just a slightly more effecient Torrey Craig with even better defense. MPJ went from a replacement level bench player to one of the most effecient 20/10 bigs in the league.   Keep sleepin'."
PJ Dozier and (imo) JaVale McGee  JaMychal Green and Facundo Campazzo are in that teir too.
"Didnt have a 3rd quarter one this time, really just from the start of the 4th until about 6 minutes remaining. Argentine fans dont want to hear it, but the Facu Campazzo minutes are a huge problem right now. He is soooooo small that dudes just ignore him on defense now for the most part, drive him right to the rim or shoot right over him. And offensively he is completely unable to make anyone pay for going WAY under screens, he cant shoot at the rim or in the midrange so it's basically like playing 4 on 5 offensively. Murray then can be freely doubled and the whole offense grinds to a halt because PJ Dozier and Millsap and Green arent nearly good enough to pick up the slack playing 3 on 3 with Facu in the corner."
Oh if it was PJ Dozier or someone bigger the refs would have blown their whistle instantly. Refs are pretty consistent on not blowing a whistle if the contact is initiated by a small guy.
"PJ Dozier is so trash lol, its hilarious"
PJ Dozier reminds me of D'Angelo Barksdale  Also his name sounds fake
"You're takes are routinely shockingly off base for someone who has Nuggets flair.  PJ has something like a 6'10"" wingspan. Both he and Craig are SG's who can moonlight at SF on D.  But Dozier is the better playmaker, shooter, help defender and all around player."
"Good lord with the assumptions here, and I'm a fellow Nuggets fan! Jesus man..   I would contend we traded for Gordon because he's way, way better at guarding multiple positions and especially bigger wings and athletic 4s while being a body type/athlete we didn't previously have, and he's a much better offensive player than Dozier as well. This does not mean Dozier is incapable of guarding 3s competently. He spent time on Brandon Ingram both Pelis games and did mostly ok on him for instance, and he's done well against other 3s too. The issue is he's not a very good offensive player, and he's not big enough to guard guys like LeBron and that ilk, and even if he was - you wouldnt want him playing more than 20 minutes a night. You can't have just one guy though who can guard some 3s in limited minutes and be successful. And of course Gordon is a huge upgrade over him guarding 3s, while being a huge upgrade over Millsap/JMG guarding athletic 4s at the same time.   I'm just going to go back to what was supposed to be my main point earlier, saying we don't miss Torrey Craig at all and PJ Dozier is probably a better player than TC3."
"&gt; It's not a coincidence either that once PJ Dozier came back what, 10 games ago, the defense has looked pretty good mostly, aside from the Toronto game.  Correlation doesn't equate to causation. It absolutely is a coincidence, you're reading way too much into it because you have a narrative you're unable to get away from. PJ is not a great defender and is unable to guard 3's competently. Period. That's why we traded for Gordon"
"I'd argue PJ Dozier was the in-house replacement for TC3. Not as tall or physical on defense, but smarter in team defense and can actually handle the ball."
"Because the alternative was PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.   We paid him 20mil to be a below average starter.  He was one small part of that team. He did not will them single handedly, that's honestly laughable to suggest."
1. Jokic 2. Murray 3. MPJ 4. Gordon? 5. Barton 6. Monte Morris 7. PJ Dozier 8. Jamychal Green 9. Facuuu  10. Javale McGee? Idk
I hope the Nuggets go on a big win streak which will be all because of PJ Dozier so he can finally get his recognition
"Not a terrible trade, but I don't think the nuggets do it. Oubre is expiring which isn't great for us, and I don't feel like those two combined give us enough firepower to overcome the Lakers, Clips, or Jazz, which are our main opponents. We also probably don't want to give up PJ dozier, who's looking like our sg/sf of the future."
"PJ Dozier.  He is a top 15 player in the league no matter how much people try to deny it.  Also since you said basketball player and not NBA, AJ Lawson. He may fall in the upcoming draft but he will be a star like PJ.   Sindarius Thornwell too. Get this man a contract."
"Monte Morris, Sabonis, PJ Dozier, Keldon Johnson, Larry Nance, Garry Tent, Josh Hart.   Role players are not sexy"
"No one can guard Jokic on the Dallas, Denver has solutions for Luka so so, AG, Maybe PJ Dozier but his questionable for playing. So I don't think Luka will outperform Jokic, but maybe Mavs as a team outperform Denver if they shot well"
"Ah yes the terrible, healthy in the playoffs starting line up of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Daniel Theis, Aron Baynes and Robert Williams of the bench 3 years ago. A 4-1 loss in the second round is all that could be expected of such a subpar roster. PJ Dozier on a two way then"
This is just not true.   [Some metrics show it was the worst of his career](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-most-improved-defenders-andrew-wiggins-miles-bridges-georges-niang-pj-dozier/)
"The outcome depends on weather Monte, Will Barton and PJ Dozier return to the series. Also depends on weather Dwight Powell shows up to play. That dude can light up. I don't doubt about Luka and Joker showing up."
Do you mean MVPJ Dozier? Aka Pj Composure?
So huge.   People focus on the Murray injury not realizing how many other significant injuries we’ve had or still have  Aaron Gordon Monte morris Will barton PJ dozier  Even millsap missed a game or two.
"Add Monte Morris and PJ dozier, two key players for us and both could miss a bit or all due to injury."
"You might want to look at the Nuggets injuries the second half of the season... it's really only been Jokic and MPJ. 90% of their guards are injured and their basically signing guys off the street to play significant minutes. Will Barton, PJ Dozier, Monte Morris and Jamal Murray have all been gone. Campazzo is literally their third best player now and I'm not even exaggerating. He's even out playing Gordon( who also missed time)"
PJ Dozier   Vlatko Cancar  Austin Rivers
"Without Murray, Gordon, Barton, Morris Morris and PJ Dozier. 5 of our top 8 rotation players are out, including 3 starters."
"LeBron is a forward by position only. He’s really a point guard and the initiator of the offense. And so is DS.  The Lakers don’t have any offense initiators or shot creators right now. Caruso and THT are trying to fill that role but they really don’t have much playmaking ability. They’ve been like secondary or tertiary creators, they’re not primary creators.  That’s why LeBron/DS missing are waaay more major injuries than whatever the Nuggets are facing. Because Jokic can handle all the responsibilities of imitating the offense and creating for others. Meanwhile the Lakers literally have no one on the roster right now that can create for themselves or others.  And you’re being incredibly disingenuous calling Campazzo a useless rookie. He’s 30 years old and legitimately a good role player. He’s like Caruso-lite. Oh, and PJ Dozier played in that LAL game, he wasn’t hurt.  I’m just gonna stop arguin. Will Barton and Monte Morris are not more important than LeBron or DS dude. It’s insane I even have to debate that. The Nuggets actually have players to shoulder the offensive creator role too while the Lakers have no one to fill that role."
PJ Dozier
"It sucks you guys are missing Mitchell and Conley and we’re missing Murray and Barton, as well as both of their backups Monte Morris and PJ Dozier. At least we have Jokic; I feel like he could run an offense with four people selected from the crowd. And Campazzo is a pretty decent playmaker, even though his lack of shooting and size makes his PnR with Jokic pretty useless.   I like Ingles; he’s smart and savvy. I wouldn’t want to rely on Clarkson’s playmaking but at least he can get a bucket as well as most wings."
"Cool so they have Gordon to guard a big, a feature they directly traded wing defense for.  Now how about the fact that Utah's 3 deadliest scorers aren't bigs?  How are you supposed to hide Campazzo on defense when you're facing a lineup of with 2 of Conley/Mitchell/Clarkson on the court at any time?  Garry Harris is gone, Murray is injured.  Barton has been bad at defense this year and Austin Rivers is adequate.  Their only great wing defender is PJ Dozier and he's a negative on the offensive end, he can only guard one person and they can't play him 48 minutes a game."
"It’s disingenuous to point out the lakers without lebron while only mentioning Murray. Nuggets are down 5 guys. Only guards on their roster that arent out are facu-rookie, Markus Howard-rookie(3 mins per game) shaq Harrison(signed less than a month ago, and Austin rivers ( signed less than a month ago). They might be red hot because jokic is truly that good, but it was anything but a surprise. Using that game as a “it already happened” when we’re going to see Monte Morris, will Barton, and pj dozier come back for the playoffs isn’t fair to the nuggets depth at all"
Injuries man. PJ Dozier is out so Millsap started at PF with Porter moving up to SG
"Oh yeah it’s not like we were without 2 starters and 2 replacement starters or anything. Yeah, Barton and Murray played. I just can’t remember them doing anything. Same with Monte Morris who starts when Murray is hurt. Wonder why he didn’t score any?? And PJ Dozier is who we rely on for defense in the fourth quarter. He was nonexistent on defense in the fourth quarter. Almost like he wasn’t even on the court! Craziness"
"come on man... Denver are without Murray, Barton and PJ dozier. Looking at the Rosters of both team it was pretty easy to tell which are the favourite."
Nuggets losing PJ Dozier is a huge deal
PJ Dozier (G/F)---Out indefinitely with a split gooch
Man you know you’re reaching when Dozier is the third guy you list lol. And I love PJ
Pj dozier is #3
pj dozier seeing this: 🥲🥲🥲
"I remember PJ Dozier coming into the 4th quarter of game 2 in the Western Conference finals last year and being downright heroic. He took a charge from AD, got a steal, got an and-1, and got the nuggets back in that game in like 2 minutes.  But he was also 0-4 from the line in a 2 point loss. 😐"
I thought he got traded from the Rockets to the Hornets and lost 40lbs? That’s PJ Dozier right?
I always loved PJ hes defense is top notch..and i wanted him to play instead Barton in starting lineup. Shame Barton had to injure for him to get a proper chance this season .we could use Barton off the bench but yeah Dozier is killing it so far
"I'm obviously biased, but I think it's possible. Our offense is still really good, we have MVP that is MVP sololy because of his offense and MPJ who is just free buckets, it's not as good as with Murray, we have less weapons now, but I'm confident in Jokic and MPJ taking 50+ shots a game in the playoffs, if MPJ keeps shooting good our offense won't have a problem. On the other hand, our defense is better than with Murray and Barton, instead of them we have Facu and PJ, both of them are really good defenders. With starting lineup we now have the team is pretty balanced.   We will know if we are contenders after the next 4 games, we already had the great win against the Clippers, now we have to play Lakers, Jazz, Nets and Knicks. If we win 3 or more we are contenders, if we win less everything is possible but the chances are way slimmer. The team is already 9-1 after Jamal got hurt, with one loss being when Barton got hurt in the first minute of the game. I know that our team doesn't want to blame the loss on injury, but it obviously affected them. It's not like this team can't play without Jamal. We are all sad that he got hurt, but people are really underestimating the Nuggets without him, we are still a good team, in fact we are probably better than in the last year. MPJ is playing like an allstar now, Jokic is better than he was in the last season, AG can guard any wing, and Facu and Dozier (if he is focused) can defend almost any guard."
"Everything is possible when you have PJ Dozier, amirite?"
"It’s not just facu though. Its also PJ dozier getting run with the starters. It’s also Austin rivers and shaq Harrison. And it’s also the millsap/green pairing in the bench getting more comfortable.  It’s a lot of different things.  Go back and watch the handful of games after the Gordon trade before the Murray injury. One of the reasons we were so excited about this teams potential was because *both* ends of the floor were clicking. By moving thrill up to the 2 instead of having him play the 3, suddenly we were oversized with him, mpj, and Gordon on the wings. We were basically switching everything 1-4 and occasionally even switching with Jokic.  The players even talked about how much they loved the free flowing style on defense and how it also translated to the offensive end. This team has always played best when they are loose and having fun and that was a big part of it.  All of that went out the window with Murray’s injury because our replacement options at the time were Monte Morris and facu, who are both too short to do that with. Then Barton goes down. Dozier is long AF (and I would have been down for dozier-Barton after Murray’s injury, but Malone would never do that) and is a great defender for sure, but the switch everything plan is out the window as soon as facu is involved.  But what did happen is our guard depth was so thin that we brought in shaq Harrison and Austin rivers. Those guys have really bought into their roles as defense first guys. Our second unit has been mauling people defensively. We basically transitioned from a high powered dynamic offensive team to the grit n grind grizzlies where we just play at an even more glacial pace through Jokic, clamp down on D, and our second unit lives off of transition buckets from turnovers and whatever scraps we can get in the half court offense from Millsap, random buckets from MPJ when he’s staggered with that unit, or positive shooting variance from 3 from a group of somewhat unreliable 3 point shooters. Millsap and green are both fine catch and shoot 3 point threats, but there’s not really enough rim gravity or shot creation to get them open looks consistently. Both of them are pick and pop threats with no rollers really, so it’s rare for them to get open looks outside of defensive collapses. Javale plays minutes occasionally and he changes that a bit, but offensively the bench is still very limited.  Basically, the team identity has changed entirely and it’s really unfair to put all of that at Murray’s feet. We absolutely still miss him and will especially miss him in the 2 man game/3 man game (with Gordon) on offense. It really unlocked Gordon as a roll threat"
"Not really sure about that honestly. Sure with Kawhi and PG in theory they have dudes they can throw at LeBron, same as the Nuggets can throw AG, MPJ, PJ Dozier and maybe JaMychal Green / Millsap at LeBron... but the Clips realistically dont have a guy they can put on AD. For the Nuggets, at least Millsap guarded him well last year in the playoffs statistically and if worse comes to worse they can try GIANT lineups with JaVale McGee. Joker can also hang with AD when AD is at the 5 (and statistically got the better of him on offense, shot 10-17 (ish - might have been 9-16?) against him in the WCF with like a 5:1 A:TO ratio).   I'm just saying that no team truly matches up well with the Lakers. The Nuggets I think actually matchup better than the Clips on the whole defensively at least. The Bucks are close as well, though Khris Middleton leaves something to be desired defensively. He's solid there but not as physical as AG or as athletic, to say nothing of fully engaged Kawhi of course."
PJ ”Slim Reaper” Dozier
"He's finesse. Getting physical with him REALLY bothers him. You could see it all game. PJ Dozier, Facu, and MPJ were all up in his jock the whole game and by the 3rd quarter he was settling, taking bad shots, and looking generally extremely frustrated.   He's also just not a great passer, despite the Clips wanting to make their offense him and Kawhi PnRs. It basically devolves into ISOs when things get tough."
You said Jamal production was replaced by PJ Dozier. Am I correct in that statement?
I always confuse PJ Dozier and RJ Hampton for some reason
"nuggets have a meat grinder of backup point guards.  Imagine being Dame or something and   you have to get harassed by Facu then Shaquille.  Even PJ Dozier is like a fake point forward sometimes, just because the Nuggets can"
Joker did this many times. Here is one.  [Nikola Jokic 0.8 second Full-Court Outlet Pass to PJ Dozier!!! Best Passing Big?! Denver Nuggets - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M2LMKPZtQk)
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."
PJ Dozier for MVP.
"Malone was most definitely not relying on PJ Dozier last year, what are you talking about?"
Yeah I absolutely lose it at times when PJ Dozier does a Fadeaway mid range like Kobe. Malone doesn't seem to mind though which I'm annoyed by. He gives old ass Millsap way too much freedom too. He isn't a great offensive coach if he didn't have the most Offensively talented center of all time.
"And, Jokic has the spacing of Austin, Facu, Harrison, Aaron Gordon and PJ Dozier and is still winning games."
"PJ Dozier actually averages .8 blocks per/36, which is higher than simmons   i think dozier is up there"
"Our guard rotation atm is Facu, PJ Dozier, Shaq Harrison and Austin Rivers bro.  That's-- a let's go get Cade Cunningham rotation."
"I would say PJ Dozier because he's legitimately a really good role player and an amazing defensive player, but I think that random Celtics fan has made so many posts about him that it evens out."
No Jaxson Hayes on Reggie Jackson or PJ Dozier?
"You do realize defensive rating is a team stat right? Pj dozier is top 5 in defensive rating, why isn't he in talks for DPOY?"
Whatever you say bro. Team was substantially better than last year's team.  Jokic &gt; last year's Jokic Gordon &gt; Grant  MPJ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last year's MPJ PJ Dozier &gt; Craig  Just in regards to MPJ alone you are talking about going from a slight negative player to a legit 3rd star coming of age.
"PJ Dozier deserves to be on an NBA roster now. He's not like particularly good or anything but he'll probably be in the league a while. He some upside, probably becomes a viable rotation piece in the playoffs in the next couple years."
how dare you put Jokic above PJ Dozier. #casual
There were four nuggets with a better +/- than Jokic though...   PJ Dozier was a team high +24 to Joks +11
So we really gonna disrespect pj dozier
You forgot about the GOAT PJ Dozier
Who's guarding PJ Dozier?
"Malone’s biggest weakness is his rotations IMO. Other than that, I think he’s a pretty good coach. Yeah, maybe he gets bailed out a bit by his star players, but every coach does. NBA is a star driven league.  Strengths:  -	Culture/chemistry/locker room. Not sure exactly what you want to call this, but he’s absolutely been great at getting guys to buy in to the culture. After the shaw debacle and our culture was in the toilet, he rebuilt it. Jokic was a big part of that, but you also have to think about the fact that there’s plenty of orgs where Jokic could have gone and never achieved the greatness he has now. The culture and locker room are part of that. Same thing with MPJ. -	player development. This kind of ties into the above, but we have had a seriously great run of young guys coming in. A big part of that is Connelly drafting well, but you have to give Malone credit for his staff developing those guys into players as well   Weaknesses:  -	Rotations. I think that all of us routinely want to pull our hair out at some of his rotation decisions. Especially when he falls in love with a defensive hustle guy (like facu or craig) and arguably plays them way too often and in lineups that don’t make sense. I think there’s also an aspect of line up identity - more so with the bench than the starters - that sometimes gets lost. What roles is each guy playing? What is that lineup trying to do? I think Malone doesn’t look at it from the perspective of “okay this bench unit is going to have the 1/5 pnr as its bread and butter with XYZ as secondary options out of ABC sets” etc. I think for him he views everything through the lens of effort and defense. Even if it means playing a 4 guard lineup with PJ dozier at PF and Millsap at C. All that said, he is a pretty successful NBA coach, so it’s possible he knows more than we do here - and part of these baffling rotations might actually tie in to his management style that helps with the first bullet point under strengths to build a good locker room chemistry.  Middling:  -	X’s and O’s. I put this here because I don’t think it’s explicitly a weakness, but I also don’t think it’s a huge strength like it is for some of the other coaches in the league. And that’s OK, since different coaches have different styles. Especially when you have a savant like Jokic who just needs a loose framework in place to build off of and he does the minutiae himself. I do think part of the reason this isn’t a strength is tied back into the rotation thing. A coach who is strong at X’s and O’s is likely going to extend that same strategic thinking to the overall lineups and rotations. Guys are in for a reason because they are cogs in the machines and the sets. They have a role and a purpose. That’s not to say that’s totally absent with Malone, but again I think he views everything through effort and defense first and foremost. His overall philosophy is if you have those ingredients first and foremost, everything else will work itself out. You can overcome lineup deficiencies through that effort. I don’t necessarily agree, because I think there’s sometimes where you’re just simply outmatched on the chess board, but given that this is lost lot gripes about bench units, it doesn’t matter as much. Starters being matched up on the chess board is much more about the GM constructing the roster (ie getting Jerami grant and Aaron Gordon to match up with lebron/kawhi). Assuming the GM and coach are on the same page, anyway. Not always the case with guys like Javale McGee not getting minutes, but again that’s more of a bench thing."
"Denver prioritized size with putting money to Millsap and Green (probably to matchup with Lakers frontcourt), and the emergence of PJ Dozier made Craig expendable as a back up wing. For the Bucks, not sure why they gave him away since they didn't need to clear a roster spot."
PJ Dozier will be finals MVP
Where is PJ Dozier
"Is PJ Dozier in the MVP conversation? After this game I seriously think that he has a better MVP case than Jokic, Embiid, Giannis and Curry, maybe even combined."
"Nuggets lineup right now isn’t exactly fire. Our best pick and roll guard is defensive specialist PJ Dozier with Jamal, Monte and Barton out."
"Barton got injured a minute into the game. With Jamal, Barton and Monte out the team just doesn’t have any perimeter ball handling, shooting or playmaking. The best pick roll guard is like PJ Dozier which isn’t great."
"If PJ dozier and campazzo were hitting open 3s it would be fine game by him. No barton was huge, has to watch dozier take like 8 3s was super painful to watch"
I mean we just lost our 5th guard out of our top 5 guards in the preseason depth chart so that time may be fast approaching.   We’re literally playing a Shaq Harrison-Austin Rivers-PJ Dozier-JaMychal Green-Jokic lineup rn fml
"Possibly Austin Rivers. We don't do it often.  Lots of awesome G league, 2 ways though between Torrey Craig, PJ Dozier and Shaq Harrison. Hell even Chris Anderson back in the way back."
"Most people are blaming him for this inconsistency, but when you watch these games he goes long stretches without touching the ball.  This seems to be a recurring theme.  The Denver play calling seems to make it a point to emphasize other players and move away from MPJ.  His useage rate has dropped to 18.7 since the Murray injury when you would think his useage rate would skyrocket, but players like PJ Dozier (19.8), Will Barton (20.9), and Paul Milsap's (28.2) useage rates have surged even with incredibly low effective fg%s(45% compared to MPJ's 70%).  My theory is he isn't liked on the team by coaches and other players."
I don’t know. PJ Dozier played 2ish years without one.   *we playing with real men over here!*
"PJ Dozier, you know, the MVP candidate? Try watching some games, casual."
"We already had a lineup w Facu, Monte, Jamal and PJ Dozier at the 4 called the mini lads lineup. It went horrible lol"
Can someone explain to me what’s going on with Aaron Gordon? PJ Dozier was getting minutes over him last night.
Not one of his better games. Still I’d be pretty surprised if it was a coaches decision. PJ Dozier or Facu would have been the odd man out had AG gone back in. My totally speculative assumption is he tweaked something.
"Why, who wore #35 before PJ Dozier?"
Bro. We have PJ Dozier.
The disrespect to PJ Dozier
PJ Dozier will save our season guaranteed 😩🙏
1. IT  2. Pierce  3. Tatum  4. Garnett  5. Crowder  6. PJ Dozier  7. Horford  8. Kawhi  9. MPJ  10. Big Baby
"PJ too.   People incredibly underrate how good PJ Dozier is.  That man is one of the best and most versatile defenders in the league. Can defend 1-3 *very* effectively. He has insane lateral quickness, good size (6'7""), and is an excellent rebounder.   His offensive game is pretty limited but he will hit his open threes as well as his layups off of Jokic dimes."
You give Denver PJ Dozier and they winning the chip
PJ Dozier on the Nuggs too
"Well, since Paul and Booker blew by Nuggets' guards, Jokic was mostly left with the choice to try to contest the shot or stick with the big guy below the rim and he usually chose the latter. Now you can say that he should be able to do both, but I think that there are no more than four or five centers that can do that, so it's a bit unfair to call Jokic a trash defender because he's not elite. There are levels to this. With a couple of decent defenders (nothing too fancy, like PJ Dozier), things wouldn't have looked that bad."
I think that’s where PJ Dozier comes in. He was hurt too but he was a defensive guard who could hit wings too. I wouldn’t say we would have won but we would Have put up more of a fight.
With Jamal Murray? And PJ Dozier.  This is a long series
"its almost like chris paul was matched up against players that werent in the league half of the year, were under 6' tall, or were just really bad. even pj dozier out there would have made a huge difference defending chris paul. it is what it is, but lets be honest about why denver couldnt defend."
IT WASNT JUST MURRAY WHO WAS HURT   PJ Dozier is our best perimeter defender and the best defender on the team in general   Will Barton was out the first two games and not at full speed in the next two
Not having Murray and Barton in the starting lineup killed our spacing which severely limited Aaron Gordon's ability to impact the game offensively and allowed the Suns to key in on stopping MPJ from getting open.   Monte Morris had a rough game 1 and should've started the entire series. And non-Nuggets fans forget we were without PJ Dozier who is our best guard defender and one of the few bench guys who can get his own shot.   I disagree with the sentiment that other players weren't playing hard. We were just a banged up team going up against a fully healthy squad playing their best basketball of the season.
We needed pj Dozier/Gary Harris  One is injured the other traded
I mean we had that with PJ Dozier and Gary Harris. Traded Gary away and Dozier was injured. Otherwise we would've made it more competitive
"It’s not just Murray, pj dozier is their best perimeter defender, probably an important piece to limiting the Suns backcourt. Get lost you casual."
"Most of those arent the same tier tf. Conley played the entire grizzlies series and is their 3rd best player, cp3 has been fine since game 6 of the lakers series, embiid has been dropping almost 40 a night he's fine currently, nets I agree, divencenzo is not that big a of a loss comparatively, ibaka has been out for months, hawks were gonna lose to the sixers anyway. Nuggets have murray, pj dozier, Barton just came back, MPJ has been playing like shit because of his back."
Nobody talking about pj dozier being out. He is their best perimeter defender and a very capable playmaker.
"Yeah, there are a few things missing. We need a couple of shot creating guards who can stretch the floor and playmake, and run the pnr with jokic. Oh, Murray and Barton. We've also been getting killed on weak side help rotations, need an elite perimiter defender with size and IQ who can switch and keep the ball moving on offense, that would be key against the Suns. Oh, PJ Dozier."
"&gt;if ANY team lost their entire front court yeah it wouldn’t be good  But it's fine if a team loses nearly their entire backcourt? The matchup is the problem- you'd be getting smacked if you had Frank instead of Ayton on Jokic, which is why he isn't playing this series.   We're down Murray and Dozier, plus Barton was out in game 1 and on a heavy minutes restriction in games 2 and 3, and hasn't played since April. He was just -2 in game 2 and +2 tonight btw, so there's evidence this would be a wildly different series if we had him and PJ at 100%, not even including Murray.  You know why there isn't chemistry? Because 3/4 of the guards who have experience playing with Jokic are out or severely limited. We had 7 guards to start the season (Murray/Barton/Harris/Morris/Dozier/Hampton/Facu). That's too many, so we traded Harris and Hampton for Gordon, who works in space. Then Murray, Barton and Dozier all went down (and Monte for a while too), so we were left with just Monte and Facu, then signed Rivers and Shaq off their couches. No team can plan to lose 3/4 of their top guards, and teams have depth in different places. We swapped guard depth for forward depth, and then all our guards went down. Can't really plan for that! If we lost a guard and one of Millsap/Green instead of Dozier, it would be much easier to handle. Those limitations exist for all teams.   You guys have more backcourt depth than frontcourt depth, hence comparing the situation to you losing 3/4 of your top frontcourt players at once, and having your 2nd best remaining player get injured. A suns team of CP3-Payne-injured Bridges-Saric-and minutes restriction Ayton would be getting hammered by a fully healthy Nuggets team lol, no teams are build to withstand season ending injuries to their #2 player. That's just ridiculous and it's clear you haven't been self aware about your extreme injury luck this year if that's your take. We thought it couldn't get worse after the Murray injury and then what a surprise, we lost our #2 and #4 options to fill that role! Having 0 remaining shot creators is a problem for any team, and it's just bad luck."
"They need a good, switchable tweener with size and quickness who can switch and play good team defense, and a dynamic guard who can playmake, space the floor and slot next to jokic. Like Jamal Murray and PJ Dozier, perhaps?"
pj dozier was in the rotation
"Even then they had issues, murray ACL, Mpj got covid for a month, Monte got injured for a bit, Barton had a hamstring issue, Pj dozier one of their best guard defenders went down too.  Just wild"
"no Murray, no PJ Dozier, MPJ playing with a back injury, Will Barton missing games with a hamstring.  Those aren't excuses, those are facts."
"Add in a healthy Barton and PJ Dozier. We literally have one player capable of playing in the pnr, Monte. Those 3 are also our 3 best perimeter defenders."
"Get to play Barton, Murray, and PJ dozier."
Not even just jamal. Pj dozier is injured and Barton is on a minutes restriction. Plus mpj was playing on a tweaked back in game 2.
So is PJ dozier out for the rest of the season ?
I don't think I've ever missed PJ Dozier as much as I do right now
"Starting 5 is Murray/Barton/AG/MPJ/Jokic with Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, and JaMychal Green subbing in and out on a fully healthy roster. Facu averaged 9 minutes a game before Jamal went down and Rivers wasn’t on the team"
"I think we are definitely in a bad spot, for sure. The only thing I can think of is maybe if we get PJ dozier back we can have some extra length on the perimeter. That helps cascade down because it frees up Gordon to not have to cover booker all the time.  [Plays like this](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1402822522752667650?s=21) are tough because Gordon is probably our best rim protector but we have him out on an island guarding booker because all of our guards are broken lol. And cp3 knows/exploits this.  Dozier also gives us another ball handler who can penetrate and get some movement from the suns D so that we hopefully aren’t just [running a stagnant offense where everyone stands around and watches Jokic try to make magic happen by himself in the paint](https://i.imgur.com/nrWNjCC.jpg). Barton will help with that some as well, of course.  That said, it certainly does feel like we are both lacking firepower on the offensive end (though last night was an extreme shooting variance from 3 - we got some decent looks early that just wouldn’t fall) and have some defensive flaws that one of the best tacticians in the game is exploiting. MPJ has improved a lot as a defender this year from where he was last year, but he’s still got a long way to go. And if his shot isn’t falling (like last night), his game looks really rough. Getting abused like that on the defensive end surely also hurts his confidence. He’s a young guy who takes that stuff personally.  I never fully count out this group because they have shown a ton of resiliency in the past, but it’s certainly looking rough right now."
PJ Dozier still injured?
"Barton (our starting SG) has been out since April- he’s our best shot creator and playmaker outside of Jokic and Murray. He made his return tonight but only played 15 mins. Porter is injured and it shows. And PJ Dozier, our #2 SG, is also out- he’s our best team defender. The biggest issue is that the two guys out are the two who would replace Murray normally, so we’re starting dudes on two way contracts lmao."
Is there any timetable for PJ Dozier?
It's not just Jamal dude.  Jamal- Mitchell / Booker level player Barton- A solid starting level player in this league PJ Dozier- Our best perimeter defender  And now MPJ-- who is good for 20 points every night on elite efficiency
"or a healthy MPJ, or a healthy PJ dozier, or a healthy will barton  we just need our fuckin team back, man"
Will Barton and PJ Dozier!?!?!? Noooo please don’t send them! I’m so scared guys
Random Question: is PJ Dozier still hurt?
"So is Facu the third string behind Murray and Morris or is he fourth, behind PJ Dozier?  Dozier is pretty positionless so idk"
"Where the fuck is PJ DOZIER??? I thought that kid was such a solid SGA-type guy, is he hurt too?"
"PJ Dozier can def make him work.  Unfortunately, he's still out hurt."
"We also have PJ Dozier, who gives us a lot of what Torrey did on defense."
"He would probably be coming back as a backup/situational defender/locker room guy.  But it depends on what he wants. I think he’s still got love for the guys here for sure, but he may still want to carve out a path for himself as a starter where he was before the injuries. But I could potentially see him thinking “I’ve already gotten paid, I’m gonna go back to the culture and locker room I love and be a role player in a winning situation.” Maybe he does, maybe he doesn’t.  I love him to death, but after his injuries I think he caps out as a role player now. But if he proves me wrong I’ll be cheering for him all the same.  Re: Monte, I think he’s going to continue to be our 6th man who leads our bench unit/flexes into the steering unit/sometimes closes out games for us. Next year he probably starts while Jamal is out ofc, but long term I think that’s still the plan for him. He does offer some interesting options alongside Murray by taking Murray off ball and letting him do more that way, but we also saw our defense get entirely unlocked with Murray and Barton after the Gordon trade. We just had so much length and athleticism and switched basically everything. If there’s one knock on Monte, it’s his size. So there is a real opportunity cost to moving him to the starting lineup. But it’s absolutely something he can do and even once we are back to fill strength I would be 0% surprised if he’s closing out games for us over Barton (or whoever our long defensive 2 guard of the future is) in some scenarios.  There was also a pipe dream that the nuggets would trade for lonzo at the deadline/sign him in RFA this offseason with the idea that he can do about 80% of what Monte does as a floor general and 80% of what PJ Dozier does as a defender in one package. I don’t think it’s realistic that we go for him, but it would be an interesting fit for sure."
Love to see Dame showing respect to the GOAT PJ Dozier.
PJ Dozier is good and all.....
"Man you should delete these, you are making yourself look really uneducated here.  We were missing both our starting guards, AND one of our most versatile defenders (who can also initiate the offense) in PJ Dozier.  We literally started a rookie in the NBA (albeit with a lot of Euro league experience) and a guy who wasn't on our team until a few weeks before the playoffs.  Oof what a terrible post."
"The Nuggets didn’t have Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and PJ Dozier and the Blazers still lost. That’s their 3 best guards."
They didn’t have Will Barton or PJ Dozier either
"Even crazier when you realize we've also drafted/signed really good quality players in Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig and Huancho who we just didn't have the money to keep around. Not sure how we keep replacing guys but it's nice. Pretty sure Hampton is gonna wind up to be a good player too, but I'm fine with giving up him to get AG.  Also nailed it with the Jerami Grant trade last year. Acquiring PJ Dozier was clutch too. I thought we were gonna take a dip in that department when Masai left but we really haven't missed a beat."
"And PJ Dozier, our best guard defender."
Face it - if PJ Dozier is your best perimeter defender then y'all a bit light on perimeter defense.
"Without Gary Harris and PJ Dozier, we'd let Payton Pritchard average 40 on us. Mitchell was doing the same last year until Gary came back."
"Imagine if the nuggets had Jamal Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier...this series would be over already. Blazers go full rebuild if they lose"
Yeah dame should aim for being like pj Dozier first
"And PJ Dozier, their best defender statistically."
Remind yourself that 60 of 74 championships were won by 8 teams and PJ Dozier doesn't really push the needle regardless if he plays or not.
Will Barton and PJ Dozier on the nuggets have been out for a about a month with groin injuries
"MPJ improved a lot but he's struggling with consistency, especially now in the playoffs, which is perfectly understandable considering his age. But even if he played better, I wish that would have been enough for us to truly be better than last year.   Jerami Grant is an excellent two-way player and we couldn't really find a replacement for him. Gordon is good on defence but sometimes invisible on offence. Jamychal Green is okay as a backup but nothing more. Milsap is one year older and he can give you a quarter of good basketball every like five games but that's it.  People forget how important Gary Harris was last year. Him coming back from injury turned that series vs Jazz. Murray balled out but we actually lost one of those games where he scored 50 and then won the last two with Harris. Craig was great on defence as well and our replacements for him are PJ Dozier (injured) and Zeke Nnaji (not playing).  Plumlee had his issues (AD buzzer beater flashback) but he was a solid backup big overall and we couldn't find a replacement for him. Javale isn't playing much and we usually go with Green at five which isn't working that well.  Campazzo is a positive but he's not much of a scorer and we need scoring badly. He would be a backup with Murray healthy but our bench is terrible at scoring anyways, so he wouldn't contribute much on that end anyway. Morris is playing worse than last year. And yeah, Barton is injured again although he might come back in the next few games."
"Also for a team without their second best player it's usually useful to have at least most of the rotation healthy but the Nuggets don't have Barton and PJ Dozier, now world beaters but they'd be a welcome addition to them, and still Jokić is an unstoppable force no matter who surrounds him, unreal."
"Eh I mean we're literally missing 2 starters, and our best guard defender in PJ dozier. We're playing 2 players we signed on 10 day contracts a month and a half ago, and a rookie who only started playing in May."
&gt; Denver entered the season with one of the deeper guard rotations in the NBA. &gt;  &gt; PG: Jamal Murray / Monte Morris / Facu Campazzo / Markus Howard &gt;  &gt; SG: Gary Harris / Will Barton / PJ Dozier / RJ Hampton  Dude read even just the first few sentences
"bold statement considering that PJ Dozier ,Barton , Murray are Injured and up until couple games ago Morris."
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
So you forgot that Gordon is equal or bette than grant on defense and PJ Dozier outperformed Craig when Craig was still here?
Will Barton and PJ Dozier are injured. Technically they are forwards but the team is really just Jokic and 4 other guys currently.
Gary Harris was there previously. His replacement PJ Dozier is injured
"Yes, while I think he is not the best coach, us losing this series cannot be blamed on him. He should experiment more though, he should adjust defense a bit and play Jokic more minutes (feeling the momentum in the game is Malone's biggest weakness), I would even go crazy tall-ball with Javale on center, but in reality even Popovic cannot make adjustments to make up for Murray, Barton and PJ Dozier. We look damn good after all start break when we were complete. We were beating Clippers with ease, total control of the game from the start to end. With Jamal out champiship hopes died. With Barton and PJ, we cannot really expect some good playoff run. We may get a game or two on some Joker/MPJ heroics with combo of Portland being cold, but that is it."
"Well, yeah. We lost Murray and Barton and our long guard from the bench PJ Dozier (who would be super useful against your team).  That is a lot of fire power. It is like you losing Nurkic, Covington and Kanter, and having Harry Giles, RHJ and Melo be front court against Jokic. That is where we are now against Dame. See without all that shooting power and length your team can play very relaxing defense and save themselves for offense.  Our championship hopes went away with Jamal, and our good playoff run hopes went away with Barton (even if he comes back in a game or two, he will be rusty) and PJ.  I hope we are healthier next year."
Having PJ dozier fixes so much for us never mind Murray and barton
"You’re right but also way to confident/conceited for playing a team that’s missing Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and PJ Dozier who would add defense to the second unit. It’s pretty lame talking shit against a wounded animal and y’all still might lose. Blazers franchise is at a sad point tbh. Dame will never have a ring and he deserves one because he’s amazing, but clowns like you make the team unlikable."
"PJ Dozier probably would have helped their guard rotation, hes their best perimeter defender"
"Dozier is better than Craig.  The Harris for Gordon trade was to get more size at the wing. Definitely hurts a bit in some of the guard heavy matchups like Portland, but helps against teams like LA. It’s just really exacerbated by Murray, will, and PJ being injured.   If we don’t get ravaged by guard injuries, the Harris + RJ trade for Gordon is fine."
"I gotta ask again, will Will Barton and PJ Dozier be able to return for this series?"
When do Thrill and PJ Dozier return? Seems Denver always have someone injured.
"He was a bench player who was only starting because a starter got hurt. Saying ""the Nuggets are missing 3 starters"" is misleading. PJ Dozier is not a starting caliber player."
"People don't realize how massive PJ Dozier has been for our squad. He's our best defender when you factor in his size(Facu is better but is 5'10). Right now as it stands, we have two good guard defenders in Facu and Shaq, and Shaq is a complete nonfactor on offense."
"“Far superior cast?” That’s debatable. He went 10-2 without 2 of his starters in Murray and Barton. Monte Morris, their bench PG, and one of their best defenders in PJ Dozier weren’t available either. One of the teams he beat was a clippers team with both of their stars. Dame’s team has been healthy all throughout April and May, and he by no means has a weak roster. Your second point isn’t even true, Jokic leads the league in box +/- (by far, 11.7 compared to Curry’s 8.1), win shares, VORP, and PER."
We don’t have PJ dozier either.....
Facu is at the very least equal to Gary as far as perimeter defense. Idk if Gary ever reached the level Facu has displayed but Gary showed it over a larger sample and in bigger moments so he still gets some credit there.   The two midseason injury-replacement acquisitions were with defense in mind. Austin Rivers is serviceable on defense. Good for a bench guard. Shaq Harrison is a plus guard defender who offers almost nothing in offense in exchange.   PJ Dozier can defend 1-3 at a very high level. Whether he will be back and looking healthy on the court is a question mark though.   Monte Morris is serviceable but definitely has faults that Dame can exploit.   Nuggets guard defense has actually improved with all the injuries. They just lost almost all offensive production from those spots instead.
"Third leading scorer Will Barton, 2nd string shooting guard PJ Dozier"
Barton played in that series. Their other injury was PJ Dozier and no offense but he doesn’t change anything
"Offense: G Jamal Murray, G Monte Morris, F Will Barton, F MPJ, C Nikola Jokic  Defense: G PJ Dozier, G Shaq Harrison, F Aaron Gordon, F Paul Millsap, C Javale???"
"not just that but our decimated guard lineup meant we were missing not only offense but defense also. pj dozier is our best perimeter defender and Barton aint half bad, but he was playing nowhere near 100% since he basically begged to be taken off minutes restriction"
"It wasn’t just Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier also missed most of the postseason. Their whole guard rotation was fucked"
"PJ Dozier, Aaron Gordon, Bol Bol, Barton, 2 FRP, 1 pick swap for Simmons and Shake Milton.   Nuggets go with Monte/Murray/MPJ/Simmons/Jokic. Bench of Facu/Shake/Nanji/Green. Not bad"
"His assists were hampered by having Jamal Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier out.   You can throw as many perfect passes as you want, but if they're to Austin Rivers or Facu Campazzo they're not going to register as stats and people on reddit will say you're not an elite playmaker."
"&gt; Suns vs. Nuggets: The Suns absolutely destroyed the Nuggets. Murray may have made it a 5-Game series, but anyone who thinks the Nuggets win this series is out of their mind.  Im glad that you are able to make such hot takes without even watching the team you are writing about.   No, it's not Murray. It's Murray, PJ Dozier, and Barton to the extent. 3 Crucial players, 3 starters, and just by ignoring the existence of PJ you proved that you dont know shi&amp; about Nuggets. The kid is **more** important part of the Nuggets game throughout the season, much more so than Barton, and almost as important as Murray   PJ is valuable on both Offense and Defense. Defensively, he is better than AG even, and is a superb PnR defender. Offensively, he is the one player besides Murray that completely realizes moving game suitable for Jokic. Stats dont show it (that's why you dont know about it) but he is always-active wing player that opens 3 possibilities for Jokic - by utilizing constant movement (and in the right places) he enables Jokic to either go in the post with a 2nd defender being in the middle, either to receive pass from Jokic with his defender getting closer to Jokic, or for Jokic to find an open shooter because his defender is currently switching on open PJ that switched on a previous screen. You dont even have the idea of how valuable PJ is, and Suns would burn from fully healthy Nuggets barely winning 2 games."
"Oh you mean the Nuggets 5th guard who wouldn’t play anything other than maybe occasional defensive spot minutes in the normal playoff rotation?  PJ Dozier is the best defender on the team and actually really important against perimeter-based teams like Phoenix. He’s also the one who initially replaced Murray before also going down.   Flexing on 30 year old rookie Campazzo for being subpar (we KNEW that) is like someone flexing on E’Tuan Moore for being subpar if Phoenix had to start him at the point in a second round series next to Carter. Literally, that’s the situation Denver was in."
"&gt;Westbrook had a quad issue that didn’t allow him to drive and was clearly off from covid.  Yeah him underperforming year and year is obviously because of COVID.  Give me a break lmao. Westbrook looked 100% health-wise. He was just flat out playing like shit. Couldn’t hit a jump shot to save his life.  &gt;When did I compare them? By this subs logic. If the heat took the fully healthy lakers to 6 without a healthy Bam and their LEADING scorer, surely they would have won if everyone was healthy  Is this a rhetorical question?  &gt;I also love how you threw in will Barton, monte Morris, Marcus Morris, and ibaka lmfao   I threw in those guys because it caused Denver to have to start Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers. Probably should have listed PJ Dozier as well."
PJ Dozier does.
"Wow guys does this matter less? Let's have this discourse. Does anyone not give a fuck about how I've been crying for the last 10 minutes? Is this the most fake real championship run? Would the Lakers beat us if only Andre Ingram was called up? What if PJ Dozier was there?   We fucking deserve this. And we will be there or thereabouts for the next 5 years. An excellent young core, led by the Point God. I am now officially a Point Disciple. He grinded my gears this series so much but he showed up in the most important game in his career with the best NBA playoff game of his life. At 36. Without having any inhuman physical ability other than the tightest handle of all time.  This Suns team is incredible. Better than 7SOL. And it's going to the NBA Finals. And might win them. Go Suns. Fucking, Go Suns."
"We didn’t have Barton for most of the series. And he was on minute restriction. Also we were missing PJ Dozier, our best perimeter defender. So please, admit you’re lucky and go"
Yeah PJ Dozier played without one of his ACLs for most of his HS career. Your knees are more functional without an ACL than one would expect.
I would say sun since their oppenent lost their main star each round except in 2nd round againts nugget but they were also missing will Barton and PJ Dozier
PJ Dozier was number 2. Dozier is actually an NBA caliber player tho.
"Nuggets need Jamaal Murry   I think a more generic way of saying this is the pnr is the cornerstone of most NBA offenses, and come playoffs both players in a PNR have to be able to at least scare the defense. Denver didn't just lose Murray both Morris and Barton came back during the playoffs and were obviously not 100%, PJ Dozier was also out. That left Denver with no guard that could run a PNR with Jokic and punish them when both defenders left with Jokic or at least both shaded towards Jokic. Late in the Blazers series Morris was able to do that in spurts, but Rivers couldn't and Facu couldn't.   It happened to the blazers, we trapped Dame and Nurkic couldn't consistently punish the backside of the defense. It happened in Philly, Ben Simmons couldn't punish the defense either, oddly enough I didn't think Philly did enough to prove that Capella could beat the weakside help by trapping a ton off screens. It happened to Dallas, they stopped running PNR cause it just meant doncic got doubled."
"Well it’s kind of weird to think about but all of Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr, Monte Morris, and Aaron Gordon are 25 or younger. Plus, they have some other intriguing pieces include Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, PJ Dozier, and Markus Howard. They could run a respectable NBA rotation with just their young guys, which makes them all the more dangerous with some veteran signings."
They are paying Gobert 30% of their cap sheet so they don't have to stock the team with defensive players. It would be as if Denver needed to surround Jokic with top-tier offensive players to have a good enough offence instead of going after people like AG and PJ Dozier to fill out their team.
Meanwhile Jokic had a better defensive season while playing way heavier minutes + having to play with MPJ who still gets lost a lot on defense + half his team being hurt with the teams best defenders out a good part in Harris (before he was traded) and PJ Dozier.
"&gt;that was a while ago and things are different now.  It was a little over a year ago, not that long lmao. But I mean yeah, now the Clippers are worse and the Nuggets are even better lol. Even in that same series Murray averaged like 30 a game against Pat Bev, PG and Kawhi so I really don't know what you're talking about. When was the last time Gobert or Embiid stopped Jokic? Unless you're a Jrue Holiday type defender, I'm not seeing too many people that can slow down Murray or many guys that can contest a 3 pointer from MPJ.  &gt;tons of players who will pick on your front court to hell  Again, we have AG who can effectively guard anyone 1-4, but is at his best when matching up against bigger wings. PJ Dozier is probably our best guard defender so he (assuming he's healthy) can match up with the likes of PG or Booker.   Team defense is a thing and overall I don't think we're any less equipped to handle a team with good offensive players than any anyone else, especially of the teams/players you mentioned."
"Only by guards though, not through wings. PJ Dozier was a huge huge miss"
Part of the reason the Nuggets were ready to get rid of Gary was because they have faith that PJ Dozier can replace the Harris role on defense while being a somewhat better shooter on way less money. The POA defender is probably the most important position in the Nuggets defense because we give up so many floaters and mid range shots that you need someone like Gary(who’s Jrue Holiday level at getting through screens) to stay on the ball handlers hip when they drive and force them to make a decision with Jokic’s massive plodding body standings in front of you and a great defender in Gary on them. Like you said Gary coming back probably saved us vs Utah because we had a guard who could get through screens and let us play defense the way we wanted to. Mitchell couldn’t split the traps or get straight line drives and pull-ups when Jokic dropped every play like games 1-4
PJ Dozier is now our best perimeter defender after G gone
"Jokic  Murray  MPJ  Barton  Gordon  Monte  PJ Dozier  Here’s where it gets tough: do we protect facu, Zeke, or bol? IMO we should go with facu cuz we have a ton of bigs but bol bol’s ceiling is really high"
"Not a superstar, or even an all-star, but PJ Dozier can be a really, really good NBA player if given the chance.  He's one of the best defenders in the league for positions 1-3, he's 6'7"" with a 6'11"" wingspan, is insanely athletic, is a ridiculous rebounder for his size, and has a serviceable 3pt shot and can go to the hole in bench minutes.  Even if his actual offensive scoring isn't that great, there is still value on the offensive side of the ball as he's a really good passer who can usually hit the right man."
PJ Dozier
"That’s true you right. Suns also benefited from the injuries from the teams they faced. Lakers (Lebron on a bad ankle, AD out with a groin) Denver ( No Murray, No PJ Dozier, a kinda healthy Will Barton) Clippers ( No Kawhi, No Ibaka and a drained tired Clippers team ) I actually wanted Utah to win that series because I thought they would’ve gave Phoenix the best matchup and most competitive games. With Mitchell playing how he was and Conley probably being in a better shape than what he was"
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
AJ Lawson is arguably the greatest NBA player since PJ Dozier or Sindarius Thornwell
Pj dozier
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
"As much as I'd like for Barton go get yeeted into the sun, we really thin on the wings. It's only PJ Dozier and Barton, Dozier is more of a big PG. The deal was relatively cheap though and only 2 years so it's OK."
"You know PJ Dozier is on the team, and he's better than either of those shooting guards you listed.  Also listing Bad Bad as depth is laughable.  Also Gordon is our 3, and Porter is our 4.  Also JaMychal Green is a 4."
"Sorry, you're completely wrong. Steve Kerr said it himself, unless you think you know better than him.  &gt; ""You're gonna guard LeBron, you're gonna guard Kawhi, you're gonna guard Luka. We don't have other guys on the roster who can do that so that's your job. Here's what you need to do to do that and we're gonna stay on you.' That plan was executed. Andrew embraced it and really did a good job with it.""   https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-andrew-wiggins-gets-only-one-nba-all-defense-vote  &gt; ""Wiggins defense ranks fifth-best among all small forwards, per ESPN’s Real Plus-Minus.

"See:  Denver starting last year with Murray, Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, PJ Dozier, and Facu and having a starting backcourt of Facu and Austin Rivers come playoff time.  Depth is a wonderful thing to have."
"Even without Murray, Barton does not play the point guard role at all. He primarily plays the shooting guard role, while occasionally going into the pick and roll with Jokic. Monte Morris or Facu are the ones who do the primary ball-handling and distributing when Jokic is not.   Plus the Nuggets team has very few wings. MPJ is their only pure small forward, while you already have Monte, Facu, and PJ Dozier that play the pg role as well."
"Call me a homer but what the 20-21 Nuggets were doing after the AG trade and before Murray got hurt was special. After Murray, the Nuggets lost Barton, then PJ Dozier, and we all know how it went.   Maybe they would have still lost to the Suns, but it probably would’ve been a much more entertaining series at least."
"First Gamecock since PJ Dozier and my hometown's Sindarius Thornwell to make the NBA, let's go!"
Let me introduce you to PJ Dozier
"i dont think ive seen any reasonable non troll say the bucks would have gotten crushed. The bucks are a fucking good team. The suns are a different story, and while they deserved their berth in the finals too, we cant really just ignore the fact that every team they faced this playoffs, including the bucks, had a major injury on their squad.  If bucks had donte divincenzo, its possible that bucks sweep or win in 5, never mind lebron, ad, murray, kawhi, and the plethora of smaller injuries like kcp, schroder, caruso, michael porter jr., pj dozier, serge ibaka, ivica zubac all playing a factor. Suns were the best west team this year because they beat everyone else in the battle of healthiness this year. But its magnitudes easier for most fans to accept bucks as champions because they have proven their quality of team over a longer period of time"
I think he's better leading the bench unit - hoping that PJ Dozier turns into a solid glue guy in the starting lineup
PJ Dozier please
I think we just need to develop more.  PJ Dozier will start for us next year and surprise you guys.  Mpj WILL be an all star
"&gt; You can't say that a borderline all-star and a role player swing the series.  Good chance we won't win but Murray absolutely makes a huge difference.  A known playoff performer lol, a known suns killer would have made the series extremely close.  When Jokic was defended by Ayton well no one else did Jack shit in the series. With the best 2 man game in the league we easily take atleast 2 games.  Pj Dozier is a role player, yes but one that fits a very specific role which we lacked without him - guard defence.  Context matters"
"Literally nothing about what you said is true. What do you mean another back injury? The last one being in college 3 years ago? He literally played every game since then except when he got COVID.  And the Nuggets have great guard rotation, including the best backup PG in the league. You are just living in recency bias last season when Monte, PJ Dozier, Will Barton, and Jamal got injured. Yeah when your top 4 guards go out, any team would suffer."
"I see Jokic being behind Luka, Giannis, and Embiid if all are healthy and none slip in the standings too far, and maybe even LeBron, KD, or Harden depending on. Few factors. He isn't getting worse or anything, he'll just have more competition imo.  And I guess, I just haven't felt good about PJ dozier being on floor throughout his career. Maybe he'll surprise me this season"
"Well Denver was missing Will Barton, Jamal Murray and, Pj Dozier. Barton came back for the last 2 games and played ok but the Nuggets lost their 3 best gaurd defenders and the only 3 other guys that can create their own shot"
Who am I not acknowledging that is a good enough player to affect the outcome of a series sweep? Like Murray might win an extra game or two but who else is making the difference to get them to win the series? PJ Dozier? Get serious
"The bigger issue is us not having any good point of attack defender. You think any center without one unless they are AD, Bam or Giannis are doing anything against these guards?  For reference see how important Gary Harris was in the 2020 Playoffs. Night and day in comparison. PJ Dozier is his replacement and he was injured too"
His best quality. That's why he fit like a glove as our 4th option in those first 10 games after the trade where we went 9-1 and looked so good. Then Murray went down...then Barton...then Morris...then PJ Dozier...and we ended up with a G league guard rotation for the playoffs. Morris came back but was limited. Barton came back mid Suns series and was even more limited.
"Giannis I guess? But KD still went fucking nuts.  Probably someone like Jrue, but I'm actually gonna say PJ Dozier because that man's defense is fucking ridiculous.  Jrue  uhhh.... Giannis I guess  Kawhi+Serge+Danny green apparently  His knees  A really good defensive center like Nurk or Ayton hurt like hell without Murray.  I'm betting it'll be Simmons when they meet up.  Jrue. Duh.  Jrue. Duh.  Kawhi  Jrue or Dort  Jrue or Dort  Jrue or Dort  Probably Kawhi  Embiid / Ayton / Nurk probably  Clutch situations.  Probably someone like Gobert."
"We beat them without PJ Dozier and Barton aswell lol, plus we added Jeff Green"
"We beat the Blazers with PJ Dozier (our best defender), Will Barton and Monte Motris injured lol. Getting them all back + Jeff Green and another offseason for MPJ to get better, we going to suprise people next year, even without Murray"
"We were also missing Barton for part of the series and PJ Dozier, one of our better defensive wings who’s offense was starting to click before he went down with injury"
"he literally looks like a combination of both, just include pj dozier"
And you guys have all the versatile tall people.   Joker. Bol Bol. Zeke Nnaji. Aaron Gordon. PJ Dozier.....  Scary long bois
It wasn’t just Murray though. It was also Barton out for most of the series and PJ Dozier who is one of their best defenders.
"Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Aaron Gordon, PJ Dozier"
I actually totally agree about PJ Dozier. Dude was balling out before he went down with abductor injury. MPJ kinda overshadowed him
" I'll list all the guys that I think are really really underrated (of course not the same level of players) :  DeAndre Hunter : A lot of people think he's just a 3&amp;D, but he's shown some mid range stuff that could translate into low all star type of shot creation already  PJ Dozier : I think he's a high end back up, good defender, good ballhandler, good positional versatility, athletic  Eric Gordon (crazy overpaid tho) : still a guy that can switch well, was very solid defensively in the playoffs every year, can shoot, spot up from deep, can shot create a bit still  Kyle Anderson : his shot is crazy slow and he's unathletic, but other than that he basically is decent or good at everything  Richaun Holmes : the Kings were good with him on the court last year, and were basically the worst defense of all time without him  Derrick White : has shown some impressive shot creation in the bubble, think he's underutilized because he shared the floor with 2 guys who can't shoot and therefore had to take a backseat when he came back from injury"
"PJ Dozier too, honestly Jokic probably had the worst “MVP” campaign I’ve ever seen"
PJ Dozier did it better https://youtube.com/shorts/-va7POryUcY?feature=share
"That's an incredibly myopic decision to make by an NBA head coach. Yes you have the mvp and you know he's dependable so why not run more shit for guys, like PJ Dozier, who you're supposedly trying to develop. Use the regular season to get others going. Malone out here playing tictactoe while other real coaches playing chess."
"Malone said that he is sure that Bones has played himself into the rotation this year. He wouldn't say that if he didn't mean it and hasn't said that for someone he didn't play.  My feeling is that for the first little bit of the season he wants the team to get stabilized with their lineups that would start in the playoffs right this moment. Nuggets will cut it to a 9 man rotation for the playoffs and it would be unlikely that Bones would bump Facu (defense, experience), or Monte when Jamal is back, or PJ.  He most likely wants to get the starters used to playing with Monte as the starter and Will Barton back. He wants to get the bench guys acclimated to having Facu as the PG again, PJ Dozier getting big minutes, both the Greens being our back up bigs, all that.   Additionally he wants to try and get his rotations that he intends to use all season situated, like how to stagger Jokic/Barton/MPJ with the bench unit. That would be made harder by throwing a rookie into the mix who is naturally going to have significant ups and downs as this would be his first foray into real NBA play, game speed, defense, etc. I know we all love Bones and think he will be very good, but it is still a big learning curve especially on defense and if your normal players aren't playing up to par it is made that much harder.  Once the team is stabilized and the players who are going to play big minutes all season no matter what (Starters, Greens, PJ) are situated in their rolls and playing well (only Jokic has played well in both games, Jokic laid into the team a week ago saying that everyone was just running around, didn't know the plays, was sloppy) then it becomes significantly easier to throw Bones in there.   Until then the priority has to be getting the meat of the team into their roles and playing good basketball."
"Why do all the Celtics 15th men go on to become decent rotation players elsewhere? And why can't we keep any of these guys who would clearly be better than many of our current options?   Abdel Nader, PJ Dozier, Max Strus, and now Javonte Green."
If he can stay healthy-- you all gonna awaken to how good of a role player PJ Dozier is
Lol this package couldn’t even get PJ Dozier
"Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, Will Barton, Bones Hyland… Nuggets are deep at guard if all of them don’t die at the same time. There is a good chance Rivers hardly sees the floor this year."
"Nah, sorry that is bullshit.  I agree that the Raptors most likely don't win if the Warriors dont get decimated.  But last year was a real outlier for playoff team injuries, particularly important/star players.  Just off the top of my head:  Clippers: - Kawhi Leonard (best player on team) out injured  Lakers - LeBron and AD out or dealing with injuries   Nuggets - Jamal Murray, Will Barton, PJ Dozier  Nets - Crippled Harden playing on one leg, Kyrie out.  Hawks - Trae Young tweaks ankle in game three against Bucks  Jazz - Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out or dealing with injuries.  All the serious contenders suffered injuries to one or more of their most important players.  The Bucks did great and earned that ring. But to suggest that injuries played no part is dishonest rubbish."
"Nah. The bigger issue was that we were missing our starting backcourt AND PJ Dozier who an elite and versatile perimeter defender.  Ayton is underrated and probably deserves a max. And yes, his defense is elite. But MPJ just put up the most efficient season a high volume scorer has had since Wilt in his SECOND season. Yes, right now he is more of a Klay-- but if he just improves his handle (which he reportedly worked on all summer) and gets some mid-post moves (ditto), his ceiling is a much, much more efficient, better rebounding Carmelo.  And he is a gym rat who wants to be great. Him putting in the work is not a question.  Are there still questions about his long term fit with Jokic? Sure. But whether he deserved the max should not be-- unless you are really, really worried about his back. But I think the Nuggets medical team probably knows more than you on that."
"Look if you have evidence that PJ Dozier, the PJ Dozier who shot 31% from 3 and 63% from the FT line while being statistically below average in every defensive metric last year is a viable shooting guard then I need it.   I like PJ as a hustle guy and he has a framework I would like to see further developed but there is actually nothing about him when I'm looking right now that makes me think ""this guy is a really good bench player"" nonetheless a totally viable starter"
"The Nuggets will absolutely blame Will Barton as always. If you're a Nugs fan you already know. Plus they just locked him up as starting scapegoat for the next 3 years.  Honestly with Murray out and MPJ having to take a huge leap as secondary option when he has mostly been a spot up shooter, I wouldn't be surprised one bit if Barton got booed at home AGAIN as the fans call for fucking PJ Dozier to start"
"Yeah it's Raptors / Nuggets. Look at OG's progress as a player. Or PJ Dozier with the Nuggets.  Ironically, Masai was Denver's GM before Tim Connelly."
PJ Dozier understood the assignment. MPJ…did his best.
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
PJ Dozier wasn’t drafted by the nuggets he went undrafted and has small stints with the thunder and Celtics. Definitely taken a step up with the nuggets
"You might get downvoted for saying Bol Bol but fr every draft they get an impact player. PJ Dozier, RJ Hampton and now Bones all look like they can stick in a rotation in 2-3 years time"
PJ Dozier &gt; Anyone else in the history of basketball
"Barton played all but one game, and played well at roughly normal minutes. I have no idea what Monte Morris injury you're talking about *or* what AG injury - I must have missed something so if you want to link to an injury report for something please do, I can't find anything on that.  &gt; and the 7th guard to start the season was the lead guard (Facu) in the playoffs  It looks like Facu had played the 5th most minutes out of any Nugget player in the regular season, *and* was good in the series. It's a bit much to complain about being 'forced' to play Campazzo.  Anyway, I said it in another comment, but if you want to count ticky tack stuff and playing through injuries then you have to credit CP3 with his injuries in the series. I'm not pretending that Denver was only missing Jamal, but sorry if I'm not bringing up PJ Dozier as a piece that swings a comfortable sweep into a Nuggets series win."
"Some generous language here - they were 'missing' Will Barton for 1 game then he played well on roughly his average minutes, MPJ was also playing albeit on limited minutes, and PJ Dozier was a bench player who averaged ~20 minutes in the regular season. If you really want to add up all the ticky tack stuff to change a dominant sweep into a win you're confident in for the other side, then you have to include CP3 playing through his injuries and pretty soon you're dealing with movements too small to account for how dominant the Suns were that series."
"Except Denver didn't have their 2nd option (Murray), best defender (PJ Dozier), while their 4th option was on limited minutes from game 2 (Barton).  Suns fans act like it was only Murray, but it was far from that, Nuggets were banged up completely and beat Portland without all those three above with Jokic carrying like crazy. Then MPJ was probable for game 3 and 4, and they gave up."
"Not even just the core locked up but we've also locked up our primary bench pieces (Monte Morris and PJ Dozier), we've got control of the majority of our future draft picks, and we still have intriguing young talent like Bol Bol and, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji.  Tim Connolly still has all the firepower to swing for a huge trade without even having to touch one of Murray, Jokic, or MPJ."
"And I’m super happy about it, mostly because I disagree heavily with your criticisms of those players.  In terms of the surrounding cast, you’re always going to have role players on smaller deals surrounding your max players on any contending team. Denver happens to be very good at finding and developing talent through the draft/udfas/2-way contracts etc. Monte Morris, PJ dozier, Torrey Craig, Terence Davis, Kendrich Williams we’re all 2 way guys our FO found just in the past few years."
"I mean that's pretty damn debatable - it seems rather like you either dont watch much Nuggets if ever, or you just believe scoring is all that matters for offense given you just keep saying he scored many points. But - Jokic is one of the two best midrange shooters in the NBA statistically (along with one Kevin Durant - this has been the case since Jokic entered the league as well), and shoots from there quite frequently (and while I'm not going to go track down where their shots came from overall in the playoffs, in round 1 Kawhi shot 40 3s over 7 games - Jokic shot 35 3s in 6 games - the point is that your ""paint vs midrange"" is not really that significant, given that Jokic was literally the team's only person capable of regularly handling the ball at times in the playoffs, and how much each team sold out to stop him - all of his shots are contested too, for the most part). So, all that to say: Against Portland Jokic averaged 33 ppg on 53/43/92, without the Nuggets whole regular guard rotation except Monte Morris, and without his second best player. I'd argue 33 ptspg on those efficiency numbers with only one of your top 4 guards playing &gt; 30 ppg with a fully healthy roster, personally. Also worth noting that the Mavs have uh... exactly zero good defensive players to put on Kawhi and PG. The Blazers meanwhile matched Nurkic to Jokic's minutes and it's worth noting that when Nurkic played last year, Portland defended at a top 10-11 level. So there's that.   Jokic wore down against the Suns shooting very poorly compared to all his previous playoff series, but still averaged 25 ppg... and while Will Barton played the last 3 games of that series he was clearly still hobbled, and the Nuggets still were without Murray and their best perimeter defender in PJ Dozier - the Suns basically loaded up to stop Jokic because the Nuggets had literally no one else who could handle the ball and reliably punish them.   Jokic and Kawhi's assist numbers in round 1 are also in fact nearly identical, except one of them was playing without his second best player and the rest of his starting and backup guard rotation.  OH! And while Jokic's efficiency went way down against PHX, Kawhi's also went down against Utah. He didnt shoot 60% for this whole playoff run. Against Utah he averaged 27, 7 and 4 on 50 (still really good!), 33 (much less good), 84.   That all said, I'd be curious what Kawhi might average without PG13, Reggie Jackson, Terence Mann, and whomever else would work as the last guard. He might average a similar amount of points. Might even still be really efficient. I'd be willing to bet not as efficient though, and likely with fewer assists. But it's not even a fair comparison really given the Clippers were *healthy* in the playoffs, until Kawhi got hurt.   Last - Steph Curry conserves his energy on offense? WHAT? Have you ever uh... watched Steph? Or did you mean on defense? If you meant on defense, that might be true (though I dont think in the playoffs you can really do that), but *we aren't talking about defense*. Literally just offense."
"they can probably get a dpe, they have to apply for one by mid-January and at the time of application doctors (assigned by the league) have to agree his injury is season-ending (out till after the playoffs), which seems doable.  but the dpe is only good for 50% of his $5.3M salary, it has to be utilized by sometime in spring, and can only be for a 1-year contract of they get an FA or trading for a guy in the last year of their contract.  and they'd have to waive or trade someone to free up a roster spot (pj dozier is the only non-guaranteed guy so i dunno if that's really an easy call).  but yeah, they probably can't get anyone really high-impact for a mpj dpe that they couldn't just get as a min signing."
MPJ is thought to be out for the seaon but no confirmation Jokic should be back soon. Pj Dozier out for the seaon with an acl tear.
PJ Dozier has been playing without an ACL for yrs
I don't think PJ Dozier really affect how Jokic will be seen. The others sure.
"but they can just sign a vet min outright.  this is only helpful if they use it for a trade, but they already have 2 bigger trade exceptions available (expiring 2/11).  dpe's provide no tax relief or anything either, and it doesn't free up a roster spot.  (they're like $1.5M below the luxury tax threshold.)  sadly, their only non-guaranteed contract is pj dozier himself.  maybe they just ride with this roster."
OKC let PJ Dozier wear #35 after KD left
"Jokic, Jamal, and MPJ are all out, our rookie Bones is out, Barton is having nagging injuries again, and today PJ dozier just blew out his knee"
andddd PJ dozier is out. i feel so bad for y’all man
Or the great PJ Dozier
Wait? So you think PJ Dozier is turning a easy sweep into a series win? Lmao the delusion.
"I've never seen someone dominate PJ Dozier and Monte Morris so thoroughly. By 6 points!  MVP? Nay, GOAT!"
GODDAM HE REALLY SHOWED PJ DOZIER WHOSE BOSS!!!  HANG THE BANNER
"&gt;If you use last season too, KD definitely wouldn’t have an argument. The gap was larger last year.  Objectively incorrect. Keep in mind we’re talking about their scoring specifically.  KD last season - 26.9 ppg on 66.6 TS%  Jokic - 26.4 ppg on 64.7 TS%  &gt;Yes, Jokic’s positional advantage matters more than 30ppg. That’s why Jokic at 19ppg was more impactful than Bradley Beal at 30. I don’t think you understand the concept of replacement value.  Objectively incorrect. Jokic was roughly a similar caliber player as Beal that season, and that’s largely due to his passing closing the large gap in scoring.  &gt;Yeah, Denver has so many elite defensive players around jokic. Name 2?  Aaron Gordon and PJ Dozier."
"So why does him being a great interior defender matter, if teams can abuse the shit out of his perimeter defense and destroy them in playoffs? Also you are trying to prove your point with suns sweep when Nuggets were missing half of their roster, including second best player and insane playoff performer in Murray, arguably the third best scorer in Barton, and PJ Dozier, all of whom are huge defensive upgrades compared to the starting lineup in Suns series, especially PJ dozier. Why are you not talking about for example Jazz and Clippers series from 2020? What happened to great defensive players in Gobert, Kawhi, Pg, If Jokic is that bad of a defender and easily exploited, Nuggets shouldnt even stand a chance in playoffs, right? Guess what, it didnt matter that their start players were better defensive players, Nuggets did more against ""good"" defenders than they were ever able to benefit from Jokic being a ""bad"" defender. Im not saying that Jokic is a great defender, your arguments are just so shit that it actually makes me cringe. But i can understand that you as a Rockets fan have nothing better to do after Hardens departure but to cry and hate on other star players with arguments  that you pulled out of your ass."
"Also Jokic looks like he's actually a good defender now due to his own improvement and internal changes for the Nuggets (starting a healthy Thrill at the 2 instead of the 3, adding AG who helps at the rim, having PJ Dozier in lineups with him instead of Facu), which really was the best argument Embiid had last season."
PJ Dozier played with 1 ACL until he graduated high school
"No offense to Pacers fans but I do think Sabonis is currently overrated due to everything going through him he is budget Jokic, but you dont really need to double him cause his scoring is not on that level. What your staff needs to do is to find out defence in which Sabonis is not bad and play it, just like Nuggets do with Jokic. Jokic doesnt switch much he kinda plays ball and disrupts on pick until his man recovers and they slow down pnr.   It is no knock on Sabonis, Jokic would suck too(like he did in playoffs) without good guard/wing defenders that can recover from behind like Will Barton, PJ Dozier, Jamal or Gordon who can stay in fron of everyone without getting pushed."
Something about PJ Dozier makes me go “oh hey that’s PJ Dozier” whenever I see him.   Don’t know why.
"No scorers and almost no chemistry. Before you had Will Barton and Monte Morris off the bench who are both facilitators who can score, now they're in the starting line up. Now you have Campazzo, Rivers, PJ Dozier and two Greens. That's not bad on paper but that means the main playmaker is Campazzo who's great at passing but isn't a scoring threat so NBA defenses can easily play around his weaknesses.     If Bones keeps playing as well as he's playing, he could potentially be the 6th man in his rookie season which is unprecedented for Malone. Nuggets fans are all for it."
"What, last year? We were not only missing the butter to our bread, but we we were missing Will Barton and PJ dozier. We were starting rookie Facundo Campazzo and out of the league Austin Rivers. The year before that we did go to the wcf."
