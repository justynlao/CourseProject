Jeremiah Robinson-Earl. He'll come out this year and go 10 spots too late just like every other Nova guy does.
"Nova fan here. We all knew Bridges/Bey/Paschall would outperform their spots just like we knew Spellman went way too high. Hart went about the right spot, he's just not long enough. Basically everyone drafted from Villanova plays 10 years, remember Dante Cunningham?  If you want the next LeBron, don't draft a Nova guy. If you want a smart wing that does all the little things, come on down.  Come back to this thread in 4 years when Jeremiah Robinson-Earl is an all-star."
"I was really hoping Danny would pick Saddiq Bey at 14 essentially just because he played at 'Nova which is basically a guarantee that a player will at least be serviceable in the league.  I think Nesmith will figure it out long-term, but Bey really felt like an obvious move.  I haven't even seen Jeremiah Robinson-Earl play but fuck it, I'm jumping on his hype train lol.  Jay Wright is phenomenal at developing players in that college-to-NBA pipeline."
"Bol Bol, Jeremiah Robinson Earl, Dean Wade"
Too high  9. Jeremiah Robinson Earl 11. Ayo Dosunmu 12. Chris Duarte   Too low 26. Moses Moody 27. Jaden Springer   Come on
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
Jeremiah Robinson-Earl is gonna make an All-Rook team.
"Idk, I'm pretty convinced that Jeremiah Robinson-Earl will be the next Anthony Davis"
"I think an interesting one from this is that most people would say Barnes and Greg Brown are taller than Jeremiah Robinson Earl, but they're not"
Hold me to this: Jeremiah Robinson-Earl is going to be really good in the NBA.  Still wish he was a Sun :(
What do we know about Jeremiah Robinson Earl Knicks fans help me
"I'm sorry why the fuck is Jeremiah Robinson-Earl being picked at 32 when so many talented players are on the board, much less why did OKC trade up for him using their 34/36 to go up 2 spots?! Robinson-Earl is fucking terrible. OKC draft has been a bit of a disaster, though I'm relatively high on Giddey"
Josh Primo will be Caris Levert level of impact   Tre Mann will be an all star level player    Bones Hyland is going to be at least a 15 ppg scorer in the league. I genuinely think you take him top 20 and wouldn’t be mad at anyone in the back half of the lotto   Jeremiah Robinson Earl will slip and be such an immediate impact people will be like how could we let another villanova guy slip.   I agree with your Santi Aldama pick but I’m going to one up it and say Sandro Mamukelishvili is going to be an impact offensive player off the bench immediately. The guy is an NBA player hands down. He’s Bobby Portis with slightly more playmaking flare
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Šarić and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn’t trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
"The answer has to be Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, but maybe that one isn't so surprising (he had a lot of buzz)."
Nobody is typing Jeremiah Robinson-Earl everytime man its more of just a typing thing that transferred into real life haha.
"JRE isn’t even that catchy. Not like KCP or MKG or CP3 or PG13, etc. I feel like the abbreviation as a nickname only works when it’s cooler sounding than the person’s actual name, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl is a pretty damn nice name."
Jeremiah Robinson-Earl. His father beat Kobe Bryant in a high school dunk contest back then.
Jeremiah Robinson-Earl. Rookie out of Villanova.
Build around Jeremiah Robinson-Earl
Holding onto my Jeremiah Robinson-Earl stock
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."

Jeremiah Robinson Earl  Don’t except anyone outside of OKC fans to know
"1. Quickley has surprised a lot of people with how well he's played. To say that OKC punted on building by not picking a player that was drafted in the 20's and wasn't projected to be this good at the time of the draft is silly.  2. Taking Poku was a huge swing, which as a fan of a rebuilding team I am fully in favor of. High upside guys are what I'd like to see us draft and then hope the OKC development team js able to bring some of that potential to fruition. I don't think a lot of OKC fans feel as though that was a bad pick.  3. Sengun projects to be a good player. I think he's going to be solid at least. It does not do OKC any favors at all to pass on good players intentionally. Why would they do that? You think they wouldn't like to skip steps on the rebuilding process and get back to the point of contention? Of course they would. What makes the most sense is they didn't think Sengun's value was higher than that of two first rounders going forward. And perhaps they were just that high on Jeremiah Robinson Earl! They traded up to pick him early in the second round and he's projecting to fill a role that Sengun would have filled as well. Check out their stats in comparison. They're looking pretty similar and JRE is going to be a better defender.  4. I sincerely believe that within the current structure of the NBA the way small market teams can maintain success in today's NBA is by drafting great players. We could blow our load on trades for good role players and maybe an All-Star but we literally did that 3 years ago to the tune of 2 first round exits. The Thunder want to build a true contender with prolonged success and you do that by drafting great players. This is not a Ponzi scheme, this is short selling the housing market and waiting for the payout. All the Thunder and Shai and the fans have to do is be patient."

"Our second-round rookie this season, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, just screams ""beloved bench role player.""  He's a 6'9"" 230+lb forward/center who is comfortable on the switch (there's a viral video of him defending James Harden which ends in Harden taking a tightly contested stepback three with a hand in his face and then falling to the floor trying to bait a foul call), actively sets screens on-and-off ball, has great positioning, and is ninth among rookies in 3PT made while shooting 37% from three. (1.1 3PM to 3.1 3PA per game)  He's also, by all accounts, a stand-up dude and super mature for a 21 year old and has the best chemistry with Josh Giddey on the team. Giddey's finding him for open layups every game.  His weakness is that he's not a super athlete, so he's not a lob finisher or rim protector, which probably sets his ceiling as a role player that defends intelligently, spaces the floor, and positions himself for easy looks."

"Players basketball reference lists as centers who take more than that per game: 17 (KAT, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Horford, Jokic, Bamba, Olynyk, Vucevic, Wendell Carter, Jr., Muscala, Sabonis, Theis, Mo Wagner, Bjelica, Jeff Green, Anthony Davis, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl)  And that's just on a per-game basis - if we did per 36 I'm sure that number would be significantly higher.  I'm not trying to disrespect Valanciunas - he's a good player - it just never made sense that people were claiming that he's a floor-spacing 5"
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."

"Seeing that salary just reminded me what a wizard Sam Presti is. Gave Russ a huge contract as the face of the franchise, once his decline started, traded him, rehabbed Chris Paul, then traded him too.  So, in all, in exchange for Russell Westbrook, the Thunder ultimately have ended up with: Poku, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Ty Jerome, and FOUR MORE FIRST ROUNDERS (Suns 2022 pick, and Rockets 2024 &amp; 2026 picks and 2025 swap). All for Russ to turn into an albatross contract nobody wants."
