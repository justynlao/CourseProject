Justin champagnie. Athletic quick shooting is improving big time excellent defender with lateral quickness good rebounder also. It’s not his fault his teammates chose to be felons and a few others found the I in team and flat out quit
Do Khem Birch (he could be a birch tree) and Scottie Barnes (he could be a barn).   Toronto also has a guy named Justin Champagnie (he could be just in champagne).
"So I think that gives the raptors their 15+2:   Dragic (for now), FVV, OG, Pascal, Birch  Flynn, GTJ, Barnes, Yuta, Boucher  Banton, Wainright, Dekker, Precious, Gillespie   2W: Justin Champagnie, David Johnson"
They haven't been very relevant unfortunately nowadays other than Steven Adams and former Duke Assistant HC Jeff Capel. There is Justin Champagnie on a 2-way deal with the Raptors but that's about it
Justin Champagnie will be a top 10 player from this draft class
What’s your thoughts on Justin champagnie? Will he be a sneaky late round steal or a solid bench unit guy
Justin Champagnie is the flyest name I've seen in a long time. Can he ball though?
"The only injured team the raps faced was the Warriors and KD was already out the entire playoffs so his doesn't count. Klay played most of the series and got injured game 4 or 5 can't remember.   That raps team had one of the toughest roads to the finals in recent memory, you're super trippin. The best Philly team in decades (Jimmy, Embiid, Simmons, Harris and Horford), the bucks with mvp Giannis + Middleton, and then the Warriors.  Compare that to the Lakers run in the bubble and the bucks run and it's not even close. Both of those teams had a cakewalk compared to the Raptors.   As for the team's rep it's the best it's ever been. Young players are hyped to be apart of the organization. Scottie Barnes was super excited to be drafted by Toronto, and Justin Champagnie turned down multiple offers from like half the league to come to Toronto because of our development program and winning culture. Btw DeMar forgave Masai last year for that trade and they had a long chat in the bubble. So again, the rep of the team is the best it's ever been.  Hella weird that you're from sauga and hating on the Raptors, but hey do you lol. None of what you said is remotely true though, not even in the slightest."
Justin Champagnie.  OG is rightfully getting his due for his leaps made in the preseason but I think Justin will surprise a lot of even avid Raptors watchers given he went undrafted.  Dude's a double double machine.
Hey now that's not the only rookie on the raps!  Justin Champagnie has looked great in his limited minutes. Terrific rebounder
"Dalano ""Justin Champagnie"" Banton"
