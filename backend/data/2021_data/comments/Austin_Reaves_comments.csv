Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves &gt; Cunningham
Austin Reaves from OU is legit a better prospect and I could see him going over Cade
Cade isn’t good. Got clamped up by Elijah Harkless. Gimme Austin Reaves over him all day
Idk how it works but I read Austin reaves and ayayi dropped out of the draft to sign with the Lakers.
"Man shot 100% on 6 threes, did all the little things, made some GREAT passes, and locked up Austin Reaves. Love to see it"
McClung didn't even look that great. He tried to do way too much to begin the game and played into the criticisms about him. Strange that they signed him this early into Summer League.   Thank god they already signed Austin Reaves though. Dude is going to be a walking role-player bucket.
Does this leave any room for Austin Reaves? Dude is a baller
HERE COMES AUSTIN REAVES
Here comes Austin Reaves.
Also signed Austin Reaves and Joel Ayayi to two way contracts.
Austin Reaves
"if the Lakers dont pack the bench with vet guards who need minutes, I wouldn't be surprised if Austin Reaves legit carves out like a 8-12 mpg role in the regular season. He was one of my favorite 2nd round targets pre-draft."
Austin Reaves is the only guy I really like on it
"Slightly more excited about Austin Reaves, but both of this guys are gonna play way more in the G league than the regular season."
"Damn, thought they'd go Austin Reaves. Guess we'll see in a couple years if this dude comes over. Definitely a stash."
I swear to God I'm going to need an inhaler if the Celtics choose Austin Reaves over BJ Boston or Sharife Cooper lmao
Austin Reaves.
"All three of them will perform well and then Austin Reaves will go second round and be better than them and once again, getting your old guy later will continue to be preached."
"Cade Cunningham.  But they're picking 45th, so prob Austin Reaves or Herb Jones or something."
For a little bigger picture:  https://go.nba.com/7vs9   Only two players on the Lakers have a positive +/- per 36. Austin Reaves and Malik Monk
Future 10 time champion Austin Reaves will help make this a reality.
Who the fuck is Austin Reaves?
Austin Reaves looks like his favorite song of all time is Never Meant by American Football
AuStIn ReAvEs RoY
"Lakers fans acting like Austin Reaves is the key to their problems, lmao tf??"
"I'm guessing by the username: LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Carmelo, THT, Austin Reaves, Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn (when they come back), Wayne Ellington, and LeBron again."
Blame Vogel for not playing Austin Reaves.
"Trade AD and LeBron, build around Russ and Austin Reaves"
My only hope is THT gets traded for somebody. He’s making 10 mil. I’ve watched him make the same mistakes over and over. I watched Austin reaves play 3 games and the IQ is night and day he’s so smart I would play him over THT. Sad.
"The only players with the ability to impact the game I’ve seen so far are   Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Dwight, Monk, Ellington, and Melo . Austin Reaves has also been good but they aren’t deep at all."
"As A long time Lebron stan...can't watch lakers games, this product is so bad. DeAndre needs to be banished into the Shadow Retirement Realm. Give his minutes to Austin Reaves.      Then move WBs ass to bench for Ellington/Monk/Nunn. Russ was actually....decent? today but he would look so much better playing bulk of his minutes vs opposite benches.       AD....fooled us with few good games and now he's back to being a regular season pumpkin, when Metu and Corpse of Marvin Bagley outrun/work/hustle you, I have nothing for you.      Ben Simmons for Lebron offer still stands, we'll throw all the 1st round picks in as well.      Edit: Forgot about Lebron.....maybe not let Harkless cut behind you all day every day? I miss last 2 years defense, I guess my out of Philly fandom follows Alex to the Bulls now. Bandwagoners, ASSEMBLE"
"What happened to Austin Reaves? I legit think he would make a huge difference. Reminds me a lot of Caruso, smart on defense, hustles, energizes team"
"At this point, the only thing that keeps me watching the Lakers is for Austin Reaves lol."
"I love the tweet on the front page about LeBron, AD, and *checks notes* 0MPG Austin Reaves coming back in"
HERE COMES AUSTIN REAVES
Austin Reaves and who?
yeah what the fuck.  should have been Austin Reaves at #22...
Austin Reaves
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Honestly Austin reaves. He’s better than Caruso was as a rookie. Shot blocker would obviously be Dwight. On ball defender for small guards Avery Bradley, but all around it has to be reaves"
Austin Reaves
Why was he asked about austin reaves
Hush Alex Austin Reaves just dunked on someone in the South Bay Lakers scrimmage
lmao so true. Lakers fans were doing their hardest to make Austin Reaves the next Caruso.
Bron  AD  THT  Melo  Dwight  AB  Austin Reaves  Rondo  take anyone else
"Austin Reaves has done more good than quite a few of the other players on the roster, I'll tell you that"
nah the fanbase did that already by photoshopping anyone with a pulse into a lakers jersey and calling fucking austin reaves a good player
The disrespect to Austin Reaves
"Austin Reaves, lmao"
"For some reason, Austin Reaves was included and he is now a child"
"If he can give you 20-25 minutes a night, then it will improve the defense. Injuries force the other role players to play more minutes than they should. It’s not necessarily the guy behind him, but it’s the 3rd and 4th guys who are forced to play out of position and out of their roles. Examples are when you are forced to play Austin Reaves big minutes at the 3 and make an already slow footed Melo play extended minutes."
Austin Reaves is our one and true savior
"lakers don't have the goat austin reaves, though!"
"I’ve been in Lakers Reddit too much lmao. I read this is as “Austin Reaves” at first and was like “um, what kind of meme is this”."
"That is a fair point, I'm just going to stick with minutes though. I think switching to FGA as the barrier to entry won't change much about the chart if anything at all. Also I'm not sure there is that strong of a relationship between low volume and higher efficiency. Yes you have Mamu and Garza at the top, but at the same time Butler, Moody, and Christopher are at the bottom.  That being said Austin Reaves has been playing 20mpg and is far from barely playing, Mamukelashvili fits your argument better."
Couple years younger than Austin Reaves
His name is Austin Reaves
"It's clear that Pelinka's 2019-20 moves had great results. They were in a tough position after having waited for Kawhi but they ended up with a fantastic roster that ended up proving to be the best in the league.  However, with hindsight after looking at what he's done since, it appears that was more luck than a coherent team building philosophy. He was basically forced into signing those roleplayers (even Dwight was only signed after Cousins got injured again), and they fortuitously cohered together.  What we're seeing now is Pelinka's real strategy: go after big names that people know, regardless of fit, team chemistry, or basketball IQ. Instead of just running a championship team back, he's systematically gutted it. Just 2 seasons later, all they're left with other than Bron and AD is Rondo (who's pretty washed), Dwight (who's useful in his role but very limited), and THT (who played almost no role in their chip run). That's very unusual and harkens back to the post-2011 Mavs, not a comparison any chip winner should want.  Now, the Lakers still have extremely good talent evaluation, as we've seen again with Austin Reaves, and it's hard to know how much to blame Pelinka when we all know LeBron is calling a lot of the shots (and Buss is to blame for losing Caruso). But by the same token, if you're not going to blame him when things go wrong, you can't credit him when things go well."
Who Austin reaves? Lol. When lebron comes back things will change. But this team doesn’t look like a championship team as they have been billed rn. Lebron coming back doesn’t fix the defense. Granted they prob make some trades etc later
"In this scenario, couldn't you trade away KCP and sign Caruso in his place?   Then it would be $18M for 9 spots and leave the last spot open since you wouldn't need Avery Bradley with Caruso there. Most of your other spots have been spent on vet mins anyways and you have Austin Reaves who's cheaper than the vet min."
"you can fill out the team with min guys if they're all 0-years-of-service like austin reaves, actually. XD  he's just under $1M a year.  but that would probably be pretty bad.  actually the hardcap is $143M this year, $136M is the luxury tax threshold.  so that's like $18M for 10 guys (you can do just 9, too), i guess it's possible.  but you might not get nunn on the MLE for that.  it's pretty tight."
Man Lakers need to waive Bazemore and just go with Monk and Austin Reaves or something.
I would have liked to keep caruso but to me we betting on THT upside and what he could be and plus the Lakers are good at drafting i know yall see Austin Reaves out there looking like a Lil Caruso #Lakeshow
He's 2.5 years younger than Austin Reaves. Yet this is his 3rd season and Reaves is a rookie
"&gt;  at a discount. You could have saved money on players like DeAndre Jordan to keep him.  This bit is nonsense. AC was offered 4/37 by the Bulls, and even with  discount, he isnt getting less than 3/27  While DeAndre is costing the Lakers $1.6 m (League picks up the rest of the vet minimum)  Lakers might have kept that 15th spot open, if they had Caruso (instead of going for AB), but at best that's $3.2 m vs $9m or over 3x that if you factor in tax.  Plus in one sense, AC's replacement is Austin Reaves who is a very chep contract (~800- 900 K)   There's no universe in which the Lakers would have saved money by picking Caruso (on top of THT)   This is a different argument from saying it would have been worth it, BTW"
When you add Austin Reaves at less than $1 million that's a good young 4 off the bench for cheap.
Caruso vs Austin Reaves
"&gt;Same thing happened to Ingram, Lonzo, and Hart.   And D'Lo, Randle, Caruso, Clarkson, Nance, Zubac, etc. It's currently happening with THT and probably will start with Austin Reaves soon, but hopefully the Lakers hold on to them so we don't have to keep seeing this pattern repeated like this."
"God I hate people who talk shit when clearly not knowing anything about basketball. Heat ran almost always a switch-all defense. Lakers do not. If you can’t force a switch then a guy being an exploitable on-ball defender isn’t nearly as big of an issue. Off-ball he’s fine/good.  And yes, Austin Reaves is a good defender."
"Well said. A lot of the guys on the roster doesn't know how to defense. Monk, Ellington, Westbrook. Austin Reaves is the only guy that puts in the effort. I give Melo a pass doe he is a sixth man and his job is to score. Anything else is a bonus."
I’m taking Austin Reaves over prime CPoop3
Austin Reaves is good
and Austin Reaves is undrafted rookie that is basically counted as a homegrown talent
"I feel like undrafted players should count, especially if they've never played for another team but yours. Like Austin Reaves"
"Austin is actually p good though chill lol we hype up our people and when they leave they show they’re actually good, we hyped up Caruso, y’all thought he was overhyped with no offense, boom he’s good now. Kuzma was a “diva” and “trash” now he’s good too. Reaves is actually p good as well lol plus you guys act like every other team doesn’t do the same with a good role player / rook"
"My dumb brain refuses to read ""Reaves"" correctly and insists its ""Rivers"" when it sees the name ""Austin Reaves"" written out like that. Please send help."
"I am also upset I won’t get to see Austin Reaves play, was really looking forward to that matchup"
"Except this is largely affecting the youngest players on the team.   Talent Horton-Tucker: 20 years old (hasn't yet played)  Austin Reaves: 23 years old   Kendrick Nunn: 26 years old (hasn't yet played)  Ariza's injury you can chalk up to age, but it sounds like LeBron and Rondo will probably be back soon. Old guys missing a game here or there with minor injuries is to be expected. What hasn't been expected was all the young guys (except for Monk) missing significant time as well."
"&gt;2). Austin Reaves, LAL - 34.9%  &gt;10). Alex Caruso, CHI - 37.9%  suck it Laker haters"
"Austin ""Alex Caruso"" Reaves"
Austin “ always on leave” reaves
"This hurts the Lakers unironically. Austin Reaves played amazing relative to his talent and expectations like he does all the little things that make up winning basketball. He’s no Whattaburger or Ky Bowman, he’s actually kinda solid."
Reaves and Austin
You mean Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves 2.0 some would say
"I think we should wait to be healthy. There are some good things and not so good things. Melo is doing great, austin reaves is a nice surprise, D12 has been solid and AD looking like 2019. All this without key parts of the rotation. The thing that concerns me the most is Russ. He seems like stopped chucking shots, but now he is chucking layups. Poor effort on defense. We sometimes look better with rondo out there and that's a no-no. But hey, it's a long seasons, as long as we get healthy to playoffs, we have a shot."
"Westbrook being a disaster (for now) has gotten the whole attention (rigthfully so he's on a max contract), but besides Melo every other signing has been pretty bad, DJ is terrible on defense, Dwight is really becoming a liability on offense, Bradley and Bazemore basically ignore that defense is not only on the ball, Monk has been atrocious on defense and inconsistent, Rondo has been Rondo.  You can make a real argument that Austin Reaves has been a top 5 player on that roster.  You can hope for Russ to be better (altough it's not because he has sucked at the start of every season and turned it around that it will happen every year), and Ellington/Ariza/THT/Nunn will take away some of the bad players mins, but that feels like a lot of wasted roster spots, even for minimum contracts"
"Tonight Rondo was ejected for hitting someone in the head unintentionally. Austin Reaves was hit in the head (harder perhaps) earlier in the game, and it was a common foul. This being said: As a Laker fan, I have to disagree.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Still, Harden finally getting called out for his blatant bullshit is like a wet dream"
The power of Carmelo and Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves is this years budget Caruso. Ugly win but we needed it. I’m hopeful though I think things are starting to gel.
He should be a 6th man at this point. Rondo better. Austin Reaves better.
"and austin reaves what, fifth?  what a story"
The mafia has Austin Reaves family
Austin reaves aint no kennard
Is Carmelo the Lakers third best offensive player? Wtf.  Also why not just start Austin Reaves at this point?
Austin Reaves sounded like an Anime character going up for the rebound.
Seriously though I know a Mexican barber on Figueroa that would bring Austin Reaves into the 21st century.
"Holy fuck. Austin Reaves is from a town of 1,000 people. And now he's playing at Staples in LA. Unreal."
can someone get Austin Reaves a damn barber? does no one in LA care about this man?
Start Austin Reaves you cowards
Lakers should trade everyone and build around Melo and Austin Reaves
Austin reaves what a beast
"They actually should have kept Markief Morris also (who wanted to return on a min deal) and signed another wing for defense like James Ennis or Wes Matthews.  They had Austin Reaves on a 2 way contract so there was no actual need to use a roster spot to sign him to the team.   Front orifice messed up over the course of the year.   Imagine....  Lowry, Nunn, Caruso Hield, Bazemore, Monk Ariza, Ennis, Matthews (or Avery Bradley) LeBron, Morris, Anthony AD, Howard, DJ"
"lakers barely have any tradable contracts now, too.  like last year they only had enough to make two big moves at most (wound up just being 1).  unless they blow it up and move lebron or AD, they only have THT.  nunn has a PO, if this year goes badly enough maybe he just goes to rehab his value on another team (or if he doesn't ding his own value that much this year maybe he gets offered more than $5.25M by another team and just leaves).  austin reaves might turn out to be incredible but his contract is only worth $1.56M next year."
Send him to OKC with someone who is worth picks like THT or maybe austin reaves
"&gt;This team is stacked with veterans, like literally only veterans.  Austin Reaves, NBA veteran."
we all know that austin reaves got that golden retriever energy
"If someone in the off-season had said ""let me put together a lineup made up exclusively of players on vet minimum contracts and Russell Westbrook"" how good would anyone have expected that team to be? Because other than the 7 minutes AD played tonight, that's exactly what the lineup was.   The Lakers have five players who are making more than the minimum this year, and four of them combined to play 7 minutes tonight. The other one was Russell Westbrook. Everyone else is hurt or had a stomach flu. The Lakers are absolutely decimated by injuries right now, but for whatever reason nobody seems to be aware of it or willing to acknowledge it.   Tonight both of the Lakers two-way players played. They also played their undrafted rookie, Austin Reaves (who only has $100k of his salary guaranteed) 25 minutes tonight. They started a guy on a non-guaranteed minimum contract (Avery Bradley), a guy they claimed off waivers the day before the season started, and he played 23 minutes. Their starting center was salary dumped and bought out this summer, as was their backup point guard (Jordan and Rondo).  They combined to play 33 minutes tonight. Everyone else who played was signed for the vet minimum this summer.   This is not even close to what the Lakers rotation will look like when they are fully healthy, but right now they are missing LeBron, AD, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Ariza will probably only play about 15-20 mpg, but the other guys will probably play 25-40 mpg, and they were all out tonight. If people want to know what is going on with the Lakers, it's quite simple: it's injuries and illness."
Unironically Austin Reaves was way better as an offensive initiator tonight
Westbrook in a nutshell:  9:42		Russell Westbrook **misses** 21-foot pullup jump shot	65 - 93	  9:38		Austin Reaves offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:27		Larry Nance Jr. blocks Russell Westbrook 's 2-foot driving layup	65 - 93	  9:25		Russell Westbrook offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:24		Russell Westbrook **misses** two point shot	65 - 93	  9:24		Russell Westbrook offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:21		Russell Westbrook **lost ball** turnover (Robert Covington steals)	65 - 93

Everyone knew you were overlooking Austin Reaves
"#Lakers fan! Presti will take Westbrook for 4 1st round picks and, this is important, Austin Reaves. Deal?"
Malik Monk &amp; Austin Reaves can ride the bus. Everyone else gets to walk.
Malik Monk &amp; Austin Reaves can ride the bus back ti the hotel. Everyone else has to walk.
The Rookie Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves
Cody Zeller on court with Austin Reaves looks like a teacher-student exhibition game.
"I'm liking what Austin Reaves is giving us. Unfortunately, when Kendrick Nunn and THT come back, he may not be getting minutes anymore"
"I think these concerns are real but it’s too early for them to be serious. Nunn, THT, Ariza, and Bron have missed significant time. Austin Reaves looks legit so far. Westbrook is known to start slow and really hit high gear by All Star. Think by Christmas we’ll have a rough impression of this team. Won’t be til after All Star that we really see this team rolling."
"Big fan of Austin Reaves.    Really good back-up guard for the Lakers with a ton of potential. 20 minutes per game right now, 7.3 points, 1.3 assists, 66.7% on 4 attempts from the field."
"For the love of God, bench Westbrook for anyone. Put Austin Reaves’ dad out there."
I can definitely see how Austin Reaves' dad's name is Brian.
Where is the Austin Reaves stat line?!
Austin Reaves was great all game but he was getting torched during this run here. Lonnie is amazing
Because there was no Austin Reaves for him to abuse lmaoo
Let Austin Reaves start
Austin Reaves baby
We’re missing 5 players. Austin Reaves is closing games
Austin Reaves for Poetl straight up
havent watched much of the lakers but austin reaves must have some good dirt on vogel to get these minutes as an undrafted rookie. Seems alright but felt like he played the whole damn game
"Lakers star, Austin Reaves"
Get Austin Reaves some help
What’s the deal with Austin reaves? He gets a lot of minutes.
If you thought Caruso fandom was annoying wait until Austin Reaves fandom
Austin Reaves break out game.  maybe
Austin Reaves is going to be a midrange gawd
The lack of Austin Reaves and Alex Caruso is disturbing
Here comes Austin reaves
Austin Reaves
"Scottie Barnes, Josh Giddey and Austin Reaves deff tier 1"
Yes. Austin Reaves.
Austin Reaves AR-15 or The Trash Bros (Demar derozan and Kyle Lowry)
Don’t know why Laker fans haven’t embraced AR-15 for Austin Reaves yet.
HERE COMES AUSTIN REAVES
"The entire state is conflicted about Westbrook for sure, but I'd say maybe like 1/3-1/4 of the state feels way different about Austin Reaves. It's gotta be so cool for him that he gets to play with Westbrook now though."
Austin Reaves impressed me so far
Don't sleep on Austin Reaves. Aka Caruso 2.0  Carmelo look nice
"First time **ever** that LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Austin Reaves, and Anthony Davis have won a game together. We've all been waiting years for this moment"
And austin reaves is good
They're closing with Austin Reaves? He really is the next Caruso.
I think you forgot about Austin Reaves
"Austin Reaves is fantastic, really active defensively and making good plays offensively. That left handed pass to dwight was nasty"
Austin Reaves looks like he played with Elgin Baylor
austin reaves must be thinking he's going to wake up any second lmao... literally in the game with teammates lebron james russell westbrook dwight howard and carmelo anthony
So basically Austin reaves fixes the team right
I have no clue who Austin Reaves is but that bullet pass to Dwight was fantastic.
How long until Austin Reaves becomes the new caruso
"What, Austin reaves is getting real minutes dang"
I’m hoping Austin Reaves gets real minutes in this game
"DJ is not the main problem. It’s perimeter defense, having multiple guys injured, Russ and Melo being horrible, Austin Reaves not getting a chance, and AD shooting long 2s rather than being a beast inside."
"Nunn and THT are going to take minutes from Kent Bazemore, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, and Malik Monk.  Nothing to see here."
Extra funny because Austin Rivers thought he got traded again when they announced the Austin Reaves signing
"What if LeBron forgets to add Austin Reaves to the group chat, lol..."
"i guess one thing they can do is punt this year and trade him for smaller contracts (maybe 1 decent one and 2 bad) which will give them more flexibility for trades in the future (if they don't have to give up more than 1 FRP to move, i think they basically have 2 more they can attach to the 2 bad contracts they get back).  'cause currently, again, they have v few tradable contracts.  there's tht, and nunn would have to opt in to be traded (he probably won't do so much damage to his stock that he couldn't just sign as an FA anyway), and austin reaves is less than a minimum.  everyone else (aside from the big 3) are UFA."
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
Austin Reaves is the best player on the Lakers
Austin Reaves reminds me of some dude playing MyCareer on 2K and force trades himself onto the Lakers playing with all those HOFers on his squad.
"He's literally on the bench, Austin Reaves"
I miss javale and dwight for our front court. No clue why they went for gasol and harrel last year. Rondo is better than Westbrook for this team he plays his role better too. Start rondo bench runs or start Austin Reaves he is clutch
Austin Reaves with a +17 in a game we lost by 10 😬
Austin Reaves defense was pretty impressive ngl
Laugh all you want. The final play had Austin Reaves knocked on his ass with another no call.  Expect these refs to be called out post game.
Austin reaves can’t carry these scrubs all by himself smh
Austin Reaves everyone
Here comes Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves with the team high +/- of +17. Get this guy in the rotation and take out Bazemore or Bradley.
PLAY AUSTIN REAVES MORE
You still got Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves is literally out there playing with 4 of the top 75 players of all time lmao
Just realized Austin Reaves nickname is AR-15  Thats fire
Austin Reaves has been our 2nd best guard today he needs to get minutes
"Austin ""Alex ""Kirk Hinrich"" Caruso"" Reaves"
Austin Reaves with our best +/- lol of course
Austin Reaves definitely soaks
"alright, I want to see austin reaves play and the fan that touched rondo get a technical foul"
“Austin Reaves is the next Alex Caruso.”
Austin reaves will 🤣
"By way of being one of the only young (and currently healthy) players on the roster, I'd impartially advocate for the Lakers playing him as much as possible (while still winning) to see if more playing time can help him be a rotation-level asset to LeBron in the playoffs.  He's one of 5 guys younger than 30 on the main roster: Anthony Davis, Kendrick Nunn, Monk, Austin Reaves, and THT. Nunn was questionable coming into this game, THT is injured, and Reaves is an undrafted rookie."
I can’t wait to see Austin Reaves play in this one.  This will be a beat down
"5, including Austin Reaves"
The Lakers are so old they got confused when Austin Reaves started drinking from the same water fountain as the rest of the team.
i think that's just because you might actually recognize all their names.  other teams have more low-profile players who haven't been mentioned this off-season because they weren't FAs or traded.  but lakers have only 3 returning players from last season and every FA signing is announced and usually a name ppl would recognize.  +Austin Reaves.
"Depends  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/30/22602702/lakers-rumors-austin-reaves-joel-ayayi-turned-down-chance-get-drafted-sign-two-way-contracts  By not getting drafted in the second round, the player can  sometimes pick his team (eg that gives him best chance of success), rather than tryin to fight it out on the team that picked him  Beyond that, it's a matter of leverage for negotiation; G league player nor late 2nd round draft picks may both wind up with poor contracts. G league is worse, but it can limit the duration of your contract and allow you to hit your payday earlier/easier.  They are essentially betting on themselves as undrafted free agents. And if it doesn't work out, again as G league players"
the only one that disclosed which team was going to pick him was Austin Reaves for the Pistons and he only disclosed it because he got a contract
"If your going to take a gamble of showing the Lakers your worth a contract then you gotta show up, he wasn’t good in summer league and was invisible in preseason while Austin Reaves who took the same gamble got a two year contract"
Alex Caruso … oh wait …   Austin Reaves?
this season belongs to Jordan Poole and Austin Reaves. it is known
Why aren’t they consulting with Austin Reaves tho?
Austin Reaves prepare for it r/nba the laker fanbase is going to shove him down your throat.
"I have never been big on this THT train. Dude has some highlight plays, sure. But the times when it’s NOT a highlight play it’s just him driving into the lane with no rhyme or reason and no exit plan. He either forces a bad shot or turns it over. Combine that with lackluster defense…yeah, just not too big on him. I’m more intrigued with the potential of Austin Reaves if anything."
Who the hell is Austin Reaves? I don’t really keep in touch with West Coast teams but is he any good?

LeBron only played 29 minutes. Austin Reaves played more than him. I think the Lakers are gonna be fine.
friendship ended with ad   now austin reaves is my best friend
7 Lakers played at least 20 minutes. Their +/-s from best to worst were  * Lebron: +17 * Westbrook: +7 * Austin Reaves: +4 * Melo: -13 * Bazemore: -17 * AD: -22 * Rondo: -30  Single game plus minus isn’t very meaningful anyway but it certainly doesn’t go against Russ here
Austin Reaves can't win with these cats
is austin reaves the new ryan kelly
"Austin ""Young Kevin McHale"" Reaves"
"We need to do something about Austin Reaves name, I keep thinking it's Austin Rivers. Can we give him a nickname or something?"
"Literally the only reason he's still on the team is because he's good. If he were someone like Austin Reaves pulling this crap, he'd be out of the league"
https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2021-09-28/lakers-rookie-austin-reaves-explains-why-his-nickname-is-hillbilly
"at some point this year, more people will know about austin reaves than joe ingles"
Lol what a stupid take  Lebrons so lucky that he's 37 in his 19th year year and needs good players on his team  Did you want him to carry THT and Austin Reaves to the finals himself?   Where are all the other 37 year Olds with 19 years in the league? What part of the bench are they keeping warm?
Russ getting out played by Austin Reaves. Incredible fall from grace.
austin reaves gonna be this year's caruso
austin reaves
Austin Reaves is looking promising.
Austin Reaves is gonna be Alex Caruso with hair
I would. Seems close to Austin Reaves but he’s 22 and didn’t get boards like that
As long as Austin Reaves gets drafted I’m happy
Ya Austin Reaves gunna drop 30
"Lakers actually have 6 guys that meet the criteria of this post.   THT, Monk, Austin Reaves, Joel Ayayi, Chaundee Brown, and Mac McClung."
"I know you're joking, but as someone from there it's crazy to me how many Arkansas boys get serious PT in NBA. Portis, the Monk brothers, Pat Bev, and now Moody looks like he's gonna be solid player. And I think Isaiah Joe may develop into good role player too and Austin Reaves was making some noise in summer league so who knows how he may develop. Granted that isn't a lot, but considering how small the state is, it kinda is."
Stone Cold Austin Reaves
"I just watched the replay, and I honestly can’t fault Westbrook. He was trying to make the best of a truly broken play.  It looks like they were trying to get Melo open at the top of the arc, and have Avery Bradley leak to the space Melo emptied on the wing so Melo has the option to shoot or make the extra pass to Bradley.  But Anthony Davis set a weak screen that didn’t free Melo up, and Austin Reaves did a terrible job clearing space for Melo. Reaves is barely over half court when Melo gets to his spot, basically taking himself out of the play entirely. His man doesn’t have to worry about guarding him, so basically camps out in the spot where they’re trying to get Melo. Consequently Melo is double covered at the top of the arc.  Bradley’s guy is playing off, but spying Russ, so a pass isn’t advisable. Same with Davis. Russ can either shoot (and hope for a rebound play if he misses), or drive. Being down 3 I think he made the right decision.  It didn’t work out, but he’s trying to make the best of a bad situation.  How could they have made this play better? If Reaves cuts towards the right baseline corner he’s either going to clear space out for Melo, or potentially be open himself.  And if Davis sets a better screen for Melo, and then sets a screen for Bradley going in the opposite direction then he’s hopefully springing either Melo at the top of the arc, or Bradley cutting to the left baseline corner. Then Russ has options (or if he gets it to Melo, then Melo has the option to shoot, or make the extra pass to Bradley or Reaves). But hindsight is always 20/20."

"&gt; Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard  Lmfao"
Austin Reaves to LAL to become the second coming of 'his hairness' Alex Caruso
I’ve reached a point where’d I’d rather see austin reaves take the final shot over Russell Westbrook…what a timeline
"Tight game in the 4th and the Lakers coach Vogel takes out ALL of our offensive options AD, Carmelo, and Brodie. Rondo comes in and blows something like four layups and doesn't play defense. Monk terrified out there. Our best offensive player during that span was a fucking ROOKIE Austin Reaves. Oh man, this team is going to take years away from my lifespan."
Especially with Melo and even Austin Reaves with clutch 3s to get them there.
"We ran a lineup with Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard with like 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter."
Austin Reaves getting big crunch time minutes tells you all you need to know here
lakers fans banking on austin reaves is one of the storylines of the season for me  this is a play-in team
AUSTIN REAVES
Austin Reaves.
They forgot how to spell Austin Reaves.
Austin Reaves
"Uh, yeah? If Austin Reaves is making a difference why wouldn't the injured guys make a difference? That's 1/5 of the roster out to injury."
AR-15 (Austin Reaves)
Still missing 3 guys who were supposed to be kinda important. Luckily we scouted Austin Reaves well or else we would be in deep shit lol.
austin reaves looks like he's gonna steal your corn pone
"If you don't like Austin Reaves, you don't like basketball"
KPJ absolutely shook at a motionless Austin Reaves
"I’m just joking. Same deal with us playing DJ, Rondo, Bradley and Austin Reaves."
Can't wait until Austin Reaves and Caruso face off
Austin Reaves pushing dudes into early retirement
Laker fans believe Austin Reaves is in contention for best (sorta) second rounder. Who are the other contenders so far this season?
I don't normally follow basketball but I thought AUSTIN REAVES was a high schooler and LeBron was playing in a charity match or something
"Don't look at the stats. Look at the contents of the game. He's not just missing shots. He's playing very passive. He receives the ball and see Austin Reaves guarding him, he should attack. Instead he passes the ball out. Even the lone 30 point game, he had a hot shooting night from 3, 8-10 from 3 and then had 2 fast break dunks. He's playing the same way and that's not going to work.   Also I'm not judging him. I have watched all 6 games of his and I'm saying my observations of how he played."
Looks like austin reaves is packing that dip
Austin Reaves still looking like a Make-A-Wish kid out there
"Austin Reaves is actually legit, but it’s going to be awhile before people believe us, ala Caruso. It’s just how it goes."
Austin Reaves was undrafted and is already a solid rotation player as a rookie. Hopefully they keep it up.
This role will now be assumed by Austin Reaves. Shoutout to AR-15
STONE COLD AUSTIN REAVES
"kuzma then carusa then tht now austin reaves, go fuck yourselves lakers"
Austin Reaves is already a good NBA player.
"Austin Reaves is very solid. Defends well, passes well, hustles hard, makes open shots. I wonder why he went undrafted."
"Whys Austin Reaves playing so much, dude sucks"
Avery Bradley + Austin Reaves backcourt is the Lakers answer
Never heard of Austin Reaves before tonight but I like the way he plays.
Austin Reaves literally took over Caruso role ;0. But these game are sad....
It’s funny when you realize Austin Reaves is the best player on the Lakers
It’s funny when you realize Austin Reaves is the best player on the Lakers
Austin Reaves iso lmao
Austin Reaves looks like a default video game character before you've done anything with the sliders.
Bruh people all over this game thread comparing Austin Reaves to all sorts of different white people that he doesn’t even look like lmao
DAE Austin Reaves and Caruso because white.
Austin Reaves fills the hole in my heart that Caruso left
Austin Reaves is gonna receive hundred of thousands of all star votes and hoes will be angry
Austin Reaves is such a smart player
Austin Reaves. PG for OU last year. Single handedly kept them in the game against Gonzaga
Bro is Austin Reaves our second best player or what
"3 all stars... the veterans are way passed their prime and the 3 new players that were suppose to be in the rotation are injured. Also their youngest player is also injured. Only reason you seeing Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, and Melo is because of injuries"
"thank you. Just say it as it is. Why are people trying to come up with dummy reasons as to why we get more national recognition than others? Austin Reaves aka Hillbilly Kobe is going to be more popular than domantas sabonis in a few weeks, its not because somehow we have finals expectations and pacers dont. Caruso is the most popular player on the bulls, its not because he just drips charisma and lavine doesnt. Peoplle need to be fucking real. We get more attention because we big market and we are the fucking lakers"
"Also, the main nuance people are missing in all this piling on with the Lakers is that a huge portion of their lineup is out injured, and has been all year. Maybe that's just people willingly ignoring that fact because it's fun to pile on the Lakers, or maybe they're not even aware of it, I don't know. But the last two games the Lakers have had half their rotation out injured, which obviously puts a huge burden on the guys who are still there, which isn't ideal in a back to back on the road following an overtime game for an older team.   Someone like Melo playing 31 minutes on the second night of a b2b on the road at 37 years of age is definitely not what the Lakers were envisioning this year, but they've been forced into stuff like that (and playing Westbrook and Rondo together, or big minutes for Avery Bradley or unsigned rookie Austin Reaves, etc) simply because they're so thin on bodies right now. Missing LeBron obviously has an impact, but so does missing Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the Lakers only have one wing who's playing (Melo).   It's just a lot for a team that right now is exclusively minimum players outside of AD and Russ. And of course they're also trying to figure out playing together as they don't have any experience doing that. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Lakers are off to a rough start."
too late Austin Reaves is already ROY
They where killing us with lobs the first half. Thats like the majority of that huge lead was just the bigs abusing the vertical mismatch. OKC adjusted and started guarding the transition well and Russ didn't adjust. I actually think those Dwight ones weren't too bad and that weird austin reaves pass was excusable. To me 6 out of the 10 where on Russ truly and the rest was just the team not being where they where supposed to be at Russ's game speed.
"Austin Reaves, undrafted rookie"
Not to be rude but genuinely who tf is Austin Reaves lol
The Laker effect. Most of yall will eventually hear more about austin reaves than you do your own superstars
Austin Reaves -18 +/- #washedking

Is Austin Reaves Big Countrie’s kid?
Caruso? Austin Reaves is where it's at. Bulls got fleeced /s
Where’s summer league game winner Austin reaves???
AUSTIN REAVES VS DEVONTAE CACOK BABYYY
"I personally would like to watch Austin ""Hillbilly Kobe"" Reaves"
"How about THT, Mac Mclung, Austin Reaves chuck up 15 shots each? 🗿🗿🗿"
TEACH THE CONTROVERSY! THE ILLUMINATI DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AUSTIN REAVES IS THE REAL CULPRIT HERE!!  HE JUMPED OVER A WHOLE 14!! A WHOLE 14!!!!!!!!
"How is Austin Reaves avoiding all the flak? You put 39 before 15 like it wasn't also 15's fault for not taking 14. After Austin screwed that up, Dwight and the others were just like... okay, I see no team here. But we can make our own Big 3. We'll have such team chemistry they gonna call us McDwaundee."
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
I feel you could also blame Austin Reaves for not taking 14. Dwight should take -1.
Doesn't matter cuz at the end of the day here comes Austin Reaves.
Austin Reaves?
"This is the first time I heard of Austin Reaves, now he's one of my favorite players lol.  I hope he can hoop or this might be the last time I heard about ""Hillbilly Kobe""."
"and this ladies and gentlemen, is why austin reaves declined getting drafted by some random team and instead went undrafted to join us.    we out here right now talking about the 14th man on our squad lmaooo"
austin reaves
Yeah after the first 5 minutes we’re just gonna get Devontae Cacok vs Austin Reaves primetime matchup
"Austin ""Medium Country"" Reaves"
"Austin Reaves is a rookie and people have been talking about Austin Rivers on here for almost 10 years, if you're just skimming it's an honest mistake"
Here comes Austin Reaves
Austin Reaves probably won’t play this year but he’s a long term plan
"Dont care about that, but this is curious....  &gt;“But the Lakers still had a 14th roster spot after signing Rondo and DeAndre Jordan,” I can hear some bringing up, and while that is true, it’s also hard to argue that giving it to a rookie like Austin Reaves with some theoretical upside doesn’t make more sense with so many veterans already on the roster. There is also the reality that Reaves, a player with zero years of NBA experience, costs approximately $1.5 million less to sign than a 14-year vet like Dudley (per Larry Coon’s CBA FAQ), and that’s before factoring in the Lakers’ already-oppressive tax bill, which goes higher for every dollar they spend over the cap.  Penny pinching on that level of minimum contracts isnt a good look"
HERE COMES AUSTIN REAVES!!
Austin reaves is the future of the NBA
"Austin Reaves, over James Ennis?  ... Pelinka stay keeping our thoughts off-balance"
HERE COMES AUSTIN...Reaves?
