I like any draft that mocks Franz Wagner to us.
"Franz is a weird prospect, some have him pretty high but others don’t even have him in their top 60. I’m not sure he’s a better prospect than Garuba tbh. Garuba has a ridiculously high ceiling imo as a defender, bigger than Wagner."
"Judging by the advanced stats, I'd scream if the Spurs FO passed on Franz Wagner. Spurs need the best player available who is 6'8"" or taller."

Sengun should not be close to a lottery pick in this next draft. Magic should look at Franz Wagner or Jalen Johnson.

"Not really, he's not a bad team defender even if his main selling point is the on-ball D. If I had to give criticism, it would be that he's almost too safe in his playing style, and can't (or at least doesn't want to) disrupt an opposing offense the way a guy like Vassell or even Franz Wagner from Michigan does. But that's cherry-picking at this point"
"Hopefully Franz Wagner, Springer, Christopher, maybe Giddy or Kispert"

Bj and Davion way too high there bud    Cade Cunningham   Evan Mobley   Jalen Green  Jalen Suggs   Jonathan Kuminga   Moses Moody   Keon Johnson   Jaden Springer  Jalen Johnson    Franz Wagner
"Don’t sleep on Franz Wagner. I would take him higher than anybody you have after Jonathan Kuminga on your board. He is top 10 on my board for sure . The combination of versatility, playmaking, defense and scouring on the wing is to valuable in today’s nba. He will at least be a high level role player!"
"This is pretty wild. I like Barnes, but the top 5 is pretty set. I’d go:  1. Cade  2. Mobley  3. Suggs  4. Green  5. Kuminga   6. Keon Johnson  7. Josh Giddey  8. Scottie Barnes  9. Franz Wagner  10. Kai Jones  I do like BJ Boston though."
Franz Wagner the most German name there is.

&gt;	13) Indiana - Franz Wagner - F - Michigan  I prefer if Pacers don’t keep drafting big white guys with our first picks. They never seem to amount to anything more than bench fodder.
"So yeah, this is based on who i think will go higher, not who I think is better. I don’t think Mitchell is a lottery talent, but so many mocks I’ve seen have him as high as 6, I think he goes in the lottery, for better or for worse.  Another one is Isaiah Jackson vs Sengun.  I like Sengun better, but knowing Charlotte’s affinity for going for high profile college guys (plus the Kentucky pedigree) that I think they go Jackson.  Jalen Johnson vs Franz Wagner vs Corey Kispert also has me unsure where they are going to go.  Jalen clearly has the most upside but I really don’t know how much his “diva” antics at Duke will push him down. The opposite for Kispert - I think his defense is really sus, but his box score numbers might be super attractive to a higher lottery team to grab him"

it’s hurting Franz Wagner this year in the draft. i think he’s much better than Barnes as a prospect
"If you could do that then it gives you a chance to add some wing depth in Franz Wagner. Say you add him and try and sign a PG like Lowry in the summer then you guys are a **problem:**   Lowry, Bullock, Barrett, Randle, Robinson.   Rose, Quickley, Burks/Wagner, Toppin/Gibson, Noel."
"I think they will probably trade it.  If not, Franz Wagner, Josh Giddey, and Scottie Barnes are probably good fits in their offensive system, although Barnes may be redundant with Draymond - I'm not big on drafting for fit, but non-shooters genuinely have problems fitting together."
And getting franz Wagner in the lottery is gonna lead us to one 💯😤

Jalen Johnson is not actually good at basketball tho. I feel like Moody or Franz Wagner would be a great pick if they stay at 9.

"big fan of Moody. Also dont think Sengun is a reach at that pick, really a big fan of his defense and IQ. Usman Garuba and Franz Wagner are two that I like. Think Jalen Johnson is a good high upside pick but he's a bit of a project.  Not a fan of Kispert or Williams. I like Kai Jones for the right team, but dont think the Kings are it.  Everyone else I like at that pick range is a guard."
"Part of me thinks they need to go with a high upside forward - so any of Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson or Josh Giddey.  Kai Jones also makes sense if they think they're going to be out a big with Richaun Holmes potentially leaving. Also Kai Jones is supposed to be a half-decent 3-point shooter which would be nice against Bagley."
“Franz Wagner is a bring your lunchpail to work kinda guy”
I really hope they get Franz Wagner in the draft. He’d be an incredible fit and would bring some great defense to their team.
Franz Wagner is the answer
Why stop there? Get Franz and Moritz Wagner in there.
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."

"Kings fan here and actually thinking about writing a post.   Context  It’s important to remember that the Kings are in the Pacific Division (Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, and Kings) plus also in the Western Conference (TrailBlazers, Jazz, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Thunder, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavericks, Spurs, and Rockets), so they have to be GOOD. Like 4th through 7th seed good in the East (Atlanta, NY, Boston, Miami GOOD).  Plan  Advanced Stats wise Fox is low level all star good, but no Trae Young/Jimmy Butler/Tatum and while his shooting has improved he’s more of a 1 3PT made a game guy than 5. So we HAVE to win with Defense and Playmaking, as long as Fox is our main guy.  Maybe a hot take but I think Halliburton makes an all star team before Fox and usurps him by his 3rd year, but either way the game plan has to be let Halliburton run the offense and use Fox as a Wide Receiver with his speed while they share the court. Delon Wright/Buddy/Justin James/Terrance Davis off the bench for the 3rd guard spot.  Forward-wise older Harrison Barnes, promising Robert Woodard, and our likely SF draft pick (Franz Wagner) give us enough coverage at 3 to not get crushed by better Small Forwards. But we really fall apart at the big man spots (PF/C) with only Marvin Bagley as our only under contract player.  This is where it looks hopeless. Even Bagley believers think that his only value is returning a late 1st and getting his $11M salary off the books. In Monty’s shoes I move him via waive if we can’t get a 2nd rounder and free up his cap space. Once we have that $11M back, we can sign one off Holmes back/Daniel Thesis/Otto Porter Jr. to fill a PF or C spot, bring back Metu/Jones to give back up C minutes, and use our Midlevel to sign Bismack Biyambo or Dwight Howard.  From there it’s all about the entire 9 man rotation committing to running down the opposing teams shot clock every possession and using Fox’s athleticism to get in front of every fast break."
"Chad Ford mentioned on Ryen Russillo’s pod that he thinks Franz Wagner &amp; the Kings are a lock, the way Poku was the worst-kept secret about OKC’s interest."
"Franz Wagner seems like a solid starter, he’s who I’m hoping for."
"Would the Magic and Lakers consider a Kyle Kuzma for Terrence Ross swap? Magic are rebuilding and loading up on young pieces, while Ross would be a great fit as the third scorer for the Lakers.   **Lakers:** KCP, Ross, Bron, AD, some centre?   **Magic young talent depth chart:**  PG: Fultz, Anthony.  SG: Hampton, hopefully BJ Boston at 33.  SF: Kuzma, Franz Wagner.  PF: Kuminga, Okeke.   C: WCJ, Bamba."
"His takes are typically pretty unpopular in the moment but in my experience they age well.   For example right now he has Cade as the #4 prospect, and has Franz Wagner over Jalen Green."

"This is not a simple question because we don't know the options. I'd test the value of Brandon Ingram, but I don't know if there's a market for him or not. Same with Lonzo's SnT value.  Shedding Bledsoe is probably a high priority, but even that's hard to conceptualize. Maybe Charlotte takes him if you throw in Hayes too? I honestly don't know.  The #10 Pick though isn't too tough, I'm hoping they go for Franz Wagner. Versatile 3&amp;D wing, should be available at #10, easy pick unless someone crazy drops."

Franz Wagner gonna run this division baby
Franz Wagner in the Top 15 (I hope so)
Franz Wagner

"Carlisle traditionally has not played rookies and Duarte is about the highest floor prospect in the draft. He'll be able to slide in and contribute immediately.  When you're as ""win-now"" as the Pacers are it doesn't really bode well for player development so getting a plug-and-play like Duarte makes a lot of sense for us.   I was high on either Franz Wagner or Josh Giddey but both of those guys were off the board by then. A couple of guys in a similar vein to Duarte that were available were Corey Kispert and Moses Moody.   Apparently GSW really wanted Duarte since they're trying to make the most of the rest of their core's prime."

"This is a tricky one, as a lot of busts were not really surprising to anyone but the team that drafted them (for example, the Magic took Franz Wagner #8 this year. A guy whose ceiling is a backup big on a bad team.) Also, predicting someone will be a top-5 guy in the league is a bold statement that's most likely to be severely biased and ridiculous. With all due respect, I think you may be the only person outside of MCW's family who thought he'd be a top-5 player.   With those disclaimers out of the way, I think Jay Williams has to be up there. Who knows what he may have accomplished."
"He can definitely dribble and pass.  He got overwhelmed by Kuminga physically, but I'd bet that's the strongest player he's ever faced up to this point. Give him a chance to adjust. Same for Franz Wagner who also got physically overwhelmed by Kuminga a few times."
"You guys have a really fun team, will be one of my other teams I follow closely this season! Will the depth chart look like this?  Fultz, Suggs, Ross, Okeke, WCJ  Anthony, Hampton, MCW, Franz Wagner, Bamba   Harris, Mo Wagner, RoLo"
Can we get a side by side of Sengun and Franz Wagner? They look fucking identical
And franz wagner lmao wtf happened
Meanwhile Cole Anthony on some bs and Franz Wagner just straight trash.  I wish Kuminga fell to 8.

"Wow, this take is the worst combination of confident and dead wrong that I've seen in a long time.  You clearly have not watched a single minute of Franz Wagner actually playing basketball.  Like everyone else in the comments here who follow Michigan basketball, I'm telling you that this take is fucking *stupid.* Like, hilariously stupid.  Franz Wagner is as prototypical a SF wing as you can possibly get.  He has the frame of an adolescent deer and spent his entire NCAA career guarding opposing ballhandlers. He's not playing a minute at PF for Orlando, and I'll put money on that."
"franz is a sf, and who cares? they aren’t winning any games anyway and i’m guessing wagner is catching DNP’s for a lot of the season. isaac probably isn’t even going to play at the beginning of the season. it’s depth"
"I didn't like trading 2 first round picks for a 30 year old. One of those picks already ended up in the lottery (#8, Franz Wagner).   Also just not a fan of old school post up bigs who don't run the floor and aren't defensive assets. Like I'm not dying to give up lottery picks for the right to pay that guy $25m.   Hopefully I'm wrong, I want to see these Bulls succeed."
This kinda has me worried for Franz Wagner.
"Well apparently they were targeting Franz Wagner when they traded up, with Giddey as a backup, but Orlando and OKC ruined their plans. Still, they spent a lottery pick on Ziaire so I'm sure they believe in him."
The same thing happened to me with Franz Wagner. I saw like 6-8 Franz Wagner games and they were all games where he played bad or mediocre
"Nah he tweeted 4 days ago when the trade happened that they were wanting Giddey at no. 10. Then his very next tweet was about also wanting Wagner, although he says Franz likely wouldn’t be there at ten"
Franz Wagner will be a bust  or is that a popular opinion?
"'Entirely off of wingspan' is an exaggeration made to better suit your POV.   He has huge hands.   They are a foot long. The base of his wrist where his hand starts to his middle finger is the size of a full 12"" Subway sandwich.   Suggs is a better leaper, but Barnes is a good athlete too. He has an ABSURD wingspan. 7'3"" wingspan is insane. Length is SO important in a league where people are playing and guarding 1 thru 5 in this day and age of NBA hoops. Suggs is a score-first 6'4"" guard in a league where point guards of his generation are 6'6"", 6'9"", 6'8"" 6'10""   Look at the comparable talent in this draft class. Cade is 6'8"", Barnes is 6'9"", Kuminga is 6'9"" and could easily see point forward minutes like Draymond, Franz Wagner is 6'8"", Josh Giddey is around there as a 2, etc..."
We don’t want him. We got Franz Wagner 😎
Yeah but you could’ve went for NBA-ready picks like Franz Wagner and probably Murphy with the 14th?   Maybe I just don’t see the rationale behind Kuminga - are you all okay with that pick?
"I'm actually a ALBA Berlin season ticket holder, the club that ""made"" both Moe and Franz Wagner. I've seen both of their first pro games, even tho Moe only got e few mins, normally in blowout games, while Franz was a legit starter at 17 y/o. Let me tell you, I've never seen someone so talented at such a young age. The amount of crunch time shots and moves this dude made was crazy, he seems to have no nerves at all. And I was kinda baffled seeing him last night, cause he *really* grew up over those last 2 years. Not only regarding his build, also the kind of swag he brings with him. I think he's gonna surprise quite a few people."
Moody  Franz Wagner might be really good
"Ikr, I'm so tired of these comments. Like yeah let's pass up on potentially the highest potential in the draft to draft fucking Franz Wagner. Even if we want to go all in on this season Kuminga is better trade bait"
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."
Warriors got a good draft. End of discussion   It’s a matter of those picks work out for them but Kuminga and Moody are lovely for any team at 7 and 14 really  Alternatively you could wonder what if they got Franz Wagner and Chris Duarte instead but ehh
"Huh, Franz Wagner went at 8 (just catching up here)"
Yea I have watched a lot of franz wagner he can defend really well. He’s a streaky shooter but aside from that he is a decent playmaker for his position  I don’t think he’s a future star in the nba but I think he can be a solid starter at the 3 and be a 3 and d guy if he gets more consistent
I wasn’t watching but I overheard some absolute moron compare Franz Wagner to Jokic??????
Franz Wagner looks like a quality lover
Franz following in the footsteps of Magic legend Mo Wagner
"Franz ""Fran Vasquez"" Wagner"
FRANZ WAGNER
"I can see Golden State taking Kispert/Franz Wagner at 14, would be a good fit"
Franz Wagner goes to Magic so he can play with his brother probably. That's quite touching.
Franz Wagner
I actually think this is a good spot for franz wagner. Maybe warriors go bouknight
Only player in the Draft I know is Franz Wagner.
How does Franz Wagner get an intro but Ayo doesn't
"&gt; Excluding Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley (everyone is keeping a close eye on them)  Lol how are you gonna say this and then talk about Jalen Green like he's not in that category.  To answer your question though--for me as a Michigan fan,  it's Franz Wagner. Apparently he's grown to 6'10""/6'11"" since the season ended. Top tier defender and can do it all on offense. Outplayed Scottie Barnes start to finish in the NCAA tourney."
1. Jalen Green  2. Cade Cunningham  3. Franz Wagner  4. Evan Mobley  5. Davion Mitchell  6. Alperen Sengun  7. Jalen Suggs  8. Jared Butler  9. Sharife Cooper  10. Moses Moody
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
6’11 Franz Wagner come on down!!
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Jalen Suggs  3. Evan Mobley  4. Franz Wagner  5. Josh Giddey  6. Jalen Green  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Jaden Springer  9. Moses Moody  10. Jalen Johnson  I biased my list towards high lotto picks that will get the most playing time and chances to succeed.
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Evan Mobley 3. Jalen Suggs 4. Jalen Green 5. Scottie Barnes 6. Jonathan Kuminga 7. James Bouknight 8. Franz Wagner 9. Josh Giddey 10. Ziaire Williams
"Knowing how Daryl operates, I would be surprised if he hasn't at least discussed Tobias Harris in some capacity. But Harris' name has not really been mentioned by team sources this week. With Kuminga, if he's still there at 8 and Franz Wagner is not, there seems to be a chance Orlando could take him, yes."
"There was a belief among league executives that San Antonio was hoping to trade up for Franz Wagner, but now it seems the Spurs will stand pat at #12. Moody keeps being linked there. I fully expect DeRozan to move on in free agency."
"Having done almost no actual research since the Celtics don't have any first rounders...  Star: Cade, Mobley, and Green obviously. I like all three guys. If I want to pick maybe a non-star but a guy with a really good long career, I think Franz Wagner is going to be an excellent jack-of-all-trades player that every contender will want.  Bust: Not a full *bust*, but James Bouknight seems like more of a floor-raiser than a ceiling-raiser. Not a big fan of streaky score-first guards with mediocre passing instincts and poor defense. Those players always seem to get way less useful the second the playoffs start.  Steal: Is it weird I kind of still like Luka Garza? 95% of me knows that a slow center with poor defense just isn't cut out for the league, but he was just so dominant in college that I can talk myself into taking a chance on him in the 2nd round. He barely even needs to focus on training his basketball skills, just 100% on athleticism."
"No, I get Kuminga’s potential but he’s a huge bust risk, and even if he pans out it would take several seasons. We already have Wiseman as a project and the players will riot if we take another - and for good reason: when you have an all time great like Steph, you have to do all you can to win now.  So if we keep the picks, I want Wagner, who can guard multiple positions at a high level, and already has the passing and IQ to do well in our offense as a tertiary playmaker and slasher. His shooting is promising too. And he’s only 19! I’m a big believer in him. Especially since he’s supposedly 6’11 now.   Moody is more of a project but even still he brings immediate perimeter defense and shooting, with potential to become a truly great 3&amp;D player. He could help us immediately off the bench too   Ideally, I see Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney, Poole/Moody/Juan/Franz/Wiseman as our ten men. Maybe Nico is coming in hot too, after his amazing olympics. I haven’t completely written off Paschall yet either. Lee we’ll keep as an end of bench guy since he’s Stephs brother in law and has the size and experience to be an emergency wing. Hope we pick Chriss back up too to round it out as our third big man."
Franz Wagner is on the list for 7th. Idk why OP posted Tim Kawakami's tweet is just more so him speaking his mind rather than actual news
Franz Wagner will be a multiple time All-Star  Corey Kispert will be picked by the Kings at 9
"You guys honestly could even be in a position to trade back.  From pick 6 on a lot of teams want specific players but that’s where things kind of explode.  Moses Moody, Franz Wagner, Jonathan Kuminga, Bouknight.  I could see you guys getting a lot of value for that 6th pick.  You figure that 6th pick is what, a 3rd or 4th pick most years?"
Franz wagner just grew an inch and a half apparently
"It's probably more picks and someone like Bazley going the other way. I still think that the pressure is on Cleveland to win relatively soon and they could do with a guy like Jerome or Kenny Hustle off the bench. Nothing spectacular but just solid, productive role players. If Barnes is not there at 6 which is unlikely, moving up to get Mobley is the right move. For the Cavs, getting off Love and removing the obligation to pay Sexton provides greater flexibility. Garland, Allen and Okoro are all interesting young players. Adding a strong pick at 6 say Moses Moody or Franz Wagner or even Josh Giddey would fit nicely into their core"
"&gt; You are being a huge homer if you think the Hawks wouldn't accept the number 7 pick for him instantly.   No I'm really not, I think you don't understand the struggles 95% of rookies coming into the NBA are negative value players. He's literally *younger* that guys mocked there like Davion Mitchell and the same age as Franz Wagner while offering more upside.  It's not that I'm overrating Cam, you are overrating the impact that rookies have in the short term. The Hawks are trying to be a playoff team. I'd rather trade Cam for a proven NBA player than pick 7."
"I wish Franz was playing for Germany, I get why he isn’t with the draft tomorrow but it would’ve been fun to see the Wagner brothers play together"
"That still happens now.  Just scouring nbadraft.net , the first white guys i come across:  Franz Wagner - Nemanja Bjelica  Josh Giddey - Joe Ingles"
"Franz Wagner, projected to be a lottery pick in the upcoming draft  An interesting prospect with a decent jump shot, and surprising playmaking ability"
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6.

I want Franz Wagner and Jared Butler. It might not be worth drafting them with picks 7 and 14  but I love their games.
Warriors-  I’d like them to draft Franz Wagner.  I think they will draft James Bouknight.
Is Franz Wagner not competing because of the draft or was he not invited?
Franz Wagner
Franz Wagner gonna be good
"Idk much about their needs but maybe Moses Moody, Franz Wagner or Kai Jones would be a good fit and they’re all slotted around that area in the draft. Maybe Josh Giddey? Guess we’ll see"
"this is such a dub for Memphis.   Damn good chance that you could get Bouknight at 10 who would be super dynamic with Ja  you also have Franz Wagner would can guard 2-4 and would team up with Clarke and JJJ to make an insane defensive front court who can switch everything and protect the rim  they could even draft 18 year old Sengun who could be better than JV and Adam’s combined in 2 years    not even mentioning Adam’s will be able to give you enough minutes that JJJ’s fouling tendencies can be remedied a bit, plus he’s a fantastic locker room guy  if Bledsoe is in playoff contention, maybe you get some fat Raymond Felton production or something   Lakers could easily end up being another good young player that you’d get for 4 years when you are paying JJJ/a"
"There’s two amazing players (according to advanced analytics, which Memphis favors) in that pick range, Alperen Sengun and Franz Wagner, both of whom would fit amazing on the grizzlies roster."
"Am I the only one that thinks this is a steal for Memphis?   This allows them to play JJJ at his natural position. Gives them the ability to draft a great wing like Franz Wagner or Jalen Johnson and Adams is only a marginal downgrade from Valanciunas.   Lakers first rounder is likely to be a late first, but Memphis has shown a great eye for finding talent too."
I was certain they were going Franz Wagner
"Right on, I’m personally a bigger believer in Moses Moody, Franz Wagner, and Keon Johnson than Bouknight even if it’s not Barnes or Kuminga at 6"
"I mean yeah Cade is good and all, but a draft that has Franz Wagner? Sorry bud, you’re getting outclassed here"

Dwight –&gt; Vuc –&gt; Wendell Carter and Franz Wagner? Not a big win if you ask me
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
Franz Wagner is going to be special
"more time to develop. davion Mitchell and franz Wagner would not have been 1st round picks in the 2020 nba draft, and thus wouldn’t get any guaranteed money"
Franz Wagner
"MCW is not the backup SF, he's like the 15th man. He probably doesn't play outside of garbage time.  It'll be probably be:   * Cole Anthony  * RJ Hampton  * Terrence Ross  * Franz Wagner  * Mo Bamba  Most of these bench units are missing key guys, possibly because you used ESPN. [This is a much more accurate source (although not perfect)](https://www.nbcsportsedge.com/basketball/nba/depth-charts).  In no order: Boston, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Washington probably are the top 5."
[Franz Wagner](https://youtu.be/Q4Rh06t6wVE) (Hilarity start at around 21:50)
"Zach missed the last few weeks of the season, Vooch barely played like 20 games. DeRozen gives us high level playmaking, free throws, and closes out games. All areas where we struggled last season  And yes I’m sure all Bulls fans are crying over not drafting Franz Wagner😂😂"
"John Wall when healthy was a top 3 PG  Fans and sometimes teams overrate the hell out of assets.   Example if you’re a middling or average team that can trade for an allstar or allstar level player that will more than likely make you way better you should do it. That random 1st round pick you’re holding so dearly onto will likely never be as good as the player you’re trading for, and if you’re trading for a GOOD player you shouldn’t have to worry about the pick being incredibly high. For example the bulls basically trade Wendell Carter, Otto Porter Jr, a first round pick that will likely never be an allstar,  and Franz Wagner who will likely never be an allstar for Vucevic and they should and would do it again.   Another example could be that Heat pick from a few years ago. Teams thought they hit a gold mine with that one Heat pick and what did that turn into? 18th pick Tre Mann right?"
That's kinda how Franz Wagner was I feel like. Like nobody saw him and was like wow this is a future superstar.   But the only issue with ur statement is that nobody is gonna purposefully draft a guy who's gonna average 10 his entire career in the lottery and that's where the bad comps are.
"FW?  Fetty Wap, Forest Whitaker... Franz Wagner?"
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
"In what world is Franz Wagner a better long-term asset than SGA, Ja, or JJJ"
Jonathan Isaac  Mo Bamba Wendell Carter Jr Markelle Fultz  Cole Anthony  RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke
Dude.  Seriously stop.  Counting stats.  Al Horford is one of the best centers of the last 15 years.  Elite role players are PJ Tucker or Patrick Beverly.  People like Bruce Bowen or Derek Fisher.  Elite role players are luxuries but can still be replaced by other players who may not be able to do what they can do.  Al Horford is an All Star and a legit one.  He’s one of the most versatile defensive bigs in recent history.  He can be the hub of a conference finals team offense like with the 2018 Celtics.  Just being the best player on multiple conference finals team by definition makes him more than an elite role player.  Is Vuc an elite role player because as good as Vuc is now he was never as good as Al Horford in his prime.  Prime Al Horford was a top 25 to 30 player in the league.  Is your idea of an elite role player anybody who isn’t a top 20 player?  You realize how silly what your saying is right.  Franz Wagner will be lucky to ever be half as good as Al Horford.
"Ya it’ll be the Magic. Our defense will be what makes our dynasty and once we pry a disgruntled star from some team next year for the #1 pick we’re getting for this year, our rebuild will be accelerated. I’m thinking Markelle, Suggs, Zion, JI and WCJ as the starters and Cole Anthony, Ross, Chuma, Franz Wagner and Mo as the bench. Sprinkle in some vets and with a defensive focus and JI healthy, I’m thinking we make a run for Bill Russell’s 11 championships."
Franz Wagner propaganda train going full steam
I like that Wagner kid too. Franz I think . Dude can play
Please tell me how someone who isn't quick with his feet or good vertically is a good athlete.  Having quick hands and good balance doesn't make you a high level athlete.  He's easily below average but makes up for it with his athletic ability.  Looking athletic in college doesn't translate to the NBA.  He's athletically outmatched on most matches.  Wagner can at least load up for a dunk once in a blue moon.  Franz tried it and missed in the summer league I want to say.  Different levels.
I'm surprised how little people are talking about Franz. I keep thinking he's the Wagner that's been playing in the NBA for 3 seasons
"OG, Tatum, Bridges, SGA, Ant, Schroeder, Franz Wagner in a fourteen team league.  I am a fantasy GOD!"
Franz Wagner has been looking quite solid imo
He's definitely athletic...do you think Mo Wagner is the guy you drafted? Cause Franz Wagner is definitely athletic.
Can someone explain franz Wagner to me?  I have not seen any magic games so what kind of player is he?  I don't understand the pre-draft hype to now.  The others listed I get but him I don't see it.  Someone break it down
Franz Wagner literally cannot miss
Franz Wagner is about to make me act up
God damn Franz Wagner is so hot.
Franz  shocked me.  I thought he would such be he's been the most consistent player.   MO Wagner is just hot garbage.  I wish Chuna was back already
"Why is Poku considered a high ceiling player and Franz Wagner is considered a low ceiling player? They have similar size, age and playstyle but Franz is already really good at basketball and Poku is more potential.  I don't mean that in a negative way about Poku, just seems weird that people talk about their ceilings so differently when they seem like similar players to me."
"Early observation: It’s gonna be a long season. Won’t be pretty record wise, but it’s a step in the right direction. Three point shooting continues to be an issue, as does our defense.  Player that surprised me for the better: Franz Wagner  Player that surprised me for the worst: Jalen Suggs  Rookies: Kind of a mixed bag. Franz is looking good, but Jalen has been struggling  New coach: It’s a bit too early for me to give a detailed review, but I like how he has us playing at a faster pace. Like I said before, the defense isn’t great, but it’ll come with time."
"The only healthy wing defenders we have right now are Gary Harris and Franz Wagner. This was Gary Harris' first game of the season because he's been injured so I think we didn't wanna ride him too hard, and Franz was coming off playing nearly 40 minutes in the first half of the B2B so same deal.  Ideally Chuma Okeke or Jonathan Isaac would be on Jimmy but both are out atm."

"To the people who think Franz Wagner doesn't deserve to be on this list, he's been absolutely great defensively. Not a lot of defensive stats, but the Magic defense has cratered whenever he checks out of games."
I didn't think I'd be as excited about Franz Wagner as I currently am. Dude is sneaky good. Can't wait to see him alongside Markelle.
That's Franz Wagner
Franz Wagner is really good.
Franz Wagner is looking nice out there
FRANZ WAGNER EXPOSED JULIUS RANDLE
Franz fucking Wagner
Franz Wagner is peaking in too
Technically Franz Wagner is also close since he actually hasn’t attempted a FT yet so his % is undefined with a 57/57/- splits
"Feels like 40 games of Isaac, as long as he's still a plus defensive player (top 25 even, not his pre-injury top 10) would be enough for them to get above 15 and closer to 20.   The guards will mostly be horrid, but Bamba/Carter-Isaac-Franz Wagner is a structurally coherent enough frontcourt (okay defenders, nobody with horrible complimentary skills) that if one of Anthony or Suggs are good every 2-3 games, they can win some of those.   You have to be really bad to win 15. Right now, by WS/48, 4 of the 6 worst players in the league playing rotation minutes (over 15) are Magic guys (Anthony, Brazdeikis, Suggs, Mo Wagner) and that seems unlikely to last. If Suggs and Anthony can be terrible instead of dead last among starting guards as the year goes on they'll win some games.   I did seriously think about the under of 22, but I don't hate  the frontcourt enough to have them at 15, even if Anthony is going to heroically try to get them Jalen Hardy or Banchero to be their #1 scorer next year."
Add Chuma Okeke and Franz Wagner to the mix

"Mo Bamba might lead the league in blocks this yr, Jonathan Isaac is a DPOY player when healthy, WCJ is a really good defender, Franz Wagner at 6'10 and Chuma Okeke at 6'8 are long and tall wing defenders. Jalen Suggs is also a really good defender Magic have all the makings of being an elite defensive team."
Franz Wagner has put together two good games for the Magic and I still haven't seen his name mentioned on this sub once and people are posting about Suggs
"He had some issues, to be expected. The Spurs have some great defensive guard play, and they were hounding him. He missed some makable shots too. Not too worried. Honestly I’m happy that Franz Wagner looked better than expected."
" Jameer Nelson, Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkolu, Ryan Anderson, and Dwight Howard  vs  Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner, and Wendell Carter Jr  Not to mention, it’s SVG vs Jamahl Mosley, who is making his debut as a head coach.   The 2022 team is absolutely fucked"
&gt; Suggs is basically their only solid prospect at the moment.  No reason to count out Franz Wagner before he’s even played
"WCJ has shown he is a starting level center and is still only 22 with expanding range, Chuma Okeke averaged 8 ppg 4 rpg 2.2 apg 1.1 spg 0.5 bpg and shot 35% from three in his rookie season last yr and Franz Wagner will be a really good glue guy. Cole Anthony is a 6th man type of player and RJ Hampton has all the physical tools to be a really good player. JI has shown when healthy he is a top 5 defender in the NBA and is still only 24.   I agree we don't have that true superstar yet but we have really good depth and if we get a top 5 pick like Banchero, Chet, Adrian Griffin JR or Hardy that is a really good core. We can even trade some of these young guys and package them with the 1st rd picks and 2nd rd picks we have gotten from the Vuc and AG trades for a superstar or star down the line."
"Fuckin' hell, I skipped Giddey to pick Franz Wagner in my fantasy draft. Smh."
I was clearly talking ab Franz Wagner
"I didn't know there was a Franz Wagner in the league, or his brother, so that the Magic have younger and older Wagner at the same time. If they draft Karl Nietzsche that'll make his head spin."
Magic really took franz Wagner at 8 😂
Franz Wagner hasn't been it either.
"Lol bs. I follow Michigan basketball and one of the things we pay attention to each year when we’re bored waiting for the season is their growth, especially in their early years. Yeah some guys stall out, but there’s still plenty of growth. I just watched Franz Wagner go from 6’5” as a recruit to 6’7” when he walked on campus as one of the youngest players in NCAA to 6’9”+ as an NBA player. The one thing that Bates has against him is his wingspan apparently isn’t much different than his height. That’s unlikely to change if he does grow. But even if he doesn’t grow, he can put on good weight/muscle and improve his physical tests. Hell, guys train specifically to improve their physics tests in the months leading up to the combine when their college season is over. Bates has 2 years."
Franz Wagner will never play an NBA minute after this season.
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.

Franz Wagner is going to be a star
"Cade’s gonna be a nightly triple double threat (he already is). Once his shot is consistent it’s pretty easy to see multiple all stars &amp; all-NBA’s for the vegan man, just a well rounded player that’s good at everything even defence.   Mobley’s length, skill, defensive IQ, passing ability/court vision &amp; soft touch is every team’s wet dream in a big man. He’s also almost a lock for all stars &amp; all-NBAs, and will definitely contend for DPOYs.   Scottie Barnes has a ton of upside due to his monstrous frame - not to mention his skill. He’s a little too unselfish to a fault for me to consider him a future bonafide superstar, but his upside is certainly there, as a do-it-all forward that connects the offence and the defence by himself. He could play the Draymond role quite easily.    Jalen Green might not have as much upside cause of how one-dimensional he is - a pure scorer - but man can you see stardom when his shit works out right.   Then shoutout to Kuminga who got crazy potential - I see a world in which my man becomes a Jaylen Brown type, a true 2-way star - and also big shoutout to Franz Wagner, a less athletic Scottie Barnes but better on both ends.   Not to mention Sengun, such a talented big man workin down in that low block or operating in the short roll, his potential is sky high. It might be limited due to his height (only 6’9) but his passing skill is crazy, handling is nice, and IQ well beyond his years. Gotta work on his fouling tho, which will differentiate him from a starter to a backup."
Franz Wagner and WCJ isn't exactly a bad haul so far
"I have been watching a few games lately. Here's what I want to see, because I'd like to win a few.  PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Markelle Fultz  SF: Franz Wagner  PF: Jonathan Isaac  C: Wendell Carter, Jr. _____ 2nd unit: Suggs, Hampton, T. Ross, Okeke, Bamba"
Franz Wagner has been a real pleasant surprise to me. I think he can be a starter for a long time. Probably never a superstar but he's a solid starter imo. Maybe Tobias Harris level of a guy.
Cole Anthony and Franz Wagner!
Also people write off 19 year olds who don't immediately perform well in Summer League. Both Evan Mobley and Franz Wagner were getting a lot of criticism from what I recall.
"Raptors are truly one of the worst franchises in the NBA, but one year of a mercenary has turned their fans into the most annoying team in history   congratulations, outside your 1 mercenary title, you’ve sustained a level of success the last 10 years only matched by… the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers   your two greatest players in franchise history cannot manage to shoot 42% from the floor in the playoffs, your draft record is atrocious, Franz Wagner is going to make Barnes look even more questionable than it was on draft night   also nick nurse looks like your friends dad who always tried to act cool, but the second you guys want to have any fun, he shuts it down"

Franz Wagner getting some valuable exposure
Franz Wagner ROY
"1.) The Bucks being so low in the east is all the case you need to not pay attention to standings this early. Folks are getting way too high on a few teams just because they got out to a blazing hot start. Some will cool off, others will heat up and a few will stay mostly the same all year.  2.) Franz Wagner is the best player the Magic drafted and will be a franchise type player for them in the next few years. Suggs will top out as a guy that gets continuously “snubbed” of an All-Star selection.  3.) Ja Morant’s jump in PPG and 3 point shooting will win him MIP if he sustains his current level of play."
Franz Wagner is who everybody thought Mario Hezonja would be
Franz Wagner is that dude
#FRANZ WAGNER
Holy Moly! Was that Franz Wagner or Tom Chambers?
"The right now doesn't matter, they can find SFs who can replicate what Franz can give them for cheap. Porter this year and I already have them signing Thad Young next year. Plus Kuminga already looks like a monster on the defensive end, I don't know what Wagner is doing down in Orlando but he must pretty good to say he's even better than Kuminga on that end."
Didn’t even mention Franz Wagner. Casual
Franz Wagner
"I like Wagner a lot (Franz). Think he can be a good player to contribute to the winning team, especially if he focuses on his defense, as the offense is there. Especially the off ball movement sticks out."
"Cole Anthony handles most of the offensive workload but Mamba, WCJ, and Franz Wagner have all played well. The team is so young that it’s one of those things where the best player can extremely vary depending on the night."
"They're talking about ""bigger guys"" here a.k.a. guys taller than Trae, not ""big men"" in the usualy sense of the word. Franz Wagner is a small forward, not a center."
Franz Wagner is really good
why are you disrespecting franz wagner like that bru
"The reports directly after the draft were basically that the Grizzlies had made the trade with the intent of grabbing one of Josh Giddey or Franz Wagner. A lot of mocks had one or both falling to/past them so I guess it wasn't totally misguided, just didn't work out and Ziaire was their backup backup.  For Franz specifically, our POBO mentioned that they got several offers for Franz right after he was drafted, which he noted was uncommon. I'm guessing Sacramento and Memphis were at the top of that list."
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
"I’m sure they’re thanking you right back for Franz Wagner, WCJ and that other first!"
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23.

Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
And to think they could have Franz Wagner instead of Kuminga.
"Naw.  First of all, Lamelo isn't that good yet. People see the highlights and the potential, but he's not all that ... yet.   Secondly, Wiseman showed a lot of promise last year. He clearly belongs on an NBA floor physically. He's no Darko. But he really struggles with making the right reads in the system and he has to learn how to play defense against guys who are big, strong, and athletic.   Neither of those things should be remotely concerning at this point. He's a guy who had no college season, no summer league, and essentially no training camp.   When you draft a 19-year-old, you need to have patience. This is especially the case because he was raw by the standards of 19-year-old rookies - see the previous paragraph.   Context matters and the tendency on r/NBA is to ignore it. The Warriors would probably be better *right now* if they had drafted Lamelo and and Franz Wagner instead of Wiseman and Kuminga, but it's entirely possible that they'll be better in three years with the guys they took.   I suspect that by the end of the season we'll be seeing both Poole and Kuminga running pick-and-rolls with Wiseman in the second unit, and he'll be picking up lots of easy dunks."
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Jalen Green  4. Josh Giddey  5. Franz Wagner  6. Chris Duarte  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Davion Mitchell  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Alperen Sengun  11. Cam Thomas  12. Jeremiah Robinson Earl  13. Jared Butler  14. Sharife Cooper
He meant Franz Wagner
"bro you're in argument mode trying to cherry pick a scenario where yes, it didn't tell us too much. But there are also scenarios where we find out things like, ok yes Scottie Barnes can get points against NBA defenses right now, or ok Franz Wagner looks like his scoring game is more polished than advertised and works in the league"
TIL I always thought Franz Wagner was an auto generated rookie in 2k lol
Evan Mobley 52%   Scottie Barnes 52%  Franz Wagner 47%   Alperen Sengun 47%  Chris Durate 45%
"I mean I'm not writing Suggs off, but what you've pointed out hasn't exactly stopped Franz Wagner from being great."
"I was terribly wrong about Evan Mobley, and I was also terribly wrong about Lamelo and Franz Wagner.   I should stop being so sure that certain players won't pan out."
Now post Franz Wagner OP
"Vooch turned into WCJ, Franz Wagner, and subsequently helped us tank for Suggs....I like Vooch as mush as the next fan but if youd rather have 2 guys that are on the wrong side of their prime than a 22 year old, a 21 year old, and a 20 year old then I want what you're smoking.  The Bulls deal is one of the best deals the Magic have made in quite sometime....Oh yea, we also own Chicago's 23' 1st rounder"
Suggs has been…..  Franz Wagner has been great tho!
Franz Wagner no bias
Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
Have been watching a lot of Magic games this season - Mo Bamba is looking real nice and so does Franz Wagner. It will be only a matter of time before Jalen Suggs gets it together and the Magic will look really dangerous. I admire Mosley prioritizing letting the young players have as much playing time as possible over the vets.
# FRANZ WAGNER
Franz Wagner is top 3
i think franz wagner also deserves a shout
Franz Wagner?
Franz Wagner ended the Timberwolves franchise so it’s to be expected
Barnes also isn’t too aggressive on scoring yet he’s leading all rookies. He’s just fundamentally sound for someone who’s in their first year. Duarte’s a bucket getter and Mobley is a freak. Not to mention Giddey putting in work.  Another name that doesn’t come up to much is Franz Wagner who’s also looked pretty good.  Cade and Green would have to really dial it up to get to 1 and 2 imo
franz wagner fmvp? sign me up
"God I can’t stand Franz Wagner. He’s such a stupid arrogant asshole. I just get so frustrated every time I see his stupid boyish smile, and dumb sexy soul patch, and idiotic beautiful eyes.  Seeing him run around on the court and make these ridiculous shots and steal the ball from the Celtics and hit these wide open 3s, I just get so angry that it makes blood rush to my penis and it gets little bit hard from sheer rage. I just wish I was out on the court so I could run up to him and foul the shit out of him as hard as I can, and rip his jersey off and look directly into his stupid, beautiful face as I rub my crotch on his tall skinny white body. I’d get as close to his face as I could and whisper in his ear softly “Ja, I got you, you fucker. You’re not as good as you think you are. Nein, nein, nein.”  Then for good measure I would put my lips on his face so that I could taste his fear and I would smell his hair so that I knew what it was like to dominate Franz Wagner. Oh how I want that. I think about it at night sometimes when I am in bed with my girlfriend. I just want to know what it’s like to be on top of Franz Wagner like that.  Stupid, beautiful Franz Wagner, I just hate him so much."
welcome to the franz Wagner show
Franz Wagner has never had a single digit scoring game
"Tbh I think mobley should be first, josh giddey third, and Franz Wagner fourth"

Franz Wagner is only 20. You're thinking of Moritz Wagner
"Yo, what’s that sound? Ok yeah, me being absolutely fuckin right about Franz Wagner!  My heart dropped when the Magic took him one spot ahead of us man… I love Davion though, he’s honestly changing this team as a rookie which is crazy"
You might be thinking of Mo Wagner. Franz is 20
As a German I cringe at the name Franz Wagner....damn how cliché German can a name be?

"Here are his previous comments on the raptors in the last week (We won the last 4 games in a row btw)  ""Mobley you can make a case for but all Barnes has done is empty stats""  ""lmao OG does not belong here"" (On a post referencing og winning MIP)  ""Best player from this draft class, cant believe r/nba said Scottie Barnes and Giddey better lol""  ""Franz Wagner &gt; Barnes tbh.""  (Made a post about Scottie being off the bench despite being our best player)  ""Overpaying Fred and Trent. These bums earning 40 million a year combined is gonna kill our cap""  ""Oh my god get this bum FVV off the team. Garbage player""  &amp;#x200B;  You really think this guy is a real raptors fan?"
Only one Franz Wagner
Should have drafted Franz Wagner #1
Not Franz Wagner
"I'm not a draft scout 😂  I just meant the name, that mo Wagner might drag Franz down because of how he panned out. And I'm still high on Moritz."
"Should have traded him for Franz Wagner ""WHEN"" you still had the chance...too late now"
Wagner makes my franz wag
"Cole Anthony being a MIP candidate and nailing the Franz Wagner pick has accelerated our rebuild. There's a lot of hope in the air right now surrounding this team, we've had some close losses and some losses on back-to-backs.  Safe to say I'm feeling great about the future of this team. But even more so if 1. Fultz comes back and somehow can shoot again and 2. If Suggs finds his stroke.  I see a lot of growth from our players under Coach Mosely, he's the perfect coach for this young team. Very happy we blew the team up last year, it was completely necessary."
Franz Wagner is ROTY and MVP
"Franz wagner is playing like year 4 mikal bridges at Age 20 in year 1, crazy. Hes reminds me of lesser physical profile scottie barnes but still athletic 2 way wing with high ball iq with a progressive shot. Both of them are going to be stars"
Franz Wagner is gonna be good as fuck. Good for Orlando
"Franz Wagner is shooting lights out right now, but he's also got a silky smooth sweeping floater and little hook that I had no clue he had in his bag. There's so much more polish to his offensive game than pundits and fans were giving him credit for. Even his handle is better than I think most of us expected.  His defense has been as good as advertised, but holy hell he plays like such a veteran on offense. His shot profile is pristine, he's making the right decisions, and he's only 8 games into his professional career. If his off-the-dribble pull up game improves (which honestly it might already be good but he just hasn't taken a lot of those shots yet), Franz has the chance to be really special."
Franz Wagner is gonna be a star

&gt; I see a lot of Michigan fans say this but I feel like there is a bit of recency bias from the tournament.  I mean you can take a look at his [game log](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/franz-wagner-1/gamelog/2021/) from this past season. He was definitely inconsistent and never shot this well
13 NBA General Managers selected Luka over everyone in the NBA. (12 took Giannis.)  So obviously the answer is:  .  .  .  .  Wagner.  Franz Wagner
"Vanderbilt: ""I just got posterized by Franz fucking Wagner and the ball smacked me in the face after he dunked it..."" Prince Zuko: ""That's rough buddy"""
FRANZ WAGNER &gt;  MICHAEL JEFFREY JORDAN
Why is the whole video about Franz Wagner
"While Moe Wagner might not be as skilled, he trained with Franz a ton during COVID-19. I was so lucky to see them both play at Michigan but I can’t state it enough, Franz has an infinite upside to him. I do feel that his immediate impact has a lot to do with the training he did with Moe and then playing for Juwan. I’m so excited for his future 🤘"
Franz Wagner is my dad
"I’m so sorry that Cole Anthony and Franz Wagner hate Minnesota, Wolves fans.   Wolves had lots of guys injured, but we got some injuries too  — A W is a W.  GG."
"I think I'm commited to getting a Scottie Barnes City Jersey, but man Franz Wagner is tempting me  As a Michigan fan I'm getting a Franz jersey eventually and hopefully Caleb Houstan gets drafted to a team with good jerseys"
The east runs through Franz Wagner
Is it too early to buy a Franz Wagner jersey?

"Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and savior Franz Wagner?"
We’re not gonna get a lot of wins this year let me just say this    FRANZ WAGNER &gt; LEBRON JAMES
Franz Wagner has been very impressive.
"In the future they will say ""Where were you when Franz Wagner got the ultra green light?"""
FRANZ MF WAGNER  Mods pls change my flair to him. He’s officially overtaken Ty Lue for GOAT.
Franz. Wagner.
I want it to be known that I was the first Franz Wagner Orlando Magic fanpage on twitter
Franz Wagner
Franz Wagner
Franz Wagner
is franz Wagner LARRY BIRD?
Franz Wagner smash! Wow!
franz Wagner OMG
can we talk about franz Wagner
What is this bullshit list from yahoo sports? Franz wagner is above Suggs at the moment. And Cade is in this list why?
This list has Cade Cunningham above Franz Wagner lol
"Yeah, this is basically like crack for my Orlando Magic brain...   The eye test has definitely been telling me the starters have played ""well"" and as soon as we break up that 5 man unit it all goes to hell and a handbasket, particularly when we go to units without one of Anthony or Suggs.  Seeing it reinforced by the actual lineup data is very reassuring though. I think with how well WCJ/Bamba have done on the court together we'll likely see that duo continue playing together once we're fully healthy as well. The fact that the defense has been stifling with that fivesome and the offense has been actually above average is a very very good start. Those are five guys who will be playing with each other for years to come potentitally.  TBH, we're getting closer and closer to the point where I'd say the Magic should send Hampton to the G league to work on his game. We're obviously not competing this year, it's about developing guys, but we want to be developing the right guys and the right habits. Hampton has looked very out of sorts and overmatched in basically ever lineup he's been in so far. Once Fultz is back and healthy I think Hampton should go to Lakeland and just work on his game there. Maybe he gets better, maybe not. He's not getting any better by getting torched by NBA players every night though.  IF Isaac/Okeke/Fultz/MCW can come back healthy and STAY HEALTHY, we should be able to shore up the more rickety parts of the bench, especially the defense and the ball movement when Suggs/Anthony are sitting.    Ideally we'd do this rotation/minute distribution when fully healthy:  PG - Fultz (28 minutes) Anthony (20 minutes)  SG - Suggs (28 minutes) Ross (12 minutes) Anthony (8 minutes)   SF - Wagner (24 minutes) Okeke (12 minutes) Ross (12 minutes)  PF - Isaac (28 minutes) Okeke (10 minutes) WCJ (10 minutes)  C - Bamba (28 minutes) WCJ (20 minutes)  With minutes/roles fluctuating based on matchups. Honestly its crazy to me that Franz has led the team in minutes played, but it's even crazier that he's been one of the most effective guys based on the data... Hard to limit him to only 24 minutes here, but the other option is really cutting Ross or Okeke's minutes...  Unlikely we'll need to be too worried about the minutes as it's hard to imagine we'll have the whole squad 100% healthy for long stretches."
Franz Wagner
"I would say that out of all the big star rookies, Franz Wagner has just as good a chance as anyone."
Miles and Mikael Bridges…  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels…  Franz and Moritz Wagner….  Shit’s getting confusing.
"It's horrible defense. Cole Anthony missing a free cut by Franz because Cade lost track of his man: https://i.imgur.com/bMWd30i.jpeg  Then bit hard on a spin move, but Franz didn't take the uncontested 10 foot jump shot: https://i.imgur.com/P8t84Pj.jpeg  Franz Wagner proceeds to play black hole hero ball while losing the ball."

"Are they on the phone with the Rookie Of The Year, FRANZ WAGNER?!"
It's only his 6 game but damn it has me nervous. He had a really good game yesterday though and took over and willed us back.   But I'm glad we also had the 8th pick and at least early it appears we hit on Franz Wagner.
"Yeah Cole Anthony's a good watch to be fair, and I like their Franz Wagner."
"Right now the magic have,  Franz Wagner   Moe Wagner  Mo Bamba  Wendell Carter Jr   Michael Carter Williams"
"Franz Wagner has also been playing really well. Tonight wasn't his best game, but he's exceeded a lot of expectations so far. The Magic starters have been playing really well and the oldest guy is Bamba who is only 23. We have a lot to be excited about."
Markelle Fultz   Cole Anthony   RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke  Jonathan Isaac  Wendell Carter Jr   Mo Bamba  is a solid core plus a top 5 pick hopefully added
I really doubt Chuma will start unless the coaches like him over Franz Wagner. I don’t think they’ll go away from the two big starting lineup unless they decide to start limiting Wendell Carter’s minutes as the season progresses.
Franz Wagner tonight: 10/4/2 with a steal.  Dalano Banton tonight: 10/5/2 with a couple steals.
Took a Franz Wagner thumb to the eye before halftime and left the floor with like 30 seconds remaining.
"People like KOC and The Athletic guys weren't really pushing Giddey for 7th lol If anything, they were pushing Davion Mitchell or Franz Wagner for 7th due to their ability to contribute now. Moody &amp; Bouknight also received some support pre-draft too"
In December Franz Wagner is going to be in MVP talks
"It was before my time, I only got to see the Dwight days. I have hope though, I’m high on Franz Wagner rn. Hes been quietly been looking like a top 5 rookie."
"Yeah but consider that the Magic drafted the future goat, Franz Wagner"
"No Suggs won’t win it, Franz Wagner will"
Franz Wagner will be the face of the magic by end of the season.
