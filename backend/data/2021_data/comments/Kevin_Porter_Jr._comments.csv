kevin porter jr got traded for 4 seconds from us to the cavs
"Kevin Porter Jr. is extremely talented, but he has major behavioral problems.  The fact that the Riders wanted to get rid of him at all costs is not reassuring to me.  The Rockets are making a bet with him. If it doesn't work out, Kevin Porter Jr.'s NBA career could already be over."

"The first step unfortunately, because I think it is admitting failure on a valiant cause of trying to save the kid, is to trade Kevin Porter Jr. I thought the situation was being handled remarkably well by Coach Bickerstaff et al until he set the whole thing back with his tantrum  SexLand‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, Okoro, Allen, Delly, and Nance are non-negotiable for me.

"[According to basketballnews.com](https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-rumors-cleveland-cavaliers-expected-to-move-kevin-porter-jr-locker-room-outburst)  &gt;Porter felt disrespected that his locker was moved, but the team source says that the decision was based on NBA seniority and spacing to adhere to COVID-19 protocols. The source said that Altman tried to settle him down and hear him out; however, Porter had none of it and ""pushed Koby past his breaking point."" **The argument kept escalating and Porter was heard yelling about ""modern-day slavery.""**  For context, in case anyone is unaware, the GM, Koby Altman, is black."

"Welp, imagine if you were still going to work (or had a job to go to for some Americans) and noticed your desk went from a nice window location to over by the restrooms without any notice. I bet you'd be pissed too.  The difference is *I* would go to my boss and find out WTF happened. My trust with the company would be diminished, but it's obvious they're sending a message to me so I couldn't act too crappy towards them.  .....He allegedly acted like my kid just did when I asked her to clean up her room.   This is why these young men gotta be disciplined earlier in life academically, socially, and on the court; you let talent cover up shit and it's going to eventually get exposed. The notion though that ANYONE wants Kevin Porter Jr right now is comical as I doubt anyone has time to babysit in 2021."
"Ah yes, the Cavaliers should beg for permission from Kevin Porter Jr. before doing absolutely anything at all lest they incur his whiny wrath and food throwing LMFAO. Give me a break."
"Dion actually made an impact in the league before all the other shit and even rebounded somewhat in Miami. Kevin Porter Jr has done nothing and unless he shapes up, he might as well just start trying to make a career for himself in Europe or China."
This would be the kind of content on ESPN if it got more views than the brainless talking head debate shows. This was posted on the sub around the same time Kevin Porter Jr throwing food in the cavs locker room was posted. That post has over 1k upvotes now and this one barely has 40 comments
"He felt disrespected from the CAVS, because he can dribble and put the ball in the bucket better than Taurean Prince in Kevin Porter Jr mind. Looks like he can't handle this situation as a mature adult, and he is finding out he is not that valuable to the CAVS."
"I want to know the extent of help they got him or tried to. There is a level effort from both sides, but the one side will quickly fall into ""we're trying to run a business"". I doubt the amount of help they tried to get him extended past that. Without being authoritarian and fascy there surely is a certain amount of imposition an NBA team can put on players. If they reached it and I'm wrong, fine. But I doubt they went above or beyond thinking of it a business. At a certain point they don't care about Kevin Porter Jr. at all. That can be said for all teams though. How far the care is differs. This feels low."

"When you put it in that context, it all makes sense. Imagine in grade school you sitting next to  a cute chick you are trying to get with then the mother fucking teacher moves your desk and now some other chum is hollering at her. In other words, Kevin Porter Jr is mature as a grade school kid."
"Here yall go:  &gt;CLEVELAND ‚Äî Cavaliers guard Kevin Porter Jr. is expected to be traded or released following an outburst Friday in the Cavs locker room, The Athletic has learned from several sources with direct knowledge of the events.  &gt;Porter, 20, who has not played this season due to personal issues, grew angry when he entered the locker room and realized the team gave his old locker to Taurean Prince, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade Wednesday.  &gt;Sources said Porter, whose locker was moved to the wall where the younger, end-of-bench players reside, began yelling and at one point threw food.  &gt;Sources said general manager Koby Altman came into the locker room and confronted Porter, and the player remained combative with his boss. The Cavs spent the weekend trying to trade him.  &gt;Coach J.B. Bickerstaff heard the commotion in the locker room from his office and came in, shocked and disgusted by what he heard.  &gt;Porter was involved in a one-car accident in November. He was arrested and charged with improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, failure to control the vehicle and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. All of those charges were dismissed. He was considered to be the most promising of Cleveland‚Äôs young players after last season. The Cavs were helping him get his life together before putting him back on the court.  &gt;Porter averaged 10 points and 3.2 rebounds as a rookie last year in 23.2 minutes per game. He shot 44.2 percent from the field and 33.5 percent from 3."

"Obligatory [Kevin Porter Jr. flexing while down ""a thousand points"".](https://youtu.be/8cQTg2U8me8)"
"&gt;The good people on r/clevelandcavs have theorized that the Cavs are shadow-tanking, as some players such as Sexton and Garland have been set to play for the last five or so games right before being scratched a couple minutes before tip-off. There have been some other shenanigan's such as Delly being out for over a month with a concussion (somewhat understandable), and there being no word on when KPJ is coming back. As for the other injuries, Kevin Love was expected to be out this long, Kevin Porter Jr is out for personal reasons, and Dylan Windler broke his hand."
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."

"&gt;""A team can say that they're trading you and then you have to 1. Stay in shape, and 2. Stay professional, and if not, his career is on the line. At some point, this league has to protect the player from embarrassment like that.""  Seeing the comments in this thread I'm probably going to get downvoted, but I have to say: I mean no shit? Your job is to stay in shape and be a professional. That's literally what it means to be a *professional athlete*. Of course your career is going to be on the line if you're not in shape (Bynum) or not a professional (Kevin Porter Jr.). You could argue that being in shape is part of being a professional but I digress.   I don't get why people in this thread are reacting like Draymond went on some next-level enlightening rant. His take is not even good? There is a reason Drummond isn't playing: it's to protect his health. Is the embarrassing part the fact that he came back out in street clothes? Like what, he should sit in uniform the whole game if he isn't going to play?"
"Idk how young you are but Iguodala has had a fantastic career...like I would bet tons of money Iguodala has a better career than Kevin Porter Jr. will even if he figures out off the court stuff.    2x all-defensive team, NBA finals MVP, few years as the best player on Philly averaging 19/6/6, with all-nba defense, etc.    It sorta makes no sense that you'd have an issue with Iggy on the list but not Jrue or Hayward.  Iggy has had a fantastic career"
Rafael Stone of the Rockets  - first year as GM  - navigated through the Harden drama  - signed Christian Wood (on track to be an all star)  - signed Jaesean Tate (on track to be all rookie)  - signed Kevin Porter Jr (averaging 27 in the G league)
I think Al Horford's contract is awful but he's rehabbing his trade value silently in OKC and some desperate contender will try to go for him.  Most supermax contracts are ass (Russ and John Wall). Kevin Love's is also particularly bad. At least Otto Porter Jr is an expiring.
"Knicks have suckkkked at drafting since Porzingis.   Obi Toppin over Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin Knox over Shae Gilgious Alexander, Michael Porter Jr and Mikal Bridges  Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo"
Kevin Porter Jr actually crashed a car and I hear about that less than Trae taking snapchats of himself. Find a new slant.
"Yup was hoping the Knicks at that point were gonna take Mikal Bridges or Porter Jr. but oh well...I knew Knox was a scrub from watching him on Kentucky, I knew his game wouldn‚Äôt translate, his skill is absent and he was just drafted purely on potential due to his Kevin Durant like frame."
"Thats exactly what I was getting at, just wanted to give that side of the coin. Ppl making fun of it cus they dont know what living like that might be like. Shit is chaotic out here for some ppl and they over here sitting cozy laughing at somebody that might actually have problems.  But pray for Kevin Porter Jr, and Kevin Love is such a standup guy for speaking up. Gang sign John Wall is one of my favorite players too and I love that Derozan is a crip. Fucking clowns"

Where was the rest of the league when Kevin Porter Jr got dumped for a poopy 2nd rounder?
"Overall I think the 3 firsts and 4 swaps from the nets is more valuable than Simmons. Just by viture of the fact at the very minimum the rockets have the rights to the nets picks until KD is 38 and Harden is 37 and will each be earning over 50 mil a year.   It's also not impossible for the nets to blow up by the end of next season when KD and Harden can opt out of their deals and leave in FA.  I agree the Allen and Levert part of the trades were poor but the rockets didn't want Allen so getting a frp (that theu pushed back a year later more likely for the bucks to blow up and got a swap in 2021 with their 2nd for Tucker) and essentially Kevin Porter Jr (Cavs likely gave them first crack at him because of the Allen deal) whilst dumping Prince was decent return. Then for Levert plus a 2nd round pick they got a player who will return assets next year in Bradley, a potential SNT candidate in Olynyk. And a first swap in 2022 I believe which will likely move the Rockets up 5 positions in the draft."
"Underrated one: Detroit delivering Bruce Brown on a platter cause he‚Äôs been really solid in Brooklyn  Also in 20 years, the Kevin Porter Jr trade will probably go down as one of the worst as context will probably die out and the man has potential to be a perennial superstar"

Kevin Porter Jr and Christian Wood are bright spots. Wall taking 30 shots a game is just jokes at this point.
"&gt;Even if they didn‚Äôt want to keep Ben imagine how big a trade package would be for him with 4 years on his contract?  Seriously, the basically gave away Lavert (after seeing the Dipo return) and Allen (while, Rocket fans believe it laid down the goodwill to get Kevin Porter Jr, KPJ was getting dumped no matter what)."
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
Kevin Porter Jr is pretty fun to watch. Im not saying he's must watch but he might be worth spending money on tickets to watch a year from now
I wanted Romeo Langford or Kevin Porter Jr. in that draft. I was thinking Herro was gonna go in the mid 20s or somethin lol.
"Kevin Porter Jr is a point guard man there‚Äôs no need to debate this, he plays the point when Wall isn‚Äôt there and our coaching staff has repeatedly said he‚Äôs our point guard. played SG or even SF because of situation"

The Alpha Chad Kevin Porter Jr vs the virgin beta trae young
Kevin Porter Jr. and now Evan Mobley (top 5 prospect for the upcoming draft). Both wore #4 at USC.
4 unprotected picks and 4 pick swaps is like one of the biggest hauls in NBA history   Also Stone is a great GM.  Signed Wood on a great contract  Signed Tate from the NLB  Traded for Kevin Porter Jr  Traded Harden and Westbrook to their preferred destination   Guaranteed Demarcus Cousins‚Äô contract
&gt;Why is a rookie who was picked 28th being talked about like this?  Because he's massively outperforming his draft position and the only reason he fell so hard was personality issues (similar to Kevin Porter Jr).
This right here. Cavs just moved on from Kevin Porter Jr. over his mentality. That guy has all the talent in the world and he's already on his second chance in the league.

smartest thing was definitely trading Kevin porter jr
Rockets young core is really good.  Kevin Porter Jr-20 years  Kenyon Martin-20 Years  Christian Wood- 25 years.  Plus they could get Cade Cunningham and have alot picks like OKC.
"All stats are more accurate when you have a larger sample size. That's kind of how stats work.   That's just common sense. But that's for stating the obvious.   Now I know that Kevin Porter Jr. doesn't average 50 points a game.   But if you think +/- doesn't matter in individual games, then I suggest you start kicking down all the windmills on this subreddit, because people point out single game +/- with significant frequency on this sudreddit."
"You‚Äôre so clueless lmao  You might not like the Harden trade, but LeVert, even if he had a good game, is still a really inneficient scorer his whole career.  Hes also 26, so hes not going to be part of our future, but with his shot profile would take oportunities away from young guys  We took Oladipo because we thought he was the better player, and he left us flexible to start tanking next season when we own out picks. In hindsight it looks bad but back then it really didnt. When we took Oladipo they were about the same efficiency but Oladipo was a much better defender.  At the end of the day we got Olynyk, who might leave in the offseason but for this year has been a lot better than LeVert has been, at least for us, and has been an excelent veteran and is really good friends with KPJ  Now saying the FO is incompetent when they nailed the 52nd pick in KJ Martin, got Tate as an UDFA and hes a top 5 rookie, got Christian Wood for 13M a year and got Kevin Porter Jr for free is actually mind blowing lol"

Kevin Porter Jr is just following orders
Seems like everyone here knows who Kevin Porter Jr. is. I have zero clue.
"I'm not shitting on the kid, and I hope he continues to ball out. But it was one game. Dude has gone over 20, only 9 times out of 22 appearances this season. Shot over 45%, 9 times this season. I hope he balls out but to act like he's the next big thing after one great game is kinda ridiculous. I'd be happy for him if people think my comment ages like milk and he becomes James Harden 2.0, but he still has a lot to prove.  Average for the season, for reference.    Player | PTS | REB | AST | STL | BLK | TOV | FG% | 3PT% | FT% | TS% ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Kevin Porter Jr. | 15.2 | 3.8 | 6.2 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 3.5 | 41.1 | 28.7 | 76.1| 51.0 |"
Kevin Porter Jr can legitimately be the best shooting guard in the league
I thought this was Michael Porter Jr till I read the comments. Who the hell is Kevin Porter Jr?!
It‚Äôs basically like dropping 80. Kevin finally overtook Michael in the porter jr rankings
That‚Äôs Kevin Porter Jr. levels of production.
Youngest to have a 50 point double double w assists and 4th youngest to reach a 50 point game.  Brandon Jennings - 20 years old and 52 days  Lebron James - 20 years old and 80 days and again at 20 years old and 345 days  Devin Booker - 20 years old and 145 days  Kevin Porter Jr. - 20 years old and 360 days

Kevin Porter Jr. gotta stop going to strip clubs man
Kevin Porter Jr plays alot like Harden  Also Trae last year
"I mean if we keep our draft pick then it‚Äôll be pretty nice next season  Kevin Porter Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr., Jae‚ÄôSean Tate, Christian Wood, plus 2-3 rookies"
It's G-League stats. So no. Go check out the Top 10 scorers for the regular season....none of those guys (except Kevin Porter Jr) get anything but garbage time minutes (if any at all) on their respective NBA teams.
Devin Booker went 13 and even looking at Kevin Porter Jr. rn who fell to 30 is kind of crazy
kevin porter jr and k mart jr bro

"&gt;*Some Rockets players had started filing out of the Booby Trap strip club prior to the incident, but a couple of them who remained ‚Äî including the team‚Äôs talented young guard Kevin Porter Jr. ‚Äî also stepped into the altercation as a way to protect Brown and remove him from the situation, according to sources. Porter was also roughed up a bit by the individuals, those sources said, but was fine and played Monday night against the Heat (18 points, three assists, 31 minutes).*  I feel bad for Sterling, but I'm disappointed that he and the other players seemingly played around with COVID protocol to look at T&amp;A, and even more saddened they did this with KPJ, who seems to be trying to get his life on track. ^((I know KPJ is grown, but older players can shape the behavior of young players.)) I wouldn't be surprised if the FO and/or league wants to hand out 1-game suspensions to everyone who went to that jiggle joint, but can't b/c they wouldn't have the minimum amt of players for that game."
"Kevin Porter Jr was not part of the James Harden trade, stop it.  They also had this years protected pick regardless of the Harden trade so that's not relevant either."
they got Kevin Porter Jr in a completely unrelated trade
And a bunch of draft capital and Kevin Porter Jr. and a 52% chance at a new 'franchise' player.  But even so... Just Olynyk for Harden is pretty much a push.
"While KD has a longer wingspan, they‚Äôre the same height  Don‚Äôt believe me? Just google Micheal Porter jr vs Kevin Durant"

"Really? I mean, where do I begin...  We haven't had two big men for most of the season. We played Oladipo a huge chunk of minutes every night for most of the year just so his value wouldn't tank, despite having outright better players at his position. Our best wings have been outplayed and replaced by a 26 year old rookie. Our other wings have been injured. Wall misses every other game and Gordon has missed most of the year.  These are just a handful of reasons we've been terrible this season, without getting into the most obvious one...it most certainly has not been because of Kevin Porter Jr, though. He has played spectacular basketball since we called him up (and don't think we feel a need to prop up our players, we cut Mason Jones who was in a similar spot)"
"you compared 20 year old Kevin Porter Jr on his second season in the league playing a completely diferent position, point guard   To 26 year old LeVert in his 5th year of being the exact same shit hes ever been.  One has potential, the other one we know what he is.  Tates ceiling is a role player, the ages of those dont matter, timeline only matters on your core players, Im not even sure Wood fits the timeline, but hes on a cheap deal, long term, and has room to improve as this is basically his rookie season when it comes to actually getting minutes and reps on a team, LeVert has had that for half a decade. As I said in a diferent comment, im down to sell high on Wood if we are further away than we think we are by next years trade deadline."

"After I saw Kevin Porter Jr abuse Jrue for 50, I started to doubt Jrue‚Äôs defensive prowess. Looking at the advanced stats, his DBPM has always been poor. I feel like he‚Äôs a bit overrated as a defender. Good defender but not some shutdown guy he‚Äôs advertised as."
Kevin Porter Jr  Michael Porter Jr  Damion Porter Jr ( #1 8th grader in Illinois)
"In the short term I think so. He plays with a chip on his shoulder and has stated before that he wants to prove he's worth a max contract at the end of this contract, this team gives him a great opportunity for that because he will be very key in the offense. I'm not sure he will get the same opportunity to be quite as involved on a competing team. I don't know that his primary goal is winning a championship right now as much as proving himself as a player. One more season of development/tanking I don't think will bother him. He'll also be just about to turn 28 at the end of his contract which is a perfect timeline for him to earn a max if he's ever going to.   But that third and final season of his contract could be key, the 22-23 season. If we don't start showing signs by then of at least being on track to become a playoff team then I wouldn't be surprised at him leaving to go elsewhere at the end of his contract. And really at that point if he's indicating that, we should consider trading him because his bird rights will be very valuable to a competing team, not to mention the potential playoff boost he'd give for that season without having to match much salary to get him. My hope as a Rockets fan is that we are looking good at that point between the hopefully top 4 rookie we draft this year and our young guys developing.  The 22-23 season is going to be huge for us in general. Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, and Jae'Sean Tate will all be up and they are right now basically our future core. We'll also have a ton of cap room because John Wall will be finally off the books and Eric Gordon's contract goes unguaranteed so we could cut him if we wanted."
Send Kevin Porter JR you cowards
"I think its plausible. I don‚Äôt see Houston getting better in the next two/three years unless Kevin Porter Jr. turns into James Harden 2.0. So I fully expect Houston to go full tank. They took Wall, an objectively worse injury prone player, for Westbrook. Why not take Porzingis?  I genuinely think Christian Wood would be a really good fit with Luka. Gordon could be a secondary ball handler or if they don‚Äôt want one or both of them they can be flipped for assets because their contracts are much more manageable."

"Kevin Porter Jr, even without that whole Miami hate that's going on rn. I just think KPJ is a lot more talented, his athleticism also unlocks a whole new dimension for him. His attitude is ""questionable"", but so was Cousins', that's something you can work around."
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
Only guys (from the 40 highly-paid players this season) that might be in the conversation for that title are Otto Porter Jr and Kevin Love.
Kevin Porter Jr is a millionaire
"It‚Äôs a different Kevin Porter, completely unrelated to Kevin Porter Jr"
"&gt;Compared to the dozens of top FA lining up to sign in Seattle  They cannot lineup with no franchise.  That said, Zach LaVine, Dejounte Murray, and Kevin Porter, Jr are all from Washington.  Any two of those three might be a real decent backcourt.  &gt;They have a better shot of recruiting players in LA than Seattle, this is common sense  In 20 years of Sonics' basketball during the UFA era, their record was not that much worse than the Clippers' record in 32 years.  The Sonics signed Terry Cummings, Vernon Maxwell, and Chuck Person, among others.  And that was without Ballmer's nearly bottomless funds."

Let's not act like Kevin Porter Jr. is a typical G-League player. He got drafted in the first round and only got sent down because of being traded for team issues.
It completely depends. Kevin Porter Jr was the leading scorer and he wasn't auditioning to be a janitor. He was auditioning for the job of tank commander.

I thought KPJ did have to miss games. I dont follow rockets but it says here he missed 3 games due to protocol.

"There's literally three different Porter Jr.'s in the NBA right now. The acronym isn't a sign of noteworthiness, it's a sign that typing Porter Jr. can get confusing and typing Kevin Porter Jr. every time is a hassle."

I can explain the difference if you dont understand.
"Lol.   ""Many players have missed games this season due to the protocols ‚Äì    because of contact tracing or a positive test. But Porter is apparently    being held out because he violated the protocols.""

Then it was because of contact tracing.  Now that those are both wrong whats next?"
Yeah superstars like LeBron and Kevin Porter Jr always get away with that kind of thing.
You don't automatically get a suspension for violating them. Kevin Porter Jr went to a strip club in Miami and just got fined. Were you in your feelings about that too?
Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr are not that good. They are young players averaging decent counting stats on weak efficiency with little defense on two completely terrible teams.  There is no world where a team is better with Garland than Derrick Rose.

"since when can players only attend nba sanctioned events? nba eased the rules on social gatherings not too long ago and if it's true that everyone was either vaccinated or negative, lebron shouldn't be suspended. kevin porter jr went to a club full of people and didn't get suspended, why should lebron be?"
"&gt;Porter Jr. has since rejoined the Rockets as Houston‚Äôs starter at point guard, though he missed three games due to the protocols. The related $50,000 fine effectively closes the book on his consequences.  https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/04/28/nba-fines-kevin-porter-jr-as-probe-of-rockets-strip-club-visit-ends/"
"&gt; Kevin Porter Jr was at the strip club and didn‚Äôt get in trouble  This is what I responded to.   I know there is a difference, but it is a lie to say KPJ didn't get in trouble."
"&gt; Kevin Porter Jr was at the strip club and didn‚Äôt get in trouble  My point is that he absolutely did.  I don't think Lebron should get suspended. I just think the league should have updated protocols before this instead of just announcing that they have decided not to enforce them.  &gt;all vaccinated event  Small correction, it was vaccinated or recent negative test."
"Stupid take, they didn't suspend Kevin Porter Jr either"
What do they let him get away with? I‚Äôm genuinely asking. This event was outside and he‚Äôs vaccinated. I don‚Äôt see the big deal at all. Kevin Porter Jr was at the strip club and didn‚Äôt get in trouble
There‚Äôs a front page post about Kevin Porter Jr. just getting fined for breaking protocol by going to a **strip club**. Is the NBA bending over for nba superstar Kevin Porter Jr.?
"You mean like [Kevin Porter Jr?](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nipy1b/kevin_porter_jr_went_to_a_strip_club_violated/).  They didn't suspend Lebron because it wasn't a big violation, and they wouldn't suspend some random role player either for the same thing.  Not all violations are the same, this is a minor one requiring some minor punishment, that's it.  The only reason we're talking about it is because its Lebron and other teams like to make a big deal out of him getting favorable treatment."
"&gt;Theres already been players this year who violated protocol and didn't get suspended.  My guess is that many people didn't know this. I certainly didn't know it. That said, the punishment should fit the crime. Maybe Kevin Porter Jr got off easy and should've missed a game."
Because I'd rather type KPJ than Kevin Porter Jr and there's not really anyone else you could confuse KPJ for
"I would argue only player had a definitively better season than Curry and that would be Jokiƒá. Homer opinion but deal with it. I think a large part of Curry's incredible success depends on the lack of any other offensive help he had for the season and that showed when he really ramped up later in the season to fill the void. I'm also of the opinion every nba player is capable of 25 a night in the right situation, look at Jerami Grant. And about half the league is capable of a 50 point performance on their best night, look at Kevin Porter Jr.  So his great season is more of a function of the lack of talent on the Warriors.  The numbers for the past season would not agree, but I would argue that Harden, AD, and Embiid are all better players. I would also posit that LeBron and KD are also similarly talented that you could put them higher or lower than Steph. None of these guys had the statistical season that Steph did, but they're seasons all led to an opportunity to win the Larry OB. The fans of the NBA are ridiculously obsessed with individual statistics as a way of determining who the best is, but I believe that team success is a better measure. It shows how much an individual can improve the players around them. Steph didn't make any of his teammates that much better this season. LeBron, Harden and Jokiƒá always do, Embiid and AD are such talented defenders it makes their teammates lives much easier. KD and Steph are different from the others because they create for themselves at a much more elite level, but don't have as much impact on the improvement of their teammates on either side of the ball. Steph still had Kerr and Green, so the potential was there for more success.  Don't take this as unnecessary Steph hate, he's no question a top 15 player ever, likely top 10 and I'd even listen to an argument that he's top 5. An incredible offensive season that doesn't result in playoffs doesn't mean much the same way going 73-9 without a ring doesn't mean much."
"Kyrie broke protocol twice to go to birthday parties, he faced almost no consequences, neither did Kevin Porter Jr. Even the little consequences they faced, it was in the regular season.  This is the fucking playoffs, why would anyone want players to miss games because of this? LeBron attended a fully covid-tested event. I want all players to be healthy and available for the playoffs. Anyone rooting for players to be suspended or miss games is a fucking clown."
"KPJ missed 1 week of games because of this. This post is a weak attempt in trying to change the narrative.  https://twitter.com/ClutchPointsApp/status/1384996058732793859   [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/31305880/houston-rockets-kevin-porter-jr-violated-nba-health-safety-protocol-strip-club-visit](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31305880/houston-rockets-kevin-porter-jr-violated-nba-health-safety-protocol-strip-club-visit)  &gt;Houston Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr. ***will miss time*** because of a violation of the NBA's health and safety protocols stemming from visiting a Miami strip club with teammate Sterling Brown that resulted in Brown being assaulted, sources told ESPN.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;***Porter likely will be out until at least Sunday***, Rockets coach Stephen Silas said prior to Wednesday's game against the Utah Jazz. The NBA's health and safety protocols limit where players can go while on the road."
Because unlike Kevin porter Jr LeKaren is not vaccinated
Kevin porter jr didn‚Äôt lol
I think you mean Michael Porter Jr and Kevin Porter Jr
That is inaccurate. Breaking protocol alone doesn‚Äôt require a 14 day quarantine. Kevin Porter Jr for example broke protocol and was fined $50k but no 14 day quarantine for that incident at the Miami strip club
If he played in a bigger market he‚Äôd get that notoriety.  I feel like people heard more about Kevin Porter Jr than Ja Morant this season just because he‚Äôs a Rocket.
Editors note: an earlier version of this story had Kevin Porter Jr giving the speech in the locker room..we have since been informed that this was at a strip club
"‚ÄúDuring an impassioned speech, in the middle of the season after a loss, Kevin Porter Jr. told the Rockets that they were going to make the playoffs despite all the injuries, the Harden ordeal, and losing streaks. They proceeded to go 17-55 and end up with the worst record in the league.‚Äù"
"This.  Seriously, it would set a bad precedent for teammates if Porter, Jr got away with throwing a [hissy fit](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30735990/sources-cleveland-cavaliers-look-trade-waive-kevin-porter-jr-outburst) over that.  And before everyone chimes in with what about Kevin Love, well, there were literally like a [hundred million reasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/loveke01.html#all_all_salaries) to keep him on the roster after his insubordination."
Kevin Porter Jr if he gets the right playing time with the Rockets. Guy spends a lot of time with Chris Brickley working on his game and saw flashes of it at the end of this season
"&gt;Houston may take a look depending on what they do in the draft.  Houston wanted him, they wouldn't have given him away.  Well that favor got them Kevin Porter Jr I guess, but I doubt they really saved that much considering the Cavs were desperate to move him.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest are good options and I guess we'll see what happens."
"I wish the NBA would start listing player heights to the quarter inch.  It's weird seeing players like Kevin Durant and Michael Porter Jr being listed at the same height when one guy definitely looks taller because he is 6'10.25"" and the other is 6'9.5""."
When he was on the court in the g-league he was probably the best player out there. You could see how unrefined and sloppy the newbies were but Jeremy knew his job and played like a pro and true vet compared to them. I would say the only other player in the g-league who out did him was when Kevin Porter Jr of the Rockets was down there. He made the Santa Cruz Warriors better and imo if Jordan Poole had stayed down there during the playoffs they would have won.

I still can't believe they got Harden for virtually nothing outside of Kevin Porter Jr. The equivalent of this would be like the 76ers getting Giannis for Tyrese Maxey and scraps.
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron‚Äôs effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie‚Äôs exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron‚Äôs people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA‚Äôs other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn‚Äôt pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
"prolly because of non-basketball related things, just like kevin porter jr."
"&gt; Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Jae'Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Armoni Brooks  That team with ben simmons is still headed to the lottery, the team would still get decent draft position and have a three time all star point guard who turns 25 in july"
"Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Jae'Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Armoni Brooks"
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
Kevin Porter Jr. will be an All-NBA type player starting this season.
Keldon Johnson  Kevin Porter Jr  Cam Reddish
"Wouldn‚Äôt say they have ‚Äú0 talent‚Äù Kevin Porter Jr., Christian Wood, and JaeSean Tate all seem like hoopers. That‚Äôll be a good core around Jalen Green or whoever Houston picks"
"2019 draft class might have one of the best tail ends of a first round ever. Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, and Kevin Porter Jr have all massively overperformed for their draft positions."
"Kevin Porter Jr., Zion, Dlo, Randle, De'aaron Fox, Sabonis"
Giannis and who?   Brogdon literally was favor to his agent. They had no intention of drafting him. They didn't care about the 46 pick so they just used if for a favor for an agent. One reason Brogdon was never really happy with the organization and wanted to leave.  Norman powell not our pick. kevin porter jr. also not our pick.  Thon Maker major miss. Rashad Vaughn miss. D.J. Wilson miss. Jabari Parker major miss.   Donte was a solid pick at 17.  Our contracts in the early Giannis area were more terrible however.
"I'm sorry, I'm probably just being whooshed. But the Bucks aren't good at drafting? They've drafted 2 first ballot hall of famers in the last 25 years. Also, aside from that, they drafted malcolm brogdon recently, who turned out to be a very good player. Also, as for just functional nba players, they drafted kevin porter jr., norman powell, and donte divincenzo since giannis got drafted. All three were drafted after the 16th pick of the draft. I would say they've done a great job drafting. That said, the trade makes complete sense and I really hope they win the championship."
"On Apr 29, Kevin Porter Jr put up 50/5/11 in a win against the bucks. But that‚Äôs not the biggest statistical anomaly that game.   What‚Äôs not known is that in the 46 seconds that Giannis played before leaving with an injury, he put up 1 pt (1/2 ft), 1ast, and 1stl. Giving him a BPM of‚Ä¶   Wait for it‚Ä¶  +111.4  So yeah"
You could have kevin porter jr. on there too. Puts up some exciting offensive showings on the box score but half the rockets games I watch he's walking and in the wrong spot on D
Except for Kevin Porter Jr. Right? Right?
Kevin Porter Jr that high is just hilariously bad
"Of course the FO botched it. They run a 8-man roster for the last 20 games of the season, with injury after injury and 2-3 empty roster slots. Virtually any veteran minimum replacement for Oubre would've meant a playoff run.  Didn't spend an dollar after the Oubre signing. Wasted Klay's DPE without spending an extra cent.  &gt; There is no one to blame but the Front Office. Everyone knew that Wiseman would be a project player with insanely high upside. They chose him knowing that it would take a few years to get him to where he needed to be. Once Klay got injured, half of the fan base went from confident to uncertain. Wiseman is a scapegoat for the failings of the front office. If the Warriors trade him, I‚Äôm certain everyone will look back and laugh at how dumb they were.  &gt; They failed to trade Oubre before the deadline. They didn‚Äôt get Kevin Porter Jr. while his stock was at rock bottom. They didn‚Äôt get Austin Rivers in free agency. There is so much that they could have done to help Steph, but they didn‚Äôt.  Dedmon was also available and played big playoffs minutes for Miami  https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ol4mnn/sandretto_steve_kerr_to_me_the_most_interesting/h5cfjov/"

Irrelevant. You get the wrong guy on the wrong day who wants the NBA‚Äôs Bobby Riggs and the WNBA would be exposed. Even worse if its someone like Kevin Porter Jr who PROBABLY wont be anything more than a consistent starting guard in the league physically dominating the WNBA‚Äôs best post player
Kevin Porter Jr
"Spurs get:   * 3rd overall pick  * 2023 1st, top-10 protected  * Kevin Love  Cavaliers get:   * Dejounte Murray  * Derrick White  * 12th overall pick   This is the sort of deal that might entice the Cavs to trade their pick. They get a very good young PG, a solid SG, and a low lotto pick for the crown jewel of the trade (3rd overall), another, protected 1st, and a salary dump (Love). Dejounte pairs well with Darius and White would be a great third guard for them. Plus, they can still get someone promising with the 12th pick. A protected 1st isn't much to dump Love and balance the deal, either.  Spurs do it to get a top tier prospect as well as a veteran who pairs well next to Poeltl. They're guaranteed one of Green/Mobley/Suggs with that pick. Probably either Mobley or Suggs, since top two looks to be Cade and Green. They get a prospect who can be their centerpiece for the future. They also get another first to help them down the line.   Use their cap space wisely on a PG this offseason and some vets for the bench, and they'll still be competitive next season. Something like Dinwiddie or Scroeder /Vassell/Keldon/Love/Poeltl with Patty, (Porter Jr?), Mobley as your first guys off the bench. Maybe they are able to sign two starters, so they also get a SG or SF. Maybe Oladipo or Josh Richardson would come for an overpay."

"Rockets are going to take Green I bet. Which is why I don't get why they're moving Sexton.   But your line of thinking is actually the exact opposite of what the Cavs want to do if they get Green. You pair Garland-Green, not Sexton-Green. Sexton is an undersized SG, not a PG, while Garland is a more traditional point to pair with Green.   Also, I can't believe they gave away Kevin Porter Jr. for literally nothing. Watch the Rockets pair KPJ and Green and be successful."
"Honestly as fun as he is to watch play, I'd like to sell high on Kevin Porter Jr."
Kevin Porter Jr will get good minutes for the rockets next season I could see him breaking out next year
Kevin Porter Jr. Rockets giving him the green light and if we get Jalen Green; that backcourt could be dangerous.
Kevin Porter Jr
And Kevin Porter Jr
"&gt; He seems to have a relationship with Kevin Porter Jr., they already have a center too.  The Rockets just blew up their franchise and had the worst record in the league.  They can't think like that at all.  Wood only has 2 years left on his deal - at which point he's a UFA and could go anywhere.  And KPJ is a 2-guard who can't shoot - pleasing him is not exactly critical.  Rockets will take whomever they believe will be the best franchise cornerstone of the two, as either one immediately becomes the most important long-term player on the roster.  The rebuild happens around that guy."
"The Rockets are more likely to take Jalen Green. He seems to have a relationship with Kevin Porter Jr., they already have a center too.   If I‚Äôm the Cavaliers, I pick the best player remaining between Mobley or Green. Then trade away Sexton"

Kevin Porter Jr is the best and most promising player on the roster now. Pretty bleak
"This man learned from the Ben Shapiro school of thought. ""Sit"" lmao. The 7-75 Hornets would not even make the playoffs so no they wouldn't be able to do what LeBron did in the finals.    I could use this shitty logic and say ""Even LeBron could lose to the Hall of Fame Celtics every first round. Even the current Rockets could do that. Does that make Kevin Porter Jr. the GOAT? Nope."""
That's fair. If Kevin Porter Jr was a rookie this year he'd probably be on here. But the value after rookie year drops pretty steeply so at that point you're looking at who will be more collectible long term and there's no guarantee he ends up better than DeRozan. Though I do like his game a lot.
I would rather have a Kevin Porter Jr than a DeMar DeRozan.   (card)
Seems like Green's stock has risen to be the #2 guy at the very least.  I don't know how to feel about the fit of Mobley and Wood on the Rockets - both strike me as guys that don't have enough bulk to protect the rim.  I'm also not sold on Mobley's fit on the Cavs either; Love is deadweight obviously but they're probably going to extend Allen and Larry Nance Jr is a super solid stretch 4.   Would the Cavs trade Sexton and #3 for #2? I guess that would depend on Houston not being super high on Green and if they have faith in Kevin Porter Jr being their big point guard of the future.
Kevin Porter Jr and his gang shit  JR Smith drunk and drove and killed his friend   Ty Lawson literally out the league for being perpetually drunk all the time
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
"Mikal Bridges can develop all three levels of scoring - spot up, pull up and at the rim, in a really short time : my opinion it will happen in next two seasons. And another: Poetl will become better at defending in space and become dpoy level impact defender (already elite rim protector, but struggle in defending space aka pnr) And another one: Ntilikina is nba  level player and he should play as shooting guard #FREENTILIKINA Michael Porter Junior will be next Kevin Durant Houston will be contenders(i hope they draft Mobley) nex season, Kenyon Martin Jr will be in the race for Most improved player and Khyri Thomas is nba level player his defense is insane. Utah need better defenders to be the true contenders- Gobert cant hold whole defense on his own and Utah failure is not his fault Raptors will be back stronger than ever and B mis season be title favorites"
Shit it‚Äôs better than building around Kevin porter jr or Christian wood
"Only issue is that I think trading Wood to GSW for Wiseman and the 14th pick would be a win win, but rockets can't do that if they have Mobley. Idk who the Rockets could take because rn there assets are Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and he doesn't fit great with Jalen Green and I think Suggs or Kuminga at 2 is a mistake but idk."
"Perfect:   Whoever we draft becomes a possible franchise cornerstone and wins ROY. Love accepts his role as a mentor, has a healthy season, his name is tossed around for 6th MOY, is at his best place mentally.  Okuro develops a decent jump shot, improves, either dean wade or windler become the next joe Harris, sexton or garland make ""the jump"", named all star, (like young/Lillard/Booker status ) lead cavs to a 6th seed and we lose in the second round against eventual NBA champs, the nets.   Realistic: our 3rd pick averages 11.9 ppg on &lt;40 Fg%, Sexton and garland both slightly improve but it's still unclear which one we build around (both?) and how green/suggs all fit in with the guard rotation. We pay Allen 4/86 with 4th yr player option. Media focuses on sexton's contract situation all year and it's not resolved. Love plays 60 games, averages 12/6.   Worst: Cavs overpay on sexton and Allen, giving them 30+ mil/yr contracts, draft suggs who is a defensive sieve and looks awful, Kevin Porter Jr wins MIP, averages 22/3/5. Love plays 40-55 games averages 7.8ppg."
Kevin Porter Jr got it locked up sadly  Maybe 2023
Kevin Porter Jr over Harden
Kevin Porter Jr or whoever we draft
Yea I would even go as far to say if Kevin Porter Jr was still on the team Sexton would be the 3rd best on the team
Koby Altman has the market cornered on terrible trades. Joe Harris for a second and Kevin Porter Jr for literally nothing. This dude is in a league of his own

Kevin Porter Jr
"Kevin Porter Jr, although it was abundantly clear that he was a lottery guy that dropped because of his off the court issues"
Thybulle will have the best career  Kevin Porter Jr will be the best player
"Also, with Detroit, they will likely get another high selection tomorrow, along with the fact that they‚Äôre very willing to take up reclamation projects (see Jahlil Okafor, Dennis Smith Jr, etc). Their willingness to do that, such as Houston did with Kevin Porter Jr, could lead to them finding multiple gems though smart deals. Plus, they have a lot of seconds to work with thanks to the Cory Joseph and other trades."
If we land Cade Cunningham tomorrow then why not trade Simmons for John Wall? It‚Äôs clear that Sixers need an actual point guard.   Christian Wood as your stretch center. Ben Simmons as your point forward. JaSean Tate as small forward. Cade Cunningham and Kevin Porter Jr as your guards. Young team. Simmons gets a clean slate and can get help from John Lucas. Stephen Silas can start with a younger core and hopefully develop the team into a real contender.
Go ahead and add Kevin Porter Jr to the Cavs‚Äô list  Can‚Äôt believe we traded him and Joe Harris for nothing
"Houston looking like absolute prophets when they trade Kevin Porter Jr, Eric Gordon and a 2nd round pick for Ben and a 1st"
"2016: none 2017: none 2018: devontae graham, deanthony Melton 2019: Kevin porter jr 2020: tyrese Halliburton, CJ Elleby  Our bad picks really aren‚Äôt the issue"
"Kevin Porter Jr dropped 50 on Jrue Holiday, but Kevin Durant could only manage 48? Scrub."
Ever since Jrue got 50 dropped on his head by Kevin porter jr. I‚Äôve always tried to pay attention to his defense during games and tbh he really doesn‚Äôt do anything that sticks out to me defensively‚Ä¶ idk
"Everyone is asking that about Kevin Porter Jr. too, when a young guy has a game like that, it's gonna turn heads"
"The Rockets and it's not even close.  1. Wall's contract is the worst in the league. 2. The Harden trade was a debacle. They walked away with zero young good players and picks from the team of one of the richest owners in the NBA. 3. Christian Wood and Kevin Porter, Jr. are their potential All Star players and both have weird drama in their background. 4. The rest of the roster is players that never panned and older players with little trade value. 5. Their owner is the #1 most likely owner to be forced to sell. He is spiteful, illogical, and will probably run their franchise like a baseball team that makes money and basically farms players for contenders. His financial issues and attitude will trickle down into their organization as he continuously hires the cheapest front office and coaching talent. They are the next perennial bottom feeder of the West. 6. If they do turn it around and start getting better, OKC will have a lot their first round draft capital.  Edit: spelling"
Kevin Porter Jr  Jordan Poole  Rui  Nickeil Alexander Walker
1- Kyrie Irving  2- Klay Thompson  3- Michael Porter Jr  4- Kevin Durant  5- Nikola Jokic  Contenders for the greatest offense of all time lol
"I don't think anyone is sleeping on the Hornets, but I think they'll be as good as the 6th seed, floor is 9th. Graham being gone might actually help them not have a log jam at guard, but I looked him on this team.  I think the Rockets and Pacers are good sleepers.  I really like the players the Rockets have like Christian Wood, John Wall, Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr among others, and their head coach.  I don't like how the roster had played over the last few seasons for the Pacers, but Rick Carlisle is a big reason why I think they could surprise people.   I want to say the Magic so bad, but Jonathan Isaac will be out a lot of the season, but Fultz is coming back with Cole and Suggs. They still have Ross and MCW off the bench too, but I know nothing about Jamahl Mosley"
PG: Simmons  SG: SGA  SF: Kevin Porter Jr.  PF: Jayson Tatum   C: Mitchell Robinson  And they'd still have Embiid on the team
Christian Wood  Jalen Green  Alperen Sengun  Kevin Porter Jr  Usman Garuba  Kenyon Martin Jr  Armoni Brooks  Jae‚ÄôSean Tate   Josh Christopher
Rockets:   - Jalen Green - Alperen Sengun - Usman Garuba - Josh Christopher - Kevin Porter JR - Christian Wood - Jae'sean Tate - KJ Martin
Is KPG Kevin porter jr? Or is there a rockets player I don't know about?
"He‚Äôs decent when healthy, it‚Äôs just annoying cause Kevin Porter Jr averaged like 18/7 when Wall was hurt and we want him to start at point guard"
"The Rockets are perhaps the best team in the league at rehabilitating players plagued with off court issues. And that‚Äôs because of their former #1 pick and current assistant coach, John Lucas II. [He dealt with addiction during his career, beat it, and opened a clinic in Houston to help athletes going through it.](https://theundefeated.com/features/rockets-assistant-coach-john-lucas/) It may not have been publicized, but he‚Äôs probably helped a player from your team at some point. This is why Rockets fans think Houston is the best place for Kevin Porter Jr to be (both for his career and as a human)."
"You could‚Äôve had someone like Cam Reddish, Coby White, Keldon Johnson or Kevin Porter Jr and went with Culver thats hilarious LMFAO"
I found that out during the Kevin Porter Jr trade lol
I don't know about Green but wasn't Porter [accused of assaulting a woman](https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/kevin-porter-jr-accusations/95-83c28b95-626d-40e1-a31b-7e0e1cdac18f)?    He also had [some problems with the Cavs](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/01/18/cavaliers-trade-release-kevin-porter-jr-locker-outburst) which is how the Rockets were able to get him for so little.
Kevin Porter Jr will be a superstar.
"I don‚Äôt understand what you expect from Kyrie then. The only time he didn‚Äôt have an all star on his team was his first 3 years in the league when the cavs were a poverty franchise. That‚Äôs your sample size, him at 20 years old playing with a trash team. It‚Äôs basically like penalizing Collin Sexton or Kevin Porter Jr. because they aren‚Äôt winning all on their own, while their team is abysmal.   I‚Äôm also curious what your definition of a ‚Äúwinning player‚Äù is. Kyrie has done very well for himself as a second option, and certainly played winning basketball in the 2016 and 2017 playoffs. Is it only when you have 0 other all stars and do it by yourself that you are a ‚Äúwinning player?‚Äù If so then there‚Äôs only been a handful of those in history"

Kevin porter Jr for sure.  Dude has a bag
Kevin Porter Jr.
"I think Kevin Porter Jr. Is gonna be a monster. Idk if people agree or see his personality similar to JR's after their separate incidents with staff in Cleveland.  I believe, even with Jalen Green, KPJ is gonna have a monster season and end up winning most improved"
"This is probably my #1, along with Kevin Porter Jr., Rui Hachimura, Dejounte Murray, and my homeboys, Bey and Stewart."
Kevin Porter Jr.
"Michael Porter Jr, Kevin Porter Jr"

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"KPJ (Kevin Porter Jr. for the acronymically-challenged) rolled his car and the cops found weed in it when he was playing for the Cavs, and somehow he went home with no charges of any kind. I think sometimes it's more being an athlete than having lots of money (he was a second-rounder)."

"1. LeBron‚Äòs championship window is closed.  2. Harden, Luka, and Trae will be completely fine with the new rule changes, but Embiid and Butler will have worse seasons than they did in 2021 as a result of them.  3. Jayson Tatum is not a fringe top-10 player. He‚Äôs not clearly ahead of any of Booker, Beal, Trae, and Mitchell. Those 5 are close to interchangeable. His defensive edge is not great enough to clear him from the other 4, who are significantly better playmakers.  4. The Blazers organization has failed to surround Damian Lillard with sufficient talent, but he should also be held accountable for their postseason woes. He is one of the worst defenders in the NBA, and his playmaking is a significant notch below that of other elite point guards (Steph, Luka, Harden, Trae, CP3). He can be an excellent second option, but can‚Äôt be the centerpiece of a championship team.  5. Julius Randle‚Äôs 2021 season was an anomaly, and it will have been his peak.  6. Michael Porter Jr. is not a max-extension worthy player yet. He is a lights-out shooter, but his IQ lapses and inability to become an elite defender (injury limitations) will be a problem for him and the Nuggets in the future.  7. Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson are the two most overrated players in NBA history.  8. Kevin Garnett at his peak was better than Tim Duncan at his peak.  9. Stephen Curry is the best offensive player ever.  10. The Suns will win the 2022 NBA Championship."

Good for fantasy basketball and draftkings! Other than that he looked like a shell of himself he's going to be that old vet in a rotation soon enough. Especially now that Kevin porter Jr and Jalen Green will need all the PT if they want to win some games

Kevin Porter Jr
Just another KP in the mix I mean. Maybe Otto Porter Jr.? Kevin Huerter? None of them are actually that close but between all the overlapping acronyms and suffixes imagine trying to call a game with that team.
 Also Kenyon Martin Jr. and Kevin Porter Jr. which somehow manages to confuse me every time.
"Gotta go with my man Stone... In less than one year, the Rockets went from Harden/Westbrook/Covington led team to a young core of:  Christian Wood Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr. Jae'sean Tate Alperen Sengun Usman Garuba Joshua Christopher  And a crapload of future 1st round picks/swaps."
"No, Christian Wood is the perfect age for where he can be a part of the youth movement while being a bonafide leader/1st option.   He‚Äôll be 26 in September and will be entering/in his prime by the time guys like Jalen Green/Kevin Porter Jr. truly break out. He‚Äôs awesome value at around $13 million a year."
Kevin Porter Jr‚Ä¶. Book it
Don't care Chris Paul decided he wanted to spend a year in Oklahoma that's on him. Kevin Porter Jr literally hasn't done anything in the NBA and forced his way out of Cleveland. Dragic has the juice to say he doesn't want to stay in on the raptors and you're just going to have to deal with it as a fan
Cavs still should‚Äôve kept Kevin Porter Jr
"It all depends on wtf Fertitta plans to do with the Rockets.  I could totally just see him saying fuck it, and feeding the ball to Jalen Green while sitting Wall/Gordon, and basically turning it into a 3 man team with Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and an island of misfit toys around them.   Meanwhile the Pistons have a pretty promising young core/starting lineup, and guys like Jerami Grant that'll take up a lot of scoring and shots.     IMO Cade will have the better year from an eye-test standpoint, but Jalen Green will have the stats advantage."
Wow jalen green and Kevin Porter how cool. Fuck I‚Äôd gladly trade all the Nuggets if it meant I could get a rookie and a worse Porter jr.   ‚Äújokic will want out soon leaving you in poverty‚Äù  I mean do I even have to say it? Talking about this as a rockets fan?  And talking about jamals contract when you have the worst contract in the league on your roster

Kevin Porter Jr: Is Kevin Porter Jr gonna have to choke a bitch?
All depends on whether or not Kevin Porter Jr is gonna be the next Stephon Marbury/Latrell Sprewell
"My top five  1. Gary Trent Jr   2. Kevin Porter Jr.  3. Lonzo Ball  4. Kelson Johnson  5. Kyle Kuzma  I feel like most of the people mentioned are   - Stars (Zion, Shai, Sabonis, Ja), and would need a 1st team All-NBA or an MVP to win  - Second Year (LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton), and would all need to be legitimate stars to win it since there is a bias   - Guys that will probably be mostly as good if not a little better (FVV, Ben, Fox)"
I‚Äôve been here trying to figure out when they got Kevin or Michael Porter Jr and completely forgot about Otto
"""The Rockets will spend $36M total on contracts of Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, JaeSean Tate, Kevin Martin Jr, Daniel Theis and David Nwaba. The Lakers are gonna pay Russell Westbrook $44.2M per yr."""
"James Harden, local gentleman‚Äôs establishment benefactor, returns to Houston to face off against firearms handler extraordinaire, Kevin Porter Jr"
"Kevin Porter Jr is our developing PG. He's in the same mould as Harden. And Wall is a shot taking PG, not a CP3 type guy. Fuck him off."
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
Kevin Porter Jr. better than both
I really thought we had Kevin Porter Jr for a minute then I realise what thread I was on lmao
The five oldest players in the NBA in Vince Carter's last season:  * Rick Mahorn * Herb Williams * Eddie Johnson * Danny Schayes * Dominique Wilkins  The five youngest players in the NBA in Vince Carter's final season (min. 20 games)  * Zion Williamson * Coby WHite * Kevin Porter Jr * Nassir Little * Jaxson Hayes
Let me introduce you to Kevin Porter Jr. I've been assured by a random rocket's fan that's a max player soon.
Kevin Porter Jr

"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."

We traded four second rounders for Kevin Porter Jr so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre worthless whatsoever
Kevin Porter Jr. He's closer to James Harden than people realize.
&gt;Kevin Porter Jr will most likely take a jump to be a 24-25PPG scorer.  I guess if he is allowed to put up 20 shots a game lol
"&gt;Kevin Porter Jr will most likely take a jump to be a 24-25PPG scorer.  This is absolutely not ""most likely."""
Him and Kevin Porter Jr. are going to be a dynamic backcourt.
Yes exactly Kevin Porter Jr is our point guard of the future. My hope is that Porter jr and Green is our starting backcourt with JWall off the bench as 6th man. think he‚Äôd be much better in that role where he doesn‚Äôt have to play 30+ minutes ago but instead can function in sort of that Derrick rose role he played for the knicks last year.

"Star - Russell Westbrook - He's in a spot where he can do what he does best, but, without needing to be the first or second scoring option. Lebron tends not to miss when it comes to picking stars as teammates, and, Westbrook has a spirit that won't quit.  Emerging Star - Kevin Porter Jr. - he's got the keys as full time, starting PG for to the Rockets, and is equipped with young talent in Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, along with more seasoned players in Christian Wood and Daniel Theis. He put up a monstrous performance against the reigning champs (resulting in a rare victory  for the Rockets last season), to go along with some moments of promising play before the season's end  Unproven Star - Scottie Barnes - there were many skeptics who voiced their disapproval of the Raptors choosing Scottie Barnes so high, but, he showed out in the Summer League. I think Scottie Barnes may very well end up making an impactful statement for why the Raptors choose him, especially within an organization that has a strong reputation for developing young players"

"You missed out on a 5th starter/elite bench player in Cam Johnson. There's a reason Cam got picked 11th in the actual draft too because sometimes you just need a guy that you know is going to bring good value to your team.

No such thing as Europe as it pertains to basketball. The best G league players are bench warmers in the Swedish league? Here are some of the players playing in the g league last year: Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green   jordan Poole.  Paul Reed.  Jared Harper.  Henry Ellenson.  Jeremy Lin.  Nico Manion.  Oshae Brissett.  Kobi Simmons.  KJ Martin.  Jalen Adams.  Vernon Carey jr Antonio Blakeney.   Any of these players can play for top European clubs. Some would dominate. Some actually signed with European clubs and many more were called up to the NBA. Some were sent for development and played a good 10-15 games.
"&gt;Kevin Porter Jr is 21. Entering his 3rd year in the league, he is one of the pre-season favorites to win MIP.  MIP shouldn't have pre-season favourites the whole point is the player got better."
"It hasn‚Äôt fixed that situation, I‚Äôm pretty sure. Kevin Porter Jr. was a first round pick and he will make $2.1M this upcoming season. If he had been a second round pick and signed a two year deal he could‚Äôve made $9.5M (the 21-22 NTMLE)."

"&gt; LeVert's indiana stats are more important because he came off the bench in Brooklyn playing 27 minutes, in contrast to Barrett playing 34 minutes as a starter  Ok I get that for box score stats but not sure why the minutes matter for his ts% which would be lower than RJ‚Äôs if you included the whole season.  &gt; I think you are massively undervaluing 3.1 ppg and 1.9 apg - 3.1 ppg is the difference between Paul George and Malik Beasley, 1.9 apg is the difference between Jokic and Kevin Porter Jr.  Sure but 3.1 ppg is also the difference between Tatum/Mitchell and PG. Judging by the comments in the Tatum vs PG thread, I think people would downplay how much significance that gap is in that context. 1.2 more rpg is also notably more.  &gt; I'm not sure why it's being assumed that defensive advanced stats are the prime indicator of effectiveness.   That wasn‚Äôt my point. You said in your initial comment ‚ÄúYou can point out defense, eye test etc. but all advanced stats and tape strongly backs up that the stats tell an accurate story here.‚Äù  I was showing that ‚Äúall‚Äù the advanced stats don‚Äôt strongly back up those stats. LeVert may have averaged more steals for example, but advanced defensive stats don‚Äôt back up the claim that he‚Äôs a better defender based on that fact. I‚Äôm aware there are other stats that have LeVert over RJ but you referred to ‚Äúall‚Äù advanced stats, and I was pointing to the ones that don‚Äôt support your claim."

I think you are massively undervaluing 3.1 ppg and 1.9 apg - 3.1 ppg is the difference between Paul George and Malik Beasley, 1.9 apg is the difference between Jokic and Kevin Porter Jr.  But putting box score aside, I'm not sure why it's being assumed that defensive advanced stats are the prime indicator of effectiveness. Why not mention that LeVert's overall EPM is four times greater than Barrett's or that his LEBRON is almost double Barrett's, or that his RPM is roughly 87% higher? Yes, Barrett has strengths over LeVert, but you are selectively applying certain advanced stats while downplaying others to make your point."

Settle down bud. He‚Äôs just one of like 7 reasons I mentioned. But I guess because he plays angry all the time which ramps the intensity. He‚Äôs also a former MVP and hall of famer.   People care more about him than playing against Kevin Porter Jr.

"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."
"Weird take though, since both Garland and Sexton are seen as the better players. Garland will be aiming to average something like 17-8 this year and Sexton will drop 20+ ppg easily while also playing less iso ball this season. Okoro is pretty limited in what he can and can‚Äôt do. Plus he‚Äôs a bit too small to guard Small Forwards.   Cedi is fine for a role player and Mobley was awesome in his first game. We also got Windler, who‚Äôs a promising shooter, but he keeps getting injured.  Don‚Äôt forget we also had Kevin Porter Jr for a year and he played well too.   Overall, I would say there are definitely worse teams than us when it comes to drafting since we began our rebuild 3 years ago."
Kevin Porter Jr? Lol.

Kevin Porter Jr makes it to the All Star
"The the Magic hands down.  Isaac is a right wing nut who is made of glass.  Cole Anthony is a great dude but doesn't have the size to be an impact player.  Suggs hasn't played a game but I'm not convinced.   Honestly if we are talking young players to be excited about, I still think RJ Hampton has the most upside of anyone on our squad. Which....is sad.  The rockets blew up their team like 8 minutes ago and they have Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, and Alperen Sengun-- all who have all star ceilings.   I'm so jealous."
Kevin Porter Jr has been on some bad teams
Trade him to a texan team. Kevin porter Jr and Christian wood would be nice additions
Kevin Porter Jr is actually one of the young players I'm most looking forward to watching. So if he was in that trade I'd be over the moon.
"Hard to know, generally the G-League's best players are either borderline NBA players, NBA rookies that need to stay fresh because they aren't playing or NBA players coming off injuries that need some time to get back to 100%, LiAngelo isn't any of these.  Kevin Porter Jr. and Jordan Poole lit the G-League up last year when they played, LiAngelo isn't even in the same planet as these two as a player. The only thing Gelo does even remotely well is shoot and the dude shot 34% from 3 in the Summer League, that's not the profile of a player that gets called up from the G-League. NBA teams are looking for snipers that play hard to call from the G-League, not a inefficient scorer."

Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."

"Biased but I love watching Kevin Porter Jr atm, excited to see how his season turns out!"
"He's still linked to alot of their players and seems to [have a pretty keen interest in the young guys.](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/03/12/kevin-porter-jr-has-big-brother-in-former-rockets-star-james-harden/)  [He's still very active in Houston on a community level.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2932890-nets-james-harden-discusses-providing-food-water-for-houston-amid-texas-storms)  [He still makes a lot of Houston references.](https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1431284554766028803?lang=en)   And I think he's mentioned at one point wanting to come back, although it isn't clear if that means playing or a 1-day retirement contract.   It could be that Brooklyn for him is what Miami was for LeBron, a short stint with a superteam to win some rings while his hometeam retools.  But even if he stays in Brooklyn for the rest of his career, I still get the sense he'll always be more of a Rocket than a Net."
I mean if I knew back then that the trade was  James Harden for:  3 FRP's  4 pick swaps  Kevin Porter Jr (Came from the Prince in cleveland debacle)  Jalen Green  Josh Christopher  2022 Miami pick swap  &amp;#x200B;  I would've been really really happy actually

Did they update it for Kevin Porter Jr?
That's fair. I do think Jalen will be the better of the two as well as well. However I think KPJ's all in with the Rockets.  [He says the Houston Rockets saved his life picking him up while he was down. Apparently he was losing interest playing Basketball in general with the Cavs and fell into depression but he loves playing with the Rockets and wants to stay there for a long time.](https://www.thedreamshake.com/2021/9/29/22699680/kevin-porter-jr-houston-rockets-life-has-been-the-subject-of-change-both-on-and-off-the-court)  &amp;#x200B;  I guess only time will tell how things play out with him.
"What's your re-draft to include all 3 of them in the top 7? I think there's a pretty clear top 5 in Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter and Garland, and then there's only two spots left for:  * Keldon Johnson  * Jordan Poole  * Kevin Porter Jr  * Rui Hachimura  * Tyler Herro  * PJ Washington  * Matisse Thybulle"
"Claxton at 31 still has massive potential too, in my opinion.  Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, KZ Okpala, Keldon Johnson, Nicolas Claxton is a seriously solid team of late, consecutive picks. KZ should be set to step up a bit in Miami this season."
"I think if the Simmons drama plays out into the regular season and the 76'ers don't have a trade,  Tyrese Maxey could have a breakout year as well.  My top 4 are Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole and  Tyrese Maxey"
"Tbf we did pass up on Kevin Porter Jr, but we don't know if he avoids his off-court issues in OKC"
"Looking back, they did well in the Harden trade. It allowed them to tank to get Jalen Green, and they got lucky with Kevin Porter Jr, and as they got expiring's it allowed them to be younger. They will be a very fun team"
"Kevin Porter Jr will average 20/4/9   I believe ok, dont bully me :("
"Here‚Äôs a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions‚Äô moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell‚Äôs deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn‚Äôt want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they‚Äôd just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You‚Äôd be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren‚Äôt gaining assets for it."
"I‚Äôm like Kevin Porter Jr?  Michael Porter Jr. oh no, Otto Porter Jr"
People see Kevin Porter Jr as a future star and franchise player but I think hes gonna be Caris Levert
"&gt; Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  I feel like a lot of these comments are made with so much confidence but when has this strategy worked?  We've seen plenty of instances where teams have put on this brave face and then bailed early because the trade value doesn't rise but it does sometimes drop even further.   We can look at Anthony Davis, James Harden and Jimmy Butler as examples where holding out didn't net a better return. We can also look at role players like Eric Bledsoe in Phoenix or Kevin Porter Jr in Cleveland.   Disgruntled players just don't sell for top dollar.   ***  In addition, the trade deadline is historically a buyer's market. It's a terrible time to sell an all-star because teams aren't in a position to refill their rosters after offering a big trade package.  [The history of trade deadline deals is incredibly weak.](https://ca.nba.com/news/revisiting-some-of-the-most-impactful-deals-at-the-nba-trade-deadline-since-the-year-2000/rk8sg9udnjt416rhzcbyald04) It's when you offload bad money or buy role players on expiring deals. It's not the time to be selling All-Stars.   The offseason is a seller's market, but the 76ers have decided to do their business in a buyer's market instead."
"I‚Äôm not even a Houston fan, lmao, just someone who looks at stuff from the outside objectively. What‚Äôs the point of OKC hoarding all those picks if he can‚Äôt even use it to draft an elite player.  Besides it‚Äôs not like OKC couldn‚Äôt have signed Christian Wood. Oh also Kevin Porter Jr. was handed to Houston for a second."
Kevin Porter Jr   Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson
Kevin Porter Jr. is the starting point guard for the 'better-than-you-expect' Houston Rockets.
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
Kevin Porter Jr
1. Julius Randle  2. Bradley Beal  3. Kevin Porter Jr
Think that was KEVIN Porter Jr
Anthony Edwards vs Kevin Porter Jr. 6'6 standoff in the conference finals this season
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
"""distant locker""  Dang, I hope Kevin Porter Jr is vaccinated..."
"[Another fun stat from Andy Bailey](https://twitter.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1442615190348918784)  &gt;Denver scored 120.2 PTS per 100 possessions when Michael Porter Jr. was on the floor in 2020-21.  &gt;Among those who appeared in 30+ gms &amp; played 20+ MIN/gm, Kevin Durant (121.7), Kawhi Leonard (121.4) &amp; Nikola Jokic (120.2) were the only players who matched or exceeded MPJ's ORtg."
"But you‚Äôre saying Green does, who despite his athleticism is also slow-footed laterally &amp; cannot keep up with iso‚Äôs and players turning the corner?  If Kevin Porter Jr has the tools to be a good defender than so does MPJ. You can nitpick all you want cause ppl can nitpick them right back  Murray is a good defender, Jokic is solid in the post, and MPJ has the ‚Äútools‚Äù lol"
Kevin Porter Jr will be the best player from the 2019 draft class
"I‚Äôm optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
Kevin Porter Jr baby

Kevin Porter Jr running away from the basketball as his teammates yell at him to go get it seems a little different
"Even if this were true, out of shape John Wall would still be better than 37% FG Kevin Porter Jr"
He was looking like vintage Kevin Porter Jr. out there
Wow all this time I thought MPJ and Kevin Porter JR were siblings
Wall is a great player and better than a lot of starting point guards right now. The problem is a lot of people who don't watch him play are really low on Kevin Porter Jr.   Point guard is a difficult position. KPJ is only 21. At his highs this season he is an above average starting point guard. Wall would probably be about average.
I believe the young guys would really benefit from him playing actually.   Nobody is getting better from the Kevin Porter Jr at point guard experience.
"Avery Bradley was #1 above John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins in high school. Looked almost never gonna make the league at Texas. But he still out here, making NBA paychecks.   Kevin Porter Jr for the Rockets comes to mind as well.   There's a lot of these actually"
Then let the kid foul out. The team is so bad right now it's not like it could get worse. Also absolute turkeys in defense like Kevin porter Jr and Jalen green are still getting minutes. It doesn't make sense that Sengun is the only young player who needs to earn his minutes while those other 2 are getting them while dogging it out there.

WB fans like to take anecdotal positives as consistent trends..  They are the oddest bunch to me.

"Trae Young's impact would not go down due to the new officiating roles.  Brandon Ingram won't be a winning player without Zion.   Evan Mobley will be the best looking rookie (defense gives him the edge over Barnes)  Golden State will look like a championship team.

"kevin porter jr. is only scintillating because he greases himself up before every game, thats why he turns the ball over so much"
"This sub loves praising the Warriors, but why is no one talking about the defending Western Conference Champion Suns being on a 10 game win streak?  I didn't realize until now that the Suns are currently on a 10 game win streak.. why is no-one talking about this?  They beat a strong Mavs team yesterday and nearly won by 30 pts against the Rockets with a scintillating Kevin Porter Jr. And they still have Dario Saric to come back from injury.  For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what's the main reason for the complete domination? You would think they'd have a bunch of struggles to start the season after their agonizing Finals loss.."
"Yea man you don‚Äôt actually like, know my team. Let me help you out.  Jae‚ÄôSean Tate is a bonafide hustler. Any team would love to have him. He never stops. He‚Äôs like Patrick Beverley with more overall talent and capabilities. He is far from trash so your statement alone is not only unwarranted, it‚Äôs amateur.  What you have is a group of guys with little chemistry, and inexperience. Kevin Porter JR is playing PG, which is new to him. He‚Äôs learning to keep his dribble going. He‚Äôs used to catching a pass, making a move, and either scoring or dishing out. But now he‚Äôs in control of the offense. That‚Äôs a huge brain switch for any player at any level. He scored 50 pts in a game when Wall was still playing. He‚Äôs very capable, just needs time. And he shoots under 12 shots a game‚Ä¶not a chucker in the slightest.  Jalen Green is the rook. But man his ceiling is HIGH. I‚Äôm not trying to compare him to the other rookies. He‚Äôs Jalen. He‚Äôs gonna be a pure star in this league.   Imo - sengun has the higher upside and more IQ than Wood. Wood is a very good complimentary player. He‚Äôs not a KAT like coach thinks he is."

"Kevin Porter Jr just consistently makes losing plays, dude makes Nick Young look like a winner"
Not sure I've actually seen Kevin Porter Jr play. Seen a couple highlights and that's it.
Kevin Porter Jr.
"I remember Harden doing it in a triple double, so at least one other. I‚Äôm sure Westbrook and Lebron have done it too.  Edit: https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-games-with-50-points-and-10-assists-in-nba-history-by-players  Harden has the most with 8, Lillard and Westbrook have 3, lebron has 2, a couple people have 1. It‚Äôs a short list, only 10 people. Kevin Porter Jr is on there somehow."
Jalen green and Kevin porter jr all I‚Äôm saying   + Tate and sengun Lowkey
Kevin Porter Jr   David Nwaba when he does anything outside of transition
Rockets want the ball in the hands of Kevin Porter Jr and Jalen Green. Trying to get them all the play making reps they can to develop them.   I don't think it's his decision. Team doesn't want him to play bc they want to develop young guys and lose games.
Usman Garuba's name is Destiny Usman Garuba.  Kevin Porter Jr.'s name is Bryan Kevin Porter Jr.

"So uhhh, is Kevin Porter jr. ok and why is he getting clutch minutes over Jalen Green??  I enjoyed watching this Rockets team a lot, especially Alperen, but KPJ is a problem and not in a good way lol"
Kevin Porter Jr.
Didnt James Harden sit out last season? And he also came back and played half-heartedly and DGAF.   Didnt Kevin Porter Jr. cause the Cavs to trade him?  This behavior isnt new to the NBA.  Simmons is just another butthurt star that wants to be traded. This is commonplace lol.

"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson.

"No. There's these things called weight rooms, and Kevin Porter Jr. will have to visit it more often in order to stop Lebron with a head of steam."
"Kevin Porter Jr was saying he was 6-6 because he's taller than Jalen Green 6-9 with the hair  In reality, Green is 6-3, he's 6-4"
Kevin Porter Jr has 30 assists to 32 turnovers
"I think they messed up is by  having so many high level guards and then letting them walk out for free while Tatum and brown were on their rookie contracts.   They're in no man's land. Your cap is maxed and your players are great but they aren't named durant, or giannas. Should just trade brown for everything the rockets have. Take John wall, Kenyon Martin Jr and Kevin porter u just got a 1 2 and 4 postion for jaylen brown."
Damn they shut down a Kevin Porter Jr led offense   Amazing accomplishment
Remember there was some dude here who was arguing with me about how it's possible for Kevin Porter Jr to average 10 asts a game lol
Lebron just standing there as Kevin Porter Jr runs right by him
"Of all the players not named Kevin Porter Jr., they have few TOs per game than players named Kevin Porter Jr."
"Ok, but among players who are named Kevin Porter Jr., who is averaging the most turnovers?"
I need more not named Kevin Porter Jr. stats
"&gt;Westbrook is averaging more turnovers (6.0) than everyone in the league not named Kevin Porter Jr. (6.3).   just say he is second worst, man. what is this phrasing lmao"
"P a i n. I have dame, fox and Kevin Porter Jr. on my fantasy team"
damn those are Kevin Porter Jr numbers
Cade &gt; Bageley tho I could see the Cavs trading Kevin Porter Jr for Bageley

"Grayson Allen, Kevin porter Jr, and Tyler Johnson"
Can we call Kevin Porter Jr KPJ?
"Kevin porter has a kid with Woman and names his kid Kevin porter jr.    Then they divorce and woman has a kid with Michael porter, and name their kid Michael porter jr.  MPJ and KPJ would be half brothers with different dads but the same mom and both be juniors  unless you're asking something else"
"I don‚Äôt know, but that Denver ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù isn‚Äôt winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokiƒá is a very overrated player. I‚Äôd rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, or Joel Embiid than Nikola Jokiƒá. It‚Äôs close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."
Kevin Porter Jr&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kevin Knox
Exactly lol. Dudes like Kevin Porter Jr just run through the g-league and are taken out right away. If you're just too above the comp they will not keep you there. Teams are always in need of nba level players
Weird having every Rockets starter finish with a positive +/- except for Kevin Porter Jr.
"Teams can technically get around this by trading a player they own the rights to in a trade, usually a European player that has no intention of coming to the NBA. See this: https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Tadija-Dragicevic/Summary/821   Another popular one is trading for a top 55 protected pick. The likelihood of that pick conveying is super low. See this: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30756372/source-cleveland-cavaliers-trading-kevin-porter-jr-houston-rockets-second-round-pick"
Cash or draft picks can go the other way. The closest thing to nothing would be Houston taking Kevin Porter Jr for a top 55 protected 2nd rounder that just goes away unless they make the playoffs this season
i‚Äòm a timberwolves fan so i dont know if there is anyone worth praising lol but shoutout to kevin porter jr for seemingly getting the curve &amp; becoming one of the more exciting young players this season
Kevin Porter Jr. Kinda high too...
That's Kevin Porter Jr lol
