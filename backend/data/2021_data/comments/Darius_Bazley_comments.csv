"They attempt to and don’t always do so successfully.   I’m a Thunder fan and I have missed probably less than 20 games in the last 5 years.   I know for example that Darius Bazley (who was ranked top 30 in overall RAPTOR last year) is a better defender then Alejsej Pokusevski, who literally should be in the G-league if we weren’t tanking.   Bazley is now ranked 208th in RAPTOR. Poku is ranked 63rd.   Jeff Teague was one of the worst defenders last year while being on two of the worst defensive teams in the league. He’s now ranked 17th while being on the Celtics who are top 10 in defense."
"+/- is not a good stat for measuring individual performance.  That said, here are the minus leaders:  1. D'Angelo Russell    /  -165 2. Cory Joseph         /  -117 3. Glenn Robinson III  /  -113 4. Darius Bazley       /  -111 5. Ricky Rubio         /  -102"
Y'all better start rooting HARD for Darius Bazley

Honestly they'd probably have a chance in the East; the Bulls have been missing a true lead guard and SGA would do wonders there. Thunder also flush out the depth chart.   PG: SGA / Satoransky / George Hill   SG: LaVine / Coby White / Dort   SF: Otto Porter Jr / Patrick Williams / Justin Jackson  PF: Lauri Markannen / Thad Young / Darius Bazley   C: Al Horford / WCJ / Muscala
"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that’s not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I’m perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can’t let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It’s early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that’s completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala’s three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don’t want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that’s just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn’t really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"

Smh how much help does Darius Bazley need
"Theo Maledon, Dwayne Bacon, Isaac Okoro, Darius Bazley, Aron Baynes"
"Maybe Darius Bazley or Danuel House. Haven't looked at every team so I'm not certain, but DJJ is definitely not the worst."
For pf Derrick Jones isn’t that good but not the worst.  Just one guy but Darius bazley has not been good for okc.
"Tanking aside, one could easily argue it's legitimately better for the team to dedicate all the PF/C minutes they can to their many young guys who actually need the PT to develop. And by god, they have so many of them:  1. Developing Poku should be their #1 priority in the frontcourt. Very exciting player. 2. Isiah Robi looks promising   4. Darius Bazley is quickly turning into a potentially great stretch big who can get you 15/10 every night  3. Moses Brown is young and needs minutes 4. They also recently acquired Tony Bradley from Philly, and he's been averaging like 20 MPG over the past 4 games, minutes he needs and certainly wouldn't get with Horford back in the rotation.  Horford is not really much of an asset for the squad, he was traded to OKC as a salary dump for Danny Green. At best, you'd call him ""salary _filler_ for Danny Green"", but even then you'd be disingenuous. The main assets OKC got were Theo Maledon and the future first.  I would argue sitting old man Horford isn't about tanking necessarily, because if OKC didn't even have their pick, they still wouldn't play him much (if at all). Whose young guy from that list would you take away minutes from?"
Thunder:  SGA  Hordford  Dort  Kenny Hustle  Mike Muscala  Darius Bazley  Moses Brown  Isaiah Roby  Theo Meldeon   Why TF can't we tank. Lol.
"Sabonis, Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, Darius Bazley, Lu Dort too but I guess that doesn't really fit the narrative."
"He is also credited for the spurs picking Tony Parker, selected Ibaka/Reggie Jackson/Steven Adams all with mid/late first round picks and in more recent times he drafted Sabonis, Darius Bazley(solid contributor for the last few years) and he scouted Dort and got him to sign a super cheap contract."
We need less posts about Andre Drummond and more posts about Darius Bazley.

"Darius Bazley, I think"
"Lu Dort’s improvement is honestly crazy this year. While his shot has ways to go to become consistent, it is actually a threat compared to last year. The fact that he was shooting such a high % earlier in the season was mind blowing.   Darius Bazley, on the other hand, has been super inconsistent and I feel like having that veteran presence last year with CP3 helped him a lot. I think he plays better without SGA on the court and where he’s handling the ball and he has been playing fairly well recently, but he has a ton of work to do.   I honestly thought Bazley was going to make a jump and Lu Dort would stay relatively the same, but that completely flipped."

"Its unfair to expect a depleted Celtics to beat a superteam consisting of Ty Jerome, Darius Bazley, and Lu Dort"
"In the salary cap era you really just can't expect to beat a team able to convince Ty Jerome, Darius Bazley, and Luguentz Dort to join one big superteam, and STILL have salary left over for Isaiah Roby. That's just unfair."
Darius Bazley is like that

What a beast. Dude locked up Isaiah Roby and Darius Bazley 🔥
Moses Brown and Darius Bazley are already looking like they’ll be rotational guys at worst too
"I also enjoy the reverse of this, Darius Bazley is a good example for the thunder.  Watching the broadcasts you'd think he's had a great sophomore season and is a good up and coming star but most people on the thunder sub think he should be traded and given up on."
1. Stanley Johnson  2. Theo Maledon  3. Bismack Biyombo  4. Darius Bazley  5. Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk  6. Aleksej Pokusevski  7. Dwayne Bacon  8. Cole Anthony  9. LeBron James  10. Isaac Okoro
Eh I would argue Darius Bazley would have been more impactful for the Grizzlies rn than Brandon Clarke since Clarke is out of the rotation currently.
"No he would not. He has no handle or shot creation ability (thinking about it now, he has no offensive ability at all) and if he can’t make open looks next to ben Simmons and Embiid he sure as hell won’t never to Darius fucking Bazley and Moses Brown."
"Aleksej Pokuševski was selected with the 17th overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the youngest player selected in the draft. Two days after the draft in November 2020, his draft rights were traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team trade. On 9 December 2020, Pokuševski signed with the Thunder. On 3 February 2021, Pokuševski received his first assignment at Oklahoma City Blue, the affiliate team of Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA G League. In his rookie season, he is the youngest active player in the NBA. On 14 March, Pokuševski made his first NBA career start. He scored 23 points which includes five 3-pointers, grabbed a career-high 10 rebounds and dished out 4 assists in a 128–122 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, becoming the third Thunder rookie (following Russell Westbrook and Darius Bazley) to post a 20–10 double-double. At 19 years and 78 days old, he became the youngest player in franchise history to score 20+ points while also setting the record for being the youngest player in league history with 20+ points, 10+ rebounds and 5+ 3-pointers made in a game. Pokuševski also became the second-youngest player in NBA history to make five 3-pointers in a game behind only LeBron James in 2004."
"Who are you talking about as 5, Kuminga? You think Scottie Barnes is that far below Kuminga? 5&amp;6 are just not further apart then 6&amp;16, that’s insane. And if you think we would even trade SGA for Cade straight up, you haven’t watched enough SGA lately.   Talk about screwing Cleveland, in the scenario I proposed OKC is giving up pick 6, 16, 4 future firsts, Theo Maledon , AND Darius Bazley for literally just the #1."
"A couple of guys they missed out on:  Matisse Thybulle  Brandon Clarke  Darius Bazley  Terrance Mann  Talen Horton-Tucker  Obviously everything is in hindsight, but it's a bit interesting going back and seeing what players teams missed out on later in the draft."
"Jalen Green, Kuminga, Emoni bates decommitted to potentially go pro, LaMelo, Daishen Nix, RJ Hampton, Anfernee Simons, Darius Bazley"
"Jamal and Dejounte Murray!  Then like Darius Bazley, Terrance Davis, Taurean Prince, and WCS. Qickley, Maxey, and Patrick Williams as rookies.  So... you can go real young + Kawhi, or very Murray + Kawhi."
I don't care how much chemistry Lu Dort and Darius Bazley have they're not winning a gold.
"Darius Bazley and 6? Bazley's defence, inside scoring and passing could fit into your core pretty nicely. I rate Baze pretty highly but Poku's growth has put Baze on the table"
"Out of curiosity I ranked players by PPG to see how many have a negative AST/TO. The only players with negative ratios in the top 100 are:    Embiid - 2.8/3.1   MPJ - 1.1/1.3   John Collins - 1.2/1.3   Clint Capela - 0.8/1.2   DeAndre Ayton - 1.4/1.5   Rudy Gobert - 1.3/1.7   Darius Bazley - 1.8/2.2   Lauri Markannen - 0.9/1.0   Brook Lopez - 0.7/0.9    That’s the list. 91 other players are able to shoulder a scoring burden without having a negative ratio, regardless of their position or role in the offense.   The thing all these guys have in common? No handles. I think if Embiid wants to take another step towards being the most dominant player in the league has has to work on his handles and reading the defense when he’s double-teamed in the post."
So…  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don’t grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don’t think they will?
"Look at everyone picked around him tho. Darius Bazley, Nassir Little, Luka Samanic, Goga bitadze, Dylan Windler.  They all sound like fake names lol."
"The Thunder were similarly talented to this Atlanta team if you believe CP3 is the caliber of player you say he is.   CP3, Shai, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lu Dort, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazley, Mike Muscala, etc.   vs  Trae, Bogi, Capela, Huerter, Collins, Gallo, Lou Williams, Tony Snell, Okongwu, etc.  Left off Hunter and Reddish since both of them missed almost the entirety of this season and are out currently."
"&gt; Traded Grayson Allen, Darius Bazley, Jae Crowder, Kyle Korver and a 2020 1st round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Mike Conley. (1-7 and 15-30 protected)  So a 2018 first round pick, a 2019 first round pick, an elite role player, and an aging vet, and a protected 1st.  Not exactly sure how Thybulle, Maxey, salary filler, and a 1st is far off from Conleys trade value."
"Sadiq Bey, Rui, Darius Bazley, Keldon Johnson or either one of Ayton/Mikal. I'll thrown Cam J in there as well."
Darius Bazley
These are his last 15 picks before this draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis Semaj Christon
"I don't know about this guy that much, but tbh for five star prospects, there is a decent chance of being drafted regardless of how well they play. Especially guys who have a lot of physical potential. Like Darius Bazley was a top 20 recruit, planned to play in the G-League instead of college, cancelled that plan and just trained on his own, and was an intern at New Balance for 3 months (apparently making $1 million (!)). Without even playing his draft year, he got drafted 23 in 2019. Mudiay was a top 5 recruit, played in China, and went 7th in 2015. IDK if I would recommend doing it, especially if you are not a five star recruit, but there is precedent for highly ranked recruits getting picked regardless of their play or level of competition"
We will see the difference between College and G-league this next season. None of us really know if it benefits players to go to the G-League instead of college. I think the only player that has done it so far that has played an NBA game is Darius Bazley and he was a top 15 player in his class and hasn’t panned out in the nba so far.
He’s certainly worse than Schroeder. Russ shot an absolutely abysmal 29% of catch shoot 3s the last 2 seasons playing next to Harden and Beal.   Dennis is slight below average Russ is the worst high volume shooter in the league. For context Darius Bazley was the only player in the NBA that shot under 30% from 3 on more than 4 attempts a games. Russ has pulled that off 5 of the last 7 seasons.
"They’re not my team but I think they’ll end up in it,  1. OKC  2. Kemba Walker, Darius Bazley, 2021 Boston 1st Rd, 2022 Phoenix 1st Rd &amp; 2023 Denver 1st Rd   3. Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton   4. IDK   5. Simmons is young enough to be a part of the Thunder rebuild and should mesh well with SGA. Milton is solid enough to start for OKC too.   Walker is still a solid PG and I think in the end this id the best they can get for Simmons, Bazley gives them a role player with some upside and the picks give them more ammunition to make other deals to help the team"
"It’s not quite 3 or 4 years. Russ is the worst high volume 3 point shooter in the league. For context, the only player who shot more than 4 a game and made sub 30% this season was Darius Bazley a developmental guy. Russ has pulled that off 5 of the last 7 seasons."
"4 or 5 a game for someone who shoots as poorly as Russ is extremely high volume. Other than developmental players like Darius Bazley you don't see anyone shooting that volume consistently shooting sub 30%. For context, Bazley was the only player in the NBA this season that shot sub 30% and took more than 4 attempts a game. Russ has pulled that feat 5 of the last 7 seasons. Acatully this was Russ's best 3 point shooting season in 4 years.   Schroder really tailed off as the season went on, but he is just a slightly below league average shooter the last 3 seasons. 34% from 3 on nearly 1000 attempts."
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
Darius Bazley gets MIP
Raul Neto/Darius Bazley/Dwayne Bacon/Giannis/Shaq
Kleber is a better shooter and probably a better defender than McDaniels. Either way the answer to this question is easily Darius Bazley.
PG: Killian Hayes   SG: whoever the Lakers start at SG this year   SF: Gary Harris  PF: Darius Bazley  C: Khrm Birch
He’s saying that you are Darius Bazley trying to post about himself. 😊
"My teams: Suns, Nets , Kings, Wizards, 76ers, Warriors and Thunder   PG: Ben Simmons (3rd)  SG: Devin Booker (2nd)  SF: Kevin Durant (1st)  PF: Draymond Geeen (4th)  C: Montrezl Harrell (7th)  6th man: Harrison Barnes (6th)  Bench: Darius Bazley (5th)"
Meh  We knew Bennett sucked year one  JaMarcus was so-so in year 2 and we knew he sucked year 3  A better comparison is probably Darius Bazley
"Either Mike Muscala, Ty Jerome, or Darius Bazley"

"Darius Bazley is the definition of dark horse stardom player, he’s bout to take a gargantuan 3rd year jump I promise 🤞🏾"
"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he’s a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he’d be an awful fit. Though I’m not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he’s a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ’ for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he’s a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon’s a different story in my opinion. And I’m not even all that high on him but I think he’d work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there’s a fair few other guys I’d say the same about even if they’re not as good players in a vacuum."
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
Darius Bazley just built different #1of1
Bro is 30 something years old beefing with Darius Bazley who is young and doesn't care/know if you're supposed to hold the ball for time to run out. He should been wise instead of an ass
Darius “Gotem” Bazley
Yeah thats definitely what I said. They are the youngest team in the league and Darius Bazley doing that sure showed it. Not a big deal but it's an unwritten rule that's about mutual respect
"Need the Darius Bazley biopic tomorrow, Hollywood."
Counter-tanking to force OKC to shed talent? Lol. Darius Bazley is the only Klutch player on OKC.
None of them are shooting well and it's happening at the same time. They are young and inconsistent and relying on guys like Darius Bazley too much imo.
"Luka alone probably has more equity than the entirety of a team like the Magic or Thunder's ""young core"". Do you think any front office would trade Luka for all of SGA, Poku, Dort, Tre Mann, Josh Giddey, and Darius Bazley combined?"

"He's a talented defender but he's a 20mpg player and he's 24 years old. Its a fine pick.   Look at the picks after...   Brandon Clarke 24mpg   Grant Williams 18mpg   Darius Bazley 31 mpg   Then a bit lower...   Jordan Poole 20 mpg    Keldon Johnson 29 mpg   Kevin Porter Jr 32 mpg   Nic Claxton 17 mpg   Its a fine pick. Definitely not bad, but not the best value pick in that draft range."
Darius Bazley if he wants a future on that team.

"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
"Thunder fans all have their eyes on Darius Bazley.  He's still only 21, but he's going into his third year having averaged 14/7/2 last season in 31MPG shooting 40/29/70 splits.  Presti still seems high on him, but this is a pivotal year to see if he's got a real place in this league. If he has a good season, then that probably sets him up for a rookie extension and more years to play in the league. But if he doesn't put it together this year, it seems doubtful that Presti would extend him, and anything can happen with young players who don't get their rookie extension. Maybe they sign with another team and their career takes off from there, or maybe they get stuck on a cycle of one-year-contracts for losing teams where things never come together for them."
what about Chuma Okeke and Darius Bazley on the SAME TEAM
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"
Yeah but if you go into the season based entirely on bubble rankings then TJ Warren would be an all-NBA lock and Darius Bazley would be a top 75 player in the entire league.
They need defensive savant Darius Bazley.
"Darius Bazley   He gets a lot of hate  He sometimes is a ball stopper just a complete record scratch in the offense, is super inconsistent but has high highs and really low lows.  He's also pretty bipolar in media sessions, sometimes he's super nice and sometimes he's Russel westbrook to the media.  If he didn't try to be the man as much I think the fan base wouldn't laser focus on him so much but he sometimes plays like he's a star and right now he wouldn't be a role player for most teams in the league."
You’ve gotta be crazy if you think either of those two are the worst.   Cory Joseph Darius Bazley Avery Bradley
Darius Bazley no doubt
Darius bazley
Darius Bazley is not good
Darius Bazley
"The write up on OKC is weirdly just kinda shitting on Bazley and Poku lol   “Forward Darius Bazley has started every game this season, but the 21-year-old former first-round pick isn't making much of a case that he should be considered part of the Thunder's long-term core. Bazley is shooting only 37.1% from the floor and 28.1% from 3-point range, slight dips from last season's poor percentages. But 19-year-old former first-rounder Aleksej Pokusevski (34.9% from the floor, 20.5% on 3s) isn't exactly pushing for more playing time”"
two weeks ago he tried to fight darius bazley for doing something he does all the time
"I don't understand why they don't just start him, give him real minutes, and see what happens. It's not like OKC is competing for a championship. They need to develop their players, and it's not like Darius Bazley is going to turn into a star any time soon.  At least Poku looks like he has the potential to be more than he is right now."

"Steals, multiple? He gave one steal, and blocks. One steal ain't shit compared to the tradeoffs tonight. Blocks were nice, but turnovers add up, missed FT/FG% add up, and was outscored by the rest of my team outside of someone I streamed.  Fuckin Darius Bazley, someone I picked up to stream last week and am dropping had a better game since AST is usually guaranteed for me so Ants are negligible and Im punting REB so those 12 ain't helping."

"Darius Bazley, dude has so much athleticism and is surprisingly skilled for his size... But holy fuck he has the lowest basketball IQ I've ever seen I've never seen him go into a play with any sort of plan. He's got a quick trigger finger on 3s even though he's only half decent at them and his drives are even uglier to watch with him spinning and flailing up a missed layup that never had a chance.

Darius Bazley. Best tank commander one could ask for
"Unrelated to Westbrook, tuning into yesterday's game made me realized how much I hate watching Darius Bazley everytime he's on the floor. It looks like he tries on D but makes the wrong read often and on offense he just has blinders up as he forces up an ugly ass shot."
"Darius Bazley. I mean, he is young, which could be used as an execuse, but it's his 3rd year already and he still didn't improve a single bit in his shot selection, passing or court vision. Dude plays like a knucklehead most of the time. He is actual tank  commander."
i don't know how a team of wily vets lose to a team that plays darius bazley starter minutes TWICE  not to mention choke big leads in both games
It is tank commander Darius Bazley time
Darius Bazley tank commander just bricked 2 free throws.
Based on reading this comment section I’ve deduced that Killian Hayes is a Detroitian Darius Bazley. I’m so sorry for your loss y’all 😔
"It’s crazy how some rookies/young guys come in to the league and it’s obvious they have skill but have a long way to go to reach their potential.  Then you draft a big tall white kid from Australia and it’s totally obvious to everyone that not only does he belong the in the nba, but he is already contributing to a high level at 19.   We’ve had a ton of young guys come thru with high potential and it takes like 3 years, sometimes never, for them to get it.   Literally after Giddey’s first 2 games, the entire fanbase was like, “oh. Yeah. He’s obviously good.” And after 3 seasons or Darius Bazley, and one season of Poku, we still don’t know wtf to think of them"
The Thunder can offer you the amazing Darius Bazley. You don't even have to give us Coby! Just take him!
It's too bad that he'll miss on some all star selections because OKC is trying to tank despite the fact that he's clearly all star caliber and as good as some of the other young promising guards who just have the chance of not having Darius Bazley as their second best scorer
"You should thank Darius ""Tank Commander"" Bazley"
"He was fucking ridiculous in the fourth. The second NBA game I ever got to see live, and it was a pleasure to see a star-level player truly go unconscious. That fourth quarter was him walking down the court, calling for the ball, staring Darius Bazley in the eye, and coldly hitting shot after shot in his face. Wild.  Even provoked Bazley into that stupid as hell 1v2 possession with a minute left where he drove into PG and Reggie and lost the ball without ever trying to involve another Thunder player or actually run an offense. I really do think Bazley got mad at PG lighting him up and decided to try to be the hero and take PG on himself, because Bazley thinks he's an all-star."
"Yeah, people are making tank jokes, but we actually wanted to win tonight. You can tell by the way we played Muscala and Kenrich Williams a lot tonight with SGA/Giddey; even though their stats don't look great, they're the veteran leaders of the team and play the smartest basketball. They're the players we play when we want to win.  Unfortunately, Dort was out and Darius ""I'ma go 1v2 with PG and Reggie Jackson with one minute left on the clock"" Bazley was out there with those four instead.  This wasn't a tank loss. This was a ""young team falls apart in the fourth quarter and also why is Darius Bazley taking the ball away from SGA and Giddey"" loss."
"Darius Bazley is nowhere near their caliber of basketball (but he very very much wants to be, rather than playing a 3-and-D wing type of role) but he reminds me of the same archetype.  Every possession he takes for his own iso, he does a bunch of flashy dribble moves that never actually go anywhere, then he throws up a wild shot and hopes for a foul call.  Some Thunder fans saw Instagram footage of him doing the very same moves in open gyms and bought into the hype, and it's like, man. Going off of what you said, I wonder if there's a big behind-the-scenes conflict between private coaches/trainers and team development coaches. I can imagine team coaches asking players to spend their summers grinding away at their catch-and-shoot game, only to see private trainers having guys do dribble moves into pull-up isos."
"Darius Bazley is 21! OF COURSE he's inconsistent!!  I have a real issue with some of their recent trades. Quickley would be nice on this team. I think he makes more sense than Poku who is still 3 years away if you're lucky.   And they should have kept Sengun. He's 19 and already clearly belongs on an NBA floor. WTF are you trading him for? He's exactly the kind of guy they should be getting and keeping. That 2022 pick they got is top 16 protected, and the 2023 pick is not likely to be someone who can help you win while you're building around Shai.   Those two trades make me think that Presti is just playing three card monte."
"Trade idea:   Mavericks get:   * Christian Wood  Thunder get:   * John Wall  * 2027 Mavericks 1st (top 5 protected)  * 2023 Rockets 1st (lotto protected each year until unprotected 2027)  * 2022, 2024 Mavericks 2nds   Rockets get:   * Kristaps Porzingis  * Darius Bazley  * Gabriel Deck  * Derrick Favors  It works in the trade machine financially. Mavericks burn a pick to turn KP into Christian Wood. Rockets move Wood and a heavily protected pick to get rid of John Wall, and they get back a fair return. Thunder take on Wall's contract to get a few picks. Who says no?"
Thunder have so much cap space they could take KP on $32/y and send back a rookie contract like Darius Bazley ($2.5m)  Y'all could use that extra $30m
I think he's not worth his contract but he's still playable so they could get something for him.   The Thunder need a big man and are hella under the cap. I feel like they would take Porzingis and a lotto-protected 1st for like Darius Bazley or Derrick Favors. Mavs would do it purely to get $32m/y off the books for the next three years
