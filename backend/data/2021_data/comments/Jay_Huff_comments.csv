"At the start of the play, Zion is on Kyle Guy (UVA #5), Marques Bolden (Duke #20) is on Jay Huff (UVA #30), and RJ Barrett (Duke #5) on Hunter (UVA #12). Huff sets the pick to get Zion off Guy. Bolden then switches onto off Huff onto Guy, but Zion stays on Guy. In a typical pick and roll situation, the defender guarding the ball handler (Zion on Guy) and the defender guarding the screener (Bolden on Huff) switch after the screen is executed. Zion not switching onto Huff forces Barrett to switch onto Huff. That means he abandons Hunter, who's free to run to the three point line, leaving him open for the extra pass. The defensive recovery onto a guy who wasn't his man was great, but he only had to recover because of the initial error. OP asked why a player who was so good on defense in college and high school has struggled in the pros; it's because you can't pull off that kind of recovery in the NBA, so all that's left is the first error.   **Here's where, watching it again, I could have made a mistake**: I initially assumed Zion/Bolden were supposed to switch, but it could be that they were supposed to blitz Guy and the defensive strategy just failed. In that case, it's more of a blown play because of tactics, and not because of anything Zion did- not his fault at all."
What does the hawks being jay huff mean?
"Because Bennett wants all his big men to be like Jack Salt.  Set screen, hedge high, rawr.  He wasted ten years of Tobey and Jay Huff.  Tobey was never soft.  He could also shoot.  He was always a great rebounder and shot blocker, but God forbid he get a foul in the first four minutes.  Bench time."
Someone called Jay Huff is on Lakers' roster. Who he?
To be fair it's preseason lol. We got guys like Jay Huff and Jordan Goodwin closing out games
Jay Huff. Dude dropped a shit ton of points against my tiny ass high school. With me being 6’1 and having to guard him I got cooked.
We actually have Jay Huff on a two-way contract. He's pretty athletic for a 7-footer. He also shot almost 39% from 3 on 3 attempts a game in his last year in college. Wouldn't mind giving him a shot rather than playing DJ.
And Jay Huff is there for some reason as well.
Jay Huff!
I’m not saying Jay Huff ISNT elite…
Jay Huff has had more impact on defense in 8 minutes than Steph Curry has had as a starter in 15 games smh
"Ah yes, Sekou and Jay Huff LAL’s defensive pride and joy"
"Just look at the other names on the list. I'm on here every day and watch nba games literally every day and play fantasy every year.   I have no idea who Jay huff, Sekou Doumbouya and Kessler Edwards are. Obviously defensive win shares has some glaring flaws."
Yes only behind all time great defender Jay Huff.
we got Jay huff boi
Can Jay Huff possibly be worse than DJ?
Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Jay Huff  Unstoppable
