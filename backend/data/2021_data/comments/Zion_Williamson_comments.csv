kevin willis played against george mikan and zion williamson
"Poku is 7' tall, he's played 296 minutes and he has 10 field goal attempts from within 3 feet of the basket.  To put that into context, Zion Williamson has played exactly twice as many minutes and has 19 times more field goal attempts at the rim.  Zion, possibly coincidentally, takes lots of free throws."
"Who is he pushing out  West starters Steph Curry/Damien Lillard/Leonard/LeBron/Jokic  Backups Donovan Mitchell/Doncic/PG13/AD/Gobert  For the final two spots he needs to beat all but one of Karl Anthony Towns, SGA, De'Aron Fox, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, Ja Morant  On his own team Wall, Wood, and Gordon are all better than him too"
Zion Williamson? Yea the only ones hyping him up are the Pelicans and Adam Silver. Everyone else really doesn't give a shit lol.
Wow I love Zion Williamson

How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Zion Williamson on his 'Welcome to Cracker Barrell' moment: ""Kelvin Benjamin. It was seven meals of a ass whoopin' he was giving me. He had 17 plates, all before me. I got so full, I ran out of the restaurant  so damn fast."""
"Oh ok, so you would only inbound from a different spot on the court if the clock is past or under the 2 min. mark? That goes for any period of the game as well? Thanks also for your response. I am really trying to get into basketball. I was a ""hater"" for a long time and I think it's time I move past all that nonsense. I really like Zion Williamson. I've only seen some highlights but that dude seems like he's a fucking beast and I really want to watch him. If you have any recommendations on players to follow or teams to check out send them my way. Thanks again!"

"""mis-timed the lob""  Is this a homer commentator? Ignoring the fact that gargantuan Zion Williamson with a 100 inch vertical just got blocked."
"&gt;I'd make Zion my DE  Does Williamson know what defense is, though?  I'm not sure that ""Stand around and watch"" is optimal, for a defensive end.  I think he's a fullback.  Coach: ""Williamson, barrel into those 4 defenders!"" ZW: ""That's my favorite play!"""

"I saw Zion Williamson at a grocery store in New Orleans yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Zion Williamson has shot 58.5% through 40 career games.  According to @EliasSports that's the highest FG pct by any player in NBA history in their first 40 games (min. 500 FGA)  [Source](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1355531214535319556?s=19)

Sure. One Zion Williamson and 4 FRPs and it’s yours
Christian Wood: + 3.1 Overall DEF Raptor  Zion Williamson:  - 2.2 Overall DEF Raptor   One of these is added value on both sides of the court.
Best I can come up with: Vince Carter played against Rick Mahonrn (b. 1958) and Zion Williamson (b. 2000). 42 years.
"&gt;Curious how you chose the jazz game where he did worse offensively.  Curious how you said ""Watch either Jazz game"" and now you want a take-back on that.  &gt; Equally curious how often you write off fouls as superstar calls.   I mentioned that fact when it applied.  Gobert was furious about the foul call, exactly because he contests shots like that all-game every game, and doesn't get called against anyone else except Williamson.  &gt; You are incorrect in your point about Zion being rarely doubled.   Look at the plays I just posted!  He does not get doubled often at all!  &gt; watch the raptors game   How about you watch it, and log it, and post it.  I already did so, and we can see that I'm right, and you're wrong."
"&gt;You are genuinely not watching games if you think Zion doesn’t get doubled on almost every possession.  This is fantastically wrong, as you can see by the game logs I posted above!  Learn to read, and/or watch.  Williamson almost never gets double-teamed, despite what his fanboys would like to believe."
"Zion fucking Williamson...... over the Klaw....... jesus christ. And AD over Jokic? AD been straight cheeks this season. I have read youe responses in the comments and it seems you severely overrate fan votes. It doesnt really mattet how many fan votes, someone like Zion is not starting an allstar game when the coaches and players vote, hell he is not even making. Not even the best player on his team."
"Lamelo, Anthony Edwards, ja morant, Zion Williamson, SGA, Collin Sexton, the Celtics superstars (Brown and Tatum are both near superstars), Embiid , Ben Simmons , De’Aron Fox , there’s so much talent in the league rn you can go on and on ."
"&gt;Man is out to prove a point lmao  I admit, I find the legend of Zion fascinating.  If you listen to his fans, you would swear that opponents are running quadruple teams at him as soon as he crosses half-court, and despite that, he scores effortlessly against the entire NBA.  Reality is quite a bit different.    In reality, he accomplishes very little against NBA starters, and Van Gundy uses him basically as a sixth man -- almost exactly like Montrezl Harrell is used --  to take advantage of backup forwards who tend to be mediocre defenders, at best.  Even against those reserves, Williamson is rarely doubled, and teams invite him to shoot from 20+ feet any time he wants to.  He remains a raw prospect, but is being hyped outlandishly, and miles beyond what he's currently capable-of on the court."
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"&gt;You having typed up notes from one game doesn't mean you can jump to ""Zion gets occasional double teams"" for the whole season.  I did not jump to any conclusion.  I watched a bunch of Pelicans' games, and paid attention, and took notes.  Williamson is not receiving the amount of defensive attention that many people are claiming he does, and he is certainly not being constantly doubled on every touch."
"&gt;Williamson gets occasional double-teams -- just like many NBA players. That's the point.  No it isn't. He gets a way above average number of double teams (supplemented by his attitude of looking at two defenders at the rim and deciding to try and go for it anyway).  You having typed up notes from one game doesn't mean you can jump to ""Zion gets occasional double teams"" for the whole season."
"&gt;If you haven't seen how much teams are either doubling Zion on the catch or having him see extra bodies at the rim then I'm not sure you've seen many Pelican games.  This is an oft-cited legend, but not accurate.  Here, for one example, is how the Lakers recently defended Williamson.  Anthony Davis did take him a few times, but mostly they led Montrezl Harrell and Markieff Morris guard him alone.  Morris did struggle to guard Williamson, but Markieff Morris is making minimum wage for a reason.  1st quarter  8:13 Top-Of-Key PNR for Williamson, no double, throws ball into crowd  7:50 TOK drive, blocked by Davis  5:37 elbow extended, single coverage by Davis, passed  2:44 Harrell primary on left block, Davis doubled after a few dribbles and blocked shot from behind  2:09 TOK, single coverage by Morris, layup for Williamson  0:28 left block, single coverage by Morris, Williamson loses ball, turnover  2nd quarter  11:41 Pseudo PNR at TOK, then single coverage by Morris, Williamson scores 5' shot  11:05 semi-fast break, Harrell and Morris converge to stop layup, makes pass to Hayes for layup  10:20 Morris single at FT line, James floats around in a soft-double, Williamson drive left, and misses layup  9:08 left block, single coverage by Morris, passes out  8:18 drives against single from Morris on left wing, scores from 5' and 1  7:50 brings ball up, drives into lane against Morris and James, TO  3:47 intial coverage by Caldwell-Pope on right block, double by Caruso, passed out  1:10 TOK PNR with Reddick, Davis stays on Williamson, passes  0:45 Dribble hand-off from Adams at FT line, drives on Gasol after switch, missed 5' shot  3rd quarter  11:26 right wing, single from Davis, drives into lane, questionably fouled by Gasol helping  10:10 brings ball up left wing, single from James, passes off  9:15 brings ball up center, drives on Davis, questionably fouled by Gasol  6:04 catches pass in middle of lane, goes up against Davis, missed from 6'  4th  11:14 left wing, covered by no one, drives for a layup and 1  10:49 brings ball up right side, single by James, passes off  10:16 TOK, PNR, Matthews switches, dribbles around him, Morris recovers and forces TO  9:17 brings ball up right side, drives on Harrell, misses 5' shot  8:34 right block, initial coverage by Morris, passes out as Harrell comes to double  7:10 catches ball in lane, bowls over Harrell, misses short shot, gets own rebound, makes layup  6:47 left block, versus Davis, drives, makes layup  4:36 catches at FT line, drives left on Harrell, misses 5' shot  \--"

"I can believe great system and wanting to play for them, but Zion's Duke did not have an especially great system. The spacing of that Jones/Barrett/Reddish/Williamson/Bolden lineup was atrocious. They stole several games on late calls- Wake Forest in the regular season and UCF/VT in the tournament. Don't get me wrong, they weren't some bums, but it wasn't like watching the 2015 Spurs out there- I'd say current Gonzaga, the UVA team that won the title, and Jay Wright's title winning Villanova teams all had a better system from a tactical/roster construction perspective.   At the college level, when you have three NBA starters and two NBA bench players, you're talented enough to beat up on guys with less ability than you. Most of the starters on ACC teams won't see a minute of NBA action- and those are huge programs with big recruiting pools. Zion not playing like his Duke days has a lot to do with the step up in competition. He's still yet to play 50 NBA games, and has gone from a level where he was by far and away the best athlete on the floor to level where that isn't always the case. That's especially a problem on defense, where, just like every other rookie, he needs to learn to integrate his physical tools with schemes/reading and understanding the play."

Zion “despite the loss” Williamson has joined the club
"I agree, their GM needs to be called out. Trading for Steven Adams to pair with Zion Williamson who can’t shoot outside of 5 feet was one of the strangest moves I’ve seen. He got lucky the Bucks were in desperation mode and gave up a lot for Holliday, If they really wanted to compete this year they should have kept him. He had 2 years left on his deal. 29 year old sub All Star who is an excellent defender, I’d keep him over some late first round draft picks."

Lol.  We blew out the pelicans last night and espn's hot take from the game was about...you guessed it...Zion Williamson.
the Zion Williamson prototype
"Can you imagine if Zion Williamson, 21 year old professional NBA player responded to a mild criticism of his game by a retired NBA legend by saying ""well I never fucked a kid"", referencing a relatively obscure 30+ year old story from this other man's life that affects people Zion knows nothing about?  Do you know how immature, off-putting, controversial, and absurd that course of action would be? What sort of distraction that would bring?  I'm speaking to how society operates lol, i dont give a fuck if you call Karl Malone a pedophile. He fucked a 12 year old. Grow up,  and try to use your brain when reading comments."
"INGRAM'S DRIVE AND willingness to be coached date to the days and late nights he spent with his father, Donald, who played growing up and helped run the Martin C. Freeman Recreation Center in Kinston. After hours, Donald Ingram kept the center open for Ingram and his friends.  Ingram's father viewed his son's game as representing both his family and the rec center. ""He wasn't gonna be a sorry player, or an unskilled player,"" Donald Ingram said. ""I saw a lot of players caught up in fancy dribbling and 'AND1' basketball. I wasn't having that.""  They spent evenings working on dribbling and passing, sometimes using Brandon Ingram's friends as defenders and cutters. Ingram never asked for a day off.  Perhaps Ingram internalized the example of two working parents. For 23 years, Donald Ingram awoke before 4 a.m. to arrive early at the Crown Equipment Corporation forklift plant in Kinston. He got home shortly after 3 p.m., dozed in his recliner, and opened the rec center at 5 p.m. -- where he remained until at least 9 p.m. Editor's Picks      Lowe: Answering the massive questions driving this James Harden trade     Lowe's 10 things: Awesome Lakers, Zion boards and Dort (!)  At the rec center, Brandon Ingram played against men who tried to bully the skinny kid. On defense, Donald would rest his forearm on Ingram's waist, preventing him from moving forward. He demanded his son push back. ""Don't let nobody guide you with the ball!""  Donald Ingram played in various leagues against a younger Jerry Stackhouse, who became Brandon Ingram's AAU coach in Kinston and one of his mentors. During a gathering at Stackhouse's mother's home, Stackhouse challenged Ingram -- then around 12 or 13 -- to one-on-one. When Ingram got the ball, Stackhouse grabbed his off arm with both hands. ""You're not gonna let me hold you, are you?"" he asked. Ten seconds passed, maybe 20. ""Get my damn hands off you!"" Finally Ingram wrenched them off.  In Stackhouse's memory, they did not play one-on-one again until Ingram's senior year. ""He really came at me,"" Stackhouse said, ""and I knew he was ready.""  ""I don't think he wanted anymore smoke after that,"" Ingram said.  As Ingram's star rose at Kinston and on the AAU circuit, teammates and coaches admired how unselfish he remained.  ""He always made the right play,"" said Darnell Dunn, Ingram's teammate at Kinston and on Stackhouse's AAU team.  ""Everyone knew how talented he was,"" Stackhouse said. ""They were happy to say, 'You do you.' But he ain't the 'do you' type. He would hit the open man and know the ball might come back to him.""  The Pelicans have noticed more of that this season. Ingram is making simple plays to keep the offense moving. When defenses trap him, he slips the ball to Steven Adams:  When defenses ignore New Orleans' shaky shooters, Ingram kicks them the ball, confident they will exploit open space. Sometimes, the ball comes back to him -- just as it did in AAU:  ""He's making the right play, and that gets to be contagious,"" Van Gundy said.  In past seasons, Ingram would sometimes either miss simple passes or decline them. He often requested the Pelicans video crew send him compilations of passes he should have made but didn't.  ""The guy watches more film than any player I've been around except maybe Chris Paul,"" Redick said.  He might spot himself settling for midrangers or picking up his dribble when one more bounce would have unlocked something better -- a drop-off to Williamson, or a crosscourt pass for a corner 3.  The dilemma for New Orleans is that Ingram is both their best creator and the best shooter in their starting five. That means the Pelicans sometimes use him as a floor-spacer. It also means many Ingram kickouts go to below-average 3-point shooters.  ""It's my responsibility to have guys out there that can finish those plays,"" Van Gundy said.  If anything, there are possessions where it might be better for Ingram to force it. He has mostly demurred. ""I like his balance so far,"" Van Gundy said. ""You don't want someone who is just looking to pass, but you also don't want a pig.""  Ingram has become a more confident and polished finisher around the basket -- a prolific producer of free throws. Something clicked in the 2018-19 season, his rumor-filled final year with the Lakers, and the development accelerated in New Orleans. Ingram mastered his footwork -- when to use choppy steps in tight creases, and when to gobble up space with loping strides. He finally seemed to understand how long his arms are -- that he was on top of the rim sooner than he had perceived."
"SOMETIME IN OCTOBER 2019, Joe Boylan, then an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans, received an unexpected text from Brandon Ingram -- one of the franchise's new stars, acquired months earlier in the Anthony Davis trade.  ""I trust you now,"" the message began.  Ingram urged Boylan to coach him hard, invited Boylan to ""motherf---"" him if necessary, whatever it took. It was the same message Ingram had delivered to New Orleans higher-ups on his first day there, when he walked into the office of Jeff Bzdelik, then the Pelicans' lead assistant, and declared, ""I think I have greatness in me. I want you to get it out of me, and I don't care what you do,"" several in that room recalled.  Days after that text, Ingram arrived a few minutes late to his appointment at the training table. That was not unusual. Ingram is a night owl. Boylan lit into him in front of the training staff: ""This is why the Lakers got rid of you! This motherf---er wants to be great? No! He wants to be comfortable.""  Boylan's delivery was so over the top, everyone knew it was somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Boylan reminded Ingram that his lateness delayed players behind him on the schedule.  Ingram smiled and took it. ""I like being called out,"" he said. ""Players at this level think they're above that. I'm still a few minutes late sometimes, but I'm much better.""  Perry Tyndall, Ingram's coach at Kinston High School in eastern North Carolina, called out Ingram only once -- when Ingram shrugged and refused to make eye contact as Tyndall criticized Kinston's starters for losing to backups in practice. Tyndall ripped Ingram. He felt bad about it almost right away.  When Tyndall arrived home, he was surprised to receive a text from Ingram apologizing. ""I realized I'm being cussed at for a reason,"" Ingram said. ""If I'm the leader of this team, that is going to trickle down. I had to be sharper. I had to be on top of my s---.""  When Ingram and Stan Van Gundy met at Ingram's rental home in Miami in October for their first sit-down, Ingram told his new coach he was ready for heavy scrutiny. ""What struck me was how self-aware he was,"" Van Gundy said. Ingram admitted to Van Gundy that his defense had slipped as he embraced a larger scoring role. Ingram vowed to improve his playmaking. After earning individual glory -- plus a new five-year, $158 million contract -- Ingram was ready to focus on passing and defense.  ""One of the blessings of him being an All-Star and getting that contract is that he is at peace that you know he's really good,"" said David Griffin, the Pelicans' personnel chief. ""He's just playing his game.""  Van Gundy walked out of Ingram's house and called his brother, Jeff, a decorated coach and current analyst for ESPN. ""This guy,"" Van Gundy told his brother, ""is the real deal.""  Ingram is one of the most important swing players in determining the NBA's balance of power. If he becomes the player he thinks he can be -- a two-way superstar who approaches double digits in assists -- the Pelicans have a chance to contend for titles around Ingram and Zion Williamson. Boylan often told Ingram that New Orleans could win championships if he became their Scottie Pippen.  If Ingram plateaus as an average (or maybe worse) defender and B-plus passer, the Pelicans' ceiling won't reach as high.  Ingram is averaging 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game -- almost identical to his numbers last season. His shooting is down, but he's more dialed in on defense.  Teammates have noticed Ingram moving the ball earlier, but it hasn't resulted in the leap in assists his opening-night near triple-double against the Toronto Raptors portended.  ""That's what you should average,"" JJ Redick, a New Orleans guard, told Ingram after that game.  Redick has been exhorting Ingram since last season that he might average a triple-double, and become a top-10 player.  ""I'm not gonna stop until I'm the best,"" Ingram once replied."

"To be fair, Karl was a 15th pick, the team's #1 option was Adrian Dantley who was a forward and averaged 30 points per game, and the team had Thurl Bailey at PF who had a great year the year before, so Malone had to share minutes with him at the PF while Dantley was basically on the floor the entire game at SF. This was also a time when in the NBA when you always had a centre on the floor and would never put Malone at the 5. If Malone had the opportunity to play 40 minutes as a rookie, he would have, and I doubt he would have been gassed after 30. As soon as Dantley left, the jazz moved Bailey to the 3 and Malone basically averaged 40 min per season for the next 15 years.  Contrast that with Zion - an ultra-hyped #1 pick who can play the 3, 4 or 5 in today's NBA and has to share frontcourt minutes at 3 positions with Ingram, Steven Adams and..... Nicolo Melli???..... Hernangomez?????.......Jaxson Hayes?????????  Seriously, we're talking 144 possible frontcourt minutes per game at his position(s), and Zion Williamson, the league's most hyped prospect in a decade is averaging playing only 22.5% of them while sharing them with Ingram, Adams, Melli, Hernangomez and Jaxson Hayes. Does that make sense to anyone on paper?  The reality is, he frequently look totally gassed after being on the floor for 5 minutes, so it makes sense that he's only getting 30 minutes per game."

"Zion Williamson had, in my opinion, his best career game against Sacramento a few days ago. Scored over 30 points while shooting in the 80-90% range and had an absolute poster dunk. Will be interesting to see if he can continue this level of play."
"1st time All Stars should be De'Aaron Fox, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine in no particular order off the top of my head"
"Yeah I don't think it is going to end up a bad class. But there was no Anthony Davis, Karl Towns, Zion Williamson... clear #1 pick. For my own sake I hope Ant can be a Donovan Mitchell type one day, but that remains to be seen."

"&gt;If Zion can’t make it out of the first/second round  If he doesn't expand his game beyond bulling to the basket against backup forwards, and spectating on defense, New Orleans will be selling at the deadline and not even a threat to make the playoffs.  If Ingram drags this team to the playoffs, that's your new star right there.  And if he does, they'll probably get the Lakers in the first round, and all we will hear is ""Williamson takes on LeBron!"""

"The US does not give a fuck about European players lol. They're arguably some of the best in the league atm...  Doncic is looking like the future, but because he's not black or American he doesn't get half the credit he deserves.  Giannis is doing insaneeeee numbers in around 30 or less mins and he doesn't get half the credit, they're way quicker to say he flops in playoffs about him than they are about others. And don't consider that Middleton is a B-Grade 2nd all star.  Jokic is putting up crazy numbers and again, they won't highlight it the same.  Zion Williamson was getting the most hype since LBJ, if he was white/european I can promise this would not of happened lol"
"Malcolm Brogdon, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavine, Zion Williamson - not necessarily role players but none of them have been all stars (yet)."
"They'll be on TV, seen from the bench. A rookie who doesn't play is not going to get huge endorsement money.  Very few rookies are good enough to make the rotation of a contending team, and if they are, they are good enough to get a huge contract somewhere else AND endorsement money regardless of where they end up. Kyrie and LeBron had plenty of endorsements in Cleveland.  Do you know who the top 10 endorsement earners in the NBA are?  LeBron, Curry, Durant, Giannis, Westbrook, Zion, Harden, Irving, Lillard, Thompson.  &gt; The attraction of large media markets for free agents is a common point made by talking heads in sports media, as large markets presumably open doors for athletes to earn more endorsement opportunities.  &gt; However, three of the NBA’s top 10 endorsement earners — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, and Damian Lillard — all currently play in small-to-medium NBA markets. Additionally, Russell Westbrook had spent his career in Oklahoma City, the NBA’s smallest market, prior to joining the Houston Rockets this season.   &gt; While massive media markets may offer an advantage for off-court earning potential, this list shows that on-court success and personal brand building impact player endorsement value far more than the size of their market alone.   https://opendorse.com/blog/nba-top-10-endorsement-earners/  Zion would've got a near max equivalent and huge endorsements no matter where he went, he is not signing a minimum to ring chase as a 20 year old.  The idea that players go to New York or LA and immediately get big endorsements is based on pre-internet logic where you could only watch players on local tv. Knicks are the biggest market and have no players on that list. The only NY/LA players there were already superstars before joining. Giannis is doing just fine."
You think Zion Williamson would have signed with the Lakers for the MLE to back up Anthony Davis for 10 minutes a night?
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."

I think people's expectations for rookies has been really taken a turn for the worst in the social media era. Some people don't even think guys like Zion Williamson has lived up to the hype so far because of how they monitor his every game and expected so much out of the gates.        In reality I saw a stat the other day that said [that Zion has the most points of any player trough his first 33 games](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1347698616106954752?s=19) since Shaq in 1993!

"**Lolknicks** was most *certainly* a narrative.     Our front office was god-awful and we all knew it. However, the problem came with many media pundits and all sorts of people would find reason to bash and put us down when we haven't even done anything that warranted a put down.     Prime example: The whole KD &amp; Zion Williamson going to the Knicks story? Nobody from the Knicks' camp believed that narrative. But then the media started pushing it harder and harder, talking about it ALL the time.  All of a sudden, we gullible Knicks fans had hope that it might be true.     Didn't help that James Dolan's dumb self opened his mouth and spouted off nonsense prematurely.     **Then when the dust settles and it turns out to not be true, we get all the heat for even thinking that such a thing would come true, when we LITERALLY didn't even start the damn rumors.**     Hell, you can go on Twitter or any social media and people will bring up the Knicks out of context JUST to shit on us.     I *vividly* remember how some people were bringing our team up during the Bubble when we hadn't even played since ***March.***"

"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
Zion Williamson without hops...
Brandon Ingram. Zion Williamson.
"&gt; teams have so much control over draft picks that it doesn’t make sense...  What control? They could draft him for 3 years. And have him leave in free agency. How is that a championship building strategy?  Fortunately for us fans, this situation doesn't occur often. Most NBA rookies come from poor families. They care more about the guaranteed money than their legacy in a big market. For example, Zion Williamson being content playing for NOP. Despite the disgusting New York media pleading for him to sit out the draft one more year.  Luka is not in the same boat. He was already financially secure from playing in Euroleague. The only other example I'm aware of is Steph Curry. Came from a rich upbringing. Dad ""asked nicely"" for King's GM to not draft his son."
That 2006 team got destroyed by a Greek version of Zion Williamson. Noone could stop him. Dude just bullied everyone who tried to defend him.
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."

Can you imagine if Zion Williamson got ahold of BoingVert lessons?
Zion Williamson
"The crux of this issue is mathematical and quantitative, the intersection of several linear equations, it isn't qualitative.  It isn't correct to generalize any scenario without looking at the player profile.   For example, if you are giannis you should never take a 17 footer unless the shot clock is below 2.  The inefficiency of the shot never makes it worth players playing up on giannis.  They won't change their scheme.  He can take as many as he wants, its always a bad shot and the defense knows that.    Even when defenses play irrationally, e.g. over-guarding kawhi who is a great not elite jump shooter, the value added to his other shots is still marginal given the borderline utility of his 40-45% midrange jumper.  Kawhi should be taking significantly less midrange jumpshots than he does, but not zero.  Then you have Kevin Durant who shoots historically well from the midrange around 53% and probably even higher when excluding low shot clock plays.  Even then, he probably takes too many.  It may be a health concern at this point which is why I qualify that statement, but on golden state his overreliance on the midrange over taking 3s was one of the inefficiencies of that team.  He already had open lanes to the basket with curry and thompson on the floor, he didn't need 40% of his shots to come from 14-23 feet.   He could have taken 20% and achieved the same shot quality on more efficient field goal attempts.  Zion williamson is an example of a perfect analytical player.  20 points per game in the paint, takes 3s only when wide open and never takes midrangers.  80% of his shots come from the restricted area and he hits nearly 70% of them.  This is what happens when you balance your ranges appropriately and don't compromise shot selection when you can achieve the same shot quality."

That's genuinely annoying and unfair.  But here's the flipside.  24-year-old Devin Booker isn't competing with 20-year-old (essentially in his rookie year in terms of games played) Zion Williamson. You'd be comparing 2015 Devin Booker to current Zion Williamson.  Was 2015 Devin Booker on a record list with Wilt Chamberlain and Kevin McHale?

"I'll copy my comment from [Per Lord Zach Lowe - If you are going to complain about a snub, you have to also indicate who they would replace. Feel free to do so below.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lrglig/per_lord_zach_lowe_if_you_are_going_to_complain/) I also added in the RAPTOR and WAR rating from 538 into this table, and could have edited the body of this argument when considering those, but I have not.  -  DeMar is the clear number 1 on the team with a worse starting unit, although a far better bench. He's playing more efficient than DBook (but less than Zion), and I believe his assist numbers make up for the difference in scoring. If you look at pretty much every major advanced statistic beyond TS%, DeMar is far better than Booker.  In the past I've found coaches have used 3 main criteria to vote in players:  1. Individual performance.  2. Team performance.  3. Teammates that are already all stars.  There are of course exceptions to the above, but with 2 similarly ranked teams in playoff spots we rarely get 2 players from 1 team and 0 from the other. Coaches have typically used some combination of the above and then obviously compared them to the level of competition within the conference (which is why Booker has had a harder time the last few years before WB and Harden left). I suppose this example is not great when just in the East this year the Raptors and Pacers have 0 to the Nets 3 and Celtics 2.  I'll list the main box scores/advanced stats (from basketball-reference.com) below for all 3 players. I've included assist points created (from NBA.com - although these all seem too high and I couldn't find a good definition on the site) and points responsible for because so many people are overlooking DeMar's extra assists.

Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
"cuz this net rating thing, is just a subjective advanced stat (some websites even measure it differently). It correlates very very strongly with team results. you can put Kevin Durant on worst team in the league and odds are that he will have negative net rating.   I will give you a few more players with negative net rating:  Zion Williamson (-0.6), Beal (-4.4), Demar (-1.1), Fox (-7.2), Vucevic (-8), Sga (-7), Bam (-0.9), Lavine (-1.5)  while we have such: DiVicenzo (+12.1), Royce Oneal (+11.3)   So basically, if your team is doing good - your net rating is probably good, if your team is doing bad - its probably bad. How much impact you had on team doing good/bad? debetable. but you cant make much argument that Divicenzo is better than guys listen above.  And in my opinion Pacers doing not so hot has a lot more to do with missing Warren Oladipo/Levert for so long + some role players for shorter period times (Turner, Mcconel, Lamb etc) than with Sabonis ""bad"" play."

"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"Probably Zion, but mostly due to team record and assists; Williamson has the advantage in scoring and rebounding anyway."

"Right now? Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Zion Williamson are the ones that come to mind for me. Those are all guys who you can look at and go ""damn, how do you guard that??"" I *want* to put Giannis in that category, but teams seem to have figured out a pretty workable way to guard him, at least until someone on the Bucks coaching staff figures out that just because you *can* let him handle the ball every possession doesn't mean you *should.*"

"And on the flipside, here's Zion hyping up BI:  &gt;*Zion Williamson calls Brandon Ingram ""built for those moments"" when he hit him with a pass that led to THE important three-pointer, putting the Pelicans ahead 115-112 with 34.4 seconds left in OT.*  I love it."

"Zion ""beyblade"" Williamson"
"Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Miles Bridges for sure.  Others I'd love to see: Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine (Again)"
"Here's a further explanation provided and you Zion is more box office than you think.  Don’t be fooled, this is an impressive number. Not only does it include an aforementioned Zion absence, but the draw was insanely TV-unfriendly. We’re talking about games against the Grizzlies, Rockets, Jazz, Hornets and the Suns (twice). Basically, the league gave the Pelicans a bunch of national games but made them prove themselves. In my opinion, they’ve markedly exceeded expectations, especially when you consider that New Orleans is the league’s smallest (and perhaps least engaged) market. The upshot: Zion Williamson is a box office star. It was true at Duke and it’s true in the NBA."
He basically would be Zion Williamson
"Ja Morant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Zion Williamson, Lebron James"
In response to point A:  Top Selling NBA Jerseys (Jan 2020-Oct 2020)  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jayson Tatum 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kyrie Irving 10. Russell Westbrook 11. Kawhi Leonard 12. Zion Williamson 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kemba Walker 15. James Harden
"You perceived it as defensive. I'm not zion williamson. I don't care if you call him a bumbling hippo. It doesn't mean you are right. I do actually watch him play every game. His conditioning was a problem. But he's fine now. And as a result, his effort is also fine now. But for all of his faults, he is still producing at incredible levels relying on excellent polish around the basket with his left hand and adding a capable 3pt shot when warranted. To say he is just conserving his energy and not playing hard is kind of beginner. You don't statistically dominate at your position just coasting."
"A classic post from last year might help: [flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/atygt5/oc_a_flowchart_for_choosing_an_nba_team_to_root/)! Also maybe could use updating. I wanted to second that it's a solid idea to pick a player who you like watching and not get caught up in weird fandom gatekeeping. Find out team/player styles you enjoy watching and do that by watching as many teams as you can. The big young guns from the 2019 draft are Zion Williamson (Pelicans) and Ja Morant (Grizzlies), who have much different playstyles but are both fun to watch. 2020 was less hyped a draft class, but LaMelo (Hornets) and Haliburton (Kings) are starting to get some attention.  LeBron is the current era's best player and biggest name to follow, but there are so many, many stars/great players in the league now that you'll eventually find someone to follow."
I'm new back in it too...I say follow Pelicans cause newest team and Zion williamson is awesome and also young new player
Doc rivers tried closing a game with Morris at the 5 vs Joel Embiid last year....and then basically never did it again the rest of the year   I like the idea of bev/batum/PG/Kawhi/Morris and they put batum on KAT in a game last week doubling when needed and it worked. But 74% shooting allowed at the rim with Morris at the 5 just turning anybody who comes inside into Zion Williamson lol.
Myles Turner Zion Williamson 3&amp;D wing 3&amp;D wing De'Aron Fox maybe?  But just a stretch 5 next to Lonzo Hart Ingram Zion might be enough too.
Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Zion Williamson  KAT
"Brandon Ingram is trash. Screw him man. During the final quarter when only Williamson was on the court the Pelicans were in full flight, but then Ingram came back on, took all those garbage shots like he doesn't want to be outdone by Williamson or something and they started losing again. There was a even a moment where he saw Zion was wide open, fake pumped to pass to him but then decided to go for an extremely difficult shot right in front of a defender (and missed). He's a horrible horrible team mate."
###HOW DO YOU LET LONZO AND BI SHOOT 3s INSTEAD OF PASSING TO ZION 'BUCKET TO GO' WILLIAMSON LMAO
Give the ball to Zion Williamson in crunch time  Thank you
"Zion ""shaq"" Williamson"
"is this thread really asking ""does zion williamson get enough hype"" ?"
Ja Morant is who Zion Williamson thinks he is
Did you guys know that ~~Dwight Howard~~ Zion Williamson and ~~Josh Smith~~ Ja Morant played on the same AAU team???
In some alternate universe we have Luka Doncic and Zion Williamson
Zion Williamson: 64.7% Lebron James:59.7%  That's a massive difference and the reason why Zion is a better offensive player than Lebron
He's the new Zion Williamson!
The anti-Zion Williamson
Zion “Seth “Steph “Dell Curry” Curry” Curry” Williamson
"Honestly think Kuzma is perfect at his role. Love to see when players fit so well on a team like a piece of a puzzle. I still remember how he was getting bodied while guarding Zion Williamson, but damn did he go all out. Need that typa devotion from players on a championship caliber team haha"
"No. Put Lamelo on the Pelicans and he’d form a young ‘Big 3’ and be the facilitator star. Sort of like young Kd, Kyrie, Beard where Melo plays Beard’s role, not the highest scoring, but mad assists.  He’d have zion to throw lobs to who’s basically the star version of Miles Bridges. If Melo can make Bridges have highlights on nba.com like that, imagine him and zion.   The reason why Lonzo has no highlights with zion is because he’s not a scoring threat. Teams slack off him and double zion because he can’t score. Melo is a walking PnR with williamson. He’s a star."
"I think there's a lot more ""folks like [me]"" out there than a lot of marketers want to admit. That seems to be the crux of this post.  The value proposition of a pair of basketball shoes, for me, can't be ""Zion Williamson wears them."" Because I don't care. And neither do the very vast majority of people."

"And as everybody expected the best Pelican on that list iiiisss... Zion ""leagues worst defender"" Williamson at 18th with 42.9% (130/303)."
"yeah if you think Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish, Barrett, and Tre Jones when they were in college could compete with Real Madrid or Olympiacos I can't help you"
"You just gave a great example... That Duke team with Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish, Barrett, and Tre Jones couldn't compete with a top Euro-league team? I'm not talking about Euro League Team featuring Gasol or an extreme outlier in Luka.  Remember LaMelo Ball with his ragtag group was playing 2nd Div in Lithuania.  They were doing just fine. Yea they struggled against 1st division competition.  But it wasn't to the level of being non-competitive.  I literally gave you instance of 4 teams 2012 UK, 1998 UK, 2001 Duke, you can throw in 1999 UConn. Then you have 2009 UNC,2007 Florida that were college teams loaded with above-average NBA talent, and were above average as soon at they took the floor the following year. Thats 6 teams in 22 years that just won the NCAA Championship.  That excludes Teams like Zion's Duke Team, or Wall/Cousin's UK Team, or the UCLA Team with Love, Westbrook, Memphis who had D-Rose, CDR, and Joey Dorsey who didn't win the title.  You are trying to argue, that a team who's BEST player is at best a rotational player in the NBA can beat a college team with multiple players who are capable of being rotational players or starters.  Look at those roster's of the teams I provided, and look what they did in their NBA careers within 3 years of being in the NBA.  Now overlay that Euroleague Teams and their Rosters.  I personally wouldn't bet my life savings on that game.  I'm saying I wouldn't take a bet on who would win that game.  Because I know how 'high-end' talent works in the Basketball.  Its not that crazy.  Its no different than saying a top 4x400 USA College Team could make the an Olympic Finals or WC Finals.  Now its very easy to measure because we have a stop watch.  Why is it possible? Because again, they may have 3 guys who are 'Good' who can run low 46s and high 45s.  But they prob all have a absolute workhorse Michael Norman who can compete individually on the world stage. Running 44s and lower."

Khalil Mack and Zion Williamson
"Cade Cunningham - Trevor Lawrence: Tall/Big generation talents that every team wants  Patrick Beverly - Jalen Ramsey (ramsey a lot better but the attitude and skillset): Defensive focused players in LA that are aggressive, get a lot of fouls, talk shit and love to take on the star player of the other team, heart and soul of team  Daniel Jones RJ Barrett:Young top 10 picks out of 2019 Duke that have been really good but sometimes inconsistent. Are both doubted and underrated by media  Kyler Murray Devin Booker or Lamelo Ball: Young exciting prospects out of Arizona (Besides Ball) that will be top players in the future  Aaron Donald Rudy Gobert: Large players that impact the entire defense of their team  DK Metcalf/Zion Williamson: Large freak athletes with a really bright future in the league  Baker Mayfeild Lonzo Ball: Top picks in their respective class that haven't panned out but are still good players, Lonzo is a lot like a QB and they both have been overshadowed by better players in their draft"
Because that's only one part of his game and his overall efficiency is not as remarkable by comparison to some other players who also have large offensive roles.

"""stop making excuses"" bruh you're out here embarrassing yourself over your jesus figure being compared to literally zion fucking Williamson and you won't even look up what happened the past 5 games like wut"
Here's an excellent video analysis of his game and how he can still improve from Ben Taylor at the Thinking Basketball YouTube channel:  [Zion Williamson is breaking defenses | Inside his crazy scoring &amp; rapid growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjEgkg89ms)
"IDK what Pelicans are going to do.  Everything you said *plus* his teammates love him. Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson love him. When he was slumping earlier this year they both vouched hard for him and hyped him up.  We're not as desperate for point guards as the Bulls/Knicks are. We have two forwards who like to run point plus a handful of more guards, but it doesn't make the situation any less tricky."
"The answer is somewhat complicated, but the answer is basically: Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Kira Lewis Jr."

"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."

"Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Lauri Markennen, Karl Anthony-Towns, Kristaps Porzingis all did well in their rookie year.  Just from the last 5.  He doesnt need to dominate, but Wiseman just looks so lost out there."
"Do athletic players careers not last as long? I always hear about this but I am not sure this really is the case. We all know about Derrick Rose who suffered an injury or someone like Cam Newton in the NFL but athletic players can afford to lose a step while borderline slow players can't. Like Kevin Love and Blake Griffin are both the same position and same age and 1 was an athletic freak while the other one was very skilled. They are both dropping off at around the same age. Zion Williamson isn't just really athletic, he also has really great BBIQ so I think he can be someone who continues to develop skills as he ages like Karl Malone and Lebron James did."

"zion williamson, known nba ironman"
I heard Danny had Trae Young no 2 in his 23 and under prospect rankings ahead of Zion Williamson a few weeks ago lol.
I have no problem believe Zion Williamson is a top
Comments like these are the easiest way to tell who actually watches and knows basketball and who doesn’t.   Jimmy Butler is probably a better overall basketball player than Zion. Zion Williamson this season has been better than Jimmy Butler.  Both can be and are 100% true. You would know that if you actually watched the games and not the box scores.
"&gt;I don’t think anyone has ever expected any NBA player to start doing that. Steph was special from the start though. I won some nice money from his March Madness tourney  Zion Williamson, Tim Duncan, Shaq, LeBron, John Wall, Kevin Durant     For Prep to Pro, I would say LeBron was definitely the most apparent, then Zion then John Wall. Those are players I could have seen in High School just go straight to NBA and I would feel completely comfortable drafting them extremely high if it meant I would get shot in the back of the head if they weren't an all-star.     &amp;#x200B;  Shaq and Tim definitely showed during college, not so much during high school but idk if that is because of lack of broadcasting games in high school/college nationally so not AS much attention but they were definitely apparent in college.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  KD definitely showed in college, idk about High School. I'm not too informed."
"I didn't mean to imply that. My point was that I just lived through the retirements of all the greats of my early fandom, and that it is hard to say goodbye to the players you idolized when you started following the league.   I am very excited about the new generation as well, but it's a bit different being a fan as an adult. I am never going to save up money for a Zion Williamson shoe, put up a Luka poster above my bed, or open 10 packs of basketball cards looking for a Lamelo Ball rookie card."
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are better than Zion Williamson. Zion is looking good though, at least he did last night for long stretches."

"1. It’s an extremely rare scenario already, most leagues that already allow this require the person to be trans for a few years, which shoots down the argument of someone like Zion Williamson just declaring he is a woman and joining the wnba  2. We need to orient ourselves in a society that already treats trans people like shit to be more inclusive and welcoming. Trans people dominating women sports has not been and will not be a large scale problem. What is already a large scale problem is the system abuse and discrimination of trans people."

PG: Chris Paul  SG: JR Smith  SF: Zion Williamson  PF: David West  C: Anthony Davis  I had to do a little positional flexibility
I remember when he was in high school and was ranked the number 1 prospect of the 2019 draft class (over Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett) before he reclassified to the 2018 draft class. I can't help but root for him to prove everyone wrong after he has been declared a bust.
"They're definitely shaping up to be great. Not saying you were one of them, but every single year, people say ""this draft class is *soooo ass*"" or it's ""*so top heavy it's not even worth getting picks*"" because they just regurgitate everything they hear without looking into any prospects, and then the draft class comes up and performs amazingly and develops into great, well-rounded players. If a draft class doesn't have a Zion Williamson or Lebron James, it's a fucking bust class.   Sorry, tangential rant."

Zion Williamson is going to be a top 5 talent. I'm pretty sure he'll improve enough on the defensive end to warrant this spot.
"Guy...committing to building around Zion means keeping the 23 year old all star that fits him offensively and matches his timeline perfectly lol. This trade is heavily in the Warriors favour in every way. Like I said in my previous comment, there are a ton of moves they can make to shore up their defence before selling Ingram for pennies on the dollar. Swing a trade for Myles Turner for instance. Wiseman isn’t been a good defender ffs and it isn’t even remotely guaranteed that he becomes a defensive anchor.  Wiseman does not space the floor in any way, shape or form. Shooting a good percentage on very small volume isn’t spacing the floor. No player in the NBA is leaving Zion Williamson, the most dominant paint scorer in the league, to close out on James Wiseman at the 3 point line."

I think everyone is overreacting. This is just Meyers's latest move to relate with some of the elite players in the league. He's been reading up on Farrakhan. It was reported last time the Heat played the Pelicans that he asked Zion for an invite to a Williamson family gather so that he can pick the Elder Williamson's brains.

"Try to turn Bledsoe, Lonzo, Adams into:  Myles Turner, Kyle Lowry  Maybe a sign and trade featuring Lonzo/Adams to get Lowry this offseason, and then whatever you need try to get Myles turner while also getting rid of Bledsoe. Gonna have to throw some picks in to get him.   Ideally that turns your starting lineup in New Orleans into:  Kyle Lowry, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Myles Turner  That is certainly a playoff caliber starting 5, maybe even a team that can get home court advantage. At that point you need to fill in the bench. I'm not educated enough on their bench pieces now to know who is worth keeping, but Lowry and Turner would be my Plan A."
"And I'd actually say that's totally fair, but that isn't what the statement was which is why I said it's stupid.  Here's the quote that jumps out: ""Quite frankly, he's injured now because of the open season there's been on Zion Williamson in the paint.""  He was injured on a clean play and was barely contacted all game by anyone on the warriors. David is trying to use a play that has nothing to do with Zion not getting calls to highlight that he doesn't get calls, that's really stupid imo."
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"I mean if we’re telling anecdotes, literally everyone I know would say “Yes I know who Zion Williamson is”. Even those who don’t follow basketball.  Like, to say that the most hyped basketball prospect since LeBron hasn’t been in the spotlight for years is ridiculous. The kid had a million followers on Instagram in highschool. The spotlight was shined squarely on him since highschool, at least until he went to NOLA."

"Who won: Chris. This feels like the best combination of roles. True playmaker, two defend-and-defer guys who aren't useless on offense, pure scorer, and a two-way guy. Malik's team is gonna be ass on defense, Simon's team is alright but a little weak defensively (with Simmons being the only average or positive defender on the whole thing), Nate's team has worse spacing than the 2019-2020 76ers, Sasha's team is solid but I have serious doubts about a Trae/Fox backcourt due to defensive issues, and there may be too many mouths to feed on offensive.    What I would do with the same graphic:   PG: LaMelo Ball, $2  SG: SGA, $3  SF: Mikal Bridges, $1  PF: Zion Williamson, $5  C: Bam Adebayo, $3."

"* Zion Williamson and **Chris Paul**. CP3's playmaking can help open the floor for Zion, and he won't be taking shots away from him like other ball-dominant guards. Also, the lobs would be fun. Bam Adebayo is another good option, a solid secondary playmaker who can cover for Zion's defensive limitations thanks to his versatility.  * LaMelo Ball and **Nikola Jokic**. LaMelo has thrived this year thanks to Hornets' ball-sharing system, which lets him function as a playmaker and an off-ball threat. Jokic is the perfect fit for that, even if Melo/Jokic would be serviceable at best on defense. Of course, if Melo-Jokic pick and pops aren't your speed, Melo-Zion would also be fun, again because of lobs.  * Tyrese Haliburton and **Damian Lillard**. Hali doesn't iso a lot, usually having others set up his shots for him, but is a great playmaker. Dame can create his own shot with ease, but isn't a spectacular playmaker, and can be worn down if he has to have the ball in his hands on every possession. The strengths perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Hali and Steph would also be a really fun pairing, or Hali and Jimmy Butler."

"Yes, it's called a Ring of Protection. It's an official strategy of the NBA.   The primary flaw with the concept is that if the Ring of Protection moves and bowls over someone, it's an offensive foul.   The Ring of Protection would actually work better with wide, stocky players like Zion Williamson and Kyle Lowry's butt, and then have a taller shooter like Kevin Durant who can see over stuff fine and has a high release point. With that, you can create wide open shot after wide open shot.  Unfortunately, it's like the granny style free throw. While it's the most effective offensive strategy in the game, the coach's are too pussy to do it in an actual game to avoid being teased by their peers. However, don't be surprised if Tom Thibodeau breaks it out in game 7 of the NBA Finals this year."
He made his first 4 threes in a row to start his career. I remember watching that and thinking the league was just over.   [https://www.nba.com/news/zion-williamson-numbers-and-quotes](https://www.nba.com/news/zion-williamson-numbers-and-quotes)  I imagine in the next couple seasons he will try to work on his 3 like Giannis did. He's already the most prolific paint player since Shaq.

Coaching maybe? I've seen a lot of players not named Zion or Williamson shooting the ball
"Stephen Curry: Captain America - Aim, Endurance, Handles  Damion Lillard: Daredevil - Aim, Handles, Hops  Kyrie Irving: Punisher - Cruel &amp; relentless during a lead, Aim, Handles  Zion Williamson: Beast - Strength, Intelligence, Agility  Nikola Jokic (Yeah, yeah, his nickname is, ""Joker""): Cable - Aim, Strength, Unlimited Dimes  Luka Doncic: Gambit - Aim, Handles, Luck/Likelihood (he leapt through a double-team to LOB a game winning 3)   There are more players and way more superheroes."
"Because when my little sister, who couldn’t pick LeBron James out of a lineup, came to my house earlier she said “hey is that Zion Williamson?”"
"That was the reasoning...  From July 27 2020...  &gt; Canceling the end of the regular season was unfair to New Orleans. In March, with budding megastar Zion Williamson back from injury and a highly favorable schedule, the Pelicans arguably should have been favored to make the playoffs even though they were 3.5 games down on the Grizzlies with under 20 games to go. At the time, FiveThirtyEight gave New Orleans a 60 percent chance to qualify for the postseason, despite the big deficit.  -Rodger Sherman, The Ringer"

"It really depends on the guy.  Statistically, Vince Carter hit his peak at 24, Chris Paul hit his at 22 and Zion Williamson maxed out at age *20*.  Sometimes they keep getting better, sometimes they don't."
Zion Williamson
"As someone who follows this shit closely / played football and tries his best to not just parrot what the hype is, I think his stock is along the lines of Anthony Davis or Zion Williamson- the clear-cut unanimous first overall pick with enormous potential.  A lot of people are grouping him in with, say, a LeBron James (or Peyton Manning) kind of ""guaranteed handful of 1st team all-pros"" kind of deal and I don't buy that hype. To me, that was Joe Burrow last season, and he was a top-15 MVP candidate as a rookie until he got his leg ripped off.  Personally I see Lawrence having a Drew Brees-like career: Almost always top-10 (post-rookie season), usually hovering around top-5, but never the best QB in the league. Going to the playoffs a lot, but only winning one ring. Still a HoF career, but people acting like he's the next GOAT QB are going to be disappointed imo."

Zion Williamson. … I said last year, (the Knicks) didn’t have a superstar. And now they got a superstar.""*  Other than a sort of jokey comment from Enes, why are they being compared like this?  Zion is 20 years old and has played 79 games.  Julius is 26 years old and has played 435 games."
"In the bubble Zion Williamson approached CJ McCollum and pulled him aside - “Hey, that gumbo (CJ's Fatgainer 9000) you gave me was good,” McCollum recalls Williamson telling him. “A lot of people don’t know I like food, and I don’t know a lot about it, but I know that shit was good.”"

"My favorite player is LeBron, and I've liked him ever since he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine like 20 years ago. But I would advise you not to be a LeBron stan.  Here's some young and exciting players that I love to watch:   \- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City** \- Crafty young point guard with an all-around skillset   \- **Lamelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets** \- Great passer and playmaker, and still super young   **- Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies -** Explosive athlete, a point guard who plays above the rim   **- Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings -** Smooth, reliable guard who plays like a veteran  Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young are all really good and young, but they already get lots of fanfare."

This is how I recently got more into the NBA. There was this kid in high school that was absolutely destroying everybody named [Zion Williamson](https://youtu.be/MYnpO03crr8).

NEXT ON FIRST TAKE: ZION WILLIAMSON ELATED AT THE THOUGHT OF PLAYING BASKETBALL IN NEW YORK CITY   [STEPHEN A.](https://i.imgur.com/e2v9xuk.jpg) COULD WE SEE THE YOUNG STAR FORCE HIS WAY TO NY IF THE PELICANS FAIL TO MAKE THE PLAY-IN?!
Can y'all help me settle an argument with my friend? I think I can beat Zion Williamson in arm wrestling but she disagrees with me... What do y'all think?
"I honestly don't watch sports media at all. I watch a lot of games and then come here for the amalgamation of news and highlights. I don't bother with interviews or talking heads.   In the tiniest bit of Rachel Nichols coverage I've seen she seemed drunk and was intent on making a pre NBA Zion Williamson say something negative about Barret and Morant, and also tried to get him to be honest about how he feels going to New Orleans (I'm pretty sure this was draft lottery coverage). He's not even on a team yet and she was trying to get him to say something that could rub the people holding his golden ticket the wrong way.  Fuck Rachel Nichols, fuck ESPN, and fuck just about all sports coverage outside of the small teams that do the broadcasts/play by play and actually interact with them team."

To suggest a quick return to play and a condensed schedule has had no effect on the NBA product or the health and safety of the NBA's marquee athletes is willful ignorance."
Nba gave the pelicans a play in tourny lifeline and they won't even be able to get into that. All they gotta do is not be a bottom 5 team with zion williamson but apparently that a bit much to ask.
"I'd put him ahead of PG right now, and if he keeps up this hot streak he could pass Butler by the end of the playoffs. solidly in the 12th-15th range by the end of the year. The only real caveat to that is who else is looking dangerous for those spots, guys like Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell and Zion Williamson are all one big year away from also being in the top 5/10/15 etc. conversations. JT is probably the best of that group of guys competing and with Murray/Mitchell injured it likely helps build his case.   good point tho I am a bostonian and huge C's fan and hearing people say Tatum is already a top 10 player is just too soon. maybe once the current old guard (LBJ, Dame, Kawhi) start to go on the downswing he can shoot up"
"&gt; you want pay for something voluntary  Whether you joined it voluntarily or not has nothing to do with whether athletes should be paid when they're making money for their schools. I voluntarily applied for my job, doesn't mean that I'm not expected to be paid.   &gt; but don’t have a plan for it to be equal?  Why would Zion Williamson be paid the same as some random bum on a D3 school?"
Zion Williamson has to be the surest I've been on anybody since LeBron
The Seattle Supersonics select Zion Williamson in the 2025 expansion draft.
Lamelo Ball has more instagram followers than Patrick Mahomes or Zion Williamson.
This will be the 3rd HC in 3 seasons for Zion Williamson lol
"&gt;With Luka clearly being the most valuable player in the NBA from a Front Office standpoint, who is the second most valuable player in the league?  &gt;A few things matter to this I feel. Age, offensive skill, defensive skill, contract, and that x-factor.  &gt;Candidate wise a few guys come to mind. Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, LeBron James, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell  &gt;Who do you guys think the second most valuable player is in the NBA and if you have the time, why?  &gt;Edit: I forgot Jokic"
Zion Williamson
"All-NBA 4th team:  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Kevin Durant  I guess Russ on the 5th team? Damn, so many good guards"
"Oh I think there is a good chance he's going, I was just listing people that have sorta indicated that they're going.  He's on the [list of possible players.](https://olympics.com/en/news/zion-williamson-trae-young-basketball-olympic-roster)  Zion would certainly be a good PF option for us, potential starter if no KD/LeBron.  However if both KD and LeBron want to go I'd see Zion getting bounced."
Um ever heard of a guy named Zion Williamson or a guy named Rajon Rondo…
Did you know Zion National Park was named after NBA legend Zion Williamson
Zion Williamson vs Ngannou who you got
"""Anyway here's why we can trade Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and a future second for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Zion Williamson"""
"&gt;. Ingram and Ball couldn’t even make the playoffs with Zion.  So you are saying Williamson, who literally stood and watched on defense, is nearly as good as LeBron James?"
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."

Divac messed up the kings bad why 1 because he could have drafted luka however most people don't realize this when buddy heild got traded to sac for cousin's  new Orleans  offered 2 firsts the kings said no and 3 weeks later divac took the deal for only 1 st rounder well that other first became zion williamson  so the kings technicaly  would have a starting lineup of  Pg fox  Sg heild  Sf doncic  Pf zion  C Holmes   Talk about a legit team and would be one of the top 5 nba teams  plus we most likely wouldn't have signed Barnes to a 20 mill deal heild would have signed for much lower and most likely we would have a big time center since everyone would have been on rc deals
"Eh, its a lot easier ask to get people in Georgia to back the Hawks than to get nationwide randos to care about Zion Williamson.  I feel like the NFL gets this. The NBA keeps trying to capture the magic of Mike Jordan. They got Lucky with Lebron and now they think it is sustainable."
"&gt;Not the person you were replying to but: &gt; &gt;Well, there’s 11 players currently in their prime who have already won it once or gotten pretty damn close: Steph, LeBron, Jokic, Giannis, KD, Harden, PG, Kawhi, Dame, Embiid, AD. &gt; &gt;There’s at least 11 young players who have already proven they have all-NBA potential in their careers, so they could still improve and become MVP candidates if they aren’t already. Luka, Williamson, Morant, LaMelo, Mitchell, Murray, Young, Ayton, SGA, Booker, Tatum. &gt; &gt;That’s already 22 and there’s way more players that *could* win it we haven’t even mentioned.  Your first 11, PG13 will never win a MVP or even get close again. Dame will never win one either. I doubt AD ever wins one if he didnt in NO. So let's take the 1st 2 off your list and bring that number more realistic to 9.   Your 2nd 11. Luka and Zion are the only two even close to MVP right now. We arent talking about ""maybe, hopefully could be"". Do the others have the potential? Maybe. Are they current contenders? Not even a little bit. Other wise we could just say ""well there will be 50 different MVPs at some point the nba history"".  So you have 11 with some serious stretches even in that 11."

"Yeah that’s what I just said. And nobody is a superstar when they come into the league, unless we’re talking about from a marketing perspective because Lebron James and Zion Williamson were definitely “superstars” before they ever suited up professionally.

#DeAndre Hunter - Made the Playoffs  #RJ Barrett - Made the Playoffs  #Ja Morant - Made the Playoffs  #ZION WILLIAMSON - PLAYOFF VIRGIN
What the hell are you talking about how has Devin Booker failed but Zion Williamson hasn’t? They’ve both put up great numbers on losing teams. Your point has no consistency bro
Okay so by that logic so has Zion Williamson but he still gets the acknowledgment. That’s the confusion
LOL even if he’s Zion fucking Williamson it’s not the first quarter of some regular season game to be messing around with yamming dunks as hard as you can like you’re in your backyard with the kids.  Like who does this shit in Double OT of the playoffs in a 2-2 series? What a joke.
Zion Williamson. I love that he wouldn't complain to the refs even guys were climbing up onto his arm.
"But see, he hits Zion Williamson like that I doubt he even knocks him off his feet. The landing shouldn’t make what a flagrant foul is, that to me is a good hard playoff foul, go for the block and don’t shy away from body contact if they want to get physical."
Would Lou Williamson be Zion with a jumper or Lou Will with a post game

"Imagine a 17 year old Zion Williamson body type person devoting his entire life to learning to be an elite level MMA fighter - there are kids like this out there. If you don't think that such a kid can beat up an NBA player who has ZERO fighting experience, you're just ignorant af."
lmao can you even imagine zion williamson or steven adams sprinting at you with a murderous look on their face?  I'd probably die of fright.
Nah there'd be some drunk out of shape dude who thinks he can fight Zion Williamson
Is Ja Morant better than Zion Williamson?
"Also Pacquiao's team was and is involved in some of the worst shenanigans the league has ever seen. They conduct trades that are the equivalent of trading Zion Williamson for Jared Dudley, Kostas Antetokounmpo, and Devontae Cacok."
"NOLA Hornets Pelicans  PG: 07-08 Chris Paul  SG: 18-19 Jrue Holiday  SF: 02-03 Jamal Mashburn  PF: Present Day Zion Williamson  C: 17-18 Anthony Davis  Notable Omissions: Davis West, Baron Davis, Peja, Tyson Chandler, Brandon Ingram, Demarcus Cousins"
In the NBA?? We talking NBA. Zion is only the 3rd Williamson in the history or the league
"Nah. Basketball is too by-the-numbers it’s getting close to the problem baseball has with viewership growth from a product standpoint you’re going to draw more heads if there’s more of a wildcard/upset factor. I don’t agree with any need for a hard games-behind limit basketball needs more places to introduce game 7 intensity, some any given Sunday type shit.  And besides, it’d make a fantastic story if a 10 seed Zion Williamson or something just goes nuclear for 3 weeks putting up 35 ppg on like 80% shooting and just wrecks the playins and a first round opponent"
He was the consensus number 1 recruit in high school so probably a few people.   [source](https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2019/6/12/18652045/rj-barrett-zion-williamson-nba-draft-2019-recruiting-duke-highlights-aau-high-school-stats)
Most marketable has to be a factor. Zion Williamson is the most marketable
"""This is why I love MSG"" - Zion Williamson"
"Sigh....  Jay Williams, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon, Carlos Boozer, Elton Brand,  Corey Maggette, JJ Redick, Sheldon Williams, Gerald Henderson, Josh McRoberts, Jason Tatum, Austin Rivers, Jabari Parker, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Jahil Okafor, Grayson Allen  Clearly you don't understand what the word TYPICALLY means. Now you have been schooled. Enjoy the L."
"What? Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.   The golden ratio is defined by the case where two different lengths are compared, and the number calculated when dividing the sum of the two lengths by the longer of the two lengths is the same as when you divide the longer length by the shorter length.  Fine, so I misspoke - they're the same units, technically, but the numbers still refer to the measurements of two separate, dissimilar quantities.  There has to be some kind of difference between the things you're measuring, or it's not a ratio. If I'm comparing how tall I am and how tall my brother is, or how many points Steph Curry scored compared to Zion Williamson, then the term ratio doesn't apply. Ratios are never used for comparing two data points that are entirely like-for-like."
RJ Barrett...in the playoffs  Ja Morant...in the playoffs  Zion Williamson.... 🥸
He literally won rookie of the year over Zion Williamson.
"I listened to that and then listened to the Dunc'd On pod where he listed out the following reasons:  1. Zion's agency not being happy with David Griffin following they treated JJ Redick (this is my inference), who is also a client of theirs 2. He had an awesome season, but the acquisitions they brought in were all bad 3. Things he's heard behind the scenes (vague) 4. David Griffin going out of his way to say something that was completely disprovable and ridiculous as a misguided effort to prove how much he loves Zion (believe he's referring to [these comments](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31406267/zion-williamson-indefinitely-fractured-left-ring-finger)) 5. Zion's own comments about NY where he said ""Yes, I'm glad you asked me that question"" about MSG and said he loved playing there when he had only played there once before in college 6. There was a lot of hope that he would go to NY before the lottery, his friend RJ Barrett is there instead and they presumably talk about playing in NY  He ends the rant with ""I can't remember ever a young star this early on in his career batting his eyes at another market like that"".  This is all from the second most recent pod, starts about 46 minutes in."

"Emeril Lagasse, who cooked for both Kelvin Benjamin and Zion Williamson, recently appeared on The Complex Carbs Podcast to discuss his new recipe book, and he shared a Kelvin story no one had ever heard before. (Transcript here and below.)  “We finished a snack, Kelvin and I decide to go out to eat in a restaurant … and he goes, ‘I need a table for four.’ I’m like, ‘It’s just the two of us.’ I didn’t ask. I didn’t ask,” Lagasse said on the May 18 episode.  Lagasse then said that two men came up and asked if they could sit with them since there were two free seats, but Kelvin wouldn’t let them.“Kelvin said, ‘These seats are taken,’” Lagasse said to Complex. “I’m like, ‘Man, am I feeding this guy enough? He’s starting to hallucinate a little bit.’  ”Benjamin’s former trainer then added that the two men probably thought Kelvin was just being a jerk, so he finally decided to ask about the two open seats.“I said, ‘Kelvin, who are those seats filled with?’” Lagasse said. “He goes, ‘Wherever I go’ … where they say, ‘everyone tries to hide their calories,’ he goes, ‘I bring everything and all of me with me. The salty, the sweet, the umami. And those seats are for those food groups because they make me who I am.’ So, he’s talking about his alter ego, the muncher mentality.  ”Lagasse then also said that there were even snacks for the other two empty seats.  “There were snacks sitting all the way around,” he added. “And then those other two snacks, they were sitting there before he was getting ready to leave; I just kind of looked at him. There was two chicken wings. He walked out, and I ate the wings real quick. You can’t leave good chicken on the table.”"
&gt;The Knicks’ best player is a poor man’s Zion Williamson  “Tell me you’ve never watched Julius Randle without telling me you’ve never watched Julius Randle”  &gt;The Hawks’ best player is a dollar tree version of Steph Curry  “Tell me you’ve never watched Trae Young without saying you’ve never watched Trae Young.”
&gt;when their best player is a poor man’s Zion Williamson  Shut your fucking mouth
Kwame Brown and Jrue Holiday link Michael Jordan and Zion Williamson
This is awesome. Six degrees of separation between Dolph Schayes and Zion Williamson. Really fun to play with.
Julius Randle is better than Zach Lavine and Zion Williamson. And u forgot some people that I’m sure u probably just forgot about but otherwise it’s a pretty good list imo. Great job
Like DeMarcus Cousins or Zion Williamson?
"Yes. Exactly. Draymond is a once in a generation level defensive player.  Wiggins defensive rating on [111 on BBRef](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html), higher than GSW as a whole and 7th among rotation players on the team. The best case for his defense is, he's up to 21st in [DRPM on ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), a stat which has Draymond Green ranked 55, behind CJ McCullum and Zion Williamson.  His DRTG [on NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*GE*20)is around 75th for players who play more than 20 MPG.

This is like calling Zion Williamson unathletic.
Exactly. Started basketball when I was 13. I wasn’t super tall and lacked all the fundamentals. Made varsity freshman and sophomore year but got 0 minutes. I knew it wasn’t gonna work so i pivoted to football and it’s just a much easier to sport to learn and catch on as long as u got athletic gifts. I feel like you could take a Zion Williamson and make him an NFL defensive end but you can’t take a dk metcalf and make him good at basketball. There’s just too much stuff he’d need to learn.
"Zion Williamson, duh."
"There's a decent probability that Zion Williamson dunked more times in a single high school game than there have been dunks in the history of the WNBA. They can have all the basketball knowledge in the world, but the athleticism isn't there and it really isn't high level ball."
Zion Williamson would like a word about that strategy   To be fair though he had one of the lowest chances of being a bust since Lebron so he’s probably an exception
"Giannis Antetokoumpo- Winner, dominant force of nature, reminds me of David Robinson and Shaq with his ability to absolutely affect the game just with his physicality. Is on a winning team.  Luka Doncic- Young Phenom, is skilled, shifty handles and ball fakes, can make circus shots or no look passes. Clutch, and is on a up and coming team that is looking for the next price to elevate them.  Trae Young- absolutely electric player, logo threes, ankle breakers, or lobs to his big men, shifty handles and crisp passing. Is on a young team that overachieved a little bit, but should be able to continue their level of play, and will only get better.   Zion Williamson- Air Gumbo, looks like shaq bud is 6’6, can body anybody out of the way, is a insane dunker. On a bad team right now, but one that has a lot of talent, and are trying to figure it out to make the playoffs."
https://hypebeast.com/2021/7/jordan-brand-the-next-dance-uk-basketball-zion-williamson-documentary-watch
The best team I could come up with:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo
PG: Kyle Lowry   SG: James Harden   SF: Zion Williamson   PF: Cristiano Felicio  C: Nikola Jokic
Some organizations just suck at team building. It's not small market vs big market.  New Orleans: Chris Paul Anthony Davis Zion Williamson  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett Kevin Love Karl Anthony Towns  Sacramento: Boogie Cousins  Etc.
"Zion fucking Williamson, to be honest. Jrue already threw some beyond bad passes to him and he still finished those that were behind the basket"
"You're very conveniently forgetting Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson, and Bam Adebayo. Also, Towns was born in New Jersey, he could absolutely play for Team USA if he hadn't been essentially scalped at age 16 to play for the DR."
Last I read he was on the select team but then wasn't extended an offer.   https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/zion-williamson-joins-brandon-ingram-usa-basketball-olympic-finalist  I think he got snubbed just like Trae.
Gotta get Zion Williamson into the Janus Filmseverse
"r/nba during the games: we need players that can play a role, hustle, play hard and don’t need the ball in their hands.  Also r/nba: WHY THE HELL DIDN’T YOU ADD TRAE YOUNG, ZION WILLIAMSON, CHRISTIAN WOOD AND DEAARON FOX?"
Pls get Zion Williamson or Cristian Wood
1. Luka Doncic 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jayson Tatum 4. Zion Williamson 5. Paolo Banchero
1. Luka Doncic  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Zion Williamson 5. Emoni Bates
"In football I've seen it defined as a player who stays in the top 2-3 in the game for 10+ years, so Messi and Ronaldo for example. Of current NBA players, the current ""generational talents"" by that definition would be LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry.   The players coming through now? I can only really see Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson making it to that level."
Why isn’t Zion Williamson inside again?
I almost dated a girl whose friend got flown out by Mason Plumlee and whose ex played against Zion Williamson
"Tbh it is only a matter of time until we get the “[Wojnarowski] Pelicans forward Zion Williamson has requested a trade, sources say. His preferred list of destinations include the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat” notification   It’s inevitable"
Yo how the fk is Zion Williamson not on the team? is he injured?
I normally eye-roll at HOH's over the top video titles but this one was fully accurate.  Zion Williamson Absolutely HUMILIATES Kevin Knox &amp; Dunks It!
1. Nets - Kevin Durant 2. Bucks - Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Lakers - LeBron James 4. Warriors - Stephen Curry 5. Clippers - Kawhi Leonard 6. Nuggets - Nikola Jokic 7. 76ers - Joel Embiid 8. Mavericks - Luka Doncic 9. Blazers - Damian Lillard 10. Celtics - Jayson Tatum 11. Suns - Chris Paul 12. Heat - Jimmy Butler 13. Hawks - Trae Young 14. Wolves - Karl-Anthony Towns 15.

"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"

"Not sure what you’re trying to say here. I don’t know the first decade well enough to disagree on, and I agree on the Russell/ Celtics domination era, but you lose me after that The 70s were the wilderness years, it started well with Bradley &amp; Clyde Knicks, but Cocaine really hurt the league later.  The 80s is Magic &amp; Bird &amp; massive growth, but the 1981 “clarification” of zone defense ushered in the era of isolation (insane illegal defense calls).  The 90s is Jordan/Pippen Bulls domination &amp; clarity on how isolation was ruining the game.  2000-2010 is the return of fluid basketball &amp; the beginning of the 3-pt era.   2010-2020 is LeBron domination &amp; the 3-pt revolution hitting it’s stride, in large part behind Steph Curry.  This is shaping up to be a golden age as superstars are appearing all over the place. Here’s hoping Trae Young, Zion Williamson, Jamal Murray,Luka Doncic, Ja Morant, &amp; all the rest stay healthy because the NBA has never been more fun to watch than it is right now."
"Under 25:  Luka, Mitchell, Booker, Tatum, Trae, 6th Man Zion Williamson"
Damian Lillard or Zion Williamson from this list. But realistically I don't think we see any big swings this off season.
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
It's not called Zion Williamson National Park for nothing though
"Who cares, Zion Williamson eventually leaving is a guarantee. He’ll be outta there after his extension expires and maybe even before."
"You're not wrong, but how hard could it be to start writing new storylines? It's just a matter of taking what happened in the past and applying it to the present.

"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each.

The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O’Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De’Aaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who’s good and how the different titles were won.

"? What’s the point of ur argument. That he played a career high amount of game son his second season? The whole reason this thread even started is cuz u said Brandon Ingram was garbage, and now ur claiming Zion Williamson is somehow garbage. When both are like top 15 at least in the league in scoring. You really should watch the league before u talk about something you clearly don’t know anything about."

Idek how to respond to that Zion Williamson averaged 27 a game this year. Watch the league my man.
"For about 3 months. The off-season has started, and according to Lakers fans, Lillard, Zion Williamson, and Giannis should be given to the Lakers for nothing, Pau Gasol style."

"Zion is already part of the list - https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/zion-williamson-joins-brandon-ingram-usa-basketball-olympic-finalist      He was previously on the Select Team.

Not sure about LaMelo, I know there was talk about him before injury, so maybe with the injury he decided not to get involved this time.

"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."
"There is absolutely no way Zion Williamson will be a generational player, because the way his body is build will lead to his joints and cartilage getting destroyed way too fast. He will be one of the big NBA what if stories of our time"
Can Reddish has more playoff points than Zion Williamson.
"I'm sorry but honestly in what way is that not just a shitty way of framing what the right mentality actually is?  I don't want to get into any owner v. player debate because IMO team owners shouldn't even exist. Teams should be ""owned"" by their cities, but that's a tangent.  But the group of people involved in professional spectator sports that should be catered to above all is the fans. The players are paid an obscene amount of money to play their sports, I mean in terms of actual (taxable) salary, top tier pro athletes are just about the highest paid individuals on the planet. And it's not the owners who pay those salaries it's the fans. It's because hundreds of millions of people worldwide have decided that sports are their preferred method of entertainment. We're not talking about some $10/hr warehouse worker who can barely pay the bills, those are the kinds of workers who absolutely need to be far better treated. These are all multi-millionaires.  What's best for the fans should come first and foremost in the decision making process within the sports leagues. I'm not saying it should be the only thing. I'm also not saying that every star player who gets drafted to a bottom feeder should toil away for their entire career because of front office incompetence. But when 20 year old Zion Williamson starts putting out signals that he wants out, that should be looked very poorly upon because it's bad for the fans of every team except for the ones that are destination locations.  This shouldn't even be an issue in the first place because removing max salaries while imposing a much more fixed salary cap would eliminate the issue entirely. Here's an example of me not caring about what's good for the players. That would lower the salaries of the middle 1/3 of players by a decent amount, and the borderline max players by a lot, because the top superstars would be making a much higher percentage of the salary cap due to how impactful they are. If a player like Donovan Mitchel wanted to make 45+ million dollars, he would almost certainly have to stay in Utah to do so. And if he so desperately wanted to play in a big city or for a championship frontrunner, he'd likely have to take a substantial pay cut, which basically nobody ever wants to do."
The NBA needs to embrace player movement/player empowerment rather than trying to continuously protect often-incompetent small market owners.   There's just no reason someone like Zion Williamson should have to wait out \~7 years in New Orleans if he doesn't want to be there.
Donovan Mitchell -- No.  Zion Williamson -- No.  Luka Doncic -- Yes.  Nikola Jokic -- Yes.  Joel Embiid -- No.

You're a bucks fan of course yours gonna say some shit like that.  It doesn't matter where the ref was standing his job is to gtfo the way of the player.   THEY ARE LITERALLY TRAINED TO DO THAT.  Its extremely rare..   Ref was criticized for Zion Williamson finger injury this year which was bs. Had nothing to do with ref contact.  Other than rhat was 2019 nurkic injury Is the only the close to what happened tonight. And the the ref made contact after the injury.  What happened tonight is not common.
"Lakers or other playoff teams could use Steph Curry, Zion Williamson or other players"
"I think if we can be patient, we wait for a big man. Imagine if we got Zion Williamson. We wouldn't be automatic contenders now, but as they get older and the older guys phase out of their prime, they would become insane. But I know it would probably cost us one of them to acquire someone like him."
"If Cam Reddish has the potential to be an all star, literally anyone in the league can be called that. It would be a meaningless designation. Yes, he's breathing and a professional basketball player so I guess he has a theoretical chance some day.     But the odds are infinitesimal because his growth curve sucks. A few good games in your first two years mean nothing when you have a 9.03 PER rookie year, have eight months off to get better, and then put up a 9.36 PER. He is an inefficient player who actually found a way to shoot worse in his second year than his first.  And not just about anybody who actually watches him play would agree with you.   Here's The Athletic's ranking of the top 50 players on their rookie deals from February: https://theathletic.com/2375978/2021/02/25/zion-williamson-luka-doncic-trae-young-nba-young-talent-rankings-top-10/  Where is Cam Reddish listed? 46th behind ""potential"" all star Marvin Bagley Jr!  There's probably no player in NBA history who has had as two bad of seasons as Cam Reddish and made an all star team. So labeling him the way you do just shows a complete lack of perspective.  Cam Reddish will never be in the top one precent of active basketball players. Seems like so glaringly obvious of a statement but feel free to keep arguing because he was once a minus three in the supposed game of his life against one of the worst defenses in the league. That's definitely enough.   Coby White scored thirty in three straight games once and I would call anyone who said he was a potential all star a moron."
Zion Williamson is a closer comparison

What about if they made moves for this starting 5:  PG: Damian Lillard  SG: James Harden  SF: Lebron James  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Joel Embiid  Would this be a good team?
"If Bradley Beal demanded a trade to the Kings along with Kawhi Leonard and Zion Williamson they would have the best “big 3” in the West and would be favourites in the conference……nobody cares about your whiney “what ifs”. Bron got hurt and that sucks but the whole league is hurt, he’s the best player on the planet.  Just let some team have their moment without making it about the Lakers"
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they’d take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4.

"It really isn't.  I'm literally pointing out objective facts that prove that the ownership did not care about the team. Demps cared but was bad. The ownership did not care, and it's been reported time and again that they cared more about the Saints than the Pelicans. It's nothing new; these things have been reported over and over for years.  They let a shitty GM keep his job for almost a decade. That should be unacceptable for a franchise, but fans of shit franchises don't understand that. Anthony Davis was there for 7 years, and they didn't make it past the first round of the playoffs. That should also be unacceptable. He requested a trade privately, and not even to one team specifically. He just let it be known that he would not re-sign with the Celtics if traded there.  Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak ran their course with the Lakers and made a string of poor signings, so Jeanie Buss ousted her brother and brought in a new front office staff. What a fucking concept.  If the Pelicans ownership cared about their team before the AD trade request, they should have done due diligence and hired a competent GM.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NOH/draft.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NOH/draft.html) Draft picks made by Demps.  THERE ARE ALSO CURRENT/RECENT REPORTS THAT ZION WILLIAMSON AND HIS FAMILY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ORGANIZATION.  How dense are you? Of any fans who might understand lackluster ownership, you'd think it would be a Bulls fan  I am literally just pointing out reasons why AD did not like the franchise and did not believe in the ownership/front office. Why is that so hard to understand for you? If it were random, I'd be talking about a different team in a different sport to compare to the Pelicans, but I'm telling you things that actually happened and you keep saying the same thing over and over again. ItS RaNDoM"
"It's not a good comparison. Cade Cunningham is widely believed to be a lock for #1, but not everyone agrees (Sam Vecenie of the Athletic)  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don’t think we should necessarily write this in stone yet. The one thing that every person in basketball says about Troy Weaver is that he absolutely does not subscribe to group think. He said in a post-lottery presser that they’ll look at five guys and then make the best decision. It’s worth taking him at his word. After the lottery, I got texts from multiple sources that said the Pistons are also thought to be fans of Jalen Green. So look, I’m mocking Cunningham here. Pistons fans who want Cunningham shouldn’t have a meltdown based off this. But this isn’t like 2019 when Zion Williamson was a done deal and everyone in the basketball industry knew it. Cunningham is considered the likely choice here. He’s the overwhelming favorite. But everyone seems to be acting like this is unequivocally a done deal, and I’m not totally convinced of that as of right now, an hour after the lottery.  Most people have Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley at similar levels, with some adding Jonathan Kuminga to that mix. Since yesterday, Rockets fans have generally be in favor of drafting Jalen Green, followed by Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs a distant third."

"So were Trae Young and Zion Williamson and plenty of other college players. The NBA has to move on at some point, lebron and Steph still have some years left but the league will move on at some point, it always does."
I want to see Zion Williamson against these players...
No because the Pelicans have Zion Williamson
"Right now he is Zion “Empty Calories” Williamson lol  But seriously, I still think he’s going to be good but he needs an outside shot."
"I’m reading what you’re saying. He ranked second in USG% in the regular season with a TOV% of 12.2. That TOV% is in line with the players surrounding him, so at first glance it seems like he’s not that turnover prone.   However, his AST% is a mediocre 16.2 which is vastly inferior to everyone else around him. The other guys who are comparable (just skimming) are Zion Williamson, Jordan Clarkson, and Jerami Grant, and they all have slightly lower TOV%.   I mean, it goes without saying that if a player’s role is to create assists he’s going to wind up with more turnovers because he’s handling and passing the ball more frequently. So when Embiid has a similar TOV% and has the second highest USG% in the league, but he’s not being a facilitator or passing, then he’s turning it over when he shouldn’t.   You can use USG%, TOV%, and AST%, or AST/TO ratio; whichever way you slice it he’s turning the ball over at the same rate as players who *are* making risky passes to create open looks, but he’s doing so while handling the ball in isolation.   You said it yourself; it’s been a problem since his rookie year, the media asks him about it every summer, and despite some minor improvements it’s still holding him back. We don’t even need to bring stats into it to know that, but I like to because they are reference points that tell me *to what degree* of a problem it is. And based on the stats it’s a pretty major problem. It’s probably second to his durability in flaws in his player profile. Good thing he’s elite at pretty much everything else he’s asked to do."
Say my Wiz happened to get top pick every season for 5 straight seasons and having the hindsight of how players turn out…  C: James Wiseman (2020)  PF: Zion Williamson (2019)  SF: Brandon Ingram (2016)  SG: Donovan Mitchell (2017)  PG: Luka Doncic (2018)  Cause looking at what Ernie did to the team…it hurts too much to think on all the Players we missed due to horrible drafting.

"Good job, you know how to multiply percentages.  Now take a second and think about whether Terance Mann is actually as effective on offense as Zion Williamson, or if maybe there could be some sort of small sample size bias with that 42% number."
"Future SuperSonics star, Zion Williamson"
You can add the New Orleans Pelicans with Zion Williamson.
I already added the Pelicans with Zion Williamson.
I accidentally added the New Orleans Pelicans with Zion Williamson. My typing is a bit rush. Please excuse me.
Allstar Zion Williamson is the best non all star of all time imo.
"Don't get me wrong, with the right coach, offensive system and talent around Zion, he could be a top fifty NBA player ever. His athleticism reminds me of a Young Blake Griffin with an all around game of Charles Barkley. NBA fans want Williamson to be in games that matter, including NBA playoff games. His injury history for such a young man is frustrating."
Luka this season was what? Maybe a 7 game difference from arguably earning the MVP over Jokic.   This coming season you have Zion Williamson with new proven teammates and a new head coach. If his team somehow ends up top 2 in the West with him leading then he could easily win the MVP with just a little improvement on his last season numbers.
He was in the league for both Kevin Johnson and Zion Williamson.
"This rely on the jazz defensive scheme. They guard these players 1v1 Vs Golbert and that something a few teams do. And a guy like AD is great enough to cook Golbert .

Nikola Jokic averaged 24.7 points, 12.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists.   Anthony Davis averaged 24.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks.

"Far fewer national games than the Pelicans? No shit, the Pelicans have Zion Williamson. Literally no one is claiming that Lonzo is the biggest factor affecting viewership on either team.  The proper comparison isn't between the Bulls and the Pelicans. The proper comparison is between the 2021 Bulls vs 2022 Bulls and the 2021 Pels vs 2022 Pels.  The Lonzo team has the greater national TV exposure in both instances."
"Without relying on combinations of two all-time-greats;  * Ben Simmons + Chris Paul. This is mostly an excuse to get Chris Paul in a 6'11 body with good rebounding.  * Khris Middleton + Zion Williamson. Shoot from anywhere in defenders faces, Zion's touch at the rim - you'd have to bite on a pump fake, and before you land he's dunked it. Also get Zion with good defense and a bit more height.  * KAT + Steven Adams. There's better options, but it'd just change the rules for what either teams can do with picks; other team doing a pick and roll? Absolutely not. Your team runs a pick and pop? Easiest points you'll ever score."

That Zion Williamson currently plays for the New Orleans Pelicans and not the New York Knicks
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."

"Ja Morant &gt; Zion Williamson.  I get Zion's amazing gifts and realize he's a one man wrecking crew, but I have a creator bias. Because Ja can get other people going when he can't get to the rim I think that makes him more valuable to a team than Zion. You need the right players around Zion to maximize his talents where I think Morant can maximize other players talents.   Although often when I watch Zion play I think to myself ""that's a stupid opinion and you're stupid for having it"" but I'm gonna stick to it for the purpose of this thread."
Yeah man. He’s more like Charles Barkley or Zion williamson

Zion Williamson.   Went from most overrated to most underrated in a matter of months. Still confuses me how that has happened.
"The Pelicans turned one of LeBron's rejects, Brandon Ingram, immediately into an All-Star and the Most Improved Player in the league.  They turned another LeBron reject, Lonzo Ball, from a .315 three-point shooter into a .376 three-point shooter (without which Ball would have had to sign for the free-agent minimum).  And Zion Williamson has certainly blossomed very quickly into a far more well-rounded player than almost anyone else in the league expected.  The current Pelicans front office knows what they're doing."

"The first few years still matter. That's who they are as a player. Excluding seasons because they were still growing can be done for any player. Zion Williamson, for example, will probably be #1 in per 36 minutes scoring very soon. He's already higher than Michael Jordan."

"""Hey bro, just so you know - Zion Williamson will maybe leave New Orleans eventually."""
"1. Steph Curry is the most overrated player that I've seen in my lifetime (33 years old). He is the product of players not wanting to look bad on social media or in the press, therefore, he faces lighter defense than most of his peers. The direct comparison to Ray Allen is insulting, as Allen was a clutch shooter who 95% showed up for the big moment. Curry scores on open looks in garbage time but chokes away anything of importance when the time matters. He also is unable to use a mouthpiece properly.  2. Jimmy Butler is a top five player. 3. Zion Williamson is Shawn Kemp without a drinking problem. 4. Damian Lilliard's career was over the day he was drafted by the Blazers."
"Zion Williamson is overrated. His defence is garbage, and he doesn't rebound. His offense is amazing but he's talked about as if he's a superstar.  He would be hunted in the playoffs and is a completely one dimensional player."
Zion Williamson will never play for a team with over 60 wins (until he goes to a super team). He's never going to be defensively strong enough and won't be able to lead a team without another superstar
"&gt;Wing players actually shoot the ball  what is Zion Williamson then? what is Giannis?  &gt;Also it's funny seeing sixers fans try to attack me for not knowing about warriors roster construction while simultaneously using Traditional centers to compare favorably to Ben not knowing the warriors usually play Dray at center.  what are you even trying to say? Draymond worked well with both Bogut/Looney, i'm asking why wouldn't it work if you swapped Bogut/Looney with Simmons. that's the point.   he also worked very well with Shaun Livingston by the way who also was a non-shooter from 3 and didn't really provide spacing.   &gt;I did see the numbers with Bogut and Dray. Warriors were BETTER WITHOUT HIM on the floor.  brother Warriors were PLUS TWENTY with that lineup lol? also you accused me of using small sample sizes and you're using an even smaller sample size now?  the slew of evidence (14/15 and 15/16 with Bogut and Livingston, 20/21 with Looney) that Warriors in the Curry era regularly had great success even when you put someone who is also not a floor spacer with Draymond is bunk because what, the difference in +19.99 and +25? alright then.  &gt;Also you still haven't addressed anything about why Simmons is literally a negative without Embiid.  because he doesn't work well with other traditional centers whose only offensive skill is rim running. when he played with Horford without Embiid on the court Sixers were pretty good (+7). even with someone like Mike Muscala who just kinda sorta shoots they didn't get destroyed as badly (-1) and somewhat stayed afloat.  and now you're gonna say ""see Simmons + non-shooter center doesn't work"" which yes, it doesn't, but Draymond while he is a non-shooter, still is a good offensive player with other offensive skills other than being tall and jumping high + more crucially the rest of the Sixers isn't/wasn't the rest of the Warriors. obviously if the Warriors didn't have Curry (and now Klay hopefully) i wouldn't think Draymond and Simmons would work, but they do."

"i love zach lowe, but (trying not to be a homer here) the pels coverage is a bit odd in this article.  he says we moved ""down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry"". that's not true, we traded from 10 to 17, thats 7 spots. but regardless, in that deal we also moved eric bledose, who he doesnt talk about at all in the pels section. talk to anybody who watched this team last year, he was a total weight around the neck of this team, so that trade did a TON of addition by subtraction, in my view. he then says that if we improve next year ""it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram"", which could be true, but not having bledsoe or adams will absolutely help.   he also says ""The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic."" remind me which two picks we burned? we sent a lakers pick to the grizz, but the other we traded one for graham in the s&amp;t, but that one is lottery protected, after which it turns into two seconds. so if we don't make the playoffs next year, we dont trade a first rounder at all. i get zach needs to be concise, but thats fairly large context.  im totally open to calling the pelicans ""losers"" when it comes to free agency. we wanted lowry, we didnt get him, that's an L. not trying to nit pick, but i just have some issues with the context provided here."

"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Zion Williamson
&gt;	What's next? Zion Williamson working on diet and nutrition with ~~Charles Barkley.~~ sum big ole women.
"We stopped going to games because we had an incompetent front office, terrible drafting, poor free agency acquisition, and a laughably terrible coach. The organization was not offering a good product so we hit them in the wallet. Not all of us have been mediocre enough the past decade to secure top 3 picks year after year to waste the early careers of generational players like AD and Zion Williamson.   I cannot believe a Pelicans fan like you has the blind audacity to shit talk a franchise that had arguably the greatest player of all time lead them to two three-peats in 7 years. You guys have not accomplished anything to the point you deserve any respect from another fanbase. And your behavior is reinforcing that.   Know your place."

The honest answer is we wouldn’t want to risk any woman from being bulldozed by Zion Williamson on a fast break.
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
What's next?   Zion Williamson working on diet and nutrition with Charles Barkley.
"They'll be alright I'm a sixers fan and I have to admit that they are pretty much a shit run franchise as well I had to come to terms with that it didn't ruin my day.   So I guess when Zion Williamson who's represented by CAA and that means with Leon Rose in the front office of the Knicks it's probably where he's going to force a trade to they'll start to get it.   Unless his fat ass gets hurt from being 6""5 and closing in on three hundo which is a lot of weight on the joint's so I would Cross your fingers and hope nothing bad happens"
The owners of the pelicans are the same as the saints if I'm not mistaken and they don't seem to give the pelicans the same attention as their football team.  You have David Griffin and former Duke Blue devil and the only Alaskan born NBA player that I know of in the front office and David Griffin has been a part of some winning team's during his tenure with the Cleveland lebron's until the king banished him.  Now he's working for a team that reminds of the step child and is somewhat neglected from what it seems The way that Anthony Davis left because he didn't feel like that franchise was doing anything to be competitive or maybe being a small market they just couldn't be.  Then they get the number one pick what Zion Williamson and they appear to be potentially on the way to fucking that up also. The only conclusion is that it is just a shit run franchise and it's not the only one in the NBA You could make the same accusations towards the timberwolves and the king's. You saw it with the clippers for years during the Donald Sterling ownership sometimes a team is just run poorly from the top down and I think the pelicans might be one of those aforementioned shit run franchises.

"&gt; According to Kevin O’Connor of The Ringer, the Pelicans are desperate for free agent point guard Kyle Lowry with a fear of the Zion Williamson situation being the motivating factor in their plans.  Pelicans wanted Lowry, didn't get him. And they lost Lonzo."

The downside is Zion Williamson leaving when his contract is up.   Superstars make more money now on their endorsements than on supermax contracts.  Zion is going to make more leaving basketball money on the table and finding a winning situation. Plus he gets some say in where he works.
The pelicans got that  “amazing” lakers trade package AND lucked into generational talent Zion Williamson AND a top 5 draft pick that never would’ve been a top 5 draft pick had it been sent to the spurs and has yet to finish with a better record than the spurs these past 2 years. No world does trading Kawhi allow you to be title contenders again
"Not only that, Kevin Arnowitz [suggested](https://www.google.com/amp/s/tv5.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/NBADraftplayerspotlight26972005/let-zion-williamson-choose-where-wants-play-next%3fplatform=amp) that the draft should be abolished and players should choose where they want to go.   I doubt he would have been saying that if a big market had the top pick"
"No I'm not. Zion had pg duties in the half court for a good chunk of the season. He would set up plays and execute them. IE playmaking. https://www.insider.com/zion-williamson-pelicans-point-guard-offense-working-2021-2  Lonzo never really had those duties because he was relatively easy to defend off the dribble. If he was given the opportunity in the half court to start the offense it would normally be him dribbling around the 3 point line for a bit then going for a stepback 3 for no reason. It's all good, not everyone watches games though."
"Coaches: Willie Green, Mike D'Antoni  Center: Jonas Valanciunas  FC: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram  BC: Devonte Graham, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  NO Bledsoe, Adams, Lonzo  Still moves to be made too... it's looking a WHOLE lot better than last year  P.S. fuck r/nba"
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valančiūnas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
"&gt; I would rather have Thad straight up...  You're behind by about 2-3 years.  &gt;  LaVine became an efficient 27 point-per-game scorer last season on a game fueled by explosive at-rim baskets and deep 3s, yet he will now share a backcourt with DeRozan, whose midrange style is a relic of a bygone era of basketball. But DeRozan’s shot selection and playmaking also quietly evolved in his three seasons with the Spurs. Since 2018-19, DeRozan ranks third in isolation scoring efficiency among all 104 players to log at least 200 chances, according to Second Spectrum. Only Steph Curry and James Harden rank ahead of him. Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson are right behind him.  &gt; This statistic may come as a surprise, considering DeRozan’s reputation as an inefficient player. But even on the Spurs, a team without a lot of knockdown 3-point shooting on the roster, DeRozan was able to feast, getting to the basket or pulling up from midrange.  &gt; That uptick in scoring efficiency is a by-product of DeRozan’s playmaking development. He takes better shots and looks to pass far more frequently. He weaponizes the threat of his midrange jumper, snaking his way into the paint and using jabs or pump fakes to draw defenders out of position and open passing windows. He plays with a seasoning that he lacked earlier in his career, when he was making All-Star teams."
Zion Williamson for THT
So why is Simmons on his podcast talking about Zion Williamson being the first player to not take the rookie extension?
"Pelicans fans are whiny as fuck lmao. Zion Williamson was one of the most hyped prospects ever and New Orleans was in the midst of a debacle with Anthony Davis just two years ago. They have yet to make the playoffs with him on the team, unlike other teams with their young stars (Young, Doncic). There are already rumblings of Williamson and his family wanting out of New Orleans, so no shit there is gonna be a ton of pressure on the franchise.  SGA isn’t remotely close to as good as Williamson and OKC (and Minnesota) is somehow even less relevant than New Orleans."
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain – including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 – all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year – and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
"His family is apparently not happy with the Pelicans. And that's from Shams.  https://theathletic.com/2656520/2021/06/17/inside-the-end-of-stan-van-gundy-with-the-pelicans-and-an-ongoing-battle-to-keep-zion-williamson-happy/  And from what was reported about him in college, his stepfather holds an Uncle Dennis type role in his life. Well at least he did at the time. Whether he still does or will in 2 years is something we don't know."
Not while Zion Williamson is in the NBA too.
He got a taste of MSG and he's [hooked.](https://slate.com/culture/2021/04/zion-williamson-knicks-unhinged-speculation.html)
"yes we need to prove to the NBA and prospective players that we aren't a trash fire anymore and we have competent people steering the ship  i'm not gonna be like oh now we are favorites for the ECF or like now we can trade fournier for zion williamson or anything like that  but if some huge name star gets grumpy where they're at.. well harden got traded for caris lavert, jarrett allen and a bunch of picks  this makes it easier to put together a good trade package that doesn't include RJ or randle..  fournier + toppin + burks + 4 first round picks should buy you almost anyone in the league (who is available) if these are the going rates"
"""Can we have Zion Williamson?""  ""We have Zion Williamson at home, honey."""
"Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, and that new guy that just got drafted by Houston number 2."
The Knicks are probably gonna get Zion Williamson
"for Ben Simmons we just want Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Zion Williamson, Ben Simmons and 5 first rounders from the Timberwolves."
"You guys have Zion Williamson, Lonzo will play. Also you’re just gonna sign a guy who will actually be injured for 4 years."
&gt;perfect in the Jordan clarkson 6th man role  I really couldn't disagree more lol. I don't hate Oubre but he has none of the guile or wiggle that Clarkson has. Oubre isos like he thinks he is Zion Williamson... crashing into people and going for the drive. The only thing he has in common with Clarkson is not passing
"Why do you feel a need to clarify that it's ""months old quote"" when the first words of the post are ""Zion Williamson in May""?"
"In no particular order:  1.	⁠Giannis  Arguably the best player in the world today and he’s only 26. Unless he becomes riddled with injuries, it’s very unlikely we see him drop off in the next 5 years  2. Luka Doncic  Luka will be 27 and in the prime of his career. He’s already found his way into some MVP conversations at 22 and it’s not hard to imagine he’ll win the award sometime in the next 5 years.  3. Zion Williamson  The man is already averaging 27ppg in his first full season. I can easily see him improving over the next few years to become a top 5 player in the league  4. Donovan Mitchell  At 24 years old, Donovan Mitchell is already among the best guards in the league. When you look at Dame and Curry, and you compare their games from when they were 30yrs old to when they 24/25yrs old, you can see they improved a ton and really took their game to the next level. Who’s to say Donovan Mitchell won’t do the same.  5. Deandre Ayton  This ones a reach, I know, but it’s kind of boring if I make my list too safe. Don’t really have a good reason for why this would happen lol, but here’s my hot take: Booker and Ayton will start to get Kobe &amp; Shaq comparisons 5 years from now  Additional notes:  I could’ve put “someone who hasn’t been drafted yet” because there’s a great chance another Derrick rose or Luka doncic comes into the league (especially in this 2021 draft class), but I wanted to keep it to players in the league rn."

**Zion Williamson is the only player in NBA's history who's name starts with a Z**
"He was the best prospect in years.  6'4, close to 200 lbs, and the quickest player in college basketball.  In his freshman year 23.2/5.7/5.9, with 1.6 st and 1.2 blocks.  You know how rare it is to find a player that rounded at 18 years old?  Someone who can score the basketball from 3, mid range and get to the hoop?  He had excellent court vision, good feel for rebounding from the guard slot, and was a terror on defense.  He was one of the most dominant college freshman ever.  Zion Williamson had more hype than any rookie since LeBron, and his college career is basically on par with Fultz lone year.  The last player to dominate this much in a one and done freshman season besides those guys was Kevin fucking Durant, who might go down top 10 all time.  Yes, Fultz really was that good.  If you don't think so, you didn't watch him play in college and you don't pay much attention to college basketball.  Here, [watch some highlights.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usw3PHPrCUk)  He was special."
"Zion Williamson probably does want out because it's New Orleans and because the Pelicans organization is not the greatest. That being said, we'll see if he'll put his money where his mouth is when it comes time to potentially sacrifice tens of millions by rejecting an extension."
"I get this part but i just feel like young players like Zion Williamson expressing that he wants to leave his team after being in the league for 2 years is just a bad system, it makes these picks less valuable to these smaller markets."
"&gt;""Zion without a vertical""  He was called that even though he was drafted 5 years before Williamson?"
"&gt;I’d imagine the warriors can get a minimum 2 border line Allstars or 1 borderline superstar/ top tier alll star.  Who?  I mean seriously. Last year's all star teams included al to of ""borderline all-stars"" because of the number of players who dropped out. Here are the rosters:  Beal, Irving, Giannis, KD, Emiid, Jaylen Brown, Harden, Lavine, Simmons, Randle, Sabonis, Tatum, Vucevic, Curry, Doncic, LeBron, Kawhi, Jozic, Booker, Conley, Lillard, Mitchell, CP3, AD, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   Which of those players is available?   Maybe Lavine, if you make a godfather offer?  Does Lavine turn these Warriors into title contenders? Maybe Vucevic? Maybe Conley.   That's probably it.   Which of those deals get you excited? I mean, you're talking two borderline all-stars, so if the Warriors can get Lavine and Vuce ... okay, that's interesting. Does it strike you as somethign that might actually happen?"
Zion Williamson is american  KAT? This roster construction shouldn’t be dependent on Love lol
"Not sure many people have Jimmy Butler alongside Lillard and Embiid right now.  Curry + Durant on the same level as 1A, but I really can't find any names in 1A who would move down to 1B.  Kyrie should probably be at least 3A, instead of 3B.  What the fuck is this business with Zion Williamson. Lower than Draymond Green? Khris Middleton? I get he didn't play many games but jeez."
zion williamson
As of today: Zion Williamson (Pels) and Ziaire Williams (drafted by Pels and traded to Magic)
"Gray is a unique player. He looks a little overweight but it tricks the guy he’s guarding because Gray has really quick feet. He’s a great one on one defender, and he can guard every position 1-5. Though in the League it’s probably more 1-4.   He’s got really quick hands for steals. He has a nice handle and passing ability, he spent a decent amount of time running our offense. He’s excellent in transition.   A lot of people will do Draymond Green comps but he’s really a poor man’s Zion Williamson (obviously nowhere near as good, but in terms of play style). I like Gray a lot and I think he sticks in the league. He does a lot of little things well that lead to winning basketball (which is something I used to say about Terance Mann)."
I was excited about Zion Williamson and Ziaire Williams together until they told me he was already traded. Zi Williams x2 for the win
What if this is part of a ruse by Memphis to try and make the Pelicans send Zion Williamson by mistake?
"Grizzlies GM, ""Get me Zion Williamson""  Assistant- "" Sir he was already drafted by the Pelicans""  Grizzlies, "" I said get me that guy who's first name starts with Z and last name starts with W!!"""
"Zion Williamson is a Goomba. He literally looks exactly like the ones from the original Mario movie in his college basketball portrait, creepy ass ear to ear smile and weird head shape."
OP is mocking this statement in that post  &gt; Personally I don’t get all the hype surrounding Zion Williamson and in my head he’s Charles Barkley with hops.
"In the age of social media you can be just as marketable in a small market as you can in a big market, so no, he’s not losing any star power or money. He’s Zion fucking Williamson. It doesn’t matter  if he’s in New York or an underground bunker in South Dakota, he’s going to get his endorsements"
We now live in a timeline where David Griffin attempted to use his powers of seductive piano playing to serenade Zion Williamson
"So Zion Williamson, the guy who will basically only train with his stepdad during the offseason and the guy who refuses to let anyone but his momma control his diet says he didn’t like the way our medical staff didn’t rush him back from a major injury before his career even started?  Lol.    Ngl Zion is a beast on the court, but he hasn’t transitioned well into the “professional” part of being a professional athlete. The dude struggles to stay in shape, yet still has his mom cook all his meals instead of a professional chef/dietician. He works out mostly alone during the offseasons with his stepdad as his trainer.   BI has been hosting workouts practically all offseason in various locations, which have been well attended by most of the pelicans young core. Zion hasn’t shown up to any of those though."
"Davis can still win an MVP within these next 4 seasons. He is only 28 years old.  Unless he regresses offensively and his numbers look like they did last season, then he's screwed. If AD doesn't do something, then he is looking like the 7th best power forward of all time. He could even drop down to 8th or 10th depending on how Zion Williamson continues to develop and who else comes into the league.  AD needs to show his dominance if he wants to be in the conversation with Giannis. Otherwise, the 7 years he spent in New Orleans will mean little to nothing."
"This argument has never made since because I’m saying MPJ’s season in ‘21 is better if you were to compare them to any one of those Klay’s season from those years. But regardless, the starting argument is extremely bad. Zion Williamson just became a starter and he is a significantly better offense player to Klay lol  Porter averages 2 less points while taking 8 less shots. The efficiency gap is huge"
"Forreal. I don't even know what a Zionist is lol. Someone worshiping Zion Williamson, I'm assuming?  /s"

"Hard to know for sure, but for what it’s worth, here are some relevant quotes from the athletic.  Pelicans beat writer’s response to the question “Why wasn't Van Gundy a good fit?”  &gt; Van Gundy was hired to change the culture in New Orleans and bring a new mindset focused on accountability and defensive tenacity to a young and upcoming group. He ended up failing on both fronts. The Pelicans finished 23rd in defensive rating after Van Gundy's first season, and there were stretches when they looked absolutely lost on that end. A huge part of it was Van Gundy's inability to get Williamson and Brandon Ingram to fully buy in on that end. The players weren't fond of his coaching style and it was only a matter of time before things went sour.   Same writer on the top priorities for a new coach:  &gt; There has to be work done to mend fences with Williamson and Ingram. They weren't thrilled with the Van Gundy experience, and keeping them happy has to be the No. 1 priority for New Orleans  There was also an article written jointly by Shams, that same beat writer, and one other writer. Relevant quotes on Ingram and Zion(‘s family) -  &gt; Sources indicated that Brandon Ingram, an All-Star under Gentry, was not a fan of Van Gundy’s coaching style. Ingram openly talked about the way Van Gundy used Williamson and him in certain offensive sets and how they rarely worked together to get each other easier looks.  &gt; for most of this season, certain Williamson family members voiced displeasure with the organization. Among the targets of their criticism was Van Gundy, who they felt was too rigid and demanding as head coach, but also with the organization, which they claim did not live up to what they felt should be the standard for a star like Williamson. Numerous opposing league executives had heard the complaints, and they were confirmed by Pelicans officials."

"&gt;Zion Williamson on offseason bulk: “It’s part of me getting hungrier; my body is just starting to change, as well as putting the food in.”"
"many would be .  I would not be personally bc there are examples of players today that have improved their 3 point % drastically . From below average to above average. And they have less work ethic as MJ.  So for those reasons , I just couldn’t be surprised.   i.e., Al Horford &amp; LaMarcus Aldridge.  We are also discussing once in generation type player. If Zion Williamson were to become an elite 3 point shooter , I would be more than surprised. I’d be shocked."
"Magic Johnson got nicknamed ""Tragic"" after a bad playoff run in the early 80's.  Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  The Brooklyn Nets called the Brooklyn Nuts after we got Kyrie.  Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  Zion Williamson ""Snorlax.""  Kawhi Leonard was ""Wi-Fi"" because he was amazing but he would cut out on you whenever he felt like it.  Someone called Lamelo Ball ""LMAO Ball"" when he looked like he might bust but Lamelo escaped that fate.  The Lakers were the Los Angeles Flakers after the 2004 loss.  Andrew Wiggins was ""Adrian"" because despite being 6'8"" with a 44"" vertical his most famous Youtube clip was a prankster asking him if he was Asian and he thought the guy said Adrian."

"It was discussed that it was Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Salary + Picks (#14, #16, and the super-valuable-before-Ja Memphis pick) to bring AD in to play with Kyrie, Smart, Horford, and Hayward. That was unequivocally off the table once Davis had his fucking dad come out to bat against Boston.   NOLA wanted Tatum over any other player at the time.   Celtics could have easily beaten the Lakers offer by a significant gap. There was just no longer a bidding war because Davis was just going to leave in FA because the Lakers could have just cut cap space the next season and sign him outright.   Side note: KD sign+trade for Hayward was the next logical move the following season when KD wanted to come team up with Kyrie.   Think of a Jrue Holliday, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, and Robert Williams Pelicans core and a Kyrie, Smart, KD, AD, and Horford + ring chasers Celtics.   Makes me feel dirty as a Celtics fan but wouldn't it have been better for basketball? Pelicans drafted a potentially generational player and still couldn't build a competitive team with that Lakers roster."
"https://houseofstrauss.substack.com/p/the-fleshy-part-of-the-thigh  Agents and media talent and ESPN are tied at the hip, basically  ‘Even if I don’t take it as seriously as malfeasance in our politics or financial institutions, sports corruption still has an impact on coverage, and I dislike how much of the game behind the game is shielded from readers. For example, Creative Artists Agency (CAA) happens to represent key media personalities at ESPN NBA, which was by design, and accomplished with the subtlety and tact of the Red Wedding. When you combine that nugget with knowledge of CAA’s influence over the New York Knicks (GM Leon Rose is a former CAA superagent, coach Tom Thibodeau is a CAA client), ESPN’s reports of Zion Williamson (CAA client) having an interest in joining the Knicks gets put in a different light. The way it’s presented to the consumer is the mere reporting on a rising star in New Orleans wanting to play in New York. You’re not supposed to know that ESPN wants this to happen because ESPN is CAA and CAA is ESPN, which means that CAA is the Knicks, meaning that the Knicks are ESPN. You’re not supposed to know that this factors heavily into why New Orleans is shit out of luck, gumbo and jazz music be damned. In many ways, the agencies run the NBA. The media that they use to execute their messaging is making the principals seem peripheral. So often, the story of a trade or free agency signing is told absent mention of its true author. ‘"
"This is postseason inclusive. As others mentioned, excluding postseason you'll come away with Elijah Bryant as the leader.

From what I can find:  3 players are tied with a career low of 7 points.  These players are:  **Zion Williamson**  **Alex Groza**  **Oliver Lafayette**
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
Zion Williamson.  Prove me wrong
Like this? https://www.ebay.com/itm/PSA-MINT-9-Zion-Williamson-/265291969231?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;_trksid=p2349624.m46890.l49286&amp;mkrid=711-127632-2357-0
If a guy cant even play well in garbage minutes how is he expected to do well? This isn't Zion Williamson he has many glaring issues and a lack of effort when given the chance he is on one year minimum contracts because no other team sees value on him at the least we are giving him a chance to prove himself. Jokic first season he played a lot of garbage minutes and now look where he is
Zion Williamson nearest comp: Elton Brand.  Oof.
"It’s definitely not zero. He’s a superstar who wants a big city and doesn’t like it here. He’ll make more through endorsements than NBA paychecks over his career anyway.   [This article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/hoopshype.com/lists/nba-free-agency-superstars-qualifying-offer-zion-williamson/amp/) says that he’ll have to believably be willing to give up $63.5M in potential career earnings, but gain full control and unrestricted FA. If he can just act like he’s willing to do that, we’ll have to trade or lose one of the most valuable assets in all of sports for nothing.   He has too much leverage over us and we’ll have to listen to his threat and trade. Even if it’s just like 20% believable, we can’t take that risk. Just like OP, this is a car crash in slow motion."
"I think my personal definition of a generational talent takes into account how improbable it would be for a player's career arc or features of said career to be duplicated, in both play style and accomplishment. That player would likely bring something significant to the game so unique that when they decide to leave the game it may very well leave with them. It may be something as tangible as a played's shooting (Ray Allen) or as nuanced as their blend of intensity and ability (Kevin Garnett)  Players Currently in the NBA that I would consider generational:  James Durant Curry Antetokounmpo Anthony Harden Paul Westbrook Leonard Doncic Irving Jokic Lillard  I see Zion Williamson as most likely to join this class."
His teammates say otherwise but you just watched The Last Dance and decided hey this guy totally sucks     Is Zion Williamson a bad teammate because he's beginning to get sick and tired of the Pelicans?
"I'll give you one Ben Simmons for one Damien Lillard, one Kevin Durant, and one zion Williamson."
Elgin Baylor   Wilt Chamberlain   Oscar Robertson   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   Bill Walton  David Robinson   Shaquille O’Neal   Tim Duncan   LeBron James   Anthony Davis   Zion Williamson   ————————-  All of these prospects had a floor of being an All-Star
One of the hardest laughs I’ve had in this forum is looking at the post history of some 12 year old opining “Wilt sucked!” and finding he’s a Zion Williamson stan.   I mean...that’s this sub in a nutshell.
"https://houseofstrauss.substack.com/p/the-fleshy-part-of-the-thigh  &gt; Creative Artists Agency (CAA) happens to represent key media personalities at ESPN NBA, which was by design, and accomplished with the subtlety and tact of the Red Wedding. When you combine that nugget with knowledge of CAA’s influence over the New York Knicks (GM Leon Rose is a former CAA superagent, coach Tom Thibodeau is a CAA client), ESPN’s reports of Zion Williamson (CAA client) having an interest in joining the Knicks gets put in a different light. The way it’s presented to the consumer is the mere reporting on a rising star in New Orleans wanting to play in New York. You’re not supposed to know that ESPN wants this to happen because ESPN is CAA and CAA is ESPN, which means that CAA is the Knicks, meaning that the Knicks are ESPN. You’re not supposed to know that this factors heavily into why New Orleans is shit out of luck, gumbo and jazz music be damned. In many ways, the agencies run the NBA. The media that they use to execute their messaging is making the principals seem peripheral. So often, the story of a trade or free agency signing is told absent mention of its true author."
"Ethan Strauss talks about this in an article on his new substack - lots of media guys are represented by agents that also represent big name players.   Example he gives: CAA, a much bigger player than Klutch, represents Zion Williamson. One of CAAs higher-ups is Leon Rose, now president of the Knicks.   Guess who else CAA represents? Steven A Smith, Kellerman, Skip.  Argument basically is that a lot f times ""Player X wants Y"" rumors are orchestrations of agencies with influence on said player, the team AND the talking heads."
"That one premiered right after the Ghislaine Maxwell, Zion Williamson, Joey Chestnut, Honey Boo Boo and Mark McGrath from Sugar Ray episode."
"Eric Paschall and Zion Williamson (I guess Paschall shoots a bit more than Zion, to be fair)."

The league tried to rig the draft so the Knicks would draft Zion Williamson but messed it up and the pelicans ended up getting him.  And now they're trying to set up a way for Williamson to request to be traded without it seeming like he's a jerk
"Dividing WS simply by years is rather blunt. Really distorts the performance of players who missed time due to injury.  For example, Zion Williamson has played 85 total games and amassed 10.6 Win Shares. In other words, he has 10.2 WS per 82 games played - far above the 5.3 you credit him with (and which would rank him second on your list)."
Zion Williamson is the youngest MVP in league history
"Barrett is an all star, Knicks trade for Zion Williamson and Donovan Mitchell"
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
Zion Williamson and his 27 points on 61% from the field. Watch out he’s going to be even crazier this year
"The Pelicans wanted Lowry for veteran leadership. How does Lonzo Ball help with that?  By the way, going from Ball to Nickeil Alexander-Walker is a massive upgrade for the Pels. And especially for Zion Williamson, who has a much higher on/off RTG with Alexander-Walker than with Ball."
Zion Williamson
The original Zion Williamson!
Zion Williamson.
"LeBron will still be a top 20 player in 5 years (age 41-42 season)  Devonte' Graham will average close to 10 assists and shoot over 40% on very high volume from deep playing next to Zion Williamson.  Ben Simmons figures it out on his next team, and averages 23/8/8 whenever he's traded.  Kyrie Irving signs his 4 year extension with the Nets, but randomly decides to retire 1 or 2 years into it.  As a result of his 1-year showcase contract with the Lakers, Malik Monk manages to cash in a 4 year deal around $80M next summer."
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Zion Williamson  Trae Young  NEXT 5:  Jayson Tatum  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid  Kevin Durant  James Harden
"Yeah and also he’s said this stuff himself, it wasn’t just “sources say Zion Williamson loves New York”:  “New York is the Mecca of basketball. I love playing here,” a smiling Zion told reporters. “I played here in college and this is my first time playing here in the pros. And this atmosphere, whether they’re cheering or booing for you, it’s amazing. Outside of New Orleans, obviously, this might be my favorite place to play.”  CAA or not, it sounds like the guy might just like New York."
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9. LaMelo Ball  10. Cade Cunningham   11. Devin Booker  12. Bam Adebayo  13. Zion Williamson  14. Michael Porter Jr.  15. Jalen Suggs  16. Jalen Green  17. Darius Garland  18. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  19. DeAndre Ayton  20. Brandon Ingram
Even NBA 2k is on that NBA grooming gang thing. Zion Williamson already an 89. That's just ridiculous.The guy can't keep himself healthy. He's a 6'6 Oden who's good for a brief period of time. Load management is his future if he doesn't lose weight.
Nominating ZION WILLIAMSON. Just caus he missed the playoffs doesn’t mean y’all can disrespect him like this.
But we have Zion Williamson…
"I mean, it makes more sense when you look at the full quote, which I guess didn't fit in the title.  &gt; For example, Creative Arts Agency (CAA) happens to represent key media personalities at ESPN NBA, which was by design, and accomplished with the subtlety and tact of the Red Wedding. When you combine that nugget with knowledge of CAA’s influence over the New York Knicks (GM Leon Rose is a former CAA superagent, coach Tom Thibodeau is a CAA client), ESPN’s reports of Zion Williamson (CAA client) having an interest in joining the Knicks gets put in a different light.  This is essentially similar to what Klutch does, which many people seem to acknowledge at this point, so idk why this would be considered some crazy conspiracy."
Zion Williamson becomes the youngest MVP in league history
"If you had to build a squad from scratch, with a view towards competing over the next decade, would you prefer to build around Trae Young or Zion Williamson?"
"Zion Williamson will sign with the Atlanta Hawks. I firmly believe he wanted to be drafted by them and play with Trae Young, and would fit amazingly into their lineup."
"My definition of excellent handles, footwork and touch for a guy near 7ft is KD level. For a behemoth human being around the paint, it's Zion Williamson. The guy is near 300 and has the feathery touch no matter the angle like he is Tony Parker, sometimes legit moves like a ballerina out there. There is poor, below average, average, really good and then excellent."
They probably didn't wanna give him the $20+ million contract thinking that it'd hamper their ability to build a truly elite team later on to keep Zion Williamson.
"[Kosel] Walked into today’s media post-practice session to see Zion Williamson eating sliders and some other light snack work. Willie Green said Z’s not going full throttle yet, but remains on schedule for next set of buffets, either later this week or next."

"But Ball wasn't really any bigger of a prospect than Wiseman, perhaps even rated lower than Wiseman on average. So that comparison makes no sense. When you have a need and there are 2 prospects with about even outlook, you take the one who might can help you right away. It's not the same as if they passed up Zion Williamson or LeBron for a positional need"

"Hmm... So is Zion the new ""Round Mound of Rebound""?  **Zion Williamson Reportedly Having 'Weight Issues’**   The New Orleans Pelicans are keeping an eye on Zion Williamson. According to Bleacher Report, Williamson is dealing with ""weight issues"" as the 2021-2022 NBA season begins. He has reportedly reached north of 300 pounds, which is similar to his weight in the months leading up to his rookie debut.       ""These are the injuries you have to be the most concerned about, a foot injury for a guy with noted weight issues,"" one Western Conference executive told Bleacher Report. Along with Williamson's weight, he's dealing with a foot injury and will not appear in the Pelicans' season opener against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday. Williamson suffered a broken right foot during the summer. He injured the foot early in the offseason prior to summer league, and underwent surgery shortly thereafter to repair a fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot. Earlier in this year, Williamson talked about his health.       ""I do think there is another gear that I can reach regarding my weight and conditioning,"" Williamson told The Old Man &amp; the Three podcast in March. ""But I think it's like you said, it's finding it. Because I don't want to get to a spot where I'm like, 'Yeah I lost a lot of weight, but I don't feel strong. I can't do certain things I would do before.' I think it's just finding it. I do think there is another gear I can reach regarding both weight and conditioning."""
Guess some people were at a party and saw Zion just eating out of a dumpster down the alley. They looked at him and were like “dude I don’t know if you’re supposed to be eating out of there.” He kind of leans back and looks at them and just goes “I’m Zion fucking Williamson.” And keeps eating.

"Williamson's contract ends in the 2023-2024 season.  It is absolutely believable that any career could end by 2025 due to injury.  A BMI near the top of all major athletes in any major American sport only makes it that much more likely.  Williamson is literally the heaviest player in the NBA right now, beating at 7'4"" Boban's 291 lb listed weight.  Such an unprecedented physique should bring unprecedented medical scrutiny.  A BMI over 25 is considered to triple to risks of knee injury, and Zion is far over that."

Looking at all +24ppg scorers ≤25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up.

Zion Williamson will be a starter throughout his career since his playstyle is very injury-prone and he will suffer the same career as Jabari Parker.
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"

Zion Williamson
They give injury information only for players already currently injured. That Anthony Davis is projected to play significantly fewer minutes than Zion Williamson is largely hidden unless you dig into individual player projections.
Zion Williamson was injured.
"Zion ""Chunky"" Williamson"
"Zion Williamson *OUT*  Broken Jaw  Cause : Challenged to put 8 whole hard-boiled eggs in his mouth. Made it to 5. Pretty impressive, all things considered."
Zion Williamson (food) will be re-evaluated in two weeks
"[17 days ago:] (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32291955/pelicans-zion-williamson-underwent-offseason-surgery-broken-foot-ready-season)    &gt;""He had a fractured right foot that was repaired surgically,"" Griffin said.

"It would have to be something like Luka Doncic and Zion Williamson. In other words, it would never happen."
"Zion Williamson has been very reluctant to take advice from Pelicans head trainer Aaron Nelson. The same trainer from the Suns who changed Nash, Hill, Shaq, and more’s careers. He doesn’t take nutritional advice from the Pelicans. Doesn’t get a personal chef or follow team’s nutrition advice. And he trains with step dad during the summer— not the team. He’s also, now repeatedly, asked the Pelicans to hide and lie about injuries he’s had in the past to avoid taking a hit to his image."
When did he get cleared to run? A few days ago they said he wasn’t cleared for running.    https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/pelicans-zion-williamson-sent-for-scans/amp/
Zion week to week Williamson is back in full force again.
Zion Williamson carries much more weight (including a lot of fat) than bodybuilders and most NFL players because he is consuming more calories on average than his body exerts on average. It is not speculation to attribute that to a diet of heavy calorie intake. It would be purely speculative to attribute it to some unbelievably anomalous metabolic condition that continually packs on weight while also maintaining proper bodily function without the proper input (surplus calories).
Zion “Two Beignets” Williamson
"Pre-injury, I would have said Boogie Cousins…now maybe Joel Embiid? Zion Williamson is kinda like a mini Shaq and obviously Giannis is like the forward version of Shaq. But since Boogie fell from grace I haven’t seen anybody who really reminded me too much of Shaq as a whole"
"Zion ""Big Toddler"" Williamson"

"It's Zion ""Jumbo Gumbo"" Williamson"
Keep an eye on Zion Williamson. He is from NC but plays for New Orleans. I think he might one day end up playing for the Hornets.
You mean Zion “Big Apple” Williamson?
Not if there’s anything Zion “Big Gumbo” Williamson has to say about it!
"[Walden] Zion Williamson said that Kelvin Benjamin got him involved with buffets this summer. Told him it would add pounds to his thighs. ""I'm really feeling it."""
"I’m kind of on the Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Zion Williamson train right now. They’re old school lefty power forwards who feast in the paint each in their own ways. It’s refreshing to see today."
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"Well, *Skip Bayless* believes that **ZION WILLIAMSON** should make the Top 75 list.   There. My headline gets more clicks.  That's how this works, right?"

Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."

Using SI's rankings which has Ben at 21:  PG Jamal Murray  SG Donovan Mitchell  SF Khris Middleton  PF Ben Simmons  C Zion Williamson  **Bench**  Russell Westbrook  Kyle Lowry  Trae Young  Jaylen Brown  Brandon Ingram  Nikola Vucevic  Kristaps Porzingis
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Zion Williamson says Kelvin Benjamin, a fellow buffet goer, used to try to recruit him to the buffet during games. Says Benjamin would look at him between free throws and say, “Come eat.”"
Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.
If you’re going young I’d say Zion Williamson. If you’re going worse vet I’d be really interested in seeing a team built around a healthy Klay Thompson.
"[http://instreetclothes.com/2021/09/27/understanding-zion-williamsons-foot-fracture/](http://instreetclothes.com/2021/09/27/understanding-zion-williamsons-foot-fracture/)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;However, there may be multiple reasons for optimism surrounding Zion. To start, a 2016 study revealed NBA players to suffer Jones fractures did not display a decrease in performance when they returned to play. Furthermore, Aaron Nelson and the Pelicans medical staff have had a positive impact on player health since joining New Orleans, including last season when they finished in the top 10 for fewest games lost to injury or illness. Nelson also has prior success managing fifth metatarsal fractures. In 2009 while leading the well-respected Suns medical team, Nelson and his team worked Robin Lopez back from surgery to fix a fifth metatarsal fracture in just 52 days. Lopez never exhibited any associated setbacks or complications. The variables in the two cases may vary but Williamson is in proven hands."

Zion Williamson can spend more time on cardio and less time working on free throws.
"[Katz] Zion Williamson not happy with the cooking tonight: ""I’m gonna take a look at the flan, but there was a big discrepancy in calories. I can tell you that…I don’t care how the dish is cooked. You can make it delicious. You can make it presentable, but you gotta make it filling."""
"Zion Williamson buffet update: Pelicans star food critic cleared to go 100 percent, ate first 18 plates at Golden Corral"
"Adams was on a two year deal, and JV had a year remaining with a desire to be extended (NO gave him two more years). The Grizz are thought to planning to eventually move Jaren Jackson Jr. to the starting center.  Currently the point is to move more of the frontcourt offensive load to Jackson. Adams was supposed to provide defense and rebounding, and some protection for Jackson. In exchange for taking Adams and Eric Bledsoe, the Grizz moved up seven slots in this year’s draft, publicly saying they had intel that their target Ziaire Williams would be drafted before their pick. They also received the Lakers 2022 first round pick.   Eric Bledsoe lead to a domino effect of trades.   JV was a fan favorite in Memphis, but the org had no long term plans for him (just as they have none with Adams). JV played most of last season without Jackson, just like so far he’s been playing without Zion Williamson.   The true measure of the trade isn’t now; neither team was in the championship hunt. The measure for the Grizz will be years from now and how Williams does and what happens with that Lakers pick. One of the key rotation players for the Grizz, Desmond Bane was the 30th pick in the 2020 draft."
Probably won't start seeing a major decline until 30 or 31. Barring injuries of course.  Conditioning is always and important part for all athletes. Morant will have to make sure he is taking care of himself at all times.  At least he isn't Zion Williamson. That dude won't be able to sustain his weight for long. Those knees are going to clamp sooner or later.
[Highlight] Zion Williamson pulls a Kelvin Benjamin on the Golden Corral buffet
"\[Johnson\] Asked Kelvin Benjamin if he can put into words his bond with Zion Williamson. He said he couldn't. Then he did, eloquently: “If my mom had another son, it'd be Zion.

"“You know, 10-11, I mean, we could go on a 10 fried catfish po boys eating streak, 12 fried oyster po boys eating streak, now the narrative is different,” Zion Williamson said after Friday’s po boy run. “You know, 10 shrimp po boys eating streak, we’re 20-11.

"The Lakers will have approximately two bad years and then in 2025 they'll be, like, Zion Williamson, Kawhi Leonard, and Jayson Tatum. The fans won't complain. They will just be like ""see, people always want to come to LA."" And they will be right."
"Zion Williamson is complex person he dunks Beignets in poweder sugar, or syrup."
"Zion Williamson stayed after his postgame presser to say Happу Thanksgiving to everyone and asked every single person in the room what their favorite fооd for Thanksgiving is, then added that item to the list of dishes he plans to eat this summer. What a hungry guy."

"Zion Williamson is at the trough 5:00AM to 5:00PM and is going “full boar.”  His stomach is emitting sound, with sickening effects.  Right now is about building mass and fat tissue.  There is no target weight for his bulking.”"
"[Glasspiegel] Zion Williamson: ""A voice from behind me says, ‘Bоy that popcorn smells good.’ I turn around to say ‘Yeah it smells awesome.’ I turn around and it’s Jоdie Foster… I absolutely choked, I am not joking, I turned around, said ‘Yeahhh,’ and then sprint through the gate and back to my gumbo.”"
Zion Williamson had the potential to be the next superstar at the popularity level of LeBron James.  Him getting drafted to the Pelicans was the WORST thing to happen to his career/legacy  Even if he leaves and becomes an MVP that once in a lifetime hype is gone

"24 year old Lebron in the NFL would absolutely have been an NFL Tight End.  That claim is exclusive to Lebron, Idk who is arguing leonard but he doesnt have the top end speed, top end strength or top end durability.  Zion Williamson could probably be a DT barring injuries.  There arent that many athletes like that but there are a few nfl players who could have made the switch as well."
"[Beard] When Zion Williamson was charging toward the gumbo, it was Kelvin Benjamin who tried three times to put himself between Williamson and the gumbo. I asked him what he was thinking. His response: ""I'm trying to stop him from maybe getting all of the gumbo ... I don't know."""

"Dawg this is nuts. Having a former MVP isn’t enough help? Harden has been quoted when asked by reporters what do teams do when him &amp; KD are on fire “Pray”. This is why I don’t rock with the media. KD has always been a media darling because he was connected with CAA to start off his career then stayed with CAA when he signed with Roc Nation because CAA owns Roc Nation. He then left Roc Nation and took his agent that represented him there (Rich Kleinman) with him but still kept his connection to CAA. You wanna know why I’m bringing up CAA in this discussion? Stephen A Smith is represented by CAA &amp; about 90% of ESPN analysts are. It’s why ESPN constantly saves face KD. It’s also the same reason why Stephen A is always pushing another CAA client in Zion Williamson to leave New Orleans to go to the Knicks, a team that has a President who is a CAA agent in Leon Rose. The NBA media is full of narratives because of agency corporations man."

People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Article text:  &gt; The fitness experts and dietitians scattered about Capital One Arena, who came to watch an NBA game Monday evening, noticed a prospective client sitting near the end of the New Orleans Pelicans’ sideline. They desperately wanted his attention. &gt;  &gt; “Zion!” a man in Section 120 screamed during a quiet moment in the third quarter. “Stand up; get some exercise!” &gt;  &gt; The man laughed at his own joke, then, satisfied, took a swig from his plastic cup filled with a dark-colored drink. &gt;  &gt; Then, just before the start of the final quarter, a group of young adult males choreographed their own version of a weight-loss intervention for the 2019 No. 1 draft pick. The three or four men stood up and chanted in unison over and over: “ZI-ON’S CHUN-KY!” &gt;  &gt; They sat down, giggling. &gt;  &gt; Zion Williamson never turned around and acknowledged either the advice or scorn screamed within earshot. He remained on the padded seat, and his gaze stayed on the court. Williamson, a large human being listed at 6-foot-6 and 284 pounds, didn’t log a single minute of action during the Washington Wizards’ comeback win over his Pelicans. Still, for some, his presence served as entertainment. &gt;  &gt; After teaming up for two titles, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are thriving apart &gt;  &gt; Throughout this first month of the NBA season, while Williamson remains on the sideline rehabilitating from foot surgery, obsessing over and laughing at his appearance have become fair game within the league. &gt;  &gt; It’s no longer considered appropriate or acceptable to empty out our darkest thoughts and publicly aim them at athletes. Jeers about gender or race are rarely tolerated (even in Salt Lake City), and directing crude language at an athlete can get a fan banned from an NBA arena. But somehow, lost in this progress, fat-shaming is still okay in sports discussion — as long as the target is male and wealthy. &gt;  &gt; It’s okay when New York Knicks legend and color commentator Walt Frazier points out to the viewing audience how Zion has picked up some weight and needs to lose it, because he’s just being real. And it’s funny when TNT’s “Inside the NBA” crew cues up Charles Barkley for a scripted roast about Zion’s size because on the other side of the set Shaquille O’Neal melts into laughter. &gt;  &gt; It’s generally accepted that we need to respect an athlete’s mental health, so why is it still open season for fat jokes? &gt;  &gt; Trust that women and their bodies still face an unhealthy amount of scrutiny. But the difference between a sports commentator who would dare mention a woman’s weight in a derogatory manner and one who would spotlight an overweight male athlete is stark. Last year, a broadcaster’s comments about a female runner’s body type drew rebuke. And the WNBA takes protecting women’s bodies so seriously, this past season the league issued a fine and suspended Connecticut Sun Coach Curt Miller for one game for making disparaging comments about the weight of Liz Cambage, the Las Vegas Aces’ star center. &gt;  &gt; But the ceaseless comments about Williamson’s size are echoed in front of national television audiences. And there’s an even greater din of noise on social media, where anyone with two thumbs and an opinion can be a licensed nutritionist. &gt;  &gt; I should’ve known the moment I sent the tweet that it was a mistake. &gt;  &gt; From my baseline seat Monday night, I had a clear view of Williamson. He was arrayed in the look of stylish autumn — a coffee-colored down vest over a lighter brown hoodie, matched with green camo pants. I snapped a photo and tweeted how Williamson was dressed appropriately for the eternally frigid Capital One Arena. &gt;  &gt; Within a few minutes, someone commented that Williamson looked like the Michelin Man. Such a predictable response falls in line with other unimaginative takes and inquiries from fans. &gt;  &gt; Will Guillory, who covers the Pelicans for the Athletic, told me he has received the same question from fans every day. How much does Zion weigh? But Pelicans fans aren’t the only ones obsessed about the scale. As Guillory sat on press row, he said, a Wizards fan leaned in and asked him,** “Why is Zion so chunky?”** &gt;  &gt; Zion has said he needs to reach another gear in his conditioning and weight, but he also has acknowledged that as a youth he once gained 100 pounds in less than two years. The natural and intense ways in which he gains weight and strength — a team executive once bragged how Zion put on eight pounds of muscle after one week of workouts — are what make him different from the average NBA player. &gt;  &gt; But Williamson, 21, has not done himself many favors. It doesn’t help that he is featured in a commercial lounging, playing video games and endorsing a sugary drink. As a highly paid professional athlete and a rising star of the league who also appears in the NBA 75th-anniversary spot shattering a backboard, Williamson has a responsibility to his franchise — and himself — to get into shape and maintain his fitness to ensure a career of longevity. But oversimplifying his appearance as a sign of laziness or lack of self-control does not take into account the emotional, mental and genetic reasons some people pack on the pounds. &gt;  &gt; If Zion needs months to rehabilitate and get into shape, then it’s fair game to examine his motivations as a professional athlete. But too many of his critics have wielded meanness as their message. Theirs isn’t constructive criticism — just another shameful example that, for some sports fans, landing a joke is more important than delivering respect."

[Haynes] Yahoo Sources: Pelicans sharp cheddar and crackers consumer Zion Williamson has changed diets and is now eating shrimp gumbo with chef Diana Day of Butter and Salt LLC.
"[Lopez] The Pelicans announce Zion Williamson has been cleared to participate in eating drills beginning with 1-on-1 meals. His next update will be on Nov. 24, which will determine if he can be available for full team meals."
Can we get a Zion Williamson weight tracker? He's 405 lbs right now?
"No offense to Zion. He’s incredible. But Ingram’s the guy right now. Maybe he doesn’t have the long-term upside that Zion does, but Zion’s still an experiment. If the Pels FO was smart, they’d build around Ingram in the short-term, so in 22-23 they can be a genuinely competitive team that plays to Ingram’s skills that also happens to have a scoring tank named Zion Williamson."
[Medina] Zion Williamson has eaten enough. He heads to the locker room while the Bulls have leftover double stuft Oreos and has already consumed over half his body weight with 5:18 left
Kelvin Benjamin had seen enough.  He heads to the bathroom while Zion Williamson has a 114-88 pizza eaten slice lead over him with 5.18 pizzas left.
"Play was already stopped. It was a dead ball.  If this scenario happened in the middle of a transition play then, no, the ref would not have stopped live game. (See Zion Williamson losing his shoe all the damn time last season in transition)"
It all went down when they drafted fat Williamson and fired Gentry because fat Williamson couldn’t play like he did in college while staying healthy….. Gentry at least saw this and kept Zion from jumping too much
Windhorst is just mad at the Pelicans because Zion Williamson cut him in line at cracker barrel.
"Windhorst: ""Zion Williamson had a chicken gumbo stew and three all beef enchiladas. Now he's out there looking for meals like a chicken gumbo stew and three all beef enchiladas. He had those 2 meals, and now he doesn't, and he doesnt have replacements for them. If you’re trying to keep up with Zion calorically right now, you gotta feel sick to your stomach."""

"[Schiffer] Zion Williamson said he has a friend who doesn't know much about carbohydrates who always tell him ""just put food in belly."" He said that was top of mind tonight as he ate a career-high nine chipotle double wrapped barbacoa burritos."
"I'll give it a stab.  Jaylen Brown,  Zion Williamson, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, KAT (if healthy), Ja Morant, Kyrie, De'Aaron Fox (arguable, but I would say so), Brandon Ingram (same thing), McCollum until he got injured (this season),  Shai (I'm high on Shai), Maybe Kemba, Probably Vucevic, Lavine."
"Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Joel Embiid, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Zach LaVine, Zion Williamson"
Vince Carter played against Robert Parish and Zion Williamson
"People don't understand that while TS% indeed does matter, it's only ONE stat among a billion other things that a player can do well on the court and be great. Is Russell Westbrook an inefficient scorer? Yes, but he also has a 61-win pace everytime he posts a triple double, is a great playmaker on offense (five of the last six years averaging 10+ assists) and everyone talks about how great of a leader he is.  Saying that Russ isn't great because of his TS% is like saying that AI wasn't great because of his TS%, you are literally ignoring every single aspect of basketball and only focusing on scoring efficiency.  If TS% was the only thing that mattered, Joe Ingles and Rudy Gobert would be the best duo in the league with their sky high efficiency, heck Zion Williamson and his 65% TS makes him better than LeBron ofc."

&gt;I still don't have a full understanding of NBA financials and the salary caps but even though the salary cap does limit larger markets from getting all the superstars it also limits smaller markets as well does it not? Wouldn't richer teams still just pay the luxury tax for the superstars if there is no limit to how much they could pay them? I know that the nba does some type of sharing of revenue between teams so maybe that balances things out. Would no max still give richer teams the best players even if there is a salary cap? Also if you removed a max contract wouldn't that remove a player's incentive to stay with their drafted team or the team that own's their bird rights? Players like Luka Doncic and Zion Williamson really would have no reason to stay in Dallas and New Orleans right because the Knicks would have the Cap Space and the money to sign them and pay them the most amount of money that smaller markets might not want to reach? Even if the knicks went over the cap and went into luxury it would still be worth it for them if they win titles because they can easily make that money back. I know this wouldn't happen all the time but could it still happen a lot? I know teams like the knicks are profitable just for being in a large market. They can make money even without years of having no superstar and I know it's a lot harder for smaller market teams to make a profit. Sorry if most of this is incorrect but this stuff gets confusing. I would like to know if this is not the case.

Isn't Rick under contract? So like can Zion Williamson quit too and then go to a new team like Rick apparently can?
"I am sorry, but why does it matter who luka has a problem with? luka is a 3rd year basketball player is he not?  Didn't Reddit just spend all day bitching and whining about how no one should care who Zion Williamson likes? So why do we now suddenly care what this player likes?"
Man looked like Zion Williamson out there
Luka will hog the ball and turn zion into kristaps williamson
last 3 years for Giannis:  &gt;Age 24 2018-2019: 27.7  &gt;Age 25 2019-2020: 29.5  &gt;Age 26 2020-2021: 28.1  Zion Williamson:  &gt;Age 19 2019-2020: 22.5 (only 24 games and on minutes restrictions for most of them)  &gt;Age 20 2020-2021: 27.0  Is there something you were trying to point out?
"I don't mean no harm but ""family members"" need to mind their business when it comes to situations like this, last I checked when Adam Silver called his name I don't think he said "" *With the #1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft the New Orleans Pelicans select Zion Williamson AND FAMILY!!!*"" I don't believe anyone else but Zion's name was required at the dotted line. Its not a teams job to make family happy, Idk the exact details of the situation but it just feel like a bunch moochers trying to hang on his coattails and benefit from him. I understand family is important but at the end of the day he has to do best for him getting bad advice from those close to can do just as much harm. On that uncle Dennis shit."
"Zion Williamson and his family just sounds interesting, I wonder how much is actually Zion"
"Next up...          ""Zion Williamson has just signed with Klutch Sports""          Followed by...        ""Zion and LeBron seen having dinner together"""
"The lolknicks thing is part of it, but also people couldn't look at it like Porzingis was just wanting to force his way to a bigger market. People on here are super forgiving of small market teams, even if they're really poorly run. Like if De'Aaron Fox suddenly demanded a trade from the Kings you can bet people would be like ""this is bad for the league!"" even though it should be perfectly understandable if a player wants to move on from a team that hasn't made the playoffs in 15 years.   The Pelicans have been run like absolute shit for about as long, but were just more fortunate with the draft to land Chris Paul, Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson which helps paper over a lot of awful decisions otherwise. It shouldn't be a surprise that anyone wants to get away from a bad situation, but people around here tend to instead read this as ""nobody wants to play for a small market team."""
"Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler. Super spacing."
lmao if NO lucked into Zion Williamson and won't pay an extra 2 mil or whatever for a good coach
"Zion is fat and injured for the entirety of his rookie season : williamson ""family"" is silent  Pels are shit for one year and zion plays 50 good games : williamson ""family"" thinks it's time for their star to move on."
2 bench players and picks for Zion Williamson?   I’m sure the pelicans are on the phone right now.
"""Multiple sources have told The Athletic that certain family members want Williamson on another team.""  I can't read the article, but, at this point, that headline sounds like a nothing burger.  I'm sure people are grumbling.  Zion has some of the best stats in the league, and no one really paid attention to him even though he was on national tv all the time.  But, I kinda doubt he's anywhere close to forcing a trade or anything drastic."
https://247sports.com/college/duke/Article/Zion-Williamson-family-New-Orleans-Pelicans-want-him-off-team-Stan-Van-Gundy-Duke-basketball-166666342/  It's already begun...
Starts don't always tell the story. A lot of people were saying Devin Booker was an empty stats guy but once he got decent pieces around him they started to turn it around. And I'm not talking about this here if you look at last year after DeAndre Eaton came back from his suspension the sons were above .500 . Now look at Brandon Ingram who puts up pretty similar stats to Devin Booker but had a monster in the paint and Zion Williamson who I'm sure most people would say is better than DeAndre Eaton and a decent point guard in Lonzo ball and they where the 11th seed...
And Phoenix was tied for the best odds of landing the first pick. Imagine this current team + Zion MF Williamson… That would be completely game-breaking.
"&gt; star like Williamson  Bruh. I get it, Zion is awesome, but he's played 85 games and he just finished his second year."
he [debatably showed signs](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/05/zion-williamson-nba-draft-lottery-team-atlanta-hawks-logo-video-twitter-reaction) of wanting to be drafted by the Hawks
Zion Williamson averaged 27 on insane efficiency but apparently Steven held him back. I guess he would average 40 without big Steven clogging the paint.
I’ll take 1 slightly used Zion Williamson on my team 😁
"I don’t know why Ben Simmons can’t at least be more like Zion Williamson. Like Zion gets 90+% of his points in the paint, but he can shoot wide open jumpers at an ok-ish efficiency"
lmao thought they said Pelicans drafted Zion Williamson
Sounds like Zion Williamson? Idk.
Breh I thought he was gonna say Zion Williamson
&gt;jaxson Hayes  Not sure why people downvoted you     Photo of Jaxson with Zion: [https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2019/10/21/18677887/jaxson-hayes-pelicans-zion-williamson-favors-jahlil-lonzo-anthony-davis-towns-comparison-nba-draft](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2019/10/21/18677887/jaxson-hayes-pelicans-zion-williamson-favors-jahlil-lonzo-anthony-davis-towns-comparison-nba-draft)
"ah yes, the never proposed package that with a generational all star talent like zion williamson ended up being worse tham us and one of them is done instead of olympian keldon johnson, third (according to bball index) defensive big man on a 3-yyear 27M contract and an amazing vet  like demar that helped the groupp grow, ah yes."
My family members and friends tell me I look like Zion Williamson
Like a mix between Tyler Herro and Zion Williamson
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."
"The 4 out offense with 1 elite rim protector / scorer started in the 90s with Hakeem and saw utility again with the Van Gundy Magic.  Now 4+1 is the standard rather than 3+2 and more teams are going to a 5+0.  This may ultimately be a step towards ""solving"" basketball, meaning talent being equal, 5+0 &gt; 4+1 &gt; 3+2.  That isn't to say Zion Williamson can't thrive in the league.  At this point, it seems bigs are either only as valuable as the playmaker they are playing with - elite offensive engines are generating their looks (lebron &amp; dwight howard, trae young/harden &amp; clint capela) or have the ability to be a high efficiency offensive engine with gravity / playmaking (embiid / jokic).  Gobert is an example of the former and without Conley his offensive value tanked.  He lost the yin to his yang.  The Jazz tried to adjust their scheme by playing more iso heavy basketball.  I know people love Mitchell, but he just isn't efficient enough in isolation to make up for his lack of playmaking and I don't think they can win with him running the offense.  Overall, I think Gobert loses some defensive value in a true 5-0 and he loses some offensive value w/o a true playmaker."
"2036: ""The St. Louis Pelicans are looking for a Zion Williamson"""
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can’t take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that’s better than all those all stars lol"
Hes in the league right now his name is Zion Williamson
"Yeah no shit, which is why she ain't gonna pay the luxury tax this year either. Lowry ain't signing with you guys this summer, sorry. Hopefully you guys can be more competent with Zion than you were with AD [cause we've all seen what happens if you're not.](https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/6/17/22538764/zion-williamson-new-orleans-pelicans-unhappy-offseason-rumors)"
"I don’t agree that they play at the 5 when it matters most. I think they play at the 5 when their traditional big isn’t performing or there is a matchup to be exploited.  That said, my point is that while most GMs and coaches would prefer everyone on the court to have a triple, I don’t think a three-pointer is a prerequisite for a successful PF: Giannis, Draymond, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson don’t have a triple or have only shown it in spurts.  I’ll agree with you that these guys are increasingly anomalies and a PF with a 3 is generally preferred over one without, though."
Luka Doncic - Klay Thompson - Kawhi Leonard - Zion Williamson - PJ Washington.
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
"Jokic takes the ball up sometimes, but the main thing is he's the primary playmaker for the team. The ball goes through him, and he gets his teammates organised. It's fair to say he doesn't do everything a PG traditionally does though, he's more of a point center.  Zion did have stretches this season where he was the traditional point guard, bringing the ball up and running pick and roll as the ball handler and was in every sense the PG.  https://www.insider.com/zion-williamson-pelicans-point-guard-offense-working-2021-2"
"Domestically, Zion Williamson.  Being a fellow American with a name that's easy to pronounce and spell matters more than we'd like to admit."
jalen green or zion williamson
"&gt;Someone needs to ask her, ""Rachel, you just got fired from hosting the finals. How would ~~your dead mother~~ *ZION WILLIAMSON* feel?"""
The Pelicans are preparing to whine when Zion Williamson inevitably leaves

"Duke University, known for its star white players like Zion Williamson and Jayson Tatum"
"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can’t just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team. I think it’s a good mix of scoring, passing, size, defense and experience.  Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
This team has terrible chemistry! Lillard is not a good leader nor a winner imo. They need bigs like Zion Williamson and Ja Morant who play with heart.
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De’Aron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
Zion fucking Williamson. Ever heard of him? This league is downright idiotic and completely ageist
"He’s the one who tells them what to do and he’s the one that picked this garbage roster.   Jermari Grant, Zach LaVine, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee, and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant, Trae Young, Julius Randle, Russell Westbrook, and Zion Williamson??? Oh yeah, big brain time for sure."
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De’Andre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)  Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"

why isnt zion williamson in the team
"I hate Tatum on this roster he’s been absolutely useless every game for them. Lavine needs to be more of a slasher than he’s been. Having Javale on the roster is a complete embarrassment.   I’ll never understand why Trae Young, Ja Morant, Zion Williamson, and Myles Turner are not on this roster."

"How I started really getting into NBA was following college stars into their NBA career and expanding my taste from there.   For you, along with the other suggestions, I would say to pick a player to follow. I don't know what kind of player would appeal to you but I can give some recommendations.  (I am going to preface this by saying most players I list are on the younger side so you can build  a fan relationship without the dread of impending retirement)   * Luka Doncic - Dallas Mavericks - Young guard who is lighting up the NBA. Very likeable personality and fun to watch. Not as flashy as others but still very entertaining to watch. [Luka Highlights](https://youtu.be/aJBl7RMDlVo) * Trae Young - Atlanta Hawks - Another young guard that is coming into his own. Trash talker, can be flashy on the court, absolutely awesome to watch him play and interact with the fans. [Trae Young Highlights](https://youtu.be/l4Cwaj351aM)[Trae Young v New York Knicks Fans](https://youtu.be/gXPhb1HthNk) * Zion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans - Freak. He is just an athletic Freak my guy. If he can stay healthy, he is a dominant force and plays the game physically. [Zion Highlights](https://youtu.be/j3RPnA4pvKw) * Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers - Center. Big and strong dude that plays a whole lot of Defense. Sort of troll sometimes, especially if someone calls him out. ex: Andre Drummond [Joel Highlights](https://youtu.be/hxuiQrvKETs)  The NBA is stacked with talent and the youth of the league is fantastic. If you are wanting a current great that I didnt list, you cannot go wrong with Giannis, Lebron, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, or a multitude of others.   If you want to go the opposite route and choose a team first, I would recommend choosing the closest franchise to yourself. It is a whole other experience being able to attend the home games from time to time. If that's not your jam, then I would choose one of the ""younger"" teams so you can watch them grow and compete. Ex: Memphis Grizzlies, Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans.   If you do not want to cement your choice on team or player, watch the games, highlights, play the video games, get involved somehow to give yourself an interest. I would highly recommend checking out the highlights of some of the greats from the past generations and comparing them to todays game.   Whatever you decide to do, don't take the toxicity you receive from others too seriously. There is no problem with throwing your interest into a popular player or cheering for the Lakers, if that is what you like. Basketball is game and being a fan is about enjoying the product. Remember that."
Steven Adams with Zion Williamson
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
"Utah offers their name to New Orleans for Zion Williamson. Utah then goes the ""Golden State"" route and calls themselves the Zion Williamsons. Take it or leave it"
all i can think of is this https://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2019/02/su-physics-expert-breaks-down-marek-dolezaj-zion-williamson-collision.html
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"Fantastic stuff!      I'm worried about Williamson's future in New Orleans. I quite honestly think that losing Lonzo Ball will hurt the Pelican's future, because of Ball's chemistry with Williamson. We've seen it time and time again, an uber-athletic player just doesn't play to his potential and is shipped out to another team, only for that team to have an actual point guard and be able to utilize those athletic gifts. John Collins in Atlanta. Miles Bridges in Charlotte. Lob City's DJ. All of these guys are players who were effective before they got a point guard, but became elite because of a point guard. Case in point, I think losing Lonzo Ball's passing will hurt the Pelican's, and more importantly Zion's, offense.      That being said, I do think some of the skills are replaceable. Kira Lewis and NWA are solid and need another season's worth of evaluation, but look to be decent replacements. Ingram's scoring is there, and there's been a continuous upgrade to his half-court creation season-by-season. And Zion himself could become a better creator and finisher. But those are just what ifs. Losing Lonzo Ball's passing on the Pels isn't a what if, those lobs are on the money every time."
"I know I know boo hoo, but the Celtics luck under the curse of Isaiah Thomas has been kind of crazy. Hayward's leg and subsequent injuries. Kyrie's... whatever the fuck that was that Kyrie did. Lottery picks from the basement-dwelling Kings and the Grizzlies turning into Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith instead of, like, Zion Williamson and Tyrese Haliburton. The worst 2020-2021 covid shitstorm in the league.  I can't be mad or anything, because we were probably the luckiest team in the league for the three years prior. Scary Terry almost took us to the finals for fuck's sake."
"Zion Williamson, if he can lead the Pelicans to the playoffs and a high seed , then he will be in the mix."
Dukes Young Core  Cam Reddish  RJ Barrett  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Wendell Carter Jr
Role player who won 5 all stars was all nba all defense and a 3 time champion yea that’s greater than someone who has made all league a couple times and has 0 rings. Will luka be better all time when it’s all said and done yes obviously but you gotta make people earn it. Is Zion Williamson higher on your all time list than John Stockton Carmelo Reggie Miller. Apparently in your mind Lamelo ball has had a more successful nba career than a player like Jason Williams who won a ring and was a very good starting PG for years like how could you have a guy who played 41 games be higher than another who played 13 seasons in the league just cause in Lamelos peak he looked better. Will Lamelo end up being better than Jason Williams of course but he has to earn it first and play some years have some common sense man😂😂😂
Derrick rose - Luka Doncic - Zion Williamson - Giannis Antentoukounmpo - Steven Adams
"imma do a hot take and say… ZION WILLIAMSON lol  It’s unrealistic, but I hope the Pels can put enough pieces around him, they could become Bucks 2.0. If they get a decent coach, who’ll utilize their 1-2 punch effectively, and they fix their defense enough, they could gun for a 3rd seed with Zion averaging 28-30/7/5 (based on his trajectory). He could the Giannis route, and he’s aleady an elite finisher with decent shooting (on worse defense). Average defense but stellar offense would make him a dark horse MVP. Plus Ingram could take the Middleton route, too. 20ppg scorer with average defense who can also become a closer.  The media will hype the fuck outta him (after being forgotten this year) and every other narrative will drown, lol."
"10 . New Orleans Pelicans Josh Giddey | 6-8 wing | 18 years old | Adelaide The player: Giddey had a terrific season in Australia, averaging 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, leading the league in helpers and finishing sixth in rebounding as an 18-year-old. He needs to tighten up his handle a bit and keep improving as a shooter, but the skill set here is perfect for that of a secondary playmaker at the next level due to how quickly he processes the game. Giddey should be a very high-level role player who starts, with some upside for more if the jumper gets figured out.  The fit: I have less of a feel for the Pelicans than any other team in the top 10. They have a tendency to draft younger (Kira Lewis, Zion Williamson and Jaxson Hayes were all teenagers when they were picked, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker was 20 years old) under this regime. Plus, their backcourt of the future could use a bit more size. I’ve gone Giddey here, who would be a pretty great replacement for Lonzo Ball, given that Ball is a free agent and no guarantee to re-sign in New Orleans. One other note on Giddey: he has a lot of fans in ranges of the draft that aren’t his projected range, including Toronto — one of the few teams to send personnel to see him live this year in Australia. Don’t be surprised to see a team target him in a trade situation."

"You can out Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Zion WIlliamson, Paul George, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, ect. on the Timberwolves and they will still almost certainly be a Lottery team.  Basketball is a team sport, I find it outrageous to blame the Star for a teams lack of success."
"I’d say that Antetokounmpo is on his way there. Doncic is definitely skillful enough, I’d say he has that potential. And the third one I’d put on that list is Zion Williamson. He is still very much at the beginning of his NBA journey, he has potential to be extremely dominant."
"You guys acting like Cade is a surefire superstar and the Pistons would be dumb to pass on him. This kid ain't no LeBron James, Anthony Davis or Zion Williamson.   Green, Suggs and Mobley are not THAT far behind Cade. Each one of them could end up being a better player. The Pistons are smart to explore trade down options."
"Zion Williamson. I love the guy but I don't think he's the superstar everyone is hyping him up to be, his stamina is bad and his health is a massive question mark at his size."
"Zion Williamson, idfc."
"No offense to Pelicans fans, but the NOLA situation is looking pretty messy. AD and Jrue both wanted out. Zion is now going into his third season with his third head coach. There's already mumbling [about Zion's circle wanting him out](https://theathletic.com/2656520/2021/06/17/inside-the-end-of-stan-van-gundy-with-the-pelicans-and-an-ongoing-battle-to-keep-zion-williamson-happy/). Trading JJ to Dallas rather than a team he wanted to rubbed Zion the wrong way and then JJ blasted Griff on the way out (although that's not that surprising coming from JJ)."
"I mean I would, but I guess that’s the difference between me and Zion Williamson"
"No? I think the nuggets are perfectly happy with MPJs trajectory without needing to compare him to Zion, who is not only a totally different player, but also someone who is totally irrelevant to their franchise plans.  I can see the front office discussions now:  “Hey, I think we should max this MPJ kid. He’s been historically good and is a perfect fit next to our MVP. And if we let him walk, we can’t really replace him because we are already over the cap. Plus we are a small market so who is even coming here anyway.”  “On the other hand, he’s literally not Zion Williamson, so he’s probably trash and we should let him walk in FA”  “Oh shit, good point. I hadn’t considered that angle.”"

"&gt;New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson is recovering from surgery to repair a fractured foot, David Griffin, VP of basketball operations for the Pelicans, said on Monday during the team's media day.

Zion is easily 300+ he was 285 at Duke when he looked like [this](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/zion-williamson-duke-freshman-scouting-comparables.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all) and now he looks like this [This](https://twitter.com/StepbackAch/status/1440750443861209093)
"I think we’ll see a dominant big man who can control the paint while also having an insanely quick release and money from deep. A player with Shaq’s body and intensity with the finesse of Durant. Put another way, a taller Zion Williamson with Kevin Durant’s abilities."
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
"Trae will have more career success than Luka early on, then Luka will go to the Hawks in free agency 2025 to team up with him. They’ll make the finals but lose to a tough Nuggets team led by Nikola Jokic, who gets his first ring and has an alltime great playoff performance where he knocks off a solid Blazers team, the prior year champion Lakers, and an on the rise OKC team led by young studs Emoni Bates, Josh Giddey, and Amari George. Luka and Trae then proceed to win the next two finals, but fail to threepeat due to the poetic basketball of the Warriors which serves as the last hurrah for Steph, Klay, and Draymond but is a coming out party for young stud Jordan Walsh. Luka then returns to the Mavs, forming an intense rivalry with the Celtics who have added walking mismatch and former MVP Zion Williamson to their already all-NBA core of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bob Williams. The Mavs somehow triumph against the Celtics in Luka’s second year back, making him a Dallas legend. After a few years, he goes to the Lakers where he wins another chip and cements himself as a potential GOAT. By this point, Trae has retired largely due to recurring ankle injuries but is considered a top 10 PG of all time."
"Simple fix,  If a player refuses to to play, due to non-medical reasons and isn't excused from the Team you have 4 phases:  **3 Days AWOL** \- Team begins fining players  **7 Days AWOL** \- Teams can move them to Commissioners Exempt List, which requires a 30 day stay(Date is retroactive from the 1s Day AWOL) minimum.  Players will report directly to the league office regarding their status, location, medical situation, etc at that point. Players agree their reports will be available to ALL league personnel who inquires about their status at that point.  Players are required to report to the league office their status weekly.  Players are required to undergo a physical exam, every 30 days being on the commissioner exempt lists. Players will be paid 65% of the their base salary, plus any fines leveled by the team.  Physical examination, and weekly status reports are requirements to continue to be paid.  Players on the exempt list at the Commissioners discretion will be advised on their availability to media and attendance to NBA Events (so you can't sit attend NBA games while on the list for instance).  The player can be replaced on their roster but their salary still counts against the cap in full at this point. (This allows the league to step in on toxic situations and allows teams to have full status of players).    **30 Days AWOL** \- Teams can move to terminate the player's contract.  Players on the Commissioners Exempt Lists can request arbitration, if termination is sought. Once arbitration starts, a player can't be traded or cut. Players can not move to a new team until arbitration is completed, and ineligible for NBA competition 180 days from original AWOL Date. (This is basically both parties have agreed its best everyone moves on).  Teams can be compensated in the form of cash, trade exemptions, and draft picks (non-lottery). (Zion Williamson Rule, Zion wants out fine, New Orleans gets a $15M trade exemption)  Players signed due to being on Commissioners Exempt Lists can sign with a new team, for league minimum, HOWEVER their salary cap value will be assigned based on the previous played 82 Games Metrics, and league awards earned the previous 3 seasons. Players are ineligible for NBA competition for 180 days from AWOL Date.   The Commissioner can add players to the list at the player's request.  So an example James Harden wanted out of Houston, the next team still pays him $1.3M for the minimum, but his Salary Cap Value is $38M, so the next team still has to gut their roster to get him.  **60 Days+ AWOL** \- Players on Commissioner's list will be paid 50% of base salary, and continue to report to  The League Office. During this time, players can be traded, or waived. If player under contract is on the The List when their contract expires. The player is ineligible for NBA competition for 180 days from the start of their next contract.  Mean signing in July not eligible until after New Years.  Players not on the List will get issued a full release from their contract, and stop being fined.  The player will be ineligible for NBA competition for a full calendar year retroactively. (Kawhi Leonard Rule)  Commissioner can remove a player from The List at their discretion.  So basically, if player wants out of a situation, they have to forgo salary for a year.  Yes, players could collude to end up in their chosen destination, but they would do so with a year lay-off.  If a franchise wants to take that chance, thats on them."

"Oh I see. I'll try to get some of the main stuff for you; so long comment incoming ;)  Well, a lot of stuff happened since then. Luka Doncic (rookie in 2019 with the mavs) is now a top 5/6 player in the league; Kawhi keeps getting hurt and since the 2020 finals, LeBron and AD have been injured a lot (especially AD, but he was always injury prone anyways).  Two kids, Zion Williamson (Pelicans) and Ja Morant (Memphis) have already turned into all star caliber players (#1 and #2 pick of 2020 draft respectively). Zion is having some health issues due to his enormous weight at his 6'6 height tho.  The bucks were last season's champs, but battled hard on their way, especially against the Nets (KD, an injured Harden, and an injured Kyrie). That series happened in the 2nd round and was by far the biggest showdown of the year. KD proved to the whole world he was still arguably the best player in the world by recovering from his achilles injury. Giannis on the other hand man ! He was on a tear, especially in the finals. Great series as well. I'd recomment watching it.  On the other hand, the sixers, who performed very well in the regular season last year, still have a Ben Simmons problem. Some all time drama happened in the offseason following their elimination by the hawks in the 2nd round. Ben doesn't want to suit up, and now is faking mental health issues to not play with the sixers until they trade him.  Kyrie is a big antivaxx guy now, and he won't play a game until he gets his shot. He is so crazy right now he might even retire just to ""stand up"" for his cause.  Westbrook is now the all time leader in triple doubles. He went from OKC to Hou to Washington to LAL in 3 years.   That's a little bit of what happened these last couple of years. If you have any question, I'm here for you mate !"

Jonas Valanciunas scored 20 points for the Pelicans. They dropped to 1-9 as they start the season without injured star forward Zion Williamson."
Does Zion Williamson even play Basketball?
"In reality, Zion last year had a better season than RJ will ever have in his career. I still would take Zion every day over Ja, but I at least understand why people would take Ja. It’s absurd to think that someone would pick RJ Barrett over Zion Williamson in a redraft."
"And Zion has other worldly strength, coordination, and body control.   [NBA GMs voted him most athletic](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2019/10/17/zion-williamson-nba-gm-survey-most-athletic-rookie-of-the-year/)  [John Walls comments on him](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2730326-john-wall-says-zion-williamson-is-one-of-most-athletic-players-hes-ever-seen)  So looks like your idea that being in shape is the same as athleticism, but being in shape is different then conditioning - the process of training to become physically fit by a regimen of exercise, diet, and rest.   So by definition Athleticism has a lot to do with speed, strength, acceleration of which Zion ranks very highly for all of them. His conditioning isn’t as good, but no one has ever said that guys like Curry or Reddick are the most athletic players in the league.   Anyways you’ve been talking out of your ass and refuse to admit that you were wrong that being bigger and more athletic doesn’t equate to less injuries"
Zion isn’t trying to get into basketball shape. He’s trying to become a basketball shape. Zion believes so deeply that Ball is Life that he has chosen to become one with the Ball. After all you can’t spell Williamson without WILSON.
"I don't pay much attention to the debate over whether the stars of the prior generation would succeed today.  While the style of basketball has changed, the game has not.  You still need to put the ball in the basket, rebound, pass, etc.  Good is good.  Zion Williamson, when healthy, completely dominates the game even though he doesn't shoot much.  Well, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone were pretty similar players.  Both of those guys would absolutely dominate the modern NBA.  Demar DeRozan is a SG that is not a threat from distance (although he's a little better this year).  He has been the best player on the Bulls this year, who are outperforming expectations.  Yet Demar is just a worse version of Jordan, and similar to Alex English.  Neither of those guys dominated from 3, but both would kill in the modern game.  I dunno.  Good is good."
Well it would completely depend on what kind of player the 1st pick was. Like you’d need that kind of package in 2019 to move from Deandre Hunter to Zion Williamson.   Either way that just helps my point. They have a ridiculous amount of assets. It makes more sense to trade some of those assets to build around Shai than to trade Shai or even more assets
Zion Williamson played in one half of one Summer League game before injuring his knee and tore his meniscus in the pre-season which caused him to miss the first 44 games of the season.

"This might surprise you a bit, but Cade Cunningham, Zion Williamson, and Markelle Fultz are different people and their performance is wholly irrelevant to one another."
"Let’s look into 2 No. 1 picks who were injured to start their careers.   1. Zion Williamson. Sure, he played the preseason, but he still missed a lot of games to start. Once he got back? 24-36 from the field. Competition? The #3 Nuggets and #3 Celtics in 2 of his first 3 games. Stats? 16-25 from the field. Zion had one less made field goal and 3 more 3s in 1 game than Cade has so far. He was a prodigy? Let’s take a look at Rookie 2.   2. Markelle Fultz. Widely considered a bust by his first season. Played 2 preseason games, then didn’t play until November. And guess what? He injured his shooting shoulder. That impacts shooting more than Cade’s ankle sprain. What was Markelle’s stats to start? 15-40 from the field. That’s 37.5%. Bad competition? On his way to 40 FGA, Fultz went against the Raptors and Celtics. The top 2 teams in the East at the time.   And these aren’t full season stats. I took their games that made them reach Cade’s 39 FGA, and both performed way better than Cade has. Even freaking Fultz with an injury to his shooting hand and a broke jumper shot better than Cade is."
