mason plumlee
I don’t know guys I still think I would rather have Mason Plumlee
Kelly olynyk  Daniel Theis  Richaun Holmes  Hissan Whiteside  Khem Birch  Bismack Biyombo  These are the best guys available that can get signed under the MLE  I could see a world where they trade for Mason plumlee maybe?
"Wood has improved a ton defensively in recent games, he was pretty bad at the start of the year. Thank god we got Mason Plumlee instead...."
Good luck.  The Mason Plumlee market is heating up as we speak.  Jordan offered 2 Cuban cigars and a bottle of Scotch.  Not the good stuff.
DJ Augustin  Eric Gordon  Danny Green  Jae Crowder  Mason Plumlee  Actually has solid spacing and is solid defensively.
I think that going from current barely-an-NBA-player DeAndre Jordan to peak Clippers DeAndre Jordan would be such a massive improvement that it would be the Nets. The current defense and rebounding weakness they have would be largely erased. They'd also get Heat Tyler Johnson and whatever the best version of Jeff Green was.   The 2013-2014 Nets could be another answer for the second question.  Deron Williams/Shaun Livingston   Joe Johnson/Jason Terry   Paul Pierce/Andrei Kirilenko   Kevin Garnett/Mirza Teletovic   Brook Lopez/Mason Plumlee
Mason Plumlee is the best Jokic-stopper in the league.

"Westbrook carrying without Durant hits different than Jokic carrying without... Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee.  Westbrook also made averaging a triple-double seem almost normal, so it won't be as big a deal if Jokic does it this year."
"Mason Plumlee is already above average for a center in many aspects of his game, can dribble a bit, is a good passer, athletic, give him the goat shot jump shot, and that opens everything for him.   Or some other similar center, with that jump shot, would already be better than AD, which is close to GOAT status I suppose."
Mason Plumlee should not be a starting NBA center
"Westbrook had the twin narratives of ""carrying OKC without Durant"" and ""first guy to average a trip-dub since Oscar.""   Jokic has.... ""carried DEN without Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee""?"
"And he did it against Mason Plumlee, one of the greatest centers of all time."
"Pistons choked so hard. Horrible shot selection in the last 3 mins and overtime. This teams half court offense consists of errant Jeremi Grant shots, Blake griffin attempting to post someone up and flailing, and Derrick rose trying to be Derrick rose of 2010 and failing horribly. Add in mason plumlee being a complete bonehead and these are your 2021 pistons. Sad."
"I know, but I'd rather see a young center play those mins, then a below average back up getting all those mins.  Heck a reclamation project like Okafor doesn't bother me at all, play him more see what he got instead of watchig Mason Plumlee playing almost 30 minutes per game"

"Detroit Pistons are certainly your team. They’re the closest team to Canada, as you can see Detroit from Canada. They have two all-NBA players in Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, which there are teams out there that have never had a guy make all-NBA.  Mason Plumpee is in his 7th season, which is a known notorious time for players to really make a jump in skill, so it’s possible they have another all-NBA guy soon. Jahlil Okafor is a former top 3 pick, and he might explode into an all-star soon as well. Between Griffin, Plumlee, and Okafor they average a whopping 28 points per game! Not only that, all 3 combine for 0.8 blocks a game, so they have some real dominant rim protection!  They have a rookie named Killian Hayes, who has exploded onto the scene and is the top rookie out there right now, potentially their 4th all-NBA guy. He’s already averaging 4.6 points per game, so by the time he hits Plumlee’s experience he’ll probably be averaging 9 points per game! He shoots a blistering 28% from the field and 25% from 3 point land. This means that he hits roughly one out of every four shots he takes. Now that’s not quite Steph Curry level yet, it’s hard to envision him not getting to that level as a shooter going off of his promising start to his rookie campaign.  The fans are amazing and passionate fans. Ron Artest loved the fans in Detroit so much that he actually got a game stopped because he wanted to go socialize with the average Detroitian. They ended up fist bumping and having a great relationship even though it messed with the game.  So all in all, I don’t see a reason why not to go with the Pistons. The two already all-NBA guys are a great base, seeing Plumlee develop into one will be a treat, and I already explained how Killian Hayes may be the second coming of Steph Curry. I wouldn’t expect that much this year from them, but next year they are real candidates to break the all time wins record of 73-9, so you can hop on the bandwagon early and then when they take the league over you’ll be one proud papa peacock."
Great question and very evenly matched. If it’s 3 on 3 it may come down to who can play some on the perimeter. Mason Plumlee can probably play a little PG as you mentioned because he’s a good passer. But Cody Zeller is pretty quick for his size (same with Tyler Zeller too actually). I’ll go with the Zellers but it’s a toss up.
pistons. jerami grant. killian hayes. blake griffin. uhhh mason plumlee yea it stops there
You joke but is Mason Plumlee actually not better than Deandre.
Nets should trade for Mason Plumlee.
"Mason Plumlee, he looks like don from Napoleon dynamite."
"I need a shirt with Blake Griffin, Derek Rose, Jerami Grant, and Mason Plumlee on it thats says “My clip is empty.”"
So he’s basically Mason Plumlee now
"Hello? Did you just happen to miss Larry Nance Jr, Mason Plumlee, and Hamidou Diallo? Not to mention LaMelo at 11."
"Who cares? He is a shit scorer, Curry is still 32424 times better as a playmaker because his scoring is respected and he creates for others, Draymond does not create shit he just passes to open people  Passing is almost useless if you are not a great scorer, Mason Plumlee is actually an elite passer but nobody cares"
"You forgot about Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson and Delon Wright in Detroit."
MF spent $8m for Mason Plumlee then tweets this  Real ass dude of the week
"Mentioned in another thread, going by Eric Gordon's new comments, it feels like we're at the part after a superstar trade where fans and the other teammates convince themselves that trading one of the Top 6 talents in the league is actually *good* for the team.  It's not.  Then the team implodes because the star made the mish-mash group of players work and everything implodes around the franchise.  If I'm the Nets I'm not too concerned about Harden and Durant resigning when their deals are up. I'd be more concerned about Kyrie, and if I'm the Nets, I try to trade him.  If I'm them, I wouldn't expect fair value, just go for depth; a solid G who can play D or hold the fort till Dinwiddie returns, a C that can do the same, and another F that can score a bit, etc.  I also mentioned other day that I thought DET could be a landing spot for Kyrie, and after GM's recent comments, it wouldn't surprise me.  If DET offered Rose (or Svi Mykhailiuk), Jerami Grant, and Mason Plumlee, Nets consider that if they think Kyrie won't fit, no? Does DET have an extra first from another team they can throw in?  That's the kind of depth trade I mean. Get some/any value you can back. And DET, it's a chance at relevancy/maybe a higher ceiling than they currently have. It's going to be hard for them to get that level of star otherwise. Maybe he and Blake work decent or sell some tickets."

He was against Mason Plumlee that's why
The captol stuff took over the news but this still made sports center and first take. I think you have to make a grand gesture esp after highly impactful events and rulings like the Blake ruling. The doc rivers. Jaylen brown. Lebron stuff hits because those guys a household names (jaylen to a lesser extent) but im not so.sure folks want to hear what Mason plumlee has to say about black lives matter.
They need mason plumlee back
Bruh we are seriously taking about Mason Plumlee? That’s literally my point. They aren’t the 29th defensive team in the league. They were 11th last season. Plumlee could be Bill Russell and Grant could Scottie Pippen and you would not expect that drop off. Grant himself over the regular season didn’t actually have much of an impact. He’s a great individual defender and an average team defender. For the 28 teams that don’t have giant scoring wings JaMicheal Green will do 90% of what Grant did.
"&gt;When the FUCK did you decide Mason Plumlee was a superstar?  The refs didn't decide, God himself decided it when he blessed us with Plumdog."
Him   John Collins in a pistons uniform next year sounds kinda nice and would help our rebuild considering our best center is Mason Plumlee...
"idk why yall are hating on the pistons offseason, they signed two superstars in mason plumlee and jerami grant, who else would be getting these calls?"
You just can't handle that Mason Plumlee is the new Shaq.
I mean the draft wasn’t great and I certainly have my doubts about Edwards but it almost seems like people are acting like we took Mason Plumlee number 1 and will be lucky to get anything out of him. He’s still the number 1 pick and I expect him to end up being a quality starter.
Mason Plumlee has T-Rex arms
Yea you are right...NBA superstar Mason Plumlee
"All that tells you is that Mason Plumlee is as effective at a 20mpg backup role against other backups as Drummond is at a starting role against other starters. I don't know how much you expect from Plumlee, though, so that might still be surprising."
"Plumlee is only making $8mil. So they aren't paying him more than the Wood offer. Still a silly signing.   Mason Plumlee will have made $72mil in the NBA when this 3-year contract ends. How is that possible!?!?!  (Honestly though, Plumlee's advanced stats make him look far better than I would have guessed. By WS/48, he's barely distinguishable from Andre Drummond.)"
What's with Mason Plumlee being chosen over legit awesome centers?
Then why sign vets like Jerami grant and mason plumlee? And Wood on 11M a year has insane trade value.
so the Pistons decided Mason Plumlee was worth more than Christian Wood. Ok then

"&gt; racism no doubt plays a role. Most of the players are black.  I don't see any hesitation to call white players overpaid as well - eg, Chandler Parsons, Kevin Love, Steven Adams, Mason Plumlee. Ask Celtics fans if they think Gordon Hayward's salary was worth it, or Lakers fans if they think Mozgov was overpaid.   It's just natural that in a league where most of the players are black, most of the overpaid players will also be black.   In the NFL, most of the overpaid QBs are white, and most of the overpaid WRs or CBs are black. That's because most of the total QBs are white, and most of the total WRs and CBs are black."
"I think even your bigs have been inadequate at protecting the paint. Mason Plumlee feasted on y'all in game 1. If Blake were anything like his former self, he probably would've done the same."

Detroit keeps Mason Plumlee
Drawing up a fucking Mason Plumlee iso after a timeout.  Casey is a mad lad.
ISO MASON PLUMLEE
Out of timeout Mason plumlee postup just as we all expected
"Yeah but less points than Terrence Ross, less rebounds than Mason Plumlee, and less assists than Demar Derozan"
Mason Plumlee and Blake Griffin are two aptly named dudes.
Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee. They made the wrong moves in the off-season.
Screen Assists. Basically if someone sets a screen that results in a made basket it’s counted as a screen assist just like if a pass results in a made basket it’s a regular assist.  NBA.com even tracks it [here](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle/?dir=1&amp;sort=SCREEN_ASSISTS)  The Jazz are scoring 20ppg of Gobert’s screens. Sabonis is second with 19ppg then it drops off to Mason Plumlee at 13.
"all this time, it was mason plumlee that was holding the nuggets together"
Can’t believe the Milwaukee Bucks had him in their program. Him and Giannis would’ve been a problem. Also was with the Pelicans and they chose Jalil Okafor over him. What’s even crazier is the Pistons choosing Mason Plumlee over him and Wood was on a tear to end last season
Looks at timothy Mozgov &amp; Mason Plumlee  I think he gotta shot.
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
"Well if the idea is strictly to acquire his bird rights for a sign and trade, that expands the list a little bit. I imagine that's where the Pistons' interest lies. Supposedly those discussions centered around Mason Plumlee."
I honestly expected another 100 point game before seeing Mason Plumlee and DSJ both having triple doubles in the same game while playing for the Pistons.
Keep saying dumb shit to distract yourself from the big fat L Mason Plumlee and Dennis Smith Jr handed your sorry team
Mason Plumlee would like a word.
"[When, not if ](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/mason-plumlee-and-pursuit-triple-double-question-when-not-if-it-happens) for the big fella"
"&gt;  TJ McConnell, Dennis Smith Jr, Mason Plumlee   ah yes the usual suspects"
Mason Plumlee? More like Beast-on Plumlee.
Don't forget the triple double tandem of DSJ and Mason Plumlee.  What a weird game this was.
"Man, that ""will Mason Plumlee have two triple doubles within 30 days"" bet I took before the season is going to bankrupt me. Stop laughing you guys I have to sell my house this isn't funny."
DSJ and Mason Plumlee best PG and C combo since Magic/Kareem
Mason plumlee career season
"The three players to record a triple double tonight so far are Mason Plumlee, Dennis Smith Jr. and TJ McConnell (with steals!).      What even is basketball."
"Yup, it’s why Denver has a long list of players leaving for more minutes/bigger roles.   Jusuf Nurkic Evan Fournier Trey Lyles Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Mason Plumlee  Will Barton will definitely be next."
it's Mason Plumlee
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
"horrible take...  Firstly Jamal been playing very well in the last 20 games. Secondly, ""Will Barton is hurt, we really miss him in the playoffs"" to now he's the worst starter in the league.  Thirdly, PER is a horrible stat by itself when its not supplemented by anything, just pointing out PER and saying hey look they have low PER is weak. Mason Plumlee - 17.5 PER and Denver let him go??? BIG LOSS?? NO."
Mason Plumlee is only 30.
"By Jokic and Harden? Yeah that will happen. When the Jazz match Gobert's minutes with Jokic or Harden, of course the defensive numbers will be better when Gobert comes off along with Jokic and Harden, who get replaced by... Mason Plumlee and Eric Gordon  The Jazz were still better with Gobert on the floor than not. And considering he played 30 MPG in 2019 and 38 MPG in 2020, the sample size with Gobert *off* the floor is pretty small"
Mason Plumlee is a freak athlete relative to the general public. In the NBA he doesn’t stand out athletically at all
"I once heard someone refer to Mason Plumlee as sneaky athletic. Like, the dude is 6’11”, can jump out of the gym, and is very muscular. That’s probably about as conspicuously athletic as it gets and then you throw in his pasty, white skin, blond hair, and giant head? Homeboy couldn’t sneak if he wanted to."
Mason Plumlee played in this 27-poiny blowout.
"Mason Plumlee:’Miss me yet, dude?’"
Can we give some love to Mason Plumlee who's playing a like a budget Jokic right now?
Mason. plumlee aka jokic’s dad😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
"Mason Plumlee is a good passer, but he’s not a playmaker. For big men, it’s not like Giannis or Jokic who generate an insane amount of points for their teammates, it’s moreso just being an accurate passer with ok decision making (Plumlee).  OP should’ve distinguished between passing and playmaking"
Yeah guys like Mason plumlee are ass and he's an excellent passer but non shooter. Turner is better than him just for shooting alone

Mason Plumlee isn’t a slouch either
Mason Plumlee could average a triple double if a coach gave him the same freedom to fuck up that Russ has. Probably on better shooting percentages too.

"We're still having a losing season, but it's the Pistons most enjoyable season in a long time and yeah I include the 2 playoffs seasons.  Besides Hayes our young players play well, our acquisitions that I was sure we were overpaying have been fine, most of the reclamation projects have been decent (even DSJ), and we'll have a high draft pick at the end of the year.  I gotta apologize to Troy Weaver after killing him in the offseason (still would love to have Christian Wood instead of Mason Plumlee and the stretch of Dedmon tho)"
"Jokic hands down looks like the one star in the NBA you wouldn't think could do what he does.  Even at his size.  Before I moved I spent 4 years in Denver and saw his progression and it's mind blowing.  I'm 10x more scared of Jokic brother than I am of him (his one brother is at EVERY game, his other brother is at about 2/3 of them, they are fucking crazy, Im more scared of the one who doesn't do MMA.)  I'll put it this way and I had it in my original post but took it out because it didn't really fit.  When you have good seats you see how good these guys are, you're a little less tempted to talk shit to Mason Plumlee when you see him jump 11.5' in the air for a rebound and then turn and dribble the ball up court.  Sure he turns it over 60% of the time and can't hit a FT but that doesn't take away his athletic ability.   Kirk Hinrich was one guy who you think ""I could take him"" then you see how fucking big he is in real life and you second guess that.    Gilbert Arenas had the fastest release I think i've ever seen off the dribble, he was so much faster live than he looked on TV.    I KNOW I could have guarded end of career Derrick Fisher, until he'd flex his popeye arms on me and crush me.  Raymond Felton turned to me and said, ""Man Fuck You!"" when I made a cupcake comment at him.  That's always one of my favorite ones because it made the TNT camera guy laugh.    I stopped talking shit to players for the most part, but I do love to yell things like ""DUKE SUCKS"" when someone from Duke is shooting a free throw."
we have Mason Plumlee as our starting C. that's how serious we are about the Cade sweepstakes.
"To be fair that was a fit pick. Mason Plumlee is a passing big man, while Demarcus is an iso scorer. On a team of stars you'd want Plumdog, but if you told me to pick a player without any other roster knowledge I'd have taken Boogie (at the time)."
"And yet, Team USA elected to go with Mason Plumlee over him. What does that tel you?"

Not this year. Our defense sucks and whenever Jokic isn’t on the floor we look like a bottom feeder. We need another Mason Plumlee and some defensive stoppers BAD

Lol rudy is a glorified mason plumlee. Mitchell can score 30 points on 25 shots  but he's fearless. The jazz are not going to be able to get last the 2nd round. Gobert is useless in the playoffs. reddit hypes utah up for them to perpetually disappoint.
"Prime Rose, Blake, Jerami Grant, Josh Jackson, rookie Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, Wayne Ellington. The Pistons would go from the worst team in the East to a playoff team, but I don't think they would have been title contenders."
"Nuggets lost Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig, three of their best bench defensive pieces. That'll hurt you."
That’s where Denver miss Mason Plumlee and Jeremy Grant.
Mason Plumlee would be a corn farmer
Mason Plumlee
"Josh Jackson and Mason plumlee are not getting traded, and delon wright shouldn't and probably won't. Idk why but everyone has an obsession with selling everyone that isn't young, it's ok to have some vets and rotational pieces. Also next year is Blake's last year of his contract, waiting it out isn't really that bad"
Mason Plumlee has entered the chat
Drummond will never be what Chandler was on defense.   He'd be Mason Plumlee with better rebounding and worse passing. Drummond is and never was that talented.
"It's subjective for each league too. Our 10 person league votes on rules each season, and the voting has shifted our points to be much more favorable to centers. So all of a sudden, a guy like mason plumlee is a more attractive piece on a roster than deangelo russell. there's just not a blanket evaluation of a roster unless you know the league and the strategy."
Troy Weaver won’t get it because the pistons are bad but he’s been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who’s now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who’s now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who’s now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become

Mason Plumlee
"Yeah because there's no point in comparing them.  Anyone with a brain can see Jrue is the best Holiday, and Mason is the best Plumlee."
There are two Laker flakes in this post. One guy talking about seeing mason Plumlee and the other about seeing the bucks.   You're literally you instigating with this post while blaming Laker fans lol
Reminds me of the time I saw Mason Plumlee at smashburger. Great stories all around
"The thing that people don't realize is that most of the bench is new. Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig were all rotational players who left in the offseason. Integrating new players, injuries, and trying to get Michael Porter, Jr. to understand the NBA game is why the team is underperforming."
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
"It’s pretty amazing that Mason Plumlee is a huge factor for the Pistons, but I’m not complaining"
Kaminsky is poor man's Olynyk. Mason Plumlee is poor man's Jokic
"Can't count how many times we've been in close games and in the closing stretch, we give the ball to Mason Plumlee to go 1 on 1 with whoever's guarding him and get a bucket. You tell me what that looks like"

"Nuggets fan here:   We lost Jeremi grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig- which was almost our entire bench unit. Jeremi would come to be a starter and then we’d pull Millsap off the bench, but yeah, our team didn’t get better. Isaiah Hartenstein was signed to replace plumlee but has not been playing well and he’s the only other center on our roster besides Jokic.  Combine that with nagging injuries to Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, and now even PJ Dozier. Our team is being forced to play 3rd string players significant minutes and play our remaining starters too many minutes.   We’ve even attempted small ball (maybe even considered “micro ball”) lineups, with 4 small guards and Jamykel Green at center, who are always outmatched and cannot make up for their size.   The off-season was not kind to us and even though I believe we could still make a splash in the playoffs with reduced rotation, we’re going to have trouble getting a good spot with a healthy bunch at this rate."
"DJJ, De’Anthony Melton, Rondo, Mason Plumlee, Hernangomez, Harrell, etc just last year alone.  I know you hate THT but he will get paid based of potential alone."
"We have 7 players with at least 5 triple doubles so far this season. Do you know how many had at least 5 in *all* of 2014-15? One, which was Westbrook. This isn’t taking anything away from Westbrook but yeah, the mystique of getting a triple double has faded away. Even Mason Plumlee has 2 this year."
Damn bro thats crazy the Pistons have as good a team as the Nets that gives him the opportunity to have a wide open lane rather than needing to close out to Mason Plumlee or Sekou Doumbiya
Yeah I don't doubt it   I used to talk to a rich chick who had a friend who got flown out by Mason fucking Plumlee lmao.
"You aren’t familiar with the elite tier spacing that Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, and Jahlil Okafor were providing Blake early this season so that nobody was clogging the lane defensively?"
Mason Plumlee
"Yeah like idk what his problem is, he’s acting like I said Mason Plumlee is better than Giannis lol. Not like Jokic has been playing at an mvp level or anything."
You’re telling me that signing Mason Plumlee to be your STARTING Center doesn’t look like tanking? Lmao.
is Mason Plumlee injured?
AG is low-key an unholy fusion of Mason Plumlee and Gary Harris
Like Mason Plumlee at his best.
The Mason Plumlee special
That's the most American shit I've ever heard. Mason Plumlee is American enough for all of us.

I mean they were a Hail Mary Mason Plumlee fuckup from being 2-2 last year. It’s not like the Blazers-Warriors series a couple years back where it was entirely hopeless
all this to beat mason plumlee 🤣😂🤣🤪🤪
Mason Plumlee wasn't our best player dude. It was Bol.
"I think you mean Jeremy Grant told Mason Plumlee to double Lebron instead of guarding AD, so AD was left wide open."
it comes full circle.  The Blazers technically drafted RHJ but traded his rights to the Nets for Mason Plumlee.
"For anyone wondering:  RHJ (on draft night) for Mason Plumlee + Pat Connaughton from Brooklyn   Plumlee for Nurk + a 1st from Denver a year later.   That 1st + another 1st to Sacramento for the 10th pick, Zach Collins.  Interestingly that Nuggets -&gt; Blazers -&gt; Kings pick was used to select harry Giles. who is also currently a Blazer."
Isn't he a defensive God? Someone tell me how I should feel. We originally drafted this dude and then traded him on draft night for Mason Plumlee
"I doubt it, but Colangelo’s comments about “vowing to remember” team USA withdrawals make me a bit nervous. I’ll be so freaking pissed if I see players like Mason Plumlee and Derrick White out there in Tokyo"
Jokic and a 1st for mason plumlee would have been the greatest heist ever lol
"Better centers. Jo Jo, Jokic, Vucivic, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Drummond, Allen, Nurkic, Aldridge, KAT, Ayton, Gobert, Steven Adams, Clint Capella, Christian Wood Ehhh bout the same: Mason Plumlee, Time Lord, Noel, Poetl, Claxton, Kanter."

"Hard disagree. I physically cringed whenever Mason Plumlee touched the basketball. On defense, a ridiculous amount of defensive breakdowns could be traced back to him.   Source: I'm a masochist who streamed Plumlee a bunch in fantasy last year so I watched a painful amount of his games."
Tbf Mason Plumlee is actually a very solid center and was a great backup next to Jokic last year
the league should just be 30 teams entirely comprised of classy Mason Plumlee... perfectly balanced!!
I said.. so basically a black player.. I never see anyone offer up Myers Leonard or Mason Plumlee to play next to Zion
You might be thinking of Mason Plumlee
The disrespect to Mason Plumlee smh
Mason Plumlee is a starting NBA center
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
In terms of overall talent we aren’t as bad as those teams.  We still have Ross and Birch who are rotation players on playoff teams and James Ennis is a solid 3 and d bench player.  The Piston have Grant and Bey and maybe Mason Plumlee if you squint.
Get rid of Nurkic? Nurkic is an incredible value at $13M and their defense is wildly better when he's on the court. The trade CJ convo is obviously valid and has been a point of contention for years. But how do the Blazers get better by trading Nurkic?   Trading Mason Plumlee and a 2nd for Nurkic and a 1st might be the best move of Olshey's career in Portland.
I’ll try for our team:  • Jerami Grant • Mason Plumlee • Saddiq Bey • Isaiah Stewart • Wayne Ellington • Dennis Smith Jr. • Saben Lee • Josh Jackson • Frank Jackson • Rodney Mcgruder

"If there's a guy that can make Mason Plumlee look like a good basketball player, it's James Harden.  That being said, I've never been a fan of Plumlee."
S^h^h^h^hhhhh ^^^^Mason ^^^^Plumlee

For some reason I just don't like Mason Plumlee at all
Turns out having Mason Plumlee as your point forward may not be a winning strategy
"Well you seemed convinced as to what the answer is already, but I just want to let it sink in that Mason Plumlee makes more FG’s per game within 3-feet than Embiid."
"Ineptitude? The Hornets were scrappy and got two steals, and Miles Bridges got blocked by 6'11 Olympic gold medalist Mason Plumlee. Just hating for no reason."
\#54   Mason Plumlee was the #1 Volleyball player coming out of high school.
Cody Zeller and Mason Plumlee
"Why are javal McGee, Dwight Howard, and mason plumlee on this list but ja morant and deaaron fox aren’t?"
This is cap. Dwight Howard averaged .88 PPP on post ups in 2011-2012. That would rank him 41st out of 57 players in the league today who average 1 or more post ups per game this season. That's the same PPP on post ups as Mason Plumlee.    He was not a good post player ever by any stretch of the imagination.
"This may be the homer in me, but I think Rozier is a pretty big snub as well. He probably doesn't make it because of how deep the guards are, but Mason Plumlee is on there for god's sake."
And Blake and Deandre and Mason Plumlee...
Mason Plumlee? Good lord.
"You guys can tell me if I’m being a homer here, but how are Derrick White, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard, and John Wall on this list and Ja Morant isn’t? How the fuck does that make sense?"
"My man Mason Plumlee still getting love, I'm here for it"
"**TEAM LUNCH PAIL**  Fueled by the hype from his 10 steal game, the NBA greenlights a lunch pail team that consists primarily of T.J. McConnell clones. Sure enough, the gym can't open SOON ENOUGH for these plucky vets. According to reports, they're each in there every morning by 3 A.M.  Unfortunately, the team had a stroke of bad luck when their request for a Plumlee led them to Marshall Plumlee, arguably the worst of the bunch (albeit plucky and hard working.) Unlike brother Mason, Marshall doesn't possess enough skill or speed to compete with the top centers in the league.  As a result, opponents take advantage of team Lunch Pail's limitations inside, scoring often in the paint. McConnell + McConnell + McConnell + McConnell proves to be scrappy enough to stay in most games and even beat a few tanking teams, but ultimately the talent deficit leads to a disappointing 12-70 record."
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven’t seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I’m not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we’ve played a lot better than our record so I’m optimistic for the first time in a long time."
"Mason Plumlee  Saddiq Bey  Josh Jackson  Saban Lee  Actually committing to a rebuild instead of perpetually drafting 12th  Delon Wright(grabbed them a few seconds)  Derrick Rose (grabbed them a young prospect and a second)  Isaiah Stewart   They have been shitty but competitive, one of the most enjoyble rebuilds in the league rn"
"&gt; a slight overpay for a starting caliber center  It's an extreme overpay for a traditional big. Centers who don't shoot 3s and can't defend on the perimeter are of extremely limited value in today's NBA. If all you want is a big dude who can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots, there's no need to pay that kind of money to get a player like that. Look at what guys like Ivicia Zubac, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard or Nerlens Noel are making: combined they are making $8 million less than Steven Adams is making by himself this season."
"No, that’s Mason Plumlee"
"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
"If advanced stats rank Russ below Mason Plumlee on offense, I think there’s a problem."
Ya but mason Plumlee tho
"I know Lakers fans don’t want to hear it but this is a rivalry. Obviously a one eyed little step brother v massive rock star older brother rivalry but still. 2 WCF matchups in the last 11 years with lots of weird end of game fuckups(Kenyon Martin inbound pass, Mason Plumlee blown coverage on AD). This game makes it feel more salt and I’m here for it."
Mason Plumlee
"Sure, why not, I'm down to see what Mason Plumlee [can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CcYa8APIDE) as the primary ballhandler."
Yes I would trade Mason Plumlee for Ben Simmons
Nobody missing fuckin Mason Plumlee
"&gt;Jokic getting subbed out for single defensive possessions when the team had time outs means absolutely nothing, that’s not what being played off the court means, and it’s something a lot of teams do in those situations when they have the personnel  I'll agree that it's not what being played off the court means, but disagree that it means nothing. It means that Malone thought Mason Plumlee was a good bit better defensively than Jokic. Mason Plumlee is a solid defensive player but he's not known as a stud or anything. If Jokic was a good enough defender, he doesn't get taken off the floor.  I know lots of teams do that, the Sixers do it pretty often this year swapping Thybulle in for Curry. Curry's a below average defender and Thybulle is great so it makes sense. Don't see how it ""means absolutely nothing"" when it very obviously means you would rather have someone else out there for defense.  The Sixers don't take out Simmons for offensive possessions in close games, doesn't happen."
I mean if it goes to like...Mason Plumlee then yeah he would be getting robbed.  But not if it goes to Simmons or Bam.
"Mason Plumlee is almost averaging a double-double and has had two triple doubles this year while shooting over 60%.  Granted the Pistons suck, but dude is having his best season in his 8th year, and showing the motivation to keep improving."
"&gt;Mason Plumlee - Plumdog Millionaire  My personal favorite for him is ""ol' T-Rex arms mason plumlee"""
Yeah man we’re definitely beating the Heatles 2nd round with our STACKED roster + mason plumlee

Mason plumlee learned a lot from jokic
"I don’t agree at all, Pistons aren’t good enough to not go BPA, and Mason Plumlee isn’t someone you change course over. Pistons need help all over."
Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee weren't even playing tonight :'(
He sat Tim Duncan out in the NBA finals for defense  He chose Mason Plumlee over Bam Adebayo for Team USA then lost with the dream team
I will give you a mason plumlee and a second
"&gt;Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...? Man   You just listed quite a few terrific players. Would be by far the best best in the league"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."

I dont even watch basketball and im 100% confident at least half the teams in march madness would beat this pistons team. I would rather let crows pick my fucking eyes out peck by peck than ever watch mason plumlee again lmfao.
"Callin it, Mason Plumlee FT to win the game"
"Mason Plumlee and Mason Plumlee is a deadly duo tho, twin towers at its finest."
Mason Plumlee so good he played twice
Mason Plumlee unfortunately 😞
Mason Plumlee from down unda
"Best, worst doesn’t matter. Mason Plumlee arrives all the same"
Mason Plumlee is T-Rex Gang
"Isaiah Jackson to the Hornets? We'll see.   They need to move from Zeller &amp; Biyombo that's for sure.  I don't even remember why Zeller was the 4th Pick from the beginning, but it's amazing to me how being a lottery pick guarantees that you have a 7-8 year career in the league at least. How that guy has been in Charlotte this whole time while more talented bigs like Mason Plumlee have bounced around from team to team is beyond me."
The 2013 Nets would be one of the best teams ever lol  Deron Williams/Jason Terry/Shaun Livingston  Joe Johnson/Marcus Thornton/Marquis Teague  Paul Pierce/Mirza Teletovic/Alan Anderson   Kevin Garnett/Andrei Kirilenko/Andray Blatche/Reggie Evans  Brook Lopez/Mason Plumlee/Jason Collins  The worst player in the starting line up for this team is the all time leading scorer for the Nets lol
So you can give Mason Plumlee more money?
"Jamal wasn't the only problem for the Nuggets. They also lost key guys in the offseason like Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and the other guy I can't remember his name. Grant really came into his own last year and Plumlee was a solid player for them. Gordon and the Rise of Michael Porter didn't nearly made up for those guys."
Mason Plumlee over Duncan IMO
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"For a long time, I truly believe that Terry Stotts was a huge part of our success, and helped us win playoff games that, based on roster talent, we had no business winning. However, I think his system and his basketball philosophy got passed up by the league. When he started with us he was way more forward thinking about shot selection, taking 3's, and forcing opponents to take midrangers than most coaches in the league, but now that's just standard across the league and he hasn't innovated further.  This year's blazer's team is the most talented we've had since Aldridge left. We won playoff games starting Mason Plumlee, Mo Harkless, and Aminu at the same time. The fact we couldn't even take an injured Nuggets squad to 7 games with this squad is a sign that we're not getting the most out of our players. We were horribly inconsistent the whole year, and no matter the roster construction, there really isn't an excuse for being 29th in defense this year, that's just putrid.  He's still a better coach than some. Maybe with some new scenery he'll find a new formula and do well again. I honestly hope he does, because he is genuinely a good human being."
"In terms of overall talent that team is not close to third string, I mean Mason Plumlee was on it"
"The Suns would be a title favourite. In this hypothetical, the Suns use their resources to get a center instead of CP3. No Ayton slander but center, in general, is the easiest position to fill in NBA. Clint Capela was gettable. Myles Turner. Ibaka. Steven Adams. Derrick Favours. Christian Wood. Valanciunas.  Even lower-tier centers like Mason Plumlee would probably be fine on this team, and use those resources to get another wing or playmaker.  I think you can find someone that does 50-75% of what Ayton does fairly easily for his role on this team.  I think you have to look at it from the perspective that they used resources on CP3 because the team needed a lead ballhandler and more permitter scoring and playmaking. Luka is still on his rookie deal so those resources can be used in a lot of different places.  And, of course, there is the obvious. Luka is a significantly better player than Ayton. Anyone who says Ayton is really overthinking it. Luka is on his way to his second first All-NBA team. If I had to bet right now. I would take the under on Ayton ever making a first All-NBA team. That doesn't mean he's bad, but barring a big jump he is significantly below AD, Jokic, Embiid and Gobert in the second tier with Capela and Bam."
"Animation manager: ""Hiro, I keep telling you, that's not what Americans look like!""  Hiro: ""Oh yeah? What about that guy?"" *points at Mason Plumlee  Manager: ""......."""
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
" Our bigs last time were Prime Boogie, Prime Draymond (fresh off a historical Game 7 loss), a start-of-his-decline Deandre Jordan, and Mason ""Olympic Melo"" Plumlee.  This time, it's inept scorer Draymond, declined Deandre Jordan, and a wiser Mason ""Olympic Melo"" Plumlee. lmfao hopefully Zion can guard the eastern euro 7 footers.    Just gotta find someone who's gonna guard jokic for Serbia and Patty/Ben/Jingles and co. for Australia"
nO ..not even close to a fair trade. CJ is not worth Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee.
Death taxes and Mason Plumlee on team USA.
"Hear me out guys - Porzingis for Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee.  Mavs get out from that ridiculous contract and bring in two front court pieces to supplement Luka’s game.  They get a second/third option scorer who plays really well.  Detroit gets star power and a guy who is practically all upside for them.  If he works out, they have a top 20 player in his prime.  If he doesn’t, they weren’t planning on competing for 3 years anyway.   I want this trade to happen really badly."
"I once heard Mason Plumlee described as “sneaky athletic.” The dude is 6’11”, has a massive head, and can jump really well. What part of any of that is sneaky?"
A lot of them were traded away  We picked Ronde Hollis Jefferson in 2015 who was traded for Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton who we developed into an NBA player  Didn’t have one in 16 I don’t think   2017. We picked Zach Collins at 10 and Caleb Swannigan in the late 20s which considering the talent available in our range in that draft is a franchise altering disaster   18 we picked Anfernee Simons at 24 or 26 which was a good pick  19 we picked Nas Little who has shown flashes of being good but needs time  20 we didn’t have a pick
Frank Kaminsky  Cody Zeller  Wily Hernangomez  Goga Bitadze  Mason Plumlee
"On the Nuggets he wasn't. Just like Mason Plumlee starts for Pistons now, but was role player for Nuggets. Because there was **a better player** than him on that team.   What the fuck are you talking about, Jokic didn't bench him. If player A outplays player B and crown knows it, player A did not bench player B. Benching him behind Jokic is not honest? WHAT?! Do you REALLY think that they didn't make him aware that if (more like *when*) a better player comes by, he would get benched?! Jesus Christ.  You din't have to be an All star to have to right to save the career, but you have to be an All Star or more than that to make demands. And one player expecting to have a guaranteed starting spot sure sounds like a fucking demand. Nurkic didn't have the cards to play that game. And he lost. Expectedly for every one but him. He played for goodnes sake, what drugs are you on? Didn't they try Balkan Twin tower shit, what proved that Jokic can't and more like shouldn't play at PF?! Were you even watching NBA then?! And when Malone realised that Jokic is more effective as a C and Nurkic can't play PF to save his life, therefore made Nurkic come of bench, the very next week Nurkic started complaining. And he continued to do that, and would you guess that that type of shit wares off team chemistry. Malone wanted no part of that and basically cut him, which is his right as a coach. Tim Connely stood behind that decision.    Yes, Nuggets ruined Nurkics life, they killed half of his family and threatened to kill other half too. I never blamed Nurkic for asking a trade, I blamed him for acting like a damn bitch after he got traded. You have to be petty with petty people like Nurkic is, because as I said, he continued with petty shit after he got traded.   &gt;As if what you did to him wasn't enough.  I did nothing to him. Nuggets did nothing to him except finding him a great home. He OWES the Nuggets for his situation. Pairing him with Damian Lillard and making him look somewhat good. Nuggets would be bottom feeder if they traded Jokic instead of Nurkic. No one wants to be the bottom feeder."
Serious question  OP do you really think anyone gives a fuck about the Olympics?   There is such a lack of players who give a fuck that the 2019 team included:  Harrison Barnes Mason Plumlee Brook Lopez Derrick White and Marcus Smart
"You are absolutely not getting anywhere near 70% of the production of what Ayton gives the Suns, especially what he's given them this series to be 1 game away from booting the defending champs out of the first round, on BOTH ends of the floor... for only $10 million annually lmaoooooooo. I understand centers are the running backs of the NBA in casual fans eyes today and y'all think every one of them that isn't Jokic is trash and expendable... but no dude. You can get a bum like Aron Baynes or a roleplayer like Mason Plumlee for $10 million or under annually... you are not getting the anchor for the #2 seed in the West's defense or a guy who can punk someone of AD's caliber in the playoffs like Ayton did for that chump change, no chance in hell."
Mason Plumlee
"to be fair, the olympic team has picked mason plumlee, so it’s not purely based on talent lol"
"Healthy Timelord is the perfect complimentary piece the Jays need. He defends, he is efficient, and he moves the ball.   Basically the C's need those 3 things in a player. Cheap examples of this could be guys like Mason Plumlee, Royce O'Neal, Jae Crowder, or Kelly Olynyk."
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"AD, Harden, Steph, Klay, Drose, and Mason MF Plumlee. Of course they lost."
"Him, Mason Plumlee, or Reddick."
Giles is BBQ chicken for Mason Plumlee. Jokic could inhale Giles like a whale eating krill without even noticing
You mean they wouldn't have traded us Jokic for Mason Plumlee? Lol.

"Rooting for the Nuggets fucks you up a little where you just starting expecting tips to go in  Like, no, actually most centers just spike it off the backboard in that situation. In retrospect I may have been unfair to Mason Plumlee"
He's the new Mason Plumlee.
KP looking like mason plumlee
"Steven Adams, Andre Drummond, Cody Zeller, Mason Plumlee. Those kinds of guys are overhated because they don’t fit mainstream conventions of what a basketball fan thinks makes a good center. Fact is that they come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Not every good center is a floor spacer, efficient scorer, or switchable defender. That said, that does not make them bad players because they all have pretty great talent, it’s just not as visible as it would be with a center who fits into the modern paradigm."
It also just occured to me that Mason Plumlee might not win mvp :-(
"Guys like Nerlens Noel, Mason Plumlee, Derrick Favours, D. Howard were all relatively cheap and available unrestricted free agents. Warriors were better off taking one of those guys than drafting a young raw project."
"You're right, the Wizards should have paid $80m to Mason Plumlee instead"
"Bro fr. I got a lot of friends who are raps fans but man a lot of the people online just have a victim complex as if Adam silver hates Canada. I went on there a couple months ago when they had a mock trade, Baynes + Terrence Davis for mason plumlee. All the raps fans saying “hell no plumlee is trash, can’t believe Detroit’s shitty FO gave plumlee 8 mil/ year, masai would never do that” word for word. They literally are paying Baynes 6 per year 😭. I’m Canadian so I hate how a huge portion of the raps fans nowadays are delusional and don’t even know anything about the Calderon, Bargnani primo pasta days"
LaMelo and Bridges have 12 alley-oop connections. This is surprisingly low to me. Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee have more (15)! Guess it's quality over quantity for them!
Mason Plumlee and Nikola Jokic
Pretty sure it was Mason Plumlee.
"Jazz fans, what are you willing to attach to Favors to turn him into Mason Plumlee?"
"I will make the list of Bucks players who died for this:  Michael Redd, Thon Maker, John Henson, Brandon Jennings, Jabari Parker, Mo Williams, Monta Ellis, Andrew Bogut, Charlie Bell, Desmond Mason, Whatever Plumlee they gave a big contract to."
They turned Mason Plumlee into Nurk AND a first round pick
Could’ve sworn mason Plumlee went in 2012
Mason Plumlee was on the world cup roster IIRC
I'm really confused how Mason plumlee made the world cup teams in 14 and 18 and can't even get a pity invite over McGee for the Olympics... That dude got played. If I'm him I'm blocking team USA on my phone. You can't give him an Olympic shot after 2 world cups? 😂
"Delon Wright was traded at the deadline,  the likely starting lineup will be  Hayes Cunningham Bey Grant Stewart   with a mix off the bench of: mason plumlee, saben lee, josh/frank jackson, and a likely late first rounder as the pistons will probably try to trade back up with their 3 seconds"
Myles turner probably dont want to risk getting injured again after a long injury. Jarret allen is RFA. I thought they will call mason plumlee or wood but javale is a suprise.
Mason Plumlee was better than KLove this year.
Isn't myles turner sidelined for an entire season? I don't think calling a player that has been sidelined for a long time to play on a different rule is good idea.   Jarett allen is RFA and don't want to injure himself while idk about christian wood but there are rumour about him rejecting the invitation  I thought they will call mason plumlee lmao
[https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/shot-chart-mason-plumlee](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/shot-chart-mason-plumlee)  also watched atleast 40 pistons games last year

Mason Plumlee
"Mason plumlee is good, fantasy legend bro"
We are dangerously close to Mason Plumlee making the flight on merit
You mean Mason Plumlee
"Save us, Mason Plumlee"
Mason Plumlee it is then
It’s Mason Plumlee Time
Mason Plumlee and a 2nd or no deal
"Yo, mason plumlee"
"Pop subbed Bam for Mason Plumlee too, he isn’t exactly the greatest talent evaluator when it comes to the olympics"
"Pop replaced bam with mason plumlee during FIBA, bam said he didnt deserve it then, but it gave him the fire to make it next time, and pop said he wishes he did things differently to show him what bam was going to be. If trae isnt a toddler he would have the right mindset to go back in it."
So it’s Mason Plumlee time? Right?
And Mason Plumlee while there at it
*Mason Plumlee
Mason Plumlee?
I almost dated a girl whose friend got flown out by Mason Plumlee and whose ex played against Zion Williamson
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team’s best player is Kevin Durant."
"Not always -  there have always been a couple role players on the rosters. Kirk Hinrich, Shane Battier, Tyson Chandler, Kenneth Faried and Mason Plumlee have all played big roles over the years.    But in any case, I don't agree that this year's roster lacks role players. Draymond and Bam are definitely role players - they're just really, really good role players. Jerami Grant has become a scorer, but he was viewed as a 3-and-D wing only 1 year ago. Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday have spent plenty of time in complementary roles in their day."
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
"I mean, there are plenty of energy bigs who can do the ""block shot, get rebound, set screen, get out of the way"" thing. Basically just do a B-/C+ Tyson Chandler impression. Personally I think it would have been funny to send Time Lord to Tokyo, just to see what might happen.  We ought to consider that Colangelo/Krzyzewski/Popovich/whoever else is responsible for these selections communicated some kind of strategic intention or preference when they invited Love. They aren't just picking names out of a hat, there's *some* reason for that decision, however much we all disagree with it. The only plausible basketball reasons I could come up with were shooting, and a history with USA Basketball. That's why I keyed in on Myles Turner, who might be the only player who fits the profile and is eligible to represent the United States.  It really illustrates what a crazy situation this is. More broadly, we're living through this renaissance of skilled big men, you almost can't turn on an NBA game without seeing a seven-footer doing something borderline superhuman, and *NONE* of them are American/eligible to play for Team USA. (Kevin Durant doesn't count, he's 6'13"".) Instead we've got folks in this thread making full-throated endorsements for Jarrett Allen, Mason Plumlee, Brook and Robin(?) Lopez... Jarrett Allen will never in his life be even a tiny fraction of the player that Embiid, Jokic, or Gobert are. Shit, Nic Vucevic would dominate just about every American big.  Maybe it's a good thing though. Up to this point Team USA has really only been capable of doing one of two things: steamrolling everyone, or flaming out in a colossal disappointment. This is one of several major indicators that moving forward, international basketball competition might actually be a fair fight."
Mason plumlee would be perfect
Kevin Love is not great. I’d rather have current Robin Lopez or Mason Plumlee over this version of Kevin Love
Exactly. There’s a reason Mason Plumlee made the national team. Team USA needs guys who can be productive if they don’t have plays drawn up for them or the ball isn’t in their hands.
"Love brings Olympic experience.   Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andre Drummond, Mason Plumlee, etc...  That’s the quality you would get in Kevin Loves spot. Draymond is the only player better than Love on that list currently, but even in 2016, Love was a better player than Draymond."
"Lmao you need to chill. Nobody was going to that World Cup. We had to bring Mason Plumlee ffs. And this field trip for Keldon is to Vegas, so let’s take it down a notch. He’s not going to Tokyo."
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"&gt;Mason Plumlee  He would be 5x better than Love, he can atleast rebound and pass out of the post."
"It was between Love, Duncan Robinson, Mason Plumlee, and Apex Caruso. Not a lot of options."
"Probably worse? Bruh it’s obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
max player mason plumlee
The hornets had vets. Rozier closed games and they were good with Hayward (tanked after he got hurt).  The pistons have jerami grant and mason plumlee LOL
Mason Plumlee would be a huge get for them

What the Nuggets need is Mason Plumlee NRG
You mean Mason Plumlee and his sidekick Cade Cunningham
out of principle ive much rather seen mason plumlee back at it
How about Mason Plumlee?
You got it. Turns out he's a big fan of Mason Plumlee.
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"

"The difference is that WC team had their 4th-5th choices for the majority of the slots. No offence to Derrick White and Mason Plumlee, but they’re not exactly on the same level as Lillard and Adebayo. There’s like 4 players from that WC team that would get on this Olympic team and even then only 2 of them would probably get extended minutes.  Imagine any other national team having to forego even their first options for the starting five, probably couldn’t even qualify.   (Still not sure wth Love is doing on this team tho lol)"

he’s an unclassy player. He’s not a gym rat like frank kominsky or mason plumlee
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
jalen rose not that good anymore called kevin love tokenism ws wild. love fits way better for team usa than julius randle. pick and pop 3. juluis would need the ball more in his hands to be effective.if it was mason plumlee sure i would agree but kevin love was a quality player and still be serviceable in 10 minutes
"I mean he isn’t wrong, it’s the same reason why Mason plumlee was on team USA before as well"
Yeah like Mason Plumlee! Heh
"Go get Jeremy Grant and Mason Plumlee for Powell, Jones Jr, Afrenee Simons and Little or 1st.   Best of both worlds if there is no available upgrade for CJ"
Four years ago Bam Adebayo was not BAM ADEBAYO and Mason Plumlee was a decent role player for the Nuggets.
"I’d rather the Warriors try to package both picks and Wiggins to get Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee or something. Why trade Wiggins for someone in a bigger contract, when you could get two contributors? They need depth."
Mason plumlee
I mean Mason Plumlee sorta chugged along for the ride for years.
Lou Williams is Nate McMillan's version of Mike Malone's Mason Plumlee.
mason plumlee oughta do it
"2018? Do you mean the World Cup in 2019? That team had Derrick White, Joe Harris and Mason Plumlee getting minutes. Taking out Kevin Love, everyone else on the Olympic team is an All-Star caliber player at minimum."
"Lmao this roster is night and day from the 2019 roster! That roster featured a bunch of role players and borderline all-stars. They only had two real “stars” with Tatum and Mitchell. This year they are already led by Durant and Lillard, then Beal/Tatum/Booker as clear stars, and finally the rest of the guys are at least borderline all-star players. Definitely not the strongest team fielded but way stronger than whatever the hell it was they put together in 2019. I mean that team had Marcus Smart, Brooke Lopez, Joe Harris, and fucking Mason Plumlee! I don’t know how you could even compare this year’s roster to that other team."
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don’t have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn’t in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we’d be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it’d also depend on who else is taken. I don’t believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"Mason plumlee, such a waste of talent."
Mason Plumlee
No mason plumlee?
Where's Mason Plumlee?
"That team was flawed and just not very deep. That team also had Derrick White, Joe Harris and Mason Plumlee on it. If you would've taken two of those guys off and replaced them with Durant and Dame that probably changes things significantly. That team didn't have *The Guy*"
"all it takes is 1 team.  I mean, consider that guys like Mason Plumlee make &gt;$8M/year, or Derrick Jones Jr. who makes $10M/year.  Cam Payne has to get significantly more than that.  It's risky, I think there's a solid range of outcomes where whoever signs him regrets the deal, but he's an ascendant player entering his prime years and he's getting buckets efficiently on the biggest of stages.  He's getting a bag this summer."
"Pistons rested guys like Mason Plumlee lol, you guys shut Horford down for the season and I wouldn't be surprised if SGA was prematurely shut down too."
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."
BAHGAWD THAT'S MASON PLUMLEE.. WHAT'S HE DOING ON TOP OF THE ROSTER LIST???
"But, where is Mason Plumlee?"
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
*Mason Plumlee comes in with the Kurt Angle music*
It's reserved for Mason Plumlee.
"Plumlee is cheaper too. And for all the clowning people give the Plumlee bothers, I remember being shocked at seeing Mason in the Blazers - Warriors series.  They way people talk it seemed like he's just be a walking turnover and non-factor on defense.  But no, he could rebound and pass like your everyday big man!  So ya, I don't really get why people hate on him so much."
"Rather have Turner on the team, but I guess Love’s better than Mason Plumlee"
Mason Plumlee big ball 2
"Stotts was the mastermind behind the offense run by Dallas on their way to the championship in 2011. He had us in contention with Lamarcus before Matthews went down with the achilles injury.       He's also turned Mason Plumlee from athletic rim runner into a top of the key playmaker, same with Nurkic and even Melo improved his passing in our system.  He just adapted because Dame became first option."
I can; see Mason Plumlee pick himself in the final seconds of I think game 5 or 6 of the western conference finals last year against the Lakers. One of the fines dumbest things you'll ever see in basketball and of course it's from today's game.
"I think the last thing the Nets need is another injury-prone player like Turner who played only 47 games this season. Plus, Turner is getting paid $18m/yr, I wonder if they could trade for someone like Mason Plumlee instead who is only $8m/yr."
Mason Plumlee is the go to guy for USA basketball to call I guess
It’s not that it’s boring. I find it entertaining. The chants and everything. The reactions from opposing players. It’s just proof he’s the most protected player in NBA history.   Mason Plumlee isn’t getting 21 seconds at the line
I cant believe Mason Plumlee made the team. About time.
"I don’t know if you know this, but the USA never sends its best players to the FIBA world cup. At best they get some younger stars in there. Mason Plumlee, Joe Harris and Derrick White we’re literally on the 2019 roster. So i think you’re the one who needs to pay more attention lmfao."
"I remember seeing him in the dunk contest in 2015 and being like  ""This kid sucks.""  Cause he missed all of his first round dunks and the second round one was mediocre. And Zach Lavine was throwing up Vince level dunks between Mason Plumlee and Victor Oladipo."
Whichever team has Mason Plumlee wins.
Mason plumlee is a fuckin gamer
Watch them give Mason Plumlee a spot again
Mason Plumlee for one.
"When Durant stops I think his toes are touching mason plumlees on the block, plumlee is what 6’11-7ft and has his arms straight up   That is absurd"
Mason Plumlee
why would the nba market players that aren’t top 20? we’re not tuning in to see mason plumlee play
"KD and steph are still top tier shooters, but KD just has to deal with the defenders being his height, so steph wins that one since he's used to lobbing it from behind 4 defenders  defenders are gonna thrive because instead of having to defend big dudes and small dudes they're defending the same size as them which will mean a one size fits all approach will suddenly become a lot easier even if it's not 100% effective.  giannis will suck.  lebron is a year younger but suddenly losing his decades of strength. he does have that bbiq though, and his shooting is still there, so he'll be dope.  i immediately thought kyrie would thrive because he's suddenly got everyone the same size as him and he's still got that elite finishing and the best handles i ever saw, but after writing about the other players i wonder if he'd actually suck a bit because he doesn't have awkward big guys to get around? i think his handles win  mason plumlee still sucks  portland still won't trade dame for ben simmons  kawhi's gonna have hands twice the size of his head lmao"
My strategy would be to have a team of only lumbering centres. They will lose almost every game but there’s gonna be one night where a team doesn’t have the big bodies it needs and just gets beat up enough to lose.  PG: Mason Plumlee SG: Alex Len SF: Boogie PF: Robin Lopez C: DeAndre Jordan
100th in the NBA in assists per g per 36 minutes.   He's behind Mason Plumlee.
"Now that I think about it, I’m pretty sure we got Howard by trading away Miles Plumlee and Marco Belinelli. The whole thing was a disaster.   1.	We traded a relatively valuable FRP for Belinelli in a desperation move to scrape into the 8 seed, so that we could be swept.  2.	In another “win now” move we panicked and traded the cheap contracts of Spencer Hawes and Roy Hibbert for the terrible contract of Miles Plumlee 3.	Stuck with Plumlee’s terrible contract, we took the only deal we could find to unload him, which was to take Dwight Howard who fit terribly with our team. We also got the #31 pick in the deal, but we traded it for cash considerations and a low second rounder  The entire end of the Cho regime was just a non-stop fight to reach the 8 seed, where we kept making worse and worse decisions to try to salvage the other terrible decisions we made in the past.   The whole situations made me feel really anxious about trading for another Plumlee this offseason, lol. Luckily, Mason is better than his brother and on a much cheaper deal. All the other moves we made were with an eye towards the future too."
"Outside of the Antetokoumpo family, I don’t think it’s about diplomacy. I think it’s more about people believing those other guys could have some talent or physical ability close to their brothers/father, and they gotta prove it. For every example you said there’s many more of relatives than never got a chance or a contract, or not even 5 games on the NBA because they were not NBA players. David Stockton, Ralph Samson III, Glen Rice Jr, Drew Barry, Mychel Thompson, Patrick Ewing Jr, Shawn Kemp Jr, where’s the diplomacy with them?   Why would people go for diplomacy with Plumlee, Zeller, Gary Payton? What are they getting out of it? I don’t really get it from that diplomacy point of view, nobody is salivating to get Mason or Cody. Tyler and Miles got contracts because they showed something, both of them had at least one decent year at an NBA level. Gelo gotta prove something to get one.   You think Lamelo would go to a team that gave his brother a chance over going to a team that can pay him the max or give him the best chance of winning?"
is this like how one of the Zellers and Plumlee's was always getting a contract because Cody Zeller and Mason Plumlee were starter level players?
"because they only stopped paying Josh Smith this last year?  Because they signed Mason Plumlee, who they absolutely didn't need, to a deal nobody else was giving him and then had to attach a pick to dump him this offseason?  The Joe Dumars era ended pretty poorly and it's been rocky ever since.  They're obviously not the Lions or in the Wolves/Kings/Magic tier of sad NBA franchises, but they're closer to those teams than they are to contenders."
"that one is more justifiable than paying Mason Plumlee was last year, I am skeptical that anyone else in the NBA was rushing to pay Olynyk $12+M/year and give him 3 years.  I guess if he's the 3rd big in the rotation behind Grant &amp; Beef Stew that's something but it's an overpay for a team that likely didn't need to do it."
"To be fair, some of our guys from last year forgot we already have Cade and didn’t have to sell. They thought Luka was our tank commander from last year, Mason Plumlee. It happens"
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
"The Hornets can offer a S&amp;T for about $13M if Mason Plumlee is going out.  on top, I think the Hornets can offer the lottery protected NOLA 1st but that's about it."
"Is it? They suffered with the injury bug a lot last year and came close to making the playoffs. Mason Plumlee is also a good addition. LaMelo hopefully plays the entire season and gets better. Also possible development with Bridges, Washington, etc.  I’m not a big Oubre guy but he is just added depth to their wing core."
If Cousins stayed healthy. Mason Plumlee if he gets a bigger role.
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"I'm not going to go through the entire list of starting centers but I mentioned in another comment that probably the most average starting center you can get away with is Mason Plumlee who's making like 8M a year which is a lot more than almost nothing. There's obviously going to be a few players below that line, but a lot less than bottom half."
Honestly Mason Plumlee or Dwight Powell come to mind and they both make around 8-11M a year iirc.
mason plumlee for kawhi leonard
"Charlotte got their token white big, it’s Mason Plumlee"
Mason Plumlee almost got 80mil I think? Oh he deserved a Max alright.
Feel free to leave KD at home next olympics then.  Send Mason Plumlee instead.
"Yeah I guess I just wasn't wowed by the Miles Plumlee move. Technically an improvement but I thought you could do better.  Edit: oh wait, you got Mason, not Miles lmao"
"Amile played a lot of 5, though, as part of smaller lineups because Duke didn't have ""superbigs"" for most of his career.   As a frosh in '13 he played sparingly off the bench behind the likes of Mason Plumlee and in '15 Duke had Okafor (though he was the first interior guy off the bench and played plenty). But in '14 and '17 he was their biggest guy ahead of Marshall Plumlee or Harry Giles, who barely played. '16 is when he was injured.  Surely he could have developed something more to his offensive game if he was somewhere that needed him to, but if you've seen him dribble or move around enough within an offense you've seen his severe limitations in those regards. He was never going to develop to be Cunningham facing the basket."
"Only so much you can do when Mason Plumlee is a rotational player    The rest of the world takes FIBA much more seriously than the US players do. Compare a US FIBA roster to a US olympics roster. You don’t get the same caliber player.    Pops a coach, not a magician."
"Jarrett Allen, mason plumlee, Myles turner???None of these guys were available???"
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
Mason Plumlee would help this team a lot. Dude learned passing from Jokic
"You're getting a lot of troll responses, but the Olympic 3x3 was really fun to watch. It's difficult because of the qualification requirements, but if USA Basketball wanted to take the men's 3x3 as seriously as they take the women's 3x3 (and I think they should), then it's definitely possible. Ideally, you'd have one taller point guard (Dejounte is a good pick), and then 2 big wings who are good one-on-one defenders (Harrison Barnes, Mikal Bridges, and Kyle Anderson come to mind), and one mobile big as a roll man who can also guard on the perimeter on switches (John Collins definitely works here, as does someone like Mason Plumlee or Aaron Gordon)."
Your team just traded assets to dump Mason Plumlee man. I would tone down the rhetoric.
I have one Mason Plumlee
"to comply with all the sign and trade rules, there's almost a guarantee that Mason Plumlee + Martin twins are heading out to one of these teams, maybe one or both of Carey and Nick Richards. We do not have a way to acquire both of Oubre and Markkanen using cap space or salary matching from Devonte' Graham S&amp;T unless Markkanen is making less than $8M or something"
Bro we just traded for mason plumlee and drafted A C/PF and you think PJs starting at 5? I almost guarantee Miles is in the starting lineup and both Oubre and PJ come off the bench. Only other scenario I see is PJ starting instead of miles. If not I have no clue what JB is doing.
"I mean we did sit guys like Mason Plumlee and Wayne Ellington and Jerami Grant a lot towards the last 10-15 games of the season. But yeah we still tried to win a lot for most of the year, we just sucked at it"
Could I interest you in mason plumlee
"The Pistons just moved Mason Plumlee on a similar deal to Noel’s. He’s basically on a 2/20 deal, that’s not a problem to move at all.  I’m the most worried about Rose because of his age and injury history, but we can also get out of that by 2023 if worst comes to worst."
"Nah cuz these dudes who couldn’t bench 135 if their lives depended on if be telling me all this fucking advanced stats bullshit, like how you gonna average 17/14 and lead lead the league in blocks and pretend a motherfucker like Mason Plumlee better"
"I think it was an extremely bad decision, they did not extend a Qualifying Offer  Supposedly it was to free up space for Mason Plumlee lmaooo"
"The Pistons currently have 6 ACC players: Wayne Ellington, Jerami Grant, Frank Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, and Dennis Smith"
You could win a ring with Mason Plumlee as the starting C on the Nets
We went all in on signing...Richaun Holmes and immediately struck out. Now we lost our 3 best performers by net rating and only have Bouknight and Mason fucking Plumlee to show for it
actually JT Thor is ours. He's part of that Mason Plumlee to Charlotte deal.  So y'all with have to deal with the Thornets now
Back up fit Mostly but Nuggets had Jokic run PnR with Mason Plumlee before
Where'd Mason Plumlee go? 😛
Mason Plumlee would be whipping ass right now
I’m really just expecting mason plumlee who was a solid player for us for years
"Which statistics? His DFG% at the rim is at Kelly Olynyk and Mason Plumlee levels, that's awful"
"Back when Richard Jefferson was on the Nuggets he did a road tripping podcast with Gary Harris, Mason Plumlee and Will Barton after the trade deadline that season where Barton shares that story...  Highly recommend that episode if you're a nuggets fan or just an average nba fan"
ah yes forgot about that MAXIMUM CALIBER USA basketball team in 2019 which lost b2b games vs france and serbia. legendary 7th place team featuring:  mason plumlee  myles turner  harrison barnes  derrick white  joe harris  some real talent there. and yet they're all still better than kevin love lmfao.  BTW kevin love withdrew from that team.
"Denver and Detroit fans are on an island as the only fans that get that Plumlee is a fantastic backup center, haha.  He's memed cause he's a Plumlee but Mason is a very good backup center that can spot starting minutes too.  And he's fantastic at catching lobs, I think he could work really well in Charlotte."
Possibly losing Zeller but gained Mason Plumlee today.
"We traded for Mason Plumlee earlier today, so we got that covered!"
Charlotte gets a great steal at #11 and this was the best pick they could make at #19. Incredible.  If they didn't acquire Mason Plumlee I'd pick them as the winners of the night.
We traded for Mason Plumlee earlier.
So the Hornets are gonna roll with mason plumlee as their center?
We made a trade and got mason plumlee soo idk wtf we’re gonna do next
Maybe the fact that their best center was Mason Plumlee had something to do with it
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST Mason Plumlee going to the Hornets. Unfortunate as they were a fun team. Good news for Sacramento and keeping Holmes.
"LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, Mason Plumlee.   Jason Preston, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, PJ Washington, Kai Jones."
"Who would win a 3 on 3, Tyler Zeller, Luke Zeller, Cody Zeller vs Marshall Plumlee, Mason Plumlee, and Miles Plumlee"
Mason Plumlee is the most Hornets player ever
I love these fun facts. My favourite used to be that Mason Plumlee (2013 draft) is older than Jrue Holiday (2009 draft)
Mason Plumlee would have been a great addition to the team... thats sad
We had Wood. He didn’t want to be here.  And a guy like Mason Plumlee would have been even worse.
"The point is that they could have better utilized the ~40m of cap space than to sign Favors/Redick/Melli. Even if they just absorbed Crabbe+Iggy, at least they'd have 2-3 extra first round picks right now.   Sure, they needed a center, but they didn't need to spend $18m of cap space on Favors, plus a first round pick and $60m+ on Steven Adams.   You could just get a random run-of-the-mill center like Mason Plumlee for $8m/year. Or even better a budding star like Christian Wood for $13m/year."
"What can Pop do when the 40 of the top American players all flake out on the team in 2019? The only notable roster cut was Bam Adebayo to make room for Mason Plumlee (egregious, yeah yeah).  Here's the [whole list] (https://i.gyazo.com/7ca4f08d4c0157b509462f1ff5e1ea93.png) of guys who didn't go though.  And I get the blowback against picking Keldon Johnson, but he was on the Select team and at least was already with the team when they lost Beal."
Never thought I would be wishing Mason Plumlee was on our Olympic team lmao
"Right, I’m sure a roster with Derrick white, joe Harris, Marcus smart, Harrison Barnes and mason plumlee was the very best they could send. If the best players cared they would be there"
29 teams in NBA : I will trade you mason plumlee and Jeff green for Dame.   29 teams: yes that’s fine  Lakers: I will trade you all of our picks and 6 players for Cj McCollum   29 other teams: hmm idk I don’t think that’s enough might need more here
Dude Kenneth Faried and Mason Plumlee were monsters in the World Cup/Olympics they played in
sorely missed Mason Plumlee
"Because the 2019 roster was even worse? Their best player was Kemba Walker and they were rolling out guys like Mason Plumlee, Brook Lopez, Kyle Kuzma, and Derrick White."
If only we had Mason Plumlee
Mason Plumlee would be more useful than Keldon Johnson for this team
"Because selling all your assets and entire future for pennies on the dollar for a not so perfect upgrade that doesn’t guarantee you a championship is a risky move to make.   There’s no KD level player that’s available. Any trade for a “superstar” requires Wiggins to be included who’s our ONLY wing.   Assuming Dame and Beal are even available, it’s super risky because you have no backcourt defense and you’re asking Klay coming off missing two years an ACL and Achilles injuries to now guard the Lebron, KD, Kawhi’s and PGs of the world…that’s a lot.   Siakam and Turner would be great additions but is the upgrade from Wiggins worth your entire future of Wiseman, two lottery picks and potentially Poole and future picks??   The Warriors championship hopes rely on Klay’s health and ability to bounce back. The Warriors need depth and high IQ role players, not so much a superstar.   But does it really make sense to trade someone like Wiseman for Mason Plumlee?  There are deals to be made to improve the team and Myers and Co. are exploring all options but it’s more tricky than just “do whatever it takes for Steph”.   The Warriors are but they’re smartly not going to act irrationally and dump the cupboard and make a panic move."
"Mason Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee.    Control the glass."
"He's an end of bench high energy guy. He got the slot due to nepotism but it's not like he's a million times worse than the average end of bench guy. He seems to be good for the locker room and, althought it baffled me, did get put in as a defensive replacement during the playoffs. Although it was a bit like the Mason Plumlee defensive replacement the Nuggets used. . . That's decent return for a guy whose there to make your star happy."
Mason Plumlee would fit pretty well. Idk how invested Detroit is in him but I don’t imagine his contract eats up too much space and/or he’d be hard to move
Hi philly you guys want mason Plumlee 😎
Yeah they gave us Nurk and a first for Mason Plumlee. That wasn't a serious debate
What young guys we trading? I’m not giving up Sekou for the 24th pick. Sekou has the exact same potential Kuminga does  Our only trade pieces are Josh Jackson &amp; Mason Plumlee. We ain’t getting shit with them lol
"If we do that it'll probably be because we traded RJ, Randle, and IQ for Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee."
Mason Plumlee owns Lebron
"To be clear I'll rely on one of those metrics the day I doesnt see stuff like :  \- DRPM : Julius Randle, Joe Harris,Duncan Robinson and Jamal Murray in the top 15  \- DWS : Julius Randle, Jokic , Russ and Tobi Harris in the top 15  \- DBPM : Mason Plumlee, washed up Iggy, and TJ McConnell in the top 15 (Won't even mention who is 16th because it's hilarious)  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah for now I'll rely on my eye test, as flawed as it is, it's still better than total BS like that"
"I'm sorry but at a certain point it is crazy for players to be getting 20 mil to be a rotation player. You gotta start using that money to enhance the support networks that allow the NBA to exist, like Arena workers and youth leagues.   Should a Mason Plumlee type player really get 25-30 mil a year while the attendants make 8 buck an hour? Just because technically we can replace the attendant? Come on now, we are better than that especially after years of progressive messaging."
"We're young and have a lack of talent, but I'm feeling optimistic for the future.  LaMelo could be an all star this year, Miles and/or Terry could also be an MIP/ all star sleeper. Hayward still plays at an all star level, he's just very injury prone. Oh yeah and our only playable center is Mason Plumlee, which is actually an upgrade so whoopdy doo.   But even if we play at our most optimistic potential, a healthy Nets is clapping anyone in the east."
"There’s a lot of NBA 7 footers who are more skilled than Giannis. Jokic is more skilled in every facet of the game, just less athletic. KAT and Lopez are better shooters. Mason Plumlee is a more creative passer. AD and Rudy Gobert are better shot blockers despite being less mobile and appearing to not jump as high. Embiid has better footwork and post moves. If I started talking about past players the list of more skilled 7 footers could go on forever.  There’s literally like 3 guys that you could argue are more athletic than Giannis all time.   I think harden is just saying that being one of the most athletic people to ever play basketball makes the game a lot easier to dominate. It’s really not that crazy."
"1) Mason Plumlee. Cody Zeller had a similar effect where he was such an important piece of what we needed, we couldn't afford to have him out. I know Plumlee isn't the sexiest name out there, but he's going to get the job done efficiently and effectively for us at the C position, and I think his impact will be great.   B) Gordon Hayward. Yeah, his injury history sucks, but we're such a different team with him than without. He brings a legit vet presence and calming ""easy bucket"" factor on offense for our young team. You can't deny his production when he's healthy for us."
"Simmons is a mid range god in 2K19. I just finished a gruelling playoff series against the 76ers, it was fucking bullshit. They also turned Embiid into like fucking Mason Plumlee or some shit, just useless"
"Noel, the supposed favorite to go 1st, dropped out of the top 5 altogether (so it's not like only CLE skipped on him). Burke, McCollum, McLemore, Carter-Williams, and Muhammad were all picked later than they were supposed to according to those mock drafts. There were even players picked outside of the lottery like Schroeder and Mason Plumlee that were apparently likely to be picked earlier. And to a smaller extent Oladipo's just good enough for 4th at best, and not as the 2nd overall. The only thing that was somewhat correct in the mocks among the top picks were Otto Porter and Alex Len.  But somehow Bennett dropping to 19th (if we're starting from the ""top 10, maybe top 5"" starting point) is ""bullshit"". In the same draft that had its ""consensus 1st"" leave the top 5. lol"
"Ante ""Mason Plumlee Punching Bag"" Zizic  https://streamable.com/ws5jl"
"The track marks are very good at that height (and he did them in college) but it’s not something that is out of the world for a tall athletic NBA player. The running times are great for that size and with modern training probably better but maybe mid-major D1 to D2 caliber nowadays at best. The 6-6 high jump is probably pre Fosbury flop so maybe add a couple inches to that. Mason Plumlee (who is 6-11) was a 6-8 high jumper in high school, Iggy (who is 6-6) was a 6-11 high jumper.  Wilt was no doubt a freak athlete at 7+ feet but it wouldn’t be completely unmatched in the modern era. He’d be up there with Gobert and Dwight in terms of athleticism/size combo. I think he’d be a 25/15 player given that he was more offensively gifted than either of those two. So still an all timer but not putting up the 50 ppg type stats if you placed him in today’s game"
"I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. You’re absolutely correct.  Jersey #9 is Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and he steps on #8 Jeff Green’s foot right after Mason Plumlee does his fake move and that made him twist his ankle and hobble a bit.  It lasts a split second.  It’s very clear at the 0:24 mark. https://imgur.com/a/A0YzSDq  Unfortunately, a lot of great crossovers and people falling and hobbling are a result of players stepping on other players feet."
"If you were starting a team and could choose between LeChoke James and Mason Plumlee to build around, who would you pick?"
Supposedly it would've been a swap for Mason Plumlee.
"Fuck Mike Malone and fuck Mason Plumlee, wtf are they doing"
Mason Plumlee MVP low BBIQ player :)
Mason Plumlee was also put into the action that the Lakers ran the regular season game earlier when Kuzma hit that game winner. He sucks at switching
"Hahahah Mason Plumlee with an all-time shit switch in the most important moment of a playoff game,, classic."
"Trail Blazers. They've sent us Fat Lever, T.R. Dunn, Will Barton, Mason Plumlee, Linas Kleiza, Andre Miller, and much more over the years"
"I’m as happy as anyone that we’re finally making good moves, but A- gives us too much credit. As soon as I read “Mason Plumlee is an upgrade over Cody Zeller” I know the author doesn’t watch the Hornets.  Edit: unless he means specifically that Mason has fewer injury concerns. In that case, sure."
"KAT’s definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there’s definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don’t know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who’s better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That’s 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I’d put above him but are debatable"
"You do. Your expectation that players can just post someone up is based on superstars like Shaq doing it. Unless it's dump offs, regular big men do not have an easy time abusing mismatches. It's been that way for a while.  We didn't just give the ball to Mason Plumlee every time he got a switch. Even Dwight had issues going against Jason Maxiell."
robin lopez + mason plumlee = brook lopez
"If we remove the intangible outliers and adjust for the league average, Michael Jordan is as good as Mason Plumlee."
"DENVER NUGGETS  PG: D.J. Augustin   SG: Andre Iguodala   SF: Carmelo Anthony   PF: Danilo Gallinari   C: Mason Plumlee  BENCH: Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, JaVale McGee, Trey Lyles, Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant"
Hornets should be lamelo/terry/gordon/miles/pj  with mason plumlee starting on certain nights. Miles and pj are too good to come off the bench and pj as a small ball center worked well for us last yr.
"I’ll eat my own ass if any other team could start Meyers Leonard, Mason Plumlee, and Aminu and still make the fucking playoffs as a 5 seed"
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
"...also, the Hornets at 46 wins? LaMelo is good, but he's not going to have a Luka Doncic level season, is he? He shot their team out of as many wins as he shot them into wins... and if they're relying on Bouknight, and Mason Plumlee and Oubre?? Not a 46 win team at all. I would pick the Bulls over them, for sure, and definitely the Heat."
"[According to brother Mason in 2018](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/11/01/miles-plumlee-hawks-burning-man-unicycle-trae-young), Miles gave himself that nickname:    “Plumlee has long brought joy to others. ‘He’s the self-proclaimed, “Purveyor of Fun,”’ says Mason Plumlee, the Denver Nuggets center and Plumlee’s brother. He has unicycled competitively since his youth. He juggles and plays the trumpet. He finished high school as his class Salutatorian, regularly acing AP Physics exams. ‘He’s very talented,’ Mason says. ‘And whatever he gravitates towards, he’s very good at.’ Even discluding his Burning Man experience, Miles Plumlee may very well be the most interesting man in the NBA.”"
"I can’t believe you think they don’t need Dray, I’ve watched the Warriors a long time and Dray is super critical to them. If you watched that postseason series against the Trail Blazers that one season it tells you everything they need to know. It was pre-KD, Dame played as well as Steph that series and both teams even defended the other’s PG the same way-threw committed doubles to take the ball out of their hands. Well Dame is out there passing to Mason Plumlee on the high screen and roll, and Steph is out there passing to Dray. Everything else was exactly the same, CJ McCollum is a great shooter. But that, along with Dray’s defense, was basically the difference in the series. And the series wasn’t that close."
"2014 Nets in modern day would be nuts.   PG: Deron Williams, Jason Terry, Shaun Livingston   SG: Joe Johnson, Marcus Thornton  SF: Paul Pierce, Teletovic  PF: Andrei Kirilenko, Andrey Blatche, Reggie Evans  C:  Kevin Garnett, Brook Lopez, Mason Plumlee"
"Old Shaq is kinda the cheat code to this: the '09 Suns could run Nash-Dragic-Grant Hill-Amare-Shaq, with Matt Barnes/Barbosa/Jason Richardson/Robin Lopez off the bench (with MVP of my heart Stromile Swift dunking on everyone in garbage time).   Honorable mention: obviously the '11 Mavs won the title, but prime Kidd-Peja-Marion-Dirk-Chandler with Terry/Caron Butler off the bench would be fun.  Other honorable mention: '14 Brooklyn Nets: Deron-Joe Johnson-Pierce-KG-Brook Lopez, with Kirilenko and Mason Plumlee off the bench (and Jason Kidd because I want to include coaches in this hypothetical)"
"I was definitely wrong in that they played more and better together in 17/18, 18/19 than expected so 100% Grant you that. Plus definitely underestimated Nurk’s injury history before the deal.  There’s little else I feel any interest in backing down on per the Mason Plumlee era in Denver so let’s agree to disagree.  Any Celtics decisions you want to argue or do we hate each other by now lol."

Frankly I really don’t care if the ones he’s trying to get involved are Gordon Hayward Kelly oubre and mason plumlee. The only people who I wanted to touch the ball in OT were him and miles so if he’s gonna shoot threes then whatever.

Mason Plumlee briefly dominated us and then quickly allowes us to get back into the game.  I feel like he does that every time I watch him play?
Mason Plumlee is a textbook example of the phrase big for nothing
"If Mason Plumlee 4-peats, is he the GOAT?"
mason plumlee doesn’t guard the perimeter for shit
Mason Plumlee exists
"His name is Mason Plumlee but okay, you just can't appreciate greatness"
Mason Plumlee and Steven Adams.
Yeah I agree. Mason Plumlee is definitely washed
"I honestly think we can go 82-0. I mean, would you look at this team? Let's start with the backcourt. You've got LaMelo ""Lamelon Baller"" Ball staring down Terry ""Scarence Terrence"" Rozier, slicing and dicing NBA defenses. Ish ""Prodigal Son of Charlotte"" Smith, locked in and ready to make defenders cry with his veteran smarts. James ""Bonknight"" Bouknight. Gordon ""Hair Jordan"" Hayward. When was the last time you saw a backcourt like that? And then the frontcourt. My god, it makes me weep tears of pure joy to read off these names. Miles ""Sky Miles"" Bridges. PJ ""The Capitol"" Washington. Mason ""Plumdog Millionaire"" Plumlee. Vernon ""Mount Vernon"" Carey.  And then the bench. Every time I look at this list I have to change my pants. I'm running out of pants. I'm going broke. Cody ""Which Martin is that?"" Martin. Kelly ""T$unami Papi"" Oubre. Thor. McDaniels. Jones. I'm running out of nicknames. Actually I had to go change my pants again. Lakers? They can go to the nursing home. The Hawks can fly off to the glue factory. Orlando has a team? This team doesn't follow the rules. It makes the rules. And they exercise the rule of law over the Eastern Conference. Read my lips, 82-0."
Is Mason the best Plumlee?
Why is Mason Plumlee a point guard?
"Bro Terry's teams over achieved every fucking year except last season and the Pels season  Made the playoffs every season even ones where we were supposed to be trash. Always beat the over/under on team record based off the talent on the team   Making the WCF without Nurk and starting Kanter/ Harkless and Aminu  Fucking making the playoffs with Mason Plumlee, Aminu, Harkless as starters   Terry haters are the stupidest fucking people with no basketball knowledge holy shit, so fucking dumb"

Mason Plumlee
I think you mean a Mason Plumlee and one of 2 Martin brothers very rare
Mason Plumlee deserves some of those paychecks for the opposing C's that he lets have career games.
Our center is mason plumlee
The mason plumlee effect
Never forget the bubble scrims where the Denver Nuggets starting 5 looked like this:   PG: 7'0 Joker SG: 6'8 Jerami Grant SF: 7'2 Bol Bol PF: 6'7 Paul Millsap  C: 6'11 Mason Plumlee
We will give you Nick richards and mason plumlee
I got 2 out of 5 lol. Kelly Olynyk and Mason Plumlee
"I don't see how the offensive gap is 'insanely large'. Kelly averaged three more points than plumlee, but Mason is one of the best passing big men out there."
Yeah. It’s really upsetting that almost nobody acknowledges Mason Plumlee.
This better be the last time Mason Plumlee gets disrespected like this.
Mason Plumlee 3pt leader
"Yeah, why sign Wendell when we could sign Kelly Olynyk &amp; Mason Plumlee back to back offseasons for the same price and dump a Bruce Brown type for literally nothing?"
"I’m sure i’ll get accused of coping here, and that’s okay. I probably am. but people who would be considered starter quality on our team (miles bridges, lamelo ball, mason plumlee, pj washington, and i’m counting bouknight only because hayward, rozier, and kelly oubre were all out) accounted for a total of 82/240 possible minutes on the court. Our leading player in minutes in this game, jalen mcdaniels, is probably our 7th or 8th option on the team right now if not lower. we should have done better for sure, one of the worst games in NBA history is never excusable, but it’s not like this was the hornets best lineup getting destroyed. I’m sad bc it seems like nobody is taking that into account and just jumping straight to thinking we’re gonna be the worst team in the league in a year where a lot of hornets fans, myself included, have been excited to see what the team can do. I know it’s not that serious, but it has definitely been deflating for me personally."
They also have Mason Plumlee who negates all the fun
Mason Plumlee
Clearly Mason Plumlee.
yeah Mason Plumlee is ready to ball this year
Mason Plumlee?
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
Kevon Looney &gt; Mason Plumlee
"Many players shoot 50% from 2. I’ll use the lineup for the Pistons which were the worst team in the league last year.  Mason Plumlee: 63% 2pt / 0% 3pt  Jerami Grant: 47% 2pt / 35% 3pt  Saddiq Bey: 45% 2pt / 38% 3pt  Wayne Ellington: 52% 2pt/ 42% 3pt  Delon Wright: 52% 2pt/ 35% 3pt  Josh Jackson: 49% 2pt/ 30% 3pt  From the Pistons, we see that half the starting lineup shot 50% for 2 pointers. When you factor in drawing fouls, 50% 2 pointers is worth more than 33% 3 pointers as well."
"Dejounte murray, draymond green, mason plumlee, lonzo,"
Not a triple double but Mason Plumlee got a double double with rebounds and assists
"Mason plumlee, Kelly oubre"
You really going to try to argue that Mason Plumlee isn't one of the greatest shooters of all time?
"If I'm voting for someone to represent my professional interests I want the smartest shark available, someone who understands the importance of health, money and social impact if I'm in the NBPA.  ""Catching a guy"" is not an important qualifier. Steven Adams caught Mason Plumlee, is he the next VP of the NBPA?"
"I really like Ben Simmons as a point-forward-center on the Hornets where he splits point guard duties with LaMelo, big man duties with PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, and Mason Plumlee and transforms our defense. I just don't think we have the assets to pull off a trade unless Philly is enamored with Hayward, and also we cratered our guard rotation and shooting from the bench unit in the offseason so the fit isn't as good as it would've been a few months ago.   Idk if he'd necessarily be the #1 option Rozier, Ball, or Hayward would likely take more shots, but any combo of 3 of them could easily be in the 17-20 ppg range."
Peak Mason Plumlee off the bench lmao.
mason plumlee at center
"Mason Plumlee is your best Center, and he didn't play today. And he isn't good anyway."
Mason plumlee disagrees
Maybe the Hornets should trade for him. Is he better than Mason Plumlee?
"We really don't dislike anyone except Mason Plumlee, but I'm sure people could realize that.  On the opposite hand, we despised Cody Martin last year but he has grown so much and is an invaluble defensive anchor for our team. Went from the fanbase cringing when he went to scorer's table to us now feeling nervous when he's not on the floor in close games."
Only 7 points though 🥱 they need to trade him for offensive maestro Mason Plumlee immediately
"I've heard multiple opposing announcers refer to mason plumlee as a ""respectable center"". They don't know. NOBODY KNOWS."
"Mason Plumlee. For some reason, the man can only put his hands up whenever protecting the rim. He’s a great passer, don’t get me wrong, but he is a non-existent defensive presence on a team that desperately needs rim protection.  The reverse answer to this question is Kelly. He’s a great player and I haven’t heard many bad things being said about him on our sub, but Warriors fans are jumping into every thread about Kelly here and pretending like he’s the worst player in the world + we hate him as well (not often or even close to it, but I’ve seen it)."
I nominate Mason Plumlee
"I detest Coach K, but you can’t really blame him for the development of one and dones. It’s just not nearly enough time - they arrive shortly before season starts and they’re gone as soon as it’s over. They don’t even have full offseasons in the program.   And that’s why there’s so many Duke busts. They’re all highly touted high school recruits who don’t stay.   But if you look to the guys who stay at Duke and develop, they’re doing fine. Allen, Seth Curry, Mason Plumlee, etc. Not superstars but well developed useful NBA players."
&gt; and in turn get a big extension if he wasn’t on the lakers  He absolutely gets around 10 million a year from someone.  Do people think he's on a max contract?  He's getting paid the same as Mason Plumlee and Alec Burks.
"It's definitely more chill but idk man, Mason Plumlee isn't very...popular"
The Mason Plumlee of Mo Bamba's!
Mason Plumlee is a starting center in the NBA
"I agree that there is a lot of coded language and problematic terms involved with different players in sports…  But in this instance, it could have been mason plumlee and if he was sprinting around trying to fight LeBron while taking dozens of people to hold him back… kept breaking free of people, pushing people aside and sprinting towards the other team for minutes at a time… then into the tunnels to go try to fight lakers..?  It would have still been called “animal or barbaric behavior”… It’s been a long time since someone absolutely lost it on the basketball court like that. It’s not racist to say he lost it and was dangerous"
"Gordon Hayward, Mason Plumlee and Ish Smith make up 30 of our 54 years of experience by themselves, lol"
Mason plumlee
Mason plumlee
mason plumlee still exist unfortunately
Mason Plumlee is pretty bad too on both ends
Mason Plumlee with one fucking rebound…
Can I interest you in the a lightly used PJ Washington? And just for you I’ll throw in Mason Plumlee 😊
"From the article:  “It’s all well and good that we have some other things to entertain us, like Steph Curry doing Steph things with a real team around him in Golden State and the DeMar DeRozan-led Bulls trucking teams in the East.  Just don’t lose sight of the big picture, folks: Jokic is still the most effective regular-season player in basketball. Voters seemingly reluctantly gave him the MVP last year and again appear to be scanning the universe for alternatives, and it may be harder to convince them after seeing Curry go amazeballs on Tuesday in the league’s most prominent TV game of the season.  People: I get the Stephmania and all because the Warriors have been unbelievable (and we’ll get to that soon here), but for the love of all that is holy, would you please stop dismissing Jokic? He’s basically a 7-foot point guard at this point, dragging an injury-riddled Denver team to competence.  Yet we’ve heard comparatively little Jokic banter thus far, despite the fact that through 13 games, his PER of 35.4 ranks … (checks notes) … first all-time.  All. Time.  By a wide margin, actually — the all-time best heading into this year was 31.86 by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019-20. It’s only 13 games, and maybe Jokic’s numbers will dip as the year goes on, but nothing about his start has seemed particularly fluky or weird.  Even relative to the other four players who have been notably awesome in the early part of the season, Jokic has been on a completely different level.  We’re blessed with some awesome players right now, but in terms of production, it’s The Joker’s world. Yet, reading the tea leaves, it already seems very possible Jokic won’t repeat as MVP due to some combination of voter boredom and embarrassing oversight.  (Also, while we’re here: It is an unconscionable, embarrassing mistake that Jokic was left off the league’s top 75 players of all-time list, just to leave room for misty-eyed wistfulness about the fourth-best players on Lakers, Celtics and Knicks teams of yore. “Sure, this Jokic fella is good, but he’s no Dave DeBusschere.”)  The breadth of what The Joker is doing is overwhelming. Skill-wise, he’s the best passer in the league, but he’s also second in rebounding; oh, and he’s shooting 38.3 percent on 3s. And — get this — he’s sixth in scoring, while very nearly leading the league in 2-point shooting percentage at 66.3 percent.  Defensively, he’s less off-the-charts awesome, but his IQ and giant mitts still make him effective. (Fun fact: Jokic has more steals than Giannis, Trae Young or Kevin Durant. He’s in the league’s top 50 in both steal and block rate.) The Nuggets, quietly, are third in the NBA in defensive efficiency despite missing multiple key players, which sort of neutralizes the “WuT AbOUt hIs D?” angle.  In addition to having the best individual stats in the league, Jokic’s impact stats are borderline hilarious. The Nuggets are plus-14.2 points per 100 possessions when he plays, minus-11.6 when he sits, nearly a 26-point swing depending on whether he’s in the game.  The eye test backs up the numbers. He’s steadily improved his doughy physique and now moves better than ever, gliding past opponents in transition and making guard-like moves closer to the rim. As a roller, it’s been interesting to see him use long strides and (gasp!) athleticism to get chances close to the rim rather than ambling into jump hooks like he used to.  And mixed in, of course, are assorted displays of a rare basketball genius. He’s reinventing the game on the fly, doing stuff no big man has ever done and adding to the repertoire as he goes. Oh, here, let me just whip this one-handed, no-look, pick-and-roll dish to a driving Aaron Gordon.  Even as the Nuggets scuffle along in fits and starts through early injuries and bad bench units, Jokic has been unbelievable. Night to night, he’s not just the most effective player in the league, but he also makes at least one mind-blowing play every single game … and everyone just kind of ignores it and goes about the day. Playing in the Rocky Horror Time Zone doesn’t help, but it’s still weird. It doesn’t help that the league still markets him like he’s Mason Plumlee.  Fans of good basketball: Appreciate this guy. He is an awesome, generational talent at the absolute peak of his powers.”"

It’s even worse when you’re a Hornets AND UNC fan…mason Plumlee is definitely one of my least favorite dookies of all time but I got to deal with him now smh
You get Mason Plumlee and a dozen Boberry biscuits. Take it or leave it.
"Yeah that’s what I figured, they’re so in the zone they might not notice. But sometimes the person is right there beside them with their hands out and the player looks at them and just throws the shirt on the ground  (I saw Mason Plumlee do that in todays game) that’s what triggered the post lol"
We definitely deserved to lose but I do wanna say one thing. Watching mason plumlee play basketball makes me wanna gouge my eyes out.
"lol, exactly. Mason Plumlee used to shoot 3s during warmup with the Nuggets."
Mason Plumlee has the same amount of dunks this season as the WNBA has in it's entire history.
I can't get over the fact that Mason plumlee is a starting center in the league
I can't believe mitch made Mason Plumlee a starting center in the NBA. He's decent (being generous) as a back up but should be no where near a starting C in the league.
Imagine mason plumlee trying to defend that team 💀💀
Mason Plumlee exists too
Oops I'm racist. I meant Mason Plumlee
Mason Plumlee is your center IDK how a team will go far enough with him
"I completely agree. I got so sick of watching him waste almost the entire shot clock for multiple critical possessions. It was even worse when he had Mason Plumlee on him at the 3pt line and he doesn’t even try to drive past him, which he should easily be able to do."
He was legit horrible today. Got clamped by mason plumlee
"&gt; decent on the statsheet  -17, 7 TOs 5/15 FG. He's not decent on the statsheet. The Hornets put Mason Fucking Plumlee on this guy and he had a hard time."
can't do much on defense with mason plumlee anchoring the middle
[serious] Is mason plumlee the greatest player of all time?
Mason Plumlee
If mason plumlee is your starting center you’re going to have a bad time
"Mason Plumlee has been hot garbage this year. If we had anybody else at center, he'd certainly be out of the rotation already, but nope, Mitch Kupchak looked at the roster and thought Plumlee, Kai Jones, Nick Richards, and Vernon Carey was good enough."
"Mason Plumlee is 9-31 (29%) at the free throw line this season, and the rest of his game is following suit.  Prior to last night, Charlotte was #1 in PPG and #30 in opposing PPG. (We're now #2 in PPG, still #30 on defense)"
Mason plumlee should not be playing in the nba  Also lamelo is inefficient
"Oh okay. Didn’t know that about Horford and thought Schroeder was starting. Didn’t watch the game you guys blew us out of the water lol.  Schroeder is a great backup. Recently, I saw a post about the Hornets and how Mason Plumlee was really trash for them at center. I like the Nuggets and would love a competent backup to Jokic and Plumlee was that for some time. Then I watched a Hornets game and saw Plumlee getting banged around like a pinball and realized that the difference between starting and playing backup can sometimes be pretty different. While Plumlee was good as an energy guy and muscle some backups, he gets eclipsed by the Embiids, Jokices, Goberts and Bams of the world. As a backup he’s fine, as a starter not so much.   I think of Schroeder similarly. Great backup and meh starter."
"It's rare I go to bat for JB, but he's pretty far down the list of things wrong with the team at the moment. No coach is getting this team to the top 6 in the east as long as Mason Plumlee, Nick Richards, Kai Jones, Vernon Carey is our center rotation. We could cut all of them but Kai, replace them with free agents  like Noah Vonleh, John Henson, Harry Giles... And be noticeably better off than we are now, that's the state of our frontcourt. I thought Plumlee would basically be Zeller with less ball skills and more physicality but he hasn't even been replacement level, he's disgustingly bad."
"Hayward is fine when he's healthy but factoring in the Batum stretch he is just not worth 39m a year at all. Especially when he wasn't a position we needed filling at all - we have been so terrible at C these past 2 years and it's absolutely insane that our only answer has been Mason fucking Plumlee. Saving money for Holmes this summer or mustering up assets for someone like Turner would've been a much wiser plan than blowing all your money on a ""star"" who isn't even that good. Look at Atlanta, the first thing they did when they realized Trae was the real deal was to pair him up with a dominant rim runner in Capela"
U feel my pain bro. Everytime mason plumlee pretends hes jokic or oubre thinks hes lebron. I have to remember that borrego is the guy who keeps giving these guys mins.
TBF when your you have mason plumlee as a starting center it's hard to get a lot of rim protection
the best center in the league is whoever Mason Plumlee or Nick Richards is going up against at the time
most of our problems are solved by launching Mason Plumlee into the sun and convincing Indiana to trade us Myles Turner for nothing
Idk on one side the hornets desperately need defense on the other end we already have enough bad contracts. Terry rozier and mason plumlee for al horford and marcus smart.  edit: Nvm forgot we cant trade terry yet
"Mason Plumlee is a shadow of himself, and he was never very good to begin with"
"We actually had to sit a lot of guys near the end of last season in order to be really bad. Unless Mason Plumlee and Wayne Ellington were the secret sauce, we basically have the same roster with Olynyk replacing Plumdog's role and Cade swapping in for Ellington."

"Mason ""worse than Biyombo"" Plumlee"
Mason Plumlee is horrific lmao
Mason Plumlee has been gunning pretty hard for that title but DJ probably still has him beat.
Mason Plumlee is ass
"Just from watching this game against ya'll its clear you guys need a draymond green esque player because this team is dying to run a true small ball 5. You guys have the youth, speed, and the explosiveness for it. Mason Plumlee just doesn't fit this team at all.  You can tell this is still a young team that just need a defensive captain  and the sky is the limit honestly"
"This roster has some of the most confusing roster construction of perhaps any team in the league and it's really starting to cost us games. We decided to completely forgo the offseason by trading for Mason Plumlee and the results have been disastrous. Of course we are trying to pivot to almost full-time small ball but our highest paid players in Hayward and Rozier are both basically the opposite of the type of player you want next to Lamelo - ball stoppers, can't drive past anybody, not particularly good passers. Basically the only thing holding this team together is Miles being consistently nuclear to start the season.  I would go into the bench but let me just say Oubre and Ish Smith are not the type of players who should be the primary options against the staggered stars that basically every other team puts out against our 5 bench lineup. We should've just kept Monk because Kelly is just fucking terrible except the occasional game where he drops 5 threes"
"Have fun with the formatting:  LAMELO BALL HAS has already seen the future.  Two seconds earlier, he watched [Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers) center [Jarrett Allen](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen) vault over [Mason Plumlee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee) to tomahawk a ferocious slam to give the Cavaliers a nine-point lead three minutes into the second quarter. He saw the Cleveland reserves on the bench rise in exaltation, scream hysterically, flicking their white towels. He heard the Quicken Loans Arena crowd roar its approval.  ADVERTISEMENT  Still, optimism flows from the eyes of Ball. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees it: [Miles Bridges](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066383/miles-bridges) sprinting down the middle of the floor.  Before the Cavs' reserves can even sit down, Ball [hurls the ball 80 feet down the court](https://youtu.be/a1Fjk_s52Sc?t=171) over all five Cavaliers and directly into the hands of Bridges. It's a Sunday afternoon pass on a Friday night, one that's thrown in what seems like a different time and space.  Less than four seconds after Allen picks himself up off the floor following his throwdown, Bridges drops the ball through the opposite hoop with a reverse dunk.  ""He really is a basketball savant,"" says [Charlotte Hornets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets)' teammate and 12-year veteran point guard [Ish Smith](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4305/ish-smith). ""You watch him make these calculated-risk passes, and I'm like, 'How did he even think about throwing it like that?'""  Sheer chutzpah.  A 20-year-old with nothing more than an abbreviated NBA season on his résumé has the audacity to stunt the opponent's momentum with a pass that couldn't possibly have a success rate leaguewide of greater than 10%. Tracking platforms with probability scores -- eat your heart out. For the second consecutive game to start the season, the Hornets are behind early to a middling opponent. And for the second consecutive game, Ball is poised to drag the Hornets by the scruff of their necks back into the contest.

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward [Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and [P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington) could make jumps and add to production provided by [Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from [Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics) a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ￼Through the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3. Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like [Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks), [Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons) and [Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic) all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Some NBA point guards might extend a middle schooler their mercy, especially if the kid is the boss' son. But Ball doesn't temper his competitiveness. As he sizes up his teenage combatant, Ball delivers the trash with a smile.  A crossover to the hole elicits a shimmy from Ball, one returned when his teenage competitor drains a shot. Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity. Something that those who delight in amusement when they hear about the pro baller not pulling punches in the sweetest exhibitions against the most adoring minors can never understand: There's no such thing as turning it off.  Once the afternoon Carolina heat thickened to a stew, LaMelo, his brother LiAngelo -- Gelo to everyone present that afternoon -- and a friend jumped into the Borregos' pool, where they continued hooping with the Borrego kids under rules modified for water.  On the surface, there's nothing odd about the scene -- a confident LaMelo and his brother playing backyard camp counselor. But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
ben simmons for gordon hayward and mason plumlee sounds fair
I respect the hell out of the bulls gm for making the moves he did to get a competent roster around lavine cause mitch kupchak watched bismack biyombo fumble the ball every possession last year and he thought mason plumlee was the key. The man does a fine job drafting but he can’t build a team for shit.
"Or we wind up having our wings dig so much on drives that we give up wide open threes (thank god we're not doing that so far this year, but might have to against someone like Embiid)  Point being, it's completely unacceptable to neglect the C position like Kupchak has. Kai Jones might be the answer in like 4 years, but if we're trying to do anything with the Hayward/Rozier timeline, don't do some half measure BS, go out and get a legit starter... plugging that hole with Mason Plumlee barely even qualifies as a half measure.  And the backup situation is rough, at least make it look like you care, by trying out some competent C's that don't have a team at the moment. Dieng, Vonleh... The idea of having Plumlee as a starter and Nick Richards as a backup in a playoff series against Embiid or even Adebayo/Capela is laughable."
What do you mean what happened? Mason Plumlee is on the team.
We definitely got some calls but it shouldnt be surprising that a team starting 3 7 footers gets fouled a lot when playing a team whose only real big is Mason Plumlee.
Turns out that having Mason Plumlee as your only supposed rim protector makes you prone to fouling
Mason Plumlee is like 4'7 going up against these dudes
Anyone else think Mason Plumlee looks a lot like Mike from Mystery Science Theatre 3000?
"mason plumlee is 31, bagley is 22.  bagley hasn't even had a chance to develop yet"
"Bro, we are starting mason plumlee. Hell yes we will take him for free"
"Mason Plumlee heard that you called him small, and is on the way to your house to have a word."
Mason plumlee would like to have a few words
I watched mason Plumlee hit 10 corner threes in a row in warmups once   Also watched Hassan Whiteside splash down threes in warmups too but that one was less unexpected because he was a decent shooter in game when he was in Portland
"Bol has a longer way to becoming a rotation level defender than Markus Howard. I personally love having him as a hype man in blowouts and just as a quiet, mysterious, slender-man chilling on the bench, but there have been more than enough occasions to make me think he does not vibe with the team or Malone much at all. While I would be happy shipping him out for anyone big and remotely competent as a rim defender, even Jordan, we did have Javale log a billion DNPs in the playoffs last year.  No one will ever be Mason Plumlee :("
"He has no jump shot whatsoever so his job offensively is basically set screens, roll, and pass to the corner off the short roll. Kinda like Mason Plumlee"

We literally had years where Mo Harkless or Aminu might've been our second best player.  Not to mention Mason Plumlee started at center.
"That's Mason ""25 million dolla man"" Plumlee to you, sir."
"Mason Plumlee had 500 rebounds with 400 of them being offensive rebounds, and you can't convince me otherwise."
Not if Mason Plumlee has anything to say about it
Mason Plumlee
Pop cutting Trae Young and Bam for Mason plumlee and derrick white was certainly a decision
"you'd think so, but Pop cut him for Mason Plumlee last year so idk"
Mason Plumlee
"Pacers are my least favorite NBA team period. At least constantly shitty teams like the Kings have Fox and Halliburton (Wolves with Edwards/KAT, even the Pistons can be mildly entertaining with triple double god Mason Plumlee). The Pacers are essentially the most mid team every damn year and they’re wasting the careers of every player on the roster. Especially everyone’s favorite white boy TJ McConnell."
"He gave up multiple picks and George Hill to acquire Adams on an insane $30 million contract, and then he extended him another $35 million over two extra years. Meanwhile if Griff just wanted a traditional big next to Zion he could have made Nerlens Noel, Dwight Howard, Bismark Biyombo or Mason Plumlee an offer and grabbed any one of them for a fraction of the price. Or hell, he probably could have *acquired* a pick to take someone like Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond on, considering both were eventually bought out. Who in the hell looks at Steven Adams making $65 million over 3 seasons and thinks ""he's worth giving up quality rotation players and picks for""? That should have been a fireable offense, especially when coupled with the SVG disaster."
"You will get downvoted, but that's true. A lot of defensive ""specialists"" disappear in the playoffs, because defense is almost 100% based on effort, and when all the guys engage in defense, those specialists are irrelevant. I remember having Mason Plumlee on our team. In the regular season, he was earning minutes based on effort on the defensive end, but come playoff time, he was literally unplayable"
A Mason Plumlee if you will
