I think you meant to say we invested that money into bitcoin and made huge profits which were in return used to pay Garrett temple
I'm gonna pretend we pocketed the cash and paid for 70% of Garrett Temple this year and claim we won the trade
"Rooting for Malcolm to reach it again. He’s gonna end up being one of the most underrated players of all time.  Already hit 50-40-90 once. Most likely All Star this year. Quite honestly think he’ll lead (co lead w/ Sabonis) the pacers to a conference finals appearance at least. Dude won ROTY, won defensive player of the year in college. He’s done practically everything. And off the court man is a genius. Malcolm is a pure good guy. Has that organization for building wells in parts of Africa. I love that organization man, so many Africans have to walk so far just to get access to water which Americans take for granted. Build wells for them just beautiful. Joe Harris Justin Anderson Kyle Guy Garrett Temple. Tolliver. They are all involved with it, just a beautiful organization"
"Zach's on-ball defense is actually decent (in spurts) this season. However, Coby White is the 4th worst defender among guards in the NBA - only worse are Lillard, DLo, and LouWill based on Defensive RAPTOR.   Meanwhile, Garrett Temple is the best-rated defender on our team. He should be starting over Coby in order to complement Zach's game. Coby can still play more minutes, but it's not a good idea to play Coby and Zach together"
Garrett Temple
"Coby White, Garrett Temple, Patrick Williams or Otto Porter Jr, Thaddeus Young, Wendell Carter Jr. Not the worst pretty good."
Garrett Temple
"Yeah we just don’t really have any solid defenders right now. TLC and Perry are prone to fouling, DJ has cement in his feet and refuses to move, Harden ball watches.   They have shown flashes of playing good defense. There was a period last game where they held OKC for 8 minutes without a FG, but then got sloppy on defense and they went on a little run.   They definitely need to be more consistent. I think adding some defensive minded players will be key when the buyout comes around. Guys like PJ Tucker, Ariza, Garrett Temple and a decent Center."
Trade for Garrett Temple to construct the   Sexland Love Temple
"Team isn’t complete yet. There’s definitely some guys that will want to be bought out so they can ring chase with the Nets. I can see us going for guys like Garrett Temple, PJ Tucker, Ariza, McGee or Drummond to fill out the roster."
"Honestly Chicago Bulls. This team lacks of primary playmaker and also Ben should play point forward he can defend all 5 positions can switch to everybody. Chicago Bulls starting 5 is full of shooting specialists.   He can play 4 with Markkanen at the 5 and can cover Markkanen's lack of post defending and also he can play point guard for them and they can let White to be microwave scorer.  Garrett Temple, Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams/Otto Porter Jr, Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen five is balanced can be effective on both sides."
"Celtics fans are collectively losing their shit over the prospect of trading for Harrison Barnes.    I personally am pretty intrigued by Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, Garrett Temple, and Otto Porter Jr."
Garrett Temple is my homer pick
"he's just been a rock solid role player for a hundred years. a lot of guys go through little star moments and get more publicity for it, but some guys just be a solid role player for their entire career without a 50 point game or some huge thing. Garrett Temple always stood out in the grizzlies Spurs games I'd always see."
Yeah the superstitious blacks will get it as soon as they see Garrett Temple get a shot.  Stop infantilizing black people. Black people have no issues with taking vaccines.  You look at an anti vax website and tell me what.color the people are.
Garrett Temple  Rodney Hood  Kyle Anderson  Semi Ojeleye  Harrison Barnes
Garrett temple szn
Well you said it. Its the coach lol.  Billy donovan and Ryan Saunders aren't on the same wavelength.  And Garrett Temple is flat out a good player.  The OP making it seem like adding some scrub vets will do anything .  Ed Davis sure helping us a lot isn't he
"Prolly but there’s no guarantee we win it all even if he did spend. It’s not like we were spending it on stars, people are upset because he didn’t extend Ariza for 15M or trade for Garrett Temple/JaMychal Green. I’m sure Harden is tired of carrying teams with role players around him.   On the Nets, he has a higher chance at a finals appearance   Even if Tillman did spend, Harden would still prolly leave   His decision came after we lost to the Lakers, KD and him were hooping together in LA and the rest is history.  There was no possible way for Rockets to get to that level anymore, and he knew it. That’s why he said “we aren’t good enough and it can’t be fixed”"
Garrett Temple
I miss Garrett Temple in DC
"&gt; Bulls bench killing it - Garrett Temple is a god.  I like Temple from the moment he got signed. But you need to consider Mavs being short handed. Mavs starters were out. So their bench was pushed to start. That means Bulls bench, got paired against Mavs third stringers in a specific time in the game. Bulls bench though have been finishing games for Bulls. Especially the ones they won."
"The Bulls are a couple of pieces and a couple of years from being scary, but they have some decent players. But on a night when your one borderline all-star scores 10, your starting PG scores zero, and you're missing a couple of rotation players, Luka and Porzingis really should be enough to get it done.  Even accepting that Dallas was missing a lot of depth players, you're trying me that tonight two all-stars were defeated by the play of Markkanen, Carter Jr, OPJ and Thad Young (4 players that half the Bulls fanbase constantly wants to trade) and 34 year old journeyman Garrett Temple"
Bro I miss Garrett temple
"He was red hot in the first half, torching Patrick Williams and Garrett Temple. I feel like Lavine did a good job on him defensively in the second."
"* Markkanen playing well * Bulls defense is better than usual, they are getting more turnovers and more easy fast breaks than usual * Bulls are limiting their turnovers (so far lol) - this usually kills them * Mavs are down 6 guys (3 starters I think) * Bulls bench killing it - Garrett Temple is a god.  Underrated - Lavine was defending Doncic well. He took over midway through the 3rd and slowed him down after 30 in the 1st half. Doncic was torching the bulls rookie Patrick Williams."
Garrett Temple is the greatest Bull of all time
"The matchup we have been waiting for, Luka vs Garrett Temple"
Apparently Garrett Temple
Garrett Temple is the player I least expected to have such a positive impact
"Who He Play For? is just general ignorance of the league, not aimed at any particular race or ethnic group.   Also, the best way to keep track of player movement is to play fantasy. Even if a Garrett Temple isn't good enough to be directly relevant in fantasy, he's indirectly relevant by being just good enough to steal minutes from guys who are. Examples: Jarrett Culver taking minutes from Anthony Edwards, Troy Brown taking minutes from Deni."
"I don't care what anyone says, Who He Play For? is amazing. No one is keeping track of Garrett Temple."
Considering he mentioned caris levert and Garrett temple as the guys to build around I doubt those comments meant anything.
"Theres a bunch of VPs. Igoudala is the 1st VP then the other VPs are Biyombo, Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Kylie, CJ McCollum and Garrett Temple."
They want Garrett Temple? We got em
"His teammates still defended him too because of his loyalty and being a bit misunderstood  Specifically remember Garrett Temple being a bro and trying to push away a media pest from Demarcus because he knew the media dude was just trying to agitate to get a soundbite.  This was during the last, worst bit of Demarcus's SAC tenure"
This deal does NOT shake up the eastern conference at all! I don’t see how they plan on competing with the Chicago Bulls with THAT roster? Do they not realize the Bulls have Garrett Bartholomew Temple and Cristiano Felicio??
This deal does NOT shake up the eastern conference at all! I don’t see how they plan on competing with the Chicago Bulls with THAT roster? Do they not realize the Bulls have Garrett Bartholomew Temple and Cristiano Felicio??
"Yeah less is more with AG offensively Zach Lowe has said it for years needs to be more like Draymond but he keeps wanting to play like Paul George.   I brought up Gordon because it's really hard to find good defensive wings who can play 30 min a night after the first round of the playoffs. The teams who have them arent looking to deal them.   Garrett Temple is another option but this team really needs a big wing, Durant types are the real issue. Maybe ""small forward"" Larry Nance is available. I havent kept up with Miles Bridges but that might be another one also"
"I bet they feel hell of a lot better then when he called out Nets to surround him, DeAndre Jordan and Garrett fucking Temple with better teammates last year."
Garrett Temple  And as a Dubs fan I was surprised when we signed Kent Bazemore. I thought he retired for some reason
Garrett Temple
That shot by Garrett Temple was insane lol
Garrett Temple says fuck the refs
"It’s not singularly exclusive (like VPs in a company). Iggy is 1st VP, [others include Biyombo, Kyrie, Brogdon, McCollum and Garrett Temple ](https://nbpa.com/leadership)"
They returned 7 of their top 8 in minutes played with Garrett Temple being the exception.
Then Garrett got stuck in our Temple
Well they have Garrett Temple but Chuck wouldn’t know that.
Give Garrett Temple his credit too.
This was Garrett Temple for a few years.
"No. The picks used helped to swallow the remaining salary of the Brendan Knight and Marquese Chriss contracts, as well as ship out Nick Stauskas in the deal that brought Shumpert's expiring contract to the team.  The Rockets could have used the same picks package (technically less) to get JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple from the Grizzlies, but were averse to the $3M in tax that deal would have incurred."
"Not much to go off of yet, only personnel moves hes made are drafting Pat Williams (looking good) and signing Garrett Temple (also been huge for us). You throw picking Billy Donovan as the coach in there and it's been a good start. I'm interested to see what he does with the recent lottery picks - Coby, Wendell, and Lauri - because I'm really skeptical any of them are going to be core, foundational pieces for a contender, and Lauri's rookie deal expires this year."
"I think that’s almost kinda MY point tho in a way and I almost added it to the original post— when we’re talking about significant moves that turned a team from unwatchable to potential playoff and extremely competitive, the fact that ‘well we got Garrett Temple!’ Is something people throw out really shows how little roster turnover there was in this turnaround between Boylen and Donovan."
"Garrett Temple with the casual +39  Also welcome to the Zach &amp; Coby show, bitches"
"It helps to have a guy like Tobias who can score down there. For the early part of the 4th, we used Joel as a floor spacer for Tobias to body Garrett Temple and I thought that was really interesting."
"I’ve a fan since the 90s. I remember watching MJ win.   What your stat is missing is that take out Lavine and what is this team? It doesn’t make it better. If Thad Young had better team plus/minus numbers does that make him a better player? No. What I dislike about your argument is that you’re just throwing a number at me without context and telling me you’re right. These are actual games that happen not a computer simulation of the results. Does Lavine still make boneheaded decisions with the ball? Yes. Is he the go to when the Bulls offense stall? Yes. He’s made so many important 3s to keep the game close or momentum going (you can tell me momentum doesn’t exist, I’m just not gonna agree). Also consider who he has to play with. Coby has been a massive disappointment despite seemingly not bad counting stats. His defense is atrocious and he’s clearly not a PG right now. Lavine has been tasks with a lot of ball handling especially when Sato is not around. Is his defense still mediocre? Yes. But he’s ratcheted up his effort even though he still makes some head scratching mistakes. When the season started the Bulls were getting blown out a lot because frankly the defense was the worst I’ve ever seen from a Bulls team, but WCJ has gotten better and proven with his absence that he’s the most important cog in our defensive unit. The starters do get blown out when they lose so I bet that’s what contributes a lot to that stat. Next your going to tell me Garrett Temple is the best player on the team because my guess is his advanced stats are pretty solid"
"1. Eye test. Just watching.  2. 538's RAPTOR generally paints a solid picture, but you have to contextualize by watching the games. If a player spends heavy minutes guarding every other team's best player, they'll look worse than a guy who's a solid bench piece but guards scrubs. RAPTOR currently has Garrett Temple as a better defender than Draymond Green, but that's obviously not true to anyone who watches the game.  3. Look at opposing player field goal percentages. SAP (stats.nba.com) shows total defended field goal percentage and defended field goal percentage by zone. This tells you how many field goals per game a player is facing, where they're facing them from, and how often an opponent scores when guarded by that player."
Every time I catch a Bulls game Garrett Temple impresses me
"You'll get garrett Temple, Archidiacano, and a second and youll like it!"
"Yeah, it seems to be used differently. You hear people say ""so and so artist"" is a (not the) GOAT or goated which doesn't make much sense if you take it literally but they are just saying they have a really good discography or are somehow notable in the ""story"" of hip hop. So I could say DMX is GOATed for being the first rap artist to release two platinum albums in one year and most people would agree.    I think part of the issue is that sports is much more objective. We can argue about two artists but at the end of the day it will mostly come down to personal preference. Some people will try to use album sales but that doesn't really work either. For basketball if I want to argue something dumb like Garrett Temple (sorry GT) is better than Lebron I'd have to explain why Lebron has been so much more productive."
"Our biggest needs for the buyout market are defense, size, and high IQ players. We’re playing TLC and Shamet a lot of minutes and I don’t think either of them should be getting playoff minutes. I also don’t think Deandre Jordan should be getting play time in the postseason. So if we could replace them with guys like Garrett Temple, PJ Tucker and Javale.. that would be a big upgrade (I’m sure there’s probably better moves that could be made)."
"There is a big difference, but they can play a similar role of locker room vet. Right now, the oldest player on the Bulls is Garrett Temple whose claim to fame is that Charles Barkley doesn’t know which team he’s on.   Kemba would be better suited to a rebuilding team rather than a team with the pressure to win now"

"Not even elite, like just a Courtney Lee/Garrett Temple level player wouldve been enough"
Yep.  2019 Rockets and Warriors series was extremely close. JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple would’ve helped so much.  And dang I remember Melton was on the Rockets but they bundled him with Anderson
Guys who have a better dFG at the rim than jokic contesting at least 90 shots this year   SGA  Fred Van Vleet  Luka Doncic   Garrett Temple  Justin Holiday   Yes that’s the same fred Van Vleet who isn’t tall enough to be allowed on like half the rides at six flags
"Nobody posted this yet, but I watched this game live (Go Bulls! You scrubs.) but just before this Garrett Temple gave him a really hard foul after Temple got blasted in the face and didn’t get a foul and got T’d up. He awoke the dragón!"
Jimmy butler/Joakim Noah.   Man those guys were tough as nails. Our team rn is soft af. No motor at all and are sluggish from the start. Having a guy like those would really help us. We are banking on Garrett temple and Thad young for vet help which is in no ways bad but not ideal.
"He played with Towns years ago and he has gotten way better since then. Im talking about the Lavine we've seen for the past 2ish years.  *It’s not like Lavine has no good players on his team*  Who? TBH I like the Bulls' future, but they absolutely do not have any ""good"" players besides Lavine.  Markkhannen has been out for over half their games and he is **barely** a ""good"" player.  Coby White is averaging 16/5 on terrible efficiency and average/below average defense  Wendell Carter Jr with his 12/8 is average at best but he's also missed close to half their games.  After that, their next best players are Thad Young, Patrick Williams, and Garrett Temple.  Again, I like the Bulls' future. I think Coby, Wendell Carter, Patrick Williams, and Markkhanan are all going to be really good players. But they are definitely not there yet. I don't know how you can look at this roster and think that is even a halfway decent roster. Even with all that though, the Bulls are half a game from the 7th seed. I truly think they are several games worse if you replace Lavine with Mitchell because while Mitchell would very slightly improve their defense, he doesn't improve anything else and the Bulls would score way less points because he isn't anywhere near as efficient as Lavine."
I thought he said Garrett Temple was the best teammate he ever had!
All this to beat Garrett Temple smh
"The full list is   DJ Augustin, Bismack Biyombo, Cody Zeller, Kemba Walker, Garrett Temple, Jared Dudley, Anthony Tolliver , Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (unsigned this season)"
"You just can't jump him in with people LeBron, Luka, and Giannis, as he is tier or more lower in his overall scoring package.  Yes you can build a team around him.  I could also build one around like Siakam or CJ McCollum with the right role players.  The Knicks are having a damn good season with Julius Randle as their best player who is probably outside the top 25 himself.  Roster optimization can do a lot.  The question is why would you want to do that and how many other players would you rather have without knowing any of the rest of your roster.   Like I said, I think that number is around 40.  I also think you're handwaving three importance of shooting because it's convenient.  First, there is a major difference between decent but unremarkable shooters like Shake and high-gravity shooters like Seth.  If there weren't then it would be so expensive to get extremely one dimensional players like Bertans.  It's never going to be a reasonable thing to say ""eh you can always get shooting"".  You can always get replacement level shooters like Garrett Temple but that's not really enough especially when you have a centerpiece like Simmons.  Which is why the 76ers arguably downgraded in overall talent to upgrade their shooters.  They want to need to cover his weaknesses in order to make him somewhat close in performance to what they've invested in him."
Garrett Temple
Garrett Temple gave us this jewel.
He gave that franchise everything he had and it’s unfortunate Fertitta couldn’t reciprocate by going into the luxury tax to bring back Ariza or even trade for JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple at the 2019 trade deadline
Wizards fan - hire a new coach ASAP . In the draft identify whoever the best 3&amp;D SG/SF is in our draft position &amp; pick that dude. And add another MLE veteran wing in the offseason (guys like Garrett Temple or Trevor Ariza). Maybe see how the season starts and package Thomas Bryant + some stuff at the trade deadline for another guard or wing who shoots threes
We're not just gonna ignore what Garrett Temple is doing here
"Shoutout Garrett Temple with game high +14 .. so many teams need a quality wing player who is at least competent in all areas of the game, in that aspect he is one of the better glue guys in the league.  I really wanted the Wiz to bring him back last summer"
Who needs LeBron when you have Garrett Temple (of Doom) and Thadgic Johnson on the same team. Just kidding I am in great pain.
Garrett Temple.  I think we could have used his salary in some trades.
"Is Prince actually consistent this year on whatever team is on now? I liked him when he played well and thought he was a solid defender, but he would keep missing 3s in cold streaks and wasn't a good enough decoy shooter for Joe Harris. Garrett temple was pretty much an all around better version of prince last year."
"It's worth considering from the perspective of the league's overall health. Certainly the longterm legacy and value of the league matters more to Kawhi and LeBron than a guy on a two-way contract who's going to be done in 2 seasons.   I just don't think the NBPA (or any union) is setup that way. From a labor perspective, it's much harder to see the benefit of being in a union if you get less say than a guy who is going to be around longer than you and make more in a season than you do in your career. If that were the case, I'd probably be better off negotiating directly with management/ownership—or even teaming up with players in a similar salary bracket as me.  The owners have the same problem—Robert Pera and Dan Gilbert are equals when the Board of Governors meets. Gilbert doubtless has a lot of influence as the owner if the Knicks, but he still only gets one vote. It's on the commissioner to prevent the owners from voting for interests that only benefit them in the short term or that hurt the longterm viability of the league. It helps to have voices like Cuban that are strongly concerned about the longterm, but the commissioner can come at it from a more neutral position.  The NBPA is led by players, but I think that means that it's hard to 100% trust leadership if you aren't one of the top guys. They try to address this by having guys like Garrett Temple be a VP, but ultimately players are going to trust their agent over Chris Paul when it comes to money."
"Maybe. I expected more from LaVine under Billy Donovan after we insulated him with better team defenders like Pat Williams and Garrett Temple. He was better this year, but is not mentally quick enough to be a high level reader on the defensive end. Maybe a few years in one system he will change my mind as hes played for a lot of coaches and defensive styles thus far. But I really dont see that happening with LaVine as hes not as strong or long and cant defend any large wings or 4s like Wiggins can.   Wiggins defensive versatility alone makes him more valuable there to me."
"Every role players ""graduated"" from Spurs are somehow able to perform with great basketball IQ, play ball the right way, are reliable and able to stick in the league for quite a while.  Garrett Temple  Gary Neal  Kyle Anderson  Cory Joseph  Danny Green"
"we got a new one before this season. he brought in the veteran Garrett temple before the season and then traded at the deadline to get Vucevic, Theis, TBJ, and Aminu. He also drafted Patrick Williams in the draft.   Most of us agree with all of the moves he has made and are happy to have a front office that is trying to build a team. our previous front office never really did anything tbh. they drafted talent and not much else. we ended up with a team with a lot of talent that didn't mesh well together.  right now our new front office is still trying to untangle the mess that was left behind. we will have a better idea of how good they are after next season"
"U missed the part where he said ""Garrett Temple can still catch these hands"""
"Yeah why the hell did Garrett Temple latch on to YOU....like, there has to be some benefit for him to spend real time with a muckraker. Grown professionals don't just invite strangers to diaper changings to open up about their co-workers lol."
"I think they know what they signed up for. My deal with the players and with the Nets organization was that I would ask honest and difficult questions, for an honest and uncommon book. No tweets for two years. Very few off-the-record conversations. But no holds barred. GM Sean Marks told me: ""Earn their trust, then you'll get what you're looking for.""  So I'd have a typical corner-of-the-locker-room chat with a player like Garrett Temple, who then invited me to a community event that he was doing in the neighborhood we shared. Later that night, without asking ""permission"" of his agent or the Nets but more because I had a nice conversation with his family visiting from out of town, Garrett invited me over for dinner at his place, and then we'd go to his bedroom to talk, on the record, for an hour, about everything. (And then I'd get a bottle of champagne to bring over to KD's place in the city a couple hours later, but that's a whole other story.)  These were private/intimate conversations, on the record, if that makes sense. Very rarely do you get extended access like that, other than for a magazine profile. But this was kinda like 15 magazine profiles back-to-back-to-back, with the trust for one building up to the next, and the next one after that. I think pro-basketball players are used to media scrutiny, and so they're cool with an accurate portrayal of how all that played out."
"1. I think we all know that LeBron set the modern template for playing pseudo-GM, more than a decade ago. What struck me in my year-and-a-half embedded with the Nets (and interviewing hundreds of people across the NBA) was that the superstars get sign-off on so many big decisions, including when to cut loose a player based on factors like personality fit and even personal politics, not just skill. I spoke to Garrett Temple after The Bubble (while he was changing his son's diaper), and he began: ""Players have a LOT of say nowadays in this league."" Then we got to talking about how Kyrie wanted to boycott The Bubble, and how a lot of players like Garrett thought their voices might be louder in the fight for racial justice by playing on. But he and Kyrie had an airing of differences about this. Garrett went on: ""Players in the leadership, if you go against what they want you to do, then they won't want you back... If that's the case, then I don't wanna be on this team.... But Kyrie is the enigma of the century, so who knows?”   2. My reporting doesn't indicate that KD's Achilles tear changed much of anything in terms of his free-agency decision — other than that Kyrie was really pissed off that the Warriors let his friend and future teammate play in the Finals. Kyrie definitely led the way to Brooklyn, with his roots from growing up a Nets fan in Jersey. But their conversations about teaming up began before that ""two max slots"" Zapruder film in the tunnel at the 2019 All-Star game. And I think all the speculation about the Knicks, while he was still in the Bay, really got to KD."
"Using the infamous Vibe Death Row cover as a template, which Net player is Tupac, Snoop, Dre, and Suge Knight?  Who’s more likely to succeed in their post playing career, Spencer Dinwiddie as a disruptive business man or Garrett Temple as politician?"
"Kyrie tried too. Once LeBron came in kissing ass, Kyrie’s faction lost steam.   Kyrie wasn’t super fired up about it like he is about racial injustice. Garrett Temple was the most frustrated, IIRC. But one thing the book makes clear throughout is how much the league takes its queues on contentious issues from stars - namely LeBron."
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
"the rockets mistake still was not going into the tax.  They needed bodies in 2019 with no replacement for ariza, they could've easily gotten jamychal/garrett temple like the clippers did"
"Garrett temple has made 32 million in his career, I don’t know how bad he needs the paycheck to get by"
Seems like Garrett temple was the big source here.  Guessing him and Kyries relationship probably pretty bad now even tho kyrie initially recruited him.   What’s funny is that temple claims kyrie is biased because he’s rich and can afford to sit out and then claims sitting out won’t do anything. But he’s just as biased since he needs the paychecks to get by.   At the end of the day whether you agreed with kyrie or not it was obviously worth the discussion. And labeling kyrie as the great disruptir was some of the worst trash espn has ever produced which is saying something.
"&gt;	Garrett Temple found Kyrie’s entire insurrection to be rushed and relatively unnecessary. He reminded players on the call that the world was at a standstill. Baseball’s return had been stalling, the Dallas Cowboys were testing positive, and college athletes were bringing coronavirus back to campus. The bubble would offer time to discuss more demands, while players could pour their paychecks back into their communities and set an example for what Black generational wealth looked like. By the time the games began, Garrett said, people would have to watch basketball and listen to their message; the NBA would be the only thing on.  Temple is a smart dude."
Garrett Temple doesn’t seem like he has much time for Kyrie lol
"Idk why people hate on Ben Simmons, it's like hating on Garrett Temple or Biyombo."
"Imma be objective and not talk about the Pistons.  But any decent 3&amp;D guy on any of those KD/Westbrook teams, like even if it's Courtney Lee or Garrett Temple that would've made such a huge difference"
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
That knicks team is a prime example of when you play young guys too much without consequence  The Nets team who’s best player is Garrett Temple in this specific minute of the game ain’t much better
"I joined this Fantasy Football league where you can play against Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Diamond DeShields, and Victoria Vivians. There are still spots but you have to sign up by the 24th. There is a live virtual draft with all the players on the 26th.  https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"The Pelicans tried that and they ended up with Devonte Graham, Tomas Satoransky, and Garrett Temple instead"
So tampering rules require a team to talk to a player under contract with another team. Who did the Pelicans talk to that was under contract?   Pelicans received Tomas Satoransky (under contract) and Garrett Temple from the sign and trade with Bulls. Is the assumption that the Pelicans talked to Temple? Or that the Bulls did to get the sign and trade done?
Garrett Temple
Garrett Temple
Could you post Garrett Temple speaking english next?  Should be equally surprising.
&gt;depsite him having a hate boner for griffin. he might be right. cause they were desperate go get lowry but he dipped to miami like 3 minutes later and lonzo dipped as well  Every GM knew on August 1st that Lowry was going to Miami (days ahead of FA deadline) because they set it up with the Goran Dragic deal.  So Griffin knew he wasn't getting Lowry by that point. He had a lot of guards he targeted but none of them I think he was dead certain he was attaining.  kind of why JJ's accusation doesn't make sense.  Also Pels could get in trouble for the Garrett Temple signing in the deal.
What’s Garrett Temple? Churchgoing  Danny Green ?
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Saw that Pacers' Malcolm Brogdon's charity is hosting a fundraiser where you can play fantasy football against NBA and WNBA players. They'll have a live draft event on August 26th. Right now the players are Diamond DeShields, Victoria Vivians, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Malcolm Brogdon. https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"Then by this logic, the Bulls should be fine because you could argue that the Pelicans tampered with Garrett Temple."
Garrett temple
imagine if the NBA swings the hammer on the Pelicans for getting Garrett Temple and Tomas Satoransky and nothing else because tampering lost them any leverage
"* ""Hello, Lonzo? This is the Bulls. I assume you're sitting there with the Pelicans so let's cut right to it: what do you guys say to a trade of Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple and a second-round pick so that we can sign Lonzo for $85 million over the next four years?""  * ""Sounds great here, agreement all around.""  * ""Perfect, I'll notify Shams that this is happening.""  * ""Thanks, bye."""
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valančiūnas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
"DeRozan really does not matter if you watched any bulls games. Lauri/Coby were pretty bad on defense, Sato isnt amazing. Our best perimeter defenders was 19 year old Patrick Williams and old ass Garrett Temple. We literally have better defenders then last year and we were middle of the pack. Makes absolutely 0 sense that we get worse."
We were around 11-14th in defense this season and got better defenders then last year in Caruso and Lonzo. Our best perimeter defenders was 19 year old Patrick Williams and old ass Garrett Temple. How we going to be worse.
"And lost Theis, and Wendell Carter, and Garrett Temple, they're leaning extremely hard on Patrick Williams, Lonzo, and Caruso to provide defense here because Vuc, Lavine, and DeRozan aren't contributors there. Their defensive statistics last year were spared by bad defenders missing time."

"Meh. Some great moves, some bad ones.   - Garrett Temple for Lonzo: A - #8 and a future first for Vucevic: F - Signing Caruso: A - $85m for DeRozan: D"
Isn't Garrett Temple still pretty young?
"Man you really buy into the “team targeting player” nonsense that’s built up by agents to increase their contract offers.  They had the cap space to sign Dinwiddie for way more than the wizards if they wanted to. You guys are also way overvaluing Lonzo. He’s a 3&amp;D player who thinks he’s Jason Kidd.  All said, currently they added Jonas Valenciunas, Devonte Graham, Tomas Satiransky and Garrett Temple while losing Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams.  May not be remarkable improvement but hard to say they’re not better. Adding JV and shedding Bledsoe is huge."
"Different coaches every year. Basically moving players in and out. Allowing a guy he wanted to stay leave for Satoransky and Garrett Temple. You guys also will probably finish somewhere between 10-12 again this year.   There’s obviously still time, but I would say it’s not gone well since you’ve drafted him."
Garrett Temple is a nice floor spacer...and teammates all rave about him being a great guy...he can be the new Zion whisperer
"yet Pels got fucking Satoransky, Garrett Temple, and a 2nd for the same thing but with Lonzo"
Garrett Temple upvote party
Garrett Temple is the minimum GOAT
Zion hates your franchise so much he looked like he was about to cum his pants in the post game interview  after he played the Knicks last year as he was openly saying MSG is his favorite place to play LMAOOOOOO.  Y’all just went from Lowry to Dinwiddie to Graham to settling on Satoransky and Garrett Temple.  Not to mention that Lonzo got out of dodge as quickly as possible and JJ Redick has a huge platform with his podcast where he has dedicated plenty of time to shitting on your garbage FO.  #LMAOOOOO
Every time I look up Garrett Temple is on a different team.  I could’ve swore he was in New Orleans already
"just a heads up, that garrett temple deal is 5 million per year, not total"
Someone legit invented a time machine and the first thing they do is send Garrett Temple back to the 2000’s?? smh…
Especially since y’all just got rid of Garrett Temple for Lonzo.  Congrats btw
david west tyson chandler and now Garrett temple too?  2009 is going to be our year
"I ain't saying he trash, but I've seen garrett temple hold him below 10 points and 35% shooting twice in a month's time."
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
Garrett Temple
"But they also let Lonzo walk for some reason and got Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple and a second round pick..........  I hate how they didn't trade him earlier if they wanted him to walk."
Garrett Temple
"Same, was sure he could be kinda a new version of Courtney Lee or Garrett Temple"
"And we all know who those dudes are, too -    Garrett Temple, Kawhi, and Doug McDermott"
Yep. Everything involving Steven Adams most reminded me of everything the Pelicans did years ago with Omer Asik. Someone should list out every assert the Pels got from both the AD and Jrue trades and compile what the Pels have got with those assets so far. Cause they turned Lonzo into Garrett Temple and Satoransky and they used two picks getting and then getting rid of Steven Adams. I feel like Griffin got this stockpile of assets from those trades and he's been steadily throwing them away ever since.
"So why not match his offer then. Even if you don't want Lonzo, you should be able to trade him for more than just Garrett Temple and Tomas Satoransky"
"I guess my push back from a ‘buy-in’ perspective is that at the beginning of last year this was a team that had a younger starting 5 than the University of Wisconsin and aspirations to maybe be the 10th best team with zero career all-stars and now they have three all-stars and a relativity of hope. So in terms of inspired ball I get why Thad is such a floor leader but I think this team is far more excited and willing to push compared to yesteryear.  To me the main thing is simply that anyone who watched the Bulls last year knows how bad the on-ball, point of attack, pressuring of the ball handler was. Teams had such an easy job setting up half court sets and not feeling pressured and getting to set their own tone. Thad’s IQ and help defense made up for a lot of mistakes. I think the hope is that if they can actually pressure the ball at the point of attack with more than just a Garrett Temple, it’ll make some of those help roles easier.   Perimeter pressure was soooo bad. Interior might have stayed the same or even taken a small step back. But like when people say some overrate Lonzo’s defense— I mean they probably do. But the starting 1 for the Bulls this time last year was Coby White. And the difference on defense between Lonzo and Coby is just massive."
"And the bulls collectively had one of the worst point of attack teams in the NBA last year and one of the worst perimeter defenses. They already had players who weren’t good on defense. Now they have a few more who are. It’s not making a pro-DeRozan defense argument to say that replacing one turn style with another doesn’t really make a defense worse. So adding around it matters.   DeRozan + PWill is just not worse than PWill+Mark on defense. I’m not saying it’s good. But it’s not going to be significantly worse.   The collective talent of the bulls on defense last year was pitiful. Ball, Caruso, another year of PWill and they have at least some solid players which couldn’t be said last year in that capacity at all.  Garrett Temple and Sato were probably the peak of defense last year. Temple’s the only real loss"
Garrett Temple. Im proud he became a Bull for a season. Such a classy professional.
Garrett Temple is still in the league? Good for him
Garrett Temple currently -10  Stop playing him Willie
Satoransky and Garrett Temple
Coach Willie about to troll me and start Garrett Temple
I think Garrett temple is on the pelicans and I only know that from TNT’s who he play for lol
Garrett Temple
Still surprised that Garrett Temple is 35 years old.
"Garrett Temple, Wayne Ellington"
Why do you think they traded Lonzo for Sato and Bulls Legend Garrett Temple? /s
"I usually do well on these but also 3/5. Knew the Hornets guys and Olynyk but I honestly had no clue where Garrett Temple was this year, I guessed Chicago but he didn’t stay there I guess"
Garrett Temple “Who He Play For?” Hall of Famer  Lmao
I know Garrett Temple more for Who He Play For than even being a player
Garrett Temple is a first-ballot Who He Play For HOFer
Garrett temple cause he has a temple
"Question from NBA.com’s GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix – 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers – 14%  3. T.J. McConnell, Indiana – 10%  4. Mike Conley Utah – 7% Udonis Haslem, Miami – 7% Garrett Temple, New Orleans – 7%  &gt; Also receiving votes: Harrison Barnes, Sacramento; Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana; Draymond Green, Golden State; Joe Ingles, Utah; LeBron James, Lakers; Patty Mills, Brooklyn"
"Griffin didn't want to pay Lonzo 4/85. But yeah, they should have got more than Garrett Temple and Tomas Satoransky back for Lonzo"
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
TIL Garrett Temple is 35. I respect the grind from 4-year college player to G-leaguer to 10-day minimums to make it in the league this long.
Garrett temple is in the 35-38 range?? Holy shit lol
Garrett Temple
"That team had Thad Young, Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, and Daniel Theis. They replaced those guys on D with eMar eRozan and not much else."
Imagine losing a FRP for tampering with Garrett Temple.
"Garrett Temple has to be up there. He's been in leadership positions with the PA, but honestly has some incredibly well thought out interviews over the years, particularly surrounding issues of race. He's great."
He would look really good taking Garrett Temple and Satoransky's minutes
"Well also they old. Dwight doesn't look like he gives a shit anymore, he doesn't have that fire that he had in his first second stint with the Lakers (y'all know damn well what I'm talking about)   The honest truth is Deandre is ok to start for 4 or so minutes, but the Lakers really need someone who's young athletic and agile, like Jordan Bell to come off the bench to do a lot of the dirty work defensively that LeBron, AD and Melo don't want to do.   The Lakers should also try and get Torey Craig or Garrett Temple onto the team, just to try and fill out that wing."
"Jarrett Jack, DJ Augustin, Cody Zeller, Garrett Temple"
"Recently, Garrett Temple"
Garrett temple had to come in against Minny a couple weeks back because Kira Lewis couldn’t bring the ball up against pressure. I wish the fan base wouldn’t look for a scape goat when the whole team sucks ass
Garrett Temple has started 6 games too many
"Tillman was going to go into the tax, just not for Trevor Ariza. Ariza’s contract with the Suns was a huge overpay  If we landed Butler in that trade that almost went through, we would’ve been paying luxury tax.  I do not blame him for not going into the tax for guys like Ariza, Garrett Temple and JaMyChal Green.  The window closed the moment CP3 looked washed in 2019 because Ariza, Green and Temple were not gonna save us  Tillman’s start as an owner was bad but I don’t blame him for this.   Everyone wanted Silas and it looked like a great hire at the time. He was heralded as the genius behind the Mavs historic offense  Also IIRC Stone wanted Silas not Tillman (he wanted JVG while Harden wanted Lue)"
"The thing was, last season Bulls were 11-14th in defensive rating metrics, middle of the road with guys like Lauri and Coby. Billy Donovan is a good defensive coach. People were not realizing that Vooch is not a rim protector but he hold his own defensively in the paint. His real issue is being exposed on switches and being pulled to the perimeter.   Our best defender outside of PWill was Garrett Temple and we upgraded to Caruso and Lonzo. It was obvious we would be better on defense, but I would be lying if I saw us being THIS good.   Basically my point is people boil down defense to on-ball defense and nothing else when in reality its a lot more complex and heavily can be influenced by things like defensive scheme and coaching."
"I don't necessarily disagree with trading him, but the Pelicans did not get a good deal for Lonzo (Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, 2nd round pick). So they should have just matched the offer and try to trade him for something better in future. A small market team can't afford to just trade your prospect for peanuts."
"Not the best, but the Hornets are pretty good:   PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Malik Monk  SF: Nic Batum   PF: Christian Wood  C: Dwight Howard  Bench of Devonte' Graham, Jeremy Lamb, Garrett Temple, Frank Kaminsky, and Cody Zeller. All in their primes, this is a solid squad."
Horford is probably too good to meet your criteria of “decent but not great.” Some that probably do meet it that I haven’t seen mentioned yet though:  Wes Matthews     Garrett Temple      Special mention: Marvin Bagley III - his maternal grandfather played for the Pistons  and then in the ABA in the mid-60’s.
"MDA/Morey weren’t fired. We also got a pick for taking on Wall’s contract, we didn’t give up picks for Wall  To this day, I’d say Tillman’s biggest and only fault was not going into the luxury tax in 2019 for JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple"
"Lowry should agree to sign with the Raptors first. Then Raptors trades him to Miami. How come Raptors and Pelicans would be spared? Because Lowry and Lonzo would first have to agree to sign with their respective teams.   In Bulls-Pelicans trade. Garrett Temple was also signed through a [sign and trade](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-orleans-pelicans/garrett-temple-6492/). And it was reported that he is a part of the Lonzo deal. It’s impossible for Temple to agree to a S&amp;T, without talking to the Pels org."
Garrett Temple shouldn’t be playing serious minutes. He’s a great veteran and leader and can contribute when needed but it’s not a good sign if he’s consistently playing 20-35 mins
Lmao looking at the pels roster they look underwhelming ANDDD lack depth .   like sheesh pick a struggle   Garrett mf Temple was ya second leading scorer
Smh Nets really needed a 40/10 game from Harden and 30 from KD to beat Garrett Temple
This is the Garrett Temple-Joe Harris show.
Garrett Temple revenge game.
"unironically Garrett Temple did good as a veteran presence when he was with us, no slander."
Hey don’t forget the great Garrett Temple

"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
pelicans starting Garrett Temple? jesus christ
"It is a pet peeve of mine that people continue to use the term positionless.  The NBA not positionless. The NBA is position-fluid.  Positionless means positions don't matter because players can fill any role. But Drummond cannot handle the ball and Garrett Temple cannot bang in the paint. Players are more versatile, but they are not 100% adaptable/flexible. That's position fluidity.  Traditional positions make less sense than they used to but they're still relevant.  People need to shift their conceptions of positions, rather than suggest they're basically irrelevant."
"&gt;a guy like Garrett Temple  Certainly fits the mold of that I laid out earlier:  ""journeyman and every team that gets him is ultimately disappointed by his general plainness"""
"I don’t think he’s some huge difference maker but he plays his role and plays it well. He’s not a great shooter you’re right but he’s not someone you can completely abandon either. He’s not an elite defender but he’s an above average one that isn’t going to hurt you on defense. Overall he is high energy and doesn’t actively hurt you on either end.       Just because he may not be much more than he already is doesn’t mean he’s going to drop out of the league. Look at a guy like Garrett Temple, never really been an amazing player but has been in the league for over a decade because he’s good in his role. I think Hart is a lot like that and that’s perfectly okay as long as those are the expectations for him."
Garrett Temple has made 2 3s this quarter. This is an outlier.
"Make a small on the margin trade for a veteran leader that is universally respected. Thad Young, Garrett Temple… someone at that level. That would be their easiest solution before doing something drastic"
I thought that garrett temple and another guy were the same guy. cant remember other dudes name
