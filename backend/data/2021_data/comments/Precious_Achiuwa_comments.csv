"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players — and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  “It’s hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,” said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  “It is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I’m going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,” Ms. Hassam said. “Americans looking to profit off China’s market find themselves in a much more challenging place.”       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade’s Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  “By speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,” Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.’s biggest stars, is known as “China Klay” to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand’s social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to “commit genocide and crimes against humanity” in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.’s reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey’s message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.’s partnership with China was “complicated,” but that “doesn’t mean we don’t speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.”  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D’Angelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  “My decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it’s not just one way of doing things,” Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell’s contract in November 2019. “I had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.”"
He atleast seems to have learned the dirty side of winning plays from CP3. Some of the plays where he managed to get free throws were hilarious. Especially the one where he stopped running to get bumped by Precious Achiuwa.
"Well, tbh a big part of being a good rookie is being able to prove that you're a good NBA player while playing decent minutes in actual NBA games. We could sit around and talk about how Onyeka Okongwu or Precious Achiuwa could've been ROTY candidates if they got enough playing time or something to that effect, but that's still very intangible, unlike actually getting playing time at the highest level and having decent efficiency playing against NBA level players in your first year. They don't put people on All-Rookie teams based on potential, you know."
Precious Achiuwa
"Dude, relax, it's not even that unbelievable of a name... There's literally Precious Achiuwa on the same team. Who has a sibling named Godsgift."
I love precious hachimura man. Rui Achiuwa is my second favourite
It’s Precious Achiuwa
This is the package yeah?  * Tyler Herro * Duncan Robinson * Precious Achiuwa * Kendrick Nunn * Salary Filler * Two 1st-Round Picks * 4 Pick Swaps  That's a huuuuge price to pay but it would have been workable.  Dragic Harden Butler Bam Olynyk.  Maybe you could have kept someone like Nunn out of the conversation too.
"NGL this one hurts, but Jimmy Buckets deserves better than going to the playoffs with Precious Achiuwa as his back up big.     I hope we can snag LMA in the offseason if Kanter wants a big pay day."
If they want to get better right now they would have to part with young talent. Lowry would probably only cost Precious Achiuwa in terms of their prospects but they can’t hold on to all their enticing trade chips while also adding high impact players like Lowry. You’re either in win now mode or you’re still building/re-tooling
Not a good trade for the raptors unless Precious Achiuwa is involved.
"Did you say what they were asking for harden though? Apparently they wanted:  Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson Precious Achiuwa Kendrick Nunn Salary Filler Two 1st-Round Picks 4 Pick Swaps  Bam-harden-butler would be awesome, but there’s no way they win a chip with just that and then literally scraps. so if we don’t win a chip, what’s the point of going all in?"
Can they work together?  u/nyknicks get:  Kelly Olynyk  Precious Achiuwa  2022 - RD 2from Heat  2027 - RD 2from Heat  2027 - RD 1from Heat  u/MiamiHEAT get:  Julius Randle  Bradley Beal  u/WashWizards get:  Andre Iguodala  Meyers Leonard  2022 - RD 1from Heat  2024 - RD 1from Heat  https://tradenba.com/trades/sCFOb0H-3
"The best foreign player this draft so far is Deni Avdija, followed maybe by Precious Achiuwa and Theo Maledon. This draft has just not had made good foreigners."
If either bam or precious can develop a jump shot it can be done. Bams Jumpshot is getting better especially this season. I’ve hear achiuwa has a good shooting form so who knows what good coaching can do for his game
"I cannot understand WHY does defense get overlooked so much when it is HALF the game lol.  How can Brooklyn even compete with Lakers when it's ""Big 3 vs Big 2"" BUT the 2 best defenders are on the Lakers side. So really it's Big 3 vs Big 4, and then the Lakers are much deeper bench wise. So I can't see the Nets winning maybe give them 20 percent chance but it's doubtful that series even goes 7 games.  Now who COULD be the team to upset Lakers???  In the Finals you could see Miami Heat upset the Lakers if Butler is Butler, Bam is Bam, and the supporting cast all shoots 40+ percent from 3 plus they keep up their ELITE DEF in the playoffs like last season. BAM with experience is scary he could match AD possibly, Jimmy can maybe even match an aging LeBron, so it might be cast vs cast and the Heat could have the slight edge if healthy with Precious Achiuwa the difference maker the X factor.  The SPURS??? Yes with Pop coaching and Tim Duncan experience beating the Lakers they can school the young Spurs how to beat the Lakers. Duncan knows how to get inside LeBron head he almost beat him 3 times in the finals. So yes they know LeBron secrets....and then you have the Big 3 of Dejounte, Derozan and LMA who are all very complimentary players. Murray is a DEF beast, Derozan is a leader, and LMA is a Vet. Not to mention the depth of guys like Gay, and Poetl and PATTY MILLS  The Sixers are the BEST team in the NBA this year. They have the MOST depth and the best players. The problem is coaching. Doc Rivers is a choke artist with the Clippers and Celtics. The 2008 win was in spite of him. Awful coach the guy doesn;t have a clue what he's doing out there.  So will the Lakers beat them?? Yes easily only because Doc Stinks. If Phil Jackson was coaching this Sixers team they EASILY win the chip. Embiid &gt; AD, and the Combo of Simmons/Tobias is good enough to match LeBron. Simmons on DEF and transition offense and Tobias with the clutch shooting like his game winner to beat Lakers this year."
" Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, Salary Filler, Two 1st-Round Picks, 4 Pick Swaps For Harden for two years."
No there was a report of Houstons asking price from the Heat  - Tyler Herro - Duncan Robinson - Precious Achiuwa - Kendrick Nunn - Salary Filler - Two 1st-Round Picks - 4 Pick Swaps
"Who knows. Goran Dragic has been hurt recently and Jimmy's coming off COVID but doesn't look that bad. I think the bigger issue is they're putting a ton of pressure on Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to produce on both ends and maybe they're just not ready to be so important to a competitive team's starting 5?  When you're depending on Kendrick Nunn, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to perform well, you gotta kinda accept the inconsistently that comes with it."
"Maybe he can be useful with The Heat? Veteran championship coach with Jimmy Butler and Udonis Haslem as the captains of the team. They won't allow him to behave like that. Plus, The Heat could use some size and rebounding (Olinyk, Injured Meyers Leonard and rookie Precious Achiuwa is Adebayo's help). Adebayo can move to the 4 which could give him a break fighting the Centers and help with perimeter defense a bit more. He also has a good mid range shot now. The Heat need some size right now."
Precious Achiuwa
"It depends on what Toronto is asking for. Even though Lowry's contract is expiring, the Heat are likely looking for his bird rights. So Toronto might leverage those rights for a young prospect: ~~Tyler Herro~~, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson, or Kendrick Nunn.  Also, the Heat likely include some combination of Iguodala ($15m), Olynyk ($12m), and Leonard ($9.7m) to match salaries for Lowry ($30)."
"Kendrick Nunn, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson, and a 2nd round pick."
"In no particular order it's probably Quickley, the top 3 picks, Haliburton, Desmond Bane has been shooting super well, Pritchard had some great games and should be getting back from his injury soon, Tyrese Maxey was kinda balling when the sixers needed him to step up, Patrick Williams seems solid, and then Precious Achiuwa seems good whenever I see him? Idk I'm probably missing someone, but sure is 10 good rookies"
1. Precious Achiuwa 2. Jaylen Adams 3. Steven Adams 4. Bam Adebayo 5. LaMarcus Aldridge 6. Ty-Shon Alexander 7. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 8. Grayson Allen 9. Jarrett Allen 10. Al-Farouq Aminu 11.

"Yes because the rockets only wanted Herro for mvp winner James Harden 🤡🤡 you're a casual  [The Rockets asking price from Miami for James Harden included Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, two first-round picks, and 4 pick swaps.](https://twitter.com/LegionHoops/status/1349806703513100292)"
Precious achiuwa gonna pull another bam and make people look dumb again

"Precious Achiuwa is fuckin sick, I'm excited about this guy"
"It’s my go-to example for an outlandish name—God’sgift Achiuwa (played for St. John’s, older brother of Precious) is another one I reference too lol"
Precious Achiuwa. Enough said
"well except you’re wrong  https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1349771437675073546?s=20  Rockets wanted unprotected 1sts in 2025, 2027, unprotected swaps in 2026 and 2028 and Precious Achiuwa  Herro and D Robinson weren’t the reason Miami didn’t trade for Harden  edit: also 2 more pick swaps apparently"
Precious Achiuwa easily   /s
Look at the threads in this subreddit about Precious Achiuwa. This sub is just as xenophobic as it accuses Shaq of being.

Those of us from Memphis and are familiar with Wiseman's situation don't hold a grudge at all.  It was the NCAA's fault.  They cleared Wiseman to play and then later said he would need to sit out a number of games and repay monies Hardaway gave Wiseman's family for relocation.  I don't blame Wiseman at all.  Instead of bowing to the NCAA he said no.  I would rather have had him stay but it worked out in his favor considering the shortened college season.  It also gave Precious Achiuwa a chance to shine which directly led to him being drafted in the first round and if you look at the numbers I think Achiuwa has been playing a lot better than Wiseman thus far.
Precious Achiuwa
They think it’s Duncan Robinson and Precious Achiuwa
"Hell of a game and hell of a carry job with a short handed squad!   But...  Let’s also recognize the context of the fact he was dominating against a defense of Precious Achiuwa and Olynyk for a Heat team with 8 active players. He better damn well dominate that matchup, and he did that a little bit more. Doesn’t suddenly make him MVP, though."
"Nope, although Precious Achiuwa is for sure better than Jokic LOLLLL. Denver is 5-6 for a reason."
"This game has been awesome. Got Danny Green going crazy for three quarters, Tyler Herro and Joel Embiid taking over in OT, someone named Dakota hitting a shot to take the lead, Precious Achiuwa playing amazing, and potential for more of the Heat can score."
Please let us get Precious Achiuwa in action for 30 minutes tomorrow 🙏🏼
Bruh what? Precious Achiuwa is looking like the steal of the draft. We don’t have a competent center outside of Boucher so we could get him plus another draft pick for Masai to work his magic with. It’s that or Lowry walks in FA and we get nothing.
Precious Achiuwa and Peyton Pritchard would like to have a word.
"Ah yes, white Heat rookie Precious Achiuwa"
precious achiuwa is a s++ tier name
"The crazy thing is that they also have other valuable players like Kendrick nunn, who I expect to get there by the end of the season, precious achiuwa, who looks like a promising young defender, Andre iguodala, who provides veteran leadership, defense, and shooting, Myers Leonard, a strong center who can shoot threes, and mo harkless, who is a solid 3 and d player. This is after losing derick Jones jr, Jae crowder, and Solomon hill in free agency. If they were able to bring those guys back they would be 15 men deep."
Marvin Bagely or Precious Achiuwa
"I wanted Desmond Bane with the 20th pick, who is doing great in limited minutes on the Grizz bench.  However, I am very pleased with Precious Achiuwa"
He’s basically precious achiuwa lite
"They didn't start that way, but in the later half of the season it's been Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent.  Since we acquired Bjelica he's played like 3 games then disappeared, doesn't even get garbage time."
Fully healthy they also have Tyler dragic nunn Dedmon iggy dipo/Duncan bjelica precious achiuwa. Max strus has been giving great minutes kz is a good defender but has some potential offensively and gabe isn’t great but he’s a role guy who can cover if you have no one else which at times the heat havnt
Precious Achiuwa I assume
I was mildly amused by some Heat fans calling Precious Achiuwa “Sneeze”

It should be Precious Achiuwa because he went from never playing again to starting from one game to the next.
&gt; Houston’s asking price from Miami in a James Harden trade: &gt;  .. &gt; &gt; Tyler Herro  &gt; Duncan Robinson  &gt; Precious Achiuwa  &gt; Kendrick Nunn  &gt; Salary Filler  &gt; Two 1st-Round Picks  &gt; 4 Pick Swaps &gt;  ..  &gt; Miami was not interested  That is so worth James Harden for 2 fucking years guaranteed lmao. You get to keep Bam and get an instant big 3.
"has Precious looked as bad as Wiseman this year? I remember watching the 3 college games Wiseman played, and he seemed more lost out there than Achiuwa did (like he was actively getting in Precious's way, bumping into him, clogging the paint against his own teammate). I figured a year's worth of college games would've benefited Precious to the point where he'd be less raw/green than Wiseman coming into this season."
"Miami played 1/3 of the season without Butler cuz of COVID... Only three of their players have played at least 50 games as of today (Robinson, Iguodala, and Precious Achiuwa)."
Precious Achiuwa [Ben Wallace]
Precious Achiuwa.
Precious Achiuwa with one of the greats
"For Miami idk if it’s even possible for us to put together a good package without including Bam.. that being said Bam is untouchable, I’ll ship Jimmy out before I ship a hair on Bam’s buttcheek. So realistically we can give Herro, Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, picks, maybe sign and trade of Duncan Robinson if possible..   The end goal is to have Dame with Jimmy and Bam.. We’ll fill out the rest of the roster with Max Strus and some G Leaguers"
"I wanna say the Heat but after reading some of the other packages mentioned in this thread, we don’t got the juice. Best we could do is Duncan Robinson via S&amp;T, Tyler Herro, Precious Achiuwa. If we could incentivize OKC to get involved by removing the protections on the picks we owe them, it frees up draft capital to be able to send to the Wizards as well.   There are stronger offers out there though"
"The protections on the pick owed to OKC prevents Miami from trading any unconditional first round picks, which is a big reason they couldn’t get in on Harden. They will gain a 2028 pick that can be traded after the draft though, but that’s the only tradable pick they can get if they can’t get OKC to lift the protections on the 2023 pick (which OKC won’t do without good compensation).   Tyler Herro and Precious Achiuwa are their only two young trade assets. Achiuwa has little trade value and Herro’s value took a massive dip.   As a result of all this, Miami isn’t in position to get a high end star in a trade because they would be easily outbid by a number of other teams.   Only way to salvage the trade cupboard would be internal improvement from Herro and Achiuwa."
"No it wouldn’t, stop making shit up. Heat had nothing to offer that was nearly as good as the Nets package  *”But the Rockets want more. Even if the Heat offered Herro, Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, Iguodala, Olynyk and first-round picks in 2025 and 2027, I’m not sure that would be enough to satisfy the Rockets.”*  -Barry Jackson, Miami Herald"
"&gt;Dude didn’t even entertain a Herro trade for Harden even tho his best player is 31  How do you entertain a trade if there isn’t one to begin with ?

Heat don’t much in terms of picks either. The only picks they can trade are in 2025/2026.  Nets traded Levert &amp; Allen AND 3 FRPs, Allen was traded for another FRP from the Cavs.  That’s 4 FRPs + Levert in terms of valuable assets not including filler + Pick swaps.  Where in gods name do Miami come up with the Picks ? This deal could never happen realistically. The Lowry deal is much more realistic. You guys have to stop this narrative.  *”But the Rockets want more.

"If he wants to take our two 2-way players, precious achiuwa, and maybe KZ  and go on a tear in practice vs Herro-Nunn-Robinson-Ariza-Bam  Then who are we to stop him."
"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people.

"&gt;This isn't true. A team's free agent players can be sign and traded and aggregated with other players in trades. There's a random misconception that this isn't allowed for some reason. It's not always easy to arrange because the player + both teams have to agree to it, but it's allowed.  All sides have to agree to it and why the fuck would the rebuilding Blazers overpay some 27 role players just to get Herro lmao  &gt;Also not true. The Heat have all of their own future picks after this year except 2023. Also Precious Achiuwa is another decent asset that you didn't include.  You have your picks but you cant trade them caause of protections you put on them and the stepien rule since that 2023 pick will be protected until 2026 that means you can only trade either a 2027 or 2028 pick. Oh yeah sorry for excluding Precious cause he is such a massive deal breaker for Dame lmao"
"&gt;They cant include Nunn and Duncan because of sign and trade rules because they arent on the roster.  This isn't true.

It's not always easy to arrange because the player + both teams have to agree to it, but it's allowed.  &gt;The very best offer they can make is Iguodala,Dragic,Herro and a 2028 pick  Also not true. The Heat have all of their own future picks after this year except 2023. Also Precious Achiuwa is another decent asset that you didn't include.  Not saying that the heat have enough assets to trade for him (rn they definitely don't) but just wanted to point out everything you said is wrong lmao."
"There may well end up being a bigger steal than Saddiq Bey, he's just arguably not even better than the dudes who got drafted around him (Precious Achiuwa, Tyrese Maxey, Imm Quickley) because he entered the draft age 21 and was more ready."

Precious Achiuwa grew up in Nigeria
"&gt;Edit: wtf why is this the most upvoted comment lmfao  People lowkey enjoy Magic's tweets. ""That was a fantastic block by Precious Achiuwa who is a Nigerian basketball player"""
"They did lose that exhibition, and it must have been great for the Nigerian team's morale. But, KZ Okpala and Precious Achiuwa are not beating Dame and KD in a game that actually matters.   Especially since now they have something to prove"
Currently it’s precious achiuwa
"Where do you think Jahlil Okafor, Jordan Nwora, Precious Achiuwa, etc. grew up?? Still elected to play for Nigeria. Trash take."
"NBA 2K legend, Precious Achiuwa"
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
That guys name is really Precious Achiuwa? He must be a really precious player
The good: Literally nothing  The bad: You lost to josh okogie and precious achiuwa
Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent for Kevin Durant. Who says no?

"I actually heard the above news from someone I know who’s kinda close to the Nigerian team, but I also saw this on Twitter (see link below) since I wanted to make sure I wasn’t misleading anyone. That’s the official Nigerian Olympic Basketball team Twitter page (you can see it has a lot of info/photos from the training camp).   I was told guys like Gabe Vincent, Precious Achiuwa, and Jahlil Okafor would be some important pieces. Also Ike Diogu is their veteran leader (he’s played overseas a lot but was a former 1st round pick). Also I believe Jordan Nwora (who’s currently with the Bucks) might be able to make the team if he chooses to play after the Finals is over (his dad is associated with the team so my guess is he doesn’t need as many contractual stipulations).   Nigeria’s group is super balanced but I would say a team like Australia which has a core who’s played together a long time is probably better at this point, but we’ll see what happens. I am rooting for Nigeria over Australia.   https://mobile.twitter.com/NigeriaBasket/status/1409722941005258752"
"Nigeria is ranked way too high. Australia and France are definitely better. Not only is the NBA talent on Australia and France better but their players also haven’t played much with each other.   I think you are overestimating exactly which NBA players are projected to be on the Nigerian team. The best player might end up being Monte Morris and the rest of the team will be some combination of guys like Precious Achiuwa, Jahlil Okafor, and Josh Okogie."
"Warriors can add in Paschall and then that allows them to match salary to get Covington back in the trade too. Covington doesn’t have too much value after being exposed in Houston / Portland, but maybe Kerr can pull something more out of him, and it gives them someone to replace Wiggins in the rotation.   I think this is the best package for Portland. I think Simmons / Ingram packages would be shortsighted and they should focus on a more longterm rebuild and get some top draft picks as you develop Wiseman, the Warriors picks, and whatever you get for CJ (Tyler Herro and Precious Achiuwa?)"
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"Let's dispel the Herro for Harden was rejected. Harden was always going to the Nets, every other conversation was to pump up the price for the nets.

"Achiuwa: FINALLLY, PRECIOUS ACHIUWA HAS COME BACK TO TORONTO"
Starring Emma Stone as Precious Achiuwa
"Masai ""Griffith"" Ujiri  Precious ""Guts"" Achiuwa"
"Toronto is easy.  Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch  Everyone else is expiring or a project."
"&gt;It’s not. The difference between $30M/year and $25M/year is pretty significant, especially when we’re talking about a 3 year deal.   I disagree, especially since the reference to 30 was only Lowry's then-current salary.  He was never matching that on a 35+ deal.  &gt;You’re also over exaggerating how raw Precious is,  No, I'm not, he was terrible.  The Heat were 8 pts / 100 better with Achiuwa tucked safely on the bench.  &gt; He’s an off-guard. What him play basketball games.  The Heat called him a PG, and started him at that position for two years. Basketball-reference says 100% of his career minutes have been at point guard.   The Lakers sign him to be their backup point guard.  /u/DoyinYale says he's not a point.  Hmmm... tough call."
"Sure, let’s do that. Looking at just the starters for both teams, assuming DeAndre Hunter is not injured, and Precious Achiuwa starts over Khem Birch, the Hawks have an average age of 24.6 years, while the Raptors have an average age of 24.2 years. And personally, I have no qualms if the Raptors do end up being bad this year. We got our chip 3 yrs ago, must be tough having your last chip be 64 yrs ago, and even that was with only 8 teams in the league."
"Considering Lowry was moved for Precious Achiuwa, that “extra” would have to be quite the haul to make the deal worth it."
The talk so far is that they're picking up a bunch of young athletic defensive monsters and trying to [teach at least some of them to shoot](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-turning-precious-achiuwa-into-skilled-scorer) (like they did with their current core).
"Precious Achiuwa. In the Raptors development, with the type of opportunities he'll get and the older mentors he has (Baynes, Dragic, Siakam even?). Also his playstyle helps as he is a hustle guy who wants to get better. Miami would be even better for him if they were willing to start him at the 4"
My 2 answers are Hachimura and Precious Achiuwa.
MY MEMPHIS BOI PRECIOUS ACHIUWA OUT HERE BEING A GROWN MAN ON THE MF COURT MANE
"Precious ""Based on the novel Push by Sapphire"" Achiuwa is some old school Chris Berman level stuff lol"
"A GM would be fired, if he didnt hang up on Masai for offering that garbage.  The zeitgeist is that Porzingis is trash. In reality, and OP and a lot of you, should join it, he is still an excellent ballplayer.  Precious Achiuwa....smh FOH"
"He went from getting Danny Green+28th pick for Lowry to Precious Achiuwa, i don’t see the drop off."
"Well Dragic's value is pretty obvious.  His statements didn't change that.  FO knows what the offer is, they've definitely talked.  The only way it gets any 'better' is if we decide any of our prospects are actually shit and TOR doesn't see that yet.  I just don't think holding a veteran player hostage to get Precious fucking Achiuwa is a good look for a place that's already not a huge FA destination.  And trust me I know about not being a FA destination.  It's harder for y'all cuz Toronto is actually a cool ass city.  But seriously the value on this contract is not what you want it to be, and that's not Dragic's fault.  You've gotta recognize that, at least."
"PSG are taking out their Qatari checkbook as we speak. Imagine a front-line of Messi, Mbappe, Neymar and Precious Achiuwa"
Precious “Hakeem” Achiuwa
"After some development we can throw Precious in there too, he has huge defensive upside  Lmao, here’s a potential future lineup  Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa."
So now that Lowry has been traded I thought it was pretty fiasco free and we got a decent return.   20th overall pick in Precious Achiuwa and Dragic on a 20 mil dollar expiring deal. I’m happy.   Interested to see if we ride with Dragic or trade him for more assets.

"&gt;Also, on a more important note, does your username refer to Precious Achiuwa?  No"
"Is it because of the contract extension?    Also, on a more important note, does your username refer to Precious Achiuwa?"
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6’8.25”, Chris Boucher is 6’8”, Khem Birch 6’7.5”, Scottie Barnes 6’7”, Freddie Gillespie 6’9”, Dalano Banton 6’7.75”, Precious Achiuwa 6’7.5”, Yuta Watanabe 6’8”, and Sam Dekker 6’7.75”. So most of these guys would end up being 6’9” in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who’d be 6’8” in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who’d be 6’10” in shoes."
Achiuwa is precious. Like lite giannis. Just mark my words
2k21 Perennial Sixth Man Of The Year Precious Achiuwa
"Look at the team though.  Siakam: Good player, all-star caliber. Disappointed on offense. Not really a #1 option.  VanVleet: Another good player, but undersized and clearly given too much scoring responsibility last season. Needs to develop as a scorer outside of the three point line.  Powell: Traded for GTJ, an inferior player with a lot of the same issues as FVV  Lowry: Traded for Dragic, a significantly worse player.  OG Anunoby: I love OG. nothing to say here.  Boucher: Good young scorer, not sure what else to say lol  Birch: Better option at the C position than Baynes  Scottie Barnes: I think the raptors development staff will turn him good, but I don't think he'll make a huge impact this year while his jumper is still developing  Precious Achiuwa: Decent young big? Should get rotation minutes this season  That's the rotation, unless I'm missing anybody. Considering how dense the east is this year, I have very little faith in this team making the 5 seed. Decent depth but Siakam + VanVleet as a 1-2 punch is extremely underwhelming when you pit it against the teams they'll be competing against."
"Precious Achiuwa is also involved in the trade. Seems like you are just talking shit for the sake of it. Nobody really cares about what we get for Lowry except for other fanbases lol. Raps fans have moved on, and He was a free agent that was about to leave for nothing  anyways in case you forgot."
"&gt; was Maxey Green and a 1st still better than Dragic Precious and a 2nd. Green and Dragic both are coming off their deals. Dragic under contract for one more year, Green expired now.   The 1st round pick wasn't offered that's the issue. 76ers final offer was Maxey, Green, Scott and 1 second round pick. That's not the farm and frankly, that's an insulting offer at the deadline.   Dragic can be used to gain more assets, which is what will happen. Green would've likely been bought out. Maxey and Achiuwa are comparable prospects. Achiuwa provides a positional need, so that's more beneficial."
"The trade wasn't ""Miami gives Precious Achiuwa and Toronto gives Kyle Lowry"", it was ""Miami gives Goran Dragic and Precious Achiuwa and Toronto gives Kyle Lowry"". Dragic is essential for the money to work, and, since the deal isn't officialized, literally nothing is stopping Toronto from just refusing to eat up Dragic's contract if we don't accept their terms.   Achiuwa would be the compensation if Miami had cap. They do not, so they need to offload Dragic to Toronto. Toronto can refuse to take Dragic if they want. It isn't rocket science, Miami needs Dragic on the trade and Toronto will accept it only with a 3rd team involved. No 3rd team, no Dragic. No Dragic, can't sign Lowry."
Aren't we getting Precious Achiuwa? I thought that guy could play C too.
"They should do a full rebuild imo and trade Siakam,Vanvleet and Boucher  OG,Gary Trent Jr,Precious Achiuwa,Scottie Barnes and whatever they get from Siakam,FVV and Boucher sounds like a good young core"
Precious Achiuwa and Goran Dragic
"Didn’t you get Precious Achiuwa?  Khem Birch, lol"

“It’s probably a different Achiuwa they are trading”  -precious
Does that mean they value whoever they can sign using the MLE more than precious Achiuwa?
"I imagine Miami calls up the team, say that they’re working on a Precious Achiuwa trade with Toronto that they’re trying to expand into a three team trade with Dragic going elsewhere and that they have Masai on speakerphone. They just say Toronto will give up something undecided for Achiuwa and Dragic to Miami, and that they’re looking for a third team to take Dragic.  As none of the players are free agents, no tampering is involved in discussing this trade, so everything is very legal and very cool."
"&gt; Lowry has long been intrigued with joining Heat star Jimmy Butler and the Miami organization, and now Miami has maneuvered to have two key elements of a possible sign-and-trade package -- guard Goran Dragic and forward Precious Achiuwa -- to offer the Raptors once talks can ensue at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, sources said.  &gt; The Heat picked up the option on Dragic's $19.4 million contract for the 2021-2022 season, making him an ideal contractual fit to include in talks to make a deal possible with the Raptors. A market exists for the Raptors to move Dragic, 35, onto a new team, including the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans, sources said.  &gt; Achiuwa, a well-regarded 2020 first-round pick out of the University of Memphis, showed significant promise in his rookie season and would serve as a sweetener to Toronto to facilitate a sign-and-trade deal, sources said.

"The assumption would be that it gets us at least one asset like Precious Achiuwa or a first round pick. Maybe both if we can bargain hard enough. Then they can try to flip Dragic to another team. Or maybe they’ve figured out that the guys they’re targeting in free agency with big offers (Jarrett Allen, Lonzo Ball are rumored examples) are going elsewhere. So then Dragic is a solid vet on an expiring deal that can be moved at the deadline to a team that wants to add some depth for the playoffs."

I don't see how that's everyone when you could have Harden, Bam, Butler, and Dragic (at the time). That would have done a whole lot better in this past playoffs and you ended up losing Nunn and trading Achiuwa anyway."

"I dont think they are in purgatory but their timeline is kind of weird. The young players they have that are 24 years old or younger are OG Anunoby,Gary Trent Jr,Scottie Barnes,Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn, OG and Gary are already starting level players,Scottie is a project who has star potential and both Flynn and Precious looked good in summer league and could develop well. Imo thats a fringe top 10 young core  Its just that on top of those guys they also have a bunch of win now players who dont really have time to develop like Siakam,Fred,Boucher,Dragic and Birch who would rather win now"
I know Precious Achiuwa played soccer and he's still good at it. This is all I know lmao
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
"&gt; Ignoring the contradiction in calling the team ""talent-starved"" when they have OG, Siakam and VanVleet plus promising young players in Trent Jr., Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa, if it involves trading Fred along with Boucher, Dragic and a first, then I am absolutely not in favor of it.  They are 100% high end talent starved.   OG, Trent Jr. Scottie and precious are all good role players or show promise. FVV is a really good guard but not quite all star. Siakam with no injuries is an all star except he's coming off injury.   This team replaced Lowry, Kawhi, Ibaka/Gasol with noone of similar value. We completely lack high end talent. We have no first start, we have no leader like the way Lowry was. We have no quality centers like Ibaka/Gasol. Our Center rotation right now is just good backup centers being played as starters.   Pascal is coming off injury,  his ramp up to game shape will take a while and the jury is still out if he can ever become an all star again. He willl no doubt struggle on a team without a true point guard in the starting lineup. FVV is not a point guard. He's a shooting guard in a point guards body.   I won't argue how good of a shooter FVV is. but he isn't really a leader and he isn't a playmaker. and he's streaky prone to hero ball espeacilly with even less talent around him.   I see Ben brining playmaking, defense and scoring on this team. He has shown he can do that in the regular season and is only 24.   Do i want to trade the whole kitchen sink for him? No but you would be absolutely the biggest homer ever if you don't think he could bring value to this team if we didn't give up too much for him.  He would instantly help Siakam, and FVV if we could keep him in a trade.  Salary wise? cap space means nothing in Toronto since we will never attract a big FA. We need to find our stars in trades or drafting.  I want to stress, for the right price, Ben is a great get for this team."

Fred is our second-best shooter Pascal (arguably he's our most efficient shooter from the 3), an offensive threat and a natural leader.  With Lowry gone, that last factor is going to become more important, and I don't see Ben bringing that leadership to the Raptors, let alone being our first, second or even third option on offense unless Nick Nurse and our staff can work on his ""pass first"" apprehension to shooting.  And even then, I'm not optimistic about our chances of ""fixing"" Ben Simmons."
"Not at all, I didnt want to trade Achiuwa either, I think he has a ton of potential but not anything near the potential as Herro.  If you seriously believed that the Heat were open letting the Raptors pick between Herro or Precious then you will believe anything."
They got Precious Achiuwa from the Heat
"In contrast, Precious Achiuwa still hosted a back-to-school event in Miami after getting traded to Toronto"
Thank you! And Precious Achiuwa isn't that hard to say either.
"In 2K, the Giannis team would for sure sweep. Precious Achiuwa, Giannis and Bol Bol would kill the simulation. That's a freaking dynasty.  IRL, I'll give the Giannis team an edge in 6. I think Collins and PG13 could steal a couple, but I can't see them winning any more than that."
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"For Miami, it’s Michael Beasley, Justise Winslow, and possibly Precious Achiuwa (maybe too soon to call, but we traded him after only one season)."
"Toronto is in a transitionary period, but the question is whether they got more worse than the Hornets got better?  The Raptors guard rotation is weaker than the Hornets', though I think you are overestimating Ball slightly and underestimating VanVleet slightly.  I think its hard to argue that the Hornets frontcourt is better, Siakam and OG are more versatile options than Washington/Hayward; and I have no confidence that Hayward will stay healthy long enough to revert back to old Hayward and make it a contest between him and Pascal.  Centre is basically a wash between each team.  Last year the Hornets won 6 more games than the Raptors.   The respective factors in their issues were Lamelo's Injury and Hayward's for the Hornets.  COVID absences, Pascal/Kyle injuries and playing ~70 away games for the Raptors.  We lose Kyle over the offseason, gain Scottie Barnes, Dragic and Precious Achiuwa, likely a net negative in win shares.  Hornets get Oubre, Plumlee, Bouknight and Kai Jones, I would score that as neutral, maybe +2 win shares.  My confidence comes from believing that a healthy Raptors team that gets to play out of Toronto increases wins by 8-10. Whether that is enough remains to be seen, any gap in projected wins is made up by homerism.  My greater point is that you refer to teams getting significantly better in the last 2 years, for the Hornets their improvement is Lamelo Ball, Hayward and improvement from Rozier. In the last 4 years they finish 10th, 9th, 10th and 10th in the East. Their success this year depends on Lamelo growth, Rozier maintenance/growth and Hayward health, none of their acquisitions are big needle movers.  I don't think they belong in the conversation about why the Raptors no longer figure into the Playoff picture. And as for the Raptors not being contenders, that's pretty clear, but not because the Hornets are a juggernaut.  My confidence in 100 out of 100 matchups is just me saying if I was putting money on the head to head matchup, I'm taking the Raps."
"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That’s not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."

"I have lasting images of Scottie Barnes, Chris Boucher, &amp; Khem Birch/Precious Achiuwa murdering us on the offensive glass  As well as Gary Trent Jr. getting to the rim at will on us"
We got Matthews and   Precious Achiuwa?
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
"I’m actually kinda excited to watch the Raptors play this year, I’m been curious about how a 5-man lineup of Scottie Barnes, OG, Siakam, Precious Achiuwa &amp; Khem Birch will do on the court, especially on defense."
Precious Achiuwa.  A solid center rotation is key for Nurse’s offensive and defensive schemes…
It’s the same thing every time. Raptors fans just pissed they only got Dragic and Precious Achiuwa and want to believe Lowry is the difference between a 2nd round exit and a guaranteed championship for the Sixers lol. It’s the same shit in every thread.
I was also confused when I saw Precious Achiuwa draining pull up 3's off the dribble.
"It's probably more wise to lean on Birch's experience, and consider pre-season to be a not-so-great warmup for him.  Precious is going into his second year in the league, and Birch has already shown his value as a starter at the end of last season.  But I think the transition from Birch to Achiuwa won't take more than a couple months (baring injury)."
"Birch had Covid though, possibly affected by that. Birch was so much better  last year for the Raptors than Achiuwa was for the heat that Precious will need to take a major step forward to take the starting role."

"Honestly after watching the Raptors today, I'd go all-in on a Fred/Ben swap.  I think they're going to struggle to make serious noise without a genuine superstar player but I think you can sometimes get around that by being different and they have the potential to be really different.   No hate against Fred, he's a great player, but they're already a very big and switchable lineup and I'd lean into that size and switchability and hope to strike gold.  Watching Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa playing as well as they did has me feeling like they could just throw caution to the wind.  Simmons / Anunoby / Barnes / Siakam / Achiuwa  Spacing is an obvious concern but I think there's potential there for the team to be insanely weird and dynamic."

The Precious Achiuwa Game
Precious Achiuwa was Anthony Bennett for the entire first half and Anthony Davis in the 3rd quarter.
"&gt;He’s a rookie who went off in summer league  That right there is the issue. Summer league means nothing cause you're battling with other players trying to earn roster spots with the G league team. Naturally you're going to look great against that competition if you're a hyped lottery draft pick. Feels like people have unnatural expectations based off a great 4 games in the summer and think that'll translate to the NBA offense.   Case in point, Precious Achiuwa looked like god in summer league, looked average to below average against NBA level defences.   Ppl need to adjust their expectations and understand that summer league rookie performances don't translate to NBA where you're literally playing against the 400 top players in the world."

"You gotta be braindead man. You think NOP would take Satoransky, Temple, and a SRP over fucking Simmons if Morey pushed for it??? 6ers would've got Lonzo and picks back if they wanted, too. Those picks could also be used for asset management.  We know Miami tampered, yet we also know the 6ers had an opportunity to get Lowry. Which, on that note, another complete bone headed mistake by Morey. Lowry has literally transformed the Heat offense, and he is, again, a perfect PG for the 6ers. Maxey, Thybulle, and a pick would've been enough and would've been totally worth it. Morey cheaped out and got beat by fucking Precious Achiuwa lmaoooo"
Precious Achiuwa would be crying in the car after practise if he was on the same team as Kobe.
"Raps fans too.  I'm glad we got *something* for Lowry in a S&amp;T, but a deal based around Precious Achiuwa is significantly less appealing than one based around Tyrese Maxey (from Philly) or Horton-Tucker.   We had the most valuable asset at the trade deadline and held onto him because two win-now contenders refused to give up young guys who barely played in the playoffs. Big missed opportunity all around."
Fun fact: Precious Achiuwa was based on the novel 'Push' by Sapphire

We will no longer tolerate precious achiuwa slander for the next...6 hours
"The heat being good now does not disprove they were ""bubble frauds"". They added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker and Victor Oladipo. While also taking away Goran Dragic, Precious Achiuwa and Kendrick Nunn. They aren't the same team anymore."
"- Tyler Herro (currently averaging 22.4/6/4.4, leading bench scorer in the NBA)  - Duncan Robinson (extended, enables extensive spacing for two stars who can't shoot even if he's in a slump)  - Precious Achiuwa (used in trade to acquire Kyle Lowry)  - Kendrick Nunn (let go for nothing)  - Salary Filler (would've likely been Goran Dragic &amp; Andre Iguodala, one of which was used in the Lowry trade)  - Two 1st-Round Picks (likely 2022/2024)  - 4 Pick Swaps   this is the king's ransom they asked for Harden."
"the point is that james harden's net impact would not have made up for the loss of all houston wanted for him (that we **DID NOT HAVE ANYWAY**)   now, it's nearly a whole season later -- james harden is struggling, precious achiuwa and goran dragic (**TWO PIECES WHO WOULD'VE LEFT FOR HARDEN**) were exchanged for kyle lowry (who has been phenomenal), and tyler herro is having a breakout year -- not to mention the picks we managed to hold onto that houston wanted  miami won the hypothetical"

The minute Precious Achiuwa stepped off the court they started playing like Peak Warriors
"Thanks for the insight. Didn't see any of the Suns gleague games and his stats looked solid.   Right now for the Raptors, Precious Achiuwa has great stats but takes bad shots out of the flow of the offense and drives head down everytime. No chance of a pass at all. But they are giving him constant chances to figure it out  Poor Frank is always the whipping boy. He has had a much longer career than i ever thought. Saric injure was brutal for the Suns last year"
He averages nearly 6 potential assists per game the issue has more to do with guys like Khem Birch and Precious Achiuwa just not catching the ball and finishing plays. Comparing him to Magic Johnson may be a bit of a hyperbole but he definitely will be an above average playmaker in his prime.
