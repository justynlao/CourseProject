Knocked out by Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker. Ooft
"They were 3rd string guys who played some second string minutes because of injury. Mason Jones and Jae'Sean Tate look like they could start on Tuesday, and Kenyon Martin Jr would arguably be the most exciting rookie we've had since Sam Dekker if if weren't for the two in front of him."
"Right.  The average NBA career ends by 31, for sure.  Most players lose a step in their mid/late 20s, and in the NBA, most players can't afford it.  Random examples, but Shabazz Napier is 29.  Lance Stephenson is 30.  Greg Monroe is 30.  Yogi Farrell, Ron Baker, and Sam Dekker look done at 27."
Sam dekker says hello there’s a reason Morey always traded away our picks ha
Think there was an article not too long ago about players not liking Sam Dekker (maybe another player?) for being pro-trump
Is Sam Dekker still in the NBA?
Idk man theres just something about those guys that i really identify with. Oh Grayson Allen and Sam Dekker too!
I agree. It used to piss me off. I remember Sam dekker and Montrezl playing all year but come playoffs we had a 7 man rotation and they got 0 burned. Dude runner down players a lot.
"Fuckin Wisconsin, Sam Dekker, and I'm still conflicted with Kaminsky."
"I don’t think you’re a bust if you can carve out a sustained period as a role players. It’s not like he was Thabeet, Adam Morrison, or Sam Dekker level busts"
"2nd worst fastbreak ever, closely behind the man, the myth, the legend, Sam Dekker."
"born and raised in Ohio, got to go see us get pummeled by Frank Kaminsky &amp; Sam Dekker in the 2014-2015 season, but I loved D-Lo."
I wonder what Rockets legend Sam Dekker is up to nowadays.
Not as good as Sam Dekker
What is Sam Dekker doing now?
"It seems like everyone always rewriting reality on here lmao. From the way people talk about him you’d think Kemba is the Bronx Sam Dekker. He was an all star literally last year, and averaged 19/4/5 over 17 playoff games. He’s probably having the worst 10 game stretch since his rookie season and all of a sudden he’s always been a bad player on a bad contract."
Mfs was talking bout deni being the next luka. More like sam dekker.
"For perspective, NBA superstars Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker carried there Wisconsin team to an NCAA championship where they lost to a squad of absolute league legends Jahlil Okafor, Justice Winslow, Tyus Jones, and Quinn Cook."
"""On June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations.""... yes he ""joined"" him...  ""On July 16, 2019, the Houston Rockets traded Paul, 2024 and 2026 first round picks, and 2021 and 2025 second round pick swaps to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Russell Westbrook.""... yes... also ""joined"" him"
"They got picks from Brooklyn and Milwaukee, which will likely be in the late 20s. They just got off of Oladipo, so I don't see much that they really got for Harden, who is likely a top 50 player of all time.  Objectively, any package including a surefire star like Simmons is better. Houston had to trade for Harden and has a pretty underwhelming [draft record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Houston_Rockets_first_and_second_round_draft_picks).  (Their last first round draft pick, Sam Dekker, only lasted in the league for 4 seasons...)  For an organization with such a poor draft record, I would not consider these picks worth a whole lot."
Clearly forgetting about the snipers that Luis Scola and Sam dekker were (joke)
"His transactions list is impressive:   June 24, 2004: Drafted by the New York Knicks in the 2nd round (43rd pick) of the 2004 NBA Draft.

"Then say that   Sam Dekker saying im proud to be white and I’m proud to be American are two different statements   Black is sorta of an ethnicity in America with slavery and everything they’ve overcome as a group that’s something to be proud of   I can’t honestly say the same for white, I’d just use American"
🤢 like this for not giving sam dekker his due....
"Also, could be an amazing year for lottery teams that have had shit luck (Detroit, Orlando). I searched up the past draft picks for the rockets... the last lottery pick for Houston? Jeremy Lamb, in 2012, pick 12. They haven't even selected a guy in the first round since 2015, where they got Sam Dekker."
*sad Sam Dekker noises*
The UK squad that couldn’t even beat the  Wisconsin team led by legends Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker?
"Alex Caruso, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kevin Love, Gordon Hayward, Sam Dekker etc"
Like they did with KAT and Ant? Foh with your Sam Dekker pick
Just saw someone wearing a sam dekker jersey that might take the cake for most random jersey sighting
Can't believe D Book and KAT got eliminated by Frank the Tank and Sam Dekker
"I only remember Sam Dekker because he married sportscaster Olivia Harlan Dekker, the daughter of Kevin Harlan."
It doesn’t even capture it well enough. The athmosphere gets 10x crazier than the video shows. There are numerous quotes(ex-NBA Alan Williams and Sam Dekker were the last ones I remember) talking about how you are scared shitless to go through the tunnel under the stands.
Sam Dekker tripping and hitting himself in the face with the ball
"I’ll expose myself. When the T-Wolves had the #1 pick that they used on KAT, I wanted them to trade back for 2 firsts and take WCS and Sam Dekker. Woof thank god I wasn’t the GM."
Ya Sam Dekker was absolutely shredding book on both ends lol.
As an Arizona alum I hate Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker with all of my heart. I hope Dekker is an enterprise rent a car manager.
Sam Dekker sends his regards
"Random, but I was a 5th grader in Madison when the Badgers made that run in 2015. Frank the Tank, Sam Dekker, and Nigel Hayes made an appearance at our school field day and Kaminsky had to crouch a bit to walk around our building.  We had a karaoke setup in the schools band room (my dad was the karaoke host, it's his job), I have a video of me and my dad singing Build me up buttercup with them"
Sam Dekker was dominating those fools not Frank
Anytime I see Kaminsky I think of how JR said Sam Dekker is the only teammate he ever hated.
Just sign Nigel Hayes and Sam Dekker to celebrate on the end of the bench with Frank the Tank. All scrub three.
Sam Dekker the goat
Sam Dekker
"That's not all the way fair. Morey only traded for 2 established superstars in his tenure w/the Rox, CP3(awesome) and Russ(not awesome). D12 was a free agent, and Beard wasn't a superstar when we traded for him. So which players did he trade that you cared about so much, and which superstar did you not want?  Unless you're yearning for the days of the post-TMac/Yao era of the treading water Rox, then you can't hate on the Harden trade at all if you even want to count that one. FWIW I loved Scola, Brooks, KMart, Chuck, KLow, Dragic, etc.  1. In order to get CP3, Morey traded Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations. I still adore Pat Bev and Trezz, and I got love for LouWill, but that CP3 trade led to the greatest non-Hakeem led team in franchise history. It's undeniable that trade was amazing, and even if you hate CP3, it was the best move for the team. I cared more about team success at that point than how much I missed Pat Bev and Trezz, and I became a CP3 fan.  2. I agree with you on the Russ trade tho, and I hated it in real time but tried to stay positive. We all saw how that worked out, and I still miss CP3. But that trade was on Frittata and Harden 100%, and I can't be convinced Morey wanted Russ especially at the cost of those picks. It is what it is, but Morey makes moves to get better, and he's generally on point unless the owner is a cheap bastard who takes out $200 million loans at like 35% lmao"
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
the sam dekker special
"Is this a hot take? We re-signed GTJ and Birch but those were givens, we got a good young guy and someone who doesn’t wanna be here for Lowry, and our big free agency acquisitions were Sam Dekker and Ishmail Wainright. Our draft was a success imo, but I can’t say that we had a good FA."
"What??? Sam Dekker, Ishmael Wainright and Anas Osama were brilliant signings!!!!  Seriously though I don't really understand the direction the team is going. I know they wanted to do right by Kyle and get him where he wanted to go and achewa is a great get but now it looks like they are stuck with Dragic.   Then their young players basically play the same positions as their core players but the depth around the core is lacking because theyre also young players and unproven players.   I know you guys don't get FAs so wouldn't the right move to be to move on from Siakums huge deal why teams are enamered. Get some assets and open up some minutes for the young guys and let Van Vleet lead the team?"
Can't believe Sam Dekker didnt have a career performance to bail out Harden yet againb
To be fair Sam Dekker was playing to the best of his very limited abilities
&gt;none of his teammates deserve blame.  Clint Capela: 3-11  Eric Gordon: 2-9  Ryan Anderson: 0-6  Lou Williams: 3-7  Sam Dekker: 2-6
Sam Dekker fast break
I wish we'd being him in for training camp/SL instead of Sam Dekker
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6’8.25”, Chris Boucher is 6’8”, Khem Birch 6’7.5”, Scottie Barnes 6’7”, Freddie Gillespie 6’9”, Dalano Banton 6’7.75”, Precious Achiuwa 6’7.5”, Yuta Watanabe 6’8”, and Sam Dekker 6’7.75”. So most of these guys would end up being 6’9” in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who’d be 6’8” in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who’d be 6’10” in shoes."
Sam Dekker is the pickup. Here’s why.
Wasn't that Sam Dekker
"lol, why did we brink back Sam dekker? Is this for real?"
"Sam Dekker, played well in Euroleague, can't see that play continuing here. /s"
Sam Dekker
"Sam Dekker.  Didn't see the serious tag. Hopefully Zion or Cade is that NBA Face of the league.  My honorable mention will be Ant Edwards. Super likable kid, just needs experience."
Sam Dekker is so bad

Yep. Sam fucking Dekker. I’d rather have herpes
Sam Dekker.
Sam Dekker?!?
Sam dekker is the pick up and here’s why:
"Nothing he says alludes to them having a prior conversation about the N word. In the initial interview he says dekker was “talking some trump shit”.   Dekker denies that he’s a trumper, his wife calls JR a liar, and then JR tweets some shit about the N word in a way that obviously implies that dekker says it or wants to say it before walking it back in the next tweet.  And I don’t think it’s fair to compare Sam dekker, an nba player who obviously is familiar with working and living close to African American men, to a random “edgelord”"
"he went to my high school and his dad was one of my middle school teachers... Sam Dekker is like the Lebron James of Sheboygan, WI"
Bill worrel had the line “sam with the triple dekker” when he pulls up from 3
I mean Sam Dekker is cool and all lol but come on!
You’re telling me. Our one FA pickup has been Sam Dekker
Dekker as in Sam Dekker? Lol really? That's a name I haven't heard in awhile. What's Nik Stauskas up to nowadays?
"Sam dekker is from Sheboygan which is like a 50,000 person town, 85% white, and entirely republican controlled. Idk why I’m getting downvoted for not being surprised he could theoretically be a conservative"
I’ve not heard of Sam Dekker in what feels like 2 years. Wtf happened to that guy
Sam Dekker was still in the league?
Raptors just signed Sam Dekker to the same exact contract lol at least Hood has proven he is NBA caliber before
Holy shit Sam Dekker coming back to nba and will join the  raptors
Sam Dekker brought in for Euroleague hard fouls
lol Sam Dekker??!?!?!?  I remember this dude.
Those YT accounts kill me lol  “Sam Dekker = Nikola Jokic??”
Oh no Sam Dekker is back..
Sam Dekker is the next Raptors star and here is why
Wisconsin legend Sam Dekker
"The Rockets turned  Pat Beverley, Harrel, Sam Dekker, and Lou Williams into John Wall,  and the Wizards turned John Wall into Kuzma, Harrel, KCP, and Aaron Holiday."
"They were a defensive team and Culver seemed like the only spark on offense with great defense. Furthermore, tournament performance don't indicate shit. Fran Kaminsky and Sam Dekker had absolutely brilliant runs and were drafted high because of it. Now, one can't even get a look for an NBA roster."
Never forget Sam Dekker 30 pts
Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker. 😬
Sam Dekker
That one where Sam Dekker fell and bounced the ball of his face instantly comes to mind
If the Suns had Sam Dekker it would be over
"Either Sam Dekker or Goran Dragic probably, even though both seemed to increase their stock with the fanbase"
Sam Dekker

"Frank Kaminsky. Actually, I really liked that whole Wisconsin team -- Bronson Koenig, Nigel Hayes, Sam Dekker -- and how they played. A shame that none of them ever panned out."
Dwight Howard and Sam Dekker
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
It's a training camp battle between Sam Dekker and Svi Mykhailiuk on who gets the rights to be called the new Matt Thomas
"KAT has been soft since college. I went to UK watch every game the fact he couldn't produce against sorry ass Frank Kaminsky and Sam ""Who"" Dekker in the final four he showed who he is.  Joel owns KAT, he's so far in his head he tries to fight him every time they play and that right there is why he is a tier below. He's soft mentally, I'm sure other people in the league have had family die but it didn't require tweets and sob stories. It's just another excuse for a dude that fails to step up."
"That’s Raptors legend Sam Dekker to you, sir."
Sam Dekker
he was busy scouting sam dekker
Sam Dekker shoots 28% from three
We just got one in Sam Dekker.  We had one in Matt Thomas last season (now on the Bulls)  Got both of em from Europe. There’s bare shooters over there. Better to do that than pay Shamet *this* much.
"Who are the white athletes that have any clout in the league that aren’t vaccinated? Sam Dekker?   Why do you keep making something not about race, about race? It is about getting vaccinated. Kyrie comes off as nuts. No one is stating what they are actually “researching”.   I’m sorry, but idiots are idiots and intellectuals are intellectuals. Race doesn’t matter."
Didn't JR say the one teammate he hated was Sam Dekker for being a Trump Supporter? Ironic how he praises an icon for their movement.
"A lot of people on the Raptors sub keep hating on Sam Dekker since he was accused of being a White Supremacist by JR Smith.  I hope this shows them, that it isn't exactly a bright idea to trust anything that comes out of JR Smiths mouth."
"Not their fault, they went up against Sam ""Steph Curry"" Dekker"
Sam Dekker is back in the NBA?
Sam dekker looks so different with the beard.

Barely recognized him. Wasn't even sure it was the same Sam Dekker who was out of the league a few years ago.
"1. We are not contending this year. Let’s not pretend that Sam Dekker is the make it or break it between winning another championship or not. It’s not that deep.  2. When you’re looking at someone of Dekker’s caliber, we’re talking end of bench bonus minutes. We’re not talking FVV, KAT, Beal, etc. Though I personally dislike it, there might be more of an argument for disregarding those types of views if we’re talking about a player that consistently makes impact/leads the team. That’s not the case with Dekker. So in his case, what’s the upside in ignoring it? All you would do is upset your team (and those players that DO make impact/lead the team) by introducing such an unnecessary controversial viewpoint to your locker room.  And 3. Masai *does not* fuck around when it comes to allegations of racial discrimination. If there’s an exec out there that’s chill with someone genuinely linked to white supremacy, it sure as fuck won’t be the guy who was a very public victim of racial discrimination on the world stage, and in one of the biggest moments of his career. The man dealt with lawsuits for multiple years after the incident from the finals, and is a very outspoken advocate for equality. This is true for him in both a personal and a professional capacity. What you’re suggesting would go directly against that. If Dekker gets a spot, I would have full faith that it was something Masai looked into and deemed to be untrue."
They weren’t fake lol so u think JR has nothing better to do than lying to make Sam Dekker of all people look bad
"I can see the booty from the bottom, that thing come double decker And if a white boy shoot on that thing, he Sam Dekker"
[I still want to know if this guy’s trip to LA after a Sam Dekker tweet was legit](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8r790q/sam_dekker_white_pride_tweet_prompts_twitter/)
Sam Dekker is a beast man. Rockets legand
Sam Dekker is back??
"https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/jr-smith-sam-dekker-teammate-trump/1a04wiwqul1219rkd6t1l43j0  Make sure you read the whole thing, especially the end. It makes it clear that JR was talking out of his ass."
yo why does sam dekker have 18 pts in 9 min
Is sam dekker the goat?
kyle kuzma getting WORKED by sam dekker lmaooo
"Tbh as much as we could use a bit of extra shooting, I don't think we ultimately should keep Sam Dekker. Ishmail Wainwright has all the right vibes but he's also older. Ultimately I'd like to see if we can do more with Bonga. Feel like he's overall better as a backup to the backups. I'd also not mind converting Champagnie to a full spot but no need to rush for that. I also think we don't absolutely need a 15-man roster. Would prefer to pick up a random heavy big for situational minutes like a Okafor."
TIL Sam Dekker plays for the raptors
Honestly really happy with how all the young guys played. Put together some really exciting pass-first plays leading to easy buckets and Barnes is an absolute fan favourite already.   Sam Dekker however showed why he’s been out of the league for a while and should stay out of the league…
"Sam dekker played in D5 (for those not in Wisconsin, D1 is highest level for HS sports) and his second best teammate was 5’8. Hilarious to watch him play in state tournament."
shameless pointless fact: My high school team played Sam Dekker in his high school days for the state semifinals
"Sam Dekker is a recent example, just got back in the NBA with the Raptors."
Diamond Stone (if that counts) and Kevon Looney are also Milwaukee boys. Sam Dekker and Henry Ellenson are also Wisconsin boys.
sam dekker and a medium fry
Sam Dekker has always been super right wing. I grew up not far from where he grew up and attended UW the same time. We don't have to cap for a dude who just got cut and will be back playing in Russia
"From JR Smith:  &gt; Throughout my whole career, it’s only one teammate I really don’t like. And he know that. And everybody else, I’m just cool with. This dude Sam Dekker, dog. I can’t – this dude. He did some bulls— on the bus one day, talking some Trump s—, and I just wasn’t having it"
"JR Smith on Sam Dekker:   &gt; Throughout my whole career, it’s only one teammate I really don’t like. And he know that. And everybody else, I’m just cool with. This dude Sam Dekker, dog. I can’t – this dude. He did some bulls— on the bus one day, talking some Trump s—, and I just wasn’t having it.  So downvote and tell em to stfu all you want but it looks like they're probably right."
"I remember it like it was yesterday: Sam Dekker for Chris Paul, 3 FRP and 6.9 million in cash considerations."
Sam Dekker is everything you can imagine. Fuck him indeed
