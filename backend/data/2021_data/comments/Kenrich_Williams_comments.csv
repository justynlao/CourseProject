"What was questionable was Kenrich Williams' Dallas Shag haircut aka the ""Let me get a soggy diaper hanging off the back of my neck."" Can't forget Diallo showboating down 28 by posing after a 3 and then talking trash to the Rockets bench."
"Just don't ask us about our SFs after Ingram. It's like 115 games of Trevor Ariza, the hustle of the undrafted rookie and sophomore Kenrich Williams, or the last grasps of Peja Stojakovic's prime. And everybody else is either really bad or not a small forward."
I have fallen in love with Kenrich Williams. Dude just goes out there and hustles for the team
TIL someone named Kenrich Williams is on the Thunder
"The assets they gave up for Adams were George Hill, Darius Miller (injured), Kenrich Williams (who I like), a lottery protected Denver 1st, and a couple of 2nds. And Adams has been such an improvement. Aside from Boogie, he's been our best C since Tyson Chandler. I'd do that trade again.       Besides, his extension is actually a price drop from this year."
Yoooooo that‚Äôs what the fuck is up Shai is up Dort is hella up Roby is up Kenrich Williams is up Thunder is UP tho
Kenrich Fucking Williams though
Kenrich Williams is all over the floor...
"I have to accept I don‚Äôt know Kenrich Williams. But boy, he‚Äôs a good find for OKC."
no it happened after kenrich williams or someone blocked him (plus he was playing annoying full court defense on him) and so he went all do you dare question the king on him for a while
what the fuck is kenrich williams
Yo what the fuck is Kenrich Williams hair

"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that‚Äôs not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I‚Äôm perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can‚Äôt let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It‚Äôs early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that‚Äôs completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala‚Äôs three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don‚Äôt want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that‚Äôs just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn‚Äôt really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"
Bro how tf did the Thunder turn Kenrich Williams into a good role player
"Yea man I‚Äôm totally with you. I loved rooting hard for guys like Randle, Cheick Diallo (idk where tf he even is now), Frank Jackson, Kenrich Williams, etc.  There‚Äôs definitely a special connection you grow with a team during that time."
"You could also make an undrafted team from that draft of Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Kenrich Williams, Jae'Sean Tate and one of Yuta/McLaughlin/Gabriel."
You need Jrue Holiday to beat a garbage tanking team missing 3 rotation players with Justin Jackson and Kenrich Williams starting? Lol
The Kenrich Williams tour continues

&gt;Kenrich Williams   Kenrich Williams update
No kenrich Williams mention in the thunder v. Lakers game??üò≠
"I edited my comment but I should‚Äôve said from the games he doesn‚Äôt play our defense clearly takes a big hit.   First game against Chicago can‚Äôt get stops until late in the game, end up winning by 2.  Detroit we let Blake Griffin look like he‚Äôs in his prime, get dominated and lose by double digits   OKC looked like they were having there way till the 4th quarter, Shai, Kenrich Williams, Diallo, Bazley, Horford all just having there way in the paint.   Him out definitely leaves a big whole in our defense. Teams don‚Äôt fear attacking the rim and get what they want"

Because no one is easy these days when you have guys like Kenrich Williams dropping career highs on you lol.
Kenrich Williams has a career high because why not lol
again who the fuck is Kenrich Williams
is kenrich williams better mid range shooter than prime michael jordan?
Why does it looks like Kenrich Williams has a durag made of hair? That's like a worse version of a mullet or something.
Ah yes.. Kenrich Williams. Dude would probably have 4 points if it was the Grizzlies lol.

&gt; Pay ATTENTION TO KENRICH WILLIAMS. Kenny hustle. This guy plays winning basketball. Do not snooze on this man.  Dude was literally always in the right spot for a rebound. It felt like he got 5-6 offensive rebounds and constantly kept OKC's momentum from slipping.
"Takeaways:  That one hurt man. Fuck it though. Young OKC took it to em  Hamidou Diallo is way too tough  Bazley pros: he won a critical game saving jump ball against Lebron and got boards. Bazley cons: he tries to do way too much  Pay ATTENTION TO KENRICH WILLIAMS. Kenny hustle. This guy plays winning basketball. Do not snooze on this man.   Shai hoops. That fucking step back with four mins to go in the fourth was insane. Really awesome to get to the line and go 3/3 at the end of regulation  Lebron so fucking good it‚Äôs crazy. Just an unimaginable passer and just tossed our guys around. Such a scary shooter  The refs called a lot of BULLSHIT on Luguentz Dort. Hate to see it   Forgot how quick Dennis hits the jets. He adds such a layer of dynamism to the Lakers on offense   Okc needs size so bad. Cannot stop Trez, he got what he wanted. Anytime Baze was on him he was toast    Good ass job Okc.

Kenrich Williams is better than all of these guys IMO
Kenrich Williams arguably has been our third best player too. Amazing hustle picking up steals charges and rebounds. Runs our bench offense well and scores super efficiently. Glad we got him for a few more years
yeah he is now the best uninjured/sitting player on the team (all injuries/people sitting taken into account) when he started the year as the worst player in the league. Maybe Kenrich williams is better still

Patty Mills, De‚ÄôAnthony Melton, Kenrich Williams, and Norman Powell all have a higher PPP than Steph, Harden and Dame. I highly doubt you‚Äôd consider any of these guys better isolation scorers than the players we‚Äôre discussing. Not even you believe that."

"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of ‚Äúwhy are you taking picks away from TC when he‚Äôs so good at using them!‚Äù And other fans were saying ‚Äúbut we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!‚Äù  I‚Äôve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that‚Äôs not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"

"We ran a heliocentric ""offense"" that empowered Russ &amp; KD to everyone else's detriment. This year's players get to do so much more with the ball.

"Totally valid from Toronto's perspective, but from the Philly side that's 3 rotation players plus Maxey. A 3 for 1 would be tough on Philly's depth, even if two of those three are quite replaceable. Philly's only remaining wings would be...Simmons, Korkmaz, Curry, Isaiah Joe, and Terrance Ferguson. One reliable player, two one-way shooters who will get targeted in the playoffs, a rookie 2nd rounder and a guy who'll be out of the league in six months.   If you turned it into a 3-team trade with, say, OKC, and Philly sends out a pick and also gets George Hill and, like, Kenrich Williams, then it's worth it for the Sixers."
Kenrich Williams won this game in the beginning of the fourth. Normally our bench unit bullies opponents but we got bullied.
Kenrich Williams is everywhere this quarter.
"He also did it playing against an entire team of 1st and 2nd year players minus Al Horford and Kenrich Williams.. he's doing great but lets pump the brakes here a bit...   Outside of those two the oldest guy on that team has played a total of 34 NBA games, basically college players"
"The coaching being good or SGA and Dort being good doesn't get to me. I just get mad about guys like Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams being good for literally no reason. It's like WTH guys, why are you such try hards. You know they aren't part of our future, and they have like no trade value, yet they're just killing us in the lottery by making the bench decent.  Ah well. Congrats on the Hami trade. I think you will be pleased. He's a great energy guy off the bench."
"Very random, but that Kenrich Williams steal and dunk in the final seconds looked really nice visually for some reason"
Kenrich Williams
"Idk man theo has been really good for us so far despite being drafted in the 2nd round and poku...well poku was seen as a project player anyway so he might take a while. Some of the new young guys on the team too are pretty good and have potential like moses brown, roby, and kenrich williams so personally I‚Äôm not too worried when it comes to scouting talent."
Lolol yeah. Kenrich Williams is Kenny Hustle.
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."
"I know Kenny Hustle has already been agreed upon, but Kenrich Williams ‚Äî&gt; Hairnet Williams"
"You mean a bearded 6th man SG?  Kenrich Williams is who you're looking for. As our friend and trade partner for the longest time, Rockets can have him for a low price of 2 FRPs"

"It‚Äôs even worse considering they gave up a first, and Hill and Kenrich Williams who are two versatile plus defenders with trade value around the league (we got two seconds for Hill and there were reports we had offers on Williams)."

Kenrich Williams must be stopped!!
There is no reason to play guys that are injured when you arent playing for anything. Im sure if they were on contention ty and dort would be playing but they have niggles and we arent so they arent.   As for the other guys perhaps theyve just seen enough of them to know what they have for next year. Who knows. But if you think Kenrich Williams is the difference between winning and losing you're reaching soemthing wicked.

"Kenrich Williams is the player of the game, huh?"
Kenrich Williams with a mullet?  Bold
"To maybe find a middle ground, I liked the Adams trade, but I didn't like the extension. When Favors left, we were left with absolutely no startable big men. Christian Wood had been released the year prior and gone to Detroit, and showed real promise there. Jahlil Okafor would have 24 good seconds in a game before his athleticism just made him a liability. He had some good games, but they were few and far between. Finally, Hayes was too young and inexperienced, he wasn't even supposed to play NBA minutes in his rookie year when the Pelicans drafted him.  All this to say that they needed a big man, and unless they wanted to pay for someone like Aaron Baynes, dumping those picks and guys they weren't resigning or had previously planned to release like Frank Jackson and Kenrich Williams seems like a fair tradeoff to me. But like you've said, the extension was not good when compared to market value, and the fact that you can find a low cost center in free agency in the off-season, or a better trade candidate.  Some people argue that he was also an extension target because of his attitude he brings to the team. I think that's pretty crappy speculation, we have no reason to believe that's anything more than wishful thinking for a fanbase."
While we‚Äôre on the subject can we talk about Kenrich Williams Afro mullet
"He‚Äôs at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He‚Äôs at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He‚Äôs at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn‚Äôt worth anything close to what he‚Äôs making. He‚Äôs turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don‚Äôt make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."
"Kenrich Williams, all he does is hustle"
"Kenrich Williams went to the barber and said ""Yes please give me the stupidest looking shit you can think of"""
"Except Kenrich Williams and Jaylen Hoards don't put butts in seats. Kawhi, Giannis, LeBron, etc. do. No disrespect to the Thunder's young guys, they have a lot of promise but they don't particularly lose a lot of revenue. The margins of Kawhi resting vs. playing in Toronto (and other stars in other markets, obviously he isn't an outlier) is going to be significantly greater than a g-league player's entire season. It's definitely not fair that San Antonio and Toronto got fined and OKC hasn't at all, but they bring much more revenue since they're bigger markets."
"Heir is a difference between developing young players to be better and putting them in a position to fail so that your pick is maximized.  Moses Brown has proven to be an awesome player  and unless he got hurt in the Pacers game, there was no reason for him to only play 18 minutes.  It‚Äôs already a blow out so have him run for 30.  The extra twelve ain‚Äôt hurting him.  Dort has improved tremendously yet he got a dnp for an injury that no one is aware of.  Nobody thinks Kenrich Williams is a great difference maker yet he‚Äôs clearly the best wing available and yet he doesn‚Äôt get over thirty minutes.  That‚Äôs hella sketchy.  Same with Ty Jerome.  He‚Äôs the best guard you have with SGA out.  He‚Äôs nothing special but isn‚Äôt it a slap in the face of a player like him trying to make it in the league and get paid to give him a coaches DNP because he‚Äôs slightly better than who you have on the court.  Detroit resting dudes is silly but they at least throw out all of their young guys for extended minutes even the good ones like Isiah Stewart who might screw up the tank.  Houston is giving Kevin Porter and Christian Wood all they can eat while they are healthy and if they lose they lose but at least they want to see what two cornerstones can do when healthy so they know who can be put around them.  We have no choice but to play our vets because we are so injured we just gotta play whoever is healthy to field an actually team.  We don‚Äôt have DNP luxuries.  I‚Äôd wish OkC fans can see why certain other fans find their non transparent tanking methods to be awful for the league."

"They didn't want to pay Harden in hindsight one of the biggest mistakes in NBA trade history. That aside the Front Office have made great moves. If Beverley hadn't injured Westbrook there more than likely could have had a championship. They got burned by KD and learnt from it, trading PG, Westbrook, CP3 for great returns as well as the role players Adams and Grant. Those players that you name have passed through at different stages, I think the way the Thunder handled the transition from Westbrook in particular who was a cornerstone of the franchise was really well done. Both sides were in agreement, Westbrook was keen to re-unite with Harden and the Thunder were eyeing up a rebuild. When Shai was traded for PG we had a new face for the franchise. I think the fan base is excited for our young guys with an eye to the draft. We have got Dort if course and now the euro sensations Poku and his fanny pack and Maledon. Throw in some good energy bench guys like Kenrich Williams, Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby and the future is looking bright."
Kenrich williams
The fuck is up with Kenrich Williams‚Äô hair
"https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/basketball/nba/player-news/headlines/10105976  &gt;Lu Dort (The Al Horford Special, right hip, tank commander, Cade Cunningham) will not play on Monday vs. Philly.   &gt;Of course he won't. Dort has had a remarkable season and that's why the Thunder continue to hold him out of back-to-backs as they try to make up ground with fellow tankers Houston, Detroit, Minnesota and Orlando. This draft class is loaded with talent if you're wondering why tanking has gotten out of hand this season. Look for Svi Mykhailiuk, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams to soak up extra minutes. Dort will probably see time in three of OKC's five games this week."
Their refusal to start Kenrich Williams is blatant and shameful tanking
Isn't it time we start seriously considering Kenrich Williams for MVP?

"Kenrich Williams has been a beast on defense, but it was so funny seeing him in slow-mo trying to get past that perfectly executed double screen."
"Kenrich Williams, dude is really blossoming in OKC."
Armoni Brooks and Kenrich Williams
"Last offseason NOP S&amp;T'd Kenrich Williams, Zylan Cheatham, and Josh Gray in the Steven Adams OKC trade."
"at least they‚Äôre already good players, people on the thunder sub get mad at the idea of trading fucking kenrich williams"
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
"There‚Äôs nobody as good as Holiday, or Rondo, or Mirotic, or Randle. Hell I‚Äôd rather have Kenrich Williams over whoever the Lakers‚Äô 3rd best player. ‚ÄúKenny Hustle‚Äù is literally the guy‚Äôs nickname."
"Like fam, they didn't even wait to see how he fit lol. That's so wild to me.  Also they gave up Hill, a 1st round pick and Kenrich Williams who has been pretty decent for us this year.  I thought it was mind boggling at the time. I'm not sure who else was going to give us a pick for adams at $28 million. I feel like you could see the spacing issues from a mile away.  Anyway, sorry to just be a downer. Not trying to be rude or anything. At least you have Zion. He's better than anything we have."
"I think the biggest thing with the Sixers is that they handed over the reins to a bunch of guys to play huge minutes and lead their offense, who were not only unqualified to do so, but what‚Äôs worse is that they had no intentions of having those guys as future pieces of the franchise. Look at the dozens of guys who littered through the Process Sixers.  But this year I think the Thunder did well to give a lot of opportunities to guys they actually envision as part of their future. Or at a minimum they found out of guys deserve more time. Guys like Maleson, Bazley, etc. earned/were gifted huge minutes this year because of OKC‚Äôs situation. I think both of those guys will be on the team in 2-3 years.   ***  In contrast you have the **2013-14 Sixers** - their top 5 minutes leaders were:    - Thad Young (not with PHI following year)   - MCW (in season trade following year)   - James Anderson (not with PHI following year)   - Evan Turner (traded mid season that year)   - Tony Wroten (played 38 more games for PHI after 2014 season)  **2014-15 Sixers**  Top 5 minutes leaders    - Nerlens (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15)   - RoCo (finally someone they developed and held onto long term)    - Mbah a Moute (gone at end of season - why did they play a 28 year old vet 29 mpg to score &lt; 10 PPG on &lt; 40% FG)   - Hollis Thompson (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15, but this is exactly the type of young player they should‚Äôve been playing, not known value vets like Luc)   - Henry Sims (gone at end of season)  **2015-16 Sixers**  Top 5 Minutes leaders    - Hollis Thompson (lead team in minutes, but then only played 31 games for them the next year)   - Jerami Grant (played 2 games for PHI following year)   - Isaiah Canaan (didn‚Äôt play with PHI following season - but even though he wasn‚Äôt in their future plans they had no problem letting him score 11 PPG on 36% FG)   - Nerlens    - RoCo  ***  Obviously, you never know what‚Äôs gonna happen, but this year the following were the top 5 minute-getters for OKC:   - Maledon (OKC acquired him in Horford deal and promptly signed him to a 3 year deal with a 4th year team option - ie they invested in his future)   - Bazley (used first round pick on him)   - Dort (signed through 2022-23 with OKC)   - Kenrich Williams (acquired via S&amp;T, signed through 2022-23)   - Isaiah Roby  With SGA and Poku rounding out the top 7.  Did sitting Horford make them less competitive? Of course. But let‚Äôs say, even if they didn‚Äôt have their own draft pick, sitting Horford still would‚Äôve been the correct decision because realistically he is not a part of their future."
"The Thunder's goal for this season was to tank while developing our young talent as much as possible.  SGA made a significant leap, Dort showed signs of improvement on offense while maintaining his defense.  We found guys like Kenrich Williams and Ty Jerome who could stay in OKC for the long haul as good role players.  Coach Daigneault was very impressive getting as many wins from this team as he did.  I'm excited to see how he does when the organization actually wants to win.  For most of the season it seemed our hopes of getting a top-5 pick in the draft were going to be dashed.  But after SGA's injury the team bottomed out to a historic degree.  Although the ""win"" against the Clippers last night was a blow, the Thunder are currently positioned to get at least one coveted top-5 pick, with an outside shot at a second.  So overall I'd say the tank was a success.  I'd give this season a B+.  Things didn't go perfectly, but I think the Thunder accomplished most of what they wanted to.  Now we just have to hope the lottery goes our way and doesn't cause our tanking to have been in vain."
"34 can‚Äôt even field a full team. It‚Äôs Giannis, JaVale McGee, Wendell Carter and Kenrich Williams. Which is an interesting four-man lineup, I guess."
Kenrich Williams aka Kenny hustle would be nice on the Warriors. I‚Äôd be cool with the thunder trading him and 18 for the 14.
"Trading back from 4 was more than just what you‚Äôre implying. It was about getting off Solomon Hill‚Äôs expiring contract too.          And as for Adams, it was mostly consolation of fringe assets besides Kenrich Williams.  A lottery protected Denver 1st, George Hill, Darius Miller, a WAS 2023 2nd and a CHA 2024 2nd. None of those fringe assets are moving the needle. At best you could say they should have traded Bledsoe instead of Hill. Which admittedly is a big whiff but nobody knew Bledsoe would be so bad.       You also need to pay more attention to Hayes and NAW."
"I doubt any of the top 4 will budge so I think the most likely move will be to take those picks after #6 (16, 18, 34, 36 &amp; 55) plus some of the more trade-baity guys on the roster (Kenrich Williams, Gabriel Deck) to try and get up as high into the late lottery as possible.  I could see them going after the New Orleans #10 using some of those picks and offering to eat up Bledsoe and/or Adams' contracts. If it takes both 16+18 to get back in the top 10 then they could take those 3 2nd rounders and watch how the board falls and try to trade up for a guy they really like somewhere in the 20s like Thor, Murphy or Prkacin."
"Yeah I picked Bey up off the waiver wire. It was awesome. I had so many good waiver wire plays. Being in a deep league is way more fun because you have to watch the 12th man on the bench and injuries more.  Bey, Diallo, Kaminsky had a good run for me, Cam Payne, Bismack had a few decent games, Moses Brown, Kenrich Williams, Saben Lee"
Kenny Hustle is Kenrich Williams
I‚Äôd throw in 16 this year and maybe one of our more mediocre future first and or someone like Kenrich Williams. His contract might look awful in a couple years but it would be worth it for his upside.
The fact he even thought it was a good idea to trade for Adams in the first place was bad enough but then he traded George Hill and a young prospect like Kenrich Williams along with a pick for him when he coulda just traded away Bledsoe with a pick and then we wouldn‚Äôt be looking at tryna get rid of both Bledsoe and Adams which will likely take even more picks to do. We damn near gonna end up with nothing for Jrue Lmao
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players‚Äô number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"It was Kenrich Williams, George Hill, Darius Miller on his bad Achilles, the Indiana first in the previous draft and two future seconds. The only piece guaranteed to be worth anything to the Pelicans was Williams."
"I'd rather be the third team. Ben is perfect in Minny but either way, we don't have that win now package Morey is looking for unless they view DLo as an All-Star still (I mean, he did make it once) while OKC sends out players like Bazley/ Roby, Svi/ Deck, Ty Jerome, and Kenrich Williams, for depth"
"Ty Jerome, Kenrich Williams, and three of the middling FRPs.  But after reports Ben really wants the glamorous life, realistically nothing."
&gt;  Kenrich Williams  lets do it
"I think out of our roster the tradeable guys that teams would actually want are probably Bazley, Maledon, Ty Jerome, Kenrich Williams and maybe Isaiah Roby  Would be fine with any of those for Lauri tbh"
yo if I were Chicago I'd want Kenrich Williams
"The Thunder can fix some of those issues. Kemba Walker, Isaiah Roby, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams and the Houston picks for Simmons. Jerome shot 43% on 5.3 3PA last season, some of those were pretty deep and he's a legit backup point guard. Kenny Hustle is a do it all forward who also shot above 40% from outside last season, he also has a wet mid-ranger. Roby is another decent 4/smallball 5 who can score inside and pass the ball. Isaiah's not perfect but dude is tough. With those three players, Philly fills out their bench with decent, productive contributors on cheap contracts. Kemba is another effective outside shooter who can provide perimeter creation. It is breaking a dollar into quarters but Philly get better as a team with this move."
"Thunder could easily fulfill the pick request, but would the Sixers be cool with getting Kemba. We could throw in Kenrich Williams or maybe Ty Jerome.  Simmons then plays small ball center for us and we are full of long playmakers."
"True, I expect them to move Hield for another big or a stretch four once Holmes is resigned. They‚Äôre not going to get anything of value for Bagley anyway, another trade I was thinking for Bagley would be to the Thunder for Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams. Both cheap rotational pieces."
But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. What about kenrich Williams
"Kenrich Williams, Mike Muscala, and 2nd round pick for 17"
"You can‚Ä¶https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1418340159318224902?s=21  ‚Äúteams CAN S&amp;T more than one player together to aggregate salary. Example: New Orleans sent Zylan Cheatham (S&amp;T, Josh Gray (S&amp;T), Kenrich Williams (S&amp;T), Darius Miller (under contract at the time) to OKC for Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe‚Äù"
"It was George Hill, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, the top-10 protected Denver first, the Washington 2023 2nd, and the CHA 2024 2nd. I don't know where you're getting the other seconds from."
"Those are pro players he's playing against which is even crazier. Aaron Holiday, Svi Mykhailiuk, Kenrich Williams, Mike James, Lonnie Walker, Rajon Rondo, and Quincy Pondexter."
"We didn't trade for Bledsoe. Bledsoe was needed to make the salaries work. And as for Adams, tell me how Kenrich Williams + Darius Miller + George Hill + Lottery Protected Denver 1st 2023-25 + WAS 2023 2nd + CHA 2024 2nd beats Adams at 17 M? Particularly when Jokic and AD are still playing in the West?"
"I think Kenrich Williams is a playable guy that the Thunder could offer if they needed to. Kenrich shot better from 3, had a higher FG%, and is a better defender in my opinion. It also doesn‚Äôt help that Grayson Allen is a RFA after the season so he can only be a bargain for at most a year, Kenrich isn‚Äôt a FA until 2 seasons from now."
"Jrue was not sign and traded. Kenrich Williams, Zylan Cheatham, and Josh Gray were part of the same trade and all sign and traded"
"&gt;I thought the Jrue trade was great.   It would have been if it had just been that straight up, but he made it instantly worse by folding in the Steven Adams deal along with it (especially since he was already taking back a negative contract in Bledsoe).   Here is what the actual trade wound up being from the Pels side:  * **Out:** Jrue Holiday, Sam Merrill, Zylan Cheatham, Joshia Gray, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, a 2023 2nd round draft pick and a 2024 2nd round draft pick   * **In:** Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 1st round picks, and swap rights on Milwaukee's 2024 &amp; 2026 1sts, which most likely won't be used (and now New Orleans has had to send out one of the picks they got from the Lakers in the AD trade just to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe)  So basically they traded Jrue, two 2nds and a bunch of random players and got back two late 1st round picks and two negative value contracts they had to attach a pick to to unload. That's not very good in the aggregate."
"Starting should be:  Giddey (if healthy)  SGA  Dort  Bazley  Favors  Bench: Theo Maledon, Kenrich Williams, Isaiah Roby, Mike Moose Muscala, Poku (probably be starting by season's end)"
"When AD demanded the trade and it seemed like it was going to happen before the deadline, it was tough to watch the Pelicans. I decided I was just going to wait until the trade was made and then start watching again. Then the trade deadline passed and AD was still on the team. Those games were tough to watch. We were starting like 3 guys who aren't in the league anymore at some points. I was able to go to a game toward the end of the season against the Rockets, and AD looked very good for his NBA-forced 21 minutes. Then Christian Wood put up like 30-10. The Pelicans lost by 30. And the highlight of the game was when the stands gave Kenrich Williams a standing ovation for stealing the ball from James Harden at halfcourt.  The team has been pretty fun to watch since then fortunately. Although the next season, Zion and Derrick Favors got hurt and the Pels went on like a 16 game losing streak which was pretty dark too. That season got better though."
"I dislike seeing Kenrich Williams, not because I dislike him as a player or person, I just hate his weird mullet-thing."
I have a lot of hair complaints:  Colin Sexton‚Äôs rat tail  Kenrich Williams‚Äô shag  Xavier Tillman‚Äôs struggle fro  KD‚Äôs lack of brushing
Kenrich Williams has the worst haircut I have ever personally witnessed
It was literally random lmao. Kenrich Williams got more minutes than Giddey.
"Except 1.) vets aren‚Äôt our best players, and 2.) I have zero problem with vets, just play them consistently.   Muscala should not get sporadic minutes in the middle of the third quarter. That‚Äôs not rotations.  Our first round #6 pick played 20 minutes. Less than Kenrich Williams."
I like how Rudy‚Äôs so good you get an r/nba highlight just for scoring against him.  Now somebody post Kenrich Williams trying to ISO Gobert because that shit was hilarious.
"Y'all were a Curry and Draymond injury (or perhaps benching to keep them healthy) away from trotting out a Thunder-level lineup. It was ridiculous. And even the Thunder had to sit SGA, Dort, Horford, Kenrich Williams, and Muscala to achieve such results."
"2nd attempt.  I fired up the trade machine and tried to find a third team that could get involved.  three way between Lakers, OKC, Kings  * Lakers give Russ, 2025 swap, 2026 1st, 2027 swap, 2023 2nd (Chi), 2023 2nd * Lakers get Buddy Hield, Derrick Favors, Kenrich Williams  Why Lakers would do this - they dump Russ's contract, get a shooter in Hield, a wing in Williams, and an extra big body in Favors  * OKC gives Derrick Favors,, Kenrich Williams * OKC gets Russ, 2025 swap, 2026 1st  Why OKC would do this - they're going to be too good to tank, Russ can help them on the court, he brings culture, and they get picks out of it.  * Kings give Hield * Kings get 2027 swap, 2023 2nd (Chi), 2023 2nd  Why Kings would do this - they get out of Hield's contract and get a swap and 2nd out of it."
Jrue requested a trade. So that's why Griffin traded him. Griffin's plan is to spend Zion's rookie contract accumulating assets and maintaining salary flexibility. Adams was signed a discount compared to what he was making in OKC and they gave up fringe assets (and Kenrich Williams) to get him and his clearly defined role.      The Bensons have always given their executives a long leash so unless Zion takes his qualifying offer and then leaves for nothing Griffin's not getting fired any time soon.
The disrespect to Kenrich Williams
"There's one. Kenrich Williams could be argued as another. After that it gets sketchy and fast. Muscala can eat up some minutes, after that it's just a bunch of completely unproven guys that have been objectively bad up to this point. He's right."
"damn, I made a comment in the offseason that had Kenrich Williams going to the Lakers for picks.  Great minds really do think alike."
we need to trade for kenrich williams
"He has the potential to be an top tier role player. Capable scorer and defender, always making the right plays, hustles like crazy. Basically a better shooting version of Kenrich Williams."
Kenrich Williams and perhaps a side of Ty Jerome
Westbrook - Brodie  Mike Muscala - Moose  Steven Adams - Funaki  Josh Giddey - The Wizard of Aus  Dort - Dort Knox  Kenrich Williams - Kenny Hustle  Gabriel Deck - Tortuga  Kevin Durant - Snek  Andre Roberson - Robes  Alex Abrines - Senor  Deonte Burton - Blockhead  Raymont Felton - Uncle Ray  Nick Collison - Mr. Thunder  Kyle Singler - The GOAT  Semaj Christon - Backwards James
Every time I see Kenrich Williams hair my eyes bleed
The look on Durant's face after Kenrich Williams barreled into him was pricelessüòÇ
"Lonzo on that contract was not good. 20 M for a perpetually ice-cold Kyle Korver with elite transition passing to be your 3rd option is not good value for the Pelicans. Unless you're talking about using it for trade fodder as salary.       The only true mistake in terms of asset was not sending Bledsoe to OKC for Adams, who was actually a buy-low candidate in terms of trade assets. I know everybody likes to parrot that they gave up a first, but it was a lottery-protected Denver 1st from 23-25. Darius Miller hasn't played in the league since his Achilles example.         And not sending them Bledsoe cost them the Lakers pick this year (top-10 protected). Every other mistake can be quibbled with at best. Sending different earlier seconds for Adams, keeping Kenrich Williams from OKC, getting the Lakers pick to have lottery protections, etc.  You do the trade down in both rounds to exchange Adams for JV 100/100 times."
"They can bench Shai and bench/trade Muscala, Favors, Jerome and Kenrich Williams (those are the guys who are low key decent NBA players).  Without Shai it would mean more usage for players who simply aren't ready for it"
"I think Pop could clamp Kenrich ""6 pts on 48%TS"" Williams tbh"
Who is Kenrich Williams and why is his hair the greatest?
"Lol Russ objectively lost the game for the Lakers. Gambled for a steal that led to a wide open Kenrich Williams three. Literally left Dort wide open for no reason to just watch another Thunder player. Then a fastbreak turnover that could‚Äôve been avoided by not running 100mph into the paint.   Lastly, took a hash mark three to try to tie the game after Melo hit back to back threes to keep them in the game. Russ has played a lot better the last few games but he absolutely shat the bed in impressive fashion to end the game."
"Ah yes, SGA, Lu Dort, and *checks notes* Kenrich Williams will lead OKC to the promised land"
#IMAGINE LOSING TO KENRICH WILLIAMS AND TY JEROME
kenrich williams got a bit of a khabib vibe with that beard
I hate Kenrich Williams' mullet to an irrational degree.
We'll trade you 3 FRPs for Jaylen and a lightly used Kenrich Williams.
"Yeah, people are making tank jokes, but we actually wanted to win tonight. You can tell by the way we played Muscala and Kenrich Williams a lot tonight with SGA/Giddey; even though their stats don't look great, they're the veteran leaders of the team and play the smartest basketball. They're the players we play when we want to win.  Unfortunately, Dort was out and Darius ""I'ma go 1v2 with PG and Reggie Jackson with one minute left on the clock"" Bazley was out there with those four instead.  This wasn't a tank loss. This was a ""young team falls apart in the fourth quarter and also why is Darius Bazley taking the ball away from SGA and Giddey"" loss."
