Dennis Schroder has played elite defense all year man. His ball pressure and quickness has been one of the reasons the Lakers are number 1 in defense.
"LeBrons release is so much faster on the threes now  i don't think they will.. but i wouldn't be shocked if the lakers cost themselves a title with this Schroder as a starter stuff..   because it's still a lot of Bron/AD no matter what.. and that diminishes what Dennis can do cause he has the ball less, and him standing in the corner and on defense he's been good but still 6ft only.. i just don't think value wise it's the best way to use him.. if he's on fire yeah sure he should close some games   but if he was on the bench just playing with one of them really and could score more that'd be better for them..  i think they should start one of like Talen, Caruso, Wes instead really"
Pleasant: Kuzma (rebounding and 3 pt shooting)   Unpleasant: Dennis Schroder (Ball hog and taking away shots from AD)
Yes it has. Empty stats are when you're putting up points but doing it as an inefficient black hole and/or giving those points back on defense. Basically someone like Dennis Schroder
Need another shot creator that isn't LeBron. Or for Schroder to pick up his play/start being used correctly. THT and Caruso are serviceable ball handlers but Dennis needs to be more of a threat to shoot or pass off the dribble.
I thought he was drunk on love for Dennis Schroder tbh
What Dennis Schroder did after Embiid fell was what I expected LeBron to do in that situation.  It doesn't take alot to just show some concern after a fall.
"The Lakers got away with hiding, 6'1 Dennis Schroder on 6'10 Ben Simmons in the 4th. Fucking pathetic."

"This sounds a lot better, but Mega Schroder is way more funny and also more accurate, as Capela is really just a much bigger Dennis, not a Super version of him"
"Lowry- 2yrs 50.  I think he’s just too good still and will get a better version of what dragic got.  Decent chance he just resigns whether it’s with Toronto or team he’s traded too because most of the teams with cap space aren’t contenders  Drummond- like 15 mil, he’s having a good year.  Maybe like 3yrs 45.  Collins- a max.  He won’t make all-nba so no rose rule and only getting 25% and can only get 4yrs.  That’s around 4yrs 120 and he’ll get that since he fits the timeline of a young team with cap space.  Hawks i think match that though they don’t love it, rather give like 4yrs 100.  Schroder- lakers fans won’t like it but he might just get the 4yrs 80 extension.  Last year does seem like an outlier but unlike atl Dennis, he’s a pretty good defender now.  Even with reduced stats, he’ll have lot of suitors in free agency.  Thj- I’m not sure since idk what Dallas does in free agency.  Maybe a clarkson type money over 2-3 years.   Caruso- Connaughton type deal.  Maybe gets mle  Dipo- still has injury worries and isn’t playing as well as people think so what Hayward was getting offered before Charlotte overpaid"
"We'd be better if Schroder was coming off the bench, AC has definitely improved enough as a ballhandler since last season that he can bring the ball up against a full court press &amp; he plays better off LBJ &amp; presumably Gasol (we dont see them much together). Minor issue tho &amp; AC doesn't really care about starting, while it seems Dennis does. Dennis has been great too, so Idc."

"&gt;The trade would include a package consisting of guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder, forward Kyle Kuzma, and a first-round selection each from the 2022 and 2027 drafts.  So in this hypothetical, the Lakers roster would turn into:  James/Beal/Matthews/Davis/Gasol  Caruso/THT/Dudley/Morris/Harrell  With just Cook left as a reserve point guard, that guard depth is looking pretty thin."

"I totally get you, I always struggle to understand new sports I’m trying to get in to until I grasp player’s relative skill. Dennis Schroder has been about as good as the average nba starting PG, but he’s declined a little recently. So since there’s 30 teams, you can think of Schroder as around the ~20th best PG in the NBA.   If you’re a nerd like me, a useful tool is basketball-reference.com. Look up any player, scroll down to “advanced” and look at their PER (player efficiency rating) and BPM (box plus-minus). The average PER is 15, 20-25 is all star, 30 is MVP-caliber. BPM is an estimate of how many points a player adds to his team per 100 possessions. Those are very useful stats for figuring out who’s good and who’s not."
There isn't a more mischievous looking person alive than Dennis Schroder. Dude looks like he was born to piss off and undermine elementary school teachers and pretty much any sort of authority figure.
Dennis Schroder is completely dicing the Warriors up. Anthony Davis has thrown a few good passes as well. Golden State looks totally outclassed here.
They really gave LeBron prime Dennis Schroder

Dennis Schroder man! What a great defender at the point guard position. Lock down.
I'm sorry but this sub is filled with delusional Lebron and Laker fans. If you actually think Dennis Schroder and Harrell are comparable to having Kyrie Irving as your 3rd option you're not very smart. The Lakers are screwed
"I forget why, but he was mad at Dennis Schroder lol"
"Yep. The Lakers already offered him the most they were allowed to, [but on Feb. 16th they'll be able to offer a lot more:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30596881/sources-los-angeles-lakers-begin-contract-extension-talks-dennis-schroder)  &gt; Before the start of the season, Schroder turned down an initial Lakers offer to extend his contract for an additional two years and $33.4 million, sources said -- an overture that represented the maximum allowable offer the Lakers could make to him prior to Feb. 16. &gt;  &gt; Schroder, who entered the final year of a $15.5 million contract, becomes eligible to extend that deal for more money and more years -- as much as $83 million over four years -- between Feb. 16 through the start of the 2021 offseason.  If he doesn't get extended before the 2021 offseason then he'll become an unrestricted free agent, but the Lakers will have his full Bird rights and at that point could offer him anything up to a full 5 year max contract starting at 30% of the cap."
I'm geeking out at the idea of Dennis Schroder trash talking his own teammates. What is that lol
Dennis Schroder is now 6'3''? WTH lol he looked shorter than Chris Paul at OKC.
"I'm guessing Dennis Schroder was never ""it"" when playing tag growing up."
"So many trolls out today..  Thunder were projected low bc people thought they'd tank and sell high on vets like Danilo Gallinari/Dennis Schroder.  The roster itself was passable, but their success depended on SGA developing and CP3 staying healthy.  Both of those things happened.  The Rockets lost to the Lakers in the EXACT same fashion as the Blazers- won game one, then got 4-1'd.  The Rockets lost in increasing amounts every game, too.  Dame got injured and didn't even play the end of the series.  We wouldn't have won anyways, but to call Dame overrated for playing 3.5 games of playoff basketball against the eventual championship is ridiculous.   Also, the Suns were 5-2 over their first 7 games last season, tied for 2nd with the Clippers and behind the 5-1 Lakers.  Stop crowning them any seed yet."
"Lol, I just wanna say Dennis Schroder is amazing. His standalone offense is great but I've been super impressed with his defensive intensity."
"&gt; Guys that can bully Dennis by size, Danny can probably stop.  You're looking at it wrong if you think just because they were traded for each other that Schroder is Green's replacement. They effectively swapped out Green and Rondo for Matthews and Schroder.   In the playoffs Rondo was out there much more than Green was, so this idea that bigger guys couldn't bully Green in the way they can Schroder is a false equivalency. The question is can they bull Schroder any more than they bullied Rondo? Because Rondo is the same size as Schroder and he was out there a lot. I think Schroder is every bit as good defensively as Rondo currently is, he might even be better.  So if Schroder is out there then the other player out there in the backcourt with him will either be KCP, Caruso or Matthews, and those guys aren't any more susceptible to getting bullied than Danny Green is. As for losing Rondo's BBIQ, they replaced that with Marc Gasol, who's right up there among the league's smartest players. So I think the Lakers *did* lose valuable pieces this offseason, but they've replaced them with even better ones."
He was this good last year in OKC and people crapped on him a lot. Dennis just grew a ton from year 1 to year 2 for the Thunder. Chris was huge in getting Schroder to control his pace better and make better decisions
"Dennis Schroder was such a huge pickup, some great defensive plays and clutch 3s in the 4th from him and AD"

9 players on the court are playing with preseason energy and then there’s Dennis schroder picking up Chris Paul 90 feet from the basket every play
"AD has missed a third of the season and when he was in he was putting up the same numbers that Murray is putting up now, although with better defense to be fair.  The Lakers 3rd best player is Dennis Schroder who doesn't even average 15 ppg and is less efficient than MPJ.   The other Lakers starters' PER is nothing to write home about either. KCP is at 9.8, Gasol is at 11.2, Kuz is 12.8 and Morris isn't even top 190 in the stat.   This idea that Jokic has a bad supporting cast is pretty hilarious tbh. I said it yesterday but if anyone has it bad it's Dame. Dude is missing 3 starters and is still tied for the same record as the Nuggets. He must be the MVP then correct?"

The Lakers are 5-5 without AD and of those 10 games Dennis Schroder has missed 3.
could use a guy like Dennis Schroder
The problem is that Schroder is out. The last two games with Dennis are an W for the Lakers
"No AD or dennis schroder. Their 3 point shooting has been problematic as of late, though and it has been even MORE problematic with AD and Dennis missing. If the team has to have this losing streak  now and have AD and dennis healthy for the playoffs, id gladly take it. But this is such an overreaction."
"LeBron is too old lmao. That just confirms you don’t know shit. Not to mention Schroder and Harrell are the 3rd and 4th leading scorers, play significant minutes and have played in every game except for Dennis last night. Lakers have the 2nd best record in the league with that core and their new signings.   Meanwhile the Nets are one of the worst defensive teams *ever* and rely on the opposition to miss shots in order to win. The only team to ever win a championship with a bad defense was the Lakers and they turned it on in the playoffs to go 15-1 to win yet another title. You better pray the Wizards don’t make the playoffs because you could be out in the first round lol"

A team lead by Dennis Schroder is blowing out the Kings.
"I feel like you are over simplifying something that is super complicated.    Better to not try to compare individual players.  The obvious place to start is AD+Bron versus Jokic+Murray, start with the stars.  Edge Lakers there for sure, but not by much, especially with the Lakers being banged up.  But when you start adding the rest of the pieces I think it swings Nuggets, MPJ+Gordon+Barton versus KCP+Dennis+Andre is very very Nuggets favored.    Is the gap between AD+Bron (assuming 100%) and Jokic+Murray bigger than the gap between MPJ+Gordon+Barton over KCP+Schroder+Drummond?  Pretty hard argument to make, imo.  And again, that is assuming the Lakers get back to 100%.    That is just straight up starters of course.  From what we have seen from the two teams benches the total package has to skew Lakers, the Nuggets second unit has been a gaping wound all year long(one that we hope will be sutured by JaVale and getting Morris back)."

Dennis Schroder seems like he is keen on making every game his showcase  We’re fucked
FUCK DENNIS SCHRODER
Every missed three is a million bucks off the top of 84 mil for Dennis Schroder
That Dennis Schroder should let lebron james be the point guard because that's how we won championship.  Yeah and also how about passing the ball to AD more lol
my man said Dennis Schroder
"18 first rounders is a ton, and I think you have to take into account just how random drafting can be. One thing I did that I found quite interesting is just pick any 7 year stretch and use a random number generator to randomly pick a list of 18 first rounders. Almost every time, you end up with a great, multiple time all-star, player.   I did it once from the 2005-2011 draft and got a team with DeMarre Carroll, Joakim Noah, Jrue Holiday and Steph Curryand then did it again with 2012-2018 draft and got Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter Jr, Jonathan Isaac, Jamal Murray, Clint Capela, and Dennis Schroder.   18 first rounders doesn’t mean that you automatically win a championship, but it definitely means you get a top 10-15 player. You have to get really unlucky to not stumble into at least one elite player."
Would you rather pay 100 mil to devonte or Dennis Schroder
"Schroder has been fine.  He looks worse without LeBron and AD, but I don't think anyone in their right mind ever thought Dennis was a first or second option.  He's been really good in my opinion, especially on defense. And having another ball handler that can score in non-LeBron minutes is really important for this team. Hell, guys that can score or dribble at all are really important for this Lakers team, and Dennis does both of those at a good enough level."
" Angeles Lakers guard Dennis Schroder appears to be betting on receiving a lucrative contract offer as a free agent this offseason.

"All nba first team lebron James, all nba first team Anthony Davis, 6moty Montreal Harrell, 6moty runner up Dennis Schroder, close to all star Kyle kuzma. Also, lets not pretend that Drummond is some scrub, he was an all star 3 years ago and ""on layups"" is such a strawman."
"If you're sayin Dennis Schroder or Andre Drummond fulfill the definition of a super team, you're kind of scratching the bottom of the barrel. Those two have combined for one All Star, and that was a reserve pick when John Wall got injured."
"I disagree. Dennis Schroder, Gasol and Montrezl are not better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Lamarcus Aldridge. But if you add Andre drummond to the list, instead of Gasol. Then they’re probably equal."
Dennis Schroder and KCP. Best I can do. Ask for THT I'm hanging the phone up
"While that's a good point, Dennis has at least expressed interest in wanting to stay with the Lakers.  Lowry most likely wants to stay on the East coast near his family. It'd be a lot less likely having him stay than Schroder. Not to mention Lowry is 35 now, his production could fall steeply in the next 2 years."
"If wes and caruso were at least average then maybe. But they literally cannot score on their own to save their lives. Lowry is obviously better than dennis but  once again he ain't replacing the points production of 3 players. Basketball is won by points. I don't care how good lowry is he ain't scoring the same amount of 3 players, he's not that guy. Caruso and wes literally miss multiple open shots they aren't playing much better with lowry guaranteed. Schroder isnt ain't even that bad"
"Damn, I mean at least you know what you’d be getting into, but I just disagree.  Lowry would probably be like a 50/2 contract, Dennis wants like 100/4  I’d much rather pay Lowry that for 2 years than overpay Schroder to that degree for 4 years."
Dennis Schroder
"Literally Kyle Kuzma, Montrezz Harrell and Dennis Schroder are the best players outside of Lebron and AD..there’s better supporting casts on lottery teams. The Bulls supporting cast may be better than the Lakers and they have been a lottery team for years."
"&gt;This Lakers team is really starting to gel without AD  Some of ya living in a cave or somethin  &gt;  Lakers are literally the best defensive team in the league, and they also have a crazy high win percentage without AD.  As long as the other players are healthy and playing.. LeBron takes care of everything else  &gt;  Lakers only lost a few back to back before the All Star Break, when Dennis was also not playing.. and rest of the team just flopped horribly.     But especially without Schroder, LeBron doesn't have his reliable Secondary ball handler"
"If anything, Dennis Schroder should be MVP because that team falls apart when he's not there"
"Lebron has guys like Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, Dennis Schroder, Gasol, and even Matthews is decent   Green has Kelly Oubre, Andrew wiggins, Steph Curry, James Wiseman etc.   One team has much better defensive personnel than the other."
This Dennis Schroder guy is such a game losing player. So many stupid turnovers and poor drives. Bring back Rondo!
Dennis Schroder is underrated?

"&gt;I can tell that you have a poor understanding of basketball because you think that Marcus smart is going to command FVV money. FVV as a combo guard is a borderline all star.   Well we both agree that Boston won't spend that kind of money on Marcus Smart, but unfortunately you don't seem to be aware of what his market value actually is. FVV and Dennis Schroder are very good indicators of what the market is gonna be for Smart. The fact that Boston won't pay that much (just like with Hayward and Horford) is why he'll walk (just like they did), but Smart will get those kinds of offers.   I wonder if you'll think back on this in the future when all of this happens and will think to yourself ""wow, that guy was correct."" My guess is you won't, but instead will be like ""it was smart of the Celtics to not offer Fournier that kind of money!"" You know, just like you did with Horford and Hayward. And then you'll repeat the same process the following summer with Smart when he leaves for greener pastures. It's just what you guys do, no matter how many times the same situation plays out. You think you guys would learn, but apparently not."
"I have my doubts you're gonna get that many years of Tatum as it is. Boston is way over the cap and their ownership is extremely resistant to paying the tax. That means this summer when it comes time to re-sign Fournier and offer Smart an extension I think Boston will low-ball both. As a result I expect Fournier will sign elsewhere and Smart will become a free agent in 2022 and will probably leave as well, as his market value is probably gonna be in the $22-25m range (after all, if FVV and Dennis Schroder can get those offers, then Smart can too).   So once Fournier and Smart are gone the Celtics will be mired in mediocrity due to their large payroll and it'll just be a matter of time before both Tatum and Brown are asking to be traded to a more competitive situation and Boston will be rebuilding again. I think the odds that those guys win even one title in Boston is very slim nowadays."
"He mean the Dennis schroder, Cp3, shai, galinari, adams lineup"
The Lakers were also without some play maker named Dennis Schroder rumored to be their starting point guard.
"[\[The Athletic\] The Lakers were willing to trade away Dennis Schröder and KCP for Kyle Lowry. However, **the sticking point in the trade was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/mdbymq/the_athletic_the_lakers_were_willing_to_trade/)  Lowry, Caruso, Wes Matthews, and Mclemore&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Schroder, Caruso, KCP, Mclemore, THT, and Matthews"
"The headline is just saying the Knicks are targeting these players, not that they'll sign there. Besides, it's not like 35-year old Kyle Lowry or Dennis Schroder are exactly star players"
"Dennis Schroder is probably one of the fastest guys in the league. He probably is close to DK’s time. There are probably a few guys in the league who can run that fast because that’s like 70% of the game. That being said.  DK’s time wasn’t that impressive, mid 10’s is like where a lot of okay high school kids are at. I ran with a kid who at 15 yrs old ran a 10.38. My best was a 10.89 I could run a 40 in 4 flat on repeat like it was candy; 3.8 and 3.7 are kind of just what sprinters do."
On no Earth is Nic Batum a better player than Dennis Schroder.

"I found the article by typing ""Dennis Schroder Hawks locker room"" into Google.  I'm sure you could find similar articles that are accessible from your country by doing the same."
I don't know how reliable it is but here's an article that goes into it a little bit  https://www.ajc.com/blog/jeff-schultz/time-for-hawks-move-from-dennis-schroder/l18uRFYS7F7Y8bEDl17o3M/
How much money did getting COVID cost Dennis Schroder? Lmao
"&gt; I just don't really understand how you can say Lebron is a point guard, but Luka isn't...and vice versa   Lakers have dennis schroder as their PG and Mavs have don't have anyone historically considered a PG"
"2020 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 10 minutes per game. 2019 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 25 minutes per game. They did not have a 'better version' of Terrance Ferguson because he was never good. They just did not have anyone at all better than him to play. I'm sorry, but even if your starters consist of Paul George and Russell Westbrook, if your #7 guy is 25 mpg of Terrance Ferguson you are a terribly constructed roster. Period.  Steven Adams averaged 3 less points, Jerami Grant averaged 2 less points, Dennis Schroder averaged 2 less points, Terrance Ferguson averaged 2 less points, Markief Morris averaged 2 less points... all than their regular season averages. The Thunder lost 2 games by 5 points or less, despite getting 11 less PPG of production from their already atrocious bench outside of Schroder.  2020: Shai lost 3, CP3 gained 4, Schroder lost 1.5, Gallo lost 4, Adams lost 1, Dort gained 6, Bazley gained 1, for a net gain of .5 PPG.  So yeah, I'd say losing 11 PPG of production for the 2019 squad while the 2020 squad lost nothing is a pretty big deal. The 2020 squad was also a fair bit better defensively in 2020 than 2019, and defense means more in the playoffs. The 2019 squad's strength was scoring, and the rest of the squad went cold in the playoffs. Russ and PG13 showed up and did their jobs. The bench didn't.  Cp3's run was very impressive, but ultimately he had a deeper roster and better load distribution among the supporting cast."
"nah you lost multiple key pieces and replaced them with andre drummond and dennis schroder.  marc gasol is a good piece but he's not enough to replace dwight, danny and rondo  lebron is a year older with even more wear on his knees  you should honestly remove that flair because I feel embarrassed for all the reasonable and normal laker fans on your behalf, your comments are so cringey"
According to Dennis Schroder only himself and LeBron are not vaccinated on the team
"Not sure if that makes them a contender, but there was a rumor that the Knicks are interested in signing Dennis Schroder."
"No, that's you projecting. Dennis Schroder going to get blood clots and everyone confused as to what happened, meanwhile I'm facepalming at your ignorance."
"2-8 record, AD still limping, Lebron still with a sore ankle, and Dennis Schroder being out for 2 weeks with covid, and not enough time to ramp up? HA"
"The Lakers looked good with him on the court this year, and the stats bear it out. If you clicked the article you would have seen that:  &gt;&gt; The statistical case in Gasol's favor is overwhelming. He is the only center on the team with a positive plus-minus since Drummond arrived at plus-13. The Lakers have been outscored by six points with Drummond on the floor, and more distressingly, they've lost Montrezl Harrell's minutes by 61 points. Before Anthony Davis got hurt, the starting lineup featuring him, Gasol, LeBron James, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder destroyed teams by 13.9 points per 100 possessions. The sample is small, but so far, Drummond and Davis have played 133 minutes together and the Lakers have lost those minutes by 26 points. The two have struggled to find any chemistry on defense, and offensively, Drummond's presence as a non-shooter has clogged the paint for Davis.   &gt;&gt; Gasol's shooting makes it easier for teammates to get to the basket, and his passing is infectious. The Lakers have a 64 percent assist rate with him on the floor and a 59.1 percent assist rate when he's on the bench. He is by no means Drummond's equal as an athlete, but remains an effective defender, thanks to his high basketball IQ.   At the very least he is clearly better than Drummond, and Harrell in most cases as well."
Later in the Twitter thread it also states that Dennis Schroder doesn’t like taking pain killers as well. What’s the point of adding that other than cause some drama? Imo it’s normal to dislike taking pain killers for various reasons but I just found it funny he chose to add that fact randomly.
"A ton of my friends are non US citizens and got vaccinated. Illegal immigrants may not be eligible, but presumably Dennis Schroder has all his proper visas."
"How can people be so boneheaded?  Dennis Schroder is out for the next 10-14 days because of health and safety protocols. Can’t tell me it’s not COVID related. With the standings right now, Portland, Dallas, and Los Angeles are literally within a game or two of each other. Getting vaccinated would have removed the possibility of him quarantining and playing the last stretch into the offseason.   Of course, there are a multitude of other benefits to getting vaccinated, but this one has an immediate impact on his fucking career.  Guys, please get the shot. It’ll help us all. Do it for one of the 600,000 people that couldn’t.   Stay safe!"
Dennis Schroder in the playoffs last year ya dummy
For me KP would be good for the team but not at a max contract. He commends Dennis Schroder style money not a super max.
Dennis Schroder called him the greatest PG of all time. I'm sure that will convince you.
Why does he look like a bald Dennis Schroder in this thumbnail
"I do love Thunder Legend Dennis Schroder, Thunder Legend Markieff Morris, and OKC Blue Legend Alex Caruso, but - I gotta root for the Wiz on this one"
I mean Dennis Schroder plays for the Lakers and Jason Kidd is a Laker's coach.

"""Nets in for my ass"" Dennis Schroder 2k21"
"Damn, Lakers have been pretty confident/arrogant lately with:     'Nets in four, my ass'- Dennis Schroder  'No one wants to see us in the first round'- Anthony Davis  Guess that's what you'd expect from the defending champs, Lebron hasn't said much though."
Dennis Schroder was turning down 22m and Oubre is going to 20m and up zone.  I definitely think a younger Lonzo can possibly get more than them.

"That's how the financials of the NBA work though, if they let him walk there is no way to replace his value (other than if they happen to draft someone just as good).    That's why the Sixers are paying Tobias Harris, or the Lakers will probably have to overpay Dennis Schroder."
"He needs to go to Dennis Schroeder’s barber, [mf saved his life](https://www.google.com/search?q=dennis+schroder+hair+before+and+after.m&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#imgdii=rOWvxKNI9NxVtM&amp;imgrc=V_9NQ9BGkxNY6M)"
Here’s the lists I made:  KD had:  Russ  Prime Ibaka  Young Harden and Prime Harden  Curry  Klay  DPOY Draymond  Kyrie  Iguodala    Lebron had:  Kyrie  Kevin Love (who was still good in his first couple years with Cleveland)  D-Wade (mostly injury prone Wade but he had prime Wade for an entire season)  Chris Bosh  Prime Anthony Davis  6MOY Montrezl Harrell  6MOY Candidate Dennis Schroder  Ilgauskas (who was a 2x all star)  I honestly don’t know who had more help
"Dennis Schroder has the 2nd best defensive rating for any PG in the NBA, first being Ben Simmons who’s going to finish top 3 for DPOY voting. He’s also playing on a contender who has almost no choice but to overpay him. If he walks we still barely have any cap space and we lose him for nothing. He has tons more leverage than Lonzo does.  Lonzo is at most worth ~18-20 mill a year. He’s inconsistent and lacks motor, he can’t drive and collapse defenses and as a PG supposedly worth 18 mill+ that’s a huge liability. Maybe it’s a coaching thing because SVG isn’t great either but he has very clear weaknesses for a starting PG. Team that pays him 20m+ a year is going to regret it."
"Dennis Schroder turned down 22m. Lonzo is younger and probably going past 22m then. His max is 28m, so maybe gets something offered somewhere b/t 22-28m."
Dennis Schroder. I think his hair looks stupid + he plays for the Lakers

https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/5/15/22438022/dennis-schroder-covid-19-protocols-nba-playoffs-vaccine-comments-lakers  He says he's the only guy not vaxxed in this interview
PG - Luka Doncic  SG - Paul George  SF - Kyle Kuzma  PF - Julius Randle  C - Kristaps Porzingis  6th man: Dennis Schroder  (this is a very tall team)
Per Dennis everyone besides Schroder was vaccinated. So that implies Lebron is vaccinated. I don’t know for sure obviously
Dennis Schroder was shit in the playoffs after contracting Covid
"[here’s the statement fam. ](https://mobile.twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/1396969630619504641) please show me where it says LeBron is vaccinated, and with the Dennis Schroder interview too there’s more evidence that he’s not vaxxed than he is."
"Tony Parker is still the gold standard for small guards finishing in the paint and around the rim. He basically pioneered the floater that every guard does now, and he had all the up-and-unders and spin moves to score efficiently off drives even though he played below the rim.  I look at someone like Dennis Schroder and I just wish he would study some more Tony Parker tape and try to emulate it. Having the first step to get into the paint whenever you want is nice, but it's only worth so much if you can't finish."
He's what laker fans through Dennis schroder would be
"&gt;You’re a fucking rat bitch.  Wow, there's a convincing argument.  &gt;How can you act like an NBA know it all,  It's not actually an act.  &gt; is Dennis Schroder is a good fit next to Lebron and AD.  I explained it repeatedly, generally using small enough words that you should've been able to understand.  Perhaps the problem is just that you are dumb as a stump?"
Wow a Dennis Schroder stan. Now I've seen everything.
"You’re a fucking rat bitch. How can you act like an NBA know it all, and the take you’re defending is Dennis Schroder is a good fit next to Lebron and AD. You’re a fucking idiot."
dennis schroder after going 0/9 in game 5
Reggie Jackson and Dennis Schroder are 2 feathers of a bird.
"&gt;You cannot convince me that Lowry would be worse than Schroder in the playoffs, which are the only games that really matter.  As a matter of fact, getting to the playoffs matters as well.  Something Lowry found out this season.  &gt;Teams just sag off Dennis and he hurts spacing. And his decision making is sub par.  You would have a much more convincing argument if you were aware of the basic facts of the situation.  Schroder led the Lakers in assist/turnover ratio this season.  And again, was 23rd in the league in assists.  &gt;That guy Mike James on Brooklyn would be a better fit on the Lakers.  That you don't know how stupid this is, is frankly, amazing.  James is so good he couldn't even make the NBA until he was 27 years old, and has played 49 career games -- at age 30.  James was on the street 2 months ago, and hadn't played in the NBA in two years, since being waived by New Orleans.  Exactly because no NBA team considers him a capable player."
"You cannot convince me that Lowry would be worse than Schroder in the playoffs, which are the only games that really matter. Teams just sag off Dennis and he hurts spacing. And his decision making is sub par. That guy Mike James on Brooklyn would be a better fit on the Lakers. We need composed ball handlers and 3 point threats."
How to lose 84 million by Dennis Schroder
Magic Johnson SHOOTS HARD on Dennis Schroder.
He was always a little deluded if he thought we was gonna play so well that he could get more. Like peak Dennis schroder is worth 20 mil and we haven't seen that guy in a long time
"Dennis Schroder is an idiot.  So are his friends and his missing financial advisor.  He turned down a guaranteed $84,000,000 deal for a chance at $110-120 million.   Gaining 40 million is much less worth than losing 40 million. Very unlikely he will get 4/60 now. His ceiling is probably  4/40-4/50 at best and with a good chance a 1yr/12mil and/or 2/24."
Imagine being Dennis Schroder and thinking you're worth more than 21 mil a year
"&gt;They traded for him because the Laker really needed a secondary playmaker when Bron was on the bench and he was coming off as a top 6moy candidate.  Which is precisely what Schroder gave them.  The only secondary ballhandlers who averaged more than his 5.8 assists per game: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Sabonis, McConnell, Brogdon \].  Schroder was also 23rd in the league in assists.  &gt;so yeah starting caruso  Did you see what happened when Caruso did start?  It was brutal.  Caruso was -7.2/100 as a starter, and +6.6/100 as a reserve.  I like Caruso a ton, but he is not, and probably never will be, a starter-caliber NBA point guard.  &gt;but demanding a starting role isn't the best thing for team chemistry.  Neither is refusing to play center.  At least in Schroder's case his demand was clearly the best option for the team -- and really not in any sort of doubt, anyway.  There was practically no other option but to start to Schroder.  His demand was about as meaningful as if Davis had demanded to start.  That said, ""demand"" is strong for his [actual quotes on the matter.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)"
" Schroder had to deal with Mikal Bridges who previously had the assignment of AD before he was out. Bridges is an elite perimeter defender who has length on a smaller  Schroder, who can't consistently attack the basket with Mikal on him. If his shot isn't falling, which is usually the case, then he is completely neutralized on offense if you take away his penetration. It's unfair to blame Dennis without acknowledging the defense that shut him down."
"Possible to become Dennis ""I got my family to feed"" Schroder II?  For the newer fans. Latrell Sprewell said those exact words after he turned down a 3 years $21 million deal. He was never offered a new contract by any team after that (he stank it up in his last year)."
"Schroder was probably the fourth biggest reason the Lakers lost in the first round and that's being generous.  They lost because AD got hurt, LeBron was below average for his standards, Montrezl Harrell proved to be unplayable (nice job Clippers on spotting that) and their duo of Drummond/Gasol at the center spot CLEARLY was a horrible idea.  Putting the blame on Schroder as if he was expected to be anything more than a guy that comes in, gives 12-14 points a game and makes some mistakes is just revisionist history. AD being hurt and LeBron's worst playoff series since the 2011 Finals is what doomed the Lakers, not Dennis."
"Dennis ""Nerlens Noel"" Schroder."
"I’m not sure why the same clause wouldn’t be triggered... maybe so the teams losing the player at least have a chance at recouping some value? Your guess would be as good as mine here.    As for the Lakers... I think Schroder ends up getting signed and traded. I have two destinations/scenarios in mind.    Mavericks receive: Dennis Schroder    Lakers receive: Tim Hardaway Jr.    Dallas gets another ball handler to take some of the workload off Luka, Lakers get a knockdown shooter to pair with LeBron and AD.    This next one is a little creative:    Knicks receive: Dennis Schroder    Raptors receive: assets from NY    Lakers receive: Kyle Lowry"
not sure ive ever been more certain of anything in my life than i am of the fact that the lakers will not be offering dennis schroder 180 million
dennis schroder.
"Jeremy Lin, Kyle Kuzma, Tingus Pingus, Julius Randle, Dennis Schroder about to form a super team"
Who exactly are the Knicks going to be targeting this summer? Are they still going to want to go after Dennis Schroder like was reported a few months ago?
"During the Lakers series, Booker held:  * Dennis Schroder to 27% FG% on 3 of 11 shooting * KCP to 14.3% FG% on 1 of 7 shooting * Markieff Morris to 20% FG% on 1 of 5 shooting * Alex Caruso to 25% FG% on 1 of 4 shooting * Kyle Kuzma to 0% FG% on 0 of 2 shooting  AD, Lebron, and Drummond, obvious mismatches on Booker, were the only players to shoot 50% or above when Booker was the primary defender."
Reggie Jackson about to make the money Dennis Schroder thinks he deserves
Reggie Jackson should get the contract Dennis schroder is asking for
"The laws of Los Angeles Basketball means that the Lakers and Clippers regularly swap players. This means that we'll swap 1 Dennis Schroder for 1 Reggie Jackson.  Sorry Clippers fans, that's just the rules here."
"The nuggets were actively hunting him on defense repeatedly in game 1(and it worked a number of times) go tell them he’s this “good defender”. This happens all the time also LeBron hunts him when he can, Kawhi hunted him repeatedly when they played this year etc. CP3 is just doing his job hyping his teammate up he said last year Dennis schroder deserved all nba defense consideration.   Bookers been balling out on offense this postseason people don’t even need to be doing this"
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shlomosprung/2021/05/13/spencer-dinwiddie-discusses-returning-to-brooklyn-nets-this-season-from-torn-acl-progress-on-his-calaxy-app/?sh=53d7fcc22c30  he's floated the idea that he's worth $20-25M as a starter.  i guess this is more seeing if he can get other teams to bite and then seeing if brooklyn will increase their offer, but like he and dennis schroder have similar efficiency and other basic stats (although dinwiddie is taller and bigger and schroder is actually more efficient, he just takes fewer shots than dinwiddie did last year). i thought the theory was that schroder could get $100M/4yr because the lakers had no way of replacing him if he dipped, but he wasn't worth that on the open market.  but however rich the nets owners are, i feel like they have a limit to what extra they're willing to spend on a backup PG.  on mobile I can't write a comment while looking at my previous one but iirc i thought next year they'd basically be $30M over the luxury tax threshold without dinwiddie for a tax bill of $93M.  if he got just $20M then being $50M over takes the tax bill to $248M.  does the additional $170M+ of his salary and the additional tax _ensure_ a chip in the event kyrie or harden is unavailable?  maybe it's worth it to them if it does, but...."
The only thing the Lakers can afford is re-signing Dennis Schroder.  And there's a chance not even that happens.  They are mega-fucked if he doesn't get re-signed.
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
"Also this years free agent class sucks so someone will pay a decent amount to grab a former sixth man who can still be good. Besides CP3 and kawhi who I don’t think are seriously leaving the marquee free agents are Lowry, demar, and then like Dennis schroder"

"&gt; He’s just too old for this shit he wants to be playing with all stars not scrubs like Marc Gasol and Dennis Schroder  &gt;&gt; He’s 36 and not totally healthy. That’s my point. He’s not gonna carry some bums like he did in his early 30s, literally thousands of playing minutes ago.  What’s the difference tho…"
Lebron has played with far worse and didn’t give up on his team. He’s just too old for this shit he wants to be playing with all stars not scrubs like Marc Gasol and Dennis Schroder
Dennis Schroder. You should get him. He's amazing. Hunt him down. You won't regret it.
Dennis Schroder and Kentavious Caldwell Pope
"&gt;In some preseason conference Schroder was like “ I already did this come off the bench thing last year. I came here to start”, as soon as he dropped that “come off the bench thing” which is peak Dennis schroder I knew his role/what he’s looking for/how he approaches things was something to monitor this year  Just curious. Who was he supposed to come off the bench for exactly? He played behind CP3 in OKC. Who on the Lakers was he supposed to play behind?  THT? Caruso who the Lakers obviously prefer to come off the bench?  Wesley Matthews?  I’m just trying to understand things from your perspective."
Dennis schroder still has plenty to offer on another team in a different situation.
"Flipping Danny Green and not resigning Dwight are probably the only moves that could even possibly qualify as mistakes. Danny for Schroder is only a bad move in hindsight, and even then Dennis provided solid playmaking and scoring that the Lakers *desperately* needed for a lot of the season, which Green would not have been able to provide. Not resigning Dwight was stupid, but it's not like he's a *huge* impact player or anything, he was DNP'd for tons of the playoffs last year and doesn't solve the Laker's core problem of bad shooting. Drummond probably played better than Dwight would have this series, for instance. Plus, GM's can't really be expected to predict locker room issues, which is really the only other major flaw the Lakers had this year. The fact is everything rests on whether LeBron and AD are fully healthy. Last year they were, this year they were not."
"Schroder is a very good defender. All those guys you listed are bums.   If Dennis learns how to sacrifice for the team he’d still be a great piece for our team. I’m just not sure that he’s willing to do that. He’s deadset on being a starter and being one of those untouchable type players, which he isn’t."
"oh no, not Dennis I didnt show up all playoff Schroder"
Dennis Schroder. 4Y/100M.  Let’s do this.
Dennis scapegoat Schroder
"This is rediculous to me, he is being treated as if he’s supposed to be their star player, he is Dennis Schroder, he’s nothing more then a role player"
"If you just concentrate on watching Schroder on both ends of the floor you can see how absolutely putrid he was. Mostly on the offensive side, of course. Just fuckin terrible.   In game 6 he was afraid to shoot when he needed to. As the game went on it was impossible for him to shoot threes off the dribble. Kept fucking over his teammates with poorly timed passes late in the shot clock. Like Wes Matthews in the corner with a man on him when Dennis should shoot it. Or to caruso on a fast break when he had a wide open floater.  I enjoyed watching Schroder when he was good during over half of the regular season, but jeez he fell off a cliff. On top on doing stupid things, saying stupid things, and anti-vax this is hopefully good riddance. Don't know if the pressure of betting on himself was a factor but it's nice to see him fail after turning that FAT extension down."
Oh man THJ is playing his way to a max while Dennis the Fraud Schroder wont even get a vet min. So sad
Lol magic does not like Dennis Schroder
reggie jackson might get paid more than dennis schroder this offseason damn
"""Dennis Schroder does not have winning mentality because they just went 2-4 against the Suns in the 1st round"""
Michaelangelo Muscala bleeds banana yellow and purple! He is a Lakers saint! Dennis Schroder can only hope to one day have his name in the rafters like the Muskrat.
"Dennis was going off in the 3rd quarter of that game.  9 points and a couple assists.  He took over defensively though.  Got some big deflections.  Got the crowd hyped.  Spearheaded the comeback before THT got a stupid tech and Morris got a stupid flagrant.  Cut the lead to 12 but they couldn't gain anymore ground.    I can't say I watch every Laker game (or even 10% of them) but watching Schroder last night, he was one of the few guys who had any heart at all in that game.    He didn't have too bad of a series if you ignore game 5."
Dennis Schroder is not a starting PG on a playoff level team
ha totally:  https://lakersdaily.com/devin-booker-takes-cocky-clever-shot-at-dennis-schroder-after-suns-end-lakers-season/  here's the post for the first screenshot: https://www.instagram.com/p/COqMFEVhvGY/?utm_medium=copy_link
"acting like the Suns just left everyone wide open for 3 is the real stretch here, they let the less than stellar shooters take whatever they wanted but they refused to allow dudes like KCP to get into any sort of rhythm.  of course the Suns aren't desperately closing out on Caruso, Schroder, Kuzma, etc. But dudes like KCP they were all over. But then again KCP was the only real shooting threat on this team, so it's not like they had to be overly active on the perimeter in terms of closing out for a shot, the Suns were fine to live and die by the dreaded Dennis Schroder 3 ball, and it clearly worked cause the Lakers could get nothing going and to no one's surprise the guys who couldn't shoot were not good shooters."
"Ain't that the truth, they looked gassed.  And Dennis Schroder, my god, the Lakers almost fucked up giving him a contract, he's worst than Bledsoe."
"Dennis Schroder yelled back ""That’s tuff 🔥💯"""
&gt; and for Dennis Schroder to learn mandarin  You think that'll be enough for LeBron to keep him around?
How about a little Dennis Schroder S&amp;T + Kyle Kuzma for CJ?  Let’s see how badly POR wants to shake it up.
The silver lining here is a long offseason for LeBron and AD to heal and for Dennis Schroder to learn mandarin.
This just in: Dennis Schroder has removed “starting PG for the LA Lakers” from his IG bio again
Get Dennis Schroder some help
"From Dennis the Menace to Dennis ""Danny Phantom"" Schroder"
Dennis Schroder about to change his IG bio for the 3rd time in one day
I never want to see dennis schroder ever again
"I understand having nagging injuries, but damn did the Lakers just play bad. I know LeBron is gonna get flamed for his antics, but I think the majority of the blame needs to go to the 100 million dollar man, Dennis Schroder. He played horrendous this series. Everyone on that team played so lackadaisical."
"So you're saying they could have used the exact opposite of Dennis ""The 100 Million Dollar Man"" Schroder"
"Dennis Schroder has removed ""NBA Playoff Participant"" from his Instagram Bio."
"Schroeder is making $15.5m, this year and turned down a $84m/4 offer from the Lakers.  Thing is that Rondo, though obviously excellent in the bubble, can't be the primary ballhandler (other than LBJ) for the entire regular season. Not even to talk of defense,   Danny Green and a FRP were traded for [Schroeder.](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/11/18/21573823/lakers-trade-dennis-schroder-danny-green-2020-nba-draft-analysis)  so it wasn't as if you could simply hand Danny Green's money to Rondo.   And Rondo got a 2 year $15m contract from the Hawks, who were not a contender, but did have a young PG whom Rondo could (the notion was) mentor and back up for an upcoming team.  The Lakers couldn't (wouldn't) practically hand out a 2 year contract to Rondo either after the championship"

So.... what kind of contract is Dennis Schroder getting now?
Dennis Schroder changed his position to hot garbage.

Lakers gonna fuck around and give Dennis the fraud Schroder a max contract
I would like Dennis Schroder put into a cannon and blasted off into the abyss
"Dennis Schroder is a bum, he need to step up!"
Fair take. I think if you're the Lakers you'd rather take on that deal and have depth at a key position on a team that rests its stars often than take a chance on veteran players developing into guys that can give you scoring when Bron and Davis are out. But I also get not wanting $22m/year of Dennis Schroder on your books. I'd lean towards #1 but it's close
Dennis Schroder is Delon Wright with Lakers brand cache
"Oh, yeah, that is a good point about the cap holds.  Although maybe just let Hart walk then and keep Ball and I think team could have some space if it could trade Adams without taking back money (which is obviously a huge if).  Yeah, actually getting someone good in FA could be tough. DeVonte Graham might be moving in FA.  Malik Monk.  Duncan Robinson.  Talen Horton-Tucker.  Dennis Schroder.  Some slim pickings."
dennis schroder &gt; lame time
"Dennis Schröder during an interview about triggering his second covid protocol, stated that he was the only player on the lakers that wasn't vaccinated.

"Dennis Schroder, Tingus Pingus"
"You guys aren't gonna be interested in Dame anyway, not when it's rumored that you guys are going to make a run at Dennis Schroder!"
Nets without Harden and Kyrie vs Lakers without AD and LeBron wouldn't really do well. I mean I'd care more about the finals than I do now because my team is there but I won't be soaking every second of the Dennis Schroder vs Landry Shamet duel.
Dennis Schroder doesn't play for the US team. Last I checked it was James nunnaly who had to play qualifier games and none of the big shots were lifting a finger for team USA.
"You're just talking about Dennis Schroder, don't act like it's everyone."
Dennis Schroder is an elite defender lol
Actually one of his redeeming factors is that he is a hound on defense. I know it's shit on dennis schroder week and i also hate his ass but dennis is a damn good defensive player.
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
"You can’t make a run at Lonzo tho, u need to sign and trade Dennis Schroder to NOLA and then get Lonzo from NOLA. If the knicks give him 100/4 then u guys are hard capped and can’t get anyone. I don’t think u know the financial stuff about your own team."
Demar Derozan. Dennis Schroder.
Imagine Lonzo making that much. That’s Dennis Schroder money!
"&gt; Dude all the international players are likeable in the league.   After a season of people talking about how Luka was insufferable on the court, Ben Simmons brother stirring shit up, and Dennis Schroder power playing the German national team until they qualified for the Olympic, that is a bad generalization."
Dennis Schroder has left the chat.
You’re right. Dennis Schroder is a bonafide star. Pay the man
"Players also get suspended if their flagrant foul count goes above three for the playoffs. I know Booker got a flagrant 2 in the first round for his shove on Dennis Schroder, but I don't know if he's had any since then. It might be worth seeing if anyone from either team is getting close on flagrant points as well."
"He's a slightly better Dennis Schroder, anything north of 12M is an overpay"
Bigger Dennis Schroder
Maria Taylor = Dennis Schroder
"This was the last reply I was expecting, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. I said it tongue-in-cheek but I don’t think it would happen for a couple reasons. I think the foremost reason is their difference in value. I think Murray is very underrated by NBA fans. He’s one of my favorite players in the NBA, I love his game. That being said, I think there are better offers SA could get if Murray was available. Murray is at least 1 tier above Kuz in terms of talent and value, you could even make an argument for him being 2 levels above Kuz. This leads into my second point.  My second point is I think it would take someone putting a gun to Pops head to trade with the Lakers. Pop isn’t going to do anything to make a rival better, much less the Lakers. I remember when Kawhi demanded a trade to the Lakers and Pop basically said over my dead body is Kawhi going to the Lakers. That may be the bigger hurdle honestly, would be getting Pop to deal with the Lakers.  Regarding Kuz, his game really isn’t that bad. He’s actually right when he’s talking about his role. Do I believe he can be an all-star level player? Maybe he has 1-2 great seasons and gets in as a reserve, but I don’t think he’s going to be a perennial all-star at any point in his career. His role has changed pretty much every single year he’s been on the Lakers. He’s gone from starter to bench player to somewhere in between over the course of his young career. He was an iso scorer mostly with the baby Lakers who had a solid post game. He got a lot of minutes when the Lakers were bad and showed the ability to score, but he was a black hole on defense. Now, he’s become a much improved (dare I say good) defender. He has the ability to guard 2-4 and be OK. If he was on a team like SA and they gave him starter minutes for a season with him as one of the focal points on offense, I really do not think it’s out of the question for him to average around 17-18 PPG.   Me personally, I would trade anyone not named LeBron or AD for Murray. I would hesitate on THT. I am by no means a THT stan like some Laker fans are (I was all in on them shipping THT/Dennis/KCP for Lowry at the deadline) but THT+Kuz+22 would make me pause for a second. He has really flashed and then there are moments he looks absolutely lost on the court, such is life when you’re 20 years old and in the NBA. I’ve internally gone back and forth on whether or not I want Demar on the Lakers. I do not believe he is a great fit for their team and what they’re trying to do, but he should, in theory, provide offense, especially during minutes when Bron/AD are out. Derozans playmaking has been a revelation over the last couple years. It would be an interesting move, but my fear is that it would be sort-of similar to the Lakers getting Schroder to be that secondary ball handler and provide a punch when Bron and AD rest (lol) and that was not the case.   If Murray is truly available, I hope the Lakers jump all over it. He is the player I would want the most out of anyone on SA, but I can’t see them giving up what looks to be a key part of their future. I would be meh on White, and Derozan would scare and excite me at the same time. Yet knowing the Spurs, they’ll make a trade where they get a second rounder or two and find another Manu lmao. I think both those guys (Murray and White) will stay put, but if SA moves either of them, my money is on White going. Will be very interesting to see how this plays out!"
Dennis Schroder thinks so
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There’s really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year’s team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."
That's Dennis Schroder type of money
Dennis Schroder bot saying his iconic tweet.

Seems like she is journalist version of Dennis Schroder.
Lakers PR team? Dennis Schroder
This just in! Dennis schroder wants his 100 million to be paid in euros.
"I actually saw Dennis Schroder at a grocery store in LA yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
&gt; Dennis Schroder is a shitty person  fair  &gt; who should have been out of the league after he and friends beat someone badly  Professional sports has been around way too long for people to still have these draconian fantasies.  Nothing works like this. In any industry if the PR hit can be contained (which it most definitely can) it doesn't matter. If it can't be contained and the commodity still has value things will lay on the backburner until it can.  Does it suck? Sure. Is it a hard concept to grasp? Absolutely not.
[Link ](https://www.google.co.nz/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2017/09/29/dennis-schroder-initiated-fight-at-hookah-bar-police-report/)   iirc the guy ended up needing replacement knee surgery
"As someone who follows the German national team, you’re lying straight through your teeth. Dennis isn’t playing right now because Germany wouldn’t cover his insurance as a player entering free agency in the NBA. He wanted to play since the beginning, but wasn’t allowed to.  In case you don’t believe me, I took this quote from Schroder from an article: “It’s to my regret that the team will have to do without me in Split and I can’t support them,” Schroder said. “I’m convinced that the guys will still make the Olympics and I’m already looking forward to the EuroBasket 2022 in Germany.”  Not only that, but Dennis has been cheering on the team as a Spectator all 4 games, he wants to be there supporting them."
"He’s done it to himself. He was out in public with no marks posting pics, he was playing video games and streaming during games he missed due to his own ignorance. He came out and said he didn’t get vaccinated and threw a second teammate under the bus as well for it. Add in the dud playoffs for him and all the talk about how he’s only about money and his own role not the team and no one needs to spill tea on him.    Dennis Schroder is a shitty person who should have been out of the league after he and friends beat someone badly."
We were hoping for that out of Dennis Schroder but he went completely opposite of John Collins.
He's going to want Dennis Schroder money...lol
"It's ok bro I thought Dennis Schroder was going to be an all star in 2017. 😑 not a possible worse take, okay? He was the highest blocked player in NBA season before."
"Nowitzki yelled, “There you go!” Mortiz Wagner gave a look of pleasant surprise. Robin Benzing belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before  Andreas Obst hit the locker room door, ex-Germany star Dennis Schroder hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
dennis schroder for 120 mil
Bullshit. Devin Booker shoved Dennis Schroder while he was in the air and that was worse than the CP3. Devin did'nt get suspended for that bush league.
"Cameron Payne, Reggie Jackson, Dennis Schroder"
"  why does the round matter? why does the level of dennis schroder matter? so because dennis isnt a number 1 or 2 option its fine if booker tries to push him when he was mid air?? yea pat bev could have hurt paul, booker could have hurt dennis. I also dont think cp3 was going to be that badly hurt cause of him being pushed from behind. Both pat bev and booker were sore losers.  Also crowder shoving his goddam fingers into pg13 could have easily hurt his eyes. He was just being a sore loser cause pg was cooking him and decided to try to blind him"
"&gt; You had a 36-year-old lebron james average 23/7/8?  Exactly my point...  &gt;You had ""the best offseason acquisitions"" in Dennis Schroder, Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond, and Wesley Matthews?  Drummond was a mid-season acquisition.   &gt;But a GOOD coach and a GOOD leader would rally the troops to step up. Caruso, THT, Schroder, for all the praise they were getting? They were TRASH. And Lebron gave up on his team once his co-star went out.  What praise were Caruso and THT getting? LeBron “gave up” because his ankle gave up."

"People are in the honeymoon period with the Suns right now, but fans are going to turn on them soon since CP3 has always been a dirty flopper and Booker does bush league shit like pushing Dennis Schroder out of the air intentionally."
"I mean it's not even just that. If it was a one off incident, sure it was a mistake and I understand it. But he has continuously and intentionally tried to hurt multiple players who are objectively better than him, has blatantly mocked players for their injuries, and spoke down to greats like Steph for no fucking reason. I'm not the one to judge player's characters (see people calling Dennis Schroder a dumbass for asking 100+ million), but Bev is unequivocally a terrible person in basketball and is a liability for the NBA. As I said before, he does not deserve a spot on an NBA roster and I'd love to see him succeed in real life with his bitchass attitude"
Dennis Schroder hasn't even Dennis Schrodered a team yet.

What a clown.  No way she is more valuable than Stephen A even if he's annoying to most people.  He carries that network.  Basically she's a Dennis Schroder who didn't take the initial $5 million offer and now post-pandemic thinks she can get more but the value dropped? Lol.
"Dennis ""Sprewell"" Schroder"
"Dennis Schroder: You don’t have to give it to me all at once. I’m flexible, you can pay it all over 2 or 3 years."
"They'll need to resign him but they can play the waiting game.  if Dennis doesn't sign at the beginning of the season, the Lakers don't have to blink. Stick to a reasonable 16M/year offer. If Dennis tries what TT did to the Cavs, then give THT more run at PG. No one in hungry for a PG right now and schroder has to compete with Dinwiddie in the offseason. If you can sign Dinwiddie for less, why throw so much money at Schroder? All the contenders have  a PG. And the non contenders arent gonna spend money just coz they can."

Report: Dennis Schroder signs for vet minimum with Orlando Magic.
"This is a level of self ignorance I have never seen before. Like since players know exactly what they are worth and know not to dip to far below to avoid feeling cheated.   This man DENNIS SCHRODER, a ROLE-PLAYER at his best, just asked for 100-120 million dollars in free agency. If this motherfucker don't cut the bullshit out he is gonna find himself sitting on the couch like me while next season gets underway."
BREAKING NEWS : Dennis Schroder admitted to psych ward; suffering from delusional fantasies.
Team chemistry is a thing and dennis schroder attitude and ego will hurt the locker room. I'd rather we let him walk for nothing if we can't find a sign and trade.
Dennis schroder is not that guy
"(PPG + ((APG + RPG) x 2)) x 1,000,000 = roughly how much you NBA players are worth if you're a starter level player. All Star/All NBA adds 5 mil.  LeBron = 25 ppg, 7.7 apg, 7.8 rpg in that formula is 37.7 mil. Actual salary is 37.4  Curry = 32, 5.5, 5.8 = 42.65 mil. Actual = $40.23 mil  Derozan = 21.6, 4.2, 6.9 = 29.25 mil. Actual = $27.7 mil  Jayson Tatum = 26.4, 7.4, 4.3 = 37.25 mil. If he had been named All NBA (missed by one spot) his new contract would average roughly that per year  Dennis Schroder = 15.5, 3.5, 5.8 = 20.15 mil. If he signs a 5 year deal he might get $100 mil"
Dennis Schroder made the team actively worse. It would be better to have an empty roster spot than to have him on the bench — at any price.
Dennis Schroder
Report:  Dennis Schroder 'has admitted' he is high
Dennis Schroder is so relatable. I can't believe he likes money too. We should hang out.
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis Schroder
"Dennis Schroder too, his north-south quickness was pretty gone."
The clippers are a big jump up in talent and the guard position from the other teams PHX has played. Who was the best guard CP3/Booker played in the first 2 rounds?  Dennis Schroder? Austin Rivers?
"It's the honeymoon period with the Suns right now, but Booker has done some bush league stuff like pushing Dennis Schroder out of the air intentionally and CP3 has always been super annoying."
Reggie Jackson is who Dennis Schroder wishes he was
He averaged 5 ppg in the playoffs last year compared to Schroder who averaged 17ppg. Which explains why people were saying Dennis was better.   But hindsight is 20/20 lmao you can look back and say this for a lot of player comparisons
He can't go due to insurance https://lakersdaily.com/report-dennis-schroder-wont-join-germany-in-olympic-qualifiers-due-to-insurance-coverage-issue/  Didn't find anything on Franz Wagner so I assume he just didn't make the team.
Yeah it is odd. Dennis Schroder is not there as well. I'd say he is the most notable player not on the team.
"Do you not feel like these playoffs have been tainted by all the injuries? My being a Laker fan should have absolutely nothing to do with the validity of me saying it sucks that almost every star player has gotten hurt in this postseason, with yet another one tonight. If you prefer that there's a ton of injuries and feel like it's added some extra excitement to these playoffs, then you and I just have different tastes I guess.   Personally I would have rather seen how all these teams could have done against each other with everyone at full strength, so these wins and losses would have had that feeling like they were genuinely meaningful. Instead it kinda feels like whomever wins is probably gonna be the only team that wasn't decimated by injuries rather than the best team overall.   I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. The last time this year the Lakers and Nets played each other LeBron, AD and Harden were all out with injuries, and Kyrie and Dennis Schroder got ejected about halfway through. The Lakers ended up winning by like 20 points, but even as a Laker fan I felt like the result was totally meaningless. What could I possibly take away from a game in which so many critical players weren't playing?   I feel the same way about these playoffs. Do I feel like anything has really been answered here? Next year if people want to say that like the Suns proved they were better than the Clippers, my honest feeling is gonna be ""did they?"" And it's that same thing for most playoff series we've had. How many of them delivered a result which was untainted by key injuries? It's unsatisfying to me, but if it is for you, then kudos I guess."
Dennis Schroder was also MIA this postseason.
dennis schroder is a brick shooter does he count
"We're talking about Dennis Schroder though, he'll probably be looking at about half that. Ain't nobody giving him anywhere close to $100 million."
Not Dennis Schroder. He was all about the bag and he blew it.
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"
"The 76ers really lost to:  * A 5'10, 140-lb balding assassin  * Dennis Schroder on HGH  * A generically named power forward  * The Rooster  * Lemon Pepper Lou  * Some ['Vic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tWf9264e6k) with a big nose  * And last but not least, Richie Cunningham"
"And, OKC's second best player was Dennis Schroder."
Dennis Schroder
"4 years ago they didn't have Trae yet, and their best player was Dennis Schroder lol."
"&gt; Dennis Schroder ganged up on and beat the hell out of a guy, NBA media never brings that up.  LeSPN will bring it up when Schroeder is off the Lakers"
Dennis Schroder to the Knicks for 4 years / $100 million with a player option in year 4.
These clowns actually think it’s a real quote 😂.  It’s what Magic Johnson said about Dennis Schroder.
"And to think, 23 days ago, he was a fraud player whose head Dennis Schroder lived in rent free, and he was a soft ass punk who whined about double teams.   Clips sent a double at him every play and he looked at them like “bro? I’m not who you think I am” and made a fool out of the double every time."
Dennis schroder
Dennis Schroder?
Dennis Schroder is not worth any more than the MLE.
Dennis Schroder really wasn't that bad against the Suns
"Kemba + 16th pick for Horford:  - I didn't really like this deal at first, but once it was clear that OKC had to buy Kemba out, while not getting anything in return, makes me feel better. 16th pick for losing 8mil in salary + better fit + better defense + more future flexibility is....ok. Grade = C  Dennis Schroder:  - I don't know how this happened, but it's pretty amazing. We needed more offense and we needed another PG. The fact that we got a 12+mil player for half the price is amazing. He's not here long-term, but still amazing. Grade = A+  Williams extension:  - He is getting paid like Holmes. Advanced stats and Per 36 numbers suggest that Williams is at least on par with Holmes on both ends of the floor, so, in theory, it's fair value. If Williams stays healthy I think it will be an underpay, (much like Holmes contract). If Williams stays hurt, then he's overpaid, but by only 3ish mil per year imo, so still not horrible. I think this is a fair contract. Grade = B  Marcus Smart:  - I wouldn't look too much into his defensive decline last year. Everyone on the team struggled defensively and we had 0 consistency in terms of lineup. No one is talking about what did against the Nets, where he was clearly our 2nd best player night-in and night-out on both ends of the floor. His half-court play-making is severely underrated. His shooting is ass and will always be ass. He's cheaper than Ball and older than Ball, but I think there are things he does better and things he's worse at. I think this is a fair contract. Grade = B  Josh Richardson:  - Eh, not great. Not bad. He won't stick around next year, but he helps our defense, which was a middling one last year. He is part of a series of additions/subtractions that, in theory, should vault the C's defense back to top 5 status. I wanted more out of the TPE, but getting him for free ain't bad. Grade = C+  Kanter:  - Solid rebounder. Solid scorer. Solid defender against Embiid and big/lumbering centers. Otherwise, meh. He was cheap and will be our 3rd string center. I think we got him for cheaper than he is worth, so it was a good signing. Also, with Horford and Rob potentially missing games due to injury and age, we needed a 3rd stringer who could spot start reliably and Kanter can do that well. Grade = B+  TT for Dunn + 2nd rounder  - Lol I thought TT had negative value in a trade, so the fact we got positive value AND a cheaper contract, really nothing to complain about. I suspect Brad is looking to dump Dunn + someone else to get under the luxury tax, so Dunn isn't doing much for us. The real value is getting something for negative value imo. Grade = A  Draft  - I mean, we only had a 2nd rounder. He looks good, but will be overseas. I can't really give this a value yet. No idea what he's going to be. I lumped losing the 16th pick in with the Kemba deal, so this draft was....idk. Grade = Incomplete  Overall:  - I think it was a successful off-season overall. Our bench is better, our defense is better, and we are better suited to improve this team going forward. We got some good value players and re-signed guys on fair contracts, (I don't think either is overpaid or underpaid). That being said, I don't think we got fair value for the 16th pick, I don't think we are a title contender, and most of the good signings/acquisitions are likely gone by next year. I think we had an above average off-season, but not great and not on the fringes of great either. Just above average. Grade = B"
**lOwRy fOr DeNnIs ScHrOdEr! WhO sAys No?**
I'm dying thinking about Stevens nuking the team for picks and Middleton lmao..  Starting lineup:  PG: Dennis Schroder SG: Khris Middleton SF: Aaron Nesmith PF: Enes Kanter C: Robert Williams  Come on that gets MAYBE 10th seed in the East..
"Scary Terry getting paid.....  Dennis Schroder seeing this news in Germany, and going DAMN, guaranteed $$$$$$$ and all. LOL"
I don't know that much about rozier but I haven't heard anything about him that makes him unlikable like schroder afaik rozier got the vaccine unlike Dennis and he isn't fighting people outside of restaurants.
"Jesus I feel bad already. Is he that better than Schroder? As an OKC fan who liked Dennis when he was here, at he was good enough to be a 6MOTY candidate. I haven't seen much of Rozier but a long-term max contract extension, really? Especially with LaMelo and Bouk on the roster.  I know he had attitude problems so he kinda deserved being memed to death. And it's really his fault for turning down the initial offer. But people shit on Dennis like they're offended for his idea of himself deserving a 20m/year contract while guys like Rozier easily get paid this much."
Y all forgot to mention point god Dennis Schroder
"*Dennis Schroder wakes up in the middle of night sweating*  “Man, I had a nightmare Terry Rozier got the same deal I turned down”  *‘Scary’ Terry pops his head out of the closet wearing a Jason mask.*  “That’s Tough 💯🔥”"
Thats dennis schroder money
"&gt;And then we replaced Dennis Schröder with Russell Westbrook.  Oh you mean the Westbrook who carried the Wizards to (checks notes) 8th seed in the East?  He's also struggled these past couple of years. He's an improvement over Schroder but he's not someone who can carry a depleted roster anymore.  &gt;They had Murray for most of the season…  They actually won more after he got injured. They went from a ~50-win pace to a ~60-win pace. He's huge for them in the playoffs but he's generally nothing amazing in the regular season.   &gt;What you don’t seem to understand is Jokic misses even 10 or 15 games and the Nuggets are fucked.   Jokic has missed 2 games over the last 3 seasons in total. That's 268 games played out of a possible 270.  Which is why the Nuggets have been 3rd, 3rd and 2nd in the West over the past 3 seasons.   &gt;(unlikely for LeBron)  Huh?  In his 3 LA seasons, you've been 10th and 7th seeds precisely because he's started to miss significant time to injuries. He's one of the most durable players in NBA history, but he is slowing down now.  &gt;If Jokic gets injured, the Nuggets are left with Monte Morris and MPJ.  And if your aunty had a dick she'd be your uncle."
Lol at dennis schroder
"I feel like Dennis is the regular season was playing up to the mark. It's only the post covid stuff. If yall remember, the Lakers stayed afloat a long time due to the heroics of Kuz and Schroder after LeBron went down."
"Dennis on reddit trying to reinflat his own value.   ""Is Dennis the best player on the celtics? He might be, Brad should max him hin 2022"" - not Dennis Schroder"
"2021-22 Chinese Basketball Association Dream Team    PG Isiah Thomas    SG Dennis Schroder    SF Joe Harris    PF Ben Simmons    Center Rudy Gobert     Bench: Bradon Knight, John Wall, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
"lol her kyrie defense and slander is so weird. she says nice things about him then in the same conversation she accidentally does full blown racism on him. and had to apologize over it a week later.   that whole crew bill, russillo and jackie. did some of the most veiled anti muslim commentary. source am muslim enjoy most of their podcast until they started to complain about enes kanter fasting. ""do you have to talk about it every game who cares give it a break"". then they went wild with speculation making fun of kyrie missing games right when ramadan 2021 started during the regular season. these guys hate kyrie i under stand that but he came saying he took. a day to learn to fast and play.   its a good way to introduce some people who never interacted with muslims a taste of them. its not like all november and december i am shoved with christmas related event tv show movies and conversation about it. you dont see non christmas celebrating individuals complain over two months. you get those two guys complain over like 5 games enes played during the playoffs.    also johnthan tjarks said something long the lines jlin is a solid and good christian. when atlanta signed or traded for jermey lin right when they got rid of dennis schroder. dennis is a head case but its not definitely because of his religion. which again pretty tiny stuff but they have a long list of balant anti muslim takes. and its not even the funny and full on racist kind which is easily dismissed.  these people try to be understanding of other cultures but that famous oh no my santa monica promenade. go destory something else rant pretty much showed who they really are."
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."
warriors this season somehow won a game off the healthy lakers (before AD and lebron's injuries).  dennis schroder was their lead scorer.
Wow add ELITE midrange shooter to Dennis Schroder name.   Put some RESPEK on it
It’s so funny how the narrative for IT and Schroder are vastly different despite both players having similar confidence in themselves and outcomes  The counter argument will be be that IT balled out for Boston that postseason but that would be like comparing Dennis to his OKC season: IT got put in a place next to lebron and couldn’t play.   IT’sdesire for the brinks trunk would put him in the same place as DS this summer even if he didn’t play in the 2017 playoffs
Now do it with Dennis Schroder
Dennis Schroder
[right here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2766903-dennis-schroder-may-face-felony-battery-charge-after-fight-that-led-to-arrest)
They'll really just have to ride it out to the best of their abilities and hope Schroder doesn't activate Playoff Dennis this season.
"Maybe things don't work out in Houston? Why possibly cost yourself potential future opportunities over a tweet?  What if Dennis Schroder had been dumping on the city of Boston for the last year? Would that have affected his offer?  It's important as an adult to understand there aren't unlimited opportunities in the world, and senselessly burning bridges may not be the smartest move."
No one can ever forget that Dennis Schroder shot 0/9 in a crucial game in the playoffs
Schroder about to play backup for a guy who just got a fat payday that is less than the bag he refused earlier this year.   Get fucked Dennis
They got Marcus smart and Dennis Schroder for the price of a Dennis Schroder last year
Dennis Schroder in game 5 against the suns.
Dennis “$100 million” Schroder
"He has Dennis schroder and Marcus smart starting over him next season, he’s obviously not good enough, immanuel quickley is still playing in summer league lighting it up and getting better against NBA competition, so yea as a 3rd string PG he’s gonna play on the same exact day in a pointless pro am game then the nba summer league game with nba competition, doesn’t make any sense on how that’s helping him get better for next season, he’s the 3rd string point guard he needs all the nba game reps he can get"
"Wtf are u saying? They just held out Jalen green and cade Cunningham from summer league so they wouldn’t get injured, you are a straight clown... Why would he care about the point guard below him on the depth chart? There trying to take his spot also in the NBA also.. how does it make any sense at all that he’s gonna sit out of a game full of NBA competition so he won’t get injured, to go play on the same exact day and drop 92 points against scrubs like high schoolers and college players in a pointless pro am game, he has Dennis schroder and Marcus smart starting over him next season, and he doesn’t wanna get as much NBA reps and NBA game time that he can get? The experience you get in game is totally different from practice and even pointless pro am"

Dennis Schroder and friends are making it 1 in 3
"&gt;Lakers might not even had made the playoffs running back with the 2020 squad if everything played out the same with Bron &amp; AD injuries  There is no chance they sniff the playoffs with Danny Green instead of Dennis Schroder in 2021, all else being equal."
"**MVP**: **Kevin Durant**. Best player on the best team, now with chemistry. I think he will eclipse his GSW stats considerably because Brooklyn isn't afraid to play iso. Don't buy the stars cancel out theory. Steph up there as well.  **DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo.** I think Gobert (unfairly)  will get docked for being somewhat exposed on the perimeter. I don't think anyone else will genuinely be in the running. I think Jonathan Isaac will be a conversation, but no chance of winning.  **6MOY: Dennis Schroder**, I think Payton Pritchard will start at PG.  **ROTY: Jalen Green**, with Suggs close behind. Cade will get Dwane Casey'd for at least first half of the season.  **MIP: Jonathan Isaac**. Maybe a homer pick, but could be Orlando's leading scorer. He has a lot of offensive game he hasn't really unleashed because he plays like a pastor, and was starting to turn around his mentality before the injury.  **COTY: Billy Donovan**, I think the Bulls are being underrated because none of the names are splashy individually, but when you break it down each player is going into the best fit of his career offensively. Billy Donovan has historically gotten good team defences out of bad individual defenders. IMO they will be a top 3 seed in the East, behind the Bucks and Nets.  **Exec of the Year: Arturas Karnisovas** - see above.  **Champions: Nets (KD)** - Talent."
Actually Dennis Schroder tbh. Its nuts how a single playoff series can change the value of a player this much. I think social media &amp; especially Magics statement on him played with peoples heads. Yes he fucked up by not taking the 4 year deal with the lakers but damn how can a single playoff series where the rest of the team was also shit/injured make his value drop this hard
"Well... I'm going to throw a curve ball out here.   Guys like Fox and KAT may be underrated, much in the way that Devin Booker has been underrated given that the Suns sucked for so long.   The thing is, most fans still think these guys are great players.  I think that, to find a player who is truly underrated, you have to go for a guy that people absolutely shit on .  So I'm going with a coin toss between Andre Drummond and Dennis Schroder.   People are absolutely shitting on those two, and the are actually solid players.   People are bemoaning Schroders poor play in this year's post season, but they ignore that, while recovering from COVID, he dropped three 20+ point games to go with those single-digit and zero-point point performances.   He isn't a bad defender. He's a solid play maker. A solid shooter when in a regular system. And he can score and create shots.   Drummond, well... he's not the defender you'd hope a center would be; however, he's one of the league's best rebounders, and for those who say ""He just grabs his own misses,"" well... if that were true, then that means that his efficiency is somewhere over 90% on field goals (he has shot an average of 11.4 FGs per game and has missed an average of and average of 5.3 while grabbing 4.7 offensive boards.   That means that he only misses 0.6 shots a game (by that logic). Of 11 shots?  That means he's scoring over 94% of the time that he's given a shot.   And there is no denying his defensive rebounding skills.   &amp;#x200B;  So if we are talking truly underrated players, I'd have to go with those two."
"If things break right this season, I think we could crack a top 3 seed. I'm not saying it *will* happen, but people are underrating just how beat-up we were last year, and how good we were during the brief periods where our starters were actually getting some run together. Not to mention the fact that we're going to have an *actual bench* this season for the first time since Kyrie left— Josh Richardson and Dennis Schroder may not be stars, but they're *huge* upgrades from Jeff Teague and Grant Williams."
"Rondo helped bring #17 for the Celtics too.  Discount Dennis and the Celtics will win the championship this year and Schroder will emerge as a respectable player, although he is also known for being disagreeable.   His career takes drastic turns after a falling out with the Celtics. Stints with the kings and pelicans, an experiment in Dallas that ends in disaster, all just to end up back in LA as a solid rotation piece that finally learned his role, as Lebron James Jr, THT, and a barely-breathing AD bring another championship banner to Staples Center."

"Agreed. He's going to be desperate to get that money back next summer. If Boston gives him a lot of playing time, he'll probably be fine. But if his minutes are getting restricted because Smart and Pritchard are getting more burn then he could be a very unhappy camper. The Celtics aren't going to be interested in just trying to showcase Schroder for free agency next summer so he can leave, they'll be far more invested in the guys they see as part of their long term future.   If I was Dennis Schroder I'd be praying that extension talks with Smart go poorly and the Celtics look to trade him, opening up an expanded role for Schroder. Otherwise his free agency audition this year may not be quite what he wants. As of right now I see Schroder simply getting another MLE next summer. I'm having a hard time picturing which team with cap space is going to want to use a significant portion of it on him."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Dennis can still make this work out but he seems to be hit very hard by bad luck.  I know people think he is crazy for what he did turning down 84 million but if any of you play poker Schroder was basically sitting doen with a hand like pocket AA. He was in full control the Lakers had no way out other than to pay him because where else were they finding a PG with a high motor \[which LeBron NEEDS at this stage of his career\] who is a playmaker and can be a legit 3rd scoring option for this Lakers in win now mode???  The Lakers did the ONE thing they can do and get an upgrade on Schroder with Westbrook. It was their only move to make and it could not have been foreseen by a reasonable person. He had the Lakers by the balls and played it smart.....but he just got owned it happens. Just like in poker it happens you have pocket AA and somone has pocket 22 and they flop trips and beat you. It's just bad luck. But Dennis played it like a smart businessman yet people are always results oriented.  and now OMG this dude Pritchard look AMAZING for the Celtics!!! Dennis might be having even more bad luck on the way smh. This is shaping up like a travesty he might end up getting only 18-20 mpg if Pritchard continues his sharpshooting and dishing ways. i'm concerned for Dennis as a big fan of him
"We added Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Dennis Schroder to a team that didn't have a bench and was *constantly* injured last year, while losing Fournier (who played sixteen games for us) and Kemba (who played 43 games for us and wasn't very good even when he *did* play). Seriously, I cannot stress how poor our bench was, and how much more our rotation was impacted by injury and COVID— Jeff Teague, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters started a combined **17** games for us."

Wdym? That's Dennis Schroder money
That’s tuff 🔥🔥🔥 - dennis schroder
Dennis Schroder VS a paycheck
Dennis Schroder made a great decision this off season
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De’aron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I’m pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos
The credible source? Dennis Schroder
Literally only known as Russ's rookie dance partner for awhile.  Then just a terrible bust  Now he on that Dennis Schroder money
"Dennis Schroder is a trash ass bum and I don’t care how cheap he was I don’t want him and his bullshit attitude on the Celtics. I don’t even know if that’s unpopular, I just wanted to say it. Ship that bum overseas and let him pretend to be a star over there."
"I genuinely dont think I’m being biased. I am NOT saying THT is better than Dennis right now. I’m saying since THT is 6 years younger, and shows great signs, it’s worth keeping him especially since things weren’t working out with Dennis. I really don’t see the controversy. And it’s not like I’m saying everyone is wrong, I could definitely be wrong. But I don’t understand why sports fans have this idea that their opinion is 100% fact. None of us get paid to do this shit. The lakers front office made a decision but we somehow know more?  Plus I’m not basing this opinion on a magic 8 ball. Again, he’s 6 years younger, his per36 numbers are better than Schoders and his FG% is better. Is it because THT usually doesn’t play against the other teams best squad? Yeah most likely. Schroder goes against the elite PG of the other team, THT doesn’t. Yes. Schroder is better. The lakers already are stacked with experience and talent. Why not keep a young guy to develop in case he turns out to be good in the future? Why is this such a stupid opinion lol."
"The Lakers look just as dumb as Schroder. Pelinka traded DG and a first round pick for Schroder and lost him for nothing. At least find a S&amp;T and get a trade exception.  Also, we don't know that Dennis was actually offered 4|84. There are rumors that isn't actually true."
Ok Dennis Schroder
"I'm the Dennis Schroder of sleeping.   I am certain that I am going to get 8+ hours. Next thing I know, its 3am. Everyone else is asleep. I have come to the realisation that I need to get up in 3 hours. I will just have to settle for whatever I can get tonight and hope to make up for it tomorrow night. But deep down I know that it isn't going to happen."
Dennis “Sprewell” Schroder
"Thankful to OP as this is some extremely new and illuminating commentary that I never would've gotten from the first 100 threads about Schroder during this free agency period. Where a thousand comments have failed, OP has brought the fresh new perspective that Dennis Schroder made a bad financial decision.    Phew, I'm gonna need to take a minute to sit down and really process this."
how the HELL does this guy make more money than Dennis Schroder   come the fuck onnnn
He'll likely never make that money back up. Smh. This is why you need amazing agents and managers who can talk sense into these guys. Dennis Schroder is not an elite PG. Idk why he thought it was a slam dunk he was going to receive $100+ million when he's only shown to be great in 6th man type of roles. I guess he looked at the Brogdon contract as a comparison but Brogdon can defend and hit threes at an elite efficiency.
"I made the original post 35+ min after he posted his, then edited it while he was replying. Thats why there's a 1 minute difference. You guys are weird asf, I don't see the issue.  &gt;thanks for free dennis schroder btw  Yeah, np lol."
"If Jimmy Butler can take the mirror out of his car as a reminder to “never look back”, Dennis Schroder can and should take #84 to remind himself what he gave up by being a selfish twat in a market that didn’t agree.  Sounds like a great chance for character growth to me. Only person he has to blame is himself, so it probably should bear remembering. Of course he won’t, but the symbolism would certainly make sense."
you edited the post kid stop trying to play it off like you didn't now that you got caught  thanks for free dennis schroder btw
Dennis Schroder and I obviously disagree with you
Dennis Schroder.
"With the amount of playing time he’s going to get, technically He’s getting paid more than Dennis Schroder."
Schroder scored 20+ points in 3/6 games and the Lakers won 2 of those games.   What more can anyone ask from their 3rd Scoring option??  Not Dennis fault AD is a street clothes injury prone little bitch  ouchhhhieee my groin got hurt even though no contact!!! i'm 27 years old and more  prone to breaking down than a fat girl on a weak stool lmaoooo
"Dennis ""Baron Corbin"" Schroder"
"Not really, imagine a guy like Dennis Schroder and a guy like Joe Harris, give them both a team to lead where they'll need to score a lot? The Dennis team is gonna be way better, but that's not what is asked of a role player like these two, so Harris gets, and will keep getting big contracts and minutes as long as he is a great 3pt shooter, while Schroder is clearly a better pure scorer, but often he takes the ball away from better players. If he falls in production he's out of the league, just like IT and unlike Joe Harris, or even worse guys, like a Tony Snell"
"I’m not sure that the market spoke. Yes Schroder should have taken that deal, but the timing and circumstances of what happened after wasn’t the marketing shunning him. It was a loss of leverage and timing. By the time the Westbrook deal happened and oldmate Dennis lost his leverage there, the league had already spent most of the available money. Then the Celtics could just offer him the MLE and wait.   Would not surprise me at all to see him in the market and getting $15m + next off season."
Dennis Schroder will water all the 4 leaf clovers in the Boston city area with his tears for a year
"&gt;Schroeder was NEVER that guy  You're right. We need to talk about how Isaiah Thomas was that guy at one point, and he's still not signed with anyone. Celtics Fansided just wrote something about this: https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2021/08/11/dennis-schroder-isaiah-thomas-celtics/"
"Oladipo believe he will get healthy to become a good player, but never go healthy enough to show out. When he did play it wasn't near pre knee injury.  Schroder believe in his hype, but the results compare to his peers is far from the hype. There is enough data for front office to believe there isn't a lot of potential for Dennis Schroder to make big leap to pay him 100mil."
Agreed. For example - Dennis Schroder is now in the news because he only has to accept a $5.9 Million Dollar one year deal with the Celtics instead of the $100Million dollar 4 year deal he wanted.  Dude - $5.9Million is a fuck tonne of money still for a year of playing basketball.  I am glad people like Lillard still realise this.
Dennis Schroder is trending on Twitter Germany 😹
"Does anybody want to talk about why this was the best he could get? We all agree he is worth more. Most free agents get overpaid.  What happened in LA? What List is Dennis Schroder on, and who put him on it?"
Dennis Schroder had no other choice. He still has the chance to fall in a franchise that will play the first roles in the East.  It is up to him to prove that he is worth more than that to a contender.
Dude idk why but I thought it said “ Dennis Schroder has a meltdown at his own youth camp” 😆
"I remember him saying sum like the Celtics were gonna have to bring the Brinks truck for him, then he got traded before he could sign the large contract for the BIG bag, then he got injured &amp; his career fell off.   Understandable how emotional he is. Even worse of a downfall than Dennis Schroder money wise."
"Dunn and Bruno almost certainly getting traded to squeak under tax, no need for Dunn with Dennis now  Smart/Tatum/Brown are definitely starting, Schroder/Pritchard/Grant will be on the bench, but the last two starting positions could go to any of Richardson/Nesmith/Langford/Horford/Timelord and I wouldn't be surprised. I really think Ime isn't gonna solidify the rotation until right before the season starts, it'll probably be an open competition for those last two spots."
"I said Dennis Schroder, and its not even close. Evan Fournier is riding high off of Olympic play right now. And, some people have allowed themselves to think the FIBA Evan = NBA Evan, when it does not work that way for any NBA player. Ever.  Evan Fournier is a nearly-decent offensive scorer in *terms of making the most fundamentals, but  still* ***too unreliable***. His career shows that the more valuable/the more important the games, the less he excels and and the less he transcends his reputation and usual output.  Moreover, Evan's ***defense*** is not effective in a Conf. Finals or NBA Finals type of scenario. *Dennis Schroder is the opposite, on defense, and that alone makes it not even close*.  On offense, I would rank Fournier slightly better than Schroder, by which Schroder has that unique quickness to the basket which Fournier only dreams of.  Schroder's quickness didnt need to be called upon often on offense much, but it always came at key times rrrright when it was needed. That can be big in the playoffs, during the late-rounds when each possession is vital."
"It makes you wonder what kind of advice his agent was giving him. It's one thing for Schroder to think this. His agent should know better.  Only thing I can think, is he kept hearing how much Duncan Robinson was going to get paid and Dennis told himself he should be getting more. But Dennis has always had an inflated sense of self"

"As is tradition.   Although I maintained from the beginning that 4 years/84 was a massive fucking overpay. I hated the “they have no cap space so they have no choice” bullshit. Uhhh, yes they do? Dennis Schroder isn’t that fucking good."
Yeah he looks barely taller than CP3 and considerably shorter than Westbrook. I'd call him 6'1  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/steven-adams-dennis-schroder-chris-paul-head-coach-billy-donovan-picture-id1172916483 https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/dennis-schroder-and-russell-westbrook-of-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-picture-id1040228242?s=2048x2048
"&gt; So your alternative is that LeBron already talked to Russell.   lmao have you heard of reading comprehension? that was a simple hypothetical example of one of 17,994,875 things that could have happened in the 4 months between dennis refusing the contract and now  i even qualified that statement and i thought i was pretty clear it was unlikely, but you seem like you're not very bright if THAT is what you're latching onto while ignoring the simple reality of: *the lakers just didn't want to sign schroder*. plus why would the wizards agree to anything with schroder on an overpay? i'm pretty sure the lakers sent out matching salary just fine lol  anyway, trying to discuss anything with people like you is pointless because you clearly have trouble understanding what you read and are just making up nonsense while completely ignoring me at this point. bye"
"Sucks for Dennis Schroder.  But he believed in himself,  gambled on himself, and lost. It happens a lot like with Demarcus Cousins and John Collins. Cousins  unfortunately got injured. Collins turned down a $90m contract before the season started and after a good season he signed a $125 m contract."
doris sucking off dennis schroder rn
"Thing is, Dennis is probably worth more than this contract. I really like what the Celtics have done, and I think they've got an upgrade over injury prone Kemba from last season.  Championship worthy? No, probably not, but Schroder gets under the skin. I'd almost like this guy if he wasnt a huge idiot and an anti vaxxer.  Bargain at 6 mil imo. Let's see what he can do with everything to prove"
Dennis Schroder has grossed $75M USD in career earnings.  95% of the users on this sub haven't grossed even $1M in career earnings.  He ain't losing sleep over getting 'roasted' by people on this sub lol
"I personally disagree. Defensively Schroder is clearly better, as Graham is undersized.   Playmaking wise they are about equivalent.   Offensively, Graham is a better 3 point  shooter but he is limited to that. He has terrible touch around the basket and does not drive at all (hence why his 2 pt % is literally under 40)   Btw Dennis is 27, Graham is 26, so there’s not really much development gap there."
"$5.9M is a steal for someone like Schroder, memes aside. W for the Celtics but big L for Dennis. Playing next to Tatum, Smart, and Brown should be good enough to raise his stock back to the $10-$15M p/y range next off-season. Still can't believe he turned down the Lakers offer though."
"I said it before and I'll say it again: fuck Dennis Schroder.  I hope he sucks it up in Boston.   Oh yeah, and fuck the Celtics."
"Dennis - Fuck no to $80+M for four years from Lakers. I am worth more.  Agent - ""No one wants you except Boston.""  Boston - $5.9M for a year.  Dennis - Fuck no I am worth more. Give me $9.5M and an additional year for $9.5M.  Boston probably - ""Opps, you're Dennis Schroder? We were looking for Dennis Schomther."" Or $4M and second-year team option.  If a team gives me $80+M contract, I am signing it that day. Since max extensions for superstars goes for around $50M/year, maybe he thought he could get $150M for five years. WTF, he would have only gotten $7/year of 4 years for total of $28M just ten years ago.  Life time money times 10 wasn't good enough. Windfall from Lakers was a mega jack pot. SMH."
"After the playoffs, I wrote a damn essay about what it was like to watch Dennis during this one season as a Laker, and this actually leaves out a few other idiotic things he did.    In case anybody has a few hours to kill, here is still an overview of his career in purple and gold:   Dennis strolled into training camp and repeatedly told every press member that he would absolutely not be a bench player in LA. He tried being a bench player earlier, and he won't do it again. Vogel publicly that decision had not been made, but Dennis would not shut-up about it. Dennis also never seemed to miss a chance to be a distraction, and a lot of the info that he freely gave the press was supposed to be confidential.     These are simply off the top of my head:     Coming off the bench if it helps the team? Not a chance.   Vaccines? He's skeptical.   Following covid guidelines? Absolutely not. Seems to attempt to break them all on his official YouTube channel like he's going for an all time record (having somebody record him at amusements parks, toy stores, restaurants, etc., without a mask)   Being quarantined? It's torture being catered to, and playing video games, in a mansion.   Now will he follow covid guidelines? Hell no.   LeBron? Not vaccinated.   His other teammates? Vaccinated.   Missed games again due to covid, forcing his teammates to play while hurt, which made their injuries worse just in time for the playoffs? Whines about being quarantined again. He can't handle it. Poor him. Why is his life is so hard?    Changing his social media profiles? He is a Laker. He is not a Laker. Now, he's a Laker again. The day of an elimination playoff game is a perfect time for these distractions. Right after the they were eliminated, he is no longer a Laker again (at least they got that part right).    4/84 million to stay a Laker? Went straight to the press to say that their offer was way too low. Completely unfair to him. He needed an offer of 100-120 million minimum.      You'd think that the Dennis would at least not be online gaming while the Lakers were playing an important game. Then, during one of the times Dennis took his covid protocol vacations, he actually decided that was a good idea. He didn't even pretend to care about his team or teammates. It was again obvious that most of the fans cared way more about that game than he did, and we care for free.     So, after the second playoff loss, Dennis unsurprisingly said that he had decided that he would not be looking at any video of that game, which goes against everything that Vogel teaches. Dennis has plenty of time to play video games, but not enough time to watch clips of a game that he wanted 100+ million dollars to play.   As a Laker fan, I'm still in denial that Caruso will not be a Laker this upcoming season, and for the first time ever I will be following another team, because Caruso is so damn likable. The fact, though, that ultimate team player Caruso fielded several offers before signing a 4/37,000,000 with the Bulls, while Dennis ""4/84 million is insulting"" Schroder had to take a 1/ 5.9 million with the Celtics, does make me smile. Dennis had an offer worth way more than twice of what Caruso took, but when it comes to attitude and work ethic, he is the anti-Caruso.   84/4 million to 5.9/1 million. That's tough. Yes, I refuse to even use his stupid catchphrase ""correctly"" when posting."
I'm feeling pretty good about the re-tooling this summer  - +Al Horford – Tristan Thompson  - +Josh Richardson – Evan Fournier  - +Kris Dunn – Kemba Walker  - +Dennis Schroder
"Based on what evidence? We see time and again NBA players overrating themselves and their talent/game shape, due to ego. From Ricky Davis, Dion Waiters, Melo, Russ, all the way to Dennis Schroder, it’s a tale as old as the NBA. What is it about Love that you are convinced he lied? Why does there have to be some conspiracy and someone that you HAVE to criticize? Why can’t it be as simple as: team and player thought it would work out, but it didn’t and they moved on."
Brah Dennis Schroder said last season he was the only one who wasn’t vaccinated
"AD went from Dennis ""throwing one lob"" Schroder to multi-time assisting champions."
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"
&gt; Dennis Schroder never wears the same outfit twice  no way
"Dennis Schroder never wears the same outfit twice. Combine it with brands like Versace, Gucci etc and it's pretty easy to burn even more."
"Personally, I wouldn't put us as high as this person did. That being said, there is a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the Celtics season.  1. Replacing 6 games of Fournier for a season of Josh Richardson is actually an upgrade  2. Replacing half a season of Theis with a full season of Horford is also an upgrade  3. Replacing half a season of Kemba at 70% of himself with a highly motivated Dennis Schroder is at least a huge upgrade on defense, if we do take a step back offensively   4. The depth this year is waaaaaaaaay better than it has been in the past, with Schroder and likely Horford coming off the bench  5. Most of the changes we made are on the defensive side of the ball and there's a chance we could see a return to a top 5 defense  I think the Heat and Hawks are ahead of us, but I'm still pretty optimistic about how things will go."
"while i believe this is true in general, there are plenty of reasons to dislike Dennis Schroder beyond just being a hater"
Dennis Schroder is the man who potentially knows his value but Boston Celtics doesn't know and offered him $5.8M and he accepted it😂😂😂
"""You know I had to do it one time""  -Dennis ""Danny Green"" Schroder"
Dennis Schroder and Victor Oladipo are punching air right now.
"Dennis Schroder, Draymond Green, Solomon Hill, PJ Tucker, Jae Crowder if Schroder and Hill were on the Warriors and Jae Crowder was still on the Heat"
I feel bad for Dennis Schroder
Dennis Schroder
Only Dennis Schroder will do that
Dennis Schroder
of all the apps im not going to download  the dennis schroder fan app is very close to the top
Dennis Schroder
And now he's gone altogether and replaced with an also pretty cooked Horford. And Dennis Schroder. And Brad Stevens isn't coaching.  I definitely think Toronto could be better than Boston but I also don't think that's saying much.
"MVP: Jayson Tatum (yeah you probably think I’m crazy but I saw multiple guys say Trae young so this seems justified)   MIP: Jordan Poole  6moty: Dennis Schroder, I mean a lot of people have been shitting on him and just acting like he is a bad player so I think he’s gonna try and prove everyone wrong  DPOY: as much as I hate him Ben Simmons   ROTY; Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green"
"MVP: James Harden, Nets will steamroll the NBA and Harden's stats will look better than KD's  DPOY: Joel Embiid, with Simmons gone and the Sixers will still have a great defense, but with one less person to split the votes  MIP: OG Anunoby, idk, i saw someone else say him and it sounded good  ROY: Cade Cunningham, i think there will be a lot of candidates, but there's like only one other offensive option on the Pistons  6MOY: Dennis Schroder, dude will be on a mission to get paid and the C's will rely on him A LOT. I think he will be incredibly productive coming off the bench with Horford in the PnR/PnP"
Devin Booker scoring a buzzer beater on Dennis Schroder and then on insta’s ESPN highlight commenting “That’s Tuff 🔥💯” shit was hilarious 🤣
"If the Lakers brought back Dennis Schroder, who has been retired since 2021, he would be the 6th youngest player on the roster as it currently stands."
"In interesting news Dennis Schroder has declined Brooklyns offer of 47 million for an apparence at a local basketball camp. In the interview, he said he was going to bet on himself"
Its a little late now but philly should of traded simmons to portland for CJ and change and signed dennis schroder
"I just think the lack of self-awareness is funny.  I didn't realize celtics fans actually think they are on some big upswing.  You went from all these picks to having Kyrie, Hayward, and Horford...then to Kemba and Hayward, then to just Kemba with the Jays, and now you got Dennis Schroder and Josh Richardson and old Horford. Two guys whose former teams celebrated having gone lol.  All the while the East got better"
"Lol last year you were garbage, you can be better and still be a 1st or 2nd round exit(which you will be at best).  And you somehow got a lot better going from kemba walker to Dennis schroder and al horford? lollll  And the Sixers not being better this next year doesn't mean they have peaked, hard concept for you to grasp apparently.  You got worse last year, does that mean you peaked? No?  See how that works?"
"Yup. Hell, we thought Dennis Schroder was going to be good because of one good season playing with Chris Paul. Then he just reverted to the mean."
dennis schroder or enes kanter
Morey is turning into Dennis Schroder of GMs
Dennis Schroder isn't a star... And he doesn't have the reputation of being overly consistent.
"i understand what you’re saying. the fact is that even if lebron demanded the ball, dennis isn’t good for much else. it’s either keep him in the game and ultimately watch him score 0 points while being unengaged on offense or demand the ball and watch dennis do even more nothing. he also doesn’t shoot a lot of threes so his value is absolute balls if lebron playmakes. while i dislike schroder, it’s still necessary to keep him in the game as PG because he is simply better than the other options at guard at the moment in game 5. but i do get what you’re saying though, just bummed it didn’t work out ultimately"
This dude had his worst season since his rookie year but he wanna talk about Dennis Schroder frustrating him
"paul george, chris paul, carmelo, oladipo, dennis schroder. there’s probably something better but I can’t think of it"
It’s hilarious that this guy thinks he has any leverage in this situation. Nobody wants him except as a limited-use starter or a role player. People think Dennis Schroder was out of touch. Holy shit.
"I feel like this one's pretty obviously Robert Williams, but Aaron Nesmith might also be up there— if he can take a big leap this year, he's a *way* better fit next to our other starters than Josh Richardson or Dennis Schroder just because of the spacing he provides. He's got legit 3&amp;D potential."
Dennis Schroder
Dennis Schroder  At least clowned himself
Agree the dude Dennis Schroder himself and has no one to blame but himself.
Or Dennis Schroder does something dumb whichever comes first?
"I'm not calling anyone anything, I never spoke to him. I am however referencing this which was going around pretty frequently before the trade -   https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/11/11/21561003/nba-trade-rumors-dennis-schroder-lakers-clippers"

All thanks to Dennis Schroder LOL   He should win the MVP this coming season if the Lakers end up winning the Championship!
"Sixers tanked Simmons’s value even more by insulting him after the semis. Yes, he stank, but what really hurts a player’s value is if they’re seen as uncooperative. Dennis Schroder is a prime example. I’m glad no team fell for it and he had to take a cheap contract.   Daryl Morey needs to draw a line in the sand: do you wanna keep Simmons, or get rid of him? Simple as that. He won’t get fleeced. This is about him wanting a blockbuster deal when it’s just not playing out that way right now."
"There were reports Dennis was demanding a starting spot. When we signed him this report came out:  &gt;[Per a source: Dennis Schroder signed with Boston with no expectation of a starting role. Celtics made it clear that Ime Udoka will evaluate roles and minutes. Also, this will be Udoka's decision only. The front office, led by Brad Stevens, will not get involved in PT decisions.](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1425235421118832645)   As u/SquimJim said, it's pretty much all but confirmed Smart is our starting PG and he'll be our lead facilitator. Not only have they spoken about him having the ball more, there's also been a lot of talk about this being his first year where he doesn't have to play backup or SG for an all-star PG.  Brad and Ime have also been very complimentary of Richardson and I would guess he's the favourite to take the starting 2 spot."
I thought the whole Dennis Schroder fiasco kind of killed off the Noel memes already?
"It really makes you wonder why Rich Paul specifically gets so much shit. I mean, how many people here have ever even heard of the agents of Dennis Schroder or Victor Oladipo? Didn't those guys also turn down huge money and lose out? I've never seen people saying they should sue their agents, instead people say that *they*, not their agents, screwed up.   Why is Nerlens Noel suddenly absolved of his part in that decision and it's all on Rich Paul? You'll note that Noel's former agent doesn't say ""Rich Paul passed"" he says *Nerlens* did. And why is it that everyone knows with apparently intimidate detail every deal Rich Paul has been a part of? Is it cause he's black? Is it because he's associated with LeBron? Both? Why is this such a big story around here for so many people? I can't help but feel like there is some extra subtext that everyone here is tiptoing around."
I wonder if dennis schroder also going to sue his agent for losing 60mil  Or was that his decision?  Noel probably don’t make decisions himself
"First of all, LeBron was not on the Lakers when KCP signed with them, and he most definitely didn't turn down that contract with Detroit specifically so he sign with the Lakers. He turned down their offer thinking they would up the offer (or get a bigger offer from someone else), but instead the Pistons traded for Avery Bradley, which used up the cap space they had with which to offer KCP anything. This left KCP kinda out in the cold as most teams had used their cap space already.   The only team that really had any space left was the Lakers, and that was because they had only been willing to offer players a 1 year deal because they were targeting the following summer and wanted to keep their cap space open. As a result they'd missed on previous targets (i.e. George Hill). KCP being desperate took a 1 year deal that paid him $18 million to play for the Lakers. Then he took a $12 million deal. Then an $8 million deal, then he signed that $39 million deal that he's currently on. So he turned down that $80 million contract but has since made (or is still owed) $75 million and he won a ring. I doubt he has any regrets.   As for Trez, it's absurd to say he took less money just cause Rich Paul wanted him on the Lakers, like Trez had no say in the matter. We don't know what the other offers for him were, but he probably felt they weren't that great so he decided to try to chase a ring for a year and hit free agency again. It's not that uncommon.  Why is it that people think that either LeBron or Rich Paul have this ability to make players sign where they don't want to for less money? When Dennis Schroder passed on his extension with the Lakers, I didn't see anyone blaming his agent, they all felt like that was his choice. Why is it just Rich Paul that gets judged like this?"
"It's unfortunate but that's a big part of where the hate for Rich Paul comes from. Not from everyone, of course. Some people hate him cause they just hate LeBron and everything associated with him, but it's upsetting how much everyone focuses on this one agent like this. I think it's interesting that we haven't seen anyone talking about the agents for Dennis Schroder or Victor Oladipo, but people have been talking about Rich Paul and Noel for years before this. With Dennis Schroder, it seems like most people feel like Schroder made a big mistake, but with Noel everyone seems to think Rich Paul is responsible. Can't help but wonder why."
He did the double Dennis Schroder
"&gt;Bro your stanning hard for Richard.  Not at all. I'm just saying there's two sides to every story and I'm not impulsive enough to simply take one person's word for it. I want to wait to see how Paul responds and how this lawsuit goes. If they rule against him then I'll believe that. But it takes more than an allegation by someone looking to profit off a lawsuit to make up my mind for me.   &gt;It was pretty obvious in real time rich fucked up  Don't you mean it was obvious that Noel fucked up? I think it's interesting that when Dennis Schroder turned down $84 million from the Lakers everyone said that Dennis fucked up, but when Noel turned down $70 million from the Mavs that was on Rich Paul. Why is that?"
"Why do you have to care about either of them? My whole point is that it's silly that people really have much of an opinion about agents at all when none of us knows what the conversations are like between agents and players. Having a strong opinion either way is silly. [Rich Paul has made a lot of money for some of his clients](https://hoopshype.com/reps/rich-paul/) and he's whiffed on others. That's the same as any agent. The same guy who reps Steph and Giannis reps Dennis Schroder, but the vast majority of people here [couldn't tell you his name,](https://hoopshype.com/reps/jeff-austin/) and it's probably because they feel like they don't know enough to care. My suspicion is the Rich Paul hate is mostly about just hating LeBron, but people try to pretend it's about Rich Paul."
"And this is why people hate on an agent: really it's just an extension of their hatred for LeBron. After all, you don't see people hating on Jeff Austin and Alex Saratsis. Most people here have probably never even heard of them, but those are the guys who represent Dennis Schroder. People blame Schroder for costing himself $78 million, but they blame Rich Paul for Noel missing out on $58 million. This is why: it's cause the person they actually hate is LeBron."
Dennis Schroder is intrigued
"Don’t be the next Dennis Schroder, Mitchell."
"This was my point in that above comment. In what world do you think the Celtics are trading Jaylen Brown and Dennis Schroder for Ben Simmons? There's absolutely zero chance that happens, or the Raptors send Siakam there for Simmons, or the Nuggets send Murray there for Simmons. Simmons has low trade value right now, Philly can't just flip him for players like that. TBH I doubt they could get Brogdon and LeVert for him either. You're acting like Simmons will get you some great return but that's just not the reality right now, and that's why I think there's reason to be concerned for the Sixers."

"Im not annoyed at all, if any teams rookie popped off like that against a solid playoff team like the celtics they would be flipping out  He looked honestly amazing, though part of it was dennis schroder being a turnstile on defense"
"A big knock on Brad Stevens (whom many regarded as a good coach) early in his tenure was the lineups he put out were questionable. People freaking out over Udoka after 2 games need to settle down as things like schemes take time to implement with guys who were so used to Stevens’ system (Tatum, Brown and Smart specifically). Yeah we were getting killed on the boards and turning the ball over too much, it’s gotta be fixed. Could have used Kanter for a bit there instead of Grant at the 5 in the 3Q even if his defense is abysmal, and Tatum/Brown never seem to have good games at the same time. I think it’s reasonable to question their fit if this continues through this year.  In any case, I’m not sure why the expectations were so high when all the Bradley Beal to the Celtics rumors months ago fell through and we ended up with Dennis Schroder, Josh Richardson, Al Horford and Enes Kanter, but otherwise the EXACT same team and people thought these guys would move the needle to push them to the 3 seed? It was always going to be a non-contending year and they 100% have to land a guy next off season or you can start to blame the FO for not getting the personnel they need to contend.  Sorry, but a bunch of guys who are basically 6th men/bench guys hasn’t changed that. It’s going to be another rough year for Celtics fans I think."
"I mean, it doesn't really make sense. Looking at the roster and the team as a whole they should be good, lots of continuity on the roster and a lot of skilled players up and down the roster. I think Dennis Schroder was a horrible pick up though."

Dennis Schroder looks like an iguana
"&gt; What was their alternative? Pay Dennis Schroder? Run it back with KCP and Kuz?   I mean, yeah?"
"KCP got a lot of blame during the beginning of the 2020 season. Since then and especially after we won I saw nothing but support for KCP from Lakers fans. He absolutely earned his respect.  Kuzma also got shit on before but again after he improved his defense, rebounding and cutting in 2020 and his shooting in 2021 it was mostly fans of opposing teams that shit on him. He got clowned during the playoff sure but that was justified because he played like shit.  The person you're thinking of is Dennis Schroder. He was and still is getting shit on by Lakers fans hardcore. Zero argument there.   As for the 2nd half of your comment I don't necessarily disagree. Westbrook is dogshit lmao. It was fun watching/forcing your team to crash and burn and watching Harden call it quits though after bitching them in 5 during the playoffs and then blowing them out in back to back games during the season."
"What was their alternative? Pay Dennis Schroder? Run it back with KCP and Kuz?   They didn't exactly have a lot of options..   It's the Lakers and they have LeBron, I don't think they really care what his salary his. They think he'll be an improvement over Schroder."
"For real.  Last year, the Lakers FO dodged a bullet by not signing Dennis Schroder to a new contract worth $21 million/year.  So to celebrate, they go out and trade for Westbrook, who's making $44 million this year (and $47 million next year).  So yeah ... shit got worse"

Dennis Schroder: “Bro…”
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."
&gt;	Dennis Schroder had an underwhelming preseason  Uhh… I don’t agree with that at all. He only played in two preseason games and looked pretty good in the first game and genuinely great in the second one.   I’m not sure if his game one performance shows up in the box score because he didn’t shoot well and a lot of his passes resulted in missed wide open shots. But the ball movement during his time running the paint was so much improved from the previous season.
damn it you missed dennis schroder
"He's been bad his whole career... Last year he was ""meh"" and that's been his peak. He's had a negative DBPM every year (came in at 113 last year). His DWS peak was last year at 2.7... thats good! But not a lock down defender. That 2.7 rating puts him behind Dennis Schroder and I don't think any of us think he's a lockdown defender."

"3/3/1 IMO.   &gt; 1) They don't need Russ to have LeBron and AD rest. They should comfortably make the playoffs with LeBron and AD playing fewer minutes in the alternative universe of having KCP, Buddy Hield, Caruso and Dennis instead of Russ.  Actually I hard disagree on this... because that's a lineup that they couldn't have actually.   First of all KCP and Buddy would not exist together on the team seeing how the originally agreed trade was / salary match considerations. In this alternate universe how does the Lakers keep KCP in the trade and somehow bring in Hield?   Let me know because that means we can also have Buddy on that team right now with WB already there, seeing how KCP + Kuzma + Trez was what it took to get WB.   They don't NEED WB for LeBron to rest. but having WB ALLOWS LeBron to rest.   &gt;2) AD should expand his offensive role if LeBron wants less of one instead of bringing in the highest usage player in the NBA who essentially does nothing when he doesn't have the ball.  I literally mentioned this in my previous comments... but how exactly do you want this to happen? Is bringing in a point guard that can feed you easy looks not exactly how AD will have bigger role?  When LeBron isn't playing, isn't WB bringing up the ball in his hands and feeding AD a bad thing?   Why is having high usage rate a bad thing, if the Lakers want WB to handle the ball then feed AD?  This man somehow leads the league in assist with subpar players on his team, you don't think WB will be able to find one of the best pick and roll man for easy buckets?     &gt;5) If you are a contender you should build your team with an eye to the playoffs, not the regular season.  For most teams, yes. For a team with aging star as the focal point, the #1 point should be 'how do we get him to the playoffs healthy' first.    &amp;nbsp;  Now for the valid concerns -   &gt;3) LeBron and AD far from chilling are going to have to work harder on defence because they got rid of all their 2-way players for Russ.   KCP is really the only true 2-way player. Trez was garbage on defence. Caruso was ass on offence. Kuzma was not good at either. Gasol was garbage on defence.   But your point here is valid. They'll need to play harder defence.  &gt;6) The Laker's half-court offence has been dog shit.   Yeap, their half court is ass.   but ""One of the biggest hurdles to the Lakers winning a title is having a good enough half-court offence"" is an iffy statement. The biggest hurdle is having LeBron and AD healthy. You're looking at a 2 year sample and saying 'outside of bubble' which is funny.    Lakers ran a 2-man game with LeBron and AD in half court sets just fine in 2021 regular season until they both were injured.    &gt;7) Russ/AD and LeBron won't work together IMO which is really the only thing that will matter in June.  yeap, the fit is questionable.   &amp;nbsp;    Now for the subjective one  &gt;4) It's not a given that Russ minutes without LeBron will be any good. I think those minutes will still suck.  They'll suck. But would it be worse than 2021 Lakers for example with Schroder on the floor without LeBron? Just look at the stretches when LeBron wasn't there in 2021, they were worse than the Wizards during that stretch."
"Yeah, he can. But he’s one of the ten best point guards in NBA history, so he’s more likely to not do that. Also, Dennis Schroder can do the exact same thing, but he doesn’t do anything as well as Westbrook does other than shooting. So it’s still a massive upgrade."
"i was thinking about lebron and the lakers and it's kind of funny that he's had both dennis schroder and kyrie irving as his PGs in the past.  (he also banished wiggs to minnesota when he chose to go back to cleveland, but that's not a real connection, i guess.  and wiggs apparently isn't anti-vax so much as he is anti putting anything in his body he doesn't see as natural?)"
Dennis Schroder
They only really need something like 18/7/5 from Westbrook to be the top contenders in the league. He'll bounce back for sure. He's essentially filling the gap that Dennis Schroder was not able to last season.
"PSA: Malik Monk isn't much better than Dennis Schroder, if at all. Someone notify the Lakers TV guys of this information."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
dennis schroder
2020 Dennis Schroder agrees
"Fans always have hindsight.   Players know that they potentially stand to lose millions either way.   Oladipo is a helluva player.   Dennis Schroder is a helluva player.   Oladipa got an injury, and Schroder ended up playing on a team playing musical chairs through the regular season and then got his with COVID going into the playoffs, and despite the fact the Lakers lost because AD was out, people acted like they lost because of Schroder had a bad game (Kuz and KCP both had at least one zero-point game too, but nobody was shitting on them).   &amp;#x200B;  They bet on themselves, and I respect that.   It's not like, in hindsight, people are shitting on Curry for taking less than he was worth when he was coming back from injury because he didn't bet on himself and lost tens of millions of dollars in the process.   It goes both ways."
"[Yep, this was just 10 months ago:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)  &gt; ""I did this off-the-bench stuff already in two years with OKC,"" Schroder, who finished second behind teammate Montrezl Harrell for Sixth Man of the Year for his role with the Thunder, said on an introductory videoconference call with reporters Monday. ""I think I try to move forward, and I think with [Anthony Davis] and LeBron, I can be helpful as a starter in the PG position.""  &gt; Schroder said that he has not spoken to Lakers coach Frank Vogel about his desire to start, however his representatives, Alex Saratsis and Jeff Austin of Octagon, discussed that aspect with the Lakers front office prior to L.A.'s trading guard Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in the draft to the Thunder to complete the deal.  &gt; ""I think my agent talked to the organization before they was trading me,"" he said ""So, that's that.""  I guess the selfish approach didn't work towards getting himself paid so now he's willing to try being a team player and see if that works."

"See this is the problem when it comes to Lebron. Would you discredit ALL of Yao Ming’s blocks because they came against smaller players? Would you discredit a guy like Giannis getting a clutch block on someone like Jokic just because he’s more athletic? Would discredit Pierce’s game saving block on Lowry just because it was rather simple? No, you wouldnt. The only player that HAS to block someone while being at a disadvantage is Lebron. THATS the standard yall judge him by.   He got a clutch defensive play to win the game. So what if it was on Dennis Schroder? So what if it’s on Jeff Teague? So what? Does that mean it isn’t clutch? If it was so easy then why aren’t players like Giannis getting all these clutch blocks in pivotal games in a 4 year stretch? Not every play has to be some sort of superhuman effort to be considered clutch.    This is by far the worst argument to discredit a player, and immature as hell."

We have to look past some of his failures to get a more accurate representation of who Dennis Schroder is as a player
Allow me to introduce to you: rookie Dennis Schroder.   https://youtu.be/cy7g-ljIgdQ

84 million dollars: I don't think I fit in with Dennis Schroder
"The only negative thing?  Lmaooooooooo  He’s a clown, an idiot as bad as Kyrie Irving, except much worse, because at least Kyrie helps his team on the court. Dennis Schroder was a minus player all year long and made a championship offense irrelevant with poor decision making and selfish play."
Dennis Schroder is an incredibly overrated basketball player on the court.   Happy?
ergahzidioasdklfj;sd;fk - Dennis schroder.
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
"And even worse, Dennis Schroder is still only making 5.9 million."
"I’ve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He’s totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn’t enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It’s harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he’s just not really quick. He’ll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he’s not automatic like Durant so he’s inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he’s on, sometimes he’s off.  So I think it’s a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it’s easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there’s no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It’s when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he’s good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."
"Potential Lineups:  Toronto – Fred VanVleet, Svi Mykhailiuk, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa  Boston – Dennis Schroder, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford  Not very promising for us"
"POBO Brad built a defense-focused team in the most prolific offensive era in the history of the game. They basically just banked on the Jays scoring ~30 each every night and figured everyone else could throw in whatever bullshit came their way, and shut everyone down on defense to make up for it. But the Jays almost never have great games on the same night, and more importantly one of them is always out of the lineup, so we are left depending on Marcus Smart, Dennis Schroder, Al Horford and Josh Richardson to make up for it, which they can't do.   On top of that, Tatum has really bought in to his own hype, and gives the defense the absolute easiest task of just standing around and watching him Iso into a sidestep 3 as his main scoring preference. He has had a couple of games when he has made a clear effort to not do that, and he has looked unstoppable, and his rebounding and passing have both improved dramatically this year, but he just can't get past defaulting to playground ball, and the worst part is that we don't really have the roster to prove to him that he can defer sometimes to make the defense think and work a bit.   Basically, our team sucks in both roster construction and execution."
"I don't think this was an unpopular opinion, but I said that the Celtics getting Dennis Schroder for $5.9 mil is highway robbery. So far, he's been worth at least 3 times that value."
"The odd calendar of the covid season really screws with my sense of recall, sorry.  What I recalled was that Schroeder could have been offered that as [early as Feb.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-dennis-schroder-declined-the-lakers-contract-extension-offer-and-when-he-can-get-a-fair-deal/). But the news was only broken in March.  Still you may be right that the offer was about the same time, or likely before the trade deadline/lowry rumor.  [At the time,](https://lakeshowlife.com/2021/05/12/los-angeles-lakers-right-not-trade-kyle-lowry/) , Schroeder had not yet laid that egg in the playoffs or revealed his demand for 100-120 mn.  Critically the Lakers[ still had hopes](https://lakeshowlife.com/2021/05/12/los-angeles-lakers-right-not-trade-kyle-lowry/) for the season/postseason and the loss of wing depth and bench was a critical factor.  The offseason decision to lose all that depth to chase WB was in a slightly different context than the trade deadline. it doesn't mean the decision to trade for WB was good, or that there was foreknowledge at the time of trade deadline ..."
Ain’t going to go find them all but do you not remember this dirty ass play?   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6qgjVPErn2M  Watch the slomo. Still don’t get how he didn’t even get a foul for this. Absolutely zero reason to grab him in the air and pull  He has multiple others like the Dennis Schroder one too
Dennis Schroder history week lol
Hell if he gets his team out of the first round I'll be surprised. Dennis Schroder was blowing by him with ease last night.

"Russell Westbrook has proven to be worst than Schroder.  A lot of people this summer said that Russ just needed to be a better version of Dennis. Reality is, as I said so many times, that Russ is bad right now (and was bad last 3 seasons) by pure basketball skills standards he is way under NBA average pointguard (where I consider DS to be just average).   Last season he ""carried"" a team because the conference started to suck because of injuries of others and teams resting players for the playoffs. Moreover Russ played so many possessions that his numbers couldn't be more pumped... but in reality he was below league average for production per possession, and this is the case from 2018 now.  Russ was a statpadder at best, now people are realising, watching him more, that he is also bad at the whole basketball thing."
Dennis Schroder helping push his former team below .500? That’s unironically Tuff 🔥💯
"Dennis Schroder 1 LA Lakers 0   21pts, 6 rebs and 6 ast    Also, the Lakers are paying Westbrook 7 times what Boston is paying Schroder"

Dennis Schroder is pretty quick.
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"The package also included Dennis Schroder, KCP, and a first round pick. Including a promising young player like THT would’ve been an insane amount of assets for a 35 year old on the last year of his contract.   Lowry was gonna be a unrestricted free agent, and was looking for the biggest payday possible (which he got this summer from the Heat, 3 years/85 million).   THT has value to to the Lakers. He’s either the best best trade bait the team has to acquire talent, or if he develops well, he could become part of their post-LeBron Lakers future."
Dennis Schroder got covid like 2 weeks before the playoffs… what a weak ass excuse lmao

"Theres a 19 mil difference between what Hield and Westbrook are making, so if they could have signed a facilitator with that money, then yes. The issue is; who is the playmaking facilitator making roughly 19m/year?   I pulled up  the list of Point Guards on espn, and none really meet those qualifications. Everyone is either on a rookie deal, has a larger salary, or doesnt facilitate well. The only players would be like, Dragic or Kemba, who both have injury concerns.   Or Lakers legend Dennis Schroder"
Dennis Schroder shot well from three his last year in OKC and thus will continue to do so on the Lakers even though he shot poorly every other year of his career.  Pain.
Dennis Schroder for $45m/year
"You might be right spacing is very important but they can go dennis, smart, richardson, tatum and horford that spacing isnt bad and has switchability on defense. This could be a good time for not only tatum, but also schroder, and smart to break out of there slump so if anything thats the positive to this. To be fair hes been settling for a lot of jumpers so far if he can add the playmaking to his game that would help but hes not a good passer. We'll see what happens but I expect at least one of those 3 to break out of there funk."

"What Smart saying is the Jay’s (especially Tatum) need to pass the ball so other can get them easy points. Everybody know Tatum/Brown are the only scorers on that team.

For how much shit he get Schroder is actually the one on the team who work well with the Jay’s and Horford. Dennis should be starting, but he is the one on the bench who can score."

"The Celtics need to empower Dennis Schroder. He’s on a bargain contract, the expect value of his play could return exponential gains…"
I’m honestly not sure why everyone was so high on them. They lost Kemba/Fournier and replaced them with Dennis Schroder and an older Horford. The east is just stacked now and their roster doesn’t compare
"Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and ........ Dennis Schroder???"
&gt; Dennis Schroder too but that's just because he'll get too big of a contract in the offseason  Just like this year?
Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson will not be on this team next season. Dennis Schroder too but that's just because he'll get too big of a contract in the offseason

My expectations were kinda high this year. I was expecting Jaylen Brown to make a huge leap this year which he has in some areas. I was hoping Dennis Schroder would go on a tear to show he is worth that contract he wanted. We just haven't lived up to that hyper yet but not all my hope is lost
"Lol  I guess you missed all the memes about Brad trying to figure out how his phone worked. No worries, they bagged Dennis Schroder in the end."
Dennis Schroder with a spinorama lmfao
"need dennis schroder to be better than 0-3 FG, 3pts. isn't he looking for a big contract"
Dennis Schroder is definitely a $2 million/yr player
Defensive anchor Dennis schroder
"Why would you take a vacay by doing something 10 times more physically punishing for a 10th of the pay?    NFL players get paid pocket change compared to NBA players.  For example: George Kittle, when he signed his extension, was coming off an all-time great season and was on his way to being one of the greatest tight ends ever.  His contract, which was highly controversial for being arguably an overpay because it was a record setting tight end extension at the time, was for 15 million a year.    Dennis Schroder, a man best known for commenting “That’s Tuff 💯🔥” on a memorial post for his teammate’s grandmother, was offered a 4 year contract for 21 million."
lol Dennis the fraud Schroder said fuck the Lakers
Dennis Schroder is a black hole in everything for the Lakers
"Ah yes, well known white NBA player Dennis Schroder"
"For his entire career, the winning formula with lebron is surround him with good perimeter shooters. Who do the lakers get? Fucking drummond, harrell and dennis hot trash schroder. Smh"
All my homies hate Dennis Schroder
Tom Brady dont have to play with Dennis Schroder.
you know normally id be disappointed bc I wanna see a good game but damn....if it aint satisfying watching some young up and comers royally dismantle The reigning champs like this. see ya bron. also Dennis Schroder is coming close to dethroning playoff p as #1 playoff embarrassment with his performances.
Dennis Schroder is playing awful basketball rn

Do you guys want Dennis Schroder?

yo holy shit I went to your profile to see if I could discern where in Europe you're from and saw the post about the heat possibly pursuing schroder and I have to apologize. I hope y'all don't. Y'all are so guard heavy already and there is 0 chance that he would thrive on your guys team. love the heat the slander after this sweep is ridiculous y'all will be 4-6 seed without a doubt next year but I will pray nightly that you don't get cursed with my mans dennis.   Fr tho sorry if I offended you amigo it's all love I try to contribute genuine posts here 80% of the time and then just go dummy fool mode the other 20%
I'm glad Dennis Schroder still have time updating his Instagram
It was about that time that I noticed Dennis Schroder was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era.
Seth and Dennis don’t have the same game though. The Lakers wanted a ball handler who could create his own offense so LeBron didn’t have to playmake every single possession. It’s why Rondo was so important last offseason. Imagine something like Kyrie in Cleveland (although Lakers are trying to get the Walmart brand version).   Schroder is just inconsistent and his efficiency dropped being a starter vs the 6th man. Schroder sometimes fills the role when he can his shot is falling and he just runs past his defender for a layup but he doesn’t do it night to night. And he’s not a good enough playmaker to keep getting touches if he isn’t scoring.  Seth Curry would have been a great addition I just don’t think he would’ve been in the same role Dennis is in. Curry would have been used pretty close to KCP I imagine.

"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22932422/felony-aggravated-battery-charge-recommended-dennis-schroder-atlanta-hawks  Basically the main catalyst for the Hawks getting rid of him. Don't think he ever got convicted, but apparently he used to own a hookah shop in ATL and do similar things there"
"&gt;Too bad he doesn't have that Manu Ginobili mindset.  This doesn't get talked about enough. If James fucking Harden came out, and said 'I'm willing to come off the bench, I don't care as long as we win' before he was traded coming off an actual 6MOTY campaign and trophy, and a Finals run, then Dennis fucking Schroder should be able to take a seat too."
[Dennis and three friends assaulted some dude outside a hookah bar](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22932422/felony-aggravated-battery-charge-recommended-dennis-schroder-atlanta-hawks) Apparently I misremembered the severity of the attack but they still broke the dudes leg.
"&gt; “I’ve been hearing a ton of (Dennis) Schroder to New York talks, but I’m not sold that will end up happening. Miami is another team to keep a close eye on. They are going to want an upgrade in the back-court and Schroder seems like a perfect fit if the two sides can agree on price.”  This is speculation, not reporting."
i'd bang dennis schroder
I wanna thank the lakers organization for trading d green for fuckin dennis schroder
Dennis schroder
"I understand what you’re point but that’s not a good example, Dennis schroder is not comparable to a former MVP"
Mavs out here banging on Dennis Schroder
The real question is Schroder V. Curry. Its a toss up but im leaning towards Dennis the menace.
Dennis Schroder.  This is a stupid question.
so u think marcus smart is better than dennis schroder?
"I mean take away AD from this Lakers team and who is the 2nd option? Dennis Schroder? He just scored 0 points. Alex Caruso? Genuinely asking. This team is horrific without AD on the floor. Their ""best"" shooter is KCP and he has been trash and injured as well.    I get that you're memeing, but this Lakers team is the opposite of deep. Wes Matthews sucks, Drummond sucks, Gasol can't play big minutes because he's old and slow.    It's just not a good basketball team when it's not LeBron + AD and it reallllllly showed last night"
22/8/7 on 50% shooting this playoffs with a bum ankle and Dennis Schroder as his #2. You guys are ridiculous
How can Schroder be so ass? I wouldn't even let Dennis in the court and just run Caruso in the dirt.
"True, but Dennis Schroder gets paid 15.5 million to score 0 points!"
"That's Dennis ""refused 84/4 extension"" Schroder"
"Dennis ""Despite the Loss"" Schroder"
"&gt; Trading Danny Green who shot 33% from three in the bubble and was constantly fighting injuries in the bubble (hip, wrist) was traded for the 6th man of the year Dennis Schroder. &gt;  &gt; Schroder was supposed to be instant offense off the bench for the Lakers on top of adding another shooter as Schroder shot 38% from 3 the year before the Lakers acquired him on 5 attempts on top of getting to the line 3.6 times per game in 30 minutes off the bench.  Danny Green is a career 40% 3P shooter. He shot 40% this year.  Schroder is a career 34% shooter. He shot 34% this year.  Judging players by single season 3P% (or partial season 3P%) is silly."
"Right? Like he orchestrated the trade that got Davis there and sent away multiple 1st round picks and guys like Lonzo, Ingram, Hart. You can't have it both ways. Can't have your AD trade but then mope around when your team is basically You, AD, and Dennis Schroder lol"
"To be completely honest.. I've always had a hate boner for Schroder. Read a lot of ""Rondo 2.0"" over the last 5 years or so..   But once rondo retires I have to find someone to worship. Sorry for the rough night Dennis, hopefully you bounce back.. and realize you're not as good as Rondo and never will be."
After this season is over i don't wanna see Dennis Schroder and Andre Drummond ever again. Get those bums off my team.
"Dennis ""the O"" Schroder"
I cannot believe Dennis Schroder is his #2 for half this series and thinks he's worth $25m+ its pathetic.  Also I try not to hate on a dude for injuries but its hard to think of a top 10 player the last several decades who is as injury prone as AD
Like Dennis schroder going 0-9? Fuck outta here

"i agree with most of these points.  but trez shouldn't be considered unplayable when our offense came out after halftime running lebron iso's over and over again. it's pretty obvious our entire team has trouble getting to the paint; the suns have made the adjustments to contain schroder before he can get into his comfort zone and there's something clearly wrong with lebron.  it's gotta be mentally draining to dribble around for 20s to settle for a contested three only to come back to the defensive end and have them hit another 3.  tonight and last game's loss is really on vogel for failing to adjust on the fly. try something different if we can't put the ball in the bucket. it's not like kieff is a huge upgrade over trez when either of em get switched onto cp3. it was so obvious he just threw out a lineup that they rarely practiced with hoping for the best, that small lineup literally had no idea what they were doing out there.  the lakers offense has been fucking atrocious for about 6 quarters now in this series and somehow the one big man you have that's enough of a threat as a rollman is now considered ""unplayable?"" yeah no, fuck that excuse.  and dennis schroder lost a couple million per year on his next contract tonight. i'd be surprised if other teams match the 4/84 the lakers offered him earlier this year. i feel like we dodged a bullet.  conclusion is, if this team has to rely on an almost 37 year old lebron james to do a 2018 impersonation of himself to carry this team through until ad comes back, don't even bother. it's not even worth risking more injuries."
Dennis Schroder typing from the locker room right here
That was the offer that was given to him about a little over 2 months ago.     https://www.slamonline.com/nba/dennis-schroder-reportedly-declined-four-year-84-million-extension-with-lakers/
"I won't argue, I desperately want King LeBron to walk on the court and start putting up those 2018 numbers to take em home right from the start, but I think it's pretty clear something isn't working for him so he's trying to establish some help early. It worked last season in the bubble, as bad as some of those games were he persevered and got his teammates into the game by continuously  finding them open looks.  But Dennis Schroder is not Rajon Rondo or Matthew Dellavedova so it's a bigger ask this time. LeBron is 36. This was always gonna happen. I hope we get to see the King takeover again, but it will always be for shorter and shorter spurts unless it turns out he is a Viltrumite"
"Injured forward Anthony Davis yelled out, “There we go! There we go!” Bricklayer KCP gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard(apparently) Dennis Schroder yelled out, “We got no [expletive] squad now.” And before Lebron James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Lebron James hugged him and said, “Y’all trash now”"
Suns already won this series a year ago when Chris Paul tricked the lakers in to trading for Dennis Schroder a year ago... long term booking at its best

"Comparable as in saying they're worse, yeah.  That's not the worst team in the NBA but a team with Dennis Schroder as its best player is not going much of anywhere.  KCP and Kuzma are inconsistent, Harrell is a bad defender, and Morris just straight up isn't very good.  Neither is Drummond."

FUCk man give me $100mil and ill play better than Dennis the fraud Schroder
Dennis Schroder playing like a scared little 5 year old... what is he doing?!
"They actually have a fair amount of flexibility. They have their own 1st round pick this year to trade, as well as a future 1st (either 2027 or 2028 if they want to). On top of that they have KCP's $13 million contract, Kuzma's $13 million contract as well as Marc Gasol's $2.7 million contract and Alfonso McKinnie's $1.9 million contract. In addition they may be able to sign and trade Dennis Schroder, Montrezl Harrell (they could sign him to a 1+1 for $23 million along with early Bird rights), or Talen Horton-Tucker (he could get as much as 4 years and about $83 million).   That's a lot of possible pieces to make salary combinations with if players become available via trade."

"If Kawhi leaves, I think the Clippers finally get a playmaker. In fact they get two. They get a starter in Dennis Schroder and a future piece in THT. Plus they get a bench piece in Kuzma. And a couple of picks too."

Hawks evolved their Dennis Schroder into Clint Capela to make the playoffs.
"Lol Hakeem is a hall of famer with an MVP, 2 finals MVP, 2 DPOYs and 12 All NBA selections  Ayton was struggling to post up on Dennis Schroder"
"its hard to believe we're in game 2 of a playoff series and going into the half its Dennis Schroder, not LBJ leading the team in points, who has just 10    AD looks gassed from staying up late playing Fortnite and isn't even our best AD on the floor    our energy is good but our chemistry sucks tbh, actually really tired of Bron whining and pouting every time someone else blows coverage or a wide open shot, but he just rolls on when he does it"

what in the fuck is wrong with dennis schroder
Dennis Schroder really not guarding anyone on that Chris Paul Shot. Have to do better
"Also, people should be aware that if players miss games it's for being in the health and safety protocol, they aren't missing games for being suspended for violating those protocols. Like Dennis Schroder just missed a bunch of games for being in the health and safety protocol (they don't release the specifics of what that means, like whether he tested positive or whatever due to privacy concerns), but he was not suspended."
"If you had asked me before the playoffs who was going to be better: Reggie Jackson or Dennis Schroder, I would have been wrong"
Reggie Jackson is gonna get the contract Dennis Schroder wanted to get
"Dennis ""shoulda kept rondo"" Schroder"
Would you like a slightly overpaid Dennis Schroder?
"From my understanding they have Dennis, Harrell, Gasol, etc coming off the books and Kuzma and KCP's contracts are pretty easy to move. I'm intrigued to see if they can get Kemba Walker from OKC. He hasn't been amazing but he's a way better scorer than Schroder."
Jrue “Dennis Schroder” holiday
Reggie Jackson is the player Lakers fans wish Dennis Schroder would be
I'm not sure what something Kyrie said has to do with Dennis Schroder?
"Less than a year ago [Schroder said this while he was still in OKC:](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2020/11/15/dennis-schroder-appears-to-have-rejected-trade-to-lakers-last-season/amp/)  &gt; “Yes, I have received offers… But I never wanted to go to the Lakers, the Clippers, or all the names that my agents have have called… In the end, I’m good with GM (General Manager Sam Presti, editor’s note) and that was my decision. I said that I like the organization here better.”  Schroder is not gonna get the kind of money he was looking for this summer, not from the Lakers, not from anyone. He gambled on himself and lost, and now his market is gonna be thin. He could sign something like a 3 or 4 year deal at the lower rate he's at right now, or he could sign something shorter and try to rehab his market value and re-enter free agency in a year or two (he's still only 27).   Look, I don't know if the Lakers are actually going to go after Kemba, but if they did, a hypothetical trade for him could be Kuzma's $13 million, Schroder S&amp;T at $15-17 million on a 1+1, the 22nd pick in this year's draft and maybe Montrezl Harrell if he decides to opt in to that final year and $10 million of his deal (he too probably wouldn't have much of a market this summer and might relish getting to rehab his value for a year in OKC). The Thunder get yet another 1st rounder, and they'd get two or three more players they could also possibly flip in the future."
"So Presti has essentially traded Dennis Schroder for Kemba Walker and 3 first round picks.  &amp;#x200B;  Schroder for Green and a first  Green for Horford and a first  Horford for Keba and a first  &amp;#x200B;  And soon, Kemba for multiple firsts or a player and a first."
"You're forgetting [what he traded to get Schroder,](https://www.nba.com/news/carmelo-anthony-trade-hawks-dennis-schroeder-trade-thunder-official?amp=1) you need to go back a step. Presti traded a lottery protected pick and Melo on a one year $25.5 million contract (who was promptly bought out by Atlanta) for Schroder and TLC."
"The thing is he isn't really like Ainge who refuses to trade a pick. He actually is willing to trade his picks help the team now. During the Durant then WB he was actually trading his picks example: Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Jerami Grant, Melo, Dennis Schroder to name a few. He only transition to ( for the future) GM  after the WB-PG trade.  During the Durant era contrary to them just chocking and bad team creation they were were seriously hit by injuries. In 12-13, Beverly injured WB in the first round: 13-14, Ibaka got hurt during the conference finals (their only answer to Tim Duncan); 14-15, Durant got hurt the whole season; 15-16 was ther only real chance to make it back to the finals but they choked and Durant bounced. I don't think Presti can be blamed for this injuries.  During the WB era, no one really saw them championship contenders.  During PG and WB era- first year was a classic choke job but the second year PG and WB was playing with injuries during the playoffs. PG was an MVP candidate, got his shoulder injured during early March  never really recovered (his shooting avareges shoots way down) and needed surgery right after the playoffs  Personally, I think he can be a championship level GM just really series of unfortunate events and fucking awful coaching hire. Tho looks like the new coach is way better than the previous two (Billy Donovan and Scott Brooks)"
"And by that same token you have to note that everyone thought CP3 was a shell of his former self and no one expected Shai to have the dynamic growth that he showed, on top of Dennis Schroder having a career year, and out of nowhere performances from guys like Lu Dort."
Aggressive Ben is a meme. Lots of guys look great in some games and not great others. Dennis Schroder looks like an All-NBA player like 10 games a year.
This man is gonna get paid like Dennis schroder thinks he's gonna get paid
Just the other day Woj was on with Zach Lowe saying how the Lakers had offered Kuzma and KCP to everyone and that they'd never get a point guard as good as Dennis Schroder with those two. [Oops.](https://mobile.twitter.com/ThePettiestLA/status/1420947832580710404?s=20)
"&gt; acting like they just can't imagine any way their team could possibly take schroder  they just traded away Westbrook, they're likely not going to be a winning team. Why would Dennis change that? Why wouldn't they just get a cheaper PG?"
"&gt;So if, in theory, the Lakers, Kings and Wizards had come to some sort of wink-wink, nudge-nudge agreement on a multi-team deal that involved sending unrestricted free agent Dennis Schröder to the point guard-hunting Wizards, they had to quickly leak a legitimate trade that the money worked on for Westbrook, meaning that Kuzma and Harrell are being directed to the Wizards... at least for now.  &gt;But NBA salary cap expert Yossi Gozlan broke down how the deal could be expanded legally once free agency begins on Aug. 2 for HoopsHype:  &gt;One possibility is trading Schroder straight up for Hield. An $18.6 million starting salary matches Hield’s $23 million salary. Anything higher reduces his outgoing salary to $15.5 million due to Base Year Compensation. The Lakers could include Alfonzo McKinnie on a partially guaranteed amount if Hield’s likely incentives upon being traded to the Lakers require a bit more salary matching. However, the Kings don’t have a fit for Schroder for the type of salary he could command.  &gt;More realistically, the Lakers can get Hield if this trade for Westbrook with the Wizards gets expanded into a three-team deal with the Kings. Schroder would still have to be involved likely at that $18.6 million starting salary amount, but he can be rerouted to the Wizards or a fourth interested team. Connecting the dots, perhaps the Kings could get still get Kuzma or Harrell while the Wizards get Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, and McKinnie.  I think Lakers and Kings fans both want this to happen, not sure how realistic it is though."
"The money being committed to those three players doesn't matter though, the Lakers were going to be over the cap anyway, adding Westbrook didn't change that. They'll have to fill up their roster, of course, but they already should be the favorites to re-sign Wes Matthews, Markieff Morris, Alex Caruso, and Talen Horton-Tucker. They will probably get something for Dennis Schroder in a sign and trade, and then after that they'll have the MLE and vet minimums to use for the remaining 3-5 roster spots."
If the raptors really like Dennis Schroder. Like *really* like.
&gt; Lebron isn’t gonna give up primary ballhandler  LeBron has been trying to do that for years. He gave up a lot of primary ball handling to Dennis Schroder this year. LeBron has got to be over the moon that someone else can handle the ball so he doesn't have to do it.
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there’s Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don’t know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"
"So you're saying ""what if nobody wants Schroder, but also someone with cap space wants him enough to give him a huge contract""? Sounds kinda contradictory, no? If there's a demand for Dennis then a sign and trade becomes likely because the Lakers have his Bird rights. If there isn't much demand for him then nobody will offer him very much. The odds that one of the few teams with cap space is gonna target him for a huge chunk of it is highly unlikely."
"Wow 33.5 to 31.5.  Schroder is so much better!  Dennis ""The Other Curry"" Schroder"
Except there hasn't been any talk of a Dennis SnT to Sacramento. The deals mentioned to Sacramento didn't include Schroder.
"I’m starting to believe Hield is the last trick pelinka has up his sleeve. The last few days, buddy to LA had serious traction and seemed like it was a sure fire thing. Then shams comes out of nowhere with the Westbrook news, and everything goes silent on buddy. Here’s my thinking:  The Lakers end up with both buddy and Russ. How? Reports came out that the Wizards like KCP and really value him. They’re going to need some guard depth as well. This is where Dennis comes into play. Because he’s a FA, nothing can be said about him until august 2nd. So my thinking is the lakers, Wizards, and kings have a “wink wink” deal in place. The Lakers send Dennis and KCP to Washington. There were reports saying that Kuz and Trezz could be rereouted to another team. That other team is Sacramento. Because of Kuzs contract, he cannot be traded until August 6th. FA starts august 2nd, more than enough time for the Lakers to negotiate a S&amp;T with Dennis, so they don’t lose him for nothing and so he gets a somewhat decent payday. So the final return would be:  Kings-Harrell+Kuz  Wizards-Schroder+KCP Lakers-Russ+Buddy  There would also most likely be draft compensation involved, to what extent I don’t know. Maybe other players get involved too, or there’s a rare 4 team deal. Anyways, that’s just my dream/guess lol"
"Dennis Schroder, Kyle Kuzma, and Andre Drummond"
Dennis Schroder? Playmaker? This sub man.
"&gt;It matters when they are trying to build an entire roster on minimum deals  They would have been doing that anyway. Westbrook represents 0 difference in opportunity costs via cap space. The Lakers weren't gonna get under the cap and make max offers, it was always gonna be about ring chasing vets on the minimum.   &gt;Gonna need to do some crazy GM work to get anyone decent to take a minimum.  Supposedly they have guys lining up to do just that, if the rumors are true. The Lakers as contenders with LeBron, Westbrook and AD will attract a lot of ring chasers. The Lakers should also be able to bring back Caruso, THT, Gasol, Wes Matthews and Markieff Morris no problem. And they still have full Bird rights on Dennis Schroder. They should be able to sign or sign and trade all those guys without even using the MLE. Just watch and see. Free agency hasn't even started yet."
Would you not say that Dennis is not at least of similar level to Dinwiddie? And Dinwiddie is coming off a major injury too. Would be weird why they want to go all in for Dinwiddie and wouldn't consider Schroder at all.
"They barely beat an old man who dragged a team of children and Dennis schroder into the playoffs in the West, that's really not the accomplishment you think it is lmfao"
"We need to keep in mind that because of Kuzma's poison pill status this trade can't be executed until August 6. On top of that, the Lakers and everyone else are prohibited from even talking to Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker until free agency opens (see the Bucks-Kings disaster from last year). Given all that I think it's a good bet that this is not the final form of this trade (we already saw Washington move that pick, that will probably just be included in this trade). We could see Buddy Hield still get traded to the Lakers with any of those free agents the Lakers have being signed and traded elsewhere, or we could see something else. We shouldn't be thinking about it like this deal is done and now what are they going to do. Westbrook is gonna be on the Lakers, but the other stuff could very much still be in flux."
"Russ is a huge upgrade over Dennis schroder, that's the way im looking at it"
Maybe even Dennis Schroder 🤔
"I think the idea of Sacramento involves schroder going to Washington. The Lakers send Dennis and KCP plus the draft comp to Washington to give them guard depth, send Kuz, and Trezz to Sacramento, then Sacramento sends Buddy to LA. They wouldn’t be able to announce that since Dennis is a FA, but that’s how I’d imagine it would work (if it even happened lol)"
"I want to point out what the absolute max the Lakers can pay some of these guys would be:  * Wes Matthews - $4,347,600 (using non Bird rights)  * Markieff Morris - $10 million (using early Bird rights)  * Andre Drummond - $5.9 million (using MLE)  * Ben McLemore - vet minimum  * Dennis Schroder - 5 year max starting at 30% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Alex Caruso - 5 year max starting at 25% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Talen Horton-Tucker - full MLE (Arenas limited restricted free agent using early Bird rights)  These guys won't all get the max the Lakers can pay them, of course, but this is how they can fill out the rest of their roster even if they have LeBron, AD and Westbrook."
Who would want $20 mil worth of Dennis Schroder though?
No but I have seen Dennis Schroder lead ours. Lol
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
AKA the day that Dennis Schroder can be signed and traded
"EPM has him in the top 79th percentile for defense. LEBRON genuinely puts him on their advanced analytics all-defensive teams. He's much worse off-ball than on-ball but where did this horseshit narrative come from? Please also consider that the dudes you'd rather the lakers get over his supposed poor defense are *buddy fucking hield and dennis schroder*, neither of whom could defend bugs bunny. Just because off-ball value wasn't what won him MVP doesn't mean he isn't still significantly better as an off-ball threat than dennis"
Dennis Schroder or even Alex Caruso is better for that.
"""Oh behalf of all spurs fans within 5 feet from me, we don't want no Dennis Schroder!"" he declared in a quiet, empty room in a deperate attempt to alleviate his feelings on loneliness"
i’m already sad that the lakers deal fell through and now you want to give us DENNIS SCHRODER?
You can have Dennis Schroder S&amp;T with us.
"""Genius"" was hyperbolic but you're still not engaging with his point, which is that AK's signature move thus far was a trade that most neutral observers saw as dumb at the time and still do.   If the Vuc trade was dumb then your argument of ""AK isn't dumb so he wouldn't do a dumb thing like signing Schroder"" goes out the window. Not to mention [Shroder's already been linked to the Bulls by Woj](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002346-woj-lonzo-ball-dennis-schroder-could-be-bulls-targets-at-pg-in-free-agency).   There's a baseline assumption of AK's competency in the Bulls subreddit that doesn't line up at all with the outside narrative."
Yes. Dennis Schroder is not a good fit on this roster.
The Lakers just traded Danny Green and a 1st for Dennis Schroder last offseason. For whatever reason they don't value 3-D wings
"It makes them worse so no, Dennis Schroder being ass is a better fit  At least he won't have games where he takes more shots than AD and Bron, he knows his role  Westbrook goes brainless"
They traded for Dennis Schroder and did not trade for Lowry lol.
andre drummond and dennis schroder
That's my pass-first point guard Dennis Schroder.
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"Well, speaking as a Laker fan, if the Lakers could get Kemba and all it cost was like a signed and traded Dennis Schroder along with Montrezl Harrell and maybe the 22nd pick in the draft, I'd consider that an upgrade for the Lakers. I'd feel like that even if Kemba wasn't closing games for the Lakers or was a 6th man off the bench (which is all Schroder should have been anyway).   Kemba's not worth anywhere near the money he's getting paid, but the Lakers are capped out anyway, and he'd be a great role player for them. He'd be someone who could help take the load off LeBron when it comes to running the offense and could be a good scorer off the bench or as a 3rd option, and he can hit shots if he's open off ball.   I get why the Celtics did what they did, but if the Lakers pursued him, I'd understand that too. Same with any other contender who's looking for extra PG or scoring help."
"Yes you’re right, but ~2 weeks later Schroeder said that he’s the only one unvaccinated.  May 3rd: [He says he and LeBron are the only unvaccinated ones “I think”](https://twitter.com/ycsnow23/status/1389249713979920386?s=21)  May 15th: [He says he’s the only one that didn’t get vaccinated](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/15/22438022/dennis-schroder-covid-19-protocols-nba-playoffs-vaccine-comments-lakers)  Some people were saying LeBron forced him to amend the statement but that seems like a reach. He doesn’t have much to gain from making sure the public knows he’s vaccinated. Hell, even after that statement, people are still 100% confident that he’s unvaccinated. That comment calling him an asshole got 500+ upvotes with no source."
"Facts for sure. I definitely prefer Lowry, Conley, or Ball to Schroder. Dennis' defense puts him a bit over Dinwiddie for me too"
Does this guy think he’s Dennis Schroder or something?
"I think the only way this happens is if we get rid of Schroder so it's basically replacing Dennis with Westbrook, which isn't a bad idea considering Schroder's contract demands, playmaking and scoring issues imo.  Still a regular season move that may not work in the playoffs"
"Schroeder said [he’s the only unvaccinated player](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/15/22438022/dennis-schroder-covid-19-protocols-nba-playoffs-vaccine-comments-lakers) on the Lakers, so I’m pretty sure LeBron is vaccinated."
Schroeder said [he’s the only unvaccinated player](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/15/22438022/dennis-schroder-covid-19-protocols-nba-playoffs-vaccine-comments-lakers) on the Lakers. You’re spreading misinformation.
"We give you Dennis Schroder, you give us ..... wait ... who do you have?"
"Everyone has been bashing on Schroder, but even Dennis was having some nice moments in the first round before AD went down just because defenses couldn’t afford to pay attention to him. And that’s without a jumpshot. Shit changed real quick when AD got hurt tho, but any really good big strong defenders a team has will be guarding Lebron and AD and Westbrook will be running free"
&gt; Schroder will absolutely think he's as good or better than LaVine which will add to the problems  Lmao what. You make it seem like this would be like Jimmer freezing out Booker. Dennis wants a big deal but he's not a cancer of a player.

Dennis Schroder might be available
Hear me out...how about Dennis Schroder?
"Can I interest you in Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroder and #22?"
"Odds are if the Lakers are going to get either one of them it would be through a sign and trade, rather than via cap exceptions. Doing any S&amp;T would hard cap the Lakers, but if they're willing to do that again (they were last year), then it's really not unrealistic to think they could get both players via S&amp;T. Realistically what would it take to get either player via S&amp;T? I don't think either one would be that daunting to pull off.   Reports are that Montrezl Harrell is probably going to opt in, which would give the Lakers his $10 million contract, Kuzma's $13 million contract and KCP's $13 million contract as salary ballast/assets in trades. They also have Marc Gasol's $2 million and Alfonzo McKinnie's $2 million to throw in to help. Then they could S&amp;T Talen Horton-Tucker or Dennis Schroder, and they have the 22nd pick along with their 2027 1st rounder they could trade. There's enough there to execute a pair of S&amp;Ts."
"Lakers Twitter after seeing this:  Dennis Schroder sign-and-trade for Zach LaVine might be a bit of an overpay, but if we want him, we can have him."
"Fine, you can have Dennis Schroder and an In n Out franchise."
Wait... In this scenario I can replace Dennis Schroder with Luka? Kuzma for SGA? Harrell for Trae Young? Where do I sign up?
"""You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.""      - Dennis Schroder, probably"
"I know lol, this dude is still a good basketball player and when AD went down and Schroder was out we literally couldn’t win a game, even with Lebron, until Dennis came back"
"Remember when people got pissed that Dennis schroder got traded for danny green and a late first? Yeah, i remember"
"Just like there was no way the best package for dennis schroder was bricklayer danny green and a late first, am i right?"
"Dennis Schroder is very replaceable man, I have no idea why the Lakers would decide to overpay for a point guard that can't even shoot that well."
"Three things:  1) I say it for other players, so I'll remain consistent with Schroeder...get that money man. More power to ya. Between his attitude, disappearing play, social media games, etc., I personally wouldn't want to pay him 100 cents. Speaking of attitude and social media games...  2) When you are on a team with LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, KD, now Giannis...nothing else matters but a title. No amount of regular season wins, no amount of regular season awards, a second-round playoff loss means nothing, etc. So, there's a stress you wouldn't find with 25 other teams. Immaturity, liking and unliking Lakers social media accounts, etc., shows a player's true character. Dennis is simply not a winning player.  3) This is where the salary cap really has an impact on the game. Many would say the biggest impact is stopping the major markets from signing the best players, but no. The biggest impact is forcing teams to take on horrendous contracts. The Lakers are pretty much fucked. They have to resign Schroder. The only question is whether or not they find a team stupid enough to take on Schroder's new monster contract in a sign-and-trade."
His full name is Dennis Patrick Beverley Schroder
Give this man Dennis Schroder money
"&gt;Why do you think they end up getting them?  Imo when the Lakers eventually part ways with Dennis Schroder (I don't think the Lakers want him back) they're gonna be severely lacking as secondary ball handler to LeBron and they would probably just be better off taking an established star to fill that role. I think the Lakers will push hard for that. I say Westbrook because he serves as the easiest pathway to acquiring him. CP3 may still want the Suns and Suns would likely not help the Lakers. Lowry requires a double S&amp;T and that would hardcap the Lakers into keeping AC/THT etc iirc  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The DeRozan leak was by a Lakers insider, I'm not trusting that.  Brad Turner is a Laker insider sure, but he is a trustworthy insider who I've relied on news from before. He's trustworthy as a reporter imo."

"Dennis Schroder may get the $100M he wants, but it won't be with a title team like the Lakers.  He will choose the financial over the sports challenge.  With what he has shown (or not shown) during the playoffs, no title contender will give him $100M."
"Yes. It would be harder but I was told no team could move Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook with those contracts and it happened. Twice for CP3. Some team will take on your bad salary if you throw in some other pieces or picks. If they want Westbrook, they can make those salaries almost match and give Washington Kuzma and a ton of picks to get it done. They're not getting CP3 or Westbrook without sending a nice chuck of salary in the trade.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-mulling-russell-westbrook-trade-for-kyle-kuzma-dennis-schroder-and-talen-horton-tucker-per-report/"
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
I personally call him Dennis “boo boo cheeks” Schroder. OP should change his title
Dennis Schroder a little bitch ass with a racing stripe
"Why would the wizards do this? If they’re planning to rebuild I’m not sure what value the lakers trash has to them. Westbrook is expiring next year so it’s not like his contract is this huge burden and it’s not like they’d do anything with the cap space. THT has shown flashes but the lakers only have one first they could give, kuzma is useless to them and paying Dennis Schroder 20 million isn’t conducive to a rebuild"
- Dennis Schroder
"YESSS he does.   I am sick and tired of people saying no Westbrook is a bad fit.   The Lakers are not about shooting three pointers that is NOT their game. What they are going to do is overwhelm you with EASY buckets.   Westbrook and LeBron driving it home and if you try to contest we are laying it off to AD for the easy 2 points.   Schroder was not a ""fit"" either yet the Lakers win the chip most likely if AD stays healthy with Schroder as the #3 option. It's 50/50 with the Lakers vs Bucks.   So Westbrook is an upgrade on Dennis and then add some shooters and away we go"
dennis schroder if he fixes his brain
"2 year 20 million? Schroder rejected a 2 year 33 million extension from the Lakers followed by rejecting a 4 year 84 million extension because he wants more in FA. So if you want to bring on Schroder for 10 million a year when he rejected 21 million a year I think you're in for a surprise.  He wants a long term contract worth $100-120 million, so yeah, having nothing is better than having Schroder for that much. Unless you want to pay Schroder $25 million a year to come off the bench behind Suggs.

I promise you no bulls fan wants Dennis schroder.
"I don’t think Dennis is a role player. He’s clearly a 3rd scoring option that can create offense for himself and others. The guy almost averaged 19PPG off the bench for OKC in 2019.  Is he always the most efficient? Probably not. His FG% leaves a lot o be desired and he turns the ball over at a high clip.  In no way shape or form am I advocating the Lakers throw him 4yrs/$120mil. But it wouldn’t be the most EGREGIOUS contract given his age, injury history, and relative production.  In a perfect world they can S+T him with Kuzma for a better fitting player. But if that doesn’t come to fruition and you are stuck with Schroder and that contract? The Lakers are still a top team for the next few years barring injuries. They’ll have Luol Deng’s stretch dead money coming off the books in 2022 and hopefully a MLE.  LeBron, AD, and Schroder + a developing THT and a bench of Caruso and other good veteran players is still a team that was absolutely dominant in the first third of the season last year."
Jeez. You go to the Finals with Chris Paul one of the greatest point Gaurds ever and then you trade him to the Lakers for Dennis Schroder. You lakers fans gotta come up with more believable rumors.
"Schroder likes to beat up people, and Kuzma dresses a little sus so I can definitely see Dennis trying to beat him up :)"
"Schroder/Trezz really looked like the making of 2019 Lou/Trezz who were awesome off the bench for Clippers.   Then Gasol was 3 and D and has the legacy of Lakers Pau to step into.  They seemed like perfect additions but obviously not only Dennis was a good fit. I know everyone hates him now but he was really good in 4/6 playoff games he averaged 20 ppg in 4 games on good shooting splits but then was awful in 2 games and everyone focuses on that.    Keep Schroder but trade Kuzma, THT and picks for Jerami Grant.    Schroder, KCP, Grant, LeBron, AD"
Maybe he is worth $13 million in regular season but Kuzma is absolutely terrible in the playoffs which is all that matters. For whatever reason he is a choker.   Schroder stats in playoffs he went 14/3/3 on 40/31/84 shooting splits and 1.7 turnovers. When AD was on the court he was 19/5/4 on 50/40/90. Dennis was actually REALLY good the first 3 games. He is not capable of being a 2nd scorer but as the 3rd option he was dope.   Kuzma was actually much better AFTER AD went down to groin injury. Which shows he is a much worse fit alongside AD and LeBron.   Kuzma stats in playoffs 6/4/1 on 29/17/66 shooting splits. He was AWFUL.   I know a lot of Lakers fans have just made up their mind they love Kuzma no matter what and hate Schroder but the stats say you are wrong. It might be a little closer in regular season stat wise but when it matters in playoffs Kuzma is shit.   Even in the championship year Kuzma went 10/3/2 stat line on 43/32/78 shooting splits. that is not good at all. He was not even the 3rd option he dropped behind Rondo and KCP as the 5th best guy. It is sad man this dude is just not that good.   Kuz is a 5th/6th scoring option Role player on good team and maybe a 2nd scoring option on an awful team \[Rockets this season\] where he can post 19 ppg on volume shooting. Who cares that still means he sucks
Dennis Schroder is a coward
You misspelled MPJ as Dennis Schroder. Wild
Underrated: Reggie Jackson  Overrated: Dennis Schroder

"No, those guys would obviously be off the table. But if you're the Suns and you have worries about going all in with 36 year old Chris Paul going forward when the rest of your team is so young, then it's possible they might want to move him now while his value is high. Could they get a legit young star for him? I doubt it, given his age. But like, could they get Ben Simmons or CJ McCollum for him? My guess is no, but maybe I'm wrong.   So if you want to cash in on him now and you can't get a star, then getting a group of young role players and picks is probably the way to go. Maybe the Lakers could throw in Kuzma and the 22nd pick in the draft and then also explore sign and trade deals for Talen Horton-Tucker or Dennis Schroder, with them going to other teams and pieces going back to the Suns in return in a 3-way deal.  Like I said, I think the odds are overwhelmingly that the Suns just re-sign CP3, so this is probably just a moot exercise. But if the Suns did want to go in a different direction or if CP3 really wanted to go to the Lakers, there's always ways to make that stuff happen."
"The lakers cant trade Schroder, Kuzma, and THT together. Only way the trade would work is if Dennis accepts a sign and trade near Russ's salary for like a season or two. Another way it works is through a 3 team trade. Idk how this would work just lakers-wizards trading with one another because I cant think of anything salary wise. Maybe Kuzma, KCP, Harrell (if he accepts his player option) and Gasol for Russ and filler?"
"no bc dennis schroder, kuzma and tht are the deal they trying and even if dennis disagrees then kcp and trezz make up the money"

"Chris Paul is not going to opt out and join the Lakers, I want to make that clear up front. However, if for the sake of argument that is what he wanted to do, it's theoretically possible he could apply pressure to the Suns by telling them to help facilitate a trade to the Lakers or else he could threaten to go sign a big contract with some team with cap space (the Knicks maybe?). Either that or maybe they'd be grateful for what he did this season or would be wary of signing someone his age long term, and would be open to working with moving him to his preferred destination.  If he was able to get the Suns to agree to work with him to get to the Lakers there are two possibilities they could use to do that so that CP3 wouldn't have to just take the MLE. One is he could stay on his current contract (opt in) and the Lakers could sign and trade Dennis Schroder to a one year deal for $35 million in exchange for Chris Paul (technically it would have to be a 3 year deal, but they could make the 2nd and 3rd years non-guaranteed).  The other option, and far more likely one, IMO, would be that Paul opts out and is signed and traded to the Lakers on a new, cheaper contract in exchange for something like Kuzma, Trez and Marc Gasol (maybe along with the 22nd pick in the draft or the Lakers 2027 1st round pick). If it was this collection of players (assuming Trez is OK with going to Phoenix, as he has a player option he'd have to opt in to), the Lakers could then trade for Chris Paul on a 3 year deal worth around $95 million. This would hard cap the Lakers, and that might force them to make some tough decisions regarding Caruso, THT and Schroder, but if we assume they'd prioritize CP3 over all those guys then they definitely could make it work under the cap.   But again, I'll be absolutely stunned if Chris Paul does anything other than just stay in Phoenix. This is merely an exercise in how it *could* happen if that's what he wanted."
Say hello to new Phoenix Suns point guard Dennis Schroder.
1-12 from Jrue looking like a Dennis Schroder statline
I'd disagree - https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22932422/felony-aggravated-battery-charge-recommended-dennis-schroder-atlanta-hawks
"I know he can't stay on the court - that's why I pointed out that Schroder is much healthier.    As for being such ""a negative,"" the fact is that the Celtics were substantially better with him on the court, while the Lakers were better with Schroder on the bench (as his teams have almost always been).    Schroder is a crap shooter, turns the ball over far too often, and the Lakers defense was 5 points worse with him on the court this year.    Schroder's **career high** Box Plus-Minus is 0.0.  He's been in the negative in all but two seasons.  That's a significant downgrade from Kemba.    Kemba's also one of the best guys in the league, while Schroder . . . [is not](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22932422/felony-aggravated-battery-charge-recommended-dennis-schroder-atlanta-hawks)"
"Waiting for The Athletic piece in March about why the Celtic's season went down the toilet and they start off with, ""Dennis Schroder came into training camp and asked if he could change his number to 17. When a perturbed Brad Stevens told him that was impossible, Dennis quickly asked, ""He's dead, right?"" To which Brad Stevens scoffed and walked away."""
"It's all about leverage and timing. Its unfortunate for Dennis that there was a LOT of point guards on the market and few teams that have cap space. Lowry, CP3, Lonzo, Conley, Spencer. Lots of high end starting point guards that are clearly better than Schroder. I'm not sure what he was asking for out there and what his minimum price was my point is that he never waivered on his asking price and got bit in the ass for it"
"Dennis Schroder after turning down the Lakers $84 million offer, ""I just want it to be fair""  Hey Dennis, is that $5.9 million MLE to come off the bench fair enough for you?   You were given the opportunity to be the building block of the Laker's immediate future next to AD and you turned it down.  Hope you like those Boston winters."
JRich is a poor mans version of Dennis Schroder anyways.
"It hasn't gotten the same attention as teams like the Bulls or Lakers (at least until now) but Brad has done a fantastic job in his first offseason imo. I doubt they planned on getting Dennis for the MLE but overall he's really addressed a lot of their needs from the past 1-2 seasons, at least on paper. Horford should bring solid defense, great passing for the 5 (especially important with their need for playmaking), familiar + well-respected in the locker room, and makes sure Williams can manage his minutes. Schroder could be great either as a starting PG or their 6th man and pairs nicely with Smart on defense. I'm not a huge fan of Richardson but he brings them some much-needed bench depth and scoring so their 2nd unit isn't a bunch of rookies again.          A top ~8 of Schroder, Smart, Jaylen, Jayson, Rob Williams, Horford, Richardson, Pritchard is honestly really, really solid especially if the Jays continue their progress from last year. They still need wing depth after the Jays (just like last year) but in the meantime they can see if guys like Nesmith or Langford can step up before making a move later in the summer or at the deadline."
"Dennis Schroder, master negotiator. After turning down the Lakers $84 million contract, he goes to the Celtics and basically this happens:  * ""What's your offer?""  * ""One year at the MLE.""  * ""No, I need both more money and more years than that.""  * ""That's all we're offering.""  * ""OK I'll take it."""
"Smart shot 33% last year and a 32% career player, Dennis shot 33.5% last year and 33.7% career... This ain't 2002, this is not a starting backcourt. Schroder probably backs up Smart."
"SCHRODER BABY TOP 5 PG IN THE LEAGUE, CELTICS NOW A CONTENDER. DONT READ ANY OF MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS ALWAYS BEEN A DENNIS FAN"
Dennis Schroder on $5.9 million is an extremely good problem. Like that's a problem most teams would like to have.
"Dennis ""Leon Lett"" Schroder"
ITT: grateful Lakers fans and copious Dennis Schroder slander.
Nobody on the internet is dictating what Dennis Schroder does in his free time lol.
This needs to become a meme. Dennis Schroder showing off his \_\_\_\_ skills with him photoshopped doing random shit.
When keeping it real goes wrong: Dennis Schroder edition  Seriously feel bad for him. It's like asking a girl to prom and she says she's not going to prom. Then you see the pics on social.
"&gt;You know there’s two guard positions right? So Smart and Dennis could play at the same time.   What is the Celtics rotation going to look like? Is Jaylen Brown going to play almost exclusively small forward with Tatum playing almost exclusively power forward? I was under the impression those guys would probably be mainly the 2/3 combo for Boston, but I could be wrong. I think if you put Smart and Schroder out there together that's a dangerous lack of shooting from your guards, but maybe they make it work.   &gt; And they could both be playing hard af for a contract next year. So how would that be a bad thing?   Having just watched a Lakers team that had a bunch of guys angling for free agency, I will say that guys playing hard for a contract does not necessarily mean they're doing what the team needs them to do. If one of Smart or Schroder feels like they're not getting enough minutes or touches, it could lead to poor chemistry with so much money on the line. That could be a lot for a first time coach to be trying to navigate.   &gt; Dennis played with LeBron, a ball dominant player who is basically a point guard, and still almost got that huge contract.  I don't know how close Schroder was this summer to getting a big contract. The Lakers offered him a big one back in February, but that was mainly because they had traded Danny Green and a 1st for him and didn't want him to just end up walking like he's going to. The Lakers were in a position where it was OK to overpay him to keep him, especially because LeBron has for years been looking for someone else to take over many of his ball handling duties. The Lakers also were going to be over the cap either way, so the money wasn't as much of an issue.  &gt;Also, I could totally see a rebuilding team sign him for 20m/yr  You shouldn't look at it like some stupid team will make a mistake and give Schroder a lot of money, you should look at it like if *your* team was bad and rebuilding, how happy would you be if their big splash in free agency was offering Schroder $20 million in cap space. Personally I don't think that market is going to be there for him. It wasn't even close to being there for him this summer, and that's after a year starting for a team. Having to share minutes with a couple other guards probably won't showcase him to the point where another team makes him a big offer. My guess is if he signs the MLE this summer, he'll be doing the same somewhere else next summer.   The only exception I'd make to this is if the Celtics really are planning on trading Marcus Smart as has been rumored a couple times. If they do that, then Schroder might be able to showcase himself to get something decent in free agency next summer. Not $20 million per year, but maybe $10-15 million."

"  [Him and his entourage beat up someone in a parking lot tearing their Meniscus and ACL, video showed that Schroder initiated the fight.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2766903-dennis-schroder-may-face-felony-battery-charge-after-fight-that-led-to-arrest)"
"Meh, I think is Dennis Schroder is going to be what drives your ticket sales your team is kinda fucked."
"This is part of the reason that I don’t like Dennis Schroder, but this was a tough story to read. I feel a little bad."
"Dennis Schroder is indeed to blame for rejecting this offer from the Lakers.  However, his agent is the real culprit. Schroder should definitely change.  It is normal for a player to overestimate his value after all. The agent is there to bring him back down to earth by reminding him of the realities of the market.  Schroder's agent probably didn't do that, and now Schroder is going to have to sign a one-season contract to prove his worth again.  The Celtics seem ready to offer him 5M over a season... This is a far cry from the 100M contract Schroder was asking for."
"It's not that wild.  Lakers didn't offer 4/84M because they were generous. They offered it because they were afraid he'd be offered *MORE* in free agency.    I love the Lakers. But I think everyone is completely overreacting about this Dennis Schroder situation.  He had a bad playoff but lots of players have had bad playoff runs.  He's not worth 4/84M but he worth far, far more than $5.9M and someone's gonna get a huge bargain."
"i *kiiiiinda* agree with you to a certain extent.   dennis was their second go to guy since AD went down.   AD went down in game 4   dennis went 0 points 0-9 in game 5   for someone who said was a 6th man and came off the bench and turned into a ""i'm starting no matter what"" player, it wasn't a good look for him. they offered him the contract because they were forced to and couldn't find an appropriate PG to upgrade to.   dont get me wrong, im not saying KCP and Kuz didnt shit their beds either, but their expectations weren't as high   WB is definitely a better schroder in terms of overall talent and playmaking but spacing issues will be determined."
"He had a very similar season to Kelly Oubre Jr. in those respects, demanding a starting spot, underperforming, poor attitude. Although, Dennis Schroder seems a good amount better and would probably jumpt at a 26/2 deal now"

"&gt; Don’t, the dude has a huge ego and tried to strong arm the lakers into way overpaying him.  Gosh, a player tried to use their leverage to secure a better deal for themselves. Can you imagine the audacity.  &gt; demanded a starting role which hurt the team imo  I don't think he needed to demand anything to be a starter; I know we're very high on Caruso and very low on Dennis Schroder right now but Schroder coming off the bench just wouldn't be sensible with the roster that the Lakers had. The fact that the player they brought in to replace him is a PG who dominates the ball and can't shoot 3's very good is only evidence that the Lakers were thinking the same thing.  I'm not sad because I think he's impoverished now or because he can't get that additional mansion - it's just a little sad to see someone bet on themselves and it backfire."

"You know it's kind of crazy that if Solo didn't land on LeBron's ankle Dennis Schroder would've gotten his payday.

&gt; the final tally was trading Dennis Schroder and $12 million for three 1st round picks.  Holy shit that's insane value for Dennis. The final dollar amount really doesn't matter - OKC's owners are rich as fuck anyways. Presti is truly a legend.
"The actual number is $12.1 million, and we need to remember that they got a 1st round pick both when they traded for Horford and when they shipped him out. If you include the Dennis Schroder trade (which got them Danny Green, which then got them Horford), the final tally was trading Dennis Schroder and $12 million for three 1st round picks."

"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks.

"You'll take Dennis Schroder, and you'll like it."
"&gt;You said he'd be one of the best in the league 20 years ago, but then also said he wasn't anywhere near the caliber of player those two players are. So which is it?   My god, learn to read!  How many times do I have to tell you?  I did not say that Schroder ""wasn't anywhere near"" their caliber.  I said he was not their caliber.  Learn to read!  Learn to read!  Learn to read!  &gt;Similarly, you said he'd play a role that (according to you) was very common ""up until 20 years ago"" (when they all magically vanished)  They did not magically vanish, as the very presence of this thread illustrates.  And there are a few others around: TJ McConnell, Rajon Rondo, Pat Beverley, etc.  Again, if you don't have the slightest idea on the topic at hand, consider silence as an appealing alternative to continuing to demonstrate your complete ignorance.  &gt;, and at the same time wasn't as good as at least 3 of the players you mention below at it. How are we defining that he would have been ""one of the top point guards?""  Learn to count!   3 != 2.  &gt;So 6 players constitutes ""fairly common"" eh?  What do you suppose the words ""and others"" mean?  Holy god are you dumb.  &gt; And you even had to stretch to old journeymen at the tail end of their careers like Mookie and Mark Jackson to fit your narrative? And that's to say nothing of John Stockton, who was 39 at the time. If they're so common, why is there like three we've come across? Not exactly convincing evidence my guy.  What on earth have their ages got to do with anything?  Your red herrings are increasingly pathetic, and I'm about done wasting my time trying to teach you thing-one on this topic.  &gt;Again, you said they were fairly common up until 20 years ago. But then, as soon as we get to 20 years ago, they're suddenly hard to find.  They're not even all that hard to find today, as I just illustrated.    &gt; Should I go through the '99-'00 season as well? How many more ""old school"" point guards do you think I'll find?  I'm sure you'll find zero, but then I'm equally sure that you couldn't find your ass with both hands and a flashlight, so that's not saying much.  &gt;And will they all be as valued as you imply Dennis would be?   Again, learn to read.  I never implied any such thing.  &gt;Go on and take a well-educated super-literate big brain guess.  The mere fact that you think simple reading comprehension requires an enormous brain, far beyond what you possess, pretty much ends this thread."
"&gt; You noticed that too, huh? Could that be because you didn't understand anything previously written, and wasted a thousand keystrokes inventing red herrings to argue against?  A red herring isn't a strawman; dingleberry.  &gt; Those two statements are completely coherent. Schroder is not one of the top point guards today. He would have been at virtually any time more than 20 years ago.  You said he'd be one of the best in the league 20 years ago, but then also said he wasn't anywhere near the caliber of player those two players are. So which is it? Similarly, you said he'd play a role that (according to you) was very common ""up until 20 years ago"" (when they all magically vanished), and at the same time wasn't as good as at least 3 of the players you mention below at it. How are we defining that he would have been ""one of the top point guards?""  &gt; ""Fairly common until about 20 years ago"" does not, in fact, imply any of the nonsense you concocted.  &gt; And for the record, there were several around the league in 2001: Mookie Blaylock, Mark Jackson, Jason Kidd, John Stockton, Gary Payton, Eric Snow, and others.  So 6 players constitutes ""fairly common"" eh? And you even had to stretch to old journeymen at the tail end of their careers like Mookie and Mark Jackson to fit your narrative? And that's to say nothing of John Stockton, who was 39 at the time. If they're so common, why is there like three we've come across? Not exactly convincing evidence my guy.  Again, you said they were fairly common up until 20 years ago. But then, as soon as we get to 20 years ago, they're suddenly hard to find. Should I go through the '99-'00 season as well? How many more ""old school"" point guards do you think I'll find? And will they all be as valued as you imply Dennis would be? Go on and take a well-educated super-literate big brain guess."
"&gt;You're in the minority,  and I don't agree with your ""opinion""  And it's still not an opinion, despite your continued and pathetic inability to understand it.  And regardless of how many attempts you make to distract from the fact that you cannot even formulate a counterpoint, it will remain true.  &gt;People who actually watched Schroeder instead of scrolling through basketball reference will say the same thing.  You are still resorting to a logical fallacy, and it's still called ""argument from authority"", and it still means that you are unable to make a valid argument.  And worse, I am one of those people who watched almost every Laker game, so you're appealing to my authority.  In other words, you are still talking out of your asshole.  &gt;Like I said, there's a reason why Schroeder is viewed that way. You don't have to agree, but it's dumb to ignore it  I'm not ignoring it, I'm illustrating why -- with verifiable facts, not opinions -- why that view is wrong.  Again, just because you are too stupid to understand simple basketball, does not change the facts of the situation.  So go ahead, give it a shot.  Try and make a valid argument to support why a team would want Dennis Schroder -- who was 116th out of 124 qualifiers in effective FG% last season -- taking a large volume of shots.  ""Other people think so"" is not a valid argument, by the way, that just means you are too stupid to process the information and form your own opinion."
"&gt;Which is exactly why I said ""who got paid like Dennis wants to get paid.""   So why, exactly, did you list two shooting guards when we were talking about point guards?  Because you've no idea what you are talking about, like I said.  &gt;Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton are the ones you mentioned there that 1) actually played 20 years ago, 2) actually were stars. But guess what? Those aren't the guys Dennis Schroeder plays like.  Schroder is not asking to be paid like a star.  $20M, even $25M, is not presently star money.  Gary Harris and Danilo Gallinari are over $20M, as are a whole bunch of other players.  And yes, other than the fact that Schroder is quicker, those are two players similar to how Schroder played for the Lakers last year.  I did not say that Schroder was the caliber of those players.  Consider learning how to read.  Having a similar style is not the same as being as-good.  &gt;Jason Kidd percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('02): 14%   Gary Payton percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('96): 25%   Dennis Schroeder wants more than 20% of the cap.  Again, consider learning to read.  I never even discussed Schroder's salary, or his requests.  That said, in his 9th season, Kidd signed a massive contract with an average value of $17M per, which was around 30 to 40% of the cap each year.  &gt;If you're just saying ""old school point guards"" to mean someone who plays the traditional point guard role then just say that.  I did, and for the third time, consider a remedial reading comprehension class or discontinue wasting my time with your nonsense.  &gt;So let's go through it, let's take out receipts. Here are the Eastern Conference point guards who started the most games for their teams, and you tell me which one Dennis Schroeder is most like in terms of being a traditional point guard and we'll see if they're getting 5 year deals at an average of one fifth of the annual cap if they aren't high volume low efficiency guys:  Again, learn how to read.  I never said that Schroder's contract demand -- whatever it currently is -- is reasonable.  You are arguing red herrings that you completely invented, in order to cover for your embarrassing lack of knowledge and/or accuracy.  &gt;Also, get the fuck out of here with ""Don Buse"" and ""Mo Cheeks."" Sure, if we want to go back 50 years you can talk about ""old school point guards"" then, but that's not what you said.  Again, learn how to read.  If you cannot figure out what the words ""old school"" mean, look them up.  There are dictionaries online, you don't even have to buy one.  &gt;And if you just want to say ""well he would've been better if he played a long time ago!"" Well shit, Thaddeus Young would've dominated in the 50's and 60's!  Again, learn how to read.  And also, educate yourself on basketball history.  Thaddeus Young would not be an extraordinary player in those decades, and if you knew one-hundredth as much as you think you do, you'd know that, and I wouldn't have to tell you.  &gt;So where are these ""old school point guards... who handles and distributes the ball, and guards ferociously to stop the opponent from doing the same... typically didn't shoot much, nor particularly well... were usually small and exceedingly quick, and they were fairly common until around 20 years ago"" at all  For the final time, learn how to read.  Saying something was common until around 20 years ago does not necessarily mean that it was common exactly 20 years ago.  Do yourself a favor.  Delete your reddit account, and go back to grade school."
"&gt;So my point was yes, Schroder can be the starting PG for a bad team, but if you have a good team you don't want him starting for you, you want him as the backup PG.  That's very debatable.  Schroder was 18th in assists per game among point guards last season -- despite not being the primary ballhandler on his team -- and 15 of the 17 ahead of him make vastly more money ( except for a couple still on their rookie deals ).  He's a better defender than almost all of them, too.  At $20M or less, it's very difficult to find a better option as a starting point guard than Dennis Schroder.  At the $15.5M he played for less year, it's impossible, unless you were lucky enough to draft a Doncic or Morant.  That said, you don't want him starting on a team that's offensively-challenged -- like the Lakers sans James and Davis -- because you don't want Schroder taking shots in volume.  But if you can surround him with good players, he's a very decent option for the money.  The Lakers' best 2-man combination, in terms of point-differential last year, was James+Schroder.  Schroder+Davis was the 2nd-best pairing that didn't include James.  In other words, he was quite good last year, for $15M."

"AD and LBJ weren't there for a stretch, that's insane he still kept it up. You had KCP and Dennis Schroder anchoring the defense."
AD has mvp seasons when he has pass first playmakers feeding him.   Rondo and Jrue in 2018 Bron and Rondo in 2020 Westbrook and Bron hopefully in 2022.  Dennis Schroder wasn’t doing that last year. Trezl was also redundant for ADs game.
"I didn't say it was going to work, I'm just trying to figure out why Dennis is wasting his time trying to hustle money from Boston when it's clear they're a team who isn't willing to pay anything. Schroder doesn't seem to be very bright or self aware."

"Still not proof, but better than my conjecture: [Dennis Schroder claims everyone on Lakers is vaccinated except him and LeBron James](https://www.google.com/amp/s/lakersdaily.com/dennis-schroder-claims-everyone-on-lakers-is-vaccinated-except-him-and-lebron-james/amp/)"
"“James' teammate Dennis Schroder, who recently finished a 10-day stint in the health and safety protocols, told a German-language publication earlier this month that he and James were the only Lakers players who hadn't received the vaccine.  Schroder later updated his vaccine roll call, telling reporters last weekend, ""I'm the only guy that didn't get vaccinated. I'll just leave it at that.""  It would appear, however, that there is at least one other player on the Lakers besides Schroder who has not been vaccinated. Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Friday that L.A.'s roster has not passed the 85% vaccination threshold the league requires -- a minimum of 15 out of 17 players -- for a team to have its health and safety restrictions lessened moving forward.  ""We have not reached it yet, but we're still hopeful,"" Vogel said. ""And I think there's obvious benefits from the standpoint of us being able to do more things with each other in the cities that we're going to. Something that's been absent leaguewide in terms of team building and team bonding for all of us.”"
"He's not vaccinated. The article says 2 of Lakers players aren't vaccinated. People are misunderstanding +staff - staff is in another number. The roster itself (17 players) need to meet the 85% criteria.   &gt;It would appear, however, that there is at least one other player on the Lakers besides Schroder who has not been vaccinated. Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Friday that L.A.'s roster has not passed the 85% vaccination threshold the league requires -- a minimum of 15 out of 17 players -- for a team to have its health and safety restrictions lessened moving forward.  NBC also reported the same thing about the restrictions - separating the numbers for players and staff.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/04/27/adam-silver-more-than-70-of-nba-players-have-received-coronavirus-vaccine/  &gt;That will keep both them and those around them safer and hasten a return to normalcy. The NBA has implemented relaxed restrictions for teams with 85% of players and 85% of staff fully vaccinated.  Dennis Schroeder lied when he said he was the only laker player who didn't get vaccine."
"Just because he's influential doesn't mean he's required to tell the public if he's been vaccinated or not, that's only his and the NBA's business.  I know you're going off Dennis Schroder saying he and LeBron were the only guys on the team who hadn't been vaccinated in a throwaway line, but he's recently said he's now the only one who hasn't got the vaccination.   https://twitter.com/billoram/status/1393690365203402753  All public information (Above quote and NBA not punishing him for this violation) points to LeBron being vaccinated but you'd rather ignore all of it."
"&gt; Dennis went to a restaurant and amusement park while they lakers were in NY and vlogged about it. He was not put in protocol.  It took 5 seconds to Google that he [did in fact get placed in protocol](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10001838-lakers-dennis-schroder-reportedly-out-10-14-days-because-of-covid-19-protocols). This was big news for us, since it forced him to miss some very important games like the Blazers game which made us slip into the playins."
Nobody knows exactly which Lakers were vaccinated. We just know what Dennis Schroder told us and he said everyone but him was vaccinated but he got his vaccine. The team keeps things super tight lipped. Back at the beginning of the pandemic two Lakers got COVID and to this day we have zero idea which ones they were. There weren't photo opportunities when the Lakers got vaccinated like other teams. It was just reported that some of them got the vaccine.
Dennis Schroder is definitely not D. Wade.. but he's the closest as far as smoothness in his play style imo
"Curry diving to the floor like a sniper took him out, after being almost brushed by that beast Dennis Schroder.  https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=396&amp;GameID=0052000121&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Schroder%20S.FOUL%20(P1.T2)%20(J.Tiven)&amp;sct=plot  Got 3 points for that one, while all Valanciunas got was ball-out."
"Dennis Schroder playing like a ""top-tier"" PG"
Dennis Schroder is a liability and I think it's pretty easy to see through this game.
Their 3rd best player is Dennis Schroder who also looked less than 100%  And AD is coming off a regular season where he was battling nagging injuries
"Make no mistake, Anthony Davis played like an absolute pussy for most of this game. But also Draymond Green was incredible defensively.   Steph Curry and LeBron James are basketball Gods.   I haven't liked Dennis Schroder for a single second this season, he was playing for the Warriors tonight.  Alex Caruso is a fucking dog. I love him."
"Everyone's talking about the refs, meanwhile we're all forgetting that Dennis Schroder tried to play hero ball while going 3-14"
"Draymond Green really is built different.  So is Dennis Schroder,but not in a good way."
Lebron with one of the greatest shots I've ever seen.  Dennis Schroder losing himself about $100m as we speak.
Dennis Schroder is literal garbage. If I was a Lakers fan I would hate his guts.
Is Dennis Schroder really part of the Lakers 'Big Three'?
Dennis Schroder kinda sux
What the hell is this plan to play through Dennis Schroder and Andre Drummond lol
"Sure, but he did get heavy minutes from known defensive stalwarts Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroder, and Andre Drummond, so is it really that impressive?"
Dennis «didnt take the vaccine» schroder
"Do you not think Smart and his agent would believe he could get the same kind of offers that Dennis Schroder and Lonzo Ball will get? He's not a max player, but someone will probably be willing to give him more than $20 million per year."
"...we aren't winning a championship with Schroder either. Other significant changes would need to happen, and Lonzo is one of this offseason's 2 ""biggest"" free agents (other being Derozan). So I say again, Lonzo factually fits our timeline better than Dennis."
Exactly you have LeBron and AD which is enough to win now. Dennis Schroder is not some game changer worth missing a chance at 2 max players when LeBron expires.  The Lakers won a championship without Schroder.
"They had the unprotected Kings pick and Grizzlies pick which everyone thought were gonna be high lottery picks and instead ended up both being 14th (Langford and Nesmith, not exactly impact guys), and on top of that they had three max level players just walk away from them in free agency over the course of two summers, in Kyrie, Horford and Hayward. It's really not surprising that they took such a large step back this year.  If I had to pick someone who won't be back with Boston next year, it's not Brad Stevens, it's Evan Fournier. To re-sign him Boston would have to go into the luxury tax, and it's extremely unlikely they're gonna do that after the season they just had.   I'll also be curious to see what happens with contact extension negotiations with Marcus Smart this summer. Given the contract FVV got and what Dennis Schroder thinks he's worth, I'd have to imagine Smart probably believes he's worth somewhere around $22-25 million per year, and I have a feeling Boston won't want to give him that much. If Boston can't negotiate an extension with him, will they try to trade him or just let him go through next year on an expiring deal? That didn't work very well for them with Kyrie, Horford and Hayward."
Funny thing is Dennis Schroder is an extremely basic German name
"The Lakers are going to make the decision that gives LeBron and AD the best chance to win another title.   If Dennis gives them that best chance (he does), he's going to get that money. There is no one else the team can offer that money to.   When the Lakers have a good team with a chance to win titles, they have always spent. I would be very, very surprised if they let Schroder walk."
"- I think there's a chance Dennis Schroder doesn't re-sign and the Lakers get a buyout John Wall. And I think it will work out for them, he has a lot left in the tank, just can't lead a bad team.  - The Warriors seriously shop Wiseman, Minnesota pick (whatever it becomes), and Wiggins together.   - Everyone in Portland will be on the block, but they will keep Dame and CJ   - if the Clippers don't make the conference finals, they will shop PG."
In ten years nobody is going to remember Dennis Schroder
"Hell no! If they did, Dennis Schroder would have won 6moty last season when he played for OKC.   I'm convinced NBA journalists watch games and/or highlights of the glamour market teams (LAL, LAC, GSW, BKN), some games and/or highlight of other highly ranked teams (Utah, Denver, etc.), and an occasional highlight for the other teams (OKC, Det, etc.)."
"Dennis Schroder: ""It was me."""

I mean as long as you don't look arrogant out there it should be fine. Dennis Schroder doesn't help himself when he's a little too cocky for what he's actually contributing.  Should've secured the bag when the Lakers were on a roll at the beginning of the season

You know what the article means.   Dennis Schroder was their 2nd best passer last year and AD the 3rd.   Nobody could say the team didn’t heavily struggle offensively when Bron wasn’t babysitting his teammates.
&gt;  Plus they both signed short deals to potentially leverage this season into a much bigger deal if they shine in LA.  *sad Dennis Schroder noises*
Dennis Schroder.
"Guys who did the “i’ll bet on myself, so i can make more money” worse? Nerlens Noel when the Mavericks offered him 4 for 70 or Dennis Schroder who turned down 4 for 84? I’ll say Schroder at least Noel got kinda paid this offseason with the Knicks, but it took him like 4 years to recover! Schroder will be 31-32 ish in 4 years lol"
"I mean if Dennis Schroder still thinks he deserves a fat paycheck in this league, Jimmer can find a team that needs him lmao"
LA can offer one slightly used Dennis Schroder they can sign and trade.
"I think you're inferring that representation.  Now I feel like we're going in circles.  There is a market for Dennis Schroder.  Dennis Schroder's agent is the person responsible for telling Dennis Schroder what that market is.  We don't know what Dennis Schroder's agent told Dennis Schroder what exactly his market was.  But, it's Dennis Schroder's agent's obligation as Dennis Schroder's agent to tell Dennis Schroder what his value is on the open market.  Not trying to be a pain in your ass.  I just genuinely don't understand why you think I've said two different things."
"One Dennis Schroder on an MLE, please!"
&gt; Just a couple comments up you admitted that his agent may have told him there's not a market in FA.  Definitely did not say that.  There is 100% a market for Dennis Schroder.  Schroder's actual value on the market is what's preventing Dennis Schroder from signing a deal.  Schroder obviously thinks he's worth more than the market does.   &gt;Your first comment wasn't phrased as a hypothetical; it was phrased as something the agent did.  Absolutely.  I don't think it's unreasonable to claim that Schroder's agent performed his most basic obligations to his client.
Dennis Schroder was totally out of step with his real value on the market and what he thought he was worth.  His representatives should have helped him understand that he had to accept the Lakers offer of a 4 year 84M contract.  They didn't do their job properly in my opinion.
“I’m just gonna send it” - Dennis Schroder.
"Yeah I'm experiencing some *serious* Schroder-freude (clever portmanteau of Schroder and schadenfreude that I invented) every time I open a thread about Dennis these days, what a frickin moron lmoa  I don't have a lot going for me right now, so it's quite satisfying for me to get to feel superior to an NBA player. I bet this is what it feels like to actually dunk a basketball!"
Dennis Schroder sleeps with the fishes?!
Dennis Schroder is being black balled from the league? i said Dennis Schroder is being black balled from the league my ass.
"""Heat to sign Dennis Schroder to a 4 year, 100 million dollar deal"""
"I mean not really. This isn't an IT situation. Dennis Schroder has tons of value in the league, just not at the money he wanted. He was holding out for a specific dollar amount that he didn't get so now the money has dried up, but next year he's likely going to get paid a pretty decent contract. I mean it sucks for this season because he's likely coming back to the Lakers on whatever exception they have left but he'll likely be traded at the deadline so he'll be alright."

"Issue comes up when a Dennis Schroder type of player believes he’s Steph Curry and therefore should be getting the ball and as many shots as Steph, only to the detriment of the other players on the team."

"The agent did get the best deal for them, the 84 million was a great offer for Schroder who was a career loser whenever he got serious minutes on a team that didn't have Chris Paul holding his hand.  It's not the agents fault Dennis is a dumbass."
"Just a useful roster filler my g.   Dennis put himself in this spot anyway, and it doesn't look like anyone else is lining up to sign him right now. He can be the third string PG, and this would be in Schroder's and the Lakers' best interest. Lakers get deeper and Schroder has a job."
"As a Lakers fan, yes I think this is an excellent idea. He could be MVP once traded to your team! Unfortunately, he requires slightly more than whatever your current cap space is. We will sign and trade future MVP Dennis Schroder to you for some of your crummy old future draft picks. You’re welcome."
Yes cause he's gonna see that Rozier is starting over him then mope about that.      Signing Dennis Schroder is just not worth it until he gets some humility and be a 6th man like in OKC
It feels like Lauri pulled a Dennis Schroder and it's going to go wrong here. Spurs probably were like gtfo.
"naw the agent already got the deal. what we've been seeing is that schroeder just turned it down. agent got him a great deal and he apparently refused. although i guess we don't know everything, if the agent persuaded dennis that he could actually get more, from the lakers or someone else, then that's obviously on him. but it sounds like the agent did his part. although again its possible maybe he didn't admonish schroder enough to take the deal."
[Washburn] Dennis Schroder is screaming in the Lakers front office and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Schroder comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Contract offers are imploding. Pelinka is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from office.
"Dennis"" nerlens noel"" schroder"
"Dennis Schroder has made $70 Million Dollars in his 8 year career and just bought a luxurious $4 Million dollar home. He’s also sponsored by Nike. He did lose out on millions with the lackluster playoff series vs the Suns, but his family is financially secure for the rest of their lives."
"[Spears] AD yelled, “There you go!” Westbrook  gave a look of pleasant surprise. Malik Monk belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Dennis Schroder hit the locker room door, ex- teammate Lebron James hugged him &amp; said, “That's tuff 🔥💯”"
Interesting. Dinwiddie scored slightly more points but Schroder was far more efficient and also played significantly better defense. I'd give the playmaking edge to Dinwiddie but I'm not sure it's enough to make up for everything else.   I just think Dennis did a lot more for his team than Spencer. The 3 guard lineup that OKC had was extremely dangerous thanks to his play.
"Or Willzets, as in ""Will ze Tianjin Pioneers take a chance on Dennis Schroder?"""
Dennis Schroder in shambles
"I continue to be fascinated by whatever is going on with Dennis Schroder. What is he ultimately going to get? At this point I'm guessing he probably just wants to take a one year deal and hope he has more luck in free agency next summer, but even if he took a one year deal, what's the most anyone would give him?"
Does Boston still have their MLE? I think Schroder would actually fit well on their team. Dennis isn't THAT bad a player he's just another media scapegoat imo.   He's definitely worth it on an MLE contract.
Dennis schroder is fuming right now

"[Fivethreeeight projection based on 19-20](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/alex-caruso/)  [RAPTOR 20-21](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) literally has him at +3.9 on D, tied for 1st with Dort in guards.  I'm not claiming that he can shutdown Kyrie/Harden/KD (there's not many in the league that can); he is however the best defender we have on a team that was 3rd in DRTG in 19-20 and 1st in DRTG in 20-21, and Danny Green is the only one that came close in D-RAPTOR - defense is team effort, but given the same team as his comparisons KCP / Danny Green / Wesley Matthew / Dennis Schroder, (the Lakers, 19-20 and 20-21), the results are better when Caruso is on the court vs. when he's not, which also shows up on other metrics like DBPM, On/Off.  I think we can agree to disagree, meanwhile the Bulls are paying 37M/4yr so there's that."
"Don't you all have some TPE's? Seems like a S&amp;T for a bit more would benefit everyone. You guys get bird rights to Schroder to bring him back in case y'all hit it off, Dennis gets more money, &amp; the Lakers could potential use that TPE to address needs during the season."

"Theres rules about how much money you can spend.. there’s a salary limit essentially. However there’s tons of loopholes that allow you to go way over the limit as long as you’re signing players who are already on your roster.   So the Lakers for example.. if Dennis Schroder leaves then the money they could have paid him can’t be used to pay anyone else. He’s the only player they can give that money to. So they can either let him walk, or they can try to get him to agree to a sign and trade so they sign him for 10 million per year and then they are able to trade him for another player making that much. Without the sign and trade they wouldn’t be able to bring in a new player"

"Dennis Schroder and Ben Simmons are two little off-season storylines I'm honestly fascinated by. I am extremely compelled by the idea that before the start of the season Dennis Schroder has two offers on long MLEs, and 76ers best offer for Simmons is two first rounders and CJ McCollum."
But that still depends on another team finding value in a 20/year Dennis Schroder; and that team having the cap space and/or a player on a similar contract they'd be willing to give back.

"Dinwiddie always struck me more of a score-first/volume-scorer person than Schroder, so it might depend on the team situation. Defensive rating also leans slightly in favor of Schroder (OKC + LAL vs dinwidde on the nets); that might be in part due to the team defense, but I'd say Schroder is better defensively  Before the kd/kyrie/harden were playing, iirc dinwiddie was definitely taking a lot of shots and usually the guy holding the ball most of the time. Actually, at this time it looks like dinwiddie averaged more assists than schroder -- maybe confounded by a higher usg rate. Then the big question was how dinwiddie would fit with other high-volume scorers (and caris was coming into his own as well). When the nets big 3 arrived, dinwiddie got injured, so it was hard to really make an assessment.  Schroder on OKC -- he played pretty well in that SGA-CP3-schroder lineup without being super ball dominant. So that makes me think Schroder can coexist along other scorers. On the lakers, his FGA dropped a little bit; tbh I think it probably would have dropped more if the lakers were healthy with lebron/AD. His assists also looked better than in prior seasons.

"Teams would happily take Schroder on a small contract. Problem is if Dennis isnt getting the contract he wants, it makes sense for him to just stay put for a one year dael and try again next year."
"And now every team are getting their guards  Schroder and Oladipo should get the award for Dumbass of the Year. These 2 morons combined turned down over $200m (4/80+ for Dennis, 4/120 for Oladipo)"
"Dennis literally only comments ""That's tuff🔥💯"" on IG  Today is kinda shit on Schroder day around here lol"
You and Dennis Schroder have something in common
Oh shit that’s Dennis Schroder money
"&gt;He did it on ur fucking trash squad  That's exactly my point sherlock.  Even Dennis Schroder could put up similar numbers if he was allowed to jack shit up with impunity.   One thing I'll give credit to Russ for is his amazing rebounding, but that's purely because we lack a dominant big aside from Gafford who developed way late in the season."

&gt;Dennis Schroder  That's tuff 🔥💯
"Sometimes it's better to not bet on yourself , see Dennis Schroder"
It’s Dennis Schroder
"This is Dennis Schroder we're talking about here, Dennis, i'm gonna go into crowds and vlog on rollercoasters without and protection in the middle of the pandemic, while my team is in the playoffs Dennis Schroder, oh no i got Covid Denis Schroder, this Dennis Schroder paying his own insurance?!? C'mon man."
We have one Dennis Schroder available. I'm not gonna shit on the Pelicans. I like Lonzo but he overrated as fuck in this sub.
Hopefully those Dennis Schroder talks are now put to rest.
"&gt;All star types $30 mill.  Dennis Schroder: Hey, that's me"
No body cares. We need a Dennis Schroder update so we can go to bed.
I have this horrifying dream that the Blazers sign-and-trade Norman Powell for Dennis Schroder as part of that deal for Westbrook and I'm really scared
Dennis Schroder crying rn
&gt;BREAKING NEWS: Dennis Schroder has been spotted at a bar with his possy beating up strangers.  west coast bias obviously nba fixed smh my head
BREAKING NEWS: Dennis Schroder has been spotted at a bar with his possy beating up strangers.
Dennis Schroder does not approve
"Where did I say he was a better shooter or defender?  And answer the question? You want essentially shooting guard Schroder to lead NOLA, or a proven playmaking PG? NOLA is gonna have a bad defense regardless or Dennis or Spence, but Schroder is going to ensure that their offense is broken as hell"
Dennis schroder to Nola?!? That’s tuff 🔥🔥💯
&gt; When comparing him to Dennis the only question is the ACL tear. Never said his only concern is his injury.  This is hilarious because Schroder is not anywhere near as bad the shooter or defender Dinwiddie is.  You’re just doing mental gymnastics to defend yourself at this point lol
"A guy making league min can be signed by anyone, and someone like Jeff Green who could be a bench piece on a contender is highly sought after.  Schroder is the better player but with how much money he wants there are just so few teams that are even realistic for him.  If Dennis only wanted like 5 million a year he would be way more sought after than Green"
It's Dennis Schroder time.
"As I've grown older I honestly associate that level of complaining about grammar with a certain level of emotional immaturity. Unless you are submitting some piece of writing to a scientific journal or for publication for an audience that includes a large amount of ESL speakers (who may genuinely be confused by such typos) then there is no reason to care that much about grammar if you can tell what the person means.  If I say ""Dennis Schroder ain't good, he don't handle the ball well"" then a competent English speaker should easily be able to tell what I mean, even without the umlaut, and with the improper grammatical use of ""ain't"" and ""don't"".  If someone acts like they really cant figure that out then it tells me that they intentionally misinterpret things so that they can feel ""right"", and that I should try to avoid talking to them if I can because they are going to be annoying about simple grammatical mistakes that all people make from time to time, but which don't actively have a deleterious impact on communication."
Kawhi Leonard plans turn into Kyle Lowry plans that turn into Goran Dragic plans but end up ultimately just resulting in Kelly Oubre and Dennis Schroder for a combined $35 mil APY plans.
"If you thought Ben Simmons was whiny at Jimmy Buckets running the Philly offense, then it's going to be off the charts with Dennis Schroder."
all day. folks out here really trying to spin Dennis Schroder was somehow a better fit than Westbrook. These talking heads are crazy as hell for this foolishness lol
"Lakers be like ""yo you liking Dennis Schroder now???!"""
"It directs you to a NY Post article published today by Marc Berman about the Knicks free agency plans. Literally in the article:  &gt; The most likely Knicks catch would be Lakers point guard Dennis Schroder, a solid defender and playmaker who may be expendable now that the Lakers have landed Russell Westbrook. The Knicks scouted Schroder intensely this season to make sure the German native is a fit for coach Tom Thibodeau."

Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K
"Young talent wants to make a name for themselves and earn big contracts (Dion Waiters, Dennis Schroder), vets are committed all to winning."
You're right they should give 25 million a year to Dennis Schroder instead.
"Dennis Schroder be like ""what about me"""
"Lakers: ""No, you love Dennis Schroder and you want to acquire him"""
"Evan ""Dennis Schroder"" Fournier"
"So Baynes and Hood for the Wizards? I guess it make sense for the Raptors to have both of them in the trading block, but maybe trading them to make room for a long-term deal for Schroder it's questionable. The Wizards 'giving' Harrell and Kuzma for those two would be questionable too. In this case definetly feels like the Wizards would need something more and i wouldn't be so sure Toronto would be willing to do it for the sake of getting Dennis - at this point just deal Siakam and rebuild."
Zach Lowe and Bobby Mark said they can't do a one-for-one when it comes to free agency. They can only take assets from another team in a sign-and-trade with Dennis Schroder. They can't sign in trade Dennis and also the other team sign-and-trade Damar.
Dennis Schroder would be a great fit for the Knicks! :) ^pls
"Move aside Dennis Schroder, OKC wants to overpay its next bench rotation player"
Don't worry you guys can have Dennis Schroder
"Dw you'll get to enjoy Dennis ""That's Tuff 🔥💯"" Schroder instead because also in that article:  &gt; The Knicks are mentioned by league sources as a team that has expressed interest in Fournier, while New York has also been linked to Lakers guards Dennis Schroder and Talen Horton-Tucker."
You will have one slightly used Dennis Schroder and you will like it
"i think the idea is something like kings get kuzma and the new rookie isaiah jackson and 2 future seconds wizards get dennis schroder, montrezl harrel via s&amp;t and kcp lakers get russ and buddy.  at least thats how it would go down if we were to expand this deal   kings getting back kuzma, a fresh center who RIMRUNS and would be a good fit with fox, and 2 future 2nds is a good reasonable haul for buddy in my opinion"
"This sub still seems to think a trade that was centered around the players that got traded for Westbrook is still happening, just with Dennis Schroder instead. Cause the kings DEFINITELY need another PG (that will be voerpaid)."
