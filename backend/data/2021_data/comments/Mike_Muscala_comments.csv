"Lmao. That 2015 wiz squad is probably my favorite. If Wall didn't break his hand that series, Wizards win it, I think.  Also, we blew a 20+ point lead to Shelvin Mack, Mike Scott, and Mike Muscala. Even though Ramon Sessions was our starting PG that game, y'all really should've won that one."

I guess its mike muscala.   Edit- I guess dort is kind of played like a center
How can you just sit there and fucking straight up disrespect Mike Muscala like this
"One of these players is out of the league, and it ain‚Äôt Mike Muscala.."
Mike Muscala has killed us over the years regardless of the team he plays for.
Mike muscala
the disrespect to Mike Muscala
random fact: Mike Muscala beat out CJ McCollum for conference player of the year twice for patriot league conference with both sharing the same four years in college
"Thaddeus Young played 13 mins and had 3 TOs. Seriously, fuck you and your shit butter fingers Thad. You out tank commandered Mike fucking Muscala.   Also, fuck that foul called on WCJ on that Muscala corner three. They touched hands after the shot. Fucking bull shit."
Mike Muscala
Mike Muscala is arguably the best player in the NBA
Mike Muscala
seeing mike muscala still annoys me man.. we really traded zu for this dude lmao
"Mike Muscala recently acquired his 3rd home, built from the bricks he has diligently laid since entering the NBA in 2013"
Instructions unclear. Mike Muscala somehow decided to shoot 42% from three on 5 attempts per game.
Oh I know. I also swear he‚Äôs gonna be a mike muscala situation where I never once see him make a 3 and then look at his stats at the end of the year and he shot 35%
Mike Muscala
"Ye 3 point specialist , Mike 'fucking' Muscala"
"Mike Muscala lol, unironically."
Thunder: trade Mike Muscala for KD
Mike muscala? Okc doesn‚Äôt work well with this lol
"Mike muscala for MVP AND most improved? Damn man chill, let some awards for others"
Mike Muscala
Done deal. We will give second rounders too as compensatory draft capital. Will also throw in Goat shooter  Mike Muscala too.
"Topped the career highs of two certain Sixers 1st overall picks.  If I ever meet Mike Muscala, I'm buying him a beer."
Thank you Mike Muscala for getting that pick conveyed and thank you Elton for making your only good trade and getting Maxey for Fultz
Thank you so much Mike Muscala
This game has me graciously thanking former Sixers legend Mike Muscala...
I just want to say it again:  Thank you Mike Muscala.
Thank fuck for Mike Muscala too
"Rookie from the draft, we got the pick because of a Mike Muscala buzzer beater on OKC"
Mike Muscala has 2 this year. Could be something to watch üëÄ
"It's funny, because they traded for almost every one of the guys you just listed.  Lou: CP3 trade  Jackson: Was waived and not many other teams were showing interest.   Kennard: Shamet and draft compensation. Shamet was from the Tobias trade and they got Tobias from Blake Griffin who they drafted and extended  Morris: Harkless (who doesn't get many minutes at this point in his career) and draft compensation. They also signed him to an extension that I think only a handful of teams would be willing to give to him  Zubac: Traded for Mike Muscala who they got from the Sixers in the Tobias trade from once again Blake Griffin."
"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."
This sub started having people use initials or acronyms as nicknames that are not widely known.  MM? Marcus morris? Markieff morris? Monta Morris? Mike Muscala? Who the fuck knows? But they expect you to know who they're talking about
You ever heard of Mike Muscala?
You know Jaxson Hayes is bad when Mike Muscala goes on a run against you.
Mike ‚ÄúFuck The Tank‚Äù Muscala
it‚Äôs understandable when we have the best shooter of all time in mike muscala
Mike Muscala doesn‚Äôt want Cade as his teammate next year
"Everyone thought the stretch five that is going to be traded would be Al Horford...  When in reality, it is Mike ‚ÄúHeat Check‚Äù Muscala"
Mike ‚ÄúCapitol Police‚Äù Muscala
Just a reminder that Magic Johnson traded Zubac AND Mike Beasley for Muscala
Mike Muscala gets a ring if this team gets a chip in the next 3 years.
Mike Muscala is only 29?!?!? I thought this dude was like 35 and also out of the league
Mike Muscala tries to block every dunk and his success rate is like 1/800. Idk why he keeps trying
"How dare you, Mike muscala is a saint!"
Lakers legend mike muscala
Mike Muscala is getting a ring
Thank you Mike Muscala
Ah clipper legend Mike muscala
don't forget the shit stains magic left behind for others to clean up.  that mike muscala trade two years ago. jesus.

Might as well add Trevor Ariza and Mike Muscala for okc
Don't forget the GOAT Mike Muscala

MIKE MUSCALAüòÇ
Mike Muscala is basically the same thing tbh
Mike Muscala.
Next thing u know Mike Muscala is a top ten center in the league
Mike muscala
Sixers made 4 trades at the deadline 2 years ago  Chandler Shamet Muscala and picks for Tobias Boban and Mike Scott  2nd for James Ennis and 2nd  Fultz for 1st 2nd and Jonathan Simmons  Cash for Malachi Richardson (who they ended up waiving) and a 2nd  Not super huge moves other than the Tobi deal but Scott Boban and Ennis were good role players on our bench that helped us in the playoffs and we got maxey from the fultz trade because Muscala hit a 3 for another team so basically time is a flat circle
Zubac and a 2nd for Mike Muscala. Thanks Magic! üò°
Mike Muscala is still better than him  I miss Zu
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"Danny green, mike Scott, Maxey, and Porier for Lowry. Could also throw mike Scott to they thunder, tag a pick with it, and get muscala"
"i never said it was a big fuck up or that the lakers should be losing sleep or anything. but zubac is not average, he's good, and giving him up for mike muscala was a bad trade"
Lakers legend Mike Muscala
clipper legend mike muscala
/r/Sixers is basically the Mike Muscala Fanclub
"The Mike Muscala community is toxic as hell, always ranting and screaming about how ""elite"" he is at missing corner 3s."
The Mike Muscala fandom is dying repost if you‚Äôre a true Mike Muscala fan
Mike Muscala or Summer League Isaac Bonga
i don‚Äôt think so.. what about mike muscala?
mike muscala fans are insufferable tbh
"Nah, far too expensive (salary-wise, for matching). Blake‚Äôs an option if he gets bought out, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs too likely.  Nemanja Bjelica, PJ Tucker, and Mike Muscala are all decent backups that can play the 4 or 5, and would be a great fit in Ben-led lineups when Embiid‚Äôs out or off the floor. They‚Äôd effectively be upgrades on Mike Scott, and alternates to Dwight depending on matchups. Any of those 3 guys should likely be available for a second rounder or two, I don‚Äôt think any teams are paying a first for them, and they‚Äôre all definitely on the trading block.  Some higher end options are Thad Young and Larry Nance, less stretch-y (low volume shooters) but better overall players (both guys are having great years). I think these are nice options, but less likely since the cost would be higher, and I don‚Äôt think Cleveland sells on Nance unless they get an offer they really can‚Äôt say no to. I also think there‚Äôs teams that need a guy like Thad more than us too (Celtics, possibly), so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely the right fit."
We had to trade away Clipper legend Mike Muscala
"Great take with Denzel Valentine over Mike Muscala. I know its close, but I 100% agree with you there."
Aye yo Laker nation how about bringing Lakers legend Mike Muscala back to cover for AD being out?? /s
"Bjelica, PJ Tucker, and Mike Muscala should all be available and cheap to acquire.  Those are all guys who can essentially play the 5 (which is what I think we‚Äôd want), but if you want more strictly forwards, Rudy Gay‚Äôs an option too, and there‚Äôs probably some more guys in that vein."
why is that the 18/16 guys are laways 'the worst' and not the Jared Dudleys of the world? I get the effiency argument but do you really think Mike Muscala would have better numbers in the same role? It's not like you can just snap your fingers and be one of the leagues best rebounders.
"Do you think any teams are trading a first for Patty Mills, George Hill, Mike Muscala, or PJ Tucker? Keep in mind, a decent chunk of contenders don‚Äôt even have any firsts to trade for years since they used them to acquire stars (Lakers, Clippers, Nets, Bucks, etc.)  These guys are pretty much all expiring vets on non-contenders. If they‚Äôre not getting traded for 1sts, what do you think those teams are going to take for them?"
(mike muscala??)'s face is hilarious at the end of that
My Mike Muscala post was posted 15 mins ago and still isn't removed :P.
Obviously not the best metric.    Sabonis is 212th.  Nicolas Batum is 20th.    Keldon Johnson (who has been great for SA) is 231ist.  Mike Muscala is tied with Dejounte Murray.  Sexton and Siakam are 80 spots behind Cameron Johnson.  Etc.
im gonna say bring in mike muscala
I didn't even know what Mike Muscala looked liked until today
No one should trade for Mike Muscala.
Blame Magic smh. Zubac for Mike Muscala was the trade I believe ugh
"6 firsts for Mike Muscala is a bit steep, maybe the C's can get away with 5"
I've been following basketball for a long time and I recognize one name on the Thunder and it's Mike Muscala. Wow.
Mike muscala or Darius miller since okc getting gabriel deck
Mike Muscala on 2019 Lakers. Can't believe Magic gift-wrapped Zubac to the clippers for that joker.
Mike Muscala üò©
The immortal Mike Muscala
Joe Ingles is much much better now than back then. If he went back rn he would tear it up. Shane Larkin and Mike James are considered the 2 best players in Euroleague. Muscala definite has a chance to be top 10 there
Name one person on that roster that is better than this years Jazz. Pero Antic?  Kent Bazemore?  Elton Brand?  DeMarre Carroll?  Austin Daye?  Al Horford?  John Jenkins?  Kyle Korver(ILY)?  Shelvin Mack(UPSHELVINS)?  Paul Millsap(ILY2)?  Mike Muscala?  Adreian Payne?  Dennis Schroder?  Mike Scott?  Thabo Sefolosha?  Jeff Teague?
"&gt;The Mike Muscala trade still confuses me. I‚Äôve never heard an explanation for it  They had to dump salary to make room for Davis.  Zubac was also 21 years-old, and swapping him for a veteran for James' presumably short window is not crazy.  That said, if you believe -- like many do -- that spacing is the be-all and end-all of roster construction, swapping Zubac for Muscala makes perfect sense.  I don't subscribe to that theory, myself, but many do."
Thunder:  SGA  Hordford  Dort  Kenny Hustle  Mike Muscala  Darius Bazley  Moses Brown  Isaiah Roby  Theo Meldeon   Why TF can't we tank. Lol.
Mike Muscala is the man. Got us Maxey by making the OKC pick transfer.
fucking mike muscala
The Mike Muscala trade still confuses me. I‚Äôve never heard an explanation for it
"Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala. Even though it's been 2 years, really Magic???"
"As a Thunder fan I am contractually obligated to argue for Sam Presti. He has the most difficult GM job in the league. Building a sustainable contender in freaking Oklahoma should be impossible. He essentially has no access to the free agent market. He had to show up on Mike Muscala's doorstep in Minnesota at midnight when free agency started to persuade him to sign. *Mike Muscala*.   Yeah, he fucked up trading Harden (because the owners made him), and he lost KD for nothing (because KD is a snake), but what other GM could rebound from those losses as well as Presti? The year after the Harden trade his team was a #1 seed title favorite entering the playoffs. One year after losing KD he replaced him with Paul George when folks thought OKC's assets were tapped out, and when PG asked out, he pivoted and put together the biggest collection of draft assets in league history (and acquired a new foundational star in SGA).   He's had some rough draft picks...but he's also had the best run of draft success in NBA history. He didn't put enough quality role players around KD and Russ...but now every player he puts on the roster seems to turn into gold.   Presti is and always has been OKC's best asset. There are other guys who can rightfully be called the best GM in the league over him because of their success in winning titles, but I'd take Presti over anyone."
Mike Muscala
"Imagine being Mike Muscala, unironically being one of the best players on your team still available and your coach sits you every single game for worse players who stink it up"
We could have provided (1) Mike Muscala and (1) Al Horford
Daryl needs to call our pals in OKC about buying out Mike Muscala.
I unironically hope Mike Muscala gets bought out and we can sign him. Would actually be a really good fit on the roster and we wouldn't have to run ben/dwight lineups so much.
How about Mike Muscala.
"We just have terrible luck in drafting bigs, only Horford, Collins, and Mike Scott that one playoff series against the Pacers have came up big for us in the last decade. Adrian Payne, Bebe, Walter Traveles, and Mike Muscala all had something that look good on paper but on court..."
Unprotect the pick and you can have one lightly-used George Hill and Mike Muscala.
Mike Muscala in shambles
&gt; btw that 1st in the Jerami Grant trade almost definitely became Tyrese Maxcy.  God bless Mike Muscala
"* Tobias is still here and he's been very productive. Maybe he's not worth his contract but he and Mike Scott was ABSOLUTELY worth: Chandler, Muscala(Who then got us a draft pick by winning a game late), Shamet, and the picks * Jimmy Butler: Gave up Dario and Cov for a half season of Jimmy. We then got Josh Richardson, who we then turned into Curry. This is basically a wash"
"According to Basketball Reference, Mike Muscala signed his contract July 9th, 2019, and SGA was traded July 10th, 2019.   Mike Muscala is now the longest tenured OKC player by one day."
"That's because Andre Drummond isn't even in the same universe of players as AD. It's not just about benching a healthy player (no one's going to bat an eye if a team benches a healthy Mike Muscala), the caliber of the player obviously has to be considered. Cavs are probably better off not playing Drummond, but the Pels benching an all-NBA player in AD would be akin to blatant tanking. That being said, the AD situation was mostly him being an unprofessional child."
He‚Äôs not really a good NBA player but he clearly can shoot the ball from deep.  Slightly worse Mike Muscala
Mike Muscala hit the game-winning three in the bubble that pushed a top 20 protected 1st from 20 to 21 which got us Maxey. Sixers legend forever.

"Every so often I feel sad the Spurs missed in the 2013 Draft, but then I remember there literally wasn't a player available that would've been anything special. The best player to go after Gobert was Mike Muscala. Feels bad"
he can be a mike muscala but worse defense and worse shooter
Malik Monk  Monte Morris  Marcus Morris  Markieff Morris  Mike Muscala
ok so like 5 years ago we had a mike muscala ama on the hawks subreddit and some german fan wanted to ask him about his go-to basketball move which got misinterpreted as and got asked as go-to movie. since then on every NBA related AMA hawks fans posts this question to try to get it answered as a silly in-joke.
"Of course they do what are you even talking about lmao. Moses Brown, Poku, Svi, Mike Muscala, and maybe you've heard of Al Horford. There's more NBA quality players than roster spots sure but the majority go overseas."
"How do you expect to win without former Sixers Legends Mike Muscala, Tony Bradley and Al Horford ?"
"Keinrich Williams, Mike muscala and a 2nd"
"We receive: Chris Boucher and Khem Birch  You receive: Mike Muscala  Reasoning: we need more Canadians, you guys already get to play in Canada. It‚Äôs a win-win."
Euroleague isn't a 1 to 1 translation because of different style of play and overall fit. Shane Larkin is better than a lot of other NBA guards skill-wise but teams would rather take some 6'3 guard just so they're less of a defensive liability.  With that said we do have a pretty good data point to compare to - Nikola Mirotic is one of the top players in the Euroleague and he is still an NBA level player. So how do you compare Mike Muscala to Nikola Mirotic?
Nah I don‚Äôt mind trading him since he‚Äôs replaceable it‚Äôs the return we got back for him. Literally just got Mike Muscala back.
Mike Muscala is doing well tho
One Mike Muscala please.
Put some respect on Laker great Mike Muscala
Wonder where Mike Muscala is rn
your daily reminder that the Lakers traded Zubac for Mike Muscala
I still can't believe he was traded from us for Mike Muscala. smh....
still can't fucking believe we traded Zubac for Mike fucking Muscala
"as happy as I am with the current reality, I always think about if we retained all our draft gems over the past few years like JC.  Or at least didn't trade Zubac for fucking Mike Muscala lol"
Mike Muscala is infinitely better
[John Collins with 6 fouls. 8 points in 35min. I don‚Äôt even have anything against him but I cannot believe Hawks fans were tweeting us his lowlights against Mike Muscala lmfao ](https://twitter.com/dmay706/status/1402449431648247808?s=21)
Lakers great Mike Muscala
Al Horford and Mike Muscala? KP will net a return lol
Imagine trading Porzingis for Al Horford and Mike Muscala
Porzingis is just a 7‚Äô3 Mike Muscala
"Magic traded for Mike Muscala and walked when the job got hard.  Dennis has a lot of flaws no doubt. His game is limited. He does need to be humbled, and I think this loss, and bad overall performance is exactly what he needed for that.  In that late rally, he was the spark that ignited it. He played stout D and applied immense pressure that helped rally the team.   But he honestly isn‚Äôt to blame for not being able to show up in that situation. He gets paid to penetrate and in this series our shooting was so bad the Suns packed the paint on him and Bron.  If Bron struggled to get in the paint and covert why would we expect Dennis to even stand a chance? This guy is a role player. He has a star ego but this situation will humble him. He tried to back his bark up with bite and couldn‚Äôt and he‚Äôll be better for it.  Plus, who the fuck are we gonna pick up for a vet min that‚Äôs gonna replace him magic? Mike Muscala?"
Says the guy who traded for Mike Muscala lol
the Lakers trading him for Mike Muscala was a low key very dopey move
Thank you Mike Muscala.
Mike muscala might be my favorite sixer of all time
Mike Muscala has to ring the bell for us someday.
Build a statue of Mike Muscala outside Wells Fargo
"They'll definitely regret trading Zubac for Mike Muscala.  They shouldn't regret losing players in exchange for AD, they won a ring. The point of the game is to win championships."
How dare you forget javale McGee and mid season acquisition mike muscala
"Thanks Mike Muscala, we are so grateful for your service"
"Maybe he has a point, but I also think some of what he said is just so hard to apply to the NBA landscape because of how few American-born white players there are.   I went through and did a cursory count, and I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs only something like 30-35 white American-born players in the NBA (it gets a little iffy when you‚Äôre talking about someone like Sabonis who is technically white and American born, but also could easily be considered Lithuanian due to his parents). On top of that, the overwhelming majority aren‚Äôt particularly high-profile. Something tells me Rich Paul isn‚Äôt coming up with personalized pitches for Mike Muscala, Garrison Matthews, and Sam Merrill. So really, you‚Äôre probably looking at a dozen guys who are white, American-born, and high-profile-ish. At that point, the sample size is so small it‚Äôs pretty hard to say. Especially since the majority of agents are white (which is likely the bigger problem), which simply means statistically a white player is more likely going to go with a white agent.   I do agree that players, especially white players, are likely to go with same race agents. Some of that is probably related to implicit biases. Some of it is simply due to a tendency to gravitate toward the familiar (the same way the LeBron connected with and gravitated to Rich Paul)."
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Mike Muscala.
Mike Muscala is a free agent this off season.
Thanks Mike Muscala!
"LeBron: ‚Äú... boy, I really wish we could get Mike Muscala back...‚Äù"
"Yes, and I certainly think he is much more likely to be a max-level player than a Mike Muscala-level player lol"
Do you think he will come back worth that contract or anywhere near it?  Because that‚Äôs the question. He comes back and is Mike Muscala and the Warriors are fucked for years.
AD is a bum.  Can't believe the Lakers chose AD over prime Mike Muscala
What player have you seen recover from both those injuries in two consecutive years be fine?  And I don‚Äôt know what you mean with his game doesn‚Äôt rely on athleticism. He isn‚Äôt Mike Muscala.
You came back after two years just to see Mike Muscala cry?
"Jaylen Hoard, Svi Mykhailiuk, Tony Bradley, and Mike Muscala are all players I‚Äôm preparing to leave the Thunder. There might be a couple trades involving moving Horford and/or possibly Vasilije Micic but I would want to keep him is given the choice."
According to Magic:  Mike Muscala &gt;&gt;&gt; Ivica Zubac
"If you listen to my jackass Celtics fan brother, OKC has a mansion in Manitoba where they send all their ‚Äúinjured‚Äù/shutdown players. First it was just Shai and Lu, now Al is there chilling with Mike Muscala"
Clippers - zubac - trade from lakers for mike muscala
THANK YOU MIKE MUSCALA
"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"
Exactly right. It's like saying trading Zubac for Mike Muscala on an expiring contract was a good move because the Lakers ended up winning a ring the next season.
"Timberwolves:  Chet, Mike Muscala Gary Trent, Jalen Suggs, Tyus Jones"
They should‚Äôve gone for Mike Muscala instead
"But look how trash Mike Muscala is.    Zubac is was a pivotal piece to a championship caliber team, Muscala couldn't get minutes on a tanking team. That's not even counting their impacts on the court."
"If former (strongly disliked) sixer Mike Muscala doesn‚Äôt hit a game winner for OKC in a meaningless last game in the 2019-2020 season, the Sixers don‚Äôt get their first round pick who turned out to be promising PG Tyrese Maxey. Muscala is now a hero to us sixers fans."
&gt; Woj breaks that Mike Muscala   Whoa holy hell! Big if true!
"If people were actually aware of the business and what happens behind the scenes to get WojBombs it would be talked about far differently and not glamorized the way it is. It's an engrained part of NBA culture now, millions of fans F5'ing during any transaction season and freaking out when Woj breaks that Mike Muscala has been traded for cash considerations or whatever. If people actually knew what was going on and that this fetishizing of Woj Bombs is just helping to enable and maintain the current power structure between Woj/agents/manipulative FO executives, general F5 culture would be far different. Would plenty of people still do it yes, but the tone around it and how it's talked about would change alot.   NBA in general has been able to manipulate fan's desire to be arm chair GM perfectly at a number of levels."
Mike Muscala better
"The Zubac trade was so dumb, trading a young promising center for a couple months of Mike Muscala"
Yeah Magic totally manipulated the media and pumped up his value to commit grand theft auto in a trade for Mike Muscala.
"Wait, did the Clippers trade Mike muscala away twice?"
Hey you can't miss any opportunities to get the GOAT Mike Muscala /s
"Disagree, the move still made no sense at all lol. They thought they'd ""sell high"" and get a ""shooter"" for a playoff run on a player we could have re signed if we actually wanted to.... but Muscala was not a shooter at all and we missed the playoffs badly. Even if we were certainly not going to re-sign him, they absolutely could have done better then sending him to the clippers for nothing except Mike Muscala"
i mostly remember him because the lakers traded him for mike muscala and he has been solid since he went to the clips. respect his game a lot.
Still can‚Äôt believe Magic traded him to the Clippers for Mike Muscala. D‚Äôoh!!!ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Lmao Magic really traded this guy for Mike Muscala
They got Sixers legend Mike Muscala too.
You mean you don't miss the almighty Mike Muscala?
Did we really trade Zubac for Mike Muscala? Jesus christ.
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
Right lol. Zu isn‚Äôt anything special but he‚Äôs a serviceable roleplayer. He isn‚Äôt fucking Mike Muscala. Just an awful decision
Because they traded him for mike muscala lmao
"I mean at least he‚Äôs much better than Mike Muscala, wtf was Magic thinking lol"
"He was only here for 2.5 years.    All his picks had value and would have been traded for more value if allowed.  Some were.     Draft 1 Noel - consensus #1.    BC held onto him too long.  Mostly due to elective surgery Nerlens got   MCW- traded for future pick, Mikal Bridges.  Again, subsequent GM couldn‚Äôt convert the layup and just take the hometown kid  Draft 2   Embiid - MVP candidate  Dario- half of Butler trade.  Again future GM messed it up.    Also picked up an extra 1st which was later Shamet.  Who also was pissed away by Brand in Tobi deal.   And also selected Jerami grant who in Bryan Colangelo first move was traded for ersan.     Year 3   Okafor - was traded to Boston for the Jaylen brown pick.  Newly installed Advisor Jerry Colangelo cancelled.   Bunch of 2s- one of which was Richaun Holmes who was later given away in a cash dump so we could compete a trade for Mike Muscala  It wasn‚Äôt perfect.    But a lot of the mistakes were bc of subsequent GMs.    Put another way, Embiid, Dario, Grant and Holmes isn‚Äôt a bad haul for 3 drafts.  Plus UD free agents RoCo and TJ.    If he was allowed to complete the Jaylen trade bad if brown didn‚Äôt fuck up Bridges it would be even better.  But those are out of his control."
"Of the assets that Hinkie acquired:  Covington, Saric, Jerami Grant, 2018 1st (from MCW trade, Mikal Bridges), 2018 1st (from Elfrid Payton trade, Shamet), 2019 1st (from Nik Stauskas trade)  were in part turned into  Butler (gone)  Harris (who was then given a max deal)  Maxey (who ironically enough the Sixers traded the pick earlier for some euro guy who never panned out and only got it back in the Fultz dump)  Mike Muscala (who helped them get the pick that turned into Maxey by making a game winning shot while he was with OKC)  Also, I think technically the pick the Sixers gained from the Bridges-for-Zhaire Smith trade was in the Tobias Harris trade, and LAC traded it to OKC in the PG13 trade."
Shoutout my man Mike Muscala
Thank you Mike Muscala and the Thunder last year/CP3 for allowing this pick to convey. Literally changed our franchise
"If it weren't for March Madness not happening, I don't think this dude falls anywhere close to the Sixers pick. He would have made himself a name to watch. And Jesus bless Mike Muscala for hitting that meaningless 3 in the bubble and converting the draft pick ‚ù§Ô∏è"
thank you Mike Muscala for going against Sam Presti's wishes and granting us the 21st pick to get this guy
Muscala is a PA legend. Homie was the pride of the Bucknell Bison and then he went and (did terribly) kicked ass for the 6ers. When I played that 1v1 blacktop court mode on 2k19 I always chose Mike bc I live near Bucknell. I also remember people absolutely hating him on here for no good reason smh
"The whole team is underdogs. PG went to Fresno State, Kawhi went to SDSU, Reggie and Batum are on minimum deals after being waived, Bev played in Europe for years before being given a shot in the league, Mann was the 48th pick, Zu got dumped for Mike Muscala. Only guys who were supposed to be who they are are really Luke and Mook"
Tyrese Maxey man. Kid was out of the rotation and played a phenomenal game in the biggest game and mins of the year.    Thank you Mike Muscala
"ben and embiid for kemba, mike muscala and 2 2nd's, who says no? /s"
So‚Ä¶  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don‚Äôt grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don‚Äôt think they will?
"I wouldn't do this if I'm the Lakers. They may have some internal thing about how short the title window is. If you think next year is your last shot, you go for it.  I guess you do S&amp;T Schroeder for Kemba then trade Kuz or Trez as well.   Probably have a third and maybe fourth team involved to take one or both Lakers.  Fuzzy on S&amp;T with multiple team rules.  Pelicans - OKC takes back some package of Adams/Bledsoe and picks for Schroeder.  Knicks - Schroeder into space for picks. Maybe Kuz/Trez for Toppin and Knox. Knicks could just sign Schroeder outright, though.  Dallas - Richardson/Powell/Green for Schroeder.  Or the Thunder keep him until next year's trade deadline. Dennis likes the organization and Mike Muscala (who wants to stay in OKC for some reason) is one of his friends."
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players‚Äô number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"The Thunder were similarly talented to this Atlanta team if you believe CP3 is the caliber of player you say he is.   CP3, Shai, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lu Dort, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazley, Mike Muscala, etc.   vs  Trae, Bogi, Capela, Huerter, Collins, Gallo, Lou Williams, Tony Snell, Okongwu, etc.  Left off Hunter and Reddish since both of them missed almost the entirety of this season and are out currently."
"Now if you had a guy like Mike Muscala, say, then maybe there could be a trade."
Andre Roberson  Mike Muscala  Aron Baynes  Alen Smailagic  Udonis Haslem
Mike Muscala needs his jersey hung in Wells Fargo for getting us Maxey
"A few Laker related ones people always get wrong :  Mike Bibby was not called for a foul when elbowed by Kobe, Doug Christie was.  Kobe in 2001 playoffs did not only go off because he was the 2nd option and ‚Äúevery one triple teamed Shaq‚Äù. In fact, the Lakers were significantly better with Kobe and no Shaq than the opposite.  Similarly, AD didn‚Äôt have an insane playoff run in 2020 because ‚Äúhe was spoonfed by LeBron‚Äù. In fact his scoring volume and efficiency were higher when Bron was on the bench. And the Lakers were good with AD even without LeBron.  It‚Äôs often mentioned in hypothetical posts about ‚Äúwhat if the Lakers had kept their young core‚Äù that we could not have had D-Lo and Kuz because we traded D-Lo for the 27th pick. That‚Äôs technically true but we had the 28th pick from the Lou Williams - Corey Brewer trade and Kuz wasn‚Äôt on the Nets radar so we could have kept D-Lo and almost certainly still picked Kuz at 28. He couldn‚Äôt however trade the 28th for the picks that ended up being Hart and Thomas Bryant.  My biggest one : Magic wasn‚Äôt bad as POBO. He signed LeBron, kept a max slot for that summer and when that didn‚Äôt work he turned around and filled the roster with vets while maintaing cap flexibility for the next summer. There weren‚Äôt many shooters available so he focused on a unique ‚Äúzag while everyone zigs‚Äù approach built on stacking playmakers and it was actually working. Lakers were a top-4 seed through the first 34 games, which historically has a 97% chance of leading to a playoff qualification. Our draft picks under Magic were very good. Lonzo was a no-brainer. Kuz, Hart and Thomas Bryant all picked after 27. Caruso signed to the Summer League team then upgraded to two-way. Then he threw everything he had at the AD trade but Demps seemingly just refused anything. Even the maligned Zubac - Muscala trade was about clearing Zu‚Äôs cap hold to keep maximum space for the 2019 offseason. Magic‚Äôs main fault was that he left right after we‚Äôd missed the playoffs because of a gazillion injuries and before the cap space he cleared and assets he gathered could used to upgrade into a contender. I like Rob Pelinka but his moves that offseason were largely just the logical continuation of what Magic had started."
Mike Muscala. Career 3-point percentage of 36.8% vs. 32.9%. Checkmate.
"At worst case scenario, He'll be a Frank Kaminsky/Mike Muscala where he might get some time in the regular season as a 2nd or 3rd string big   Best case scenario, he improves as a shot blocker and keeps the weight off to be Brook Lopez lite or somewhere in the middle between those options  He has a spot in this league one way or another"
I'll never forgive Mike Muscala
"As a Thunder fan, it‚Äôs definitely Mike Muscala now!"
"Byron Mullens is the worst player I've ever seen have that level of usage on an NBA team. We've seen back up level player like Ish Smith being forced into way too big of a role on a bad team, but Byron Mullens was basically a poor's man Mike Muscala and was out here posting up and doing the Melo iso jab step dance from the elbow for that Charlotte team"
"The Lakers front office utterly blew their rebuild and it didn't matter because Lebron decided to go there and then AD forced his way there.  They drafted Russell #2 and then dumped him for Brook Lopez and the 28th pick (which they got lucky turned into Kuzma who at least was an asset). Then they let Brook Lopez walk for no reason considering he would've been an amazing center to play with Lebron. They traded Zubac (a nice prospect on a rookie deal) for Mike Muscala for ""shooting"" even though that team was going absolutely nowhere that season, and Muscala was gone after that year.  They also took Lonzo over Tatum which in hindsight was a terrible move.  They also let Randle go who turned out to be a really good player.  Everything they did for like 4 years was a bad move and it didn't even matter."
"&gt;Wing players actually shoot the ball  what is Zion Williamson then? what is Giannis?  &gt;Also it's funny seeing sixers fans try to attack me for not knowing about warriors roster construction while simultaneously using Traditional centers to compare favorably to Ben not knowing the warriors usually play Dray at center.  what are you even trying to say? Draymond worked well with both Bogut/Looney, i'm asking why wouldn't it work if you swapped Bogut/Looney with Simmons. that's the point.   he also worked very well with Shaun Livingston by the way who also was a non-shooter from 3 and didn't really provide spacing.   &gt;I did see the numbers with Bogut and Dray. Warriors were BETTER WITHOUT HIM on the floor.  brother Warriors were PLUS TWENTY with that lineup lol? also you accused me of using small sample sizes and you're using an even smaller sample size now?  the slew of evidence (14/15 and 15/16 with Bogut and Livingston, 20/21 with Looney) that Warriors in the Curry era regularly had great success even when you put someone who is also not a floor spacer with Draymond is bunk because what, the difference in +19.99 and +25? alright then.  &gt;Also you still haven't addressed anything about why Simmons is literally a negative without Embiid.  because he doesn't work well with other traditional centers whose only offensive skill is rim running. when he played with Horford without Embiid on the court Sixers were pretty good (+7). even with someone like Mike Muscala who just kinda sorta shoots they didn't get destroyed as badly (-1) and somewhat stayed afloat.  and now you're gonna say ""see Simmons + non-shooter center doesn't work"" which yes, it doesn't, but Draymond while he is a non-shooter, still is a good offensive player with other offensive skills other than being tall and jumping high + more crucially the rest of the Sixers isn't/wasn't the rest of the Warriors. obviously if the Warriors didn't have Curry (and now Klay hopefully) i wouldn't think Draymond and Simmons would work, but they do."
He's going to look great feeding Mike Muscala on the perimeter.
"I‚Äôll say this, the Thunder have had horrible luck with protections so far. They lost their 2020 pick to the Sixers (Tyrese Maxey) bc of Mike Muscala hitting a buzzer beater in a meaningless bubble game. Their top 20 Warriors pick last year became 2 seconds. And their top 5 protected pick swap with Houston with a 50% chance to convey failed in the lottery."
"OKC should throw a minimum his way. They‚Äôve already punted on Sengun, dealt Brown. Barnes can‚Äôt be much worse than Mike Muscala can he?"

High: We resigned Mike Muscala and gave an extension to SGA  Low: I‚Äôm still a bit upset about Sengun but I hope the Wizards unprotected that pick
Mike Muscala is 30 years old and barely good enough to be in the NBA as is while those guys are good young prospects. How is he the long term solution?  Presti clearly plans on trading him later this season if he can rehab his value.
I‚Äôm surprised Mike Muscala is still in the league but not Mike Beasley. I know he shoots 37% from 3 for a big but he seems like a worse version of frank kaminsky or gorgi dieng.
Bucknell University Legend Mike Muscala
We had to shut down Mike freaking Muscala in order to tank last season ü§£
WTF That's Mike Muscala money
Mike muscala still out here getting checks?
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was confused when he didn‚Äôt see Mike Muscala run onto the court moments before tipoff Monday night. Then Shai saw teammate Muscala, who was lagging behind. Shai said one word to Muscala. ""Oklahoma."""
Laker legend Mike Muscala
Never forget the Mike Muscala Zubac trade
Sixers legend Mike Muscala
We got him at the same time as Mike Muscala who overshadowed Bullock‚Äôs struggles
"Mavs fans wanna join our Thunder FA club?  Where we expect nothing and then get hyped for Anthony Morrow, Mike Muscala, and Nerlens Noel signings?"
"Probably Tim Hardaway Jr, Jakob Poetl, Rodney Hood, and Mike Muscala."
"Rob ‚Äúlet‚Äôs surround LeBron with Michael Beasley, Javale McGee, Lance Stephenson, and Rajon Rondo‚Äù Pelinka. Rob ‚Äútrade Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala‚Äù Pelinka. Rob ‚Äúuse full MLE on Montrezl Harrell then get Andre Drummond and promise him a starting spot‚Äù Pelinka.  I remember when Laker fans were crying about him not getting GM of the year in 2020. Please. He signed LeBron who goes wherever he wants, and traded what was probably too much for an All-NBA player who said he only would go to the Lakers and refused to play otherwise.  What‚Äôs he thinking with this move? IDK, circus music?"
Mike muscala is the best player from 28-60 Dennis Schroeder is the best from 15-26 2 great players that are still relevant out of 60.  Thus making it the worst class
Maybe Mike Muscala or Doug McDermott. Idk
Laker Legend Mike Muscala
"Kenrich Williams, Mike Muscala, and 2nd round pick for 17"
Mike muscala /s
the second round turned out pretty bad. most second rounds get a few starter quality/decent back up players who have nice careers. 8 years later only 1 second round player is still on a roster. Mike Muscala
then turned around and traded Zubac for mike muscala
"Magic came out and said his justification for it was that Zubac was going to be gone at the end of the season (Lakers either couldn't or didn't want to pay him) and he wanted some additional shooting around Bron.  But cmon, Mike Muscala? Sure he can shoot but he's a third stringer and may not even be in the league next season."
Met Mike Muscala at a soup kitchen
Mike muscala lived in my building. I found that out when I was on the treadmill and this pair of arms and legs got on the one next to me.
Mike Muscala
"Starting should be:  Giddey (if healthy)  SGA  Dort  Bazley  Favors  Bench: Theo Maledon, Kenrich Williams, Isaiah Roby, Mike Moose Muscala, Poku (probably be starting by season's end)"
"Hey, don't disrespect Mike Muscala. Jokes aside, he's way better than DJ at this point"
It's like a 2k roster when you rather have DJ than someone like Mike Muscala as your 9th player off the bench.
"Either Mike Muscala, Ty Jerome, or Darius Bazley"
not true! we traded him and got the conditional FRP from OKC which turned into Maxey becauuse mike muscala hit a pointless game winning shot in the bubble.
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario ≈†ariƒá and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanoviƒá and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn‚Äôt trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
Basically he's a better Mike Muscala.
OKC would probably trade Mike Muscala or Tony Bradley for a few 2nd rounders the nets have and waive him
"Mike Muscala still is. James Ennis probably will be. That's it though, the 2013 draft was crap. Imagine if Giannis and Gobert at 15 and 27 don't pan out, it may be the worst draft in the modern era if not for them."
Bro if we still had Mike Muscala we probably win against the Raptors.  That‚Äôs how bad Greg Monroe was. And Boban was basically unplayable.
"Not in magnitude, but the Lakers flipping zubac for mike Muscala at the trade deadline of the first doomed Lebron season might‚Äôve had the least chance of success of any trade I‚Äôve ever seen"
Zubac (and Beasley) for Mike Muscala.  Felt like the Lakers gave Zubac away for no reason.
The Lakers traded Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala
He tried dunking on mike Muscala and mike pretty much punched him in the face and it was a no call
I still think that Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala is one of the worst trades.  Not because Zubac is an all time great player or anything but because everyone except the Lakers knew how bad it was and then it turned out pretty much exactly as bad as everyone expected.
Trading Zubac for Mike Muscala I don‚Äôt think dude made one three while playing for us
Mike Muscala shooting like 97% from 3 this season or some shit so far it feels like
"Anyone other than Udonis Haslem or Mike Muscala shouldn't be said, and those two are still stretches."
"If only Ralph Macchio had a big man that wasn't a washed up Favors or Mike Muscala to put out, OKC might win a game this year."
Nobody makes on court decisions out of respect for Mike Muscala. That‚Äôs not a thing.
Dis the guy that Magic traded for....Mike Muscala?
Bro we traded zubac for mike muscala. The Westbrook trade ain‚Äôt that bad.
Eff Mike Muscala for ruining that
where the fuck is Mike Muscala
Fucking Mike Muscala missed like 3 open layups Giddey fed and then hits a damn 3
Mike Muscala blocked the shit out of him and his leg folded up under him.
"The deadliest I would have to say Mike Muscala in terms of shooting. Overall game KAT OR VU. Two player to watch... Roby and Bol Bol.   Obviously Bol Bol cant play many minutes due to his height for safety reasons, but Roby has a chance to really create a whole new style for Centers"
Mike Muscala hitting a meaningless gsme winner which conveyed their first round pick to the sixers instead of 2 2nds.   That pick would be Tyrese Maxey. If not for Maxey the loss of Ben could have this sixers squad really hurting
I thank Mike Muscala every day for giving us Maxey
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
mike muscala is a very good player.
Magic is an idiot for trading this dude for Mike fucking Muscala lmao
mike muscala is the greatest shooter of all time though
"It is a useless stat though, a stat where DeAndre Jordan is better than SGA or Booker or where Mike Muscala and Javale McGee are better than LeBron, PG, KAT and Luka should not be taken serious at all"
Mike Muscala fans eating well tonight. Literally better than Lebron

Mike Muscala literally sat half of last season with us and then signed a 2 year contract because he enjoyed it so much. This is, according to the media, a slap in the face of the NBA.  Apparently tHe rIgHt wAy tO pLaY is to hire clearly bad coaches for multiple seasons, sign bloated contracts, and mishandle your young talent to the point that they publicly force their way out in the 2nd year of their 5 year deals."
TBH I haven‚Äôt looked at his stats. I went more with the fact he is a Vet. Would they sit Mike Muscala?
"There was a meaningless (standing wise) game in the bubble where the thunder made a huge comeback vs the heat (both teams were just playing their bench units in the second half) and Mike Muscala hit a game winning 3 with like 5 seconds left. By doing so it gave the sixers the 21st pick, if the pick landed 1-20 thunder would‚Äôve kept it. Sixers took Maxey at 21"
I've seen Mike Muscala get referenced a few times but I don't know the situation. How did he help you get maxey?
How dare you talk shit about thunder legend Mike Muscala
Thank you Mike muscala
"Once again, shoutout to Mike Muscala for hitting that 3 that made the Maxey pick convey"
Every day I thank god for Mike Muscala and the fact there was no March Madness that year
Great we have Mike Muscala.
"Yeah, OKC looks much better with Mike Muscala on the floor"
Mike Muscala
"straw man - ""an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.""  you said i was acting like lebron wasn't making executive decision. i never said that, you said that because it gave you an argument against me.  so do you think pelinka/buss went to lebron and asked his permission to trade Zubac to the clippers for Mike muscala?  you know the answer and don't act like you don't"
"We gave up Zubac, Randle, and Thomas Bryant for a combined two months of Mike Muscala."
The name is Mike Muscala
"Mike ""despite the win"" Muscala"

Mike (sixers sleeper agent) Muscala.
"He has a ridiculous wingspan, and has effectively used it to finish at the rim well, he's also demonstrated a good overall feel for the game. He's a solid prospect with a fairly high ceiling The Lakers should be willing to trade him, but not for fucking Mike Muscala"
Mike Muscala. Used to get trashed and called the worst player in the league on here and ever since he got to OKC hes been more than Solid. Been pretty clutch too.
I remember the last time lakers traded for Mike muscala üò¨
[would you really look at LeGM in the eye and tell him Mike Muscala is the solution to their problems???](https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/0-750x422.gif)
"Mike Muscala is a good rotation player on a contender, change my view"
"The Mike Muscala game, he was an absolute flame thrower in that 2nd quarter"
Mike Muscala is a bad man and we should guard him
Bucks vs OKC biggest free agent signings who wins. I submit OKCs team. Everybody in prime  Derek Fisher  Caron Butler  Patrick Patterson  Mike Muscala  Nerlens Noel
jalen green's dunk over mike muscala
"Thank you, Mike Muscala"
"How could he when he was faced with the imposing, intimidating interior defensive presence of Mike Muscala?"
You‚Äôre getting a little carried away. This is still the worst team in the league. The fact that Mike Muscala is the 3rd best player is proof enough.  The only thing keeping this team from worst of all time level is SGA.
ADISNEY soft as fuck camping at the 3 point line when Mike fucking Muscala is guarding him wtf
Mike Muscala revenge game.
"It‚Äôs what enables the current power structures where guys like Shams bootlick rich people, allow them to control narratives and help maintain their status/power structures, all in the name of fans freaking out about ‚ÄúMike muscala traded for cash considerations‚Äù or whatever"
Idk about that. Trading Zubac for Mike Muscala was pretty dumb.
Followed it up by trading Zubac for Mike Motherfucking Muscala.
"with apologies to lue dort, not even that hot of a take lol.  here's my hot take: replace mike muscala with a average starter and we're looking at a 35 win team at worst."
"I remember on August 12th, 2020, Mike Muscala sunk two threes in the closing 30 seconds against the Heat to win the game.   This game would be the deciding factor in both OKC and Miami acquiring the 5 seeds for their respective conferences."
"Mike Muscala to Sam Presti after the game, ""I know what you want, I got this"""
"Mike Muscala to Sam Presti after the game, ""I know what you want, I got this""."

Mike muscala single handedly brought us back into the game
Yeah but that doesn‚Äôt mean you trade him for Mike Muscala
"Shit, they coulda hired me for 1/10th the price if all they wanted was to flip zubac for Mike muscala lmfao"
