"Nice! Jalen gonna be great fo sure and I hope he will fit next to Ayton!  Kinda the same situation, we are insanely deep so it's really tough to play everyone. Trey Lyles was supposed to crack into the rotation but he played sooo bad in the Preseason that Pop isn't playing. Drew Eubanks, a G-League and promising role center, isn't seeing his minutes too with LMA playing. Pop is running a 9 Man rotation so it's really difficult but I hope, once White comes back, Pop uses a 10 Man Rotation with Vassell playing a bit.  Good Luck for the SZN! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧"
"He kinda has no choice atm. There is no gleague Luka Samanic, Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, Keita Bapes Diop are all playing like shit and Derrick White is out but of course he has shown that he can be useful."
Drew Eubanks
I hope Drew Eubanks dunks on Kawhi so hard the clippers drop him out of shame
Nah Luka Samanic.  Drew Eubanks has shown he can contribute NBA minutes.
Drew Eubanks
"Did you actually watch the game yesterday? Because this comment pretty much confirms you didn't. DeMar didn't guard Davis, like at all. Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Jakob Poeltl and Drew Eubanks were the primary defenders for him for the entirety of the game.   I'm not disagreeing that DeMar is a bad defender but you sure as hell didn't come to that conclusion by watching the game..."
My claim to fame is that I played against Drew Eubanks in high school lol
Drew Eubanks
Lonnie Walker. Also Drew Eubanks but he barely plays
Drew Eubanks definitely has the worst no doubt
People on here are acting like Drew Eubanks was voted all star starter ahead of Dame. Luka is a brilliant player who was also a starter last year + improved every facet of his game. No need to be disrespectful
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better. They're up to 9th this season for DRTG after being 25th last season.      |||||+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|OnCourt|On-OffV| |1|Jakob Poeltl|26|564|+10.9|+21.1| |2|Rudy Gay|25|552|+9.7|+18.8| |3|Patty Mills|26|661|+7.9|+18.3| |4|Derrick White|7|162|+9.1|+11.2| |5|Devin Vassell|25|444|+4.9|+8.7| |6|Dejounte Murray|26|789|+1.2|+5.0| |7|DeMar DeRozan|24|800|-1.8|-3.1| |9|LaMarcus Aldridge|18|480|-8.2|-12.0| |10|Trey Lyles|14|165|-14.2|-15.5| |11|Keldon Johnson|26|781|-6.8|-16.0| |12|Lonnie Walker|24|647|-8.5|-16.0| |13|Drew Eubanks|10|132|-20.5|-22.2|    Based on these On-Off per 100 possession numbers it seems that the Spurs' success has also been driven more so from their deep bench and role players compared to their veteran starts."
"Well Atlanta’s young as well so we could send some young players. Probably Lonnie and a protected first? If they want a backup big, we have Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, and Luka Samanic (it would hurt to lose Lonnie &amp; Samanic)  If they want veterans for a playoff push, I could see adding expirings from Atlanta and giving Rudy Gay over for added offense and shooting. Idk if they’d WANT Aldridge, but he certainly is available in any capacity.  I’d nix any deal involving DeRozan, Mills, or our other young players, though, and just try and sign him in the offseason.   If Atlanta wants to make a playoff push and need backup shooting, I could see a way we incorporate Rudy Gay to the trade and get expiring back as well. God forbid we"
"if their was more time left we wouldn’t be playing Keita Bates-Diop, Quinndary Weatherspoon, Trey Lyles, Lonnie Walker, and Drew Eubanks if they had a real chance to comeback lol"
"Drew Eubanks on the Spurs a while back, maybe 2 years ago. That was the last time, I’m pretty hardcore into this stuff"
"Last game, Bill Worrell went on about Bob Eubanks and it seemed like Drew spit on him some time in the past because he seemed to really dislike him."
"God they were awful. The play-by-play guy said Ginobili was from Venezuela, he said Eubanks had a career night, ""14 points for 14!"" while Drew only had 8...and the whole rookie thing."
Drew Eubanks is on a one man mission to bring back the skyhook and I love it
"As a Spurs fan, it's frustrating.  We weren't even able to get a second round pick for him, and are now  trotting out Drew Eubanks and Gorgui Deng (who looks like he has never seen a basketball) with our second unit."
Drew Eubanks’ evil cousin Zack
"Tre Lyles, Drew Eubanks, Devin Vassell"
"&gt; As it is, you have an aging team who’s tried to compete for the last four years, and the best they could manage was the 7 seed  This is the youngest roster Pop has ever coached.  We've been rebuilding in place since our franchise player forced his way out, and are plenty happy with how we've drafted and developed players while actually trying to win games.  It's also misleading to ignore how much more difficult it is to advance up the board in the West.  &gt; We drafted an all-star, two very good players, and a number of role players and got to watch them grow.  A little reductive to called Luka Dončić an All Star, honestly.  But seriously, I really do enjoy watching Young play and think he's got clear comparisons to Steve Nash.  It's just bizarre to me that Hawks fans insist on pointing out that the guy they essentially drafted 3rd overall is better than the 29th pick we found at a culinary school.  It's not like Pels fans need to remind everyone that Zion is, in fact, better than Luka Samanić.  &gt; So I’d say Hawks fans are happy w/ the result of the last four years. Can you say the same thing about the Spurs? You enjoy losing those 7 seeds that much?  I can't speak for them, but I somehow doubt the average Hawks fan has enjoyed watching Hawks basketball the past four seasons, if they bother tuning in at all.  Kudos to those who do, but I don't blame anyone for choosing to skip watching a bad team play meaningless games.  As for us, it's great watching our guys develop together and gain real experience in the playoffs.  Watching the steady trajectory of genuinely likable blue-collar guys like Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Luka Samanić, Lonnie Walker IV, Drew Eubanks, and Devin Vassell is a treat.  While I don't think anyone on our current roster can be the centerpiece of a championship roster, they absolutely have the chops to compliment that kind of player."
He got cut and replaced by Drew Eubanks and Jakob Poetl by Gregg Popovic.
"Not necessarily true.  Miami could have put forward a Meyers Leonard/Kelly Olynk package.  Two expirings that weren't giving them much value (Olynk has been pretty bad this year).    Perhaps Miami would want to go for Aldridge as a backup big behind Bam.  Spurs would be happy to get Olynk back for the stretch run, since they were sorely needing any sort of depth in the frontcourt - way too much Drew Eubanks, Trey Lyles, annd Rudy Gay at the center position."
"People not watching games are showing themsevles, Griffin, Aldridge, Drummond just aren't that good, if they were they would've been traded not in the buy out market.  It's flat out not impossible that Gorgui Dieng is better than all 3, and he went to a lower end playoff team, it's not impossible that Markieff Morris provided more in last playoffs then those 3 provide this year and nobody cares about Kieff last year.  Free agents mostly already take pay cut/force trades to the ""richer"", if you wanna say that part is a problem, but please don't use a player that can't move, a player that was getting outplayed by Drew Eubanks and a center with a 50%TS who got traded for John Henson and Brandon Knight one year ago to act like the buy out market is suddenly unfair"
How much help does Drew Eubanks need?
"We need a backup to Jak desperately. If we want to make a playoff push we can't keep playing Drew ""Bob"" Eubanks as the second string center or even worse, Rudy at 5"
"""Mega super team"" 3 all stars is a mega super team ? Or are we including a guy that was getting outplayed by Drew Eubanks most of the year and a 6'9 guy who we are all surprised to see dunk again ?"
Because people look at the names and ignore the fact that a playoff team coached by the best coach of all time prefered to buy him out and have Drew Eubanks as their first rotation big rather than playing LMA
That bad?  Spurs' big man rotation is one of the worst in the league behind Poeltl (Drew Eubanks and Trey Lyles).
Drew Eubanks
"If you win every game +1, that’s an 82-0 record which is better than the 73 win Warriors. That’s why Drew Eubanks is the GOAT"
Yeah but Drew Eubanks +1
Same but Drew Eubanks

"You're leaving out Drew Eubanks. He's currently shooting 100% from three on the season.  But for real, Rudy is shooting better from three this season than Patty, and Devin is up there, too. Patty for sure has the highest volume from three."
"Lmfao and all of them are unfounded and total bullshit. Except for this one.   Zion takes more shots in the paint than *anyone*, **ever**. But he doesn't get officiated that way. He's 10th in the league in free throw rate (that's behind bench players like Drew Eubanks btw). He's behind Trae Young in free throw attempts per game.   And of course you're going to think ""Well every team says all this shit, everybody just wants their best chance of winning"". But it's not like we're all complaining about some little tik tak pussy ass fouls here. Zion is getting absolutely clobbered in the paint on a very consistent basis and just never gets those calls.   Y'all just don't want any other team to have any sort of perceived advantage so you call it bullshit and say it's the same for everyone. But seriously man, go watch some Pelicans games from this year. Zion gets to the line a lot, but it's not nearly proportional to the amount he's actually fouled. And I don't expect him to get *every* single foul call. None of us do, because that's unrealistic and that doesn't happen for anyone. But if it was called at the rate even for other stars he'd be so far ahead of everyone else, because he's **fouled** more than everyone else. Plain and simple. We don't want an unfounded advantage. We just want it to all be fair. If the other team is fouling our guy at a disproportionate rate, then it should be called that way. Why can Harden and Trae Young go out there, shoot 15 threes a game, and get more calls than a guy who is doing historic things in the paint with historic amounts of contact?"

"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
"Man, we have Jakob Poeltl, Luka Samanic, Drew Eubanks next season, I think it's fair to say we are weak at PF/C as much as I freaking love my Spurs."
drew eubanks
"Drew Eubanks is definitely the ""janitor"" of the Spurs right now.  Center who came up through the GLeague to earn himself an NBA contract.   Plays mostly old-school, bruising basketball. Isn't afraid to throw his body around and attack the boards. Throws down some monster jams, but can also step out to about 15-feet.   Has a tendency to get under the skin of his opponents, mostly because they are probably like ""who is this guy and why is he beating me up?""  Drewbanks has been a pleasant surprise in an otherwise underwhelming season for the Spurs. Great story for a hard working guy."
"Yes. Because he went against Drew Eubanks, Rudy Gay and Keldon Johnson lol.    Taking fade away mid ranges (including the potential game winner which he could have easily taken to the rim) is a massive win."
Spurs said fuck drew Eubanks and are just leaving him out there to die
I’m surprised Gorgui Dieng isn’t getting minutes over Drew Eubanks. His defense is solid and can at least attempt a 3. I do like Eubanks though.
Drew Eubanks is the GOAT.

"WTF. Second night of a back to back, with no Derozan, Poetl, or Patty, after weeks of freefalling in the standings against the second best team in the west, and we win by 26  We looked like the Elder Guru from DBZ unlocked our hidden potential right before the game.

Drew Eubanks?
Can we all take a minute to give Oregon State legend Drew Eubanks some credit? Played a great game.
"I do think Pop and the front office have a lot of influence on the Austin Spurs.   They run a very similar system, which is why so many Spurs players have grown up through though the GLeague and had successful careers (Ian Mahinmi, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Drew Eubanks, etc.)  Not at all trying to take anything away from Snyder. He is a great coach and has shown it this year. He paved his own path, and deserves all the respect."
"Someone would take drew Eubanks. He looked decent last year. Spurs would protect Murray; white, Keldon Johnson, walker, Poeltl, Samanic, Tre Jones, and Devin Vassell"
How much help does Drew Eubanks need?!
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Poeltl, Keldon, Lonnie Walker, Vasell, Samanic and because we need an eighth player Drew Eubanks, but that's literally everyone we have under contract for next season  Edit: Swap Drewbanks with Tre Jones, forgot about him"
"It’s not about the scoreboard, it’s about how they looked in that loss. They had zero answer for Anthony Davis, inside or outside.  It’s pretty different than Keldon Johnson, Drew Eubanks, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell all going off at the same ."

"Drew Eubanks is hitting a three from that exact spot, mark my words"
Next year we'll bring Drew Eubanks to fit both quotas
"&gt; They have two spots and need a point guard and rim protection  You're right, let's call Derrick White and Drew Eubanks"
Pop might have an aneurysm but sure he can battle it out with Drew Eubanks for backup center minutes.
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"yeah, I was thinking DeMar DeRozan sign and trade and Drew Eubanks oughta cover it. they might have to throw in a pick or two tho lmao"
"Wouldn't meet the qualifying games played to be recognized.    Otherwise, Joe Harris ain't shit compared to Drew Eubanks and Chris Silva, they shot the 3Ball twice as good as Harris."
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"
"Doug McDermott, Zach Collins, Domantas Sabonis, Drew Eubanks, Kevin Love.  They’re hard working, lunch pail type of guys, with a high basketball IQ."
Oubre for Lonnie Walker and drew Eubanks  pls
"Bryn Forbes, Drew Eubanks, the Coyote."
"This is a list of literally all our bigs: Luka Samanic, Jakob Poeltl, Drew Eubanks  Favors is a good backup 5 and while I like Eubanks, he'll never be more than a third stringer. We're clearly in rebuild mode after drafting an 18 year old with the 12th pick so we should be trying to get as many picks as we can"
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"On the surface, the Spurs would be all over this trade but they are going to have to solve problems with roster spots and cutting Saric, who would be a salary match for Thad, would be difficult because he has 2 years left on his deal. As it is, we are going to have to cut 3, with Aminu and Hutchinson being pretty much goners unless we can use them in a trade as salary filler.   Drew Eubanks is the most expendable, but is super cheap and is a great locker room guy. If we take back Smith and Saric (and cannot offload anyone else) we're going to have to probably cut Saric AND Eubanks.   With Collins out and Luka Samanic being very unproven, all this leaves us thin in the front court behind Jak and Jock Lansdale.   At the end of the day, its a fair trade both ways but it leaves the Spurs with problems to solve with roster construction. Not that you don't do it, but it would be tricky."
Lowest ranked player in the first 150 i can recognize in the NBA is Drew Eubanks
"The lakers commentators are in watchable. They referred to Derrick White as Lonnie White, Lonnie Walker as Lonnie Murray, and Drew Eubanks as Brett"
Drew “Difference Maker” Eubanks has also entered the chat.
"The answer to any and all questions you might have is Josh Primo  Seriously tho I think we can, signing Ayton means we let Poeltl walk/trade him but Drew Eubanks (or Drewbanks for short) is a good backup and between Murray, Primo, White and Keldon we should have a foundation to score from about anywhere and facilitate for Ayton  &gt;But also...what can you guys offer him that another top level team can’t?  More money than anyone but Detroit, and at least we're not Detroit!"

"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."

"Lemme throw in my experiences seeing NBA players up close:  Basically anyone around the 7 ft range (I've seen Drew Eubanks, David Robinson, Alex Len and Dexter Pittman up close), I still cannot comprehend how someone can be that tall, let alone *extremely athletic*  PJ Tucker, Eric Bledsoe and Justin Anderson look like powerlifters more than hoopers, those dudes are chiseled   Trae Young looks exactly how you expect.  Bryn Forbes is insanely short for a NBA player  Rudy Gay is the only person I've seen where their wingspan blew me away, I never saw him as long on TV but apparently he was a 7'3"" wingspan."
"gosh this guy sucks. Lakers, we'll take him off your hands and send you Drew Eubanks in return. you're welcome!"
"I like everyone on our roster. They're not good but there's tons of underdog guys like Bryn who went from undrafted to a reliable sharpshooter in the NBA, Derrick White who started out at a division two college, Drew Eubanks, and Keita who were undrafted and a second rounder that was let go."
"How can you disrespect Drew ""How is this guy still the backup Center"" Eubanks like that?"
I see you and raise you one Drew Eubanks
"Well with Poeltl out for the Spurs they’ve been starting Drew Eubanks who is awful. I’d go him, Bazley, or Killian Hayes"
Dejounte Murray Devin Vassell Keldon Johnson Jakob Poeltl Derek White Joshua Primo Lonnie Walker Either Doug McDermott or Drew Eubanks
"Drew Eubanks has been starting the past 7 games or so and while he shows flashes of athletism at times, he mostly gets abused by anyone somewhat athletic"
I think it's pretty clear Pop doesn't care about winning games at all. We're playing ridiculous lineups like Tre Jones - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker - Devin Vassell - Drew Eubanks in the middle of close games and Thad Young played 4 minutes last night while Drew Eubanks got more than 20 minutes.
"Our bench was awful this game. I don't think Lonnie will be on the spurs next year.  Wish we kept it closer but it's not really the fault of anyone that matters other than Vassell, we got destroyed when Pop played that Tre Jones - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker - Devin Vassell - Drew Eubanks lineup which isn't surprising at all really."
"To the Spurs, and we'll give Drew Eubanks in return as well"
"Don't know what game you watched. They doubled Davis plenty and it cost them at the perimeter.  Their #1 problem was no Jakob Poeltl, who advanced stats paint as the 2nd best defensive big man in the league. Guarding AD with Drew Eubanks is not bueno.  &gt;noticed how they changed super late and saw results?  The only thing that changed is Davis started to cough it up instead of making the right pass. Spurs were maybe a little more aggressive going down the stretch but that was out of necessity."
They won't play a center rotation of Drew Eubanks and Thaddeus Young every night unfortunately.
I didn't even realize this until I looked [this](https://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/The-ace-is-at-home-How-the-Spurs-Drew-Eubanks-15764496.php#photo-20326447) article up but Eubanks knew nothing about basketball until his freshman year of high school. He didn't even understand why sometimes he shot free throws and sometimes he didn't after fouls until after his sophomore year.

Drew Eubanks is shooting 100% from 3 so far with the new ball.  👀
Our starting center is out and we have played small ball all night without a real center  for every minute Drew Eubanks didn't play
Watching Thad Young and Drew Eubanks (no offense) try to replicate what Jak does is so sad
Nope. Drew Eubanks and Jock Landale get his minutes
