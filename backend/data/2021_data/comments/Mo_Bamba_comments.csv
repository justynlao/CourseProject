MO BAMBA!!!
"Magic fans, why does Mo bamba get no PT?"
if magic fans have any shred of hope that mo bamba is an nba player ur probably right cus this is the guy that clifford caged
Honestly dont know why more teams dont put their end of bench prospects to the G-league for reps. Thats how we developed all our players pretty much and even got stanley to start turning it around.  Theres so many players like Dennis smith and Mo bamba who need reps more than anything
I can’t imagine anyone aside from Mo Bamba punching someone on the court while sitting on the bench all game
"Mo Bamba actually been a decent contributor in very limited minutes this season. Scored 7 points in 3 minutes today. This on top of 8 points 4 rebounds in 6 minutes last game, 8 points 4 rebounds against the Bucks in 11 minutes and 12 points 7 rebounds in 13 minutes against the Rockets.  Would be nice to see how he would fare playing 20+ minutes a night."
What happened to Mo Bamba man
"The Nets need a center, so they would be a better team with Mo Bamba instead of James Harden"
I still think the Nets with the few assets they have should trade for Mo Bamba. He would be a good fit on the roster.
Sad part is I seen Sheck Wes get talked about on this sub more than Mo Bamba
"They also play some Mo Bamba and Yonkers, so they are playing bangers from all generations"
Mo Bamba has not averaged more than 16 minutes a game. They aren't giving him the playing time he needs b/c of Vucevic. It's better to just trade him off and not waste his talents.
No Isaac coming off injury might be too slow to play PF and he's best around the rim.  He's a natural center in today's NBA.  Mo Bamba sucks I didn't forget him.
"Yeah the trade is kinda shit. I completely forgot that Mo Bamba existed (I think u did too lol because Isaac at center)? Pelicans are shit this season but they have a pretty high ceiling. If Vic were ever to be traded, Celtics would be a pretty good option. I don’t what you guys would be thought I be honest."
"Yeah.  Fultz (From DC and under contract he's injured so he helps the tank) Fournier (starting 2 guard and expiring)  Mo Bamba, Chuma Okeke and 3 first round picks/swap (Even with Beal we may still be bad if Vuc drops off.)  Wouldn't trade Gordon or Isaac because we need then to have a good defense."
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba just vanished into the shadow realm
No I don’t think I’m taking that step but I think its an interesting thing to consider and I appreciate that OP has brought up this topic because thinking about the way we use words and their implications is important. I also don’t think he was directly correlating it to race has he has said a few times. Just something interesting to think about.   I more meant the Mo Bamba comment was amusing.
"Kevin Knox and Mo Bamba are looking suss as hell too. especially Mo since the Magic already had Vucci Mane.  also funny you mention OG, the Nuggets were planning to draft him in that draft. They had the next pick"
Teams already have plenty of tape on Jarrett Allen so he is already in that overpay territory for his next contract.   Allen has been the Nets starting Center for 3yrs. Before he was traded he was back to starting over DeAndre Jordan. It’s not like he’s this unknown product like Mo Bamba.    He’s a proven 11pts 10reb player at this stage of his career and could develop a jumper but the Nets didn’t prioritize the midrange. They were more interested in Lobs and Blocks. He had a midrange shot in college.   Allen has said over the summer he wants a Clint Capela 5yr/$90m at minimum and that’s when the Nets hit a snag in negotiations to re sign.
Didn’t he also get like COVID like 3 months ago? Could’ve affected his health. I think Mo Bamba didn’t play at the start of the season due to lingering COVID side effects.
"Smh, Mo Bamba and Shimi Shittu never get any love."
Trade for Mo Bamba.
It's not even trash talk when his team wasn't involved.  It was clowning.    How would you feel if Mo Bamba made fun of Joel Embiid for getting eliminated in the playoffs?
realistically? trade Kyrie for Mo Bamba and Terrence Ross  downvote me. my body is ready
Mo Bamba isn't going to solve their problems.
"Yeah, we’ve seen it happen to Mo Bamba, I hope this doesn’t happen anymore"
He can block but that’s it. I’m not sure this is the right move for C for the Nets. I think they should’ve traded for Mo Bamba instead.
"We probably would have still traded for him. Reportedly we were willing to give up almost anything to draft him. Knowing the kings, they'd probably end up with Dennis Smith and Mo Bamba"
Mo Bamba.
"Having an ego does not mean you’re going to be less successful.  Kobe, LeBron, Jordan, Shaq all have huge egos. But they all are great.  Duncan, Steph, Kawhi don’t have big egos. And they all are still great.  Mario Hezonja had a big ego. He sucked.  Mo Bamba was very humble. He has not been good."
"That song is the most famous thing about Mo Bamba, which is kinda sad for his NBA career so far"
mo bamba
"Mo Bamba doesn't have a bunch, but he did get a whole song named after him by his friend."
Yo Magic fans what happened to Mo Bamba?
Mo Bamba and Jaren Jackson Jr for me. I’d tell my friends ‘Rememebr the name Jaren Jackson’ while he was at MSU and now I barely even remember him
"Mo bamba, song hype got me caught up still wishing"
"Aaron Gordon, Mo Bamba, Marvin Bagley"
"I wouldn't expect a whole lot but why are we giving him away? he has some value, both for teams competing for this year and for a team hoping to keep him long-term. i get that he's a flawed player but he does many things very well and would be excellent on almost any contender.  if nothing else we should be able to get a struggling young guy with higher upside. thinking like mo bamba, rodions kurucs, nassir little... just pulled those names outta my ass, not the best examples, but you get the idea."
We should have draft Mo Bamba.
You sound dumb. So Mario Hezonja and Mo Bamba were good draft picks? Fran Vasquez was a good pick? lmao Trading Victor Oladipo for Serge Ibaka and then flipping him for Terrance Ross was a good decision?  Go play in traffic. You whole opinion is idiotic.
"mo bamba completely disappeared, I thought he was injured"
They wanted to trade maybe our best player consistently ever to start Mo Bamba.  Not real fans of the team.  He deserves to retire in Orlando and have his jersey hang up.
wtf happened to mo bamba. is he hurt or did he just completely fall out of the rotation?
"Probably the Magic for me. Vucevic, Gordon, Mo Bamba, Cole Anthony, Fultz (not anymore technically), and like a bunch is the rest of the roster just Disney characters?"
Have you considered Mo Bamba?
mo bamba is not good at basketball really
I thought you had Mo Bamba?
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
Mo Bamba
"&gt; it’s just way harder to evaluate talent in the NFL than it is in the NBA.  Is it, though? The NBA has lots of busts every draft too. For every Josh Rosen there's a Mo Bamba, for every Dwayne Haskins there's a Justin Jackson."
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
Mo Bamba is 100% right
They should trade for Mo Bamba.
"How he gonna do that when all the casual Magic fans wanted him traded for their YoUnG cOrE to develop.  Like you trade a top 40 player to develop Mo Bamba who ain’t shown nothing on O apart from a solid pick and pop 3.   I genuinely think Orlando should maximise this team’s winning potential whilst Vooch is playing at this level; part of that is supreme confidence in the roster’s current pieces of they can plug a few holes. Cole Kelle and JI are FR to me, they might need to move AG/Evan see if they can replace them with a legit star wing who can put them over the top"
Mo Bamba
"Prime Shaq was in LA and he was in bear mode, (carried extra fat and muscle) backing people down. He was a different player in LSU and Orlando, his physique looked something like Mo Bamba, but even faster, stronger, and more athletic. I agree with Bill, he could have lost some fat in prime years, it probably would have helped his feet and the constant injuries he had. KG can't take real world rational criticism, like how 1 ton people on TLC don't believe ""sodie pops"" are unhealthy."
And Mo Bamba for Dwayne fucking Bacon lmao what is this
anybody checked on Mo Bamba ?
"Frank Ntilikina to Orlando for Mo Bamba + 2rp   i love frank but unfortunately don’t see much of a future for him in NY. he can play 1-2 and conceivably the 3 in a small lineup.   Magic have no use for Bamba, Knicks might be able to use him as Mitch lite and trade Noel at the deadline"
"Bro I can’t believe how hyped I was to take Mo Bamba at 5. Getting Luka seemed impossible back then, like he wasn’t even in the conversation"
Smfh missed the Mo Bamba back to back swishes from deep
Mo Bamba and Vucci Mane from 3: 5/11  The rest of the Magic: 3/18
I was at work and couldn’t keep up with the trade rumors on draft night. I was convinced we were taking Mo Bamba and was thoroughly upset about it. Once I saw we got Luka I hugged our bartender out of joy lol
Don't forget Mo Bamba
So Mo Bamba is a bust right?
"Stop, Kings fans are already dead  It’s crazy to think that back in 2018, I was trying to talk myself into WCJ or Mo Bamba cause I didn’t think we could trade up. What a beautiful timeline"

Trade for Mo Bamba.
Mo Bamba
Cole Anthony/Mo Bamba pnr time
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah’s bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson’s doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba got that song
"Mo Bamba, Fultz, Killian Hayes...KOC shitting the bed on draft projections is one of my favorite sources of schadenfreude"
Is KOC good at the whole draft scouting thing?   In the past 3 drafts he’s had:  **Hayes** *#1*  **Tyrell Terry** *#8* (Really not impressed by what he’s shown so far in Dallas)   **Culver** *#3*  **Grant Williams** *#8*  **Mo Bamba** *#3*
"Mo Bamba averaged 4 blocks per 36 mins, was he robbed of DPOY?"
"Yeah but wouldn't you rather have Mo Bamba instead of Jaylen Brown.  I mean Jaylen Brown is an All Star caliber player, but Mo Bamba can be anything.  He can even be an All Star caliber player (If your blindfolded.)"
"Mav weren't gonna pick Trae so they would have Mo Bamba and DSJ as their core  Mavs won no matter what, doesn't mean Hawks lost."
Damn.. what mo bamba been up to since?
mo bamba
Trade for Mo Bamba
"And you think mo bamba is gonna help with that? We need a legitimate big, not a prospect"
"man this is so random but I looked up Mo Bamba on Wiki and then went to Sheck Wes's page  this dude really signed to play for a team in Paris??? He went from making Mo Bamba, being signed to Cactus Jack, featured on a few Travis songs and now playing in the French league?"
"Would Drake have to record a new version of ""Mo Bamba""?"
Stanley Johnson for Mo Bamba straight up

"Aw damn I’ve been loving Sexland sorry my man. I was just doing it off the top of my head, and didn’t think about him because Garland was last year  I studied the hell out of that draft because it was the first time in awhile the Mavs might have a top 3 or so pick. I had done *this* close to talking myself into how Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr would be awesome together lol. Our own Westbrook and Gobert hahaha."
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."

"Way to use a 4 game sample size. Mpj wasn’t as important for the nuggets as Tyler herro was for the heat. Other than dragic, herro was used to generate his own offense more often than not. Mpj was getting catch and shoot 3s from gravity from jokic and Murray. Again I don’t care about size because they play different positions. I don’t think mo bamba is better than Colin sexton because he gets more rebounds. Also completely disregarded the playmaking advantage because it’s embarrassing the disparity in that area. Herro shows high upside as a future playmaker while mpj has shown no signs of being a willing passer. I think the fact herro averaged more minutes is a credit to him and how easily he fits into a system and doesn’t rub coaches or teammates the wrong way. The 30 point games are cool and all in the regular season but in the playoffs herro showed out while mpj was mostly a role player. If you want to say a team can value mpj upside more for his size and scoring then sure but it’s disingenuous to act like herro is not in the conversation as a highly valuable young prospect."
Most Magic fans I talk to have moved their investments in Mo Bamba onto him
mo bamba
Late 2010s but I thought Mo Bamba was gonna be great and that Vucevic would be traded by the deadline
"he’s what I thought mo bamba would be, he’s better and he’s played like 20 games lol"
"i know wiseman is like 7 feet tall but he scores so easily, especially compared to when I watch mo bamba lol"
"Overrated: Mo Bamba dude just isn’t very good. We’re yelling for him to get minutes but when he does he doesn’t help much. He does have his moments and I still believe in him and wish he’d get the back up center minutes, but yeah Mo is confusing.   Underrated: Evan Fournier? He’s been having a pretty solid season and we’ve struggled when he was out finding some perimeter scoring."
It's kinda shocking how bad Mo Bamba still is
"I think Orlando is an even better example at how hard it is to pick outside of the top-2, even if you have a high pick:        2013: Victor Oladipo #2 overall (not bad, but traded him before he broke out)       2014: Aaron Gordon #4 overall         2015: Mario Hezonja #5 overall         2016: Domantas Sabonis #11 overall (traded to OKC)               2017:  Jonathan Isaac #6 overall           2018: Mo Bamba #6 overall"
"&gt; His major problem was that he had practically no offensive game whatsoever, and scouts assumed he could learn one after he was drafted.  And then when he didn't, they turned around and assumed the same things about Willie Cauley-Stein and Mo Bamba."
"""At this stage of his career"" meaning pre-rookie year Mo Bamba was already better than DPOY Gobert lol. The hype was real with Bamba, there should have been more red flags with how out of control a statement like that comes across."
Mo Bamba &gt; Gobert
So that’s what Mo Bamba is doing instead of improving his game. Interesting.
"I know the Spurs dont do inseason trades, but the Spurs and Magic should do a Lonnie Walker for Mo Bamba swap -   I know the perception is that Walker is a significantly better player but that's just because he gets more minutes while contributing less win shares than Bamba. The Spurs get significantly better when he's benched and White/Vassell are the future of the position for the Spurs anyway.  Both teams have position needs for the opposite player with pressure from better players in that position to affect them mentally  I still think Pop could get something out of Bamba defensively and it would allow them to completely put LMA out of the rotation in case they cant find a trade partner for him (start Poeltl with Bamba as a backup)"
Mo bamba is not mo better
I was telling anyone who would listen that Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr was a solid core to build around.
Can't wait until they trade Mo Bamba and he looks good somewhere else
I’d resigned myself to the fact that Mo Bamba was going to be a Mav.
Marc Gasol and Wes Matthews for Mo Bamba
"1. Luka  2. Trae  i think 3-5 is some combo of Ayton/SGA/JJJ based on team fit.  6-12 is  probably some combo of Bridges\^2, MPJ, Sexton, Wendell, and Bagley        Players bumped down:  2) Marvin Bagley  6) Mo Bamba  9) Kevin Knox       Players bumped up:  11) Shai  14) MPJ (just with the knowledge he stayed healthy)  19) Huerter (maybe)  37) Gary Trent  45) Diallo  46) Melton  54) Shake"
Frank Ntilikina - Mo Bamba swap please
Who wants Mo Bamba? Make me an offer.
"No, his value is super low right now. He was always a long term project so it’s in our interest to spend the time trying to turn him into an asset. I would say the earliest possible time for a Mo Bamba trade would be next trade deadline. Given all the shit he’s been through with his body I think they’ll want to give him an offseason to work on his game and come back to stake his claim for being apart of our future. If that doesn’t materialize it’s time to move on. Ideally the magic trade khem birch at the deadline so that mo plays more down the stretch. If he has a decent second half of the season and a summer to work on his game he will become a lot more valuable than he currently is. And if not there’s not much further his value can go down so no downside."
Is anybody buying on Mo Bamba?
JJ Reddick would hold every single person in this thread to zero points unless like Mo Bamba is in here or something.
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
"&gt;it's almost like Norm might be gone next season, and would not be surprised if we just don't bring TD back.  Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he’s playing just isn’t logical. He’s in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  &gt;I was specifically talking about a Lowry trade, give me talent over fit 100%, we are not in win now mode, especially if we are trading Lowry, missing out on Maxey + a first most likely just because Zubac is a center would be the worst thing you could do.   Even then we’re comparing two players who don’t necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  &gt;You can find exactly what Zubac does in the 2nd round of a draft.   The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  &gt;You could go pick up Holmes as a FA. You can just take the salary filler that you get from a Lowry to Sixers trade and go get Mo Bamba or Birch, or Whiteside.  The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Lmao @ Whiteside.  I get our fanbase has a weirdo hate boner for the Clippers because you think they “stole” our players, but taking worse fitting packages and trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird."
"&gt;but he’ll be playing behind FVV and Norm as well as competing for minutes with TD.  it's almost like Norm might be gone next season, and would not be surprised if we just don't bring TD back.  &gt;Tell that to last year’s Sixers. Fit is important, making blanking statements like 100/100 times isn’t logical.  I was specifically talking about a Lowry trade, give me talent over fit 100%, we are not in win now mode, especially if we are trading Lowry, missing out on Maxey + a first most likely just because Zubac is a center would be the worst thing you could do. You can find exactly what Zubac does in the 2nd round of a draft. You could go pick up Holmes as a FA. You can just take the salary filler that you get from a Lowry to Sixers trade and go get Mo Bamba or Birch, or Whiteside."

Live Sheck Wes &gt; Mo Bamba. Don't @ me
I’ll take one mo bamba
"I don’t see that as a flex on Mo Bamba though, it was more of a celebration."
Mo Bamba was so bad tonight in his minutes idgaf what Curry does
Mo Bamba after the block: I got hooooooeeeeeeeeees
"When he isn’t shooting all the time he has the ball he provides nothing.  I hate him, Gary Clark and Mo Bamba.  If they were gone from the team I’d sleep a little easier at night as a Magic fan.  I’m sure they are all great people but as player they make me go bald."
"I clown our FO for being bad at drafting but if you ignore the Mo Bamba pick which is a fireable offense for any FO than they’ve been really great.  Chuma and Cole both look awesome.  Chuma is awesome on defense, my only problem is he’s too passive.  His shot looks good he needs to fire away more.  Also Vuc for All Star."
Man I though Mo Bamba was gonna be the shit when he came into the league
How is Mo Bamba.?  Like what are his strengths?
james wiseman is already better than mo bamba
Mo bamba
I’m sensing a trend among Texas Longhorn big men... Quick! Someone find something quirky about Mo Bamba
I’ve met several NBA players over the years and Mo Bamba before the draft was super cool we chopped it up for a few minutes.
Marvin Bagley and Mo Bamba were top 6
"That’s not happening lmao, also Mo Bamba wouldn’t help y’all lol he’s too raw"
Imma be honest. I forgot Mo Bamba existed
"r/nba, apparently there is some buzz around Mo Bamba and the Lakers might be a potential suitor according to r/Lakers... thoughts?"
"Mo Bamba has basically the same measurables and struggles to see the floor. Rudy has fantastic reaction time, and is an extraordinarily smart defender. Defense requires a lot more BBIQ than most fans seem to think"
"Nobody that moves the needle much. Some names ive though of are Mo Bamba, Jaxson Hayes and Zubac"
Hope both parties are still motivated and Mo Bamba can develop into a dominant defensive presence. Always love watching good defense
"Lol.  I think that’s what they’re trying to replicate with Mo Bamba, just hasn’t panned out yet. He’s not explosive, but he could potentially be a dominant rebounder and defender."
Imagine this roster woth Haliburton instead of Toppin.  Hindsight being 20 20 but Mitchell and Randle are so good I feel like Topin is just gonna look like the next Mo Bamba.
Yeah all of this fade for Cade thing is gonna look real dumb when we end up with the sixth pick and take another big man.  This FO isn’t even that great at drafting.  Don’t know why they would have confidence in the FO that drafted Mo freaking Bamba over SGA and Michael Porter.
Mo Bamba looking decent is gonna have Magic fans losing their minds if he gets cut from the rotation
One in the hand is worth two in the bush. I agree. Chet especially could bust really hard. He's like Mo Bamba.
Herro ripping off Mo Bamba now
You test positive with the PCR test if the virus is active. Once the virus is gone it may have already damaged core organs. If you need high profile proof of this check out Mo Bamba or the running back from Jacksonville
"SMH calling mo bamba a tiktok song, acting like Sheck Wes isn’t the greatest rapper of our time."
Mo Bamba wasn't eligible for an extension and isn't expiring. The Magic exercised his 4th year option for next season.
"Counter-point: Malik Monk for Bamba, straight-up. Monk's contract is up and Borrego's never been a fan of him even with the improved performance. Even if Mo doesn't break out, it's not a huge gamble for us."
"And DJ Augustin, Myles Turner, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, and Tristan Thompson."
"Khem Birch, the C getting minutes over Bamba, seems like a more reasonable trade target. Actually somewhat proven and has good hustle and D.  I think him getting moved it's the only path to Mo minutes. But good luck moving any healthy body on this team."
"I think Lowry/FVV-Bamba picks would be lethal, but Pascal really needs the paint space. Mo shoots 32% on 1.6 for his career from deep."
There's no real flexibility until Kemba is off the books. We're handcuffed into mediocrity because of that signing. I love Kemba but he's a defensive liability and a knee injury waiting to happen.   The Cs best bet is to find a bigger pass first defensive pg like Rubio or Ball and a 3&amp;D big/wing (because they are so easy to find...) then let Kemba run the second unit or be that spark plug off the bench.    I keep saying this but I want the Cs to pursue Mo Bamba &amp; Lonzo Ball then let them play and grow with Tatum and Brown. Hope Langford gets healthy &amp; give Nesmith &amp; Rob Williams as much playing time as possible so we can tackle a ship next year.  We should be aware that Semi and Theis are both free agents after this season and I don't know if the Cs will be able to re-sign either.
"He has a combination of solid numbers but looking like a baby deer learning to walk. I’m curious if his weight gain/bulking will help him any, we haven’t seen much of him.  Part of me wants him because I believe in his upside, but the rational side of me knows the last thing we should do as playoff contenders is trade for Mo Bamba."
"Plumlee would be the best fit for the Lakers I think. I love his energy and physicality. Plus then we would not have to play against him any more, dude always kills us.   After that I might take a flyer on Mo Bamba if the price is right."
"Mo Bamba would be a huge gamble for any team. I wouldn’t want to be the team that does it, but I am curious to see if he can be a positive contributor in a different situation. As of now I’m pretty convinced he’s just a bad basketball player"
Mo Bamba is the guy I want. I think he could be had for 2 second round picks and he has a lot of upside
Is Mo Bamba playing? He was still not fully recovered by the time the bubble was formed in Orlando last year
"Mo Bamba, Kris Dunn, Markelle Fultz"
"Orlando running an 8 man rotation of Vucevic, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, Mo Bamba, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Chuma Okeke, and Khem Birch..."

"True, you guys should consider picking up mo bamba. You could probably get him for cheap. Low risk high reward type of deal"
"What do Magic fans think of Mo Bamba? Does he have the potential but isn't getting playing time for some reason, or is he just bad?"
"I think this would be really short sighted.   Are we better for trading Rozier away for Kemba?   Our young guys have mostly shown promise but they need real game time to grow. I say use this year to prepare for next year. As soon as Langford is healthy he should be playing 20+ min. Nesmith should be playing 20+ minutes now. Rob Williams should be playing 20+ min. Anyone we can't, or aren't likely to, re-sign should be traded for youth with potential, like Mo Bamba.  Just please don't start trading the young guys with potential for another Kyrie or Kemba... that is a surefire way to get Tatum and Brown to leave as soon they can.  Let the team grow, stop wasting minutes on Thompson and Teague."
MO BAMBA! Idk wtf Clifford is doing but he needs to go to a team that will actually play him.
The song is Mo Bamba by Sheck Wes
Mo Bamba song get me pump though
Mo Bamba
"Aaron Gordon; Wil Barton, Hartenstein, 2021 2nd rnd pick, 2022 2nd rnd pick for Aaron Gordon + Mo Bamba."
"NBAPA gotta buckle down and realise that until everyone got both the vaccines shots, another bubble is the best option for the season. Long-term effects of Covid could be devastating. Imagine if LeBron or some shit gets it and his lungs ain't the same for another season and a half. That's basically the rest of his championship window. Can be real tough for big men who already struggle maintaining motor on both ends of the floor with all the energy they spend moving that mass. Took Mo Bamba months to get back his lungs."
"6'9 with 6'11 wingspan. Nowhere close to longboi. That s like below average for NBA standards. Freakish wingspans are like Mo Bamba, Rondo and Gobert."
Clifford seems to be a decent coach although he gets hate for not playing Mo Bamba more minutes lol
I really hate the Mo Bamba pick.  If we are in the lottery again I hope we don’t waste it on another talentless long arm player.  That was a franchise altering bad decision.
"I think both Mo Bamba and Whiteside could be deadline trade targets. Neither are especially good but so many teams are weak at C that just having a body there is an upgrade, even if that body ball watches on defense or is a freak athlete with little basketball ability."
"Meanwhile Mavs fans who have been around for a while realize when, before we were able to trade up for Luka, we were like “Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Mo Bamba is a pretty solid core for the team, right”"
Free Mo Bamba
"People will see this, and automatically talk about Steph, but it’s absolutely crazy the injury bug the Magic have had so far this year. Right now, we are missing out of our starters.  PG - Fultz (Season) SG - Fournier  SF - Isaac (Season) PF - Gordon (6 weeks)  After that, we’re missing   PF2 - Aminu PG2 - Anthony PG3 - MCW PG4 - Frank Mason  Chums Okeke, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, etc have all missed time as well.  It’s just so demoralizing starting the season off so well, just to have it explode after nearly every starter and backup is injured"
Mo Bamba and Frank Mason played a combined 11 minutes.
Mo Bamba doesn't have the genes to stay healthy
"because every scrub with some social media hype gets better cards than some of the established stars... isak bonga, mo bamba and thon maker goat trio ."
Mo Bamba is really testing the lengths to which KOC will go to defend his pre-draft opinions
Wtf is going on with mo bamba hes only playing 6 minutes a night
Mo Bamba with the cool +18 in 7 minutes... wut?
Guys please don't be too hard on Mo Bamba. It was hard to be the 44th president for 8 years yaknow give him some slack
That song had people thinking Mo Bamba was going to be a superstar
For Knox and Bamba Id say it’s cause the organization they went to just aren’t giving them chances to develop.  Shit I’ll take Mo cause we need a center beside Plumlee
You can’t blame Cliff for everything going on with Mo Bamba. He’s been constantly injured and there have been many things about people questioning his work ethic and his effort but he def needs to play him rn
I didn’t understand the Jerome Robinson pick when it was made and Mo Bamba gotta be on this list
I’ll take him. I’ll even throw Mo bamba in there for you since we clearly don’t want to play him. He’s also backup point guard right now
Magic should give Mo Bamba to the Celtics. Or Vucevic. They could use the size
Mo Bamba has 39% DFG% this season. Clearly the DPOY frontrunner
"we got WCJ &amp; Mo Bamba. Khem was getting minutes regardless, but we can't afford to give him them over our prospects"
Mo Bamba - Sheck Wes
Be good enough to hopefully attract a star free agent.  Or prepare enough assets to trade for the next disgruntled star.  Or draft the next star (doesn't have to be in the lottery).  We could've had Luka if the FO didn't settle on Mo Bamba and instead we tried to actually beat Dallas mediocre offer to the Hawks for the Luka pick.  Being incompetent is only gonna make free agents not want to play their.  Having assets and not using then to get better is also a bad thing.  Like I would love it if we were brave enough to evaluate the next Kawhi scenario and make the appropriate move with the picks we had.  But of course we can't beat out OKC or New Orleans in terms of an offer.
"I was originally hesitant as well when it came the TRB% but I kinda rationalized it in my head by thinking that he was sharing time with guys like Mo Bamba , Vuc and Gordon who got all the rbs and that the system they ran was more focused on Khem boxing out for other's to get the rb.  I honestly don't watch any Orlando basketball so i have no clue how things run on court and was able convince myself that this is a viable scenario. Could be (likely am) 100% wrong though."
"It is so difficult to put on weight at that height. There's a ringer piece on Mo Bamba's pre-draft regime and they discuss his diet in depth. He had a private chef preparing all his meals, he was eating 6,500 calories a day just for maintenance and he was still rail thin. Trying to pack muscle on a frame like that before kids have finished growing is dangerous for their development, your best bet is to hope that as he matures he bulks up more naturally, but he's never going to be Embiid. Maybe Gobert is the best-case scenario phyically?  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/10/17337970/mo-bamba-nba-draft-lottery"
I really do not want to be stuck with Mo Bamba as my back up center.  He was good last night on offensr but his defense is still trash

Damn pelicans need mo Bamba
How could you possibly not have heard “Mo Bamba”?
Mo Bamba
You could throw Mo Bamba in there too.
they're both a tier below mo bamba
"For someone who played 3 competitive games in basically 2 years, I'll take where hes at any day. Lamelo and Edwards are super nice but besides that its not like any other Rookie is killing it right now...Amongst Rookies, Wiseman is 5th in PPG, tied 1st in RPG and tied 1st in BPG all the while ranking 13th in MPG.  I like what hes doing in only 21 MPG. Competes and runs the floor. Hes just gotta get in great shape to be able to react faster to the speed of the game which will happen in the next 1-2 off seasons.   As a Magic fan I saw AG and Bamba shit the bed in the beginning of their career. Thats the #4 and #5 pick. Took AG 4 years and I'm still waiting on Mo and hes in his 3rd year...Wiseman is so far ahead of those guys in terms of overall versatility. He'll be just fine."
Went full Mo Bamba in this one
Why would the child want mo bamba tho
So no one is going to point out that Flo Thamba and Mo Bamba have never been in the same room together?
"mo bamba is old news buddy, we’ve all moved on to flo thamba"
Mo Bamba is the most obvious omission
Mo Bamba can be quite exciting at times but overall he’s extremely frustrating to watch
"Mo Bamba, Nerlens Noel, Myles Turner, etc. The league is, in fact, 90% pretty good 5's."
"Back when Bamba was in 8th grade:  ""Oh, yeah, Mo? What's your Canadian girlfriend's name?""  ""Flo.... Thamba?"""
It sounds like what Mo Bamba would give as a name for his coffee if he was tryna keep it low key and couldn't think of anything better on the fly lol
“I got Flo like Thamba. I want Mo’ like Bamba.”  Someone else finish this bar.
"Child:  Mom I want Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, Mo Bamba, and Jeff Teague.  Mom:  We have at home."
Why does it sound like Baylor's starting lineup is NBA players under disguise.  Flo Thamba is just Mo Bamba in a fake msutache and top hat
"&gt; Mo Bamba  He was the 6th pick not #2, and never meant to be anything besides a defensive rim protector, and he's had injuries, and he's only 22, but besides that yeah. He's been a little disappointing I guess."
It’s just Mo Bamba with a fake mustache
Uhhh Mo Bamba?
"J. Butler, D. Mitchell, Teague, and Mo Bamba  Baylor is stacked. Its not fair."
and Mo Bamba
Flo Thamba vs Mo Bamba who wins
"So we got Jarded Butler and Jimmy Butler, Flo Thamba and Mo Bamba, and Davion Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell.  The simulation getting a bit repetitive and uncreative ngl, what's next ""Bronny James""?"
Are flo thamba and mo bamba related?
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
The Mo Bamba strategy
The disrespect to Isaac Bonga and Mo Bamba.
"Without checking Google, T Ross, Bacon, Okeke, RJ Hampton, Mo Bamba, James Ennis, Birch, Fultz, Issac, Cole Anthony, MCW. That's all I got."
Mo Bamba
Man Toronto fans down bad willing to take a center like Mo Bamba
Mo “Mickey” Bamba had his legacy SAVED by Brandon Clarke sinking this dagger
Mo Bamba just got boxed out by a dude no taller than 5'6
Yeah sure. Just responding to his ignorance. Why is Mo Bamba such an awful defender?
I don't care what anybody says Mo Bamba is the worst player defensively in the league.
stretch 5 Mo Bamba
For someone who fouls a lot Mo Bamba sure is bad at fouling.
"don’t worry nuggets fans, mo bamba will get your guy free throws"
so mo bamba turned into tall steph curry
Mo Bamba FLU GAME!!
"Well, Mo Bamba appears to suck. So."
Can a Magic fan please explain why Mo Bamba doesn't get minutes? Is he just out of shape? Does Clifford hate him?
What does it say about crappy Mo Bamba that he can barely get minutes in a blow out loss with only 8 available players.
"I feel bad for Mo Bamba. He's got facial features that look eerily like my younger brother, who had a bad time in the military, so whenever I see Mo Bamba, I just want to tell him there's a lot of things going well in his life."
Mo bamba doesn't count lol. He isn't a part of a young core if he can't earn minutes on a bad team. He is a bust.
Mo bamba was never really like at all apart of that core besides for maybe a month into his rookie year.   Issac and gordon shouldn't and wouldnt play much at the same time anyway and fultz isnt the best fit anyways next to either one but yea i suppose we never got to see it pan out
&gt;A blows my mind that people are surprised considering Mo Bamba sucks  Do you think it's sheck wes' fault?
A blows my mind that people are surprised considering Mo Bamba sucks and never got minutes at the backup five position anyway.  But yeah they never got minutes and I’m glad because that lineup would suck.  Also AG and Isaac were always staggered with one another outside the first 6 minutes of each half.
"Because I, like many non-Magic fans don't keep up with the Magic. And bruh, please don't act like Mo Bamba consistently being common knowledge amongst most NBA fans"
Unfortunately Mo Bamba sucks too
"I know right! Kevin Knox, Mo Bamba, DiVincenzo, and Grayson Allen. Great stuff. Love where this league is headed."
"I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with Fultz &amp; Anthony too, both are looking pretty promising despite the setbacks they've had. Okeke looks like he could be legit, too. The guys from the Bulls trade should at least be rotation-worthy for now, and Mo Bamba is a basketball player of some sort.  This team is pretty bad right now, but there's a lot to be on the lookout for."
These wins are the difference between Mo Bamba and Luka/Trae/JJJ
"We are actually pretty deep with role players.  That’s not even including MCW and Khem or Isaac and Fultz who are injured.  Just this year if healthy we can start Cole, Gary Harris, James Ennis, Chuma, Wendell and have MCW, RJ Hampton, Ross, Otto, and Khem as our ten man rotation with Mo Bamba Bacon and Chasson as the third stringers.  If Isaac and Fultz were healthy it be even more silly."
Mo Bamba?
His defense is unbelievable.  Maybe I’ve been Stockholm syndromes with Mo Bamba and Vuc for so many years but I forgot what it’s like to have a legit rim protector at the five.  Him and Isaac are gonna be a nightmare.  We might be a top ten defense next year on the strength of those 2 alone.
"I don’t think we suck at tanking.  The other teams playing either suck or aren’t trying hard enough.  I guess we could play Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba (who had a decent game) more, but if you don’t expect guys on our team to try than your gonna be disappointed.  It’s their job to win games and not lose.  You can say Cliff is doing too good of a job coaching but outside of playing Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba more I legit don’t know what else he can do.  He’s literally playing with the hands that he’s dealt with."
"I’m personally skeptical of him because I’ve been personally burned by Mo Bamba with this same type of projection. Lanky dude who racks up blocks in college, it’s easy to project them being great defenders but it’s less easy for them to actually become one in practice. I’m sure he will be able to get blocks in the nba, mo Bamba still has an elite block rate. But that doesn’t necessarily equate to elite rim protection. Hassan whiteside is a good example of that. To be an elite defender you have to be disciplined about going for blocks, strong enough to hold position below the rim, and get boards etc. I think Mobley is way too skinny to even play 5 at all in his early career."
Mo Bamba
"Are you from the area? My north DE HS would play against Westtown twice a year in basketball and damn that team was something else. Watching Reddish and Mo Bamba dunk over my friends was a lot of fun, same with Trevor Cooney and Donte Divencenzo"
im so happy Mo Bamba is getting some Playing time
Mo Bamba shot 2 for 2 from 3 last game. So if he keeps that up then MPJ will have to settle for #2

Mo(st valuable player) Bamba 😤
Friendship with Kyle Anderson ended. Bamba is my new Slo-Mo
"From what I’m seeing clipper fans are giving credit to the magic for the win tonight. It’s the trolls that are saying the clippers are washed just because of this game without any context is what’s getting on their nerves.   Also, Mo Bamba Thats 1 player lol. Off the top of my head I think you guys have Ross fultz isaac MCW and khem on the roster but not sure about injuries"
Okeke and Mo Bamba are the TRUTH  Okeke so smooth with that jumper. Magic future is bright.   Imagine adding Cade Cunningham to this young developing core.
New Lotto odds hopefully goes in our favor but I’m not gonna be mad because like I said if we want to lose all Cliff has to do is play Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba more.  Plus don’t shocked to see T Ross and Birch rested near the end of the season to prevent injury so they can be traded in the off season.
Yeah but he’s the type of coach a young team needs.  Last thing guys need is a losing mentality in their ear.  Plus a win like this breeds confidence for next year.  It’s easy for us to lose games honestly all we have to do is play Dwayne Bacon and Mo Bamba big minutes.  Simple adjustments.  To be fair however Mo was better than Khem this game.
You know until I looked at the box score I had forgot that Mo Bamba was on the Magic. I thought he was going to be a really good stretch 5 before he got drafted
The dude plays every young guy who deserves it.  He only asks that you play defense and don’t be stupid with your shots.  He started Isaac right away.  He gave Chuma minutes right away.  He started Fultz after like 4 games.  You can’t project what he did in Charlotte on to what he does now.  He doesn’t hate young players just young players who suck.  Like Mo Bamba who he still gives minutes to despite not deserving any.
I don't understand what happened with mo bamba
No they have an All NBA talent in Mo Bamba
Wow mo bamba is ass
Dallas was widely rumored to be interested in Mo Bamba so maybe Trae would've been available to us at 6.  But yeah an Orlando Magic pick in the future would've been more enticing than Dallas picks.  Like if we said to ATL pick 6 and a future unprotected pick plus Aaron Gordon or Vuc in exchange for Luka I don't see how Dallas beats that.
"This is the exact same situation that we went through. If you don’t hit the full reset, you end up being the 10th seed and having the 6th pick and getting Mo Bamba rather than a guy like Doncic.   Ben Simmons probably drags a team to enough wins to fall out of the top 3 picks"
"and is on a short list of players with songs named after them, with Mo Bamba"
Lol I remember half our sub pushing for him meanwhile I was hoping we'd get Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba looked good out there
"He's raw as hell. He should eventually be getting minutes, but right now hes not NBA-level. Its like the Mo Bamba case taken to another level."
No because his defense still sucked.  He gets blocks for being long and athletic but Montrez bullies him all night plus his pick and roll d was embarrassing.  He was also 4-9 from the field and bricked some wide open shots.  Bamba was fine but this is as good as you get from Mo.
I’ve had three years of Mo Bamba.  Give me this one thing please.
just as we all predicted it's the Gasol versus Mo Bamba show
"Watching Mo Bamba this game makes me see both the potential he had when they drafted him, and also why he's not good enough to see more minutes."
No. It will be the dynamic duo of Harden and Mo Bamba if that were to happen
Where's Mo Bamba in all this?
WCJ hasn’t practiced or played a game for us yet so too soon to tell but Mo Bamba is really that bad
Bruh they got Mo Bamba &amp; Wendell &amp; you're telling me neither of them are good enough to start on that team?
"wcj hasn’t even played a game or practiced with the team yet, him or mo bamba will probably end up starting soon"
Start Mo Bamba
What happened to mo bamba anyway LOL
"Almost all their decent young players are out with injury.   They won't be ""meh"" next year when they use those draft picks and Isaac, Fultz and Anthony are all back.  However, as currently situated, they are ""meh"" unless you consider Chuma Okeke, Wendell Carter Jr. and Mo Bamba to be exciting. Maybe Chuma is but Wendell and Bamba have largely done nothing in the NBA."
"Let’s take one of the worst centers in the league, Mo Bamba. Mo bamba sucks in the nba against *other* centers  Put an average (below average post defender) 6’3 guard on this guy and he would score every single time. And if gets “doubled by another Curry” it’s not like he needs to panick to make the right play lol"
by the end of the week we are obviously going to be talking about how Mo Bamba is the Embiid stopper
"Mo Bamba, Mo Losses"
Yep they missed out on the opportunity to answer “How’s Mo Bamba playing?” every 3 days due to fans from the song
Did you know the Kings passed on Mo Bamba for Marvin Bagley?
Yeah Mo Bamba is our Kevin Love he will stick it to us.
I think Mo Bamba is more about wingspan than size he's like 7'0 or less no ?
Mo Bamba is another that hasn’t panned out.
"Mo Bamba. He shows flashes of potential, but there are also times where he looks genuinely lost on the court."
"To say talent is as genetic as height... yeah and no. Talent can be inherent, but it's not like there aren't players who were completely average, worked really hard and got very good. To say talent is as genetic as the size you're born into is wack. Sure, there **are** players who are born talented, but there's also the players who are just workhorses who pushed themselves to be incredible. Michael Porter Jr is a great example of the combination.  &gt;and stats this year show he can guard anyone in iso better than **anyone else his size**  Alright, well, again: who's his size? Bol Bol, Tingis Pingis, Ibaka, JaVale, Embiid. I mentioned Boban and Tacko, but they're even **larger**.  It's a no-brainer he's guarding iso better than anyone his size. He's built like a 747 and the best player to be a DPOY candidate (Embiid) has missed too many games to win an end-of-season award. I mean shit, even in wingspan, his only competition is Drummond (by sheer ape indice), Mo Bamba and Whiteside.   I'm not trying to discredit Rudy. I don't know why Jazz fans insist on ""well actually""-ing everything. **I know Rudy Gobert is a highly intelligent and efficient defender.** I'm aware that he does more than camp the paint. I just think that when you shift the competition down to that 6'11 to 6'9 forward size, the players that Bam and Ben (the #2 and #3 in the DPOY race) are outperforming are of much higher quality than the players that Rudy (who is 7'1 with a 7'9 wingspan) are outplaying."
"Probably someone who can shoot really well. Those days were so reliant on paint scoring and paint protectors that adding a guy who could score 3s on high volume at a 40% rate would be the best scorer in the league and open the floor for others. Maybe like Landry Shamet or something  edit: nvm I just realized you said 60s and I don't think the 3 pt line existed then? probably some really long/athletic big man then like Mo Bamba, bonus that you can shoot the jumper a bit. maybe Gorgui Dieng"
"Looool bro hayes has been hurt and since coming back he’s shown incredible court vision and great handle wtf you talking about😂 oooo he got mo Bamba wrong, who cares every draft like 60% bust on anyone’s draft boards"
Lillian Hayes and Mo bamba
"Fultz FMVP, JI DPOY, Chuma MVP, Cole Anthony scoring champ + Mo Bamba with his hoes on the bench."
KOC doesn’t have too many biases (except against Mo Bamba fuck that guy)
"Sure, and Mo Bamba has the potential to be Hakeem"
We really got lucky man.   Imagine what we’d look like with mo bamba and DSJ instead
Exactly and like that video states smaller guys usually work and have to be ridiculously skilled to make it to the NBA compared to someone like Mo bamba
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba is Great at getting blocks and Rebounds but his defense is still not good
in 10 years more people will think about mo bamba the song than mo bamba the player
* Cam Reddish will never be a good NBA player. Those who saw him in college know this. Reddish had a small fragment last season where he wasn't hot-garbage and Hawks fans thought he had turned a corner.  * Anfernee Simmons could carve out a very decent role on a solid team. His 3pt shot % increase may be unsustainable though.  * Mo Bamba needs to switch teams.  * Bol Bol I have absolutely 0 clue what you do with him if you give him big minutes.  Kevin Knox is a garbage NBA player. Wendell Carter I think can still become a good center one day.
Mo Bamba
Yea in fact if anyone was a consensus #1 it was Ayton.   Hell I live in Dallas and a lot of people were pissed we didn’t pick Mo Bamba.   So this Luka was always #1 stuff ain’t it.

"Not an American Sports development but just through watching the NBA I understand this sentiment. You see a lot of players (A là Mo Bamba) spend 1 year in college, declare for the NBA and get exposed for the lack of fundamentals. I remember Charles Barkley that MJ and Bird were so great because their fundamentals were so solid. I think the modern young NBA player is learning how to walk before crawling. Things like the correct pivot foot, how to protect the ball. A lot of the basics are being honed in the pros."
Debatable. I'm putting him around the Mo Bamba and Aron Baynes category
"There are plenty of reasons to be excited about the future of the Orlando Magic. Mo Bamba is NOT one of those reasons. He plays well against bad teams (Detroit, MN) or during garbage time. The majority of his stats against the Celtics came at the end of the game, after it was already a blowout. He's a defensive liability. Rather than rolling to the rim, he pulls out to the 3-pt line. His basketball IQ is probably one of the worst in the league. The sooner the Magic move on from Mo, the better."
Mo Bamba said F*ck Everybody
Mo Bamba had a really bad game though
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba was a bottom performer
"We get a comfortable win, Magic get a loss for the tank. Everyone wins. Except Mo Bamba"
Is MO bamba any good? I completely forgot about him.
any hope of mo bamba being a quality center in the nba got erased watching this
"After watching yesterday, Mo Bamba doesn't strike me as the smartest dude. His stat line looks nice in the end, but it was almost literally his individual fault that the score got to where it did. The Magic started to chip away at the lead, and Tatum wasn't shooting too well, then Mo blocked him on the dunk attempt and started talking shit. Tatum immediately went into T-1000 mode for the next like 5 minutes and absolutely ripped the soul out of the Magic and the score got up to 20+ again, the game was over from that point on."

Mo Bamba taunted him after the block and he scored 11 straight lmaooooooo
"Cole shot 20%, Tacko scored on Bamba, and Mo Wagner was our highest scorer. Literally the only bright side is that we lost."
This how shit Mo Bamba is
Mo Bamba does not know how to play basketball.   Makes that block on Tatum pretty impressive.
Was Mo Bamba as good as the stat sheet indicates he was?
Mo Bamba puts up these stats that look nice but I just watch him and think he’s awful lmao
MO BAMBA
mo bamba tho 😤
Mo bamba 1-7 from 3 and 4-4 everywhere else. Just like you want your center.
We all know Tatum was mad at that nasty block by Mo Bamba and decided to end the game.
Holy shit. Taco makes Mo Bamba look tiny.
"Mo Bamba blocked the shit out of him and he said okay, time for this game to end."
I want to see Mo Bamba come back from summer break with about 80 pounds of new muscle on him. Dude is still so skinny.

"I don’t live in America either, I’m on the other side of the world yet I’ve picked a team. You choosing teams on good “runs” means you’re either a casual or a bandwagon fan.   What savvy moves? They got Allen for nothing and drafted Sexton at 8th, over busts like Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr. They have a great young core of Sexton/Garland/Okoro and Allen. Reaching the heights of another championship that we had with Lebron isn’t a likely possibility, that’s the reality of small market teams. That’s what makes us real fans, we understand this.

I don't understand bringing Mo Bamba in this one. Completely stupid take.
Actually development of players is a severe underrated aspect of drafting. Some players probably could have ended up better or at least solid if they had not been stuck on an awful situation   I don’t think mo bamba is some secret all star or anything but maybe someone could have made him into a solid back up center who blocks shots and can shoot a little
It definitely seems like they drafted Mo Bamba without a developmental plan in mind for him imo.
The Orlando Witness Protection is more fitting then Magic. No one even knows where Mo Bamba is.

Bol Bol or Mo Bamba in a few years maybe
"If player has a talent he will develop everywhere. What players Wolves failed to develop? Wiggins? He was given all the opportunities here, and he is not better in GS now. Culver? He is a bust. Towns ended up being a bad player? I don’t think so. Edwards and McDaniels have shown huge progress this season. Naz Reid is a completely different player after 2 years, and he was undrafted.  Another question - who did Detroit, Magic, Cavs or Rockets really developed over last years? May be Hezonja? Mo Bamba? Aaron Gordon was expected to be a better player, though he is very good. Even Oladipo was not that great there, he became all star in Indiana later. Detroit were consistently selecting mediocre players in lottery - Stanley Johnson, KCP, others. Who they did actually develop so you can say - WOW, this player is really great? Rockets did not have high picks for a while. Cavs got couple in a row and their young players look good, though not good enough (may be yet) to say that the development matters.   You are just biased because Boston really nailed down their top picks with Tatum and Brown as well as their development and roles. However, there is nothing wrong with being drafted by Timberwolves. In addition, our new GM hired a lot of development coaches and all of recent rookies have shown a progress besides Culver."
Didnt Mo Bamba have it?

Mo Bamba is 8 feet tall but wants to play like a 6’2 guard
who let mo bamba take 6 threes
"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."
Terrance Ross and MO Bamba heading your way Pelicans.
I’m still hopeful we will get Mo Bamba and Flo Thamba in the League at the same time.
So Mo Bamba?
"We don’t have any healthy bigs. Ennis and okeke are really our only healthy forwards before signing Dante hall. Even our centers is only Wendell Carter and mo bamba. We just need bodies honestly , very guard heavy"
Mo bamba is so bad
bulls fans made it sound like he was as bad as Mo Bamba lol
"???   2018: 8th pick sexton. 6th pick; mo bamba. 9th pick; kevin knox   2019: 5th pick garland. 6th pick; jarrett culver. 8th pick; jaxson hayes   2020: 5th pick okoro. still early, but opi toppin was picked 8th who we were rumored to take.   like, i know the sentiment was like that before 2016, but we've had shit luck in the last three years and still managed to get quality players that have a floor of being productive starters in playoff teams. still have a lot to learn from Masai/Bobby who manage to strike gold with prospects at the end of the first/second round or undrafted though."
If I cherry pick games pretty much all of the max guys have stretches of 30 ppg. None of them need to cherry-pick to get to 22 a game.  If you look at his averages he’s below pretty much all of them.  MPJ is a 22 year old. He’s 6 months younger than tatum. 6 months ago jayson tatum was putting up 25-10-4  in the playoffs. MPJ is not at that level and will never be.   Mo bamba also hasn’t played minutes. Nobody thinks that he’s still some super high potential prospect. This is because he’s had 3 years of nba training.   Guys who play their “rookie year” as 21 and 22 year olds don’t have the growth curves of guys who start at 19. I don’t understand which part of this is so hard to understand.  He’s a siakam level player on offense without siakam level defense and he’s probably getting paid around a siakam level contract (maybe a bit less).
"After Mo Bamba now Tyler, you better hope no one makes a song named after your draft pick."
"Laughs in Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, MCW, James Ennis, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, Otto Porter JR (I don’t even remember when he got hurt), and pretty much anyone not named Dwayne freaking Bacon.  Dwayne Bacon can survive a nuclear catastrophe unscathed.  That man will not get hurt or sick,  he’s the true iron man of the NBA."
"Which is why it's so dumb to draft a center high unless he's going to really skilled, like Embiid or Ayton or KAT (looking at you, 6th overall Mo Bamba)"
Fine I guess if they like Mo Bamba.
Mo Bamba
Lol wasn't Bagley the 2 pick in that draft?  And Mo Bamba was 6.  Pick position means so much less than results
"First of all, your sentence structure and lack of punctuation is ridiculous.  Second, see Jayson Tatum and Mo Bamba in the NBA. Von Miller and Ryquell Armstead in the NFL. Khamzat Chimaev in MMA. Even a little research will reveal multiple athletes that spoke on how difficult it was for them to recover from COVID. I can personally attest to it too.  No one’s saying they can’t return to full health; we (and they themselves) are saying that it’s difficult."
"Factual I was hopeful for them until Markelle went down and Issac was already down really just destroyed them mentally and caused GM go ape shit There only real good ""developments"" have been making Mo Bamba a positive turning Markelle into SOMETHING and Jo Issac who sadly could not stay healthy to help Orlando.  Unlucky franchise even Detroit has a brighter future with Jerami Grant Magics only hope is a few tank seasons and one wild Cole Anthony who I can already see is turning into a what if story"
Mo bamba actually suprised tf out of me when he started hitting 3s against us.  But Hayes is complete everywhere else though tbf
"Don't be fooled. He's ""shown the ability"" in the same way Mo Bamba can hit a 3 now and then."
Mo Bamba
Mo bamba had serious issues too
"The funniest shit is, Dallas wouldn’t have Trae, they would be building around DSJ and Mo Bamba. Orlando loved Trae and he would have fell to them at 6"
If y’all had the option to have either second half embiid or mo bamba as your franchise player who would you pick?
More like 7 foot mo bamba
1. Jerome Robinson 2. Kevin Knox 3. Mo Bamba
*sigh*  Trae Young Mo Bamba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjGU8F8wsa0
Mo Bamba
they need Mo Bamba
Lol sure you’d rather have Mo Bamba then Marc Gasol
Could be worse.  You could've picked Mo Bamba over SGA and MPJ.
Penny to the Magic confirmed. Bring on Shaq as an assistant to coach up Mo Bamba.
"Of the lottery picks in that draft the only players many people would pick after Bagley are Jerome Robinson, Kevin Knox, and Mo Bamba."
"Outside of Mo Bamba, we’ve drafted really well for our position. The trades are just a separate bad move that were made except Sabonis because it was a draft night trade.  Oladipo was evaluated as the best prospect in a weird draft for us and he will end up being one of the better players from his draft.  Aaron Gordon was a good pick.  Cole Anthony.  Isaac.  All good players we drafted."
Mo Bamba has left the chat...
"No chance, MO BAMBA SON!"
Wanted the Mavs to draft both MPJ and mo bamba
So basically right now he's a more expensive mo bamba?
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba draft stock to the moon
Mo Bamba to the Celtics confirmed?
Up next: Jason Tatums “Curating Playlist” featuring Mo Bamba
I can’t wait for the aliens to rummage the ruins earth to find the one copy of Mo Bamba on vinyl and base their understanding of humans on it.
Mo Sicko Bamba Mode  Timeless classics.
TIL Mo Bamba is an asshole
Mo bamba a bum
Mo Bamba just upset that Sheck Wes is going to end up having a better basketball career than him.
Mo Bamba #5?
Yo I always hear about Mo Bamba but never seen him play. Who is he? Is he any good?
I’m sorry if this is some kind of bait and I’m missing your point and falling for the bait. I don’t keep up much with pop culture  But if you’re being serious... the song’s name is literally “Mo Bamba”... Do you think the rapper coincidentally named it after the collegiate sensation and future NBA player Mo Bamba completely on accident? Iirc the rapper grew up with Bamba in the same NY neighborhood too.
Johnathan Issac is pretty dope.  Michael Carter-Williams looked like he had played basketball before. Mo Bamba is really tall. Markelle Fultz was a #1 pick for some reason.
Hopefully. He does not play inexperienced players as much as they need to play for development if they cannot defend well. Mo Bamba might be released from minutes prison.
To Magic for Wcj/mo Bamba +Gary harris
"Isaac isn’t a center (is KD a center?), Mo Bamba is horrible (needs new scenery IMO) and I’m not banking my future on Wendell. So yeah I like the Mobley pick."
So glad we drafted Mo Bamba over MPJ.
Mo Bamba still has the best rap song of the 2018 draft and that will never change
Oh shit I was on the Mo Bamba train back then too. Glad Travis Shlenk is at the helm and not me lol
"JJJ, Jaxson Hayes, Mo Bamba, Mitch Robinson. Natural talent and athleticism doesn't mean anything if it  a skillset doesn't develop along with it either. Wiseman's biggest problem is he doesn't really contribute anything positively on an NBA court right now aside from his height and length."
mo bamba shot 32% from 3 this year
I wanted us to draft Culver over him. I also wanted Mo Bamba if we couldn't get Luka.   Yes I am a fucking idiot.
There's still people or Markannen island? I'm surprised. Good on you as a long time holder of Mo Bamba stocks.
I thought Mo Bamba and Jaren Jackson Jr would be two of the best defensive players in the League by now.
I thought Mo Bamba was gonna be great 😐
I mean you could make the argument for almost every single all star deserving the MVP but I don’t think Booker deserved it just because of the metrics. He’s got a Mo Bamba and Hassan Whiteside level PER and while I do think you’ve gotta take a stat that has JV ahead of Lebron with a grain of salt that’s pretty damning for who should’ve been in the MVP convo.
mo bamba and tyler herro biggest examples is there anyone else?
Orlando has Mo Bamba.. fuck the need LeBron for?
He doesn’t wanna be the second star next to Mo Bamba
Mo bamba bumps in the Nissan altima tho
Same thing happened to Mo Bamba. 20 years from now kids will have it on their throwback playlists/dances and not have a single clue who he's talking about
brown for Mo Bamba who says no
10 minutes before the 2018 nba draft most Mavs fans had resigned to a. Future of Dennis Smith Jr and Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba also worked out with KG
"Didn't Mo Bamba work out with KG? Andre Drummond too?   I don't get why you would work out with an (former) athletic freak in the offseason to improve your game.  These guys should go work with slow, unathletic bigs that were effective.  Go hang out with Jack Sikma!"
Insane how much mavs prospects changed overnight I remember seeing threads on r/mavericks about how we can build around mo bamba and that we'll be fine and now we are like 100% sure we might get another chip with this kidn
"I remember the Mo Bamba hype fondly, we all thought that was who we were taking. It’s a shame he’s not amounted to anything more than song title yet"
"What a terrifying timeline. When the mavs got shafted with the 5th pick, I was hyping myself up watching Mo Bamba hit 3’s in an empty gym"
Bro it still feels like a fever dream that the Kings passed on him and the Mavs managed to get him. I made my peace with Jaren Jackson or Mo Bamba once the Mavs got the 5th pick in the lottery.
Mo Bamba wants to be a SG soo bad so might as well throw him on that list
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"
Not a sophomore but Mo Bamba started looking goood finally the last few games lmao
"2021 1st rd Bulls pick, Gary Harris, 2023 Chi 1st, 2025 Den 1st, Orlando 2022 1st top 4 protected, Mo Bamba"
"Rap song curse  First Mo Bamba, now him"
Worked wonders for Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba checks in the game.  Close second MCW shoots open jumper.
"Mo Bamba is a superstar thanks to She k Wes  Non-joking though, I agree with this. It’s more about their popularity than actual skill, though you still have to be a top-10 player to be that popular anyways"
**Stares at Mo Bamba**
Mo Bamba
"Wow, only 3 guys between Kevin McHale and Mo Bamba.   Brad Lohaus, Tim Duncan, Jonathon Simmons"
Yes we will send you mo bamba for ball since /u/MGSCG insists
1. Isaac 2. Fultz 3. Chuma  4. RJ Hampton 5. Cole Anthony 6. Wendell Carter Jr. 7. Terrence Ross 8. Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba led Orlando in scoring 4 times?! Did I miss something? Is he good now?  Also Kevin Love is still active and led Cleveland in scoring twice? I coulda sworn he didn't even play this year.

"13/7/2 in 36 minutes s pretty underwhelming for a guy who is more offensively oriented (granted he isn’t horrible at defense or anything, just not great either). He needs to play more to get comfortable in the NBA, but the age is a little concerning. He is two months older than Mo Bamba, who many have as a bust already, and Mo averages 18/13 with three blocks in his per 36 minutes."
Doesn't help when you draft Mo Bamba
"Are you dumb? Mo Bamba managed to hold Embiid to 13, but even then, the Magic are so bad and they can't handle Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and Shake Milton. Hell they even let Mike Scott get 8 pts.  Why would one mediocre player make a huge difference?"
Ik but I was getting told they would win the next two games because the have the embiid stopper in mo bamba
"And just so we have the best arena music we should get John Wall, Tyler Herro, Mo Bamba and Halleluka!"
Mo Bamba for being unguardable and dominant
1. Mo Bamba 2. Hasheem Thabeet 3. Bol Bol 4. Kyle Guy 5. Sean May 6. Rashard Lewis 7. Cody Martin 8. Steve Vasturia 9. Jamal Magloire 10. Jamal Mashburn
"You could pay Terry 25m if LaMelo is the real deal, Miles continues to improve, you get a legitimate starting C, and you have a backup PG that doesn't fuck the offense up.    But yes, the C problem is the massive issue.   Holmes is a good target, but I do think he's going to get a hefty asking price.   I think the most economical, and least sexy, solution is to target Daniel Theis and Gorgui Dieng. You could probably get both of them with our cap space, and I think they'd fit well as they kinda cover eachother's weaknesses. Plus, the money you sorta save can be used elsewhere.   I think that making a competive offer for Marvin Bagley or Mo Bamba is a good route as well, but I wouldn't do it if I had to give up Terry.   If you want to get crazy, throw a fuckton of money at Jarret Allen (definitely not the brightest idea, but I think the payoff would be worth it. But I expect Cleveland to lock that in).   Beyond that though, yea, the C market this year is a bit weak. If anything, I'd say it's worth it to spend the year throwing Carey and Richards into the fire, and wait to make a splash at C in 2022. Or maybe we luck into drafting a reliable C that can share minutes with those 2 to serve our C needs (probably very unlikely)."
Legacy/ranking posts. Nephew tier trade proposals  Giannis for Mo Bamba and picks who sais no?
I agree bro. He is Mo Bamba 2.0
I think Green will be the best player in this draft. I also hope either him or Suggs falls to Toronto. I really think Mobley will just be Mo Bamba.
Mo Bamba gonna be the best player
"Mo Bamba is a pretty good 3pt shooter, like good enough that I'd be annoyed if he passed up an open 3. His defence is terrible right now, but maybe he gets it together this season with a new coach. He has all the tools to be an elite defender, his issues are mostly positioning, strength and BBIQ."
"Giannis built himself from the ground up. He wasn’t like this when he was first drafted and that shows his hard work. People who say he is nothing special are crazy. There are other tall, long and athletic guys like Giannis too yet you don’t see them doing what he does. People are acting like guys like Mo Bamba can replicate what Giannis does easily.   It really doesn’t matter if he can’t do anything else because basketball is a team sport. As far as I know nobody in the NBA is perfect. That’s why they build teams around their superstar’s strengths and weaknesses. If the Bucks can win a chip with their best guy only being able to run and dunk then that speaks to how well put the team is."
"Mo Bamba, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja"
"ill be honest im not sure whether mo bamba is still in the league or not  couldn't tell you who he plays for, if anyone"
It was a joke about how most people are aware of the  song Mo Bamba  before the player Mo Bamba
"No dude, Mo Bamba is a song written by Sheck Wes"
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."
"Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Hamidou Diallo, Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson or Mo Bamba"
Mamba mentality Booker?   More like Mo Bamba mentality
"""How dare you not get in the playoffs with Mo Bamba and Cole Anthony. You're fired!"""
markelle fultz  cole anthony  rj hampton  chuma okeke  jonathan isaac  mo bamba  wendell carter jr  top picks coming  very exciting to me
"They have RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Markelle Fultz, Wendell Carter Jr, Johnathan Isaac, and Mo Bamba which is solid"
Mo Bamba
I didn't think that was funny.  I fully supported Dallas taking Mo Bamba when Luka was on the board.
Mo Bamba
"&gt;in fact he was better than Mobley defensively in college.  Ok, considering you have now said JJJ and Mo Bamba were better than Mobley defensively in college, it's clear you don't actually understand what Mobley's strengths are."
"Mo Bamba was a surefire defensive prospect too, in fact he was better than Mobley defensively in college. There’s no such thing as “surefire.” He has potential and the tools, now we’ll see if he’s able to put it together."
"They just traded their whole roster so this might actually be true. Off the top of my head, TRoss, Mo Bamba, Carter-Williams, Fultz, Otto Porter, and then that bacon guy who I randomly remember lighting us the fuck up. That’s all I got."
Mo Bamba for Luka straight up who says no
"Ya wiseman has shown only flashes, only sometimes, only next to steph curry. There is not a single thing you can count on him to do on a night to night basis.   I put him closer to Mo Bamba than Ayton."
Yeah I see a lot of Mo Bamba in Hayes
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don’t compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to “complete” your rebuild"
Crazy how hyped Mo Bamba was
"I think that’s his biggest problem.   If he had been picked just a few picks lower we wouldn’t be talking about him at all. It kinda sucks that he was picked ahead of a player on the GOAT path   When was the last time anyone heard from Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr., Kevin Knox or Jerome Robinson?"
Mo Bamba...
"I'm leaving the rest of these because we're going in circles and I keep losing what you're trying to argue.  &gt; Based on what? A lot of the players on your current squad were drafted late. Middleton was a second round pick, Donte was pick 17. It’s not crazy to think you could have drafted a rotation player.  And VanVleet was undrafted. Good players late in the rounds exist, yes, but it's a numbers game and hoping that you draft someone like Middleton or Jokic in the 20-30 range isn't a winning strategy for a team that is trying to win. Donte was a fortunate pick (if you redraft 2018, I don't think he reaches 17 - no shade to Kevin Knox, Mo Bamba, Jerome Robinson or Zhaire Smith) and a Bucks pick isn't likely to get as early as 17 for as long as we have Giannis."
"Yeah he was an insanely successful towel boy, what’s your point?   Look we all know there’s no scrubs in the NBA. We also all know what you mean when you say Mo Bamba sucks."
Lol completely useless but also dominated.  Got it.  Mans wants to talk about not watching and then bring up Mo Bamba lmaooooo
Mo Bamba and Mitchell Robinson literally have the exact same play style and role on their team and one has done it exceptionally better since their rookie year and one is struggling for minutes on the magic
1. Ayton  2. Mitchell Robinson  3. JJJ  4. Robert Williams  5. WCJ  6. Mo Bamba  7. Bagley
"The first MB stands for Mo Bamba, not Marvin Bagley"
"Yeah, go get Mo Bamba!!"
"When the Mavs got screwed by luck and ended with the 5th pick, our fanbase was already debating very hard between the likes of Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr. to pair with Dennis Smith Jr.   The future looked bleak and we were prepared for more years of tanking.  Thank you Vlade for making the opportunity for a trade possible. Hands down best GM in Mavs franchise history."
Mo bamba
"Another thing that worries me about Mobley are his extremely high center of gravity (he’ll get smoked by perimeter guys) and, his weight &amp; his thin frame. Mo Bamba, for example, was an even better defender in college - but he’s such a twig that he’s borderline unplayable against NBA centers. Mobley is both shorter and *lighter* than skinny ass Bamba. So I see high bust potential in him"
"Oscar Isaac, Mo Bamba, and Fultz are already projects. It will be funny if Orlando takes in another project. They’ll never finish with all these projects to focus on."
"It wouldve been win win for the mere fact that had the mavs not traded, we'd be stuck with mo bamba and not trae."
Same team that would draft Mo Bamba.
&gt; Not sure why people thought he would be a star.  His bubble run that is all......and mo bamba got a hit song too lol
we got a mo bamba for you
Mo Bamba doesn’t rhyme with that either
Mobley is very very raw. He weighs less than Mo Bamba and we’ve seen how terrible defensively Bamba is against NBA centers (he was better than Mobley in college too). So i feel like he’s not gonna bolster your win% for a while
"a pretty big selection of young guys to develop and try building around, on top of 2 top 10 picks this year along with all their picks + the bulls pick coming up  young players with potential: markelle fultz, jonathan isaac, cole anthony, chuma okeke, rj hampton, wendell carter jr, mo bamba. not a bad start"
Mo Bamba+Sheck Wes combo
"I don’t think Mobley works at the 5 at all unless he gains 30-40 pounds. Dude only weighs 210, less than Mo Bamba, and we’ve seen how Bamba’s weight disadvantages him defensively against NBA centers (Bamba was a better defender in college too)"
Mo bamba was tuff in hs
Did you hear that Mo Bamba commented saying that he was gonna get drug tested for posting this photo and then it turns out he did get drug tested?
Mobley’s gives me Mo Bamba 2.0 vibes with how skinny he is
Mo Bamba and I’m willing to give Frank Ntilikina a shot too
Mo Bamba
Id take a flyer on Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba. I still believe in him
"And I watched tons of Mo Bamba being a Longhorn grad and while he was a tremendous shot blocker and rim protector, he had an awful motor and rarely finished plays on the defensive end like Mobley does."
I watched damn near every USC game. Have you watched him? This guy was the focal point of the offence and posted up 0 points in a game. He ain’t a superstar no damn way. His fuckin brother outplayed him on numerous occasions and Mobley’s got 0 offensive bag to speak of. His defence ain’t even as good as MO BAMBA in college fam. Lmao DPOY potential gimme a break.
"&gt;Mobley was a worse defender in college than Mo Bamba.  This is just not true lol. Mobley showed an ability to defend guys on the perimeter, which is something Bamba could never do. Those two players are nothing alike so I am confused why you are attempting to compare them?"
"Naw. Mobley was a worse defender in college than Mo Bamba. Mobley is also shorter and lighter than Bamba. Look at how Bamba struggles against NBA players, Mobley will go through the same shit"
I thought we were playing the Magic and wondered when Mo Bamba learned to dunk like that.
Then why can’t Javale McGee average 30/13/6?Why can’t zubac be two time mvp and dpoy? Why doesn’t Mo Bamba lead a fast breath as the ball handler? Why can’t DeAndre Jordan have the footwork of Giannis?   There’s lots of “long” guys.. the difference is Giannis is large AND skilled
Is he talking about Mo Bamba
"There’s so much more to Gobert defensively than just length and athleticism. Mo Bamba has almost the exact same measurables but he’s clearly not the same level of player. Being a rim protector requires a very high BBIQ, things like timing, positioning, and communication are vital. Also what makes Gobert so special is the mind games he plays with people. He’s excellent at hiding where his momentum is really going and he’s also great at goading players into taking bad shots. There’s not another player in the league that could pull off what we ask of Rudy defensively- I don’t think most people understand the burden that’s placed on Gobert’s shoulders on that end."
I raise you one Mo Bamba
"Wild to be a perfectly fine #1 with Luca, Trae and Mo Bamba in the draft"
Theyd go for Mo Bamba in a redraft.
Barack Mo Bamba is pretty good
Yes. I remember the draft buzz around 2018. There was the standard luka v Ayton. But also there were random articles about maybe taking Marvin Bagley. After the combine there was even 5 minutes where people started wondering if we should take mo Bamba because of his insane measurables.
Mo Bamba would disagree with you. Dude got a hit song before he was even in the league
Orlando Magic starting lineup:  Cole Anthony -  Gary Harris -  Dwayne Bacon - Moritz Wagner - Mo Bamba   Team Serbia starting lineup:  Stefan Jović - Bogdan Bogdanović - Nemanja Bjelica - Nikola Jokić - Boban Marjanović  Why exactly do people think Orlando could beat Serbia?
"Bro if fucking Mo Bamba made it he'd be mad and questioning it and probably blame it on the song because he doesn't deserve it either.  &gt; Yeah, he's mad because a white dude made it  Tell me you're racist without actually telling me you're racist  &gt; He's either supremely ignorant  How is it ignorant to think Kevin Fucking Love of all people in 2021 shouldn't be in the Olympic team? Why is the only player that shouldn't be on the team also white? My guy you're doing the classic ""pointing out potential racism is actually racist"""
You’ve never truly been high until you’ve been high on mo bamba
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
I’m still pretty high on Mo Bamba becoming a star
Might catch some flack for this but I would’ve even preferred Mo Bamba over him during that draft. I was never a fan of Bagley after his college year.
It’s crazy to think the only player in the top 10 of 2018 so far that looks like a certified bust is Kevin Knox at 9. That draft class was loaded with talent.  Mo Bamba is still on the fence for me and KOC
"SGA is likely a future All-Star.  Same with Colin Sexton.  JJJ could be one if the Grizz are winning games, as well.  Too bad Mo Bamba can't figure out his shit as he could actually be pretty good.  If these guys did figure out their shit, you could have it where there's 8 All-Stars in Trae, Luka, Ayton, SGA, Sexton, JJJ, MPJ, with someone like Mo Bamba/Bridges/Trent Jr./Bagley taking that 8th spot."
"Honestly I think they’d both be good fits if they swapped places again. They have a lot of similarities in their games.   The Mavs won the trade though, because without the trade the Hawks would have Luka and the Mavs would have picked Wendell Carter jr. or Mo Bamba"
We were actually going for mo bamba
Mo Bamba in center position
Mo bamba got hoes
**Deandre Ayton** is a **Young Star**  **Marvin Bagley** is **Salvageable** (lol)  **Luka Doncic** is an **All-Time Great**  **Jaren Jackson Jr** is a **Future Star**  **Trae Young** is a **Playoff Stud**  mo bamba  **Wendell Carter** is **So Talented**
man wtf happened to mo bamba
"here's one description of Mo bamba for fun  &gt;Bamba is truly an elite physical talent with a wingspan and standing reach that don’t come along often … He figures to be a capable rebounder and rim protector at the NBA level from day one. This alone gives him one of the highest floors in this draft, with an extremely high ceiling as well … His defensive potential paired with growth as a player, added girth, and experience could render him one of the best defensive bigs in the game for years to come … The fact he has a nice looking jumper and is already starting to get good results from the free throw line and in game situations at such a young age can make him an asset in terms of spacing as well … If he’s able to piece together all the areas of his offensive game, he actually has the potential to be a legit offensive NBA player while still being a defense first guy"
"We will give you #5, Markelle fultz and mo Bamba. That’s 3! Top 6 picks for just 1 top 1 pick. Pretty generous honestly"
"If you didn’t want us to get this far, you shouldn’t have given French Mo Bamba 35% of the cap"
Just ask Mo Bamba
"But Mo Bamba is a stupid example because wasn't anyone building their franchise around him. We're talking about players that are superstars and single handedly transform a teams fortunes. Funny how you've completely ignored my Doncic example. The whole fucking conversation is me saying, yes I would rather take the chance that he busts because that chance is small, than settle on a player that's just ""good enough"" because he has potential to be much greater. Sorry, you're not changing my mind. If anything Philly fans should agree with me. Think about how ridiculous this is. According to your logic, Sixers would have been dumb to draft Embiid if they could have traded him for Blake Griffin instead. After all, he was coming off a season in which he was 3rd in MVP voting. See how stupid that is? After all, Embiid could have been a bust and Griffin was an injury prone yet established great player."
"And you had the nerve to jab at my supposed lack of intelligence. Look at this cold ass take. What a ridiculous statement to make. Yeah right bro, I sure remember talk about Mo Bamba being a franchise guy to build around. FOH clown. Does this logic apply no matter how much a player has broken down? Cunningham could also be the next Grant Hill. Should we just sign up Grant Hill instead being that we already know he reaches his ceiling?"
"Nope. The lottery and the NBA for that matter is a lot like life.  It’s not fair.   When we start creating rules to allow for equal outcome rather than equal opportunity, we are opening up a can of worms that we wouldn’t be able to come back from.   You want to complain about the system? How about complain about the front offices of the Kings and Magic that can’t build a winning team after many years of top 10 picks.   It’s not the Cavs/Raptors fault that the Kings drafted Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson with top 10 picks in the recent years.  It’s also not their fault that the Magic selected Mo Bamba, Mario Hezonja and a bunch of good but not great players for them like Jonathon Issac, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo all in the top 10."
"In my unbiased opinion, I think Detroit should look at prospects Jonathan Kuminga and Franz Wagner to put in that roster, along with someone like mo bamba, instead of Cade Cunningham"
This seems like the most Orlando pick ever.  Mo Bamba 2.0
"We have had a bad FO historically speaking I'm not going to argue that and the case is yet to be made on Hammond/Weltman but we have also been genuinely unlucky in a lot of regards, Mo Bamba and Mario Hezonja are the only straight up misses I'm willing to admit draft wise, we have been plagued with some of the worst injury luck in the entire league and as mentioned we have had one draft since the Dwight trade that we actually moved up."
Someone like him who has whiffed hard hundreds of times really shouldn't say stuff like this lol. I remember the dude basically being ready to retire if mo bamba didnt pan out
"First round draft picks are like cars, they lose a ton of value once you drive them off the lot. Looking back at 2018...the 6, 16, and 18th picks would have gotten you Mo Bamba, Zhaire Smith and Lonnie Walker so the likeliest scenario is that they end up with some rotational players in a few years."
Mo Bamba
"Bagley's health has been really concerning, but I'd share the ""bust"" title with him and Mo Bamba."
I am dying on the Mo Bamba hill. I just want the magic to full send it with him and Isaac in the front court
Mo Bamba szn

"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"Ish Smith, Jimmer Fredette, Lance Stephenson, Mo Bamba, Aron Baynes.  The perfect storm of Lance going off for 25 in a half, Jimmer making every open 3 and having a somewhat favorable matchup on defense, Baynes and Bamba catching every lob and getting every put back and Ish getting you 12-16 could beat a team that overlooks them but should lose every other game they're in by quite a margin.  Bench could feature: IT, Brandon Jennings, Andre Drummond, Jeremy Lamb, Bismack Biyombo."
Mo bamba would like to chime in on that
"No, not really.    By pick #6 the draft is becoming a lot more of a crapshoot.  Just at #6 the last few years - Okongwu (too early, but not the greatest start), Culver, Mo Bamba, Jonathan Isaac (good player but injury train wreck thus far), Buddy Hield, Willy Cauley Stein.  Like - that isn't exactly a shining crop of players at #6 last few years.  Even if you go back a few more years it's hit or (more) miss - Smart, Noel, Lillard, Veseley, Udoh, Johnny Flynn.  Long story short - I don't think anyone is even eligible for ""biggest busts in modern NBA history"" if they weren't a Top 3 pick."
And Mo Bamba and Myles Turner. Texas is a big man factory
"He was #50 in his class and was playing behind first round picks pretty much every year.  Texas has mismanaged a lot of their program, but their development of bigs is not where they struggle.   Past 5 years:  Kai Jones #51 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 19th pick  Jericho Sims #50 prospect in class -&gt; 2nd round, 58th pick  Jaxson Hayes -&gt; #102 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 8th pick  Mo Bamba -&gt; #3 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 6th pick  Jarrett Allen -&gt; #17 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 22nd pick  Myles Turner -&gt; #6 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 11th pick"
Mo Bamba!  Love his potential.
Mo Bamba. I haven't seen any reason to believe this but I'm trying to speak it into existence. Dude's a 2k God.
I am still a Mo Bamba and Bagley believer. They just need another team
Mo Bamba
"No he’s gonna lead the magic to the championship in 2024 with a core of him, Isaac, mo bamba and an auto generated guy named Anthony Taylor!"
"Bol Bol, Mo Bamba. I think they could both break out if they would get actual minutes somewhere. Their current teams (DEN/ORL) aren't playing them at all.   Luka Garza could join the conversation of guys like Draymond, Manu, and Jokic in terms of most successful 2nd round pick, IMO. He can score like very few others I've seen and if his defense can become even just a slight negative instead of just a black hole, that's better."
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba will finally get a proper opportunity with Vuc gone.
"I think worst case scenario is that he joins Mo Bamba in the ranks of, “The song named after me is more famous than my career”"
He definitely had NBA hype before the song was popular. I first heard the song in January 2018 before it was big and I still had heard of Mo Bamba the player before that
Mo Bamba
We’re careening towards a Siakam-Barnes/Mo Bamba-Jonathan Isaac tag team match aren’t we
Well sometimes you draft on potential and it end up with Mo Bamba
"You guys have a really fun team, will be one of my other teams I follow closely this season! Will the depth chart look like this?  Fultz, Suggs, Ross, Okeke, WCJ  Anthony, Hampton, MCW, Franz Wagner, Bamba   Harris, Mo Wagner, RoLo"
"Has to be a 3 team trade to get Simmons to Orlando, Dame to Philly and Portland Get MO Bamba and 1st from phi plus a pick swap"
Magic fans dumb af right now  This ain’t like drafting Mo Bamba
if the kings didn't fuck up and draft Bagley Mavs were gonna get Bamba iirc. Imagine their team now with fucking Mo Bamba. Literal worst team
"Dame for Jonathan Isaacs and Mo Bamba, who says no?"
"Sadly Gordon just wasn't a fit for us. I mean, it didn't help that we had different coaches that tried to play em above his role. But yes, the AG/JI duo was awesome. I am glad he's found his fit with the Nuggets.  i always wish Mo Bamba turned out well too to see a potential defensive trio with those three. Im still holding onto hope for him that he at the very least becomes a serviceable starting big man.  Also, looking forward to your guys squad this coming season! Was already on your guys bandwagon once Vooch got traded to yall lol"
"It's not just Hayes, he is way too high on too many guys who bust, he loved Frank Ntilikina and Mo Bamba too. It's a bad track record. Tjarks to me has consistently been better.   I also listened to his free agency podcast and he said that he liked the DeRozan, Jarrett Allen, and fucking Zack Collins contracts. I don't think I can disagree more with someone's view of what were good contracts in this off-season.   His analysis is just not that in depth. It's simplistic and lacks nuance. He repeats the same advice for literally every guard star in the NBA, in that he always says the next step for Dame, Harden, Trae, LaVine, Booker, and Beal is to play off the ball and cut like Steph Curry, neglecting the fact that Dame and Harden are too old to change their games like that and that NBA superstars love having the ball in their hands, not running around off the ball hoping to get the ball back from an inferior teammate. You're not going to turn Dame into an off the ball player at this stage in his career, it's just not going to happen. (How's he going to do that on the Blazers anyway?)"
Everyone is either a superstar or potential superstar and then when someone sucks they act shocked that by 25 they are still riding the bench not getting minutes.  I've been really good at calling busts before they've been drafted since Mo Bamba because every bust has the same red flags.  Not saying I want Wagner to be a bust but when you have dudes who only look good because their lack of athleticism isn't exposed because of college competition then you know I'm not going to be stunned when the higher level exposes that.
Dude I hope for the best but I will never be the type of fan who blindly expects dudes with obvious red flags to be anything.  I've been scarred by Mo Bamba and Hezonja.  Two dudes with obvious red flags that I blindly ignored for their first year expecting it to get better.
how much championships do you guys have? i swear one of the latest guys you drafted turned out shit in mo bamba lmao.
Mo Bamba isn't good
"Sims was better last year for Texas than Hayes or Mo Bamba were, in terms of actual contributions to a winning college team. But he’s older and has a lower ceiling."
Not MO BAMBA lmao
Damn I forgot about Mo Bamba
"Orlando already had three young centers on the roster in Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba and Moe Wagner, so what was the point in using the MLE on Robin Lopez as well?"
It's been hit or miss recently.  Jarrett Allen and Mo Bamba
"In 2024 we'll have choices like Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, Kai Jones (just drafted), Myles Turner, etc.  sorry i think you might be able to find my bias lmao"
"&gt;So 20 year old healthy mo bamba probably has some other long haul symptoms that aren't covid related. He's healthy and probably didn't have bad covid, but had something else entirely even though he's healthy and young. Got it. Makes total sense. Florida strikes again.   That's not my statement, but good strawman.  COVID ""long haul"" issues are relatively new recognition of issues that persist with viral infections. Similar to myocarditis already being prevalent in viral infections but receiving more coverage over time. You're still talking one major athlete having some long haul issues, which can range from miniscule to severe, over thousands.  &gt;Where again did you mention 20 year Olds. And how does that relate to jeremy lin?  So we're going to ignore KAT as the example lmao?  Lin is 32, he is, still, in one of the lowest tiers for concern. The individuals that are of actually concern for the OP statement is coaches and referees who are 50+ year old men."
"So 20 year old healthy mo bamba probably has some other long haul symptoms that aren't covid related.

Neither is jlin. What.    Edit: mo Bamba was 22 when he got covid. Still got a case of long covid.
"You know it’s the Magic. They got all those benches beat.  Cole Anthony/MCW, Suggs/RJ Hampton, T Ross/Bacon, Franz &amp; Mo Wagner and Mo Bamba/Robin Lopez  Assuming returning starters are healthy and starters are Fultz, Gary Harris, Chuma, Isaac and Wendell Carter."
Shh.  They don't know.  Mo Bamba sucks on ball and in the post.  His best asset is weakside help shot blocking.

Shh.  They don't know.  Mo Bamba sucks on ball and in the post.  His best asset is weakside help shot blocking.
"Is Mo Bamba the new Thomas Robinson, where every team thinks they can spin gold from straw?"
Mo Bamba is only good in 2k
"I think something people overlook is you can try TOO hard on defence and can hurt as much as poor effort. A lot of defence is about discipline - you look at a guy like KAT, and often his problem is he jumps too often or he overzealously commits. It's not that he's not putting as much effort as he can, he's just not using it at the right times, and in the right situations.  You look at Mo Bamba, who has the longest wingspan in the league, reasonably good feet, and is pretty athletic. Nonetheless he's a bad defender because he's always out of position, and is often overeager and fouls (then gets discouraged and the opposite problem of not enough effort happens)."
"Mo Bamba is definitely in a sink or swim situation. He *needs* to show improvement and that he belongs. First healthy off-season, no Vuc, open path to minutes and will battle for the starting spot. His rookie contract elapses at the end of the year, and if he disappoints again we will let him walk or trade him at the deadline. I believe in Mo though, he will turn heads this season.  Wendell Carter Jr is in a similar situation, but less precarious. He's shown enough in the short stretch post deadline that I think he is a solid NBA player with a lot of untapped upside. He struggled in Chicago but I think a lot of it was mental, and it was night and day coming to Orlando with a chip on his shoulder."
Its definitely Mo Bamba
feels like mo bamba
Im verypne hyping up the wagner bros. What about the mo bros? Bamba and wagner?
"Carter, Bamba, Robin Lopez, and now Mo Wagner lol"
"Mavs fans are getting a heavy dose of this as well with all the new fans for Luka.  Shit, just a few years ago we thought Dennis Smith Jr. was going to lead us to the promise land if we got lucky and ended up with Mo Bamba.  But yet they bitch about not being able to land all the good deal ring chasers like the Lakers - GTFO...."
When evaluating players it's not ridiculous to do it based on who is ahead of them in the rotation.  It's natural to want the players in the best position to succeed so that the team can get better.  I don't Mo Bamba playing point guard because he needs minutes or Suggs playing Center because we have a lot of guards who need reps.  That's bad development.
"I highly doubt it, Robbins in his athletic piece said that RoLo was signed so “Mo Bamba had someone to go up against in practice everyday.” Then Wagner shouldn’t be given any big role except filling out the roster. I don’t believe they’re giving up on Bamba at all."
"They’re not going to value Mo Wagner over Bamba, he’s going to be nice depth just in case any of the bigs get injured. He’s versatile enough to play both PF &amp; C."
"You must be new to draft season, you can find videos of Ben Simmons and Dwight Howard knocking down open 3s. Mo Bamba supposedly was knocking down 3s with a new shot effortlessly in open gyms"
Mavs because without the trade we end up drafting Mo Bamba or Wendell Carter jr.
yeah he was in Toronto last year  what about TRoss + Mo Bamba
How is the Mo Bamba projections going? Did vooch leaving do him any favours?
I predict he plays over Mo Bamba after the first month once Mo makes a bunch of defensive mistakes
Orlando magic have injury prone isaac/fultz and one covid~recovering mo bamba...otto left cant forget gary harris
I’m not an Orlando fan btw. I’m rocking this flair cause Mo Bamba is from where I’m from. If I could just have a Mo flair I would. your bitch ass typed all that bullshit for nothing.  Stupid ass bitch. You know what I said is true so you have to attack a flair 😂
"Delon Wright, Kelly O and Mo Bamba in fantasy at the end of last year was like the Heatles lol"
It's Mo Bamba
They ducked sup on developing Mo Bamba for us. It we will let that one slide
Mo Bamba!... still sucks.
"Can we name a few? Not challenging you or saying you’re wrong, but not many really come to mind for me for picks that high.  On the other hand you’ve got people like Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Harry Giles, WCS, Mo Bamba, Cody Zeller, etc, all off the top of my head who never really panned out. Feel like there’s tons in the opposite direction."
I want Mo Bamba to be good so I can hear that song in all the clips when he sinks a game winner.
Mo bamba if/when he grts consistent mins
No I hear you- in the same way who do you think the Warriors could fetch for Steph? Someone like Luka or maybe Mo Bamba? I sound completely reasonable right now btw
Mo bamba
"AD plays PF and C, mostly PF.   But also is it really accurate to say hes a one man team defense when the magic had so many athletic perimeter defenders? I was watching Lebron vs Isaac highlights to see how well he defended bron, bron was able to beat Isaac off the dribble a few times but the magics had a guys like Arron Gordon and Mo Bamba collapse the defense and block his shots"
How's that working out for Mo Bamba?
Mo Bamba?
"Oh touche, I thought RHJ went way higher than that...still I could find other examples too if you wanted. Jonathan Issac, Frank Ntilikina, Mo Bamba and Deandre Hunter are a couple other ones..Hunter looks to be working out though."
It appeared great but let's wait and se how it turns out. I thought Mo Bamba was going to be elite too and that didnt turn out well lol.
Mo Bamba was supposed to be the next great long boi.
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."
"We will give you Mo Bamba, and all the money generated by the song Mo Bamba for Ben Simmons"
Mo bamba time 😎
Imagine taking Mo Bamba over Trae Young in hindsight lol  Dallas did a full 180 on their draft
"My Team: Orlando Magic   Best Offer: Disney World Tickets, the return of MCW, and Mo Bamba (the song not the player)  Philly Sends: Ben Simmons   Cap Situations: Idk lol   Pitch the trade: you’ll have more fun at Disney world than you will watching Simmons play"
orlando gonna regret it if they dont take Corey to pair with mo bamba 😤
"I didn't say ""you people"", I said ""people"".  ""Covid cult of science""? Yikes. Science is a cult now? I guess that means you're someone who survives without technology, even though you're commenting on reddit?  &gt;has it done any of those things to athletes, the subject of the conversation? not playing what abouts with you  Literally yes.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/3/3/22292213/athletes-covid-recovery-stories-jayson-tatum-mo-bamba-asia-durr  Tatum actually needed an inhaler for a while *after* recovering from Covid. So yeah, it affects the healthiest of us.   https://www.sbnation.com/2021/4/14/22383455/jayson-tatum-covid-celtics-inhaler  These also aren't ""what abouts"". The virus has serious impacts on people even if you're young and healthy. Like I said, dying isn't the only outcome to care about.   ""Covid does nothing to healthy people"" is objectively untrue."
"Mo is averaging 3.2 block per 36 **for his NBA career** on only 4.6 fouls per 36.  There are only 4 players averaging 3+ blocks per 36 this year: Noel, Gobert, Timelord, and Daniel Gafford on 14 minutes a game.    There are only 11 other players who averaged even 2 blocks a game with qualifying games played.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_minute.html  Bamba is getting the blocks.  The difference is he didn’t swallow people on defense the way Mobley did.  No one was calling Mo a generational defensive talent, the comparison is not apt IMHO."
That's not what I'm saying though. OP said all of the things that were said about Mo Bamba pre- draft defensive wise and I just mentioned it doesn't always translate. Never compared them as a prospect.
Mo Bamba was the third big off the board in 2018.  They're not even close to comparable prospects.
Mo Bamba
"And I’m clearly an amateur scout here giving my opinion, take it for what it’s worth ;)  But he swallows guys defensively in college and has 2.9 blocks per game with only 1.8 fouls.  He’s an outlier IMHO.    That said, I have not really watched enough Mo Bamba to have a worthwhile opinion.  High blocks per minute from him."
Not saying he'll be the same but the same things were being said about Mo Bamba.
Not saying he'll be the same but the same things were being said about Mo Bamba. Defensively obviously.
Not saying he'll be the same but the same things were being said about Mo Bamba.
Not saying he'll be the same but the same things were being said about Mo Bamba.
"We all knew when we drafted him he is a project. Could be Giannis, could be Mo Bamba. He's still 19, so still developing, and we saw a huge change for him between the start of the season and the end."
"LMA was forced retired after a good career. KD, PJ, the Kardashian and Augustin (if he accepts the ring) are champions. JA and Turner are starting caliber centers in this league. And at least Mo Bamba has hoes."
"A lot of dudes who are 6'10""+ will say they're 7' but true 7 footers (without shoes) are rare.  Like KD has admitted he'll call himself 7 feet sometimes but he's only 7 feet in basketball shoes. Even Mo Bamba isn't 7 feet in socks. There was a time when Hibbert was the only true American 7 footer in the NBA."
They say Mo Bamba is still bulking up till this day.
Not that he would be an all-star but I think Mo Bamba would be a much-improved player if he was drafted by a team with actual minutes available at center.
PG: Malcom Brogdon (4)  SG: Luka Doncic (1)  SF: Saddiq Bey (3)  PF: Robert Covington (5)  C: Anthony Davis (2)  6: Gary Trent Jr. (6)  7: Mo Bamba (7)
"Pg: Joker  SG: embiid  SF: Nurkic  PF: Bam  C: Porzingis  Bench: Capela, Jarret Allen, Mo bamba, Plumlee, Jaxson Hayes"
"MCW is not the backup SF, he's like the 15th man. He probably doesn't play outside of garbage time.  It'll be probably be:   * Cole Anthony  * RJ Hampton  * Terrence Ross  * Franz Wagner  * Mo Bamba  Most of these bench units are missing key guys, possibly because you used ESPN. [This is a much more accurate source (although not perfect)](https://www.nbcsportsedge.com/basketball/nba/depth-charts).  In no order: Boston, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Washington probably are the top 5."
One of the few young teams I'm keeping an eye on this season. I really wanna see what happens with their PG development and how Mo Bamba and Issac perform this season.
"Neil deGrasse Tyson of Harvard/NASA talks Mo Bamba song, Tips on how to dunk, Defensive rotations, Disneyworld, and How to score 50+ in an NBA game"

"if u had to make a starting 5 of nba players with songs named after them specifically, what could u have  i have:  pg: tyler herro by jack harlow  sg: KOBE by Lil Uzi  sf:   pf:   center: mo bamba by sheck wes   can’t think of any for forwards"
We have Mo Bamba.  If they are interested.  I'll take Bruce Brown. Don't need Kyrie.
"""We elect to make Mo Bamba eligible for the draft again and then re-draft him"""
"Our FO has been remarkably competent outside of one major mistake.  The same people trashing us will say crap like Ibaka for Oladipo and that's how I know they not only don't know what they are talking about but are likely just casual fans of basketball in general.  Outside of drafting Mo Bamba, every move WeltHam has made can be classified as largely positive."
Would Mo Bamba be a crazy pick for MIP?
"NBL is pretty good. They win vs division 1 teams when some high majors travel overseas to play them and the top teams barely lose to NBA teams. I remember Melbourne United won vs Texas which featured Mo Bamba and Matt Coleman and in that same year lost to OKC by 1 with OKC big 3(PG, Westbrook and Melo) playing the majority of the game.   I think they neck and neck with G-league and a tier below Liga ACB."
"I think Shawn Kemp deserves to be in the conversation for top 5-ish too, he was just such a insane athlete for his size. I feel like Mutumbo should be up there a little bit for the era he played in. 7'2"" and probably a massive wingspan but also very strong. Rodman was also pretty insane, like 6'7"" with a 7'7"" wingspan.   There also needs to be like a separate category for guys that really never put it together. Like where does  Mo Bamba fall in? Genetically gifted but hasn't really put it together."
No one knows or cares about mo Bamba lol
"Probably Mo Bamba. I saw his floor as a Capela-type starting center, and his ceiling at AD level franchise-changing big man. Didn't work out obviously."
"That's great in theory, except that Dallas won't have cap space either. The article makes the point that it doesn't look like anybody really will:  &gt; On Aug. 15, HoopsHype's [Yossi Gozlan](https://twitter.com/YossiGozlan/status/1426990210735173637?s=19) projected that seven teams would have cap space next offseason. Since then, four of those teams have cut into that space significantly. Boston extended several players, Charlotte extended Terry Rozier and signed Kelly Oubre, New Orleans re-signed Josh Hart and Detroit acquired and waived DeAndre Jordan. The remaining three all have meaningful players whose possible extensions could and likely will cut into their space as well: Memphis has Jaren Jackson, San Antonio has Lonnie Walker and Orlando has Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter.   Now it's always possible some teams could shuffle things around to try to open up space for Beal or LaVine, but until that happens it's not much of a bluff on their part to say ""trade me or I'll walk."""
Bro why would I hate on white guys LOL. Im more than happy with how attractive I am LOL. And no I didn’t ignore them but you’re ignoring my points. Im sure TikTok has all to do with it and not how generally attractive Tyler is to a a basic chick and yes being white makes you more attractive. mo bamba who also had a very popular song about him was not pulling like Tyler is LOL.
Ya black NBA players get no clout fr fr. Mo Bamba could never.
That’s not at all what happened. Someone asked Mo Bamba got a song? And OP responded with their fun fact.   It’s like if your mom was asking you what kind of fish do you want to order for dinner and you respond with ‘I like turtles’.
"Yeah but the overall discussion was about why Herro's popular.   Someone said it was because he was white, and another person countered that it was because he has a popular song about him.  They replied that he only had a popular song about him because he was white, and the counter to that was Mo Bamba had a popular song about him despite not being white.   But Bamba had a popular song about him because he was childhood friends with the rapper. No such connection exists between Harlow and Herro."
Well I said something about the genesis of the song so someone did...it was me.  I agree Mo Bamba does have a song. It was made by a guy who was his friend before either of them were famous. It's pretty different than how Tyler Herro got his song.
That's a little different... Mo Bamba and Sheck Wes were childhood friends.
"Its called mo bamba, it was a banger."
Sheck Wes - Mo Bamba
"He got the frame before the song, the song didn't even go crazy like Mo Bamba.  it would be foolish to say him being white has nothing to do with the fame."
Lmao. Do you think mo bamba got a song named after him cause he’s black?
Mo Bamba got song ?
Mo Bamba is white?
It's the Mo Bamba effect. Any player with a song instantly gets a +10 stat bump
tbf Trae packed Mo Bamba I understand why Ben didn’t wanna get put on Trae’s DPOY reel
"Forgive me if I'm just wrong here, but was Mo Bamba ever actually good in the league? I thought he was pretty much just hype from his measurables."
"Fultz, Suggs, Ross, Isaac, WCJ  Anthony, Hampton, Wagner, Okeke, Bamba  MCW, Harris, Brazdeikis, Mo Wagner, RoLo"
"The team with 3 Hall of Famers on it.  Markelle Fultz, Mo Bamba and Jalen Suggs."
Mo Bamba still there?
Instead of getting Mo Bamba we get less
Instead of getting Mo Bamba we get less
I’ll say it:   Mo Bamba by Sheck Wes? Not a banger
Mo Bamba?
"In their defense, nobody knew how good Mo Bamba would end up being."
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
"As a Magic fan, I knew in my soul that this would be a clip of Tacko making Mo Bamba look like someone's grandpa in a pickup game."
Mo Bamba
"throwing lobs to Mo *""Two Years Away From Being Two Years Away""* Bamba 😤😤😤😤😤"
Mo Bamba in Orlando lol
Have you seen how much muscle Mo Bamba has put on this off-season?
Anthony Edwards for Mo Bamba straight up fuckin do it pussy
Mo Bamba
Source say Mo Bamba has put on another 20 pounds for the 3rd off season in a row
He blocked Mo Bamba
Never forget he blocked Mo Bamba Trae is a runner up dpoy
&gt;need  They just need more... mo... Bamba!
How many fucking times am I going to have admit Mo Bamba
“Why would the Warriors give up Steph for Mo Bamba?”
Fultz  Lauri  Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba
"He could pull a Jermaine O'neal. Jermaine didn't click until he left Portland, so who knows for Mo Bamba"
Woah chillll. Good song but not as big of a banger as Mo Bamba. Mo was playing everywhere.
"The point is that Jonathan Isaac is in fact not a center lol, he just can play as one better than Mo Bamba"
Tyler Herro wasn't as big of a song as MO Bamba. Even my British football( soccer) coach was bumping to thst shit.
Robin Lopez about to share his comic book collection with Mo Bamba and that absolutely rules.
"I believe he'll be starting by the ASG this year, if not sooner. New coach, fresh off-season, and he's working on the very things people have been slamming him for, his endurance and energy on the court.  The thing lacking from Mo's game the most oddly enough is a post game. He was asked to do some pretty weird things early on in his career, like working on his 3 more than his post moves (likely because we had Vuc). The hope is that Robin can challenge him heavily in practice and teach him some good post moves (like the hook shot, it should be unstoppable in the hands of Mo).  I'm on the Bamba Boat. I believe in the guy."
"Ayton was also featured for the Suns due to being the first pick whereas mo was playing backup five behind all star vuc with jerian grant as his point guard.  Anyway I’m not arguing Bamba over ayton as a prospect. I just use him as an example of the developmental curve of young bigs. Ayton was a much better prospect in much better scenario for him to succeed, with much more invested into him by the franchise. His body was more nba ready and it still took him all that time for people to consider him a positive.   I disagree Bamba hasn’t shown anything offensively. This season he got up to 18 per 36 and has good shooting potential. He’s also just a very good rebounder who will feast on the offensive boards as his body continues to develop. He’s also a good lob threat but the magic have never had a playmaker to run him in pnr with."
Honestly didn’t realize Mo Bamba was a person
"KOC the last man on the Mo Bamba boat, holding out hope"
LOL it's a slang term for cocaine in Italian. So Mo Bamba = mo coke
Does Mo Bamba have the highest Quality of Song to Quality of Player ratio ever?
Mo Bamba and Evan Mobley have similar builds. Scary.
"translation: please someone trade us anything at all for mo bamba  for the record, i like him and still think he could be a great player, but it aint happening in orlando. they should have traded him to NY for noel or something when they had the chance."
Mo Bamba Mo Problems
This FO is afraid to admit they made a mistake with drafting Mo Bamba.  He's a bum.  They would rather trade away Vuc and release Khem Birch than get rid of Mo Bamba.  Bamba is so bad that WCJ immediately started over than him.  Just give up on the guy already.
"So, the Magic signed Robin Lopez to make Mo Bamba as good as Robin Lopez."
"Bamba has low key potential that people don’t realize. His main problem so far has been lack of strength and conditioning. He’s had an incredibly tough hand dealt to him in every respect his first 3 years. Stress fracture in leg, having to put on a ton of weight, long covid, etc. never had a healthy offseason in the league until this summer.  The main reason for optimism with him is that his biggest issue is what his main strength was supposed to be, defense. He’s been slow mentally and physically on defense to this point. A lot of it is related to the conditioning problems mentioned, and a lot more has to do with lack of experience to get used to the nba game. I point to ayton as an example of how much this matters cause he just figured it all out defensively and he and mo were the same class. However Mo has as many minutes in his career that ayton played in his rookie season. The guy has just never had time to play games, makes mistakes, and improve. He still has freakish physical gifts that should definitely allow him to be at least an average drop coverage defender with a ceiling much higher than that.  He’s shown the ability to put up big pts/reb/blk numbers so if he get his defense together he will be a good player. Last season after all star break he was putting up 10/7 in 20 minutes. If he can get his conditioning and defense together enough to stay on the court his production can be very good."
"Jonathan Isaac is a better 5 than Mo Bamba right now, if I’m being completely honest.    So yeah definitely empty stats. Mostly from that game vs Detroit where they made the dude look like Shaq with a jumper"
Jonathan Isaac  Mo Bamba Wendell Carter Jr Markelle Fultz  Cole Anthony  RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke
"Jaylen Brown as a prospect was covered heavily.  He took a different route academically and knew he would spend very little time at Berkley compared to the average student, so he designed much of his own curriculum and made arrangements with professors to get the most out of his time.  Most kids don't do that.  Rarely even the bright kids, especially in state schools.  There are a few players that the press just loves to laud their perceptiveness and worldliness, especially given their young age.  It's an awesome talking point, Mo Bamba had some favorable coverage where the press talked up his smarts, Malcolm Brogdan had a masters degree by the time he was drafted, etc etc.  Academic excellence can generate click throughs just as well as academic scandal.  In the end, much of draft coverage aims only to be amusing and have the audience come away feeling informed."
They might try and Mo Bamba Monkey and ease him in unless he's a stud.
MVP: Joel Embiid.  All NBA: Curry - Doncic - Durant - Antetokounmpo - Embiid.  MIP: Mo Bamba.
"Bamba Mo. 5 is the title, actually"
Wendell is a lot closer to Mo Bamba and Bagley than to Luka and Trae.
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba # 5?
Ok but have you guys seen the videos of Mo Bamba working out this summer? Him and Ben Simmons have been working on their jumpers.
"To be fair. Mo Bamba is very tall, and very athletic. He still has the potential to be a very good rim runner/shot blocker, but everyone says he just doesn't put in the work to grow into that potential. There's been so many guys as athletic as Kobe in the NBA, but very few have the work ethic and mindset to do what he did."
Mo. Bamba. But honestly who didn’t see that coming?
"Dallas was never going to draft Mo Bamba, it was Wendell Carter"
Mo Bamba had GOAT potential before he was jinxed by that song. I will never forgive Sheck Wes for that.
Evan Turner Michael Beasley  MO bamba off the top of my head
"Isaac, Suggs, Fultz, Cole and then it's a toss up between Wendell, Mo Bamba and RJ Hampton but I'd keep Wendell Carter."
Mo Bamba with that Harvard background
Vuc saw Mo Bamba get drafted and decided to fuck all the Magic plans by becoming a downright good player.
I think they’d rather stick it out for 5 years and make Siakam or FVV money after utilizing our development staff then be Mo Bamba my dude.
"Except that’s not the case.  Most players were bad or did nothing before Orlando.  Tobias Harris before he got here wasn’t much.  Vuc became an All Star in Orlando.  Fournier became a starter.  AG became a great defensive player.  Markelle Fultz became an actual player.  Cole Anthony has I,proved in year 2.  Mo Bamba finally has developed this year.  Wendell Carter has been way better in Orlando than he ever was in Chicago.  Going further back than that.  Hedo Turkoglu in Orlando finally broke out. T-Mac became a superstar.  Really only Oladipo and Elfrid Payton are the only players I can think who didn’t work out in Orlando and in Oladipo’s case he was traded too early.  So you’re kinda speaking out your ass here."
"Cam Reddish, Saddiq Bey. Jordan Poole I'm not that sold yet, hope it was not just preseason fluke. Desmond Bane. Jordan Nwora. Mo Bamba. Tyrese Maxey. Keldon Johnson."
Mo Bamba finally getting hoes
Well so far Ayton hasn’t came back like he has unfinished biz and a chip on his shoulder. Mo Bamba is avg more pts in fantasy LOL
TIL Mo Bamba is more than a hiphop song
Mo Bamba
"Yeah I was looking for this one. With how he struggled at the end of his college season I was so sure he was gonna be a massive bust. I also thought Mo Bamba was going to be a great player but let's give him some more time. In my defense, I did flip my shit everytime someone said Luka wasn't worthy of the first pick, it was obvious he was the best player, so that redeems those other takes a bit"
"Rudy Gobert   Dame  KAT  And I've always been a believer in Mo Bamba, still think the guy can make a splash in the league."
I'm ready for the Mo/Banchero/Bamba/WCJ/Lopez lineup. Jon Teske sixth man  but for real why so many damn centers
Mo Bamba. Last season was 8/5.8/0.8 and 1.3 blocks. This season 14.3/9/2.3 and 2 blocks. Shooting has gone from 47/32/68 to 54/43/58.   Needs to work on those free throws a bit.
Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba finally got them hoes now???
MO BAMBA &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LITCHELL LOBINSON
I don’t know how but somehow WCJ and Mo Bamba work together
Mo Bamba will kill us inside
"Nah not hating lol. It's just that anthony edwards is now 6'6, and one of the most athletic players in the league who is buckets. He's going to need the ball in his hand more.   Might cash in with dlo and get a 3 off ball decent defensive capable player like Harrison Barnes,   the hawks having alot of forwards,   Orlando having Cole Anthony, and mo bamba. (Kat not good paint defender)   Feel like the pelicans would be the type to trade ingram for dLo if the Timberwolves put a pic in there.   cam Johnson on the suns since cp3 is not getting any younger and dLo and Booker are BFF."
"Gonna look like a genius when both get traded to Orlando for Gary Harris, Markelle Fultz, Mo Bamba and a pair of Disney season passes."
Mo Bamba is a small forward
Mo Bamba All-star
Mo Bamba?
Mo Bamba is our center  WCJ is the 4
Trade LeBron and AD for Mo Bamba
"Feels like 40 games of Isaac, as long as he's still a plus defensive player (top 25 even, not his pre-injury top 10) would be enough for them to get above 15 and closer to 20.   The guards will mostly be horrid, but Bamba/Carter-Isaac-Franz Wagner is a structurally coherent enough frontcourt (okay defenders, nobody with horrible complimentary skills) that if one of Anthony or Suggs are good every 2-3 games, they can win some of those.   You have to be really bad to win 15. Right now, by WS/48, 4 of the 6 worst players in the league playing rotation minutes (over 15) are Magic guys (Anthony, Brazdeikis, Suggs, Mo Wagner) and that seems unlikely to last. If Suggs and Anthony can be terrible instead of dead last among starting guards as the year goes on they'll win some games.   I did seriously think about the under of 22, but I don't hate  the frontcourt enough to have them at 15, even if Anthony is going to heroically try to get them Jalen Hardy or Banchero to be their #1 scorer next year."
Mo Bamba and Miles Bridges top 2 MVP candidates 2022
A 6 foot PG with Mo Bamba arms and Chris Paul physique.
"Mo Bamba might lead the league in blocks this yr, Jonathan Isaac is a DPOY player when healthy, WCJ is a really good defender, Franz Wagner at 6'10 and Chuma Okeke at 6'8 are long and tall wing defenders. Jalen Suggs is also a really good defender Magic have all the makings of being an elite defensive team."
Mo Bamba would drop 40 on us easy.
"Mo Bamba, maybe?"
I am liking the mo bamba trebuchet threes
Mo Bamba is a legitimately good 3 point shooter
i knew mo bamba would finally drop shaq-like performances and make the song relevant again
"I've read ahead in the manga.  Without wishing to spoil, nobody saw what happens to Mo Bamba in the playoffs."
"Wait a sec, MO BAMBA led the team in assists?"
Mo Bamba
Lol he got all those assist because of Karl Malone is does not take a genius to figure that out lol. Let’s see how many assist would he have if Karl Malone was replaced with Mo Bamba. Lol
For Wendell carter and mo bamba?

KOC’s entire reputation now riding on a 50 pt Mo Bamba game tonight
When did Mo Bamba get so good?
Mo Bamba is amazing
Mo Bamba is the oldest player in our starting lineup tonight
The piano version of Mo Bamba does not work at all
"Glad to see we both got the same  2. / 3. / 4.     1. Could be Melo, who will for sure improve his numbers this year (he will be a star for sure but last season he only averaged 16, so he will for sure improve a lot)    For 5. Maybe Wendell Carter or Mo Bamba? JJJ is a good pick too"
"Nah, i think hes just honest  This the same dude who said “Hell No” when asked on insta live if Mo Bamba is better than him. He’s more than willing to be honest"
Me either! I had already accepted we were drafting Mo Bamba.
"Tyrese Maxey, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Darius Garland, Rui Hachimura and screw it, ALL of Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba (BUY MAGIC STOCK!)"
Mo Bamba. Proved he can put up counting stats last season. Now had his first healthy offseason of his career and is in the best shape of his career
"Just a little context: I would be very curious to see the amount of games Bamba has actually started, and within that sample size the ones that did not occur in his rookie season.   The truth is he was very much in Coach Cliff’s doghouse and got limited opportunities whenever he was not injured. That stat of games played is pretty misleading to the amount of quality minutes he has gotten to play.  On top of that, he just looked like he didn’t give a damn about playing for Coach Cliff. Not gonna make any judgements on his character from that because sometimes when you feel like someone has it out for you that can affect a lot of things in your life. He seems to be enjoying play basketball again under Coach Mo.  Having watched Bamba his whole career these past 4 games have been BY FAR the most engaged he has ever looked in an NBA jersey. He is everywhere on defense, making the right help rotations. Getting back in transition and running the floor etc., time will tell if he can keep it up for the whole season but he certainly looks like a different player."
"Oof. Siakam is an institution in TOR. You can't get rid of DeRozan and less than 5 years after get rid of Siakam. That'd be a disaster.  Honestly, the only play here is a Magic max offer. We'd humbly offer Mo Bamba in return. It's a tough call but we're prepared to make that sacrifice to help both Sarver and Ayton.   It's the only play."

"Out of Trae's 3 options, I believe that is the one he is most likely to win. That block he had on Mo Bamba shows flashes that he is an elite rim protector. Capela might need to be the back up center."
"A healthy MPJ probably goes 2 to the Kings and 1 and 3 basically play out the same way.   You'd probably flip Bagley for either JJJ or Mo Bamba. Not sure which team would have taken him, but Bagley absolutely goes no lower than 6 IMO."
"No Mo Bamba, KOC is IRATE right now"
"I hope we extend mo Bamba on the cheap, but I bet he’s wanting to bet on himself after seeing what wcj got. He’s looking primed for a breakout year if we could lock him up for 10-12 million that would be awesome. Having those two locked up for 25-30m total would be ideal. That wcj deal was a steal."
"Suggs ROY, Mo Bamba MIP, Fultz MVP, Issac DPOY (blocking shots on and off the court), Jamahl Mosley COY, Cole Anthony 6moy, Magic go undefeated in the playoffs and beat the Warriors in 4 games."

Mo Bamba Mo Losses
All we need now is for Mo Bamba and Cole Anthony to turn into the new Shaq and Penny
"What's worse is they are hyping up Mo Bamba, but admit he's not as good WCJ. That's not good then?   As a wolves fan, I wish I had their enthusiasm."
Mo Bamba in shambles
Tell me you’ve never watched Mo Bamba without telling me you’ve never watched Mo Bamba
The one reason they *might* be able to work together is that Mo Bamba can shoot. The real test would be on defense imo.
not all of them are hits but there are tons of songs named after players. mo bamba is by far the biggest tho.
Lil Wayne's Kobe might be the closest. Not as big as Mo Bamba though. The Tyler Herro one could be near third
Mo Bamba on course to be the worst player with a hit song
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Mo Bamba had a great preseason
I want Isaac Bonga or Mo Bamba damnit!
i'll be happy if this is the year mo bamba is good
The disrespect to Mo Bamba
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
"Crazy to think that four years ago the Mavs were probably thinking of building a core around DSJ, Harrison Barnes and Mo Bamba.   I couldn’t be more grateful for the team we have now despite its flaws"
"Mo Bamba: ""It doesn't."""
"With Mo Bamba rumored to be on the trade block, it would be interesting to see them pick him and and run the most dominant defensive lineup in the league.   My true hope is that Bamba goes to Dallas and plays along side Luka. I think he can become a Deandre Jordan type center, but with a jumper. He just needs a playmaking smart PG like CP3 was for Jordan. If this happens you will see Bamba become more relaxed and play more to his strengths. I think FVV can do this for him as well."
"Right: Luka, Trae, MPJ, Zach Lavine  Wrong: Lonzo, Dennis Smith Jr, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Culver"

"I think the magic. I understand teams that may struggle in the Midwest or smaller markets, but your in FLORIDA.   You got high pics and did nothing with them. You chose to pick up Markell fultz as if he can shoot after his accident. You've drafted the same position for 2 straight years. Cole Anthony rj Hampton Jalen Suggs.   I don't see any player that says wow for merchandise. It's just sad. You got all the theme parks, clubs, weather, diversity that would attract any player but can't get any notable names or look to even try to.   You have the most athletic big man with the longest wing span in nba history train that dude into a faster Rudy gobert in mo bamba. Then u got Johnathan Isaac who ppl say have the potential to be the best all-round defender. But nothing..."
"This is how bad he was last game. From 2:31 up to 0:47 of the 4th quarter, while the Spurs and Magic were neck and neck:  1. That steal and breakaway dunk by Anthony where Luka just gives up on the play halfway down the court. 2. Magic run a P&amp;R leading to a wide-open Carter dunk where Luka was supposed to rotate but completely missed it. 3-point play. 3. Magic run another P&amp;R where Luka sags but fails to account for Mo Bamba as the roll man leading to a alley-oop dunk.  His fuckups on the defensive end allowed Orlando to score 7 points in a game the Spurs won by 1. If that's not cut-worthy, I don't know what is."
1. Edwards - finished the 2nd half of last season strong and has a coach that can utilise him properly  2. Tyler Herro - he had a down year last year after all the bubble hype and will have a bounce back year playing with his new teammate Kyle Lowry  3. SGA - has the green light on a poor Thunder roster   4. Mo Bamba - has showed a lot of promise in the preseason so far   5. Miles Bridges - will take another step and get great looks playing with Lamelo  6. Michael Porter Jr - he showed what he can do after Murray went down and he became the second option behind Jokic
"1.) Anthony Edwards - better team around him, all the tools, better coach  2.) Darius Garland - super slept on and Miami may have a better record but another year of Garland developing and he’s gonna put his name out there   3.) this is tough because I don’t see OKC doing much this season and would tank towards the end, I’m leaning Ingram because of the expected improvements   4.) Mo bamba just cause   5.) Mikal we’ve seen what he can do and I’m expecting improvements from him   6.) MPJ, he’s going to thrive as the second option without Murray there I hope JJJ has a great season and I was originally really high on him but idk anymore"
"Wendell and bamba were picked like one after the other, but I’ve heard people being high on mo this pre season at least."
"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/3/3/22292213/athletes-covid-recovery-stories-jayson-tatum-mo-bamba-asia-durr  You can also literally see players struggling after getting Covid, even if they're cleared to play."
I got suspicious when Mo Bamba claimed to have gained thirty pounds of muscle in one off season. That’s humanly impossible.

"This thread is about Mo Bamba, I talk about Mo Bamba, and you INSIST on talking about Myles. You sure you're okay?"
If Kevin Knox doesnt step up hes out the league for sure. Also Mo Bamba
People have loved shitting on Mo but love sucking off Myles Turner on Twitter.  Bamba has been just as good as Myles Turner PER wise. He always has been by the advanced metrics. Hopefully this is the year where people finally see it with their own eyes.

Mo Bamba might actually be more relevant than Sheck Wes next year
"Mo Bamba, deadeye shooter. Gotta say, I did not see that coming."
Mo Bamba breakout szn
He is still a puppy. Go ahead and hit save on this one ladies - Mo Bamba will be an all star one day.
Mo Bamba has looked pretty dominant.
"I've been pleasantly surprised - he's much better than advertised by Bulls fans.  Obviously not the same caliber player as Vooch, but after almost ten years of a slow post up big, it's nice to have a more dynamic guy in there.  Don't know what the plan is moving forward, but in pre season he's played some minutes at the 4 alongside Rolo.  If and when we get Isaac back, WCJ lack of size at centre shouldn't be as much of an issue.  Also, he's better than Mo Bamba."
"Fultz, Suggs, Okeke, Jonathan Isaac, Mo Bamba"
"Wingspan to height ratio is known as an Ape Index and the largest in the NBA is Bruno Caboclo at +11.0 (+11 = 11 more inches of wingspan than height), followed by Mo Bamba and Bismack Biyombo at +10.0, and THT and Reggie Jackson round out the top 5 at +9.0"
Id agree but have you seen Mo Bamba on the court? Dude looks like all arms.
"Dejounte Murray, Tyler hero , Harrison Barnes, Og, DeAndre ayton.   Bench. Jonas, Mikal bridges, lonzo, MO bamba, Cole Anthony."
"Willie Cauley Stein became our starting center... He was cut by the 20 win Warriors. Our center rotation is legitmately one of the worst I have ever seen.   Houston and Orlando can barely win games but they still have Wendell Carter, Mo Bamba or Christian Wood, Sengun, and Daniel Theis, all who are infinitely infinitely better than Powell, WCS, and Moses Brown. Boban is effective in very specific situations that come about like once every 10 games.   That being said, I think Dorian Finney-Smith definitely gets minutes off the bench for the Suns and Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup point guards in the league. Issue is Brunson is straight up our number 3 option and third best player and Finney Smith is our main perimeter and wing defender, and honestly one our more important shooters with how bad Hardaway/Bullock have been.   Hardaway and Bullock need to get it going so our shooting can at least start to cover deficiencies some games. I think both are capable of being very solid players as we saw from both of them last season."

"Gary Harris/Terrence Ross toss up right now lol.  Mo Bamba at 3rd   Solely based on on-the-court performance really, and TRoss has been playing better (by this years standards). Gary has looked awful in every game except for 1 fourth quarter"
Wait i thought mo bamba was having a decent year?
He's a pretty bad defensive player in terms of awareness and positioning.  He gets bullied by bigger players.  And he is a good shot blocker but bad rim protector if that makes sense.  Basically he challenges every shot by going for the block but if you pump fake you can probably get him up in the air and then make a shot over him.  It's one game but Thad Young murdered this dude with constant hook shots.  That being said Mo Bamba has improved on offense a lot.  He has finally started shooting hook shots and his face up game is legit.  He also plays tougher on offense than defense which is weird.  He's athletic getting to the rim and dunking it.  Needs to work on his hands because the dude turns his head away way too much on pick and rolls.  Also still the worst player in the league on delivering hand offs.
Mo Bamba actually is better than u think. One of the best shotblockers and this season he starting to hit a solid amount of 3s. Not too bad for a guy who never really got NBA minutes
"Year when Orlando drafted Bamba there was so many silly talks about how Mo is gonna seriously eat into Vuc's playing time and that Magic now gonna trade him, I drafted him in like 50 ish spot to pair with Jokic and Nikola's duo was blasting other teams away(also want to mention Nikola Mirotic, who was terrific that season but I couldn't get him nor on draft day or through trade)."
"Mo Bamba and ""Someone on the Kings"" aren't in contention at all lol.  Killian Hayes looks awful. My vote is Killian Hayes."

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Orlando has had breakout seasons from Cole Anthony and Mo Bamba, and are still short key rotation players, including Isaac. They are gonna be a late season nightmare for some teams who don't realize how rock solid they are. Nobody elite, but if Suggs starts coming around late season, with Anthony, Isaac, Bamba, Carter, Wagner, and Hampton could really be a ""late season hot team that people look at next year like they could be a player"" situation."
Everyone here still feel the same about Mo Bamba?  This was quite the thrashing before the season begun.  Let's hear it!
Yeah we were calling Mo Bamba a bust till this year. He's turned his game around. I think a lot of it is having a coach that believes in them. Going to the right situation is a important for young guy. Especially in the more slow developing positions like point guard and center.
"Players basketball reference lists as centers who take more than that per game: 17 (KAT, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Horford, Jokic, Bamba, Olynyk, Vucevic, Wendell Carter, Jr., Muscala, Sabonis, Theis, Mo Wagner, Bjelica, Jeff Green, Anthony Davis, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl)  And that's just on a per-game basis - if we did per 36 I'm sure that number would be significantly higher.  I'm not trying to disrespect Valanciunas - he's a good player - it just never made sense that people were claiming that he's a floor-spacing 5"
Bagley and Mo Bamba are going to be better than Luka.  or   its a joke.    we'll find out in a couple years.  And no I'm not Vlade Divac.
Put some respect. No Beal and it wasn’t close for the vast majority of the game.   So glad to see Mo Bamba breaking out too.
Mo Bamba and his hoes rise up
Mo Bamba is surprisingly good this year though so don’t lump him in with Bagley 😭
Damn the future mvps Bagley and Mobamba (the well known evil twin of Mo Bamba) didn’t win roy? Worthless award.
AD for Mo Bamba
OP SAID DEANDRE JORDAN FOR MO BAMBA LOL
"for the amount of assets you probably need for mo bamba, you could probably find a better difference maker that fits the lakers timeline and for probably less"
Cole Anthony &amp; Mo Bamba borderline all-stars right now (Probably a stretch)
"Oh, I must’ve gotten him confused with someone else. I thought I remembered the Magic declining some option. Sorry about that.   I still feel like Wendell Carter Jr and Mo Bamba don’t fit great together, especially once Johnathan Isaac returns. The Hornets would obviously have to offer enough for the Magic to feel a trade was worthwhile though."
"If you don’t think Cole Anthony having a break out season, mo bamba finally looking good, and Franz looking like an amazing rookie idk what to say. Along with that we are missing 2 starters."
"According to 538, Mo Bamba has a D Raptor score of +0.4 and Plumlee has a score of -1.7, so he should be at least a little better defensively, right? It’s real hard to be worse than Plumlee on defense right now."
Mo Bamba / Cole Anthony
"I’m hoping we trade for Mo Bamba. I find it hard to believe the Magic see him as a part of their future, since they declined his 5th year and extended Wendell Cater Jr."

I completely forgot Mo Bamba was in the league
To be fair Mo Bamba is so bad on defense half the time it's like he isn't even there. I've never seen someone with that height and wingspan get owned so much.  He never gets his hands up unless he's going for the blocked shot.
Mo Bamba might as well not be there anyways with that much space between them.
he shot over mo bamba like he wasn't even there lol
"check the posts from today. i've made highlights for mo bamba, harden, kd, LMA, and 2 from the bucks game. thats hardly a lot  these are the only ones you remember. doesnt mean they're the only ones that exist"
"i don't?  check the posts from today. i've made highlights for mo bamba, harden, kd, LMA, and 2 from the bucks game  &amp;#x200B;  problem is y'all are so used to only a few players getting lowlights that people are only used to being able to shit on them, so these ones stand out lol"
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
"Mo Bamba, Wagner and Cole Anthony…"
Package him with someone else to get Mo Bamba
I was completely wrong. I thought he'd be more like Mo Bamba (who actually had a pretty exceptional freshman year at Texas). But Mobley is absolutely more versatile on both ends.
You're just talking about Mo Bamba
Current: Mo Bamba  Former: Aaron Gordon
"not that far back, more like 2/3 years  ago when they had Vucevic/Mo Bamba/Jonathan Isaac/Aaron Gordon all playing significant minutes"
"Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr are shooting 39.5% from 3 on decent volume, jussayin"
"💯 i barely knew about this kid then as a 6’3’’ guard saw him absolutely shit on the knicks and grab like 15 boards, he is awesome and his teammate Mo Bamba has been a pleasant surprise as well"
"Indiana has to be the least covered team in the league by a HUGE margin. Even with A player like Sabonis I don’t hear a single thing about them ever. Like, even the magic get some coverage for Mo Bamba and now Cole Anthony."
"Thanks, Mo Bamba"
"He's talking about Mo Wagner in this video, not Mo Bamba.  This was when Wagner had only been on the team for like a week."
"i'm confused about the Mo Bamba line, was he not on the team before Cole?"
"Mo Bamba 2.0 for the Magic. Cole Anthony is just playing too good right now, just like how Vuc became an all-star caliber player right after drafting Bamba."
SHOUT OUT MO **BAMBA**
Have been watching a lot of Magic games this season - Mo Bamba is looking real nice and so does Franz Wagner. It will be only a matter of time before Jalen Suggs gets it together and the Magic will look really dangerous. I admire Mosley prioritizing letting the young players have as much playing time as possible over the vets.
"This dude took a major jump   Man what??  He used to be so inefficient  Magic still have Suggs, Wagner, Isaac, Fultz, Hampton, Mo Bamba and Carter Jr  That is nuts"
Also shoutout to Wendell Carter.  He's such a stud.  He plays excellent defense and now that he has the 3 ball down he's a legit stretch 2 way  big.   He's everything Magic fans think Mo Bamba is and this was actually a good Mo Bamba game.  Also this was by far Suggs worst game.  Even on defense he looked lost chasing Utahs shooters.
Nah I’ve given up on Mo Bamba years ago
Mo Bamba
He does have a song named after him so he’s either going to be Mo Bamba or Lebron James
If it were that simple Mo Bamba would be DPOY lol
He's done more in the NBA than Mo Bamba at least
Don't think Mo Bamba is that good bruh
what happened to Mo Bamba?
"Other than Terrence Ross &amp; Mo Bamba, other fanbases probably know MORE about our current team than our own fans do"
"Damn, Mo Bamba is the second coming of Hasheem Thabeet so far."
Technically that song was made about college basketball player Mo Bamba
Hey man. Mo Bamba would like a word
"Lmao Mo Bamba will be the third string center on whatever team he's on. Traded away Vuc, bought out Birch, and he still can't earn minutes. He's literally the third most tenured player on the team behind Ross and Isaac, and he's non-existent."
"Donta Hall is my new best friend.  Mo Bamba go to the airport we got our 23 year old cheaper Khem Birch.  I miss you Vuc, but not your defense."
Donta Hall btw everybody.  Mo Bamba bout to lose his backup spot to a g league journeyman because at least Donta can play defense and hustle.  Friendship ended with errbody Donta Hall my new homie.
"I know. Mo Bamba, I get. But Mo Bamba has also constantly been injured since his rookie season and has been playing behind an all star center. And we were still trying to win."
"I mean not quite, we gotta see how Isaac and Fultz return from their injuries. Cole Anthony and RJ Hampton look promising. Can’t say much about Mo Bamba."
I thought Mo Bamba would be legit. I saw his practice videos moving like Embiid and I wanted the Mavs to draft him so he could be the next Dirk. Good thing im no GM
Lakers NEED Mo Bamba
"a random trade i thought of was  Magic get: Hassan Whiteside, F Robert Woodard (salary, 40th pick in 2020), 2021 Lakers 2nd  Kings get: Mo Bamba  Kings do a 2 for 1 player deal while also taking a flyer on RFA Bamba. Maybe Kings would value this for a different move vs a 2nd for Whiteside.  Magic at least get something for Bamba, maybe can flip Whiteside to a contender.   My imaginary contender flip would be to the Celtics where the Magic get back another mid/late 2021 Celtics 2nd for Whiteside."
Yeah they were working out the summer after Tatum’s rookie year together with Mo Bamba. I remember Joel boomed it on Mo and said “Welcome to the fucking league!” Lmao. It must’ve scared the shit outta Mo Bamba because he does not get talked about
Could be worse.  You could have Mo Bamba.
"And no Bamba is a faster sprinter than John wall. https://www.stack.com/a/gigantic-nba-prospect-mo-bamba-can-sprint-faster-than-russell-westbrook-and-john-wall  I can’t understand you thinking combine stats are going to win you this argument. People have seen klay play at his athletic peak, and to call him unathletic at that time is absurd. He’s not elite by nba standards but he is good laterally. It would be impossible for him to guard the elite guards 30+ mins a night if he were the level of athlete you’re trying to portray him as. Fact is he took the toughest backcourt matchup every night in a stacked west for years on teams that were great defensively. He’s not an elite shutdown guy but he is good because of his combo of length, lateral agility, and feel."
We have Mo Bamba.  He's big.
"&gt; is it worth it to run it back with this same team and essentially top out as like a 5-6 seed   No reason that 5-6 is our ceiling to be honest. We have 4 real vets on our roster. Vuc, Fournier, Ross, Gordon. One of gordon and Fournier will be moved for luxury tax reasons. That means next year our 9 man rotation will have 6 players 24 and under.  Fultz, Cole Anthony, chuma okeke, Jonathan Isaac, mo Bamba, and our pick this season. We will likely get another young player in a trade involving gordon or Fournier.   The reason to sell vucevic for picks and young players would be is if we were in need of those things, and we aren’t. If we trade vucevic essentially our entire team will be young players and we resign ourselves to multiple years of being terrible. Magic fans and ownership would much rather we be competitive with room for growth than engaging another hard reset. The minute we trade Vuc we will go looking for a stretch 5 to open the lane for our young guys because Bamba isn’t ready to start. Seems kind of ridiculous to do so when we have an elite on already on the roster.  &gt; Vuc when is value is sky high and getting back potentially some nice draft picks and young talent.  The other part is that his value isn’t going to radically change in the next year. If we’re underperforming next season we can move him at the deadline, he will still have 1.5 years left on his deal at that point."
Add in the fact they will probably still be a bottom 3 team with him. I was just looking at it from the standpoint what are they going to do with Mo Bamba
“Are you better than Mo bamba?”  “Who the hell is Mo!?”
"Hey Riley, Isaac Bonga, Mo Bamba, and Jahlil Okafor are a on the block. Make the calls."
Trade that bum KD for Isaac Bonga or Mo Bamba.
"If we're competing, I'd want one of Richaun Holmes, Marvin Bagley, Khem Birch or Mo Bamba. All those guys should be within our price range (Raptors can't really match salaries for Drummond).  But if we're trading Kyle Lowry, then I'd want at least a prospect, 1FRP and expiring salary. Ideally, I'd wanna get an additional pick or some decent role players with the returning salary."
"Yesterday's power forwards are today's centers basically.    Someone like Vucevic  would've been exclusively a power forward for their lack of rim protection before ~2010. They haven't been wiped out, just moved up to center. In the past, you would've had Vuc sharing the floor with another big dude like Khem Birch or Mo Bamba. The same kinda thing goes for the PF position too though, most of today's PFs would've been SFs in most other eras.   We've gone from PG / wing / wing or forward / forward or big / big   to PG / wing / wing / wing or forward / forward or big"
the way people on the sub talk about wiseman you would think he’s worse than mo bamba.... Pain
"He averaged 20ppg shooting 40% from three during his last year in college as a shooting guard. It wasn't a terrible selection especially considering MPJ and DiVincenzo were the only notable players taken after.  It just obviously hasn't worked out for him at the pro level like a lot of late lottery selections. Even Kevin Knox looked pretty abysmal his first couple seasons, and he was taken higher. Mo Bamba too."
"Tanking isn't a guarantee of turning the franchise around, the Magic know that from drafting Mario Hezonja 5th overall and Mo Bamba 6th overall. As a fan I'm content being mediocre then overpaying for a star FA when the team's cap and FA opportunity line up (like Charlotte did with Hayward).  Ask Sacramento (just for example) if it's a good idea for a small market to completely depend on the draft. For every top 10 pick that turns into De'Aaron Fox there's many more who turn into Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Caulie-Stein, etc."
Mo bamba cannot play the game of basketball
"Facts man. If the Mavs take Mo Bamba like they obviously should have, they'd be a dynasty right now. It's a shame that Donnie Nelson still has a job."
"AG and Mo Bamba for Aldridge and picks. I dunno how many picks, 2 frp?    Maybe this trade doesn't work but its about all I could come up with."
"I think they should trade him so they should secure a top 3 pick as well as be able to evaluate Mo Bamba. Vuc value is as high as its gonna be. They need to sell Gordon, Fournier, and Vuc. Land a top 3 pick and see who they draft, Fultz, Issac, and Bamba look like next year."
"Mo Bamba will dominate the league and put Embiid in his place, haven't you heard?"
Mo Bamba
Abdel Nader &amp; Mo Bamba
They 100% should.....They are going nowhere.....Fultz and Isaac could potentially never be the same after tearing their ACL's.....Aaron Gordon is never going to take it to the next level.....Mo bamba hasnt improved at all....might as well get all you can for Vuc and Fornier while they are still valuable.
Pretty sure this happens a lot. Like Josh Jackson refused to work out for the Celtics. Kristaps Porzingis refused to workout or be interviewed by the Sixers. Luka refused to give medical records to the Kings. Mo Bamba told the Grizzlies not to draft him. Jahlil Okafor told the Sixers not to draft him. Jabari Parker allegedly 'tanked' his workout with the Cavs so they wouldn't draft him.  Hell Steph Curry refused to workout for any team except the Knicks. Kobe Bryant was telling every team in the league he would only play for the Lakers all the way back in 1996.   Long story short it happens all the time. Sometimes the player gets what they want. Sometimes they don't.
Mo Bamba has to be the player who looks least enthused whenever he's needed to play in actual NBA game.
I've suffered through Mario Hezonja and Mo Bamba.  I'm done woth projects.  The failed ones are too scarring.
And Mo Bamba was supposed to be Rudy Gobert with a 3 point shot
Mo BAMBA
I was told Mo Bamba was Rudy Gobert with a jump shot. I don’t think I can ever want a big man in the draft again
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
"That's not true. Could have gotten Sexton/Shai/MPJ in 2018 over Mo Bamba. Could have held onto Sabonis instead of trading him.  This might come down to semantics about ""franchise-changing"" but the point stands, the opportunity was there."
Mo Bamba (the song) or Mo Speights' mole? Who ya got?
It was so delicious when Trae blocked Mo Bamba from behind clean on a dunk attempt
"Haven’t watched a lot of Orlando games, is Mo Bamba a bust?"
trade Mo Bamba for Ben Simmons  Play Simmons at Center  Fultz at SG  That rookie PG who's really good at PG.
"No matter what happens to the rest of Lukas career, Mav already won the trade. If that trade didn't happen, they would have picked Mo Bamba and would have been the worst team with zero future right about now."
Trae did once block the illustrious Mo Bamba
I like Wendell Carter. I am still also in on Mo Bamba 😂😂 I think having your guys’ pick as well as the Bulls pick is going to be huge.
Mo Bamba?
Mo Bamba
"Other than Mo Bamba and Markelle Fultz, I have no idea who is even on the magic"
Mo Bamba has a song named after him that’s pretty neat
They are an NBA team.   Can't name a player on their team.  Mo Bamba?
Does Mo Bamba even get playing time? Lol
Every time I see Trae I’m reminded that in a fantasy dynasty league I drafted Mo Bamba over him and feel even worse about it
Was 100% sure OP was going to Lamelo... I’m all for the Mo Bamba revival.
Mo Bamba is the most overpowered player in 2K21. Change my mind.
"Adding in Mo Bamba is insane in 2K21, fast as hell and can block anything."
"I know the Magic had Vuc but I always thought the bigger issue was they just didn't play Mo Bamba. Maybe Magic fans would completely disagree (I'd defer to them) but I've seen Mo play both awful and pretty good in limited minutes, always thought he just needed more opportunity."
"that class gave us Luka, Trae, Ayton, the Bridges twins, SGA, and MPJ. to think that the magic picked Mo Bamba"
Luka is in the same draft class as Mo Bamba. JI was the year prior. I’m all for the Mo Bamba revival.
May I offer you one Markelle Fultz and Mo Bamba.
"This is by far the most worried I’ve been about this franchise, even more so than when our “young core” was DSJ, Harrison Barnes and probably Mo Bamba. My head is spinning rn"
Players with a better DFG% at the rim than the 61.8% Adams had:   * Wiseman * Drummond * KAT * Mo Bamba * Montrezl * Sabonis * Tristan Thompson * DeAndre Jordan * Olynyk * Baynes * Markkanen * Boucher
We can throw in Mo Bamba and an autographed Dwight jersey from 2009.
Can probably get Mo Bamba for that package.
It backfired on Mo Bamba which was kinda funny/sad. He didn't wanna workout with Memphis because they had Gasol already and thought Orlando would be a good fit for him. Instead Vooch became a 2 time all star and Mo lived in his shadow.
I wanna do it for the memes. Im sick of Kuz too.  Can we have Mo Bamba and some picks? Lol
"Im a huge Bamba fan. Honestly I think a lot of the Texas centers are great but Bamba and Turner look like they can really rim protect and space the floor.   However, I don't think Mo Bamba really does love basketball or want to be a star in this league at all costs kind of guy. But Im just one fan making an opinion with that"
"Orlando Magic have been horrible at drafting for the last 7 seasons. They picked defensive specialist Mo Bamba 6th while SGA, MPJ, Sexton, Miles, Mikal, GTJ who are more fan favored offensive players were still on the board. They picked another defensive specialist the previous year at 6th with Mitchell, Bam, John Collins yet to be picked. Hell, picking Kuzma, Dennis Smith jr, Markkanen or Monk would've been more exciting for the fans. Dallas picked DSJ 9th who is basically out of the league now but they still sold the heck out of him in that one season of inefficient volume scoring and athletic showmanship. Going back further, they picked Aaron Gordon 4th who actually did generate some buzz and I'm sure there was no shortage of Orlando fans clamoring to see him succeed in the stands early in his career. The year before that, they picked Oladipo 2nd, who played like a prototypical volume scoring lottery pick and got the fans going but apparently he was also picked for his defense- WTF Orlando! Stop picking players for their defense in the top 6 when you don't have an offensive superstar."
Kings vs Magic   Bagley vs his old team. Mo Bamba against his old team. Mid Season tournament championship preview? Probably not
Atleast mo bamba was named after a hit song
"too many to count, but i’ll throw denzel valentine and mo bamba out there as pretty rough ones"
&gt; Mo Bamba at the 5 would be crazy defensively  In theory   &gt; plus Mo can shoot  Also kind of in theory.
"Ad at the 4 and Mo Bamba at the 5 would be crazy defensively, plus Mo can shoot so it would help AD offensively"
"Yup exactly. Because no one is trading for Sexton, they are trading for the right to pay Sexton like 100 million, and that’s probably not worth a lottery pick.      If I’m the Cavs I’d rather move Love and Sexton together for like Terrence Ross and Mo Bamba than trade Sexton for like the 16th pick and keep Love on the bench."
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
mo bamba got hoes calling tho
Mo Bamba in shambles.
[Wendell Carter Jr and Mo Bamba rn](https://youtu.be/Xn79xD5_jX4)
Mo bamba will get MIP votes as a starter fs
"I’m kidding, it’s just that the perspective of the pic has him dwarfing 7 foot Mo Bamba"
Is he already the lock to start or does Bamba have a chance? Wendell is from my area and he’s a monster. I just don’t know if he’ll have to divide time with Mo. My bet is that he won’t and that he’ll get the bulk of min.
"who all is in here? I think I see JI, JT, Mo Bamba, Trae (looks the exact same lol), Fox, who am I missing?"
Yup. He blocked Mo Bamba that one time
Mo Bamba
didn't say he was the goat... technically Mo Bamba could catch both too
"What team is dumb enough to trade for Kyrie? The Kings? Kyrie for Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson? Kyrie to the Magic for Gary Harris, Mo Bamba, and Robin Lopez? Lol"
I'm pretty high on Mo Bamba. Admittedly haven't watched enough Magic's games but I feel like he doesn't get enough time to prove himself and develop. For a lottery team that's not aiming to win that should be the goal. We'll see what happens this season.
Mo Bamba has been great too
Mo Bamba had really bad effects as well.. He had to step away from the bubble iirc and get checked out
"This vid makes the rounds every week, gets 500+ upvotes, a hundred comments calling book some variation of ""a bitch"", ""lame"", ""that's why he failed in the finals"", it's all the same slanderous crap every time. Like imagine if the most random comment from your favorite player gets blown out of proportion and is continuously used as fuel to slander them. You'd think it was not only weird, but downright pathetic and delusional.   Like there was this one open gym I remember where Joel Embiid was punking the crap out of Mo Bamba talking mad shit. Imagine if every week Reddit was like ""Joel Embiid's such a dick, look how he's talking to this young player, he's not welcoming"""
That’s the Heat  You could take out Suggs and consider Butler a SF and Beal a SG but then your center is……Mo Bamba
Didn’t Mo Bamba have a really bad case last year? I thought I heard of Nassir Little in Portland too having a tough time with it. Same with Marco Rossi in the NHL but obv he’s less known
"Mo Bamba could shed the bust label this season. He hasn't really been great so far in his career, but there are a lot of encouraging signs if you look close enough, and a lot of factors that may have held him back in his career up to this point.  It's his contract year as well, and if he disappoints I imagine he's gone. I have faith though, his energy this year seems totally different, and he has all the opportunity in the world coming into the season."
Simmons was right to not want to be embarrassed like Mo Bamba by noted shot-blocker Trae Young.
Holy shit.  [Elite athletes literally aren't immune from the effects at all.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/3/3/22292213/athletes-covid-recovery-stories-jayson-tatum-mo-bamba-asia-durr)  You literally just watched an NBA season last year that demonstrated players / teams who came back from positive tests had conditioning/breathing issues.   How do you say something like that with a straight face given the very obvious observations and results available.
For Mavs:  * 2016: AJ Hammon -&gt; Jake Layman (46 -&gt; 47) * 2017: Dennis Smith Jr. -&gt; Zach Collins (9 -&gt; 10) * 2018: Trae Young -&gt; Mo Bamba (5 -&gt; 6) * 2019: Deividas Sirvydis -&gt; Daniel Gafford (37 -&gt; 38) * 2020: Josh Green -&gt; Saddiq Bey (18 -&gt; 19)

"So there goes his ""potential"" I guess.   Now give Mo Bamba some play time!"
"&gt; “There are so many other players outside of him who are opting out, I would like to think they would make a way,” says Kyrie’s aunt, Tyki Irving, who runs the seven-time All-Star’s family foundation and is one of the few people in his regular circle of advisors. “It could be like every third game. So it still gives you a full season of being interactive and being on the court, but with the limitations that they’re, of course, oppressing upon you. There can be some sort of formula where the NBA and the players can come to some sort of agreement.”  So Kyrie is not vaccinated. Not sure how one can declare themselves an advocate for the black community then not take steps to prevent a disease that disproportionately affects Black Americans. Remember when he told the Nets he was having family issues then went partying without a mask at an indoor venue for his sister's birthday? If you scroll down the article, she says even more. Please stop falling for his antics and BS.  &gt; Jonathan Isaac is known less by the average basketball fan for his play than for being that guy who stood up with his jersey on during the national anthem in the NBA bubble, while every other player on the court took a knee in a t-shirt declaring BLACK LIVES MATTER, amid a global reckoning on race and police killings. “I’m not going to sit here and point my fingers at one group of people,” Isaac, who is Black, tells RS. “I would do it again.”  &gt; The Orlando Magic’s 23-year-old starting forward is deeply religious — and proudly unvaccinated. When NBA players started lining up for shots in March, Isaac started studying Black history and watching Donald Trump’s press conferences. He learned about antibody resistance and came to distrust Dr. Anthony Fauci. He looked out for people who might die from the vaccine, and he put faith in God.  Mo Bamba, his teammate, could have easily had his career derailed by post-COVID illness and be stuck on the edge of the league if not for the Magic's tanking status. How selfish. Jonathan must have skimmed the Gospel."
"You really going to leave out james harden and Dame from team Adidas? Whats your team under armour, Greivis Vasquez, Emmanuel Mudiay, and Mo Bamba?"
That's an insult to Mo Bamba tbh
Mo Bamba is garbage and anybody who is a Magic fan that defends him is fooling themselves.  He hasn't gotten better at all.  He does the same things he's always done just in more minutes.  The amount of dropped passes or passes he just wasn't aware of in this game was astronomical.  Their is a reason Cliff stuck him on the end of the bench.  He has negative IQ.  WCJ is so superior it's not even funny.
Yep.  Mo Bamba is the same as Anthony Davis in my opinion.
"Mo Bamba  “If I finish a quarter without fouling out, I probably didn’t play hard enough… quarter in and quarter out, you’re going to be facing somebody who’s really freaking good at basketball. I like playing defense. I like smacking people. I like making guys frustrated.”"
"Him, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba, and Jonathan Isaac look like legitimate building blocks for a perennial playoff team. No wonder yall didn't mind losing Vucevic and Gordon."
KOC sticking with Mo Bamba until the end!!
He's trying so hard to make Mo Bamba a thing.
"Ah, Mo Bamba!"
KOC and Mo Bamba.    I am shocked…
"Mo Bamba on the verge of a breakthrough?  You what?    At this point KOC must be trying to talk it into existence, because Mo's game has barely improved In 3 years."
Hornets need a mobile renter that can run the break with Melo and Bridges. Plumlee is fine as a goon off the bench.   Hornets need to find a guy like a Mo Bamba or Richuan Holmes
They almost had me until I actually read what they said about Mo Bamba.  Bamba has no defensive awareness.  It's like they just look at his numbers and don't watch the games.  Bamba constantly is late in help situations and he doesn't step out on stretch bigs.  He's a bad post scorer for his size.  Is he a great shot blocker? Yes absolutely.  Is he a good shooter?  Sure.  Is he a good rebounder? Yup.  But he only gets blocks because dudes just drive right into his pathway and he jumps at everything which is why he fouls a lot.  WCJ has taken a much more significant leap compared to Bamba this year.  I actually trust Wendell to make shots more than Bamba and at least Wendell is always in position on defense to succeed.  But they're on the money about Cole.
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
I would like to place a vote for Mo Bamba. Thank you for your time.
"Look at Mo Bamba. Top 5 pick based on high ceiling and 1% athleticism, came to the NBA super raw and is only now becoming a positive impact player. It's not a one to one but it can absolutely take that long for these bigs with little experience."
Lmao Mo Bamba had 1-2 good games.. everyone was like IT'S HIS BREAKOUT YEAR and shit... He's just ass dude..1 for 6 as a center
&gt; If you have a shot at a Giannis/AD type long switchable defensive anchor you don’t pass that up  So what you’re telling me is you would’ve drafted Mo Bamba with the #1 pick in the 2018 draft?   but fr hindsight is 20/20. Don’t act like you knew all along if Cade busts or not (which btw it’s been 2 damn games) and be saying this shit.
Our defense was fine through 3 quarters. We were on pace to hold them below 100 after 3 quarters.   What hurt us was:  1) Our best defender Jaden McDaniels fouling out very early. Wagner went off in the 4th once McDaniels went out.  2) DLo getting hurt. Having to run a very undersized JMac out there for big minutes in crunch time just didn't work. Which is why the Magic's guards went off on us.  3) Naz Reid getting destroyed (and injured) by Mo Bamba. Still pissed that wasn't a flagrant foul. Fucking ridiculous.  4) The Ref's were so incredibly one sided for basically 3/4th's of the game. At one point the Magic had like 15 FT's to the Wolves 2.  5) Our offense is a mess. I think that's really the biggest problem. They need to figure that out before anything else.
"Oh yeah most definitely, I was just talking about the rookies but Cole playing well and Mo Bamba finally showing out makes me very happy too."
Would’ve had another assist if bamba didn’t run around with his head in the clouds too. Had a fast break that he threw up to mo and mo wasn’t even looking for the ball . Went right by him
Celtics gonna make Mo Bamba look like prime Shaquille O’Neal
"Mo Bamba is a long, lanky dude so I think part of it all is just that he looks slop and disinterested because his limbs are like telephone poles.   But he's been much better this season and is having more of an impact than ever before. Some lower body strength would help him a lot too."
"Too soon to have any firm conclusions about Mosley, but there's nothing glaringly bad right now. He's getting more out of rookies than anyone expected, has helped Mo Bamba look like an NBA player, and his rotations are getting better every game.   I think Mosley is going to be a fine coach, just too soon to know exactly how good he'll be."
"We will probably ramp up Isaac very slowly, but when everyone is 100% I think Isaac and Bamba will start.   Wendell has been better than Mo, but Mo plays his best basketball when Cole is on the floor with him (they basically grew up together). I think Cole has to start, and so Bamba should be in the lineup with him.  I think regardless of starting or not, all 3 will play significant minutes."
I wish Mo Bamba could see the energy and effort rhe rest of the starters play with and match it.  Also Cole for MIP.  Franz for ROY
"Love all the Magic players reaction, Mo Bamba couldn’t believe it"
Magic fans - I've seen that both WCJ and Mo Bamba are in the starting lineup. How is their fit together? Are both shooting 3's?  I also know that Franz is on the taller side - does he look equipped to defend the 3 in today's league? I know the big riff on Chuma was that he's more of a 4 and may not have the lateral quickness to handle the 3.
"They're surprised that a 20-year-old draftee given 1 year of backup minutes isn't a good NBA player?  I, for one, am shocked.  This is literally the Mo Bamba situation all over again, except Orlando wasn't so stupid to not accept his team option."
Mo Bamba and...... take everybody else
So we shouldn't trade for Mo Bamba at the deadline?
Mo bamba
Mo bamba is actually getting minutes now
It's amazing what playing for a contract does for these players lol. Mo Bamba is also looking solid!  How has Hunter been this year? He's the guy I was expecting a ton out of.
Kevin Mo Bamba
&gt;Mo Bamba is just a bad  No slander on MOBA MBA please
"Oh I’m sure he is, but it’s unlikely that now that he’s put it together he’s going to just revert back to the old bamba  This version of Mo is an above average starter in the league with potential to improve further, the mo from years 1-3 probably wasn’t getting the QO"
"Not sure how much y’all watched mo bamba before this season, but he did not pass the eye test or any statistical tests before this season, that’s completely revisionist  He genuinely looked lost out there on offense and defense, couldn’t finish, rebound, or defend (sold out too heavy for blocks). There’s a reason he had such terrible advanced and normal stats"
Jamaal Mosley had been one of the worst coaches so far this year.  I get our bench is bad but that just means just have to play the starters 34 plus minutes each game and learn to properly stagger them.  Suggs was awesome on defense.  His effort is ridiculous and whenever he is out the game we luck lost.  Also Mo Bamba is just a bad defensive player.  He needs to be on the bench because we struggle to score on the second unit and that's his best asset.  WCJ needs to play more.  Idk if he is hurt.  But it's frustrating watching winnable games fall away.  If Cliff was coach  he wouldn't have let these games slip away because bad defensive players wouldn't get any minutes.
No.  He sucks at staggering.  No reason we don't have one of Suggs or Cole on the court at all times.  The Blazers  used to do it with CJ and Dame.  They both don't need to be so attached at the hip.  Don't get me started on the abomination of Robin Lopez and Mo Bamba lineups.
"After non-stop talk about Mo Bamba last season, he hasn't even brought it up much this season."
"Look at Mo Bamba, Randle"
Kevin mO’ Bamba
"I always liked Mo Bamba so I'm glad he's showing what he can do, especially since he's not stuck behind Vucevic anymore. Vucevic being traded to Chicago was the best move for both teams imo. Hopefully this trade turns into a win-win for everyone."
"Right now the magic have,  Franz Wagner   Moe Wagner  Mo Bamba  Wendell Carter Jr   Michael Carter Williams"
Looks like all those “Mo Bamba has added 15 pounds of muscle” memes over the past few years have paid off.

Markelle Fultz   Cole Anthony   RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke  Jonathan Isaac  Wendell Carter Jr   Mo Bamba  is a solid core plus a top 5 pick hopefully added
Mo Bamba is a monster wtf
IS MO BAMBA LEGIT?!?!?
We waived him just to get Mo Bamba minutes-- we deadass had to to waive him so Steve Clifford would play Mo Bamba
Mo Bamba has arrived.
No way are we trading Dalano. I’d do Mo Bamba for Chris Boucher straight up.
"Shoutout to Mo ""40 Minutes, 18 Rebounds, 0 Fouls"" Bamba"
"Game Notes   - Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.   - Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly   - Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.   - Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)   - Chris Boucher finally had a good game.   - Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.   - Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)"
raps need to trade for mo bamba
mo bamba 🐐 got 12 points and 13 boards and 3 blocks
Is Mo Bamba playing well or is he just a box score baller? Haven’t watched any Magic games yet but he seems to be putting up decent numbers
Mo Bamba looks like he enjoys doing his job as much as I enjoy doing my job
"Vucevic, Fournier, and Gordon all developed nicely here, Fultz basically rejuvenated his career, Isaac developed nicely despite always being injured, Mo Bamba has looked really good here this year after struggling his first couple of years, and Wendell Carter took a big step forward this year and the last  I don’t even care that you’re wrong, just don’t be a pussy while taking shots lmao"
Probably Mo Bamba
