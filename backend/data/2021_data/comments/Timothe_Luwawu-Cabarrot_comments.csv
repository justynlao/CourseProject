Had to look up who the hell TLC is.  Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot for anyone else wondering.
Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot should not even be a allowed to have arms to shoot the basketball with. He should be dismembered and fitted with mechanical limbs like Edward Scisorhands.  This sub probably.
Highlight of the game was the Baptist dunk and getting to listen to Nique try to pronounce Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot all game
It's surprising how much coaches love Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot.
They have a few tiny contracts they can couple. Maybe throw in a 2nd rounder depending on who they put together:  Shamet + Tyler Johnson  Tyler Johnson + Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot  Tyler Johnson + Shumpert + 2nd rounder  Tyler Johnson + Noah Vonleh + 2nd rounder  Shamet + Noah Vonleh  Basically any combo that involves either Tyler Johnson or Landry Shamet will work. These are the most likely options imo.
"To be fair, I look at the players that played last night. Joe Harris, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot...who the fuck are these players??? I've never heard of them."
"The reporter was clearly asking Bullock the other day about the Nets' Big 3 of Jeff Green, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, and Alize Johnson."

"On one of Reggie Perry's 3s, Marv called him Timothe Luwawu Cabarrot. There is not an ounce of resemblance between the 2. What is he doing calling NBA games at this point?"

"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"

I won't stand for this Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot slander.
"&gt;Slovenia had several complaints with the officiating and particularly with a play halfway through the fourth period and the score tied at 78 where Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot blocked Jaka Blazic’s layup attempt. Blazic protested that it was a goaltending violation and he received a technical foul.  &gt;Doncic, who registered a historic third-ever triple-double in Olympic Games history, was often seen complaining to the referees throughout the game."

The refs were bad today, but not biased."
&gt;Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot  The highlight of the early season Hawks games was getting to hear Dominique try to pronounce this mans name in back to back games.
"(translator's note: TLC means Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot)  Personal aside: This is why I suggest using my patented system of using the first two letters of each name (in this care, TiLuCa) it takes the same amount of syllables to say, but provides twice as much information, thus doubling the chances for reader comprehension. The only downside is that it's pretty corny, plus how much longer it takes to type, but my predictive text already has players like MiPoJu and TaHoTu saved lol"
"They have more than 3 NBA players on their team. There’s Gobert, Batum, Fournier, Nando (who did play in the NBA), Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Frank Ntilikina"

"For anyone wondering,  The 2016 Miami pick was Timothe Luwawu Cabarrot  The 2016 OKC pick was Furkan Korkmaz.  Both were just ahead of Siakam.  The Kings pick is when the swapped Tatum for Fultz. (I think)"
"16 Miami pick became Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot  16 OKC pick became Furkan Korkmaz  Kings future 1st round pick and the pick swap with the Kings were packaged together to get Fultz, they became Tatum and, iirc, Langford"
