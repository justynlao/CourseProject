So let’s start Moritz Wagner

"The Wizards have shooters. They aren't being utilized correctly. See below with 2019 3p % stats:  Bertrans (42.4%), Beal (35.3%), Neto (38.6% and 45% this season so far), Bryant (40.7%), Rui (28.7% but shooting 100% this year so far), Deni (NA but shooting 47.6% this year so far) can all shoot and probably in that order for efficiency  Then you have guys like: Troy Brown Jr (34.1%), Isaac Bonga (35.2%), Ish Smith (36.7%), Robin Lopez (33.3%), Moritz Wagner (31.3%), Anthony Gill (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason), and Garrison Matthews (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason)  All these dudes can shoot too.  The problem is you need some semblance of an offensive scheme generating semi-open looks and the Wizards don't have that."
Fine  u/celtics get:  Bradley Beal  Davis Bertans  Moritz Wagner  u/WashWizards get:  Kemba Walker  Tristan Thompson  Javonte Green  2021 - RD 1  2021 - RD 2  2021 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/qr\_UOhwtQ
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
Lebron does the same shit. Difference between Lebron/Luka and Moritz Wagner is that they’ve earned the right to complain.
Franz Wagner. Mo’s brother who’s a wing and way better than Moritz.
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Moritz Wagner
Smh Embiid ducking Moritz Wagner once again
SGA + Zion. Wiseman + Moritz Wagner.
"""The Raptors have announced that they have waived Paul Watson and Yuta Watanabe for screwing with the tank, and have signed Moritz Wagner in their place"""
"End of bench guys (minutes played and +/-):  Carsen Edwards: 7:23, -18  Moritz Wagner: 5:11, -20  Aaron Nesmith: 4:26, -17  Semi Ojeleye: 3:43, -17  Tremont Waters: 3:43, -17"
"Uh okay? I'm not denying that Magic is super charming, he was just a horrible front office executive. He was bad in his role on his team in this stint and he was equally bad when he tried to be a head coach years ago. Not everyone is Larry Bird and capable of shifting roles and being successful without dropping a beat.   Wasting a pick on Moritz Wagner with better options on board (his pick, based on all reports at the time). Throwing in Russell to shed cap space when we could have gotten more value. Being dead-set on Lonzo as the future before realizing that the kool-aid was missing something. Muscala trade for no good reason giving up an asset in Zubac. 5 total players that we kept from '18-19 onto our '19-20 championship roster.   We cleaned out once he left and won a championship, that's not a coincidence. Magic in his role consistently made bad roster decisions and we mostly got by on sheer luck with high draft picks giving us assets down the line for AD. Great basketball player, horrible front office executive."
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick.

Moritz. Wagner.
"List needs more Ersan Ilyasova, Moritz Wagner, Marreese Speights"
"We've made the best pick available three drafts in a row and now we're getting Mobley.  We got Jarrett Allen for free.   Larry Nance is one of the most valuable assets in the league and we got him for Isaiah Thomas and a pick that turned into Moritz Wagner (we also got Clarkson in that trade; he was traded for two seconds and Dante Exum, our main contribution to the Allen trade).  Everyone loves to dunk on the Cavs but we're recovering much more quickly than other rebuilding teams.  If Love didn't suck we'd probably be looking at playoffs next year."
Why stop there? Get Franz and Moritz Wagner in there.
What about Moritz Wagner lol
Moritz “Ziege” Wagner
Bulls legend Moritz Wagner
"lmao at some of these comments being upvoted, showing how /r/nba has negative bball iq. Dude literally just won a championship playing center.   Magic Johnson traded Zubac for pocket lint and overruled our staff to draft fucking Moritz Wagner over Mitchell Robinson"
Orlando Magic starting lineup:  Cole Anthony -  Gary Harris -  Dwayne Bacon - Moritz Wagner - Mo Bamba   Team Serbia starting lineup:  Stefan Jović - Bogdan Bogdanović - Nemanja Bjelica - Nikola Jokić - Boban Marjanović  Why exactly do people think Orlando could beat Serbia?
"Notably, he also left simmons off of his all Nba team and put Westbrook on the third team. But Jokic was first team for him. So his all-nba ballot isn’t even consistent with this MVP voting.  He also voted for Schroeder and Theis for All defense second team. I believe there are only 5 active German players - those two, Maxi Kleber, Isaac bonga, and Moritz Wagner. Bonga and Wagner basically don’t get minutes.  So he also voted for 66% of the eligible German players for the all defense team (no one else gave theis a vote and I think only one other person voted for Schroeder).  His Twitter feed has basically nothing about basketball other than his about info that says he is based in LA covering US sports for a German publication. But his entire feed is like soccer and slalom and stuff.  Feels like this dude should bit have an NBA vote. There’s plenty of intentional media guys who are way more dialed in."
"Berlin, ima try:  Heiko Schaffartzik  Niels Giffey  Franz Wagner  Jan Hendrik Jagla  Moritz Wagner"
"Moritz Wagner and Hartenstein. I want them on a team with Schröder, maybe get a few Bundesliga players to boot, and bam - they could really contend for [that 2022 title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroBasket_2022). The finals are in Berlin, even!"
"Moritz Wagner &gt; Luka Doncic     Germany will win, and Luka fanboys will cry."
"We could make a take one, get one free special offer, with a cuckoo clock and a can of sauerkraut to boot, offering Moritz Wagner, Hartenstein, Theis and Zipser."
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"
"Thomas Bryant, Moritz Wagner, Josh Hart, I can go on and on and on"
Lmao they had to use stills of moritz Wagner
Moritz Wagner - Berlin
Here's the list from 2019-2020. A lot of the same guys show up on both.   Ante Žižić  Cody Zeller   Moritz Wagner  Nikola Vučević  Noah Vonleh     Omari Spellman    Dwight Powell        Kelly Olynyk         Nicolò Melli       Kevon Looney      Frank Kaminsky    Nikola Jokić      Willy Hernangómez  Dewan Hernandez       Harry Giles     Cristiano Felício      Andre Drummond    Ed Davis            Marques Bolden  Jonah Bolden         Ryan Anderson
"In the past 2 years, Wizards had 7 former Laker Players:  Isaac Bonga  Moritz Wagner  Thomas Bryant  Kyle Kuzma   Montrezl Harrell   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Joel Ayayi  If you jump back one more year, you can add Isaiah Thomas to the list too."

Franz Wagner is only 20. You're thinking of Moritz Wagner
"I'm not a draft scout 😂  I just meant the name, that mo Wagner might drag Franz down because of how he panned out. And I'm still high on Moritz."
Miles and Mikael Bridges…  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels…  Franz and Moritz Wagner….  Shit’s getting confusing.
Year one he didn’t play w/ another “Superstar”  Lonzo Ball  Michael Beasley  Isaac Bonga  Reggie Bullock  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Alex Caruso  Tyson Chandler  Josh Hart  Andre Ingram  Brandon Ingram  Jemerrio Jones  Kyle Kuzma  Scott Machado  JaVale McGee  Mike Muscala  Svi Mykhailiuk  Rajon Rondo  Lance Stephenson  Moritz Wagner  Johnathan Williams  Ivica Zubac
