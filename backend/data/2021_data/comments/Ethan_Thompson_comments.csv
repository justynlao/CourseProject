"lol. I follow the marcum thompson/ethan strauss relgiously and they have talked at length about how kerr feels about harden.    Beyond what is said behind closed doors, kerr has criticized harden more than any other players publicly."

"Most of this stuff is hearsay the kind of fantasy scenarios Ethan Strauss spins up when he has to hit wordcount for his essays.  Steph himself said **on the record** that he offered to take a paycut and the Warriors declined.      https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Steph-Curry-offered-to-take-a-pay-cut-to-stay-11728104.php  &gt; In an article from Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic, Curry said that he offered to take a pay cut to help the Warriors keep their core players together. But he was turned down.  &gt; ""I actually asked [Warriors GM] Bob [Myers],"" Curry told The Athletic. ""If I were to take a discount — at any number, I don't know what it would be — how much of a difference would that make for us to be able to sign other guys.... But mine didn't matter."""
Yeah.   Fools on here talking about the dude that got worked by Ethan Thompson like he’s Luka and Harden’s love child.
They aren't ready. Ethan strauss and Marcus Thompson talked about the debauchery that takes place right now that is kept under wraps
Ayo Dosunmu or Ethan Thompson
"Not too surprising. His articles have been more focused on analyzing TV ratings these days. I just hope he stays on as a co-host of Warriors Plus Minus because I enjoy the dynamic of Anthony Slater, Marcus Thompson, Tim Kawakami, and Ethan Strauss"
"&gt; If their relationship were a marriage, it would be best described as cold.   ￼￼&gt; He's an organization man, someone who constantly seeks credit for the various layers of Golden State's operation that fans can't see.  These are snippets from the Ethan Strauss excerpt I pasted in my other comment. The main Warriors reporters have dropped lots of these sorts of tidbits over the years on podcasts/articles and said that Lacob and Curry don’t have a great relationship. Just from memory, some of the articles by Marcus Thompson and Ethan Strauss about the construction of Chase Centre have Lacob/Curry tidbits. Lacob made KD the poster boy for Chase Centre so a couple of the articles/podcasts that touch on why it wasn’t Steph and discuss his relationship with Lacob. There is no direct quote from Lacob saying “I resent Steph Curry”, j ust like there are no similar quotes from Jeff Krause about MJ. Fans that’ve been following the Warriors very closely, reading the main beat reporters and listening to Joe Lacob interview over the years will tell you the same thing, it’s a common theme among Warriors Twitter."
"Lacob gave an interview to the New York Times in 2016 and implied Steph gets too much credit and said the Warriors are winning because Lacob built an organization that was “light years ahead” and it was his master plan, even though he inherited Curry.  Marcus Thompson and Ethan Strauss have written a bunch of articles hinting at the same thing. Lacob wanted to lowball Steph in 2017 after Steph just came off winning 2 MVPs while making 11M/year and had to be talked out of it by Bob Myers. Lacob made KD the poster boy for chase centre because he could take credit for KD signing under his ownership."
I’ve never posted anything about Cade.   All my comments about him are far more reasonable than his cheerleaders. He’s a good player who looks like he might be a really good shooter. He’s clearly not going to be in the top tier athletically when it comes to nba players.   Unless you think Ethan Thompson is an explosive NBA  athlete or something.
Reminder that Ethan Thompson spanked Cade in the tournament
"Oregon State, shooters are really lacking. While the departure of Ethan Thompson has allowed for more ball dominant players I just don’t think we have the core to really allow Simmons to shine. I know NIL is a big step forward, but I don’t think profits from that alone would be enough to satisfy Ben, whose accustomed to a healthy NBA salary, especially considering Corvallis is a small market."
