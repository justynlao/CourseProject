"Show me 1 person with JT Thor over Kuminga besides yourself?   Or even show me 1 person saying Kuminga outside the lottery.   I get that NBA media can pick favourites, but acting like Kuminga shouldn’t be in the lottery is just showing how little research you have done. Or do you think that you know more than people who have been scouting this guy since grade 10?"
"&gt;And if you think Kuminga is in JT Thor range than that means every team in the NBA as well as every analyst disagrees with your evaluation.  I mean, sure, NBA teams are terrible at drafting once you get past like the top 2-3.  NBA big draft media is also the worst of any sport by a good margin and largely just involves repeating the stuff they've heard from teams over and over. There's barely anyone at any of the big places grinding film and actually forming their own opinion."
"I’m not,   The G-League is literally a NCAA all-Star league where the players had years to develop and work on their game.   The only real knock on the league is the primary focus of the league isn’t to win, it’s to develop players.   The average player in the G-League would one of the best players in the NCAA. An average player in the G-League couldn’t make a G-League roster.   His individual defence wasn’t awful. His lateral quickness has question marks, but saying it was awful is a major hyperbole.   And if you think Kuminga is in JT Thor range than that means every team in the NBA as well as every analyst disagrees with your evaluation."
"&gt; Way higher level of competition.  You are vastly overselling the G-League lol. It's better than college, but not by that much. It's between the NCAA and all the overseas leagues in skill level.   &gt;so if his question mark is his team defence  It's not, his individual defense was awful too.   &gt;Well he is at best the 5th pick, so the consensus on him is more that he is in the 5-8 range.  He would be closer to JT Thor range for me."

"Barnes and Siakam are def not similar coming into the league. Nobody really knows what Siakam can develop into or what his floor might be. If there’s a guy in this draft you wanna compare to Siakam as a raw prospect with high motor it’s JT Thor.  Scottie Barnes is not a raw prospect, he has a higher floor, is your modern 4 that can guard multiple position and actually has good handle to dribble drive and make plays for others with pretty good vision and high passing iq. There some Draymond Green and Giannis Antetokoumnpo to his game in that regard"
I agree.  I’d rather have Green and take someone like JT Thor late in the first round.  Mobley’s game doesn’t scream generational to me.  Greens work ethic is also incredible. It should honestly be a no brained at this point.  Drafting big men is too risky
Hell yes. Portland insta-rebuild led by JT Thor!
JT Thor is 2 years away from being 2 years away.
JT Thor is from my area. Biased but I think he can be a really good switchable defender at the 4 spot in the league with some offensive upside
"JT Thor should be able lock up 3s and 4s and be a good help defender in the paint as well, not really like Wood (though I admittedly haven’t seen much of Wood, I don’t think he’s that kind of player).   I love him as a high upside prospect and have him 19th on my current big board."
Those are 2 guys the Rockets have interviewed for the picks at 23 and 24 and I love both  &amp;#x200B;  JT Thor is CWood light  &amp;#x200B;  Springer is your protitipical super athletic guard with a developing jumshot
"I would've associated JT Thor with the Thunder, not the Magic."
Somebody go follow JT Thor and help him out.
"Fun fact, the JT part of JT Thor is actually short for Jalen Thor."
"Jokhow Panom ""JT"" Thor"
Imagine a superstar athlete having the name JT Thor
"besides ours:  Yves Pons, JT Thor, Sharife Cooper, Cade Cunningham"
JT Thor with the Love and Thunder!! This needs to be the call on his dunks
Lazy ass tweet. There is actually a JT Thor that was drafted by the Hornets. Should have waited until they played each other.
Where is JT Thor?
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Not even sad on Bouknight and Sengun. Presti fumbled on JT Thor
Don’t forget about JT Thor he has bounce too
"Please do not forget about JT Thor that dude may be trash, but he’s a guaranteed highlight machine."
JT Thor is great pickup. There’s no way he’s not a serviceable player in 2-3 years.
thor as in jt thor?
"I figured JT Thor might be in competition for one, but if hes going to be main roster outright, good for him"
"I disagree  Plumlee one is actually the deal I am fine with and actually quite like. Cody Zeller, while better on both ends, was gonna leave, he made it clear. We needed a stopgap early doors and Mitch got one while also moving up twenty spots in the draft to select imo the best value pick of the four selections with JT Thor at 37  While Plumlee is very poor on defense, he at least brings similar stuff to Cody on offense with his athleticism and drive and kick ability. His contract is fine too    -----   Not extending your 23 lottery pick guard after he has shown improvement on both sides of the ball year after year is just so shortsighted   Devonte' too, like whatever, we got a lotto protected first. But now we're stuck with what Brad Wanamaker? Grant Riller? as the backup. George Hill is worse than both those players  The fact is all the reasonable free agents we can get are worse than Monk/Te' in my opinion    ----   All of his decisions I would deem more acceptable if it's clear we were going on a rebuilding route, but then the question becomes if you're rebuilding why sign Hayward, who has hay and chalk making up his knees, to 30m AAV while also waiving and stretching Batum (the most ridiculous thus far).    We are reeking towards mediocrity (like at best a 6 seed) for the next couple years or so unless LaMelo becomes idk someone like a Trae Young level player of impact on the offensive end. And while he is a very very promising point guard, I'm skeptical that we have anyone on our roster who can go get you 25+ PPG and be a superstar like that"
actually JT Thor is ours. He's part of that Mason Plumlee to Charlotte deal.  So y'all with have to deal with the Thornets now
"What bout the man, the myth, the legend, JT Thor"
I know this is a bit late but I want to see r/nba's reaction to this trade and I can't seem to see this post here yet. I personally think that it's crazy that Detroit is giving Charlotte a serviceable center and JT Thor (the 37th pick) just so we'd get the cap space for Plumlee.
"Brandon Boston is wrong, Ziaire Williams is wrong, Isaiah Todd is wrong, Miles McBride is wrong, JT Thor is wrong, Jared Butler is wrong, Greg Brown is wrong, Balsa Kopravica is wrong. I don't think there are many accurate teams on his list lol."
"Man, so jealous of the JT Thor pick"
JT THOR ⚡️ 🔨
How dare you bring up Charlotte without naming our savior JT Thor
"I was gonna say Quentin Grimes, JT Thor, and Bones Hyland  Cool names 👌  Daishen Nix sounds like an RNB artist from the early 2000s lol"
"Yup. Coulda had a line up of  Giddey, sga, dort, poku, sengun  Jalen Johnson, maledon, jt Thor, etc"
"Gotta say I’m really disappointed with the JT Thor pick in the second round. He’s extremely extremely raw and we’re overloaded with raw big men who really aren’t NBA players. With players like Butler/Cooper/Livers/Ayayi on the board, it feels like a wasted pick."
Shit jt Thor got potential
"Plumlee/Kai Jones/JT Thor/Vernon Carey/Nick Richards/PJ Washington is the full list of guys who’ll likely play at C. Richards is absolutely ass so I doubt he’s on the roster past next season, PJ is a smallball 5, Plumlee is the vet/likely starter and the rest are projects."
JT Thor
CBS says JT Thor to Charlotte? Didn't say a word about the pick on TV just so they could do more ads while picks are happening.
JT Thor not going to the fuckin' *Thunder* is a crime.
Jokic got drafted during a Taco Bell commercial so this bodes well for JT Thor
Koby I'm begging you... Buy a pick and grab JT Thor.
"Alright Cavs, go buy a second round pick and grab JT Thor."
"Calling it now, JT Thor gonna be a gem."
Imagine JT Thor on OKC. I would Pay for that jersey!
I hope JT Thor becomes really good because that's a freaking awesome name
This is JT Thor erasure
"4 international prospect everybody should be picking right now: Usman, JT Thor, Vrenz, Alex Antetokoumnpo"
JT Thor and Vrenz are first round picks if these GM know how to assess talents I’m telling you!!
Aight time for JT THOR baby
JT thor might end up being a 2nd round STEAL
"Bold Predictions:  - Jared Butler will be a border line all-star  - Bouknight is a bust  - Bones Hyland, Trey Murphy III, JT Thor, Neemias Queta, Isiah Livers are the 2nd round steals"
JT Thor and Quinten Grimes too

Star: Davion Mitchell  Bust: Corey Kispert  Steal: JT Thor
Jokhow is somehow even doper   Jokhow “JT” Thor is really badass
JT Thor will be a top 10 player in the class
"I've seen JT Thor anywhere from 15-40 in mock drafts. Guy has crazy potential, I think it would be a shame if he dropped that far, but great for Mikwaukee obviously."
Avenger Division  JT Thor
"Bucks have the 31st pick while feels like a pretty volatile place. The dream is Ayo Dosunmu or JT Thor drop past the first round, but more realistically hoping for Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes."
"I like Bones Hyland, Josh Primo, Tre Mann, JT Thor and Aaron Henry"
JT Thor. Because if there was ever a more generic 2k name out there
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"
JT Thor and Vrenz would be my picks for any potential steals
JT Thor got some high upside i like him. would’ve liked roko pkracin as well if he didn’t opt out.
"There’s a ton of interesting guards that could work out, for bigger guys, kai Jones or jt Thor are raw but have high ceilings"
JT Thor or Sengun  Expect Sengun to not be there by the time we pick and Thor to be an incredible steal for some team that wont be us
Maybe they grab JT Thor at 17 and let him back up JV for a year before he leaves. Finding a serviceable center isn’t the hardest thing in today’s league.
Herb Jones or maybe JT Thor if we get a bit lucky

"This draft from 20-40 is definitely pretty fluid. JT Thor is a pretty decent pick for you guys, raw offensively but gifted physically and projects to be a good defender right away. Good high upside youngster for an aging core (outside of Giannis). Some other good picks I can think of for you guys would be Quentin Grimes and Deuce McBride. Good two-way players who can shoot the hell out of the ball."
Honestly it's amazing detail - I've been reading a bunch this evening. Bucks have got the 31st pick and it seems so volatile since a lot of mock drafts show up players who in others seem to either go undrafted or be 1st round picks. JT Thor is the only one I've seen consistently around that spot but maybe it's just what I've been looking at.
JT Thor comes out on stage with a hammer.
"Charlotte &gt; Washington &gt; Toronto   Idk why this isn't the consensus. Let's just look at the rosters real quick and see who people are over or under rating.  Charlotte: Lamelo, Rozier, Hayward, Bridges, Washington, Ish, Bouknight, Oubre, Plumlee, Jalen McDaniels, JT Thor, Kai Jones  Washington: Dinwiddie, Beal, Kuzma, Hachimura, Bryant, Neto, Aaron Holiday, KCP, Avdija, Kispert, Bertans, Trez, Gafford   Toronto: VanVleet, GTJ, Anunoby, Siakam, Boucher, Dragic, Barnes, Svi, Flynn, Watanabe, Dekker, Birch, Achiuwa  I see the Raptore as CLEARLY the worst of these teams. I think Charlotte is the the best, but tbh Washington is being underrated pretty heavily by most people in this sub."
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
Shabazz Muhammed and JT Thor
"He shouldn't be a benchwarmer, but Jalen McDaniels has shown a lot of promise as a lanky, athletic defender who can play 3-5. If we're looking at true benchwarmers, Vernon Carey is our second round pick from last year who shown offensively at Duke and in the G-League bubble. There was some hope he could develop a shot, which looks unlikely, but the guy can really score and is a good rebounder. JT Thor is another second-round big man with shooting promise, he's a rookie and raw as hell so I doubt he gets minutes in our 4/5 glut but he has a good amount of upside."
how about JT Thor?
"I wouldn’t have until I saw it associated with ORL. The next team. How do you know of JT Thor, and why would you know of him and not use him for OKC?"
"&gt;The talent discrepancy was also for sure larger than it is now so while you had to go against guys like Walt Belemy you also got to rebound against easier players some of the time as well.  I would actually argue the talent discrepancy is somewhat the same, the average height since 1950 has only increased 1 inch. Nowadays getting a rebound over Porzingis is harder than JT Thor. It's been that way for a long long time."
"charlotte - it’s almost like they are trying to build the most exciting team first, and a winning team second. bouknight is legit, but there were better players available than kai jones and jt thor. the organization said “fuck it” and drafted them based on athleticism and stylistic fit with lamelo, and im here for it. i think it’s easier to build a team that’s exciting every night rather than a team that wins every night."
You misspelled JT Thor
[Serious] Why will JT Thor make a run for Rookie of the Year
"As a Hornets fan, I’d be willing to give Hayward to Philly if we could get at least one unprotected Minnesota pick + McDaniels + Naz Reid. Hayward played really well last year (best player on our team), but his timeline doesn’t match ours and his contract could age poorly. McDaniels/Reid would give us a great young core and some depth at forward, plus I’m not all that into Kai Jones/Vernon Carey/JT Thor as our Cs of the future.   This take will be more controversial amongst our fanbase, but I’d give Terry to Philly too if it meant getting Malik Beasley, Terry/Beasley occupy a similar niche but Beasley is younger and cheaper."
Wym you already have JT Thor
We didn’t sign him. The Pistons gave us JT Thor to take his contract
What happened to JT Thor 😂 a lot of people wanted to use a loterry pick on him
"Kai Jones, JT Thor and even Nick Richards all not getting playing time seems rough. Plumlee is good but limited and can get lit up in certain matchups. Those guys can’t be that much worse."
