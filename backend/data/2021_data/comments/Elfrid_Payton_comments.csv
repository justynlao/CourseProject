"IQ is good, but he's no Elfrid Payton"
"Other names include: George Hill, TJ McConnell, Elfrid Payton, Delon Wright, Ricky Rubio, Brad Wanamaker, Tyrese Halliburton and Alex Caruso"
Elfrid Payton don't need that interaction lol
"I’d honestly rather just trade Payton for Lonzo if that’s possible at this point even though he statistically worse because I at least expect him to be a better passer and defender. Elfrid is a complete liability on both ends of the floor and the game really only starts once we’re already in a hole because of him and Quickley comes in. The fact Lonzo is pretty passive compared to Payton may honestly be a blessing since we’d rather have RJ Julius Burks Rivers and IQ taking the shots anyway. If we could throw in Knox, Frank (who’s expendable were we to acquire Lonzo) or Bullock and like a second rounder for Redick, even better. At the end of the day though we’re gonna draft a pg and a sf in the lottery so it won’t really matter but I think Lonzo might make some strides here with defense being his strength and it playing to Thibs style."
Elfrid Payton with 18 minutes without an assist along with atrocious defense thats my starting point guard
There is nothing I care less about than Elfrid Payton and whether he starts for the Knicks or not
here to react to elfrid payton being named a starter again
"**NEW YORK KNICKS**  Pleasant: Julius Randle by a MILE, Quickley honorable mention for being amazing as a #25 pick  Unpleasant: Obi Toppin, he hasn't been terrible and he's been injured but he's far from advertised, honorable mention to Elfrid Payton but I don't think he really counts as a ""surprise"" he just sucks"
I know it's probably a troll trying to come accross as an Elfrid Payton burner account. [But this sure does look like one...](https://twitter.com/knicksfan63/with_replies)
Oh right bc Elfrid Payton is such a great player lmfao. Seriously how dense are you buddy? Frank is a better defender &amp; shooter. Elf is better at setting up the offense but Randle &amp; RJ are better at that than him. There is no good reason to continue giving minutes to a journeyman PG who won't be on our team next season.
Explain how Elfrid Payton is any better than Frank. There is legitimately no argument. He has a better handle but we're better off with Randle and RJ running the offense over Elf. Frank is unquestionably a better defender and 3 point shooter.
"Yeah, elfrid Payton is just ass though. I’d much rather play a ton more through RJ and Randle and let frank start and do secondary ball handler / spot up shooter. Every minute Payton is out there hurts the team in some way."
"As a Knicks fan, I’d prefer DRose to Elfrid Payton as a starter"
You’re incapable of reading between the lines.   If Trae was so good he should’ve been able to overcome his team being worse than the god awful Knicks last year.   I mean he by himself should be better than Randle &amp; Elfrid Payton right?   Wouldn’t you think so?
I don't post though.   If you mean my comments on Russ I'll always hype him up even if he plays like elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton and Eric Bledsoe
Tf are you looking at. We’re #3 in Def Rtg. It’s our offense that holds this team back (namely Elfrid Payton)   https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1
Oh Lord. Even Caruso has higher value than Elfrid Payton imho.
May I offer you one Elfrid Payton?
Also he's doing this starting next to Elfrid Payton who cannot shoot for shit and Mitchell Robinson who cannot shoot for shit. He's a primary slasher who has to constantly deal with a packed paint and zone defense every night and has looked great the last 10 games or so doing it. Imagine what he could do with some floor spacing.
Can't have off games if you never have on games -- Elfrid Payton
"Elfrid Payton is a league-mandated nerf to the Knicks, can't have them going 82-0"
Elfrid Payton is now the most hated man in NYC
"Also:   -2 four point plays, one got ruled not a foul but we count it  -Swam on the court  -Dunked on Jarrett Allen   -Hit a buzzer beater 3 to end the 3rd quarter  -Had 12.5x the points of starting point guard and Knicks legend Elfrid Payton"
elfrid payton chose to have a shitty haircut and now his hair looks fine. trae young will look like an ugly baby for the rest of time
Look at Elfrid Payton. He cut that stupid thing off and people aren't making fun of him.
Elfrid Payton
"Best bad player just because he fills up the box score with assists and rebounds imo  There are few players in the league who I think are actively destructive to good, winning basketball, but Westbrook is by far the most skilled and has the longest leash. Compare someone like Elfrid Payton lol"
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
Elfrid Payton when we go on a winning streak: “And I took that personally”
I hate Elfrid Payton
Good job not addressing the on/off numbers at all because they go against your bullshit narrative that He’S KiLLinG ThE TeAM sO bAd BrO and instead diverting to ImAgInE bEinG So AnGrY BRo.  I’m tired of reading 100 posts about Elfrid Payton per day. Immanuel Quickley is an inconsistent rookie who can’t play 48 mpg. Payton would ideally be a backup but this team isn’t ideal so he’s gonna play and he’s been fine as has the team with him on the court. He’s on a 1 year/$5M deal. No shit he’s not a good starting PG. And it’s not even like you jabronis post about him after his good games. You’re dead silent after his good games as you wait for games like tonight to unload 16 separate posts about how’s 3/11 from the field and 100% responsible for the loss and eats babies and might’ve given RJ a dirty look and hurt his feelings.   Shut the fuck up.
Imaging getting this angry over the opinion that Elfrid Payton is bad lol it’s Reddit calm down   Not having a guard who can reliably shoot the 3 is killer in today’s NBA. Imagine if they had just an average PG like George Hill
Elfrid Payton?
Fucking Elfrid Payton ruining everything
If the Warriors just let Elfrid Payton shoot every time down they’d be winning.
Lonzo is gonna go the Elfrid Payton route isn't he?
"If Elfrid Payton is still in for the purpose of guarding Curry, he’s doing a bad job"
Elfrid Payton has to go. I can’t stand it. He missed 4 shots in one possession... fouls Steph on a 3... why?
Elfrid Payton
I fucking hate Elfrid Payton and honestly it’s not a bad comp rn  Lonzo is not playing good basketball at all.
"Very happy we walked away with Smart at 6, where he's surrounded by Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum and Elfrid Payton"
"Elfrid Payton for Dario Saric, a future 1st, and a future 2nd. Payton was a pretty popular prospect and the Sixers passed on him for some random European prospect that was never going to come over."
"Washington and Houston for contract reasons, I assume.  I don't even see DET giving up Killian Hayes for Lonzo, tbh. Hayes at least has a potential ceiling still, and multiple years left on a rookie deal.  Elfrid Payton is probably the next-worst, and he's just been flat-out better than Lonzo this season."
There are so many bad articles that read like:  Could the Knicks land Ja Morant?  Here's a trade idea to generate clicks! Ja Morant for Elfrid Payton and a heavily protected 2nd round pick in 2027.  Why the Knicks do it:Ja Morant is good and in a small market meaning he could be swindled into playing at MSG.   Why the Grizzlies do it:Elfrid Payton is still young-ish for Memphis to take a chance on. If he doesn't work out maybe they'll have the 52nd pick 6 years from now to fall back on.
"&gt; with elfrid payton, rj barret, kevin knox and julius randle  That's sounds like a 1st round play-off team in the East to me"
"please  thibs is winning games with elfrid payton, rj barret, kevin knox and julius randle"
is elfrid payton rocking Z02's tho?
Mixtape Elfrid Payton
Damn dude went from being compared to Magic Johnson to Elfrid Payton
So what you’re saying is that Lonzo Ball is just Elfrid Payton with a shoe deal?
Sorry bro the pelicans already had elfrid Payton before u need to offer someone else
"Nah, we got to wait and see if elfrid payton is finally going to ascend to superstardom lol  I'm surprised thibs isn't starting Taj gibson at point guard"
"Maybe the Knicks. Better PG than Elfrid Payton at least, plus they have enough defenders to cover for him. And would give them some star power for their market."
They don’t have great space and tend to really hunt their shots. It’s a really nice change of pace from the rest of the league IMO. Obvi would rather have a bit more spacing (please free me from elfrid Payton I beg you) but I appreciate how this team grinds out the clock on both sides.
"&gt; Pleasure, scarcely in one instance, is ever able to reach ecstasy and rapture; and in no one instance can it continue for any time at its highest pitch and altitude. The spirits evaporate, the nerves relax, the fabric is disordered, and the enjoyment quickly degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often, good God, how often! rises to torture and agony; and the longer it continues, it becomes still more genuine agony and torture. Patience is exhausted, courage languishes, melancholy seizes us, and nothing terminates our misery but the removal of **Elfrid Payton from the Knicks** ~~its cause~~, or starting **Immanuel Quickley** ~~another event~~, which is the sole cure of all evil, but which, from **Thibs'** ~~our~~ natural folly, **he somehow** ~~we~~ regard**s** with still greater horror and consternation. ~~Get Elfrid Payton off the Knicks.~~  Amazing Knicks blurb"
Elfrid payton was born to fill that role
Elfrid Payton please
Maybe Elfrid Payton fits this question for them
"That's Tank Commander Elfrid Payton to you!   But seriously, with Frank out we are relatively thin at the 1. I'd rather force Quickley to earn the starting spot than just give it to him. Players develop better when they're held to a higher standard. That being said, I fully expect him to be starting in a few weeks"
That and Elfrid Payton minutes.
"Closet knicks fan  Mods feel free to delete if this is against the rules. I am a die hard life long sixers fan from Canada coming in peace, and I used to hate the Knicks. But slowly I'm starting to love this team. I know by nature, as a sixers fan that shouldn't be allowed. But holy fuck is there something special going on here. I've always been a fan of Randle, and tonight solidified that. I absolutely love when players clap back. And RJ Barret? I absolutely hated that little bastard everytime the kicks played the sixers. Which is all the more reason to like him. I have to cheer for Elfrid Payton so I've learned to respect a player that's that damn good at pissing me off from another team. And Quickly? WHAT. A. HORSE. I love the NYC against the world attitude. As a sixers fan I feel that hard. I'm really digging what this team is throwing down. Love and respect from a life long 76er's fan. Y'all are becoming my number 2 in a hurry"
That’s the play by play guy that kept calling Elfrid Payton RJ?
Imagine having a PG that can shoot the 3 and still starting Elfrid Payton. When are you gonna do the right thing and start IQ Thibby boy?
elfrid payton is so trash...knick fans how do you deal with him lmao
Elfrid  Payton is cool  Edit: Payton PRITCHARD is cool god dammit I’m tired
"Yeah sorry, I still don't buy it, not that John Hollinger is gospel but here are his comments on Dwight signing with the Sixers:  ""Philadelphia lured Dwight Howard from the Lakers on a one-year minimum deal that only counts $1.6 million against their cap, even though Howard will make $2.6 million. With Howard’s BORD$ value just over $3 million, this is good business for Philly, giving them a decent option in the middle when Joel Embiid takes a load management night off. The Lakers will need to find another minimum big man to take his place.""  This means that even after having a good showing in the playoffs, his value was just slightly over the minimum, which I would guess means that he was around minimum value when he signed with the Lakers.  The difference between Rondo and Howard is that Rondo's a guard, and guard backups are just much more valuable than backup centers in today's NBA. Also, on Rondo he says:  ""Rajon Rondo’s two-year, $15 million kinda sorta shores up a position that hurt the Hawks last season, but I thought there were better options out there for Atlanta. The second year on a deal for a 34-year-old is, shall we say, suboptimal. The Hawks had several options at this price point, so lasering in on Rondo at the expense of, say, D.J. Augustin, Shabazz Napier, Elfrid Payton or Trey Burke seemed unusual. Burke, in particular, would have fit right in to the Hawks’ high pick-and-roll, rinse-and-repeat scheme and he got half as much money from Dallas.""  So it's very possible that Rondo just got overpaid."
Have fun watching kemba destroy elfrid payton Celtics fans!
So this means it’s Elfrid Payton on Kemba.   Just fucking end me.
PG - Elfrid Payton  SG - Earl Watson  SF - Emmanuel Mudiaye  PF - Ekpe Udoh  C - Eddy Curry
"Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina, Jared Harper, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullcock, Mo Harkless, Ignas Brazekdis, DSJ, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, Tah Gibson."
"Out of all the people on your roster to put a no trade clause on, Elfrid Payton?"
"Apparently first player in NBA history that got a 30pt triple double in his team debut. Most assists in history for a Nets debut. The 7th player to get a triple double in team debut alongside names you would expect like Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook and Elfrid Payton"
Making Elfrid Payton sit the fuck down.
" &gt;Thibs is such a bonehead Elfrid Payton isn't the guy you bench people for.  Fam, they are injured"
I mean your whole team is full of busts. Ntilikina and now DSJ who is in the worst situation. Just get rid of these guys if they aren't gonna play. Thibs is such a bonehead Elfrid Payton isn't the guy you bench people for.
Hopefully Elfrid Payton.

I'd still take that over Elfrid Payton.
"&gt;Knicks fans have a hive mindset and just repeat what others are saying. Ignore him. I do understand that Knicks fans at this time want to just play the rookies and have them develop and Payton deters that development.   A big part of wanting Quickley to play is that Elfrid has been playing like ass. Lol so it's a ""hive mindset"" because Knicks fans watch him stink up every game and see how his play is antithetical to winning basketball? He's the worst starting ""PG"" in the league."
"whats odd, most of nba is supporting the big business, the billionaire  I can't tell you how many people justified the ariaza one year one time payment over paid contract just to compete beause he wasn't worth it  just like marc gasol at 34 with 50 million wasn't worth it, but in this league you take swings and magic can happen. Horry Kerr, Paxon, fisher weren't worth crazy contracts either, but basketball is won by 5 and you need a cohesive unit and magic can happen  But for some reason they want to save the billionaire who over leveraged himself and in a game of Balmer and NEts building world class facilities and investing in their team, fertitta is overmatched  yyet people act like its their money when the irony is these owners will raise the price of the seats or tv so long as market allows and price you out of the game fan be damned.    For Leonard, he doesn't speak like harden so we never really know what happened  For AD, he was committed to new orleans .They just cheaped out aroudn him too and used his back to make big money while the role players who don't generate they just expended. Go read how he raved taht playing with rondo made the difference for him the best year pelicans had, the pelicans then didn't veven call rondo who also wanted to be back and replaced him with elfrid payton and low balled cousins who was injured but a monster talent.  AD got teh message, were going to market on your stardom and make your job harder. you shut up and listen and be loyal, and the fans go ahead and side with the ownership. Sadly they don't get most these playesr love the city, love the people  but the ownership and behind the scenes we just dont know."
That was painful.  At least the Elfrid Payton era is probably over.
We would've won if Elfrid Payton played 0 minutes
I hate Elfrid Payton.
"But like, I'm not saying he should go and play with Elfrid Payton or DJ Augustin.   It's just a little bit ridiculous when you are one of the best offensive players of your generation and yet you can't win at the highest level without a fellow MVP and literally the 2 best offensive players of the last 5 years.   It's also the fact that people act like KD has no weaknesses, when that's not really true, he's not a point guard, he can't run an offense in the same way a Westbrook, Curry, Harden, LeBron etc. can, although I'll admit that he's gotten way better as a passer ever since he left OKC.   All I'm saying is that KD had a chance this year to reverse the narrative around him if he had won with this current Nets team prior to the Harden trade. That's gone out the window now because once again, he's playing with the most stacked team in the league. It's his choice to do that and he has every right to do that. But he can't sit there and complain when he inevitably doesn't get the credit from the public that he thinks he deserves."
"Jrue Holiday was injured with the pelicans.  Cousins played maybe a season with them they made the playoffs but Cousins went out with a major injury.   Mirotic played a total of 60 games with the pelicans, 30 games in one season and 30 games in another.   Wood played 8 games with the pelicans.   Elfrid Payton is trash.   Holy crap you literally listed players without any context lmao wtf."
"Kyrie was a terrible exit.  Leonard just lost trust with the spurs and that was hard to comprehend  AD I also don't blame. Like harden he was commited about being there for good and watched management cut cost and blame him.  He had his most successful year finanlyl with a decently priced rondo. He raved about the expereince and said he made the difference in the playoffs. That summer rondo said he wanted to keep it rolling but pelicans didnt even call him and he took the lakers offer...they replaced him with elfrid payton They also threw away demarcus  PElicans mismanaged. I'm not sure in any high value field wall street etc where your boss can make your job harder and lead to your challenges, hurt the culture, lie adn you are expected to keep breaking your back and make him money.      In the nba the stars are underpaid. If you are a signature shoe type, you generate more income then your salary, merchandise, views so on.   These owners are far more replaceable than the players   but they are have smarter pr and somehow the narrative is also go against the employee and lets save teh billionaire a few million."
"Julius Randle, Elfrid Payton, Austin rivers and Reggie Bullock"
"His stats aren't that bad, considering he's playing with Elfrid Payton"
Yo Elfrid Payton was a triple double machine!!!! Him and Russ would be perfect together!!
elfrid payton moment
"I don't blame Austin, he's supposed to be confident in his team.  The real idiots are the people here on r/nba talkin about ""are the Knicks legit?"" when they were 5-3 with a team built around Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton."
Knicks it would have cost you 0$ to not sign Elfrid Payton. Randle is legitimately a better point guard than he is.
I know Elfrid Payton would
Watching Elfrid Payton play makes me not like basketball.  Quickley is wild for now but at least he tries to do stuff while Payton is just out there dribbling the air out of the ball.
Watching Elfrid Payton makes me sad and not like basketball.  Like what does he do?  He's pretty ball dependent but hes neither an exceptional scorer or a decent playmaker.  He just dribbles the air out the ball into the paint and just kicks it out to get it back again and redo it.
They not doing any of this against good teams. Good job beating up on Elfrid Payton and Quickley though.
Watching Elfrid Payton every other night is ruining my life.
I hate Elfrid Payton.
"Great player..great stats  **35 yrs old in 2 weeks**.   No GM with a brain is giving up big assets for that.   3Ill speak for the Knicks and we can afford the remainder of the contract and will give you elfrid payton, kevin knox and a 2nd rd pick.."
Could we interest u in Elfrid Payton?
We need to bring in a PG or a shooter/big with the DPE  Hoping for Bjelica or a PG like Elfrid Payton tbh. I think that’s all it would take.
And if Elfrid Payton shot 8 more fts and 8 more fgs he’d be averaging 26 ppg 😐
im excited but i shouldnt be. Steph turns into elfrid payton every all star game.
"I'll chime in, as someone who has for a long time wrestled with this as an Xs &amp; Os and former film guy that is also a big numbers guy. I run a consulting firm now that works with teams and agents on data &amp; scheme and that's helped shape what our public offerings on my site include and how they're presented. I hope this helps!  **Here are the stats I use when I analyze defense for a player**:  * *Contextual stats*    * \[BBall Index\] Defensive Roles, so you know who's doing which jobs really easily. Jeff Siegel (Klutch) set them up and we calculate them now that his work isn't public.    * \[BBall Index\] Matchup Difficulty, because you can have 2 guys at the same talent level but ask 1 to guard elite difficulty matchups and can hide another one and their impact data will be impacted because of it.    * \[BBall Index\] Defensive Versatility, because it's good to know how versatile defenders can be. This is particularly important for the playoffs.    * \[BBall Index\] Defensive Position (and our data on % guarding types of players by offensive archetype and position), because it's good to know what types of offensive players a defender is asked to take on. * *Interior Defense*    * \[BBall Index\] Rim deterrence for bigs to look at which anchor bigs are keeping opponents from shooting at the rim    * \[NBA .com/stats\] dFG% at the rim against vs expectations (based on 2S calcs made public on the NBA's site)    * \[BBall Index\] % of Shots Taken at the Rim Contested, which can tell us how active of a rim protector someone is    * \[BBall Index\] Adjusted Rim Points Saved / 75 possessions, to look at a per \~game view of points saved at the rim based on dFG% +/- on shots at the rim defended along with rates of defending shots at the rim    * \[BBall Index\] Block Rate on Contests (Block per rim contest) is interesting to know * *Perimeter Defense*    * \[BBall Index\] Passing Lane Defense to evaluate interception + deflection rates    * \[BBall Index\] Pickpocket Rating to look at on-ball steals    * \[BBall Index\] Loose Ball Recovery Rate to look at win rates on hustle situations    * \[NBAShotCharts\] Real Adjusted TOV rate, to look at RAPM style calcs to see how players are impacting the team's efforts generating turnovers * *Defensive Rebounding*    * Adj. Box Out Rate, so we see how often players are boxing out on opposing team shots while on the court defensively.    * \[BBall Index\] Adj. DReb Success Rate, so we see the win rate for players in rebounding battles on defense    * \[BBall Index\] DReb Success Rate +/-, which tells us how far above or below expectations that DReb Success Rate is, based on factors like their positioning on the court, teammate box out tendencies, how often those rebounds are contested, and the player's physical tools.    * \[NBAShotCharts\] Real Adjusted DReb rate, to look at RAPM style calcs to see how players are impacting the team's effectiveness winning the DReb battle * *Impact Stats*    * \[BBall Index\] D-LEBRON (LEBRON stands for Luck-adjusted player Estimate using a Box prior Regularized ON-off), which you can read about [here](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-introduction/). It uses RAPM calcs for on/off data instead of an estimate, uses the best weighting of box score stats public work had to offer to be a prior for the RAPM calcs, we stabilize small samples and use a role adjustment to do so to increase in-season accuracy, luck-adjust FT and 3PT shooting with stabilized multi-year player and location specific shooting data to increase accuracy (which is seen in the testing difference between RAPM and Luck-Adjusted RAPM), and will soon have an extra garbage time adjustment added in as well.    * \[538\] D-RAPTOR, though for small sample guys it doesn't appear to have the same sorts of padding built in and can show some wild results. They use RAPM type calcs along with a tracking stats based box component.  All of those stats (even the ones we don't calculate) are available at BBall Index and are contextualized with percentiles and letter grades (so you don't need to remember what's good or bad for all 280+ stats we have on those), so any eval of a player (offense or defense) can be done all in one place with all the info you need on a player's role/deployment, context, style, and effectiveness.  Context also matters a lot for impact stats. Just like if you take Ish Smith and make him a C in 2K his overall will go down, in real life if you optimize guys better or worse it'll play a role on their impact data. So for defense, defensive role (I eval how it matches to their skill set), Matchup Difficulty (compared to their talent level and where they probably should be), and defensive versatility (are they being over/underutilized).  A few examples where context impacted results:  * AD's defensive versatility this season is in the 300s. And no, it's not because he's been out for some games. We're not seeing him fully unleashed this regular season, and his defensive impact is lower than it's potential because of that. * Elfrid Payton is in the 99th percentile this season for Matchup Difficulty, which is waaay over where it should be to put him in any position to succeed. He's been an average defender in prior years that has taken a massive nosedive this year in D-LEBRON. This is a big part of why we see that. And there will be situations where a team needs to slot someone poorly due to roster construction/skills, but this is still context that matters. * Glenn Robinson III has a skill set best aligned to the Chaser role defensively, where you're an off-ball Guard/Wing defender that plays rotational defense and chases shooters around screens but isn't guarding at the point of attack a ton. The 76ers were poorly constructed last season and had him as an on-ball Wing Stopper, making his defensive impact drop and him underperform where he could be if better optimized.  I'm also more of an Xs &amp; Os guy than a data guy by trade, so I can also share a few areas on film I'm also paying attention to when trying to evaluate a player's defense.  * I let the data evaluate what it can and tell me what's happening in those areas. I'll dig into the why from a technique, skills, and tools standpoint. * I pay attention to off-ball defense to evaluate player positioning relative to where they should be based on the location of the ball and players, whatever actions are being run, and what that player's responsibilities are given their location on the court. Are they the would-be tag man, the guy that'd rotate down to help the tag man as he tags, the guy taking the pop if it happens, etc. * I watch for closeout, P&amp;R ball handler, P&amp;R screener's man, and off-screen defensive technique. It'd be a lot to type out here, but those are areas where on enough film and knowing the right teaching points you can see why a player's technique is good/bad. * If 2 guys are closing out to the same offensive player, someone's wrong. If the same guy is involved in a ton of those, they're probably messing up. THT this year is an example.  But in reality, watching games live you miss soooo much of this. I re-watch every Lakers game and notice 5x more than I do watching live, and I'm someone that's trained and paid for that type of analysis. The eye test watching live is a tricky thing to rely on. So using contextualized data along with film, and **film** not entertainment watching live, is the best approach if you want to be holistic.  I hope this was useful. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions (you can find me on Twitter @ Tim\_NBA if you want to ask there)."
"He was defiantly a project when he was drafted although the Knicks didn’t seem too interested in developing him(he’s been in trade talks basically since his second year). It’s not like he didn’t get opportunities though, he played 21 mpg over 178 games(51 starts) over his first three seasons. Over those years he only had 6 ppg, 3 apg, and 2 reb. However he consistently proved to be the best perimeter defender on the team. His finishing has always been an issue but most Knicks fans agree he will be a good role player if he can start connecting on 3’s at a higher clip. The problem is that he’s not a good shot creator and only a decent playmaker which is why he plays off ball mostly now. This year he’s been great from 3 point range though but on only 18 attempts(56%). At the beginning of this season he was at the end of the Knicks rotation, only playing more than 5 minutes in two of the first four games before an injury. The injury held him out for about a month and when he came back Thibs didn’t play him at all until last Thursday against the Kings, when he played 23 min because on Elfrid Payton’s injury. He then played 11 and 13 min in the next 2 games before starting last nights game because of Elf’s injury and DRose being for health and safety. For most of the season he’s been behind Payton, Rose, IQ, Rivers, Bullock, Burks, and RJ in the rotation but he’s risen of Rivers recently and hopefully he’ll get more runtime even when Rose and Elf come back because of his good play recently. The issue is that Thibs likes short rotations and refuses to play more than 10 guys in any non blowout game."
"Elfrid Payton is a great on-ball defender man, assuming you're talking about him"
"&gt;Simmons, Elfrid Payton, Giannis  One of these is not like the others"
"Actually the guys you mentioned all have relatively lower Defensive FGA per game. Look at all players w over 10 defensive FGA per game - right after Lavine you see Simmons, Elfrid Payton, Giannis. DFG% has historically been used to measure on-ball defense. Again, this has to be taken in context w the eye test, and Bulls fans can tell you firsthand that watching hin defensively this month has been very entertaining - he has been great"
"The Elfrid Payton line aged like fine wine. It was so funny when the Knicks picked him up and everyone in the comments were like ""We've finally acquired the next Bradley Beal!!! Ahahahahhahaha (kill me)"""
"I was watching that episode today for nostalgia reasons   Better find a church   A good place to cry   We will not tank or play Frank Nitlikina because Mudiay is our guy   Better find a scept   A good place to pray for all of your sins   Will I overpay Trey Burke or let him walk away (like Jeremy Lin that jerk)   And Oakley is still not welcome back, maybe I’ll resign jarret Jack hell I ll pay the luxury tax to pay Tyreeke Evans the Max, Five year contract ooh  Maybe i should bring Isiah Thomas back! And the small one too for a longer deal!  I think Elfrid Payton is the next Bradley Beal !"
"The effectiveness of Elfrid Payton depends entirely on how comfortable he can be with his teammates and the ball. Let him move around as he sees fit, and you can get an Elfrid Payton capable of running off 5 straight triple-doubles. Make him uncomfortable and he looks like a bust."
"Knicks somehow steal the East. Take the Lakers all the way before they hit massive foul trouble in game 7 of the finals. With seconds left Randle reverts to type and runs into a LeBron / AD double team. He somehow manages to kick it out, Elfrid Payton is open for the game winning 3. It's an air ball. In the soulsearching aftermath, James Dolan offers the entire team, every future draft pick and the Rangers for the wrong Antetokoumpo brother. Fin."
Oh no what will the Knicks ever do without Elfrid Payton?!
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"FWIW, here's my personal ranking of these guys, taking contract into account:   1. Lonzo 2. McLaughlin 3. Hill 4. Wright 5. Rubio   Also the Knicks need to get on the phone and try and get George Hill. One of Ntilikina/Knox + Elfrid Payton + Pistons 2021 second should theoretically get it done. Gives them much-needed three point shooting and a guy to provide that veteran presence they wanted CP3 for."
Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton fell while driving yet was given a foul.
Not Elfrid Payton.   I watch enough Knicks games to know that he’s useless if he can’t make his layups.  Hopefully they can get another shooter at the point guard position next to RJ because RJ and Julius can handle the playmaking duties.  Honestly don’t know why they don’t just start Austin Rivers when he gets back.
Don't forget Elfrid Payton

You can thanks them by trading kat for elfrid payton just saying
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
or Elfrid Payton lol
“Budget Elfrid Payton” I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy
"Yes, Julius Randle is doing well, but this isn’t even a sample size problem - it’s completely cherry-picked and relies on the fact that Randle plays a shitload of minutes on a .500 team in the East.  AD has been injured and is the 2nd guy on an actual championship team in the West while Randle is sharing the ball on a .500 team in the East with RJ Barrett and Elfrid Payton.   Per 36: AD 24.7 Randle 22.6  Joel Embiid is playing 32 mpg.   Per 36: Embiid 12 Randle 10.8  Lillard attempts 2.4x more 3’s a game on a team where he basically goes down in a hail of gunfire every night.  Is it more valuable when someone plays more minutes?   Absolutely.  Will AD and Embiid play Randle’s minutes in the playoffs?  Yes."
"Yes the Knicks and 73 win Warriors circumstances are soo similar. Its not like Steph or Klay are as good as Elfrid Payton and RJ Barrett, Randles getting open shots while Draymond getting guarded like he’s the best player on the team."
43 right behind Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton maybe?
Elfrid Payton started sending his energy
"Are we going to act like a guy playing with Elfrid Payton, Rj Barrett  and Reggie Bullock is playing with stars? Not  sure Randle’s healthy is that much better than bam’s injured if it even is. Dude  is surrounded by inefficient non shooters. There are like 2 guys on the team besides him capable of hitting a 3 consistently."
"Trae  When he can play some D and not get roasted by Elfrid fuckin Payton of all people, then we can reconsider."
I take it back I’m now becoming a vocal elfrid payton stan
Elfrid Payton lmao
"Nah you can have an opinion If you’re bad, you can’t be mad if you’re Elfrid Payton bad though."
"Elfrid Payton looks like he's going to absolutely deck Trae before the night is over.  r/NYKnicks would, at least for a night, be the Elfrid Payton fucking fan club"
Elfrid Payton not good enough to be mad at a foul call like that
Nah fuck it im investing in elfrid payton stonk
anyone want a mildly used Elfrid Payton?
Oh boy do I have an Elfrid Payton for you guys!
The #1 thing I hate the most about watching Knicks games is their black “York Knicks City Never Sleeps New” jerseys. And I also have to watch Elfrid Payton play keep away from anyone under the age 25. Just give us the fucking 96-97 black strip jerseys we’ve been asking for
"Melo can shoot tho, so he can adjust to just a role player role.  Not sure a 6'3 guard who can't shoot is a useful role player, I guess he could be Elfrid Payton, not sure Elfrid Payton is really useful"
"elfrid payton will be much, MUCH worse when fans are back"
How would you like one Elfrid Payton?
&gt;Elfrid Payton PG - (HS Ranking): N/A  BIG SURPRISE THERE.
"That was our (admittedly foolish) hope, but Elfrid Payton is apparently inevitable."
"They should have been drafting around the top 5 for the last 3-4 years. Cleared up cap space and went after decent free agents while guys like Porzingis were on rookie deals.      I don't get why they went out and signed THJ or used the cap space from the Porzingis trade to get Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, and Marcus Morris. That's 4 older, mediocre, low ceiling PFs, when their 2 best young players at the time were Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson."
Lmaooo I said that Barrett is better at everything but scoring. Seeing that scoring is the most important skill in basketball Lavine is a better player rn. He’s also 5 yrs older than RJ. My point was that if RJ continues to improve his scoring ability every year then when he’s 25 he can be a more valuable player than Zach because he does everything well. RJ could also end up not improving to that point but I believe he can. His biggest flaw rn is shooting. The fact that he bumped his ft up 15% higher shows how hard he works and that he’s developing shooting touch. You have been parading around hating on a 20 yr old kid and telling other people they are immature and just being straight up a dick. Obviously RJ has flaws at his craft. We all do and if I had thousands of people hating on me for not being great at my job I wouldn’t be able to handle it tbh. The Knicks are my favorite team and always will be but sometimes we forget the human aspects of the game. I’ve done it too (looking at my Elfrid Payton comments lol ). You can be critical but you have to give them props when it’s due. Hope you have a good day Vyper.

But who's guarding Elfrid Payton? 🤔
Elfrid Payton. Supposedly a good defender but he dies on every screen
Elfrid Payton would have taken a layup and missed
Only person who likes elfrid Payton is knicksfan6 (basically himself) on Twitter lmao
"Knicks fans, nobody wants Elfrid Payton"
"Knicks play at a snail's pace for today's game. Still a phenomenal defense, but our young athletic team is gimped by guards that can only operate the half-court set and are too slow to run the floor.   There are many times where Obi Toppin races ahead in the fast break only to have to sacrifice a dunk/lob opportunity because the guards walk the ball up the court. Really frustrating to watch how we've been pigeonholed into Grit n' Grind by Elfrid Payton.  Hopefully over the season DRose will bring up the pace, and we all know how electric IQ is going to be."
Elfrid Payton &gt; Clippers  Lou Will &gt; Sixers  Sixers 2nd round pick &gt; Knicks
"First off, Wilson Chandler wasn’t on the Nets when they made their 2019 playoff run. He signed the next season. And DeMarre Carroll was acquired by trade, not FA signing. But I’m sure that Carroll’s playing 25 minutes a night and putting up 11 and 5 was the key to the Nets making the playoffs. Good to see you doing your own research.  You’re the type of Knicks fan that will eagerly lap up whatever bullshit song-and-dance that MSG will feed you and beg for seconds. You think Wally is cool because he has nice suits and “tells it like it is.” Keep dreaming.  You don’t have the independent thought capability to consider why Quickley has to “earn” all his minutes but Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock get a clean slate every night. You puff out your chest like you’re a Real Fan Who Watches All the Games but if you paid attention to the latest MSG postgame show, you’d have heard Alan Hahn say that the Knicks were only mathematically 6th for a few hours because there were still two evening games left to play in the East. And you have the temerity to tell me this team is a real 6 seed.  Derrick Rose is averaging 4.2 assists a game and has a 2:1 AST:TO. His facilitation won’t add much. And he’s a career 30.5% free throw shooter so he won’t help the spacing that makes the offense 30th in the league. But maybe if you actually rubbed together a brain cell or two and looked up basketball reference once in a while you’d know that.  Now give me my medal, kid."
Lord Elfrid Payton. He's an exceptional defender both man to man and rotating and closing out and even grabbing boards. It's really a shame he's probably one of the worst offensive players in the league.
"i don't know enough about elfrid payton to know if this is serious or sarcasm, but his stats look good and we could use a passing point guard regardless of his ability to shoot"
Elfrid payton is already the starting point guard for the Knicks. They are trying to get rid of him.
Elfrid Payton for a 2023 2nd round pick?  please?
"I mean, he already put IQ on 15 minutes limit in favor of Elfrid Payton. Like, WTF? He was scorching hot and you doing him like that?"
All my homies fucking hate elfrid Payton
"I don't think it's a confidence thing, the Bucks on the court are clearly contenders, Bucks fans just know that a step on getting their championship is gonna be firing Bud. JUst like I'm sure Wizards fans know that before anything good happens for the Wizards, Brooks has to be fired. Or how Knicks fans know that we're not going to win a championship with Elfrid Payton as our starting PG. Just a step along the way"
Elfrid Payton
Elfrid fucking Payton
"Rivers hasn’t played for them in a while, he’s not there anymore  You forgot elfrid payton"
"38% from three and 45% from the field for a 20 year old 2nd option on a playoff team that doesn’t have much spacing with Elfrid Payton and Mitchell Robinson being 40% of the starting lineup is actually rather efficient and in fact, he has a higher FG% and 3pt% than Ja Morant, Coby White, and Tyler Herro while playing much better defense than they are as well. Given his situation offensively being lesser than stellar I would actually say he’s been pretty efficient."
"Randle playing hero ball, RJ getting ignored despite being hot, the existence of Elfrid Payton."
Elfrid Payton starts for the Knicks tbf
I really liked both Wiggins and Parker. In particular I thought Wiggins would be an excellent two way wing shot creator.  I would have bets lots of money that he'd be a multi-time All-Star.  I also remember really liking Elfrid Payton and I was excited the Grizzlies got Jordan Adams at #22 (lol).
Frank Ntilikina and Elfrid Payton
2014 Elfrid Payton
I still can't believe Elfrid Payton isn't his kid.
Spend 5 seconds on the Knicks sub and you’ll find out    It’s Elfrid... it’s Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton. Literally shrinks the floor because he cant shoot and doesnt pass RJ the ball
He’d be better than elfrid payton a few nights ago
Elfrid Payton was on the floor. Bullock was on the floor. Payton was on the floor. Quickley (love him but he's a rookie) was on the floor. **Payton was on the floor**. RJ was 8/16 and 3/4 from 3 for 23 points at that point. You sure that's not the 2nd worst guy on the Knicks to take that shot if you're the Timberwolves? Btw Elfrid Payton was on the court too.
Fuck it why not. If it means I never have to watch Elfrid Payton on the Knicks ever again I'm 100% for it
thank you! he said they didn't want anyone else taking the shot as if Elfrid fucking Payton wasn't in the game
I'm so sick of the Elfrid Payton experience
&gt; Rob Hennigan was hellbent on Elfrid Payton  :'(
That “drive left and cross court pass to the corner for a wide open three only for it to be Elfrid Payton” has to happen at least twice a game
yeah it's obviously a big difference.. one of the biggest of all-time? no lol. an all-star to an mvp caliber player isnt one of the biggest differences of all-time. plenty of players go from   just this season harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. that's a way bigger difference.  or anthony davis going from playing with elfrid payton as a primary playmaker to lebron james  or lebron going from anthony parker at sg to prime dwade.  and im probably missing a bunch of bigger ones. vucevic to jokic isnt on the same tier lol
"you're getting downvoted but you're right..Orlando never had a proper guard or floor general during the years Aaron Gordon was there. He was working with literally only developing PGs, Elfrid Payton and Fultz for a majority of his time with one year of DJ Augustin leading in assists (but he isn't really an elite floor general)"
Rob Hennigan was hellbent on Elfrid Payton and Vooch as corner stones at the point guard and center position. Victor and Elfrid couldn't coexist due to spacing issues and they had Evan Fournier who did provide that floor spacing. Serge looked like a guy that could balance Vooch's lack of defense. And last was Alex Martins breathing down Rob Hennigan's neck to make the playoffs.
So guys who have more help on teams that are underachieving deserve it over the guy who has elfrid Payton and bullock starting next to him on an overachieving team ?

"1. Randle's development 2. So young and fun 3. Elfrid Payton 4. A playoff spot and maybe a win or two in a first round series 5. Quickley: Very good, Toppin: Bad"
Yet Elfrid Payton somehow still has a job
"Makes the Knicks deciding to ""roll over"" cap space after missing out on KD and Kyrie one of the smarter offseason moves in a long while. Even if they did end up signing 4 PFs and Elfrid Payton to kick the can to the next off-season."
Too soon for Elfrid Payton to go to China

"Lol that Tweet was a bad look but this always gets blown out of proportion -- Magic traded their leading APG player (Elfrid Payton) at the deadline, and he was putting up 6.3 apg.

"Yeah if you add the Detroit 2nd it makes more sense, it wasn’t there before. Disagree with Elfrid being better than Pat though. Pat’s a good catch and shoot guy at this point, 40%+ shooter from 3 this season. Good defense too. Elfrid’s a slightly better playmaker who can give you more points than Pat, but he’s going to do that inefficiently. Sub-50 TS% is god awful in this day and age if we are being honest, and Elfrid’s sub-50 TS% for his entire career, not just this season.   Maybe they’d take it if all else fails, but I think they’ll rather go for someone like George Hill for example. Hill gives you everything that Payton does + much better shooting."
"Why would the Clippers give up a 1st for Elfrid Payton though, doesn’t sound like a good move for them. They don’t have many picks to begin with and Payton hasn’t been good even for a borderline playoff team. Payton’s inefficient and not a good playmaker either, they’d basically give up a 1st for a worse Pat Beverly."
Elfrid Payton
"Elfrid Payton is a really good point guard who's been cursed by landing in these awful situations. His tenure in NOLA is a perfect example. He was fantastic with AD and, before Elf's injury, we looked amazing. Then he goes down and the dominos begin to fall. When he gets back from injury, the season is already over for us thanks to AD's trade saga."
I'm still floored by that Elfrid/RJ assist stat. Mathematically it boils down to just about 1 assist from Elfrid to RJ per game.  If that's not the ultimate indictment of how poorly poopy Payton meshes with the Knicks offense then I don't know what is.
This is a stat that I’d expect Elfrid Payton to be strangely high in and I’m disappointed he’s not
So what you are saying is Elfrid Payton should continue starting for the Knicks?
Guard/Perimeter defense?????? Get Elfrid Payton.
"OKC has a vested interest in making sure the Clippers stay mediocre so I can't see them trading Hill to them. Also what assets do they have to trade for Hill? Lou Williams makes sense salary-match wise but he straight up said he'd retire if he got moved.  I think the Clippers need a playmaker but they have to lower their expectations. I don't even think they can get Ricky Rubio now. As much as I hate to say, two potentially obtainable playmaking upgrades are *gag* Elfrid Payton and Eric Bledsoe."
All my homies hate Elfrid Payton.
They need Elfrid Payton
It's Elfrid Payton with a 6-11 record.
The lowest win% is Elfrid Payton who's record is 6-11 when he gets a triple double. (Minimum of 10).  2nd lowest is Gary Payton who is 7-8.
Elfrid Payton is the Orlando Magic all-time triple double leader.
"Elfrid Payton apparently, no matter how hard I pray"
"There’s this ballistic stat that says of RJ’s 1200 minutes so far, Elfrid Payton, our starting PG, has played about 850 minutes w him. He’s assisted him 17 times. RJ doesn’t have the most welcoming situation either lol. Not saying this is indicative of RJ becoming a better player since it’s all what if’s, but let’s not act like Tatum was the only one in a less-than-forgiving place."
I’ll take a retired Lou for Elfrid Payton
"This comment is a joke right? Trading Elfrid Payton for Lonzo? Who do you think is running the Pelicans, the typical /r/NBA poster who still thinks Lonzo sucks?"
"I don't think getting rid of Wanamaker is enough incentive to have to take on Elfrid Payton for the Warriors, and even less why they would throw in Paschall. Maybe they'd be interested in Austin Rivers though but I think they're fairly high on Paschall."
"- Warriors get: Elfrid Payton  - Knicks get: Brad Wanamaker, Eric Paschall + 2nd round pick  ....... next trade  - Bulls get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Reggie Bullock, Frank Ntilikina + 2 1st round picks  - Knicks get: Zach Lavine, Tomas Satoransky"
"  RJ has played 842 minutes while sharing the floor with Elfrid Payton.   Elfrid has assisted RJ 18 times in that time.   The 2-man lineup of Payton and Barrett has a -1.4 net rating. Payton and Randle has -3.3. IQ and RJ is at +5.9. IQ and Randle is at +11.5. Payton/RJ/Randle is at -2.9. IQ/RJ/Randle is a +13.8. Not only are Elfrid's individual stats abysmal, he makes the best players on the team worse. He straight up stinks. But sure, he's asked to score and is giving us a whopping 12.6 ppg on 48.6% TS so we should cut him some slack, you're right"
"Jrue Holiday from Philly to New Orleans has a crazy web too. That was in 2013.  Philly got Nerlens Noel and and a future 1st from New Orleans.   The future 1st was used on Elfrid Payton who was instantly traded to Orlando for Dario Saric, a future 1st, and a future 2nd (lol).   THAT future 1st was used on Shamet, who was traded for Harris.  Dario was traded for Butler, who was traded for Richardson, who was traded for Curry.   The future 2nd in that deal was traded to the Knicks for two future 2nds. One of those 2nds was traded to Dallas in the Curry deal, we still have the other one.   And of course Jrue was traded to Milwaukee for the boatload of picks, so the web will continue on for years."
RJ has the same type of athleticism and build as butler. I think he has a slightly higher ceiling just being ahead of where jimmy was at the same point. I completely disagree on his passing. He’s a. Restive willing passer who just has to play next to elfrid Payton.
That was a really nice way of saying Elfrid Payton sucks lmao
Haven’t been able to sleep since I saw that Elfrid Payton to RJ Barrett assist stat...   Seems like a nice guy but I can’t wait to stop watching him.
Because of Elfrid Payton
Fuck Elfrid Payton
"He is more of a scorer, but it's not hard to be a better playmaker than Elfrid Payton, who can only get assists through lobs."
"Immanuel Quickley. More importantly, Not Elfrid Payton"
Friendly reminder that Elfrid Payton has played with RJ for 1000+ minutes this year and given him 18 assists. That's 1 assist every 46 minutes
RJ 30+ point games with Elfrid Payton in the lineup: 0  RJ 30+ point games without Elfrid Payton in the lineup: 1  checkmate.
The Knicks are now 4-1 when Elfrid Payton doesn't play.
His second options are like RJ Barrett and Elfrid Payton lmao what do u expect? This is a team that is better than the sum of its parts due to its defense so Randle will get his no matter what
Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton
"Ideal trade deadline is we ship off Elfrid Payton, Frank, and Reggie Bullock for picks/players and trade for Lonzo. No Oladipo plz"
Can we interest u in secondary playmaker Elfrid Payton???
Racking up blocks on Elfrid Payton and Ish Smith
Bad comparison.  Frank can shoot but can’t pass.  Simmons is like Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton would like a word
And yet Elfrid Payton was healthy and only played 13 minutes.
"Elfrid Payton last season averaged 10 pts, 5 rebs, 7 assists."
"Not playing actively makes your team lose. Being available helps the team. Even at his worst Edwards wasn't a net negative on the floor, he'd still be miles better than some replacement level guy like Elfrid Payton lmao"
"my girl didnt appreciate my elfrid payton slander throughout the year, reddit really saved me"
"Swaggy P went from the San Fernando Valley to USC to playing for both the Lakers and the Clippers.  Josh Smith was born in Atlanta and was drafted and by Atlanta spent most of his career on the Hawks.  Elfrid Payton is from Louisiana, went to UL Lafayette and played for the Pelicans"
"The only argument left for Frank that I accept is that we played Elfrid Payton the worst starting point guard in the league so damn much, that why wouldn’t we just give his minutes to Frank who can at least shoot 3’s and play defense."
Elfrid Payton
"But players improve. Career assists per game would make Elfrid Payton the 12th best passer in the league, ahead of Jokic, Kyrie, and Conley. Rondo and Rubio would be better than all of them plus Lebron and Harden.  Booker plays with CP3 as the main facilitator but  Tatum plays with three guys in the starting lineup with over three assists and Booker just has CP3. Normally you’d assume Booker would have less turnovers because he’s not the main ball handler. But he didn’t - not in the Lakers series but also not in the regular season or against the Nuggets.  Nuggets are far from the best defense but Booker averaged 4.5 assists and 3.5 turnovers against them. Compare to the main Blazers: Dame averaged 10.2 assists and 2.2 turnovers while CJ averaged 4.3 assists and 2 turnovers. Meanwhile vs the nets, Giannis is averaging 3.3 assists and 4.5 turnovers while Middleton has 3.5 assists and 3.25 turnovers though Jrue has good numbers."
Elfrid Payton does not like this post
"I think he should get that pretty easily  heck I hope my team throws 30m/3yr at him, he'd be better than elfrid payton"
"Okay and Randle's a better shooter and playmaker, Zion's just a much better finisher  Consider than Zion had Ingram and Lonzo while Randle had RJ and Elfrid Payton"
pg13 for elfrid payton?
Elfrid payton honorary starter
Elfrid Payton 5 straight triple-doubles
We Knicks love Elfrid Payton....
But he's Elfrid Payton
The alternative is Elfrid Payton.
bruh jae crowder was scared of elfrid payton
"Thibs: ""Hmm, offense..?""  *Starts Elfrid Payton.*"
"Try to get better.   Literally, I’m on the train of swap PatBev for Eric Bledsoe and sign Elfrid Payton for a vet min. Im Open to all other discussion but it’s not like they have a lot of room here"
Elfrid Payton on the magic. Caruso right now
well I have a friend who's a New York Knicks fan and I send him some variation of this all the time so uhhh:  Elfrid Payton career APG: 6.4 APG  Michael Jordan 5.3 APG  D Rose: 5.5 APG  Allen Iverson 6.2 APG  Larry Bird: 6.3 APG
How many times have you typed Elfrid Payton?
"After that we had Elfrid Payton, Isiah Canaan, Mike James, Elie Okobo, Tyler Ulis...  But the answer to the question is yes"
You forgot Elfrid Payton
"Why the fuck didn't the Knicks push for KD/Kyrie? Why? The had the cap space and they used it on Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Elfrid Payton, and Taj Gibson. I still don't get it."
24/10/6 on 46/41/81 with Elfrid Payton as your starting point guard  Played every single game this year  He deserves 2nd team
Man who played Elfrid Payton 26 mpg wins coach of the year
some dude who started elfrid payton for most of the year won lol
No Elfrid Payton wtf
Ben is a glorified Elfrid Payton
"Yep. As an unbiased honest Blazers fan, I think we need to trade Dame to a contender, probably the New York Knicks for quality assets. I'm thinking of starting PG vet leader Elfrid Payton, young prospects Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox, and maybe a second round pick."
"&gt; As for the Knicks, the goal was to create cap space to sign KD and Kyrie, but they got neither and used that cap space on Marcus Morris, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, Julius Randle, and Taj Gibson.  The return on this was just outstanding. Flipped Marcus Morris for Quickley + DSJ for D Rose, Regular-Season Randle, etc.."
There are a lot of point guards more disappointing than Pat Bev. Eric Bledsoe has to be above him at least. Elfrid Payton?
for 3 games 2 of our starters were elfrid payton and nerlens noel. lol. lots of room for improvement. im feeling better than i did a week ago.
He'd be a very big upgrade from Elfrid Payton. Just make sure yall take care of horny nunn
Better than Elfrid Payton
Why am I now imagining Elfrid Payton in a Lakers jersey?
Elfrid Payton will fix their defence just trust me bro
"Ah yes, the Elfrid Payton of the LA Lakers."
If Brunson was the Knicks starting point guard this year instead of Elfrid Payton... idk I just would’ve liked that
"Can’t believe you left Elfrid Payton, the king of “intangibles”, off this list."
"none of those are good options, rather roll the dice on a young cheap guy who might turn into a serviceable starter  or ya know, we got one elfrid payton for sale"
I hear you can get elfrid payton at a fraction of that cost 👀
i will trade you elfrid payton for that
Can I offer you a Elfrid Payton in this trying time lol
"Lateral for Dame yeah, but that would be a massive step up for the Knicks. Our PG rotation this year was Rose, Elfrid Payton and Frank...."
Elmer Fudd and Elfrid Payton have the same initials
I always got Cam Payne and Elfrid Payton confused. Never again.
I don't understand how he only got a serious offer from the Knicks after looking decent for the Rockets during the Harden years and then only to not get minutes over Elfrid Payton and eventually out of the lineup.
You could argue the opposite as well. Plenty of players show up big early on but as time goes on people realize they aren't all they were hyped up to be. Look at Jabrari Parker and Elfrid Payton on that list.  Same thing will happen with the 2018 list.
trade him to the knicks for elfrid payton
The Knicks started Elfrid Payton at point guard this year
Not so much this season but last season I remember watching the rockets series and it seemed like Gallo could not miss. Then he was taking some of the same shots he took against the rockets when he played the Knicks last night but he couldn’t make any of them. Was so weird for me to go from seeing Gallo as Steph Curry 2.0 to elfrid Payton
"Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.  We’re mediocre it’s “lolknicks!!!!!!” We’re good and starting to turn it around it’s “you’ve been so bad before this, lolknicks” we’re excited about the playoffs “lolknicks”. Just admit that you’re mad that the Knicks get more media attention than your team gets. Knicks were overachieving this year obviously. Any team starting elfrid Payton in the playoffs is not going far.   If you’re a salty ass nets fan, just say that, it’s easier."
But you got Elfrid Payton though? That's worth like 5 Trays.
"Hahaha, hes talking like he's Elfrid Payton.  You're not going anywhere Rose."
"So motherfucking proud to be a Knicks fan. Proud of every single fucking player on this team including Elfrid motherfucking Payton. Never dreamed we would be a 4 seed in the playoffs getting 3 fucking games at MSG WITH THE BEST FUCKING FANS ON THE PLANET. Would have loved to see this series with Big Meech but even so happy with how the young guns have stepped up, IQ, OBI and RJ Motherfucking Barrett (20 years old btw)  Time for a motherfucking chopped cheese    True basketball fans know that the game is better when the Knicks are good and sorry but NYC will always be Knickstape...  YERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
Knicks fans can’t blame elfrid Payton
Man screw elfrid Payton he sold the series
"Knicks fans, Elfrid Payton was the problem right?"
Was Elfrid Payton that bad in game one? Why didn’t Rose keep coming off the bench?
Thibs should give bench minutes to Elfrid Payton at this point
Took the title from Elfrid Payton
"Elfrid Payton is the next westbrook, it's so obvious"
"Bum, Elfrid Payton better"
"It's not about the game at hand it's about your responsibilities as a leader when playing a team sport  I would care about this if any player did it (including Randle or RJ or anyone on the Knicks, I'd care even more if one of them did it. Elfrid Payton had awful body language in his first game not starting and the whole Knicks sub got mad at him for it) it just happens that LeBron is the only player that's done something like this recently"
"""it's not even close"" is such a weird phrase for people to use on topics where it's clearly close enough to bring up or debate. The only way something isn't even close is if you're comparing like Elfrid Payton to Steph Curry or some shit"
"Why are you upset, your Plan A at starting PG was Elfrid Payton in the playoffs. Schroeder is solid and that's not a massive overpay"
Elfrid Payton 🤡
Elfrid Payton ALWAYS has zero points
CJ for Elfrid Payton straight up. Limited time offer.
I watched elfrid payton start 72 games. I still have nightmares of him spotting up for 3
elfrid payton
"The 36 thing is fair, but in my eyes our biggest need is a starting point guard and if you can go from Elfrid Payton to a first ballot hall of famer then it’s pretty tough not to. And every team in NBA history has had dirty players. Not ideal but it’s part of the game. CP3 is much more benign than a Grayson Allen and company"
I can tell you right now the Knicks would be much better off with Westbrook instead of Elfrid Payton this year lok
no he's a bust they should trade him to new york for elfrid payton
"Given the cost differential and how cheap Elfrid Payton is, you might be able to talk me into that deal. 2.2 M for Elfrid Payton vs. 22 M for Lonzo?         Payton’s strength is defense and the Pelicans need defense more than they need offense. The only thing that gives pause is the potential for better exchanges."
Bimbo Coles  BJ Armstrong   Ricky Rubio  Elfrid Payton  Rusty LaRue
May i interest you in Elfrid Payton for Lonzo?
Championship if they use Jerebko as Elfrid Payton and Mitch as Rose
"Who's better, Ja or Elfrid Payton with LeBrons body and mind?"
"Be prepared for Marv Albert to call RJ Barrett ""Elfrid Payton"" because 6 and 9 looks similar to him"
Sub in Richmond after the 4th minute and they’ll be fine. He’s the Elfrid Payton of this lineup lol
"It’s funny that a player who many had/have considered to have future star talent would say he modeled his game after Devin Booker, Steph Curry, it’s like yeah okay makes sense...then Elfrid Payton. Just funny considering how bad Elfrid is now and that a future star player was studying him for reference, and said player had a down year"
Man was looking like Elfrid Payton out there all right
&gt;Elfrid Payton  Setting humble goals I see
That makes sense. He did a great Elfrid Payton impression in the playoffs.
Maybe he watched a little too much Elfrid Payton
Made Elfrid Payton proud
Elfrid Payton!? No wonder he's been ass
Probably wasn’t a Knicks fan that threw it considering they won and it was a home game....unless they were aiming at Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton
But you’re forgetting that the Knicks have Elfrid Payton
I think he’ll end up being a GREAT 2nd option on a contending team. Dude is only 20 and he averaged 17 points on good efficiency with Elfrid Payton as his starting Pg. Also playing under Thibs who is a great defensive coach will continue to make RJ an even better defender than what he is now. By the time he’s 23-24 I see him being an all star with a chance at making the all nba team.
"Something that gets overlooked with guys like Luka and Russ, guards that are able to rebound and push the ball/control the offense consistently is that their skills in other areas of the game and on the court are what enable the team to be able to have a game plan as such. You don't think the Knicks would want to see Elfrid Payton grab a rebound and initiate a fast break 5-6 times a game? Lmao"
they need Elfrid Payton
"If your last sentence is honestly what you think, that tells me you barely watch the Wolves. Dude has become a very good creator in general and is a very willing (and surprisingly good) passer when the D focuses their attention him.   Also, if 3 assists per game was that easy, everyone would do it. Ant at 3 assists per game is 72nd in the league, barely behind Elfrid Payton - an actual starting PG. If we look at his last two months where his role has greatly increased, he is averaging 4 assists per game which would put him at top 50 in the league."
"Yeah, D-Rose as 6MOTY candidate is definitely flying under the radar in the media... I can't see the Knicks having this much success without trading for him (for peanuts, basically). Although you could argue that D-Rose is really the main PG for the Knicks and Elfrid Payton starts as a place holder.  But the way the award's usually awarded (aside from ""fluke"" years like when Odom won it), it goes to the flamethrower off the bench, and that's definitely Clarkson. Man will get you a bucket even if it kills him. Ingles should be closer in the race, but for 6MOTY I don't think voters will be too concerned about efficiency and versatility (which would also pump up D-Rose's case for the award)."
This game shows how important Alec Burks is. Much better team now that he’s back. Also please get healthy Derrick. Elfrid Payton is straight up unplayable
"Elfrid Payton did that, nothing changed."
Elfrid Payton sapped away any drive or intensity from the court.     He doesn't seem to have much chemistry with anybody on our roster.
Start of the second half has been peak Elfrid Payton effect
Went to my barber in the Bronx yesterday who of course is a Knicks fan.   Per sources (My Barber) :   The Knicks will win the championship and Elfrid Payton is the devil.
Show some respect to the [triple double gawd](https://www.nba.com/pelicans/sites/pelicans/files/elfrid-payton-5-triple-doubles.jpg)
He goes by the name of Elfrid Payton.
"Elfrid “4-0 in the first four games of the ‘19 season when AD, Payton, Jrue, and Randle played together” Payton"
"You know what it is, it's that shitty haircut. Elfrid Payton has a better haircut, and he sucks"
"I mean, D Rose and Burks have both missed significant amount of games and Mitch Rob played like 15 games.   Also Elfrid Payton has missed the whole year too."
You can have elfrid Payton
"Us missing IQ and Burks means that we have to play the absolute garbage-man that is Elfrid Payton 14 minutes, and he goes -8 in that time."
Knicks need to upgrade that Elfrid Payton spot in the off season
At least your starting PG isn't Elfrid Payton.
"All jokes aside, it's to make sure our bench's offense isn't complete doo-doo butter.     If Elfrid Payton is this bad playing a starting role on our team, just imagine how bad our offense will be with him playing off the bench."
Elfrid Payton is garbage and it's bothering me.
"If there is any player on the Knicks you absolutely do not have to worry about in any capacity, it is Elfrid Payton. That game was a complete fluke"
It is if the Lakers let Elfrid fucking Payton go off again

"We could sign Lonzo for 20-25 and DeMar and have money left over bro, don't tell me there aren't many great PG options when on our current roster we have Elfrid fucking Payton and an incredibly inconsistent 2 guard in Quickley. We. Need. A. Playmaker."
Knicks Rumors - Any PG who is not Elfrid Payton will be among FA targets
"Elfrid Payton is not a bad player from an individual standpoint, but his team play is much to be desired."
"Just go to the Knicks, is a downgrade from Elfrid Payton even possible"
"Cuz, they’re doing the best with what they got. They weren’t given superstars like Reggie Bullock and Elfrid Payton. They had to work hard and play for what they got. True underdog story if you ask me"
trade elfrid payton for davion mitchell     guaranteed one seed
Elfrid Payton Pritchard
until Elfrid Payton is in. lol no but seriously shoutout the Knicks they've proved all the doubters wrong and then some.
"Yeah do we really want elfrid  Payton running a unit with inferior  bench players? Our starting 5 is good enough to cancel out our terrible other Pgs a little bit, but the bench unit would be hopeless  Rose closes and plays starter minutes. That’s  what matters"
"No, but he's got some solid defenders on him.  There *is* a random designed play that is intended to look like a bailout.  I noticed that they did it with Elfrid Payton instead of Randle.  I found that interesting."
&gt;Elfrid Payton is a borderline All-Star as well  i just saw that lol
"lack of talent, athleticism, Basketball IQ. Elfrid Payton is a borderline All-Star as well"
Didn’t know Elfrid Payton started😂
I can’t understand how Elfrid Payton is allowed to play. He singlehandedly gets us into holes early. I mean he just constantly fucks up.
elfrid payton sucks
Ah yes Elfrid Payton air balling layups
"14/53 on the all time list for TDs are current players. Idk if i'd say its some commonplace achievement now. Yeah there's random dudes like Elfrid Payton on there but there are random dudes from 40 years ago too like Tom Gola.  If anything the period of 2000-2010 had an abnormally low amount of people getting TDs because the pace was slow. That was the outlier, not now."
Cam Thomas has the processing speed of Elfrid Payton off a xan
No offense but Elfrid Payton is the 3rd best PG on a fake contender. The fact that he is starting is meaningless. He deserves credit for cutting his hair but that’s it.
&gt; Elfrid Payton   lol
"Yep. Just checked, only players with a streak of five or more straight triple-doubles are Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, and Elfrid Payton."
"There is a reason Elfrid Payton is still in the NBA, who knows what that is, but it hurts not seeing Mudiay in"
"Elfrid Payton has my favorite triple double, because I put him in as my cheap dude in DFS and he won me $2,000 that day.  I will defend him to anyone that talks shit because of that. Lol"
Thats way more than I expected fro Elfrid Payton lmao
"So is Elfrid Payton, with 17"
hey... that's the magic all time triple double leader Elfrid Payton to you
"I love RJ Barrett but he fits this description kind of perfectly. Even though it’s not even his fault when he’s hot sometimes, our “point guard” Elfrid Payton doesn’t even look his way."
"&gt;The media is likely about to give you guys some “tough love” fortunately for everyone else thought all the focus will be on the Nets and Lakers losing.   It's not just that, you get media pundits like Shannon Sharpe lashing out at Knicks fans for being happy that we're not DEAD LAST in the standings and saying dumbass shit like ""You're never going to beat the 76ers, the Bucks, the Nets"" and it's like, ""Yeah, we know we're not winning a championship right now, but DAMN can we at least be happy for once???     We don't need any ""tough love"" from outside sources, TRUST. Knicks fans are harder on our team than ANY other fanbase in the NBA. However, whenever all of these dumbass fans, media guys, ex-pros start coming out at fans for having any semblance of joy for their team, that's when I get pissed off.     Also, Elfrid Payton has to be the worst starting PG in the league. I don't usually get on him too hard, but DEAR GOD, he is an active detriment to our roster and EVERYONE knows it.     Tonight, everybody did bad but that slow start in the beginning? Yeah, he could have distributed more, but I digress."
Well the Knicks are better with Elfrid Payton on the bench watching the game so that’s not really an argument.
Imagine if any player decided that getting triple doubles was their main goal for the game. Would the Knicks be any better if Elfrid Payton decided to start hunting down triple doubles?
Have you ever heard of triple double juggernaut Elfrid Payton?
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
"Damn whats going on in Indiana?  No bias but I feel like Brogdon is the reason for all of this, Pacers should trade him for Elfrid Payton tbh, again no bias"
"I agree, as a pels fan I saw this in Julius Randle already. Matter of fact he even had Elfrid Payton on that pels team too. Randle was putting up All NBA numbers the 2nd half of that season, just imagine had the Pels kept him and it was Zion and Randle playing down low with Ingram at SF. That would've been a dangerous team."
"We're already way better than those teams were, equating them doesn't make sense. We're not years and years away from a Shai or Caris leading the team, we already have an All-Star, All-NBA caliber player carrying us to the top half of playoffs. I disagree, I don't think we need some random single guy to carry us. Lonzo and Derozan with Robinson being healthy gets us to contender status. We're only a couple games behind Milwaukee with Elfrid ""Missed Layup"" Payton getting significant minutes. If we had a legitimate starter quality or better PG who buys into our defensive scheme (like Lonzo) and another scoring threat who would also benefit from our insane spacing (we're a top tier 3 point shooting team) like Derozan, and boom we're up there with the best of them."
No that’s Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton in shambles
Elfrid Payton in shambles
Elfrid Payton
Still won’t start over Elfrid Payton.
Elfrid Payton is our starting pg lmao
Elfrid Payton on a supermax
Elfrid “belongs on the shelf” Payton we are so much better with him off the court. Very rarely does he actually contribute to winning he is more of a byproduct of some of our players getting a little slow start and us not wanting to kill rose with minutes while we bring quickley along as our future point
Elfrid Payton
Edit: Fuck they should bring back just about everyone sans Elfrid Payton on reasonable deals.
"With Randles point forward duties, we don't even need a bonafide traditional PG. Imagine where the knicks would be with lonzo vs elfrid payton....."
Don't forget Elfrid Payton  #LetElfridPaytonCook
Elfrid Payton
Shit's fire tbh. Dunno why people are so damn critical about other people's hair. I love people who aren't afraid to rock an unorthodox cut. Plus it ain't anywhere near Elfrid Payton levels of distracting.
"He was a terrible GM and managed minutes poorly, but hes always been a solid Xs and Os guy. And his rotations still arent perfect, why is Elfrid Payton playing 20+ minutes a game again (they have Quickley and Ntilikina who provide more value at the PG position)?"
"Quick OP, convince him that Luka for Elfrid Payton is a good deal!"
"I mean yeah, you would? Kemba's better than fucking Elfrid Payton."
Elfrid Payton not getting done I see
question why did ja throw up that tracy mcgrady lob in the 3rd? did he really think he was going to jump all over everybody? that was so stupid he made me think he was elfrid payton for a sec
"&gt;Michael Ray Richardson, Fat Lever and Rajon Rondo  Those guys were on a different level than Elfrid Payton and MCW."
"Did you ever stop to think about why those few in particular might be getting a ton of triple doubles, rather than the literal dozens of other ball handlers that are way better than Elfrid Payton? Why the likes of Michael Ray Richardson, Fat Lever and Rajon Rondo are way up there on all time lists despite many other guards of their eras being better?  Yeah a 50% decline in people who aren’t bigs grabbing bulk rebounds. That’s not a point in your favour. Non-bigs who could rebound well have always done so throughout league history. Wings littered the top of the RPG leaderboards throughout the 80s and 90s to a much higher degree than they do today. Anybody who was using their brain would look at two guards rebounding significantly more than any other guards, any small forwards and the vast majority of power forwards and go “Man, those two guards in particular must be very good rebounders” rather than “Oh guess the whole league’s fucked then”.  I actually just forgot you pulled out that bullshit talking point about assists but it’s barely worth mentioning anyway. People have been complaining about scorers handing out easy assists since at least the 80s, if not longer. It dogged Stockton in particular through his entire career. There’s nothing empirical at all to suggest that scorers are more lenient now than they were 30-40 years ago."
"&gt;hey, while we’re talking about Elfrid Payton, if that scrub can pick up 17, modern guards that are actually good must be absolutely rolling right?  Yes. We've been through a few of them. Harden, Luka, Westbrook.   &gt;a whopping 6 non-centres feature in the top 20 in the league in RPG. Not like 30 years ago where men were men and Bill Laimbeer sodomised anybody under 6’4 on court, and there were only 11 non-centres in the top 20.  That's almost a 50% decline, my guy. Besides which, ""positions played by the top 20 in RPG"" is a strange framework to test the hypothesis that guards are rebounding more.   Your silence on the assist factors speaks volumes."
"Yeah, LeBron. Who didn’t get as many triple doubles as Lance Stephenson that year because getting triple doubles isn’t the same thing as having a good game.  But hey, while we’re talking about Elfrid Payton, if that scrub can pick up 17, modern guards that are actually good must be absolutely rolling right? Like Chris Paul, who has 16. Or John Wall, who has 8. Or Steph Curry, who has 7. Those newfangled 7 foot ball handlers probably have him covered though, like Durant with his 12, or Cousins with his 9. Or maybe Payton just has a knack for it and you’ve intentionally picked by far the biggest outlier in this regard to massively misrepresent how easy it is to get triple doubles.  As for pace, it is certainly up relative to the league historically, if you think the league started in 2009. As for rebounding, yeah it’s crazy how many small guys are pulling down big numbers with those long rebounds these days. That’s why a whopping 6 non-centres feature in the top 20 in the league in RPG. Not like 30 years ago where men were men and Bill Laimbeer sodomised anybody under 6’4 on court, and there were only 11 non-centres in the top 20. Of course if you want to count PFs as “bigs” then the story radically changes, where there are two non-bigs this year and... three... thirty years ago. Funny how that works."
instead of Elfrid Payton? challenging for 2 seed
"&gt;because Elfrid Payton is the master of the terrible 10/10/10  ... and because it's much easier to post a terrible 10/10/10 than it has been in previous eras. Official scorers are looser with assists, plus you can rack up easy ones from randos jacking threes. All those threes lead to longer rebounds and they drag bigs (of which there are fewer even getting playing time in the first place) away from the paint so guards and wings can rack up boards. And of course pace is up too.  &gt;The stat people like you usually like to pull out is that year that Lance Stephenson lead the league in triple doubles, because he only had 5. Think about who was in the league when that happened, and how none of them got as many triple doubles as Lance. It’s not an era thing, it’s a skill set thing.   Maybe you've heard of this cat named LeBron?"
"Yeah, because Elfrid Payton is the master of the terrible 10/10/10, and more importantly Scottie Pippen was never a primary playmaker for his teams or all that focused on rebounding.  Having the skill set necessary to get a triple double isn’t the same thing as being amazing, or even necessarily that good. The stat people like you usually like to pull out is that year that Lance Stephenson lead the league in triple doubles, because he only had 5. Think about who was in the league when that happened, and how none of them got as many triple doubles as Lance. It’s not an era thing, it’s a skill set thing. Guards didn’t used to rebound, but the few who could (Kidd, Magic, Robertson) got triple doubles for fun. Now guards who focus on (and have the sizer for) rebounding is more common. Bigs never used to be the primary offensive creators for their teams, the few who were (Wilt, Russell, Barkley) were all very much capable of getting triple doubles too."
9 of the top 20 career triple-double leaders are active players. Elfrid Payton is tied with Scottie Pippen. Once more for the people in the back. ELFRID PAYTON IS TIED WITH SCOTTIE PIPPEN.
"Nah, he trash, and the Knicks dodged a bullet by not getting him. I thought the ""stat padding"" was a meme because he was on a bad team, but this dude is brain dead on D and bricks as many layups as Elfrid payton."
My top 5:  1. Elfrid Payton  2. Frank Ntilikina  3. Tacko Fall  4. Cory Joseph  5. Lebron James
"So you're telling me...given the (extremely unrealistic) choice between keeping Elfrid goddamn Payton and getting Dame, you'd keep Elfrid? This has to be the hottest take I've ever seen"
"At this point with both Randle and RJ playing as well as they are with likely more improvement on the way, we don't necessarily need a superstar in this free agency. What we need is an actual back court rotation not involving Elfrid Payton and a couple better SFs to stick next to Randle. What makes our record so incredible is even if Randle was this good last year, just based on our roster alone nobody would've bet we make it above the 8th seed. Better depth and decent upgrades to pair with our stars is enough to get us to that next level, and then in 2022 we can get a big pickup and possibly become legitimate contenders."
The crazy thing is the team has sustained absences and injuries. Burks and Robinson are hurt right now. Noel sprained his ankle tonight. Rose missed a ton of time. We also start Elfrid Payton at PG. Jk he's not that bad.
"They actually got the deal wrong, it was for the Elfrid Payton pick.   The Payton pick was traded for the Saric pick, the Willy Hernangomez pick, and the Landry Shamet pick."
"Dillion Brooks, Elfrid Payton and Andre Drummond"
Lavine yes.  Derozan no.  Knicks already lack shooters in their starting line-up and Derozan only adds to it.  Unless he is replacing Elfrid Payton than yeah go for it.
"It's more than that though. He had an underwhelming year at Duke (was the year they lost go CJ McCollum and Lehigh I think in the first round), then still get's drafted 10th overall because of his potential. Looks like a total bust for the first 3-4 years of his career, then gets traded to the Clippers and turns into a decent role player. Shuffles around to a couple teams and keeps it up, then ends up on the Knicks this year where he gets dropped from the rotation for... Elfrid Payton???  And now he's back to being decent for the Nuggets I guess?"
Knick fans and Elfrid Payton
Glad to see he's doing well! Definitely not jealous the Knicks didn't pick him up. Definitely.  ^(Please get rid of Elfrid Payton :()
Elfrid Payton is too high on this list. So many guys on the Knicks that are being free agents are better than him
Because Elfrid Payton being the PG for our bench unit would be disastrous for their offense.
I get where you’re coming from but don’t forget - MPJ has Jokic. Randle has Elfrid Payton.
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
That’s because elfrid Payton is the worst starting point guard in the NBA
Sounds like the Elfrid Payton special to me
CJ pretty active online for someone who might get traded for Elfrid Payton and a bunch of picks
Elfrid Payton
"Mike james isiah cannon tyson chandler trevor ariza josh jackson elfrid payton eric bledsoe brandon knight dragen bender marqueese chris   If you think those guys are comparable to Porzingas, Seth Curry, Tim Hardway Jr then idk what to tell you.  When booker got a real team around him they became instantly better and probably make the playoffs is ayton doesnt get suspended"
"Never had a real playmaker/main ball handler for long. Two times we made the playoffs we had Tyreke evans (and jrue was injured most of this season) and then Rondo, other than that our PGs were Tim Frazier and Elfrid payton lol"
Elfrid Payton wants a spot on the squad
"You’re crazy if you don’t think Devin Booker is an off ball player. We had rubio (2nd in assists last year) and now cp3. DBook is a legitimate shooting guard, but so much of his career was playing with backcourts of 39 y/o Jamal Crawford, Isiah Canaan, Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton (for like 30 games), and end-of-career Brandon knight.   He had to be ball dominant, so nowadays he can be for stretches, especially if he’s hot or if the offense has gone cold. But don’t get it twisted, he’s more off ball than he is on ball."
jrue plays like elfrid payton on offense and gary payton on defense
"He played like KD today. So get ready for Khris ""Elfrid Payton"" Middleton next game lol."
Your overestimating Colin Sexton even if he’s miles better than Elfrid Payton.  Remember Boston had major chemistry issues and huge COVID absences.  Miami is still funky as a whole because Butler and Bam were never right at the same time.   The Knicks were largely healthy outside of Mitchell Robinson.  At the end of the day I don’t know what Sexton does especially if Randle drops off from last year which is highly possible.  Cap Space and chasing free agents seems better than locking into the 12th best point guard in the NBA if you squint.
We made it to the 4th seed with Elfrid fucking Payton as our PG but these nerds will tell us we're going nowhere if we replace him with Sexton lol
"I mean, if we retain Frank Ntilikina and trade for Dennis Smith Jr., the two of them with Elfrid Payton could combine to put up 85 points to squeeze out one more win."
Would you rather have Ayton fused with Elfrid Payton or Giannis fused with Jordan Bell
&gt;Mook really redeemed his value this season imo. One of the Clippers strengths is that they can go small and run 5-out spacing and he was a key piece in dismantling Utah in the playoffs.   Oh I agree but that type of strategy is redundant when you have KAT on your team lol.  &gt;I was originally on the idea of a Mook/Rubio trade but I actually think the Clippers would decline that now. A big piece of why I was originally for it was I felt that Ibaka could cover the spacing concerns but it looks like he may have some durability issues moving forward.   I think so too and being on a team with PG and Kawhi seems to have reined in some of his bad personality habits tbh.  &gt;My gag-worthy idea of LAC getting playmakers is swapping PatBev for Eric Bledsoe and signing Elfrid Payton to a vet min - bargain bin baby!  Bledsoe would probably work better for the LAC tbh. He's not the shooter Bev is but he's a much better defender and I think overall as a scorer he's a lot better. The issue is he crumbles in the playoffs.

"Thibs usually isn't a coach who plays rookies, Obi Toppin didn't get a lot of run either. Pretty sure they only used Quickley because Elfrid Payton is trash  That said I wasn't impressed by Knox's offensive game last year"
Elfrid Payton has done the Knicks no favors
Jrue Holiday is actually Elfrid Payton with a mask.  Change my mind.
"Below Jordan, above Elfrid Payton"
"Elfrid Payton got injured and then Davis checked out because Rich Paul ""educated"" him (/s), leading to Mirotic being traded mid-season. Case in point, if you traded Davis for a guaranteed 75 games of everybody else on the opening day roster, they probably still make the playoffs."
Lol these comments give me headaches. KD and kyrie didn’t even fucking play and he won player of the month on the nets both months while healthy and lead the league in assist. But yes elfrid payton LOL
Tbf he also had an elite shooting guard and KD backing him up. Elfrid Payton probably could’ve been successful with those two.
"No one on the Knicks can create their own shot besides Randle, RJ, and Quickley on occasion   They were literally one of the worst offenses in the league and Elfrid Payton was one of the worst regular rotation players in the league"
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.  Suns: Prime CP3, Booker, Ayton, Crowder, Bridges, 76ers Saric, Hornets Kaminsky, Pelicans E'Twaun Moore.  Warriors: Steph, Klay, Draymond, T-Wolves Wiggins, Hawks Bazemore, Wizards Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee, Paschall.  Heat: Jimmy, Iggy, Oladipo, Dragic, Bam, Ariza, Haslem, Herro, Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Bjelica.  Blazers: Lillard, Melo, CJ, Nurkic, Covington, Kanter, Norman Powell, Hollis-Jefferson.  Bucks: Giannis, Lopez, Holiday, Middleton, Teague, Portis, Tucker, Forbes.  Knicks: MVP Rose, Randle, Barrett, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel, Pistons Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks, Quickley."
It was a failure tho. They haven’t made it out of the 2nd round and their 2nd best player is a taller Elfrid Payton
"Like you guys had Mike James, Isaiah Canaan, Tyler Ullis, Shaquille Harrison, Elfrid Payton, Eric ""I don't want to be here"" Bledsoe through the years."
"&gt; lmao your team is trying to trade for upgrades and the biggest assets you can dangle is KCP and kuzma which is a running joke at this point and nobody wants them  The bigger issue right now is getting healthy.  &gt;Caruso is a solid starter, I'll give ya that. Half your fanbase including magic johnson wants to kick schroder to the curb so.. yeah alright  He’s overpaid, not bad.  &gt;morris is crap, gasol is washed, harrell gets played off the floor in the playoffs. drummond is honestly better than the criticism he gets but still closer to a bench player than starter caliber  Morris is solid, washed Gasol shot 60% from 3 versus the Suns, Harrell is fine.  &gt;you're like crazy delusional about your team man, I'm not out here saying elfrid payton and kevin knox are amazing awesome players  Those are legitimately net negative players. Still spouting that BS huh"

"Elie Okobo, Josh Gray, Shaquille Harrison, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Davon Reed, Elfrid Payton, etc. etc.  SO MANY G League point guards were sacrificed to the point god for this finals berth."
"As you mentioned, Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum may be gone and if that's the case then they're kind of fucked (more with the Batum thing - I don't think there's another bargain-bin wing available that can replace his production).   I'd love to see Rubio on the team but he's slightly overpaid enough to the point where it's hard for the Clippers to salary match unless the Wolves want Luke Kennard or something (maybe there's a 3-team trade somewhere).  I still kind of think they should go with a budget playmaker. If they can't retain Reggie Jackson, I literally think they should go for a PatBev/Eric Bledsoe swap and sign Elfrid Payton to a vet min. The issue with both of those guys though is that it kills their 5-out spacing when they go small (but hell they might already lose that if Reggie and Batum walk)."
"When questioned on the system, he got annoyed and said something along the lines of ""the Rockets do it every game and no one complains.""  1) A ton of people complained about the Rockets's offense, including the Rockets.  2) The Rockets had James Harden and CP3/Westbrook running the show while the Knicks had Randle and Elfrid Payton."
"Fiz described his offense as ""eat what you kill"". What this looked like on the court was Julius Randle spinning into triple teams, Elfrid Payton only passing to Randle, and a rookie Kevin Knox playing 30 minutes a night chucking up the ugliest floaters you've ever seen. Zero accountability. Absolute shitshow."
It's such a treat to see RJ play without Elfrid Payton in the lineup. He actually gets to touch the ball for once.
"The only good one of these was when Elfrid Payton got traded and one of the top comments was ""end of a hair-a"""
"Elfrid Payton and Nerlens Noel!  Elfrid Payton will always make sure he's not a huge scorer for you.  I was so excited for him at the beginning of the season when he was hitting shots, like when we blew out the Bucks."
"I am worried about the Knicks ruining their new team culture by trading guys away to try to get a star, especially one that doesn't fit perfectly, but a big sore spot for the Knicks was having only 2 guys trusted to guard small forwards (RJ and Reggie Bullock), and they were 2 of the only guys who would be trusted in the clutch to guard shooting guards. I don't want RJ to play 46+ minutes in back to back games ever again unless its conference finals or finals and overtime both times. I would be ok with the Knicks trading for Ben Simmons if they don't have to give up Randle, RJ, Reggie Bullock, or Immanuel Quickley. I think losing Derrick Rose would be unavoidable, he seems like the only one outside of those players the Sixers would actually want. If we get Alec Burks back, RJ keeps improving his 3pt shot, and Randle keeps shooting like a god, it might not be terrible spacing, at least not worse than with Frank Ntilikina (yes I know he shot like 40% from 3 this year but a lot of them were uncontested corner 3s in garbage time) or Elfrid Payton (as long as we forget the first 5 games of the season where he looked like discount MVP Westbrook)."
Because Fred is a good PG on a good contract and you have Elfrid Payton as your starting PG.
"Alright, you twisted my arm, we'll trade Elfrid Payton for, just about anyone to be honest."
You’d be lucky to get Lowry for a taller version of Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton gets banned from stepping into any Knicks related facility/arena  and we acquire an all-star caliber PG and or SF. Also re-signing D Rose and Taj Gibson would be nice
Portland can I interest you in one Elfrid Payton
"Idk how people can see quotes like this and still think it's crazy that the Suns (or some other team) will pay Chris Paul a lot of money in the offseason. Part of that contract is for his play and part of it is to make sure you get the most out of your young players. I have a feeling CP3 makes it much more likely that Ayton lives up to/outplays his own contract.          Also between this quote and Anthony Edwards saying the other day that Rubio was the most important person for his success this past season, it should be clear to every rebuilding GM that the *very first* move they make should be to bring in a veteran PG and floor general. We've seen over and over again that they have a disproportionate impact on the rest of the team and it's the best way to make sure the young players you spend high draft picks and max extensions on reach their full potential. Just in the last two years we've seen CP3 help OKC, Rubio help Phoenix last year, CP3 with Phoenix this year, Rubio helping Anthony Edwards, Rose turning around Barrett and the Knicks (and maybe others I'm forgetting). Idk how many times teams will keep bringing in MCW, Elfrid Payton, whoever the Bulls have had recently, etc before they realize that it sets back a whole rebuild and limits the potential of young players (who are the ones who you really need to get back to playoff/championship contention)."
Who's Cameron Payton? Elfrid Payton's brother?
He’s be a huge upgrade to Elfrid Payton. Not sure if he can shoot as well with that nasty Knicks spacing tho
The disrespect for elfrid Payton is unreal. He def deserves contention for this
How bout another knicks point guard. Elfrid Payton is easily the worst starter in the league. Watching him dribble into the paint and barely hit the backboard is a form of torture
"Our team wasn’t even supposed to make the playoffs, we had Elfrid Payton and Reggie bullock starting for us. We overachieved. You guys had 3 Hof in their prime"
"Nah there’s a reason Rivers couldn’t even hold a roster spot on the *Knicks* of all teams. Like he couldn’t stay on a team that started Elfrid Payton. You may be underestimating how much better Jokic makes guards look, and they still looked really bad in the suns series"
Elfrid Payton Kevin Knox and a future 1st round pick
Fuck we can't send Elfrid Payton there then &gt;:(
"I know there will be a lot of excuses about this but Reddish is one of the most inefficient shooters in the entire NBA and has been for two straight years. He didn't play enough games to qualify but his 48.8% TS% would have ranked second to last in the entire league, just above Elfrid Payton. His Win shares per 48 puts him near the bottom 10 in the league as well. His PER would have been 8th worst in the league.  Why would you want this guy to see the floor at all during playoff basketball?"
"On one hand Chris Paul. On the other, Elfrid Payton"
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
Anything would be better than Elfrid Payton starting for Knicks
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
Lmao Elfrid Payton for the Knicks is accurate
"Elfrid Payton, lmao  At least you know how bad he's fucked us"
I prefer Ben Simmons to Elfrid Payton tbh.
Cameron Payne is who I thought Elfrid Payton was going to be.
"I think there’s no blanket right answer for this. I think situation and context really matter. BPA I believe is a smart approach when your cupboard is bare and you’re searching for THE guy. But look at the Hawks. Once they got their guy in Trae Young, Atlanta drafted BPA at positions they needed to fill around Trae, and now they’re in the ECF way ahead of schedule. I think Orlando is a better example than Philly of BPA gone wrong, actually. Oladipo and Elfrid Payton in B2B drafts, taking Aaron Gordon while they’re investing in Tobias Harris, and then tanking another raw wing in Hezonjia in 2015, all while playing often through the slower, more methodical Vucevic down low. Channing Frye compared all those pieces to “rats climbing a ladder.”"
"“He’s an upgrade over Elfrid Payton”  “Get him while his value is low”  “Oh, so now the Knicks are too good for Ben Simmons?”"
"Of the assets that Hinkie acquired:  Covington, Saric, Jerami Grant, 2018 1st (from MCW trade, Mikal Bridges), 2018 1st (from Elfrid Payton trade, Shamet), 2019 1st (from Nik Stauskas trade)  were in part turned into  Butler (gone)  Harris (who was then given a max deal)  Maxey (who ironically enough the Sixers traded the pick earlier for some euro guy who never panned out and only got it back in the Fultz dump)  Mike Muscala (who helped them get the pick that turned into Maxey by making a game winning shot while he was with OKC)  Also, I think technically the pick the Sixers gained from the Bridges-for-Zhaire Smith trade was in the Tobias Harris trade, and LAC traded it to OKC in the PG13 trade."
Will you take Elfrid Payton back?
"Crazy to think that in that span 76ers hit big on Embiied and missed with Michael Carter/Nerlens Noel in the 2013 draft (could have had CJ Mccolllum, Giannis, Gobert), Elfrid Payton in the 2014 Draft (could have had Lavine or TJ Warren), Jhalil Okafor in the 2015 Draft (could have had Kristaps or Booker), Simmons in 2016 Draft (this may not be fair yet but could have had Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray) and finally Fultz in the 2017 Draft (could have had Tatum or Fox).     Really is not fair to do that, because hindisght is 20:20 and at the time a lot of those picks lined up with conesensus expectations.  I also like to exclude Giannis because over half the nba passed on him but it's crazy to think Philly could trot out a starting 5 of:   PG: McCollum/Murray  SG:Booker  SF:Tatum  PF: Warren  C: Embiid"
"&gt; The whole “Process” thing would actually make sense if Stinkie was actually a GM with basketball smarts who could hit higher than average on some draft picks  A lot of people say this and don't seem to get one of the most important pillars of the process (among many other things). Hinkie was aware enough of the fact that him and most others can't consistently strike gold on the draft (not everyone is Presti and his staff). It's about understanding that there's only so much you can control- so it made sense to accumulate as many chances as possible at striking gold. If it wasn't gold, then the idea was to flip them for more chances after selling high (Elfrid Payton, Hermangomez, MCW, KJ McDaniels, Wolters, etc)."
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
"Elfrid payton, take it or leave it"
Elfrid Payton is tweeting from a burner account somewhere in the world full of salt over this comment
After watching Knicks squads with shit spacing for the last few years I find it hard to believe that Philly will be able to get much value back from teams for him in a trade. Elfrid Payton was a better scorer than Ben and there's negative chance he's in the league next year
Ben Simmons is Elfrid Payton with the supersoldier serum.
The man dropped 30 and 11 on a torn meniscus while the Australian Elfrid Payton sat in the post doing diddly shit
You must not know Elfrid Payton
Ben “Elfrid Payton” Simmons
He’s more like Elfrid Payton
Ben has been studying at the Elfrid Payton school of Point Guarding for years now
Australian Elfrid Payton 🔥🔥🔥
I have never seen a player more devoid of confidence and i watched Elfrid Payton and Frank ntilikina play all year
Trying to imagine what it would be like if the Knicks didn’t trade for Harden because the FO wanted to hold on to Elfrid Payton. Now replace the Knicks with the Sixers and Payton with Simmons 😂😂
Elfrid Payton would like to have a chat with you.
Vegemite Elfrid Payton has more fouls than points...
"No, he’s the best example of a shit player who has exactly the right kind of play style and skill set to put up a bunch of god awful triple doubles. That’s why he has so many more than a bunch of superstar modern players. Again, it’s an Elfrid Payton thing, not a modern inflation thing."
I’m a Knicks fan bro I had to live through two years of Elfrid Payton. He’s the best example of why it’s inflated and that’s why I used him for my argumentative
"You ever notice how every time this conversation happens it’s always Elfrid Payton specifically that comes up, and never any other random scrub?  But hey, if we want to talk about Elfrid Payton and his consecutive triple doubles, let’s do it. It’s a lot. More than LeBron’s ever had. More than Harden. More than Giannis. More than Jokic. Or maybe you want to talk about his career total of 17, which is also a lot. More than Chris Paul. Or Kevin Durant. Or Jimmy Butler. Or Blake Griffin. Or Steph Curry. Or Trae Young.  Maybe it’s an Elfrid Payton thing and not a stat inflation thing. Not possible…"
Elfrid Payton had like a 5 game stretch of triple doubles. It’s inflated my guy
"&gt;  he's a guy who can score   He's kinda inefficient and can't really shoot. When some teams are starting guys like Elfrid Payton, sure Spencer is a starter PG by that standard, but he's not really that great to justify 12M+ per year specifically when coming off from a big injury."
Jrue playing with big Elfrid Payton energy right now.
"Ben Simmons is just a tall Elfrid Payton, change my mind"
"Both games we lost CP3 looked like a smarter version of Elfrid Payton, cmon man."
I would like to point out that both games we lost CP3 looked like a smarter version of Elfrid Payton. So I think those games would look very diferent if CP was healthy. Same as if AD was healthy.
Better than Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton?
Elfrid Payton to North Korea League
"He's definitely an upgrade over Elfrid Payton, its just that with his age, injury history and salary, you wouldn't really want it."
Can't be worse than Elfrid Payton?
"No, the dudes they brought in said Elfrid Payton was better than Stauskas, but Vivek was dead set on taking Stauskas."
I'll trade you Elfrid Payton and 2 first round picks?
"Elfrid Payton started games for a playoff team this year. Yeah, I think Ben would still be in the NBA."
"Some of us were trying to tell you he's an oversized Elfrid Payton years ago, but hyped fans didn't want to hear that so"
"Most of these aren't that bad. Chris Kaman, Elfrid Payton, and Boozer's dyejob are all worse."
Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton.
There is a big gap between Elfrid Payton and Draymond Green lol
Elfrid Payton
elfrid payton
"Evan Turner, Maurice Harkless, MCW, Elfrid Payton, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz  That one time they drafted Mikael Bridges but opted to trade him for Zhaire Smith.. idk how much of who overruling who at that time but the scoutings were def into Zhaire Smith enough to convince acting GM Brett Brown to pull that trade"
Elfrid Payton was huge in allowing the hawks to beat the Knicks
Knicks. It’s not like I’m going to be any worse than Elfrid Payton
PG: Jerome Robinson SG: Elfrid Payton SF: Josh Jackson PF: Bertans C: Baynes
Elfrid Payton
"Tbf we didn't really have much of an option haha. Julius Randle's stats weren't bad but he was not nearly the same player as last season; he was a crazy beyblade lmao. Marcus Morris, while a good player, is not great as arguably our #1 scoring option.   Also, because the coach wasn't Thibs, guys didn't play 40 minutes per game. I don't think a starting lineup of Elfrid Payton, RJ, Morris, Randle, Gibson playing 40 minutes would have helped us win that many more games haha. Minutes were spread around because everyone sucked and no one really solidified spots in the rotation. Team was a mess and there was no consistency, which is why last season was so shocking. I hope we make the playoffs this year but we're far from a lock imo"
"Summer league or not, a blind player with no fingers or thumbs would be an upgrade over Elfrid Payton"
"Nerlens Noel, Mitchell Robinson are top defenders at their position. Reggie Bullock was a solid defender last year, Elfrid payton (despite being garbage) is a decent defender, RJ is coming to his own on defense. Miles McBride looks like he has the tools to be a great defender."
"This narrative is so old. The only guys who played more than 30MPG last year were Randle and RJ and technically Bullock (who hit 30.0 on the dot).  Derrick Rose and the whisps of cartilage that remain in his knees played 27 minutes a game, which was very manageable until the playoffs when we literally could not play Elfrid Payton anymore.  This year with Kemba and Rose plus guys like McBride and IQ able to soak up some lead guard minutes Kemba and Rose will be fine."
"He played that level of minutes in the playoffs because the alternative was playing Elfrid Payton.   Thibs managed Rose well during the regular season. I can definitely see Rose/Kemba platooning at the guard spot, ~25 minutes per game for each give or take depending on their health/rest/game flow."
and he only played that much because Elfrid Payton would constantly leave us with no choice but to pull him from the game  Kemba &amp; McBride are not Elfrid Payton
"the knicks won more and that is reflected in the team stats. my point was Kat hasdlo malik beasly and ant edwards - knicks had barett elfrid Payton, mitchell robinson? Knicks are a better team but I would argue they are not as talented as Twolves.  Is it really impressive that KAT led the twolves to a worse season with better players?  knicks did more with less but maybe it is due to just Thibs coaching."
Suns have Devin Booker and Elfrid Payton (although Elfrid played like 1/3 of that season in Phoenix).
I summon...Elfrid Payton
I think you are severely underrating the addition of those two players especially when you consider who they are replacing. Kemba Walker is replacing Elfrid fucking Payton who was easily the worst starter on a playoff team last year. Drose coming on to the starting lineup ended up scrambling our second unit and making them really ineffective. Trae Young was able to hide and rest on defense because Reggie Bullock can’t dribble. You saw what he did on a 2-1 fast break in that series smfh. Replacing him with Fournier means the Trae has no where to hide. I would agree with you that our rookies aren’t going to have a big impact unless one of them really break out and Thibs gives them big mins. RJ is really the swing factor. If he has the 3rd year star wing leap then we would be in great shape. And finally we have Mitchell Robinson. He is the biggest defensive and even offensive piece we missed last year. He is one of the best if not the best lob catcher in the league which would force Capela to not shade Randle whenever he has the ball. Mitch is also one of the best rebounders in the league. His overall rebounding numbers don’t show it on the surface but he led the league in box outs and the Knicks were the best rebounding team in the league when he was healthy. All this to say that it will be a far more interesting series if we play next year and I hope it happens.
Wonder if Monty will be able to do the same for Elfrid Payton
"They started with a record of 17-20 and after the Derrick Rose trade went 24-11 which is equivalent to 56 wins over an 82 game season. Their final record of 41-31 is equivalent to 47-35, the swapping of Elfrid Payton (who I cannot stress enough as a complete negative on the court) and Reggie Bullock for Kemba and Fournier as well as the improvement in the young players and hopefully healthy Mitchell Robinson means 50 wins is a realistic expectation. Kemba may not perform like he used to but is a GINORMOUS upgrade over Elfrid Payton"
RJ Barrett will have the best career out of anyone from the 2019 draft.   He was the second best payer as a sophomore on a 4th seeded team that this offseason got significantly better by replacing Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. RJ himself has shown an incredible amount of progress and commitment to keeping that progress going.   Ja Morant’s Grizzlies will continue to be too good to get another high pick while also not being good enough to compete for a title. The Pelicans failed to make the play-in tournament twice and Zion will ultimately have his talents wasted there like AD and CP3
"Was such a fucking joke lol, have never seen a player whose stats are so misleading than 2020 Elfrid Payton"
Literally all he has to do is not be Elfrid Payton. He could sit on the sideline in a wheelchair and he's still an upgrade. You have no idea how low the bar has been set
"love the username - I'm not expecting Charlotte Kemba but literally any guard is better than Elfrid Payton and if Kemba can even just be Boston Kemba it's a huge step forward for us. Kemba was pretty good as a team defender under Steve Clifford, I think he can fit into a Thibs system really well, especially since he'll only have to play =&lt;25 minutes per game"
You ever see Elfrid Payton play? No amount of inefficiency from Kemba will be as bad as 20 minutes of Elf
Elfrid Payton... no? Ok
RJ Barrett is the Knicks franchise guy and he got iced out for long stretches of games during his first year due to Elfrid Payton/bad coaching under Fizdale  If you find yourself doing something in common with the pre-Thibs Knicks you're probably doing something wrong
Passing up the three to get denied at the rim gives me Elfrid Payton vibes and not in a good way
PG - Elfrid Payton  SG - Denzel Valentine  SF - Kelly Oubre Jr.  PF - Kyle Kuzma  C - Andre Drummond
"Denzel Valentine, Andre Drummond, Elfrid Payton, Jeff Teague, Kelly Oubre, Kyle Kuzma, Mario Hezonja, Dwayne Bacon, Caleb Martin, Hassan Whiteside"
"""Knicks franchise PG"" Elfrid Payton. Lmao where did that thread go?"
"Lol this is a tired slant with no basis in reality. Fuck off.  We've got a long history of developing players. Vooch, Fournier, Afflalo, Dwight, Jameer Nelson (All Star), Rashard Lewis (became All Star in Orlando), JJ Redick, Courtney Lee, even Gordon (he's still the same player in Denver he was in Orlando). Isaac is becoming a monster when healthy, we revived Fultz's career.    Ryan Anderson won MIP here and so did Hedo, TMac, and Scott Skiles.  We have drafted shitty players like Elfrid Payton but its not like another team could develop him. Dipo has had 1.5 good seasons since he left Orlando. Harris was here for like 4 seasons and you can certainly claim we whiffed on him but he's not even an all star and we didn't draft him. Who the fuck are you actually referring to that we didn't develop?"
Elfrid Payton is the answer
"Come on, it’s Elfrid Payton we’re talking about here. 11/11/10 on 4/13 and 7 turnovers with a sub-90 offensive rating."
"Friendship ended with Darrell Armstrong, Penny Hardaway, Jameer Nelson, Rafer Alston, Elfrid Payton lol, DJ Augustin, Markelle Fultz and the black hole Cole Anthony.  New best friend is Jalen Suggs"
"CP3 will whisper things to Elfrid and make him look good. So next season r/nba can constantly post shit like ""WHY DID THE KNICKS NOT RE-SIGN ELFRID PAYTON?!"""
we beat the elfrid payton accusations
Elfrid Payton is available
we spent a whole year with elfrid payton we already had the full Bacon experience
man FUCK this dude is selfish as hell. I knew we'd have an Elfrid Payton this year
Huge win for the knicks simply by addition by subtraction. Now Elfrid Payton won't start anymore games and the Knicks either get healthy kemba for like 60games or not healthy kemba but still no payton
Pretty low-risk but high reward move honestly if can get back to Point Justise.  What other kind of ball-handler can the Clippers expect to get anyways? I was advocating for Elfrid Payton on a minimum but other than that I got nothing.  Also for what it's worth him and PatBev combine to over 15M in salary.
Boy have you seen Elfrid Payton?
Can we sign Jarrett Jack instead of Elfrid Payton?
"James Jones isn't always right and Monty can't fix Elfrid just because of Cam Payne. Elfrid Payton will probably matter at some point, it's dumb to defend it as meaningless.  Damian Jones was a bad signing. Probably didn't need Galloway AND Moore, lacked front court depth.  Teams should use both two way slots it's ridiculous not to."
no but its a vast upgrade over Elfrid Payton as the starting PG
"Schroeder to Boston would be such a disaster. Wouldn't you just rather keep Kris Dunn? Actually, you should have just traded Thompson for Delon Wright!  But even if you messed up on all that, wouldn't Elfrid Payton have gone there rather than be 3rd string in Phoenix?  Brad Stevens - bad start!"
"This thread is going to be mostly memes but I met most of the 2019-2020 Knicks team at a pre-season ticket holder event. Randle, RJ &amp; Mitch were super chill. Dennis Smith Jr. said I looked familiar for some reason, lol. Knox was really nice as well.   Elfrid Payton was there too but I didn’t want to meet him, lol."
or just don’t make Elfrid Payton of all people your hero.
"serious answer (just from a regular fan's impressions):  elfrid payton averaged 7.2 assists a game in 19/20, close to the top 10 for the season. he attacks the basket. he gets flak for his defense but some advanced stats contradict that and he played a lot of minutes for a good defensive team last year. he seems to have a good attitude and is liked by his team.  the bad, basically, is he cannot shoot from virtually anywhere. useless at three and the midrange, and not really a great at the rim, for all how he likes to drive. he does not get to the line.  he is a good passer but he ""assist hunts"", holding the ball until an opportunity to get an assist presents itself from the efforts of other players. he does not seem to really understand the flow of a basketball game the way say, Lowry does, who will pass the ball off, move around, get it back, pass it again, etc. with payton he just dribbles until he sees someone get open and if time runs out he tries to take it to the rim. if someone doubles he passes but if not he chucks something up. it is really not very pretty, even if it produces gaudy assist numbers on bad teams.  he was a terrible fit on the NYK, particularly with RJ Barrett, though RJ's remarkable ability to transform himself into a quality catch and shoot 3 point guy mitigated that a bit. but ultimately, you already had two guys (Randle and Barrett) who wanted to run at the basket and then pass (three even if you count Rose). Payton was clearly worse than all three of them. he tried hard to improve this year - his APG going down is actually a sign of him trying to play the ""right way."" but he was really no good.  overall this is a perfectly good pickup for the suns for their third string point guard. he may have chemistry with some of phoenix's bigs (they have a few). he may benefit from paul's leadership/coaching. but even if payton managed to add a shot (a huge if at this point) he just doesn't really seem to feel the game the way you want a point guard to these days. i doubt he turns it around at this point but i'm rooting for him, as i said he seems like an ok guy."
I was at Rolling Loud a few years ago IN MY ELFRID PAYTON JERSEY and I saw him and he still wouldn’t take a picture with me. It was devastating.
We have already been through the Elfrid Payton experience. Luckily he will be our 3rd guard now instead of our starter like he was before
This is why I shake my head whenever I see anyone criticizing the Kemba signing...  Kemba at 70% of his old self on a 8 mill contract is a million times better than having Elfrid fuckin Payton as your team's starting point guard.
"Elfrid ""Triple Double Streak"" Payton"
That’s definetly not true about the Knicks lol what are you smoking? They have the same roster as last year but replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier
"We replaced Reggie bullock with Evan Fournier and we added kemba walker instead of Elfrid Payton and we didn’t improve? 🤣 you’re too much. Refer to the last line of my previous comment   Also, no one was signing with the Lakers when they were shit in the 2010s. Were they a small market during that time?"
Due to injuries the Knicks have decided to bring back Elfrid Payton
Randle also had to do a lot of stuff last year playing with Elfrid Payton that he won’t have to do with Kemba. We had the worst starting PG in the league. Interested to see how he adjusts to not having to initiate the offense as much.
Better at everting than who? Elfrid Payton? He was the best guard on our team by a fuckin country mile
Frank shooting like elfrid payton
"You’re getting downvoted cause they didn’t get worse - as of yesterday knicks fans thought they were done at pg. he’s basically replacing Elfrid Payton which will be an upgrade from last year mixing in minutes with rose, quickley, McBride"
I can beat Elfrid Payton 1 on 1
"You think Lowry pushes the heat above the Knicks? Lowry is better than Dragic yeah, but I'd argue the Knicks improved more with Fournier and Kemba compared to Bullock and Elfrid Payton.  The Hawks worked the Knicks in the playoffs, but nothing about that means they will have a better record than the Knicks in the regular season. Knicks improved their team and the Hawks stayed pretty stagnant.   RJ could take a leap, Randle could build on last season and get even better, Mitch could be healthy all season...some people are acting like theyknow the future..."
Disrespect to Elfrid Payton
Elfrid payton
"love this. been a fan of his since uconn, love a hometown kid and wanted him before he went to boston. best fucking part about this? hes not elfrid fucking payton!"
No elfrid payton is what makes me hardest.  Certified boner killer.
"right before the whistle blows for game 1, kemba and d rose rip off their masks and it’s elfrid payton and frank ntilikina."
"We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba walker for 8 million. And that is bad, how? You sound salty."
"The disrespect to Elfrid ""Point God of the East"" Payton!"
" &gt;the difference between Elfrid Payton and washed Kemba is still a pretty massive net gain for the Knicks  On some nights. On other nights Payton will be much better than Kemba. Overall it might be a small gain. If his knee is hurting for a playoff series, that's probably the end of your season."
"We were starting Elfrid Payton at point and E’twaun Moore at SF. Our best SF was Solomon Hill. Omar Asik, Tim Frazier, Dante Cunningham, Darius Miller started for us at various points. Are there any Bucks starters worse?"
Get a guy who can run an offense to replace Elfrid Payton as a starter
"Knicks were a top 2-3 defensive team last season and the 4 seed. We took the same roster and traded Elfrid Payton, Frank Ntilikina, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker. I'm not sure where your logic is?"
You want one elfrid payton?
"Post ASB last year he was good. Also he doesn’t have to be an allstar, he just has to be not elfrid Payton."
"When healthy doesn’t really matter on one year deals I guess is my point. The worst case is it doesn’t work out and it costs the Knicks 0 assets to do this. It’s all about process, sometimes the process works, sometimes it doesn’t. As long as the decision making is sound I can’t complain. And again, he could be on one leg and would still be a massive upgrade over elfrid Payton."
"Man, we had elfrid Payton playing point last year. Even if it doesn’t work out It’s a low risk high reward signing. Hobbled Kemba is still significantly better than Payton."
"We replaced Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. I think it’s safe to say we have gotten significantly better while keeping our chemistry from last season. Will we finish higher than the 4th seed? I don’t know, but we will be a better team than last year."
"This isnt true at all...The knicks biggest issue was Elfrid Payton, and consistent scoring, and they replaced Elf with Kemba Walker, and added Fournier, and have one of the better defensive centers in the league coming back from injury. They were one basket from being up 2-0 to Atlanta, but instead folded. They got alot better. It wont get them up to the bucks, nets, sixers level, but they will be alot more ready come playoffs."
Elfrid Payton is available
I hear Elfrid Payton is available
Tbh I think on paper we are MUCH better but the rest of the East improved too. But objectively speaking the gap between Elfrid Payton and Kemba Walker is MASSIVE.
"How are the moves not good? their biggest weakness in the playoffs was Elfrid Payton getting minutes and scoring, and they added Kemba Walker and Fournier, and have one of the better defensive centers in the league coming back from injury..all the contracts are very reasonable, and able to be traded if needed."
"it wasn't even just Jules playing poorly in the playoffs. we didn't have shot creators or playmakers outside of him. we addressed both of those issues this offseason by adding shooters and guys who can create shots off the dribble. Rose was the only other guy on our roster who could penetrate in the playoffs. We pretty much swapped out Reggie for Fournier and Elfrid fuckin payton for Kemba. Plus hopefully an improved RJ, IQ and Obi. I think we definitely improved this offseason and addressed issues. The question becomes how much better does it make us and what other teams drastically improved this offseason in the east. I still think we're probably a first round exit or maybe we sneak into the 2nd but it seems like progress while still keeping our picks and young guys."
This just means no more or at least less Elfrid Payton. Which is always a fucking plus
Don't care + you just traded for Al Horford from the same team + any 5'10 dude is a better PG than Elfrid Payton
Keep telling yourself that lol. Signed him for less than the MLE to replace Elfrid fucking Payton. Huge W.
"You want a good Kemba, but you need the bad Elfrid Payton"
"Also, even if he is diminished, the difference between Elfrid Payton and washed Kemba is still a pretty massive net gain for the Knicks, especially since they're not gonna be paying him like $28mil or whatever he was making."
"We know what we’re getting, which is an upgrade over Elfrid Payton."
"he is replacing Elfrid Payton. As long as the money isn't terrible, we won't be disappointed."
"I know people will criticize this move considering Kemba's injury history, but I will take an injured Kemba Walker over Elfrid Payton anyday of the week."
Well he’s not Elfrid Payton so yes
Dennis to his agent: At least we have China right?  *a few moments later*  Woj: Shanghai Sharks sign Elfrid Payton to 3-year deal
Amazing to think that's what we were paying Elfrid Payton 2 years ago
That’s Elfrid “Johnny bravo” Payton to you
Back 1/3? Elfrid Payton is back 1/3. Dlo is not that
"I'd take Langston over IT in a heartbeat - a true professional, no drama. Monty couldn't use him much last year because he had to develop Ty-Shon Alexander, who in the end got waived. I'd still prefer Galloway over  Elfrid ""the shoe"" Payton."
"the wrong personel moves, those matter and shape your career. So yes, Stan Van Gundy was the wrong hire for a young up and coming team. It would make more sense to get someoen to let them loose offensively, take advantage of the youth and atheticism, let them flourish offensively and then when they are ready to take that 1-4 seed step get a vet with those defensive principles.  then the lonzo situation.  Zion has gone a long way to praise lonzo and htey compliment each other perfectly. Lonzo is amazing in the transition, always looking to push the ball, perfect lob or p/r option for zion and then he fits zion as a playmaker as he can play the 3/d role, they just let him go, got another un proven rookie and a vet who has seen his best days behind him for jrue holiday.    they've jumbled up the surrounding him the right way and then in temrs of player health thats always a debate and a battle.  do i think zion is acting too soon? Sure, but pelicans have not done a good job of showin they are an organization that will build a winner for his unique talent opportunity.   so how can he show this? Not sign the extension, ti will cost him a good amount of money to take the qualifying offer nad then go on his way, if he chooses this route then its better for pelicans to get something rather than nothing.  Griffin was supposed to be a new culture and he was promising, but if you read the article the rest of the staff are not sold on his ways either.  they did this beforer him with AD and rondo too. they finally had playoff success, Rondo and AD sung praises of playing together and rondo even said hed look at a discount to stay and run it back but they never called him, replaed him with elfrid payton bc they looked at a box score or something and that was the final nail in the coffin for AD.    These guys careers are done in a flash, before you know it, and they are judged by wins in a team sport.  so the sense of urgency is there bc the status quo is changing."
"i think his percentages will hold or go up, but his ppg will stay the same because of a lot more options on the knicks offense. fournier and kemba are a lot better than elfrid payton and reggie bullock."
someone needs to make a version of this with all the budgets and stuff. don't think i've seen one before. i might do it when i have time. Elfrid Payton would be really expensive
If this was last year I would've vouched Elfrid Payton in a second.
embiid tatum and elfrid payton for the win
"FO really chose Fournier over Oladipo because they wanted better shooting next to Elfrid Payton and Aaron Gordon… we also gave up on Tobias Harris. With Oladipo, Harris and Vuc we could’ve had a decent team that would atleast be fun to watch"
the knicks have the literal top coach and upgraded starting PG from elfrid payton to kemba walker. the only way the pacers finish ahead of them is if the pacers are significantly healthier than the knicks.
And Elfrid Payton
The elfrid Payton 10/10/10
“Nba stars” includes Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton
"John Wall is a star? I guess given the lakers flair they still have the mentality of 2015 or something.  John Wall and his spacing would hurt the sixers, I'd easily take a beverly/beasly or really any other mediocre package over Wall who is a negative asset at this point given his lebron money and Elfrid Payton output"
But he's still better than Elfrid Payton
I disagree.   No team is going to trade for a guy sitting on the bench with the upside of elfrid payton output.
"nope, Wall sat out 2 entire years, since then still barely plays half the games.  The chances are if he plays and continues to have tweak injuries as he has been, his value will be even less dependable.  I could see this in someone hoping that he may get healthy and go for it. Namely the clippers who have a few bad contracts to trade and need to get better if Leonard plays in the playoffs.    A few more teams will come at trade deadline or next off seson, but WAll is still getting Lebron Money with Elfrid Payton output, that ain't gonna fly."
"Yep, Rockets said they had a few first rounders last year for oladipo. Coincidentally they leaked that throw Woj and didn't come close to pannign out, now it seems they've lost their contact with Woj after that one.  Wall is one of the least tradeable contracts in the league. hes getting lebron james money with Elfrid Payton output and Grant Hill Injuries."
"You are right, I lazily worded it.   My point was that with predictive models, human decision ultimately impacts what corrections for “wrongness” we implement. A lot of it is backed in mathematical theory that is well-tested but ultimately it is a decision that lies in a fallible human’s hands.  If I want to decide which predictive variables to include in a model, depending on which method I use, it will possibly result in a different mix of variables. The differing mix will ultimately impact my predicted outcome. Pair that with the fact that predictions aren’t meant to exactly produce the final, actual result and you can have anything from a near spot-on prediction to something as bad as thinking Elfrid Payton would be a decent basketball player"
Blake had a midrange shot though.  Elfrid Payton had no jumper whatsoever and no free throw shooting lol.
"Dunk machines like Blake age poorly, as do players who miss a lot of time, so I don't think they are crazy for having BG in the mid-teens.  Blake went on to sit the majority of games over the next six seasons, the time frame projected here.  Embiid hadn't played an NBA game.  Giannis was coming off a rookie season where he averaged 7/4.  Payton was young and this is the type of shit that happens when you rely entirely on data, as this list did.  They admit that this may be a huge overranking, adding  &gt; So we have bona fide stars like Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin … and then we have Elfrid Payton?!? Is this CARMELO’s version of PECOTA’s infamous Wily Mo Pena projection? Time will tell, but Payton logged almost 2,500 minutes as a 20-year-old rookie last year while flashing excellent passing and defensive skills.   I'm just glad they provide us with some public player projection data, while I have to admit it's far from perfect it's the only gig in town so take it or leave it."
we’re talking about Elfrid Payton though
"That isn’t just the Carmelo metric. They added some other stuff to it and tinkered and the article is actually supposed to be a projection of who might be the better player over *the next six years* from when the article was posted. So no, they didn’t say that Elfrid Payton was more valuable than prime Blake Griffin. They just projected him to be the better player over the next six years.  Still a terrible projection in hindsight tho, but if you actually read it they don’t seem to be very confident in the projection for Elfrid either. They say if he developed a shot, maybe that could be true. And if he didnt then he would be worse than ricky rubio"
"[Yup, I found it.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-53-best-franchise-players-in-the-nba/)  According to their ""CARMELO"" system, in 2015, Elfrid Payton was the 14th best player in the NBA. Blake Griffin was #15."
Didn't these guys invent a metric that said Elfrid Payton was more valuable than Prime Blake Griffin?
"this exactly, peoople cite rare anomoalies of loyalty in dirk or kobe, heck kobe even demanded a trade out. Fact is its a relationship and you need the organization and team to support you, then they need you to committ and perform and magic happens.  It was laughable to see people get on AD(even if he handled it wrong) bc he was ready to commit, literally on their best showing he began to sign praises on Rondo making the difference and Rondo said he was ready to even think of a discount, but no call came...pelicans went with Elfrid Payton bc yo know..box score stats are close enough  Furthermore with Harden(handled it wrong himself) but he watch a team he carried and got one game from the finals and a new owner came, lied to everyone abotu being a big shot and going all in for the win, and proceeded to cheap out on role players, staff, and 'non headlining' moves and made his job harder and then all of a sudden people called him disloyal for leaving as if hes supposed to break his back to make 100s of millions for this owner who is making his job and short time in his prime much harder while the rest of the league is just spending more, kobe learned, even lebron learned...  Espn will never learn."
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
"half eaten bag of frito pie, elfrid payton and cash considerations"
Anybody to ever exist &gt; Elfrid Payton
Nvm bro replace Kawhi and Lowry with Curry and Elfrid Payton and while we're at it replace Siakam with Kwame Brown then Curry ain't winning shit 💯
Elfrid Payton
"While I agree I do wonder if maybe there's a sense of necessity/urgency as far as getting *something* good/great back for him just because outside of Embiid nothing has worked out for the Sixers.  1st rd picks going back to 2014 when they drafted Embiid:  2014 - Embiid, Elfrid Payton.  Embiid obviously a centerpiece, but Payton was never all that special and still isn't today.  2015 - Jahlil Okafor -  Do I really need say anything?  Wasted 3rd pick.  2016 - Simmons, TLC, Korkmaz.  Simmons has been a disappointment, soon to be traded.  Wasted 1st pick possibly, depends on if they get extremely lucky with a trade. TLC is an ok bench player in limited stretches but nothing special, same for Korkmaz  2017 - Fultz - Had the yips, got traded, is halfway decent now.  Not great, not terribly special, but just ""ok"".  Wasted 1st pick.  2018 - Bridges and Shamet.  Bridges immediately traded for rights to Zhaire Smith (who has played like 13 games total in 2 yrs for Philly).  Shamet was solid, but he's gone too.  2019 - Ty Jerome whose rights were traded for Matisse ""Career avgs of 4.3/1.8/1.1"" Thybulle.    2020 - Tyrese Maxey.  Solid young player with lots of potential, but he's got a ways to go.  Oh and don't forget that after 2018/19 they lost Jimmy Butler.  I wouldn't be surprised if they feel like the last 7 years of moves has left them with nothing to show for it other than Embiid and now they feel pressure to get something ""good"" for Simmons, otherwise they just keep wasting FRP's for nothing.  I mean, this is the type of performance the avg GM would be on the hot seat for...a bunch of lottery picks that turned out to be one superstar who likely won't be dominant for long thanks to injury-history and a bunch of flameouts who ended up getting traded for Dorito-crumbs and bench players."
"If I’m the 76ers I actively don’t trade him and financially penalize him until he shows up. After that I’d trade him. I realize that has possible ramifications on the success of the team this season, possibly four seasons of Ben just didn’t come for the entire contract, but I do get tired of players with nearly a max length contract demanding trades, this one especially because he’s simply got his feelings hurt that Doc said he isn’t sure Ben can be the point guard of a championship team. Doesn’t mean he couldn’t be any other position on a championship team. But for now, as a PG, he’s just a taller Elfrid Payton."
"Our Defense. Replacing Elfrid Payton, and a Reggie Bullock with Kemba and Fournier are certainly upgrades but it makes men worry about how our perimeter defense will be. Last year Reggie Bullock was our primary wing defender and now RJ is gonna have to step into that role."
That’s the time AD also gave up on us anyways. Elfrid Payton was our starting point guard
This just reminded me how bad Elfrid Payton has always been. Especially on defense.
"Banking on an injury as a reason for why you’re correct is completely farcical, especially when randle has no chronic injury concerns. After having a great regular season you’re going to completely discount his achievements due to his performance in his first playoff series? He made 2nd team all NBA and the 4th seed with elfrid payton as his starting point guard. He has more talent around him now and more consistent play from the young guys, I truly don’t see the Knicks completely missing the playoffs. If anything the Miami Heat would be more probably to have injury problems with 36 year old Kyle Lowry."
Elfrid Payton
"he was athletic without a jumpshot then the athleticism waned and he never got a reliable jumpshot  can't defend, can't shoot, barely can attack the rim.   he couldn't outplay elfrid payton and that's a low ass bar"
He was solid for us last year in the little time we were able to carve out for him.  We got lucky with few injuries over the year so he didnt get much run but when he did he looked good.  Most Suns fans wanted to keep him over bringing back Elfrid Payton but with the addition of Shamet theres even less guard minutes to go around next season and honestly not sure if he wanted to come back into that role.
"&gt; It’s only now after they failed you’re calling them bad.  many people in our sub were calling out the tobias trade when it happened. most of us were fooled with the horford signing.  &gt;Same thing once Doc got fired from the clippers y’all were thirsty as fuck  this is a blanket statement. many many many fans were against the rivers signing. including myself.  Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."
"Fox is better?? No one has been more disrespected after averaging 27 ppg on 50/40/90 and 27 ppg in the finals (including the series winner) than kyrie lmao.  The difference between their rim finishing (which kyrie isn't even that bad at, fox is just insane at it) is made up for the fact that kyrie is an infinitely better shooter at every distance and from the line. Fox is a westbrook level shooter while kyrie is one of the best 3p shooters in the league.  If you could go back in time and give the dac FO the option of drafting either kyrie or fox fox would be at the airport before you finished your sentence. Well actually knowing the kings they'd draft elfrid Payton or something but the point stands"
"For sure and tickets will be cheap! I remember enjoying games in 16/17 and 17/18 where our ‘young core’ was Aaron gordon, Mario hezonja, and Elfrid payton and loving it lol. I have a feeling this group will deliver a bit more than the last."
The Elfrid Payton era
RJ Barrett... look at how he played year 1 and the jump he made in year 2. He had Elfrid Payton as his starting point guard both seasons who seemed to be allergic to giving him the ball. A much better starting point guard and an improved surrounding cast should push him to the next level.
Literally just the Hawks/Knicks first round series:  * Elfrid Payton * Julius Randle * Solomon Hill * Tony Snell * RJ Barrett  Even in the Lakers series how you coming away thinking you'd rather have Frank Kaminsky on your team.
"Literally just in the games the Hawks played there were worse. In terms of players who were worse than expected, Julius Randle took 19 shots a game on &lt;30% from the field over the series. In terms of players who were supposed to have starting roles but were extremely bad, there was Elfrid Payton. If you're just talking about overall not-goodness, then there's the fleet of garbage time players or even just Solomon Hill. How do you actually watch games and think Andre Drummond was the worst player in the playoffs?"
"Elfrid Payton, Rajon Rondo, Ben Simmons"
our starting PG was Elfrid Payton that should say enough lol. We were bottom 5 in scoring last year. We started 3 players last year who are best bench players. You guys had 4 players average over 19ppg we had 1. We were good because we played defense but if you go position for position down our roster you guys have more talent than us lat year by far.
"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he’s a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he’d be an awful fit. Though I’m not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he’s a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ’ for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he’s a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon’s a different story in my opinion. And I’m not even all that high on him but I think he’d work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there’s a fair few other guys I’d say the same about even if they’re not as good players in a vacuum."
Yeah I agree. I think people (based on my downvotes above lol) are really sleeping on how much better even post-prime Kemba is than Elfrid Payton was last year. Fournier is a major upgrade offensively over Bullock and Thibs should still be able to coax a good enough defense out of this group with Mitch and Noel as the rim protectors.   Also the Knicks bench that they're bringing back in full was one of the best bench units in the league last year and the younger guys showed out well in summer league... Overall I'm pretty high on this group but the East did get better so it will be interesting to see where they shake out in the standings
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
"A bit biased here but I think the Knicks depth and bench is much stronger than Bostons.  Also we'll see how Randle and Barrett adapt to having actual spacing around them and competent PG play.  Randle really closed the gap on Tatum last year as far as impact. We'll see how he can build off that.  Knicks were 24-11 when Rose played last year and they've upgraded the roster from that.  Assuming they're now going to get 48 minutes consistently of good pg play with Kemba/Rose/IQ, upgraded wing play in Fournier over Bullock, and closer to 82 games of Mitch/Noel at the C spot there's reason to believe that the Knicks are closer to the team that was at a 50 win pace with Rose playing than the mediocre version that gave Elfrid Payton starter minutes to begin the year..."
"Trey Burke, Hardaway Jr, Marcus Morris, Melo, Porzingis  For Pg the options are: Burke, Ntilikina, Dennis Smith, elfrid Payton, mudiay (?)"
"honnestly as much as what the hawks did was special it clearly also was due to VERY favorable circumstances  who was gonna abuse trae young? Elfrid fuckin payton or ben simmons, known for his offensive prowess?  i'd wait a bit for the victory laps on trae potential defensive liability not being an issue"
I can’t wait to get my Elfrid Payton jersey!
Someone just asked about Elfrid Payton too 😂
Elfrid Payton...
"Percent of 2P FGAs blocked (since 2000, min. 1000 2P FGA):  1. Reggie Evans, 17.7% 2. Omer Asik, 17.1% 3. Joe Harris, 14.4% 4. Joel Pryzbilla, 14.3% 5. Alonzo Gee, 13.9% 6. Kelly Oubre, 13.4% 7. Chuck Hayes, 13.4% 8. Bojan Bogdanovich, 13.3% 9. Bismack Biyombo, 13.3% 10. Elfrid Payton, 13.2%"
Shocked Elfrid Payton didn’t make this list
he looks like Elfrid Payton 2.0  not out of the league but a dude who won't be anything more than an average starter
"Yeah I think he’ll definitely be our second best player this year. He’s become an elite catch and shoot guy with his developed jumper which had added more versatility to his game outside of posting up a lot. He’s never really played with many good playmakers in his career, Elfrid Payton is probably the best I can remember and that was before Vuc’s 3 point shot had developed to what it is now"
"They represent both bojan and Bogdan Bogdanovic’s, capela, dieng, sekou, Bjelica,Sabonis, Rui, poku, both Morris twins,Elfrid Payton etc etc and until today... James harden  I think they are doing okay"
* Aaron Gordon * Mario Hezonja * Victor Oladipo * Elfrid Payton * Domantas Sabonis  The sample size and pattern here cannot be ignored.
"Except that’s not the case.  Most players were bad or did nothing before Orlando.  Tobias Harris before he got here wasn’t much.  Vuc became an All Star in Orlando.  Fournier became a starter.  AG became a great defensive player.  Markelle Fultz became an actual player.  Cole Anthony has I,proved in year 2.  Mo Bamba finally has developed this year.  Wendell Carter has been way better in Orlando than he ever was in Chicago.  Going further back than that.  Hedo Turkoglu in Orlando finally broke out. T-Mac became a superstar.  Really only Oladipo and Elfrid Payton are the only players I can think who didn’t work out in Orlando and in Oladipo’s case he was traded too early.  So you’re kinda speaking out your ass here."
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."
His stats might take a dip from sharing the ball with Kemba and Fournier but RJ Barrett took off his Rock Lee ankle weights in the shape of Elfrid Payton and now has infinite space. He was also already the best perimeter defender on one of the best defensive teams in the league. He won't be flashy enough to be on any MIP ballots but his season is going to be so exciting to watch.
get mad before you start losing in embarrassing fashion. It's a punk move. I was so pissed when Elfrid Payton pushed someone (i think Jae Crowder?) when the knicks were getting blown out 2 years ago. Or during the playoffs when Reggie Bullock was trying to do that fake tough guy shit in game 5. Trae weighs 78 pounds and he whooped your ass for 5 games straight after you talked shit. Man up on the basketball court or go into MMA if you wanna do that tough guy shit.
Elfrid Payton I feel like
"I’ve always disagreed with the “you aren’t a professional basketball analyst/coach so you can’t have a take on the game or it’s players” school of thought. Why tf not, you know. For example, when thibs plays Elfrid payton 25 minutes a game most Knicks fans understood werent smarter than him, but they were also absolutely right to criticize the decision. In my mind being a fan gives you the license to have opinions on what’s happening."
"He's taking the minutes Elfrid Payton played last year, so any performance is an upgrade."
Elfrid Payton is a good PG.   I died on this hill.
Kemba's gonna have his bad moments/games but the different between having him and Elfrid Payton is comical.
D-griff probably trying to trade our whole roster for Elfrid Payton as we speak. *Sigh.*
*Elfrid Payton has entered the chat*
Or Elfrid Payton
"Elfrid Payton putting up almost twice as many shots as the teams ""star"" center lol"
Elfrid Payton is on an NBA team I am disgusted. Wow.
kemba is still much better than elfrid payton was. seems like you kemba haters always want to conveniently ignore the walking trash can we had starting before. not to mention the 2 promising guards we just drafted. kemba is just fine right where he is.
"The Knicks already had a max cap spot. That’s enough for Morris and Randle as is. So the cap you cleared from the trade turned into Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Elfrid payton and co.   Your last point has nothing to do with the trade either. I don’t care about your hypotheticals, especially since you clearly have some bias towards the Knicks. The fact of the matter is KP and hardaway played large offensive roles in one of the leagues best offences. And as much as I love Luka, it wasn’t even close to a carry job on his part at least in the regular season. The team proved more than capable with him benched and injured   And the reason for KP’s ejection is irrelevant. The fact is as a result of the trade the Mavs have been a highly competitive mid tier playoff team."
"Bro if you think going from Elfrid Payton to Kemba is a net negative, then there’s something wrong with you"
yeah but elfrid payton is a straight bum lol
"I don't really know what to say to this  Knicks have our own set of problems for sure but we made a bunch of steps to address them in the offseason, shipping out elfrid payton, bringing in kemba and fournier, getting rid of frank  we aren't under the same kind of pressure as the mavericks though.   you seem like you don't want to acknowledge the issues here and that's fine because there's ultimately nothing you can do about it except watch.   it's just gonna be another frustrating season where luka has to do everything and you get bounced out of the playoffs early because the roster is really weak compared to the other playoff teams in the west  we are trying to improve as a team, mavericks seem to content to let it ride with the same group with the same issues and pray luka can carry you"
"The cap space you already have was enough for Randle and Morris. So the cap space you acquired from the trade went to Elfrid payton and Bobby Portis and Wayne Ellington. So was that worth it? No. The picks could be but they haven’t conveyed yet. To be worth it those two picks, likely in the 20-30 range will have to be as good or better than the players lost in KP and THJ.  And saying Randle is a top 20 player is a stretch to everybody that’s not a Knicks fan. All NBA doesn’t determine where a player ranks, it’s influenced by record, injuries and other basketball politics factors. By that logic Deandre Jordan and Ben Simmons and the like were top 15 players when they got the nods"
Not when they had a max spot in the first place that would’ve allowed them to sign Randle and Morris who became quickly. So basically the cap they freed up from the trade got them Bobby Portis Elfrid payton and Wayne Ellington
"&gt; whatever ""cap space"" was cleared so they could sign Bobby Portis and Elfrid Payton along with Julius Randle isnt actually part of the trade  It is tho"
"Do people really think the Knicks won the trade, nobody won lol, and whatever ""cap space"" was cleared so they could sign Bobby Portis and Elfrid Payton along with Julius Randle isnt actually part of the trade it's just a rationalization people make up to feel better about their team and the move"
Crazy how much better Obi looks with a real preseason and without having to play with Elfrid Payton.
"Is Jaylen Brown the devil? That dude could NOT miss until the end of the game when he has 0 energy left.    Mitch was a beast, but there were points last night where I was really missing Noel. Mitch is gonna need a few weeks to get his conditioning right while letting all of that muscle he added stick. With Gibson out, we did get a nice run of the Obi/Randle frontcourt, which found great success. I do think in a game like this Noel would have been very helpful.   Celtics fans were right about Kemba's defense, but I didn't expect to get so frustrated with having a guard so small get blocked constantly. Our backups are very good, so it's not too bad. I just have to keep telling myself that as long as he's not Elfrid Payton, we stay winning."
"I mean, Elfrid Payton started over Rose all year despite being Elfrid Payton.  I think that Kemba will be the starter but as the year goes on, Rose will take control of the ""closer"" role."
"true, but Oubre was terrible by a lot of advanced metrics too. -3.8 ORAPTOR is bottom 10 in the league among players with 1000 minutes. -1.5 OBPM is 31st to the bottom. EPM has him at a -2.2, just under Ish Smith and Elfrid Payton. Wiggins is roughly a net zero by most of those stats, which is about what I expected. I would love to know where you're getting your data btw, I can't find any way to exclude minutes shared with certain players without doing math."
"This will not happen and i'll tell you why.   Elfrid Payton started every game he played last season while Rose consistently out played him. However we were winning games and Rose went on to finish games in the fourth so who cared right?  This season now we have 2 point guards that can each finish games depending on who is playing well. Walker played the entire first OT, so it made sense Rose played the second."
"Man the fucking Knicks just had so much extra that they didn’t have last season.  Kemba ain’t what he used to be, but he’s still an upgrade over Elfrid Payton.  Fournier is definitely a welcomed second ball handler and shot maker.  Obi really growing into his 6th-7th man role  Mitch fucking Robinson  Oh and our old faithfuls Julius Randle and Derrick fucking Rose.   Can I get a Yeerrrrr"
Rose was also better than Elfrid Payton last year and played off the bench. Just the way Thibs runs things for whatever reason
"At the start of 18-19, the Pelicans best 5 man lineup was Elfrid Payton, Jrue, AD, Mirotic, and Randle."
Controversial opinion but I think Kemba is better than Elfrid Payton
"&gt; James Jones likes high BBIQ, high motor guys   The first FA he signed was Jamal Crawford. Crawford was fun to watch, but he was the exact opposite of high BBIQ, and his motor only turned on when he had the ball.   His next big move after that was to trade for Kelly Oubre - another guy not known for his high BBIQ or motor.   Then he sold TJ Warren to Indy. Warren may not be the highest BBIQ player around, but he's smarter than Cash Considerations.   Here's his GM record, it's not exactly filled with the type of guys you're describing.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/executives/jonesja99x.html  It's basically Rubio, who was then traded for CP3, and then re-signing CP3. Maybe Crowder too, although he can't dribble or pass.   Cheick Diallo, Frank Kaminsky, Langston Galloway, Etwaun Moore, Cam Payne, Elfrid Payton - I mean, they're all NBA-caliber guys but I wouldn't say any of them are known for their high BBIQ or motors.   Granted, CP3 is top 2 in the entire league in BBIQ (Lebron), so the other guys don't have to be."
"i mean we were able to get Kemba for basically 8M/yr to basically not be Elfrid Payton and I would rather give the extension offer to someone already on the team in RJ Barrett, which should hopefully happen by the end of the season"
"There also haven't been any preseason games since Friday, and there is still one more day before there will be any regular season games.  I don't know what else there would be to talk about.  I mean, from the perspective of my own team, we could talk about how the transition from an Elfrid Payton/Reggie Bullock to Kemba Walker/Evan Fournier backcourt should change the Knicks offense but opens up concerns for what it will do for their defense - but we've already talked about that ad nauseum since Walker agreed to sign in July.  We're focused on the drama right now because that's what is going on and there are literally no Xs and Os to focus on."
"yes we subtracted elfrid payton and reggie bullock, Id say we are in good shape for the coming season and teams success is largely dependent on how well rj plays this season."
"trust me when i say that the ball wasnt even in rj's hands last season either with elfrid payton on the team yet he still managed to go 17.6. look at a guy like tatum who stats jumped the same time prime kemba off his best season with the hornets came to the team, and fournier who was literally on the celtics last year. + if we dont pay rj hes a team like toronto gonna give him that money."
We’re gonna have the best bench in the league.   CP3/cam Payne/Elfrid Payton   Booker/shamet  Mikal bridges/cam Johnson  Jae crowder / cam Johnson /jalen smith  Ayton / jevale McGee / Frank kaminsky
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
I strongly disagree with this. The Knicks biggest issues in rj’s first 2 years have been a lack of spacing and players capable of any type of creation. Kemba and Fournier will bring both and if preseason was any indication there will be plenty of touches for rj. Also people who didn’t watch the Knicks a lot last year don’t understand that elfrid Payton would consistently freeze out Rj and take touches away from him

Worst: I was sure Elfrid Payton was Dame Lillard + elite rebounding. I also thought Thon Maker was what zion is.  Best: I've been right about every magic draftee sucking for like 5 years straight.
"a little bit?  he played 24min and was -25!  the only suns players who played 24min were cam payne (who started but isn't a starter) and elfrid payton, everyone else was 18min or less. 😢  when dame left the game halfway through Q3 the score was 50-79! 😭"
If Elfrid Payton was 6 inches taller and a generational passer

"I think the hawks game planned for him and forced everyone else to create which they can’t really do. Our offense revolves around Randle because he had the ball in his hands a lot of the time. The only other PG/distributor was elfrid Payton (lol) and rose. Rose was phenomenal but can’t do it by himself. I don’t know if they’d be able to do that again this year. Walker (barring injuries) would alleviate that as he is the main shot creator, Randle can create and so can Fournier. Don’t forget we were also missing Robinson who is our best and starting center, so capela was able to feast in the PNR with young. The addition of healthy Robinson, Fournier and kemba will help to relieve that pressure of Randle in a playoff situation and teams won’t be able to game plan for just Randle only."

"And Elfrid Payton, a 6'4"" defensive specialist point guard ... named Payton ... is not one of his sons."
Or Elfrid Payton
"Steph, Dame, George Hill, Elfrid Payton, and McCollum were all 3 stars or worse."
Kyrie for Elfrid Payton makes sense
"Ok, TJ McConnell.... his rookie year he had more assists and less turnovers per 100 possessions than LaMelo.   If you discount per 100 possessions, and prefer just totals per game balancing assists and turnovers:   Damian Lillard  Elfrid Payton  Ricky Rubio  Ben Simmons Trey Young  Lonzo Ball MCW   So not a ton, but certainly not groundbreaking/generational"
"They replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with someone who attempted even more 3s per game than he did last year, believe it"
And they’re all forgetting about the biggest addition = the subtraction of Elfrid Payton
"I think a lot of Knicks fans might find that the idea of Kemba on your team is currently better than the reality. Elfrid Payton was pretty garbage so it's still an upgrade, but Kemba is also lacking in the best ability - availability. I'd bet the house that he doesn't play over 70 games."
Elfrid Payton? That’s a weird one I wouldn’t put him top 5 at all
Bol Bol Reggie Jackson Kevin Looney Elfrid Payton Tony Snell
Kemba could play 50 games this season and still be a clear net positive from Elfrid Payton
"Definitely is a net positive over Elfrid Payton, but agree that it’s unlikely he’ll be Charlotte Kemba.   Health will be the biggest factor on how much of an impact he makes."
the hype around kemba is that he is not elfrid payton.
"when it comes to ineptitude, the answer is elfrid payton"
We were a much better team than you last year. We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier. You replaced Kyle Lowry with Goran Dragic.
"exactly, this is the 2nd time the pelicans will lose their star bc of their decision making.  First was building around AD.  Their very best year with rondo in the playoffs he was raving about the difference it made playing with rondo and wanting to run it back.  Rondo himself said loved the feel of playing in that team and was even considering giving them a discount or edge, he said they never called. They signed Elfrid PAyton as the replacement because the ...box score?   Now zion, they are gifted another elite player and they are just doing terrible at building around him.  Lonzo was almos a perfect compliment bc he can switch to a 3/d for zion the playmaker, and then he can push the transition at anypoint to get it to zion the flyer.    Then they dropped the ball on the coach. SVG bringing in a detailed neurotic defensive coach for a bunch of young players made no sense. First they should've unleashed their youth and athleticism with a run n gun coach like MDA, then when their ready to take htatn ext step and go deeper in the playofs then you can get SVG.    Only question is will zion really not sign the obvious first extension and wait the usual 7 years or will he just not want to waste time and take a one year loss o money"
"I mean I think that comes down to not knowing about the players. Huerter this season was 12 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds on 43% FG/36% 3P/ 78% FT.   RJ Barrett was 18 points, 3 assists, 6 rebounds on 44% FG/ 40% 3P/ 75% FT.   RJ did this with Elfrid Payton his starting point guard not passing him the ball, while Huerter played with Trae Young."
"After watching him play in summer league, wasn't impressed whatsoever, reminds me of a slightly higher ceiling elfrid payton"
"This is pretty wild      The 10th overall pick from those years for comparison     CJ McCollum, Elfrid Payton, Thon Maker, Zach Collins, Justise Winslow, Mikal Bridges.     I would take team 27th in a heartbeat.    What's wilder is that I had to go all the way down to the 5th overall pick to find a group I would take above them (Trae+Fox), which even then is less consistent overall."
"“new york knickerbockers I don't see why they got kemba 6 guards on the team will probably lead to them all taking away from each other to an extent”  hard to find a collection of words dumber than this. who played point last year? it was elfrid payton and d rose. payton is out, kemba is in. immanuel quickley is a 2 guard who can play some point, and deuce mcbride is a rookie PG who will need time to adjust to the nba."
"&gt; And getting Saric and Noel for Jrue Holiday was not a great use of the assets Hinkie inherited.  They got Noel and Elfrid Payton. Payton got swapped for 3 picks(Saric, Shamet, Willy Hernangomez)"
Monty Williams was coaching a starting backcourt of Devin Booker and Chris Paul to the playoffs.  Tom Thibodeau was coaching a starting backcourt of RJ Barrett and fucking Elfrid Payton to the playoffs.  One of these things is very clearly not like the other. Give it a rest already.
"Your argument is entirely built on the false premise that his picks were consensus picks that every other GM would have made. You don't know that because you don't know what other teams draft boards looked like. Which are the consensus picks you claim he made? What makes KJ McDaniels, Nerlens Noel, MCW, Elfrid Payton consensus picks?  That's the flawed logic your argument is built on and the person replied that even if that was the case he should be drafting on what he thinks will bring the most value to his team not what the ringers mock draft say...case in point Ainge trading the first pick to take Tatum"
Elfrid Payton
"If you agree elaborate on your thoughts. What makes him worse than someone like Jarrett Culver, Dennis Smith Jr., or Elfrid Payton on offense? Be specific.   Alvin Robertson, Bruce Bowen, Andre Roberson, Tony Allen - all of these guys were TERRIBLE on offense, yet still played plenty of minutes because of their all league defense. You would think that the worst defensive team in the league could find a consistent spot in the rotation for an all league level defender, even if it was just 20 minutes a night.  I’m also still waiting for someone to actually SPEAK to his game. What does he do in particular on defense that makes him so good? What do you like about his on ball defense? His off ball defense? How does he handle switches? What does he do defensively in transition that stands out?   What in particular about his offense not only makes him bad, but the “worst offensive guard in the league”? It’s all fun and games until you ask people to actually provide descriptions of the players they want to make blanket statements about."
We saw a team with Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock as starters make the 4th seed. I don’t think 5th seed is their absolute cap and we should stop saying that so much
"Rondo is a fringe rotational player now. The only reason he’s in the league is cause of his high IQ. He’s not a scoring threat, his shooting has improved but he’s still super inconsistent and low volume so he doesn’t space the floor, at this point he’s a defensive liability. All he does is pass. Like Elfrid payton with worse defence.  THT can occasionally take guys off the dribble and play some decent defence. Nothing more. Lakers fans just hype him up cause he’s their only young player. He’s not good.   Bazemore is probably the worst defender in the league that qualifies for the “3 and D” label and he’s not some knockdown shooter. He was a low end rotation guy for a team that already had poor depth last year in GS.  Deandre Jordan couldn’t get minutes on a team starved at the C position. He’s completely washed. And ask any Philly fan and they’ll tell you the same thing about Dwight. He’s lost a lot of his mobility which means rather than the defender he was in LAL where he’d step up on pick and rolls and be a constant menace, he always plays in the drop coverage where he gets abused"
Knicks and Hawks over unders are baffling. Knicks replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba. They will win more than 41 games. Hawks are a 50+ win team when healthy so 47 just seems too low
"MPJ is more efficient largely because he plays next to one of the best creators in the league. RJ was playing next to Elfrid Payton as starting PG last year lmao.  RJ had to create for himself. But he’s 2 years younger and has time to grow. He needs to become more efficient that’s for sure, but he has a high ceiling. RJ is also a better defender."
Bismack Biyombo -&gt; Brandon Knight   Kemba -&gt; Jimmer   MKG -&gt; Beal   Jeff Taylor -&gt; Satoransky   Cody Zeller -&gt; Len   Vonleh -&gt; Elfrid Payton   PJ Hairston - Bogdan Bogdanovic   Frank the Tank -&gt; Winslow    This honestly winds up being just as bad lol
"They had Rose coming off the bench for Elfrid Payton last year, I don't think there was really much discussion who was going to start between him and Kemba."
"Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Marquese Chriss, Goga Bitadze."
Dude forgot about Elfrid Payton 🤭
"Ya I don’t get that, Book has been playing fantastic on both ends and is the best clutch player in the league this season. We ended up having to use Elfrid fuckin Payton because of that Book injury. Hopefully the national media doesn’t just talk about steph’s bad shooting and actually points out that Book was injured over half the game."
Best I can do is a few minutes of Elfrid Payton.
Yeah but the Suns are playing Elfrid Payton lol
Did Trae teach y’all nothing about Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton who do you think you are
BREAKING: Elfrid Payton is still trash
what a terrible pass by Elfrid Payton lmaoo
I was wondering why Elfrid Payton was out there then I remembered Book is out. 😪
Elfrid Payton minutes are a big no
"""Elfrid Payton was a great signing"""
Elfrid Payton still around the league?
"Why is Elfrid Payton playing? Cam Payne hurt, or Monty not pleased?"
how did elfrid payton play 63 games and kemba lasted 18
"What in my post history is offends you?  Things that I remember saying are that  \-cops often lie  \-immigrants are good for America  \-I prefer ranked-choice/Condorcet-inspired voting  \-people fail to consider the significant classism of anti-abortion laws  \-capitalism is bad  \-workers deserve more rights  \-bigotry is wrong  \-Elfrid Payton is not as bad as r/Knicks thinks  \-LeBron deserves more credit than r/nba gives him  \-imperialism is wrong  \-parents who disown their children for being gay/trans are bad people  &amp;#x200B;  Never have I said that I hate white people. I hate some people, based on their actions. Some of those people are white."
I mean any team would be hyped to upgrade elfrid Payton with kemba walker. Problem was we didn’t know how much he would suck lol
"Their starting rotation is statistically one of the worst in the league while being one of the most played, so something HAS to change. Kemba's whole contribution to the offense has been hitting threes, outside of that he does pretty much nothing. He doesn't seem to be quick enough anymore to beat people off the dribble and when he is able to get to the rim he gets seriously beat up and knocked around which I assume has to do with his lost quickness again.   Defensively he has been a mess, he gets a couple charge calls a game which is nice but the onball defense and rotations have not been there for him. He essentially was given the Elfrid Payton role before the benching where he starts the 1st and 3rd quarter then doesn't play again once subbed out. With Burks now starting, the bench will be Rose-Quickley-Grimes-Toppin-Noel so the minutes are no longer needed from Kemba when there are better fits on the bench."
"Two pg's I love, Ntilikina and Kemba, got/get less love from Thibs than Elfrid fucking Payton😭"
"Kemba's inability to contribute anything on offense from a role that requires offensive input is massive. We replaced Elfrid Payton with someone actually worse on both sides of the ball (and considerably so on defense).  When Randle has played without Kemba, he's been better. Not 2nd team All-Nba Randle, but better than without Kemba"
"I do recall that some Knicks fans were like ""oh man, Kemba is such a big upgrade over Elfrid Payton, thanks to the Celtics for salary dumping him so the buyout could happen"".  But we also all knew that he wasn't worth $35mil so I don't think anyone was like ""the Celtics fucked up by not keeping him at $35mil""."
Wait this guy was afraid to bench Elfrid Payton until his hand was forced in the playoffs.  And he’s benching Kemba completely.  Let Kemba work against the bench at least.
"LOL, guy was dealing with Elfrid Payton and now throws Kemba out after starting him every game? wtf is going on there?"
"Well he's not even a top 20 NBA player, why would anyone want to build a team around him?   I'm sure Elfrid Payton would be better if he was surrounded by guys that complement his playstyle but that doesn't mean you should move heaven and earth to make it happen"
Yeah I’m cool with that. You can send us Steph and Dray and we’ll send you Jalen Smith and Elfrid Payton. We’ll keep the team name Suns but you can refer to us as that name on Reddit.
He’s doing his best Elfrid Payton impersonation.
Elfrid Payton-Levels of terrible
"Yeah, but sometimes they are Elfrid Payton."
Used to be Elfrid Payton.
Last year would have been elfrid Payton. “Starting” for the playoffs Knicks to bring the third pg on the suns and getting dnps because he’s been so bad
"And Elfrid Payton ran off 5 straight triple doubles. But until I posted about it, nobody was noticing."
"just not for ariza? Ariza gt 15 million from the suns. 7 million over his current contract.  Rockets were a first time tax team.  Thats literally a lump sump of small change to ""run it back"" when your team is one game from the finals and your best two players call him the veteran leader who keeps the team together....  And if you are going to let that go, how about a replacement when you are in win now mode?   They didn't use the mid level, traded picks and assets to get under the tax, and signed minimum only to replace him and then even traded those(james ennis his replacement was traded for a 2nd rounder top 55 protected mid season while he was in the rotation...what excuse for that?)  Daniel house the dleague replacement was cut and let go for two months mid season.  In an age of load management when your star isn't resting and playing abovve and beyond and then you make his job harder? hes going to go where the market allows and an ownership who is willing to spend and support.  Let alone that tilman was quoted saying rockets have the worst practice facility in the league and he will update it..said that in 2017...never happened.  And arizas contract was a one year expriing..no future risk, EASILY TRADEable . He was traded...for Kelly oubre that very year . Then kelly wass traded with rubio for....Chris paul(another guy tilman leaked was a bad contract)  Funny how suns made the finals paying and risking on guys that we wouldn't.  So its about assets and keeping them.  We had a one year risk for ariza, no replacements in sight, and had flexiblity ot trade him if we wanted...we just said no for savings  our other moves(trading first picks, rotation players) all coincidentally led us to get under the tax each year.  Chris paul then was quoted saying the main thing we missed in 2019 was ariza, he kept hte glue going had harden and pauls respect.  but hes a non headliner and people don't get it. Just like Rondo iwth pelicans. Led them to their best year in playoffs, anthony davis san his praise and rondo wanted to run it back. they replaced him with Elfrid payton and if you are a box score guy you think they are the same, but thats where they miss it.  The mavs genius ofense was literally a brilliant luka just like harden dominating the ball...are you serious?  Silas is a great and well liked guy. that goes far when its more player driven and run than evr.  but I don't blame him, hell don't blame harden or the gm or coach wanting out of this mess bc the culture of the new ownership was save save save and run this like a mid tier restraunt where the new status quo of nets/clipperes is spend like crazy and thats why those terrible destinations are now drawing stars while people are running from a great place like houston bc of tilman.    Ask your self why jvg didnt entertain the rockets? Or any other star or coach who would've also demanded out bc the league is spending nad rockets are saving"
"it’s more of, the offense ran through him every possession last year and that’s when he was able to flourish. This year we have more playmakers on court (Kemba and fournier compared to elfrid payton and bullock) along with RJ’s progression and he’s having trouble adjusting to letting them have their share of running the offense at times as well with him being off-ball more times this year than last and it’s been a weird balance.   I think they’ll figure it out but they’re definitely still learning how to play with each other. It’s part of why our bench looks sm better bc it’s the same unit as last year so their chemistry is a million times higher"
"we traded away our secret ingredient, elfrid payton"
"Rob hennigan is the worst gm no one knows about. Gave biyombo a big contract, traded away 2 future all stars for a Ibaka rental and drafted Mario Hezonja and Elfrid payton with lottery picks."
Elfrid Payton would like a word with u
Elfrid Payton slander
"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
"In what world are Russ and Elfrid Payton on the same level? The Lakers went out and got a third star. They got him for what he does best. I didn’t like the trade then, and don’t like it now, but that’s besides the point.   Out of the three stars Russ is the one who can least adapt his game. He is who he is, for better or worse. If you’re going to bring in a player of his caliber you have to play up to his strengths, if not then what’s the point? Having Russ play off ball is like when mike D’antoni tried to have pau gasol be a spot up big."
Lmao imagine if you were coaching the Suns and told Monty Williams that he has to tailor the offense to Elfrid Payton to capitalise on his strengths. There is no point in crippling the team to make a mediocre player effective
"Ah yes, lonzo took off to 13-5-4.5  Those are prime Elfrid Payton numbers"
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
Yeah this rebuild is definitely a lot more watchable and fun. Last time I had to watch Arron Afflalo and Glen Davis be our best players. 4 years of convincing myself Elfrid Payton would figure it out.
Yeah he should do this.   Elfrid Payton should definitely do this too.
By that logic CP3 isn't a real PG because Phoenix also has Cam Payne and Elfrid Payton on the roster... Of cause they have backups and he might have problem in certain matchups. Doesn't change the fact that he often plays as center.   Also this wasn't about Dreymond but KD playing at 4. If Dreymond isn't a 5 and KD isn't a 4 who do you think played these positions when KD was with the warriors? Iggy and Klay?  Positions haven't been that rigid for years. Most good players  can play a position bigger or smaller.
elfrid payton did something good?
Does Elfrid Payton being the Magic franchise triple double leader count?
"I think the whole starting 5 is struggling to figure out how to play with each other. Randle was basically our only offensive option last year in the starting 5, everything started with and ran through him, and if it didn't it was Elfrid Payton getting stuffed at the rim. Now Barrett is good enough that you want him getting the ball, Kemba has replaced Payton and he's starting the offense more and looking for his shot off the dribble, and Fournier kind of needs the ball to be effective. When they get rolling it's beautiful, the ball moves and the defense panics because they can all do something with it and Robinson's just waiting for a lob in the dunker's spot. But otherwise it's stagnant and weird. Tonight was the first time I saw Thibs really embrace splitting up the bench mob and I think it helped, but in his defense the bench mob is literally the best 5-man lineup in the NBA so I'm not sure wtf he's supposed to do.   I'm hoping that the starting-5 starts to gel eventually, but Randle has to learn how to be an effective player when he's not a 1-man show on offense"
A bit better than Dubious Handles this season since he doesn't have Elfrid Payton on the team anymore to play Hot Potato
"lol...the best season they had with AD was with Rondo. He sung praises of the difference of having the vet in the playoffs in their success, rondo himself said he loved what they created and was even considering pelicans of a discount, but they never called.      Instead they went with Elfrid Payton...because his box score stats were close enough?    Didn't blame AD for not wassting away after 7 years of management not holding their end of the production while he was and and nba shelflife is short, they all realize  thats why I also predict Zion will be out and has lost trust in competent management.  You take this young fast team, and hten you gve them a veteran detailed defense coach like SVG and it was another misstep. You get them someone who will let them use their youth, athleticism ,energy to run n gun and cacuse trouble on that and then when they take the next step in the playoffs you get SVG.        Likewise with Lonzo, maybe not a better pg fit than him for zion who can smoothly move to a 3/d while zion the playmaker does his thing and guard 1-3 at a high level.  Otherwise he continues to move the ball in transition and creates easy complimetns to zion.  They let him go too with an option to match.  Redick, who has a top notch reputation as a pro, called griffin a liar and won't deal with him again.      In what idea was it professional For griffin to call out Gentry and publicly say ""I gave him all the answers to the test and he still failed"" Coaching is a small faternitiy, he continues to lose trust with players, coaches, and maybe even fans.  I was a big fan of his in cleveland, but he has jumbeled this up and fallen short too often, as they did before with AD.  In this era, players know they can't wast their time with bad ownership/managemetn and careers can pass you by.  Pelicans have managed terribly."
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
Celtics can have Elfrid Payton for cash considerations
"lol thanks, a lot of these Lakers are always fucking ridiculous with their NBA takes and like to shit on other teams/deflect criticism when things aren't going perfectly for the Lakers. Like in my opinion, the Suns have just about everything you need in highly-seeded playoff team, a PG that can run an offense and hit shots in the clutch (CP3), a true three level scorer (DBook), multiple wings and forwards who can play defense and stretch the defense on the offensive side of the ball (Mikal, Jae Crowder, Cameron Johnson, Saric), a good two way center (Ayton), and overall good depth in for Guards and Centers (Payne, Elfrid Payton, Javale, Frank the Tank). You can just tell this team has pieces and chemistry to make another deep run in the playoffs if their core guys are able to stay healthy when it matters most."
Who's the scapegoat now that there's no Elfrid Payton to blame. At some pt its impossible to ignore the gigantic gap in defensive performance with Mitch at the 5 vs Noel
Elfrid Payton I assume
"Ever since we got rid of Elfrid Payton...surprisingly no one. Feels pretty good for a change lol the closest I can think of is when Randle does that ISO heavy bullshit, but I feel like that's more of a Thibs desperation call than anything."
He’s not on the knicks anymore but I still have PTSD from watching Elfrid Payton dribble inside the paint for the whole possession just to miss a layup.
"as a knicks fan, honestly cannot say i really hate any of our guys this year, although that is subject to change. kemba might be a frontrunner if he doesn't get his shit together on defense.  i know this isn't exactly answering the question, but last year it was elfrid payton. thibs insisted on starting him every game of the regular season and the dude was just pathetic. honestly might've been the worst single season put together by a starter i have ever seen in my life. i could do an in depth analysis but if you watched nyk at all last year you know what i am talking about."
Lonzo really is an overpaid version of Elfrid Payton with hype
"Kobe would hate Elfrid Payton and Abdel Nader, mostly because they are black holes offensively. I feel like he might give Ayton a lot of grief during the expected Ayton slumps but he'd appreciate how often Ayton's in the gym and would be a great motivator for him too. Goes without saying he'd love Book and everyone loves Mikal."
Elfrid Payton for Cole Anthony who says no?
"You might wonder how I found myself in this predicament, it all started when somebody said ""Cole Anthony is worse than Elfrid Payton"""
Did it help Elfrid Payton or Lonnie Walker?
"Switch Westbrick with Jrue Holiday on the wizards last year and they would have made the second round at least.   Jrue, Trae, dame, unvaccinated Kyrie, Schroeder, D Fox, injured Klay, CP3, Elfrid Payton, Kyle Lowry, lonzo ball, lamelo ball, even Ben simmons are each &gt; Westbrick"
the disrespect to elfrid payton smh
you somehow made Frank and elfrid payton look like real threats from the outside
Where is Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock
"Orrr, look at Elfrid Payton.  PG is a much difficult position to shake bad habits from.  While Payton is still a very talented bench player, he at times held back the development of players on the Magic and was stat padding at times etc."
"Elfrid Payton isn't good at basketball and keeps playing  Devin Booker is just bad so far  Suns in general suck. So called shooters can't shoot, bench scorer Landry Shamet is struggling to average 5 points a game"
Elfrid Payton has a minimum speed requirement to activate.
That’s the Elfrid Payton I remember even if he didn’t get that last shot off in time.
"If that's all the Celtics need, Elfrid Payton would have to be a better value pickup. Payton loves to run and push the tempo. If he plays more like his 31 games in New Orleans and less like his time in New York, he could do wonders for them."
Surprised Elfrid Payton didn't make an appearance on this thread yet
"Eh, it's worse than that, we chose Elfrid Payton over Oladipo."
"Knicks fans were crying a lot last year when Obi was DNP, and had Elfrid Payton freezing RJ out nightly meanwhile Halliburton was looking great as a facilitator."
"The absolute worst thing about this sub might be the Westbrook discourse. No, he’s not some stat-padding fraud who’s a glorified Elfrid Payton. No, he’s not a top-5 point guard all-time. And you *don’t* need to have this conversation on every clip of a Westbrook dunk or a Westbrook assist. Nobody can ever just back the fuck off where the man is concerned."
"Yeah but what about the fact that RJ was better at every step of his career. People take things without looking at context as well. Scottie is definitely having a better start to his NBA career and just to be clear I’m not trying to shit on him. However, let’s take a look at some context around RJ’s NBA career thus far. Most top picks come into the NBA on a lottery team where they are given the keys as soon as they put the jersey on however the year RJ was drafted the Knicks had signed Julius Randle and gave him the keys instead. The Knicks head coach was a clown named David Fizdale who not only was a incompetent coach but a damaging player development coach. Fizdale and Co broke DSJ jumper and forced RJ to change his jumpshot (which he reverted back to last year and shot 40% from 3). The 2019 Knicks had some of the worse spacing of all time and for a rookie slasher you can see how this would cause some problems. So people look at his rookie season a bust but ignore the incompetence in the FO and coaching staff and the horrible roster construction filled with selfish veterans. Last year was great for NY but once again RJ faced similar issues with Elfrid Payton as the starting PG and a non offense factor big in Nerlans. The paint is packed again for a slasher but RJ made up for it by becoming an elite spot up shooter. Finally, we come to this year. This is the first time in RJ’s career that he has legitimate spacing in his career. He has started out slow and YET he is shooting 77% at the RIM! Meaning that for the first time a slasher has the ability to slash without multiple bodys in the paint and he is thriving. Yesterday was the fully fleshed out version of RJ. A elite scoring 2 way wing with the ability to play make at a high level. Literally the most valuable player you can have in the NBA. So all that to say I’m taking RJ."
why is elfrid payton still allowed on the basketball court
Doug McDermott  Jonathan Simmons  Elfrid Payton  Aaron Gordon  Mitch McGarry  Perry Jones
We were top 10 in 3P% last season with Reggie Bullock and Elfrid Payton as our starting guards. What makes you think these numbers aren’t sustainable when Kemba and Fournier are their replacements?
Fuck both Elfrid Payton and Mark Jackson
"I knew Elfrid Payton was good, but idk about HOF man..."
Elfrid Payton
I just realized that episode was from before the Knicks actually signed Elfrid Payton
Knicks had Elfrid Payton last year.  You sort of just get numb to it.
How am I supposed to know who Elfrid Payton is without the floppy hair?
Context matters he is on Philly playing next to 2 all star players in Simmons and Embiid. Coming to the knicks where are spacing is already trash and we have Elfrid Payton at PG. I just don' think we are in the position to take that type of salary in the middle of a rebuild imo. Our highest paid player is Randle at 18mil a year and he gives us 20/10 a night.
"I don’t know man, dude is a liability as a shooter.  We’ll give you one Elfrid Payton for him."
"a knicks fan that gets it. Julius randle/elfrid payton/austin rivers arent gonna do shit for your franchise long term. them overachieving and leading you to the 8 seed hurts you. Making the 8 seed is only good if its your young guys leading the way with some vets, not flawed players like randle and payton overachieving."
Playing Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton is ridiculously bad
"Yeah I saw that further up. Thing is, this interpretation of the rule is irrelevant if it isn't officiated that way, which it isn't. It's strict liability.   https://www.nba.com/news/elfrid-payton-jaren-jackson-suspended"
Except they almost always go by the letter of the law not the spirit of the law with this rule.  When elfrid payton shoved jae crowder last season JJJ got suspended for a game for taking 3 steps off the bench on the other side of the court to where the scuffle was happening.  Wouldn't surprise me to see a superstar getting special treatment though.
Laughs in Reggie bullock and Elfrid Payton
"Yeah me too, Randle is only 26 so he definitely has some years. I'd like to see him with a true second option because what he's doing with Elfrid Payton and RJ is actually pretty insane considering neither can shoot. If they do end up trading Randle I hope it's for a lot of picks cause he's playing so well."
Meanwhile Reggie Bullock is proving that Elfrid Payton Hair is contagious even when asymptomatic
I think this award should be for players like Elfrid Payton and Seth Curry. Not 2nd or 3rd year players who just got more playing time.
real talk elfrid payton looks so much better without the weird hair
Crazy to think Elfrid Payton is already the 32nd best player of all time at 26. Truly impressive
I would rather watch Elfrid Payton play into his 50s than watch/root for Trae Young
Elfrid Payton is extremely selfish...usually if you’re selfish you should at least be a decent player
we have a very dynamic Elfrid Payton we can offer you
Luxury brand Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton looking like Elfrid Payton   Julius Randle looking like KG
"Wild, Suggs seems like a perfect fit for them, no offense to Elfrid Payton"

"How is Elfrid ""Not an NBA player"" Payton all of a sudden almost an All Star."
"&gt; Elfrid Payton. He shot well tonight, but he seems like such a frustrating player to have running point for your team.   Yea. A lot of those problems you mentioned come straight down to him. Not finding the open man for 3. Forcing the pass to Randle to take a shot. Etc.  It's pretty much the same thing we saw last year. If Payton is playing well, it's less noticeable, but if he's bricking all of this just hits you in the face and becomes very frustrating to watch.  The game vs the Hawks was a great example of the offense opening up. The IQ/Rivers backcourt found the open man a lot, ball movement was better, etc...   Hopefully Payton either gets better fast, or we just move onto to IQ fulltime."
We lost to a team that plays Elfrid Payton for 42 fucking minutes.
"Thibs is a really fucking good head coach that plays to his players strengths  Almost everybody on the team is having one of their best seasons ever, Austin Rivers is a fucking monster, Alec Burks was averaging 20 ppg before he got hurt, Elfrid Payton looks like an above average starting caliber point guard, even Mitchell Robinson has cut down on the fouls"
"Wood currently: 5 GP, 24/10/2 on 62% TS  Randle currently: 7 GP, 22/11/7 on 60% TS  One guy has Wall and Harden creating plays for him, the other has Elfrid Payton"
julius randle and elfrid payton are both +25 what
"1) RJ Barrett  2) Julius Randle  3) Mitchell Robinson  4) Immanuel Quickley  5) Austin Rivers  6) Obi Toppin  7) Alec Burks/Kevin Knox (can’t decide)  Elfrid Payton is all yours, Seattle"
Idk but I do know Elfrid Payton ain’t

I'll give you a whole Elfrid Payton and Dennis Smith Jr for George Hill
"Yeah idk Curry just doesn't do it for me, I'm more of a Elfrid Payton kinda guy myself...."
"Payton doesn't usually shoot well, so having two other dudes that might bring something is always good.   I mean it'd be great if this the Elfrid Payton we're going to get the rest of the year, but I'm a bit cautious about that."
Elfrid Payton. Already had a mediocre year with us and we still re-sign him
I care if I have to watch elfrid Payton for 80% of the first three quarters
Immanuel Quickley is +15  Elfrid Payton is -11  so why are we starting Elf? are we just using IQ as a closer?
\*inahales deeply\* RJ BARRETT IS GOOD. Julius Randle is an all-star.  Quickley is a steal. Elfrid Payton didn't close the game. A year ago we had Fizdale.....
Can't believe the Hawks lost in spite of that MVP level performance by Elfrid Payton
Kyrie and KD ain't got shit on Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle
 ( I have a feeling this will get tons of downvotes since y’all hate the last name Ntilikina😭) I been a Frank fan since he was a frenchman. He is the only reason I watch the knicks otherwise I would disregard that team like me and millions of others do each year. I’ve noticed a couple things since I’ve watched all their games. The players seem jealous of Frank and I’m assuming they are jealous because 1. He’s better than most of them and 2. He gets more media attention than all of them combined (rightfully so). His teammates show that jealousy on the court when they don’t pass to him even if he’s open (anyone that watches their games can confirm this). They look god awful when frank isn’t on the court orchestrating the offence. Yet the coach refuses to start him when elfrid payton is struggling with the thought of a star frenchy taking his spot hence his terrible performance. For the knicks to win games they need to hand the keys to the team over to frank but because they are so damn prideful and in denial they keep losing🤦🏾‍♂️
"I still don’t know how we won that game, but damn was it a good feeling to win.   Having Immanuel Quickley helped offload some of our reliance on Elfrid Payton.  Austin Rivers is proving he’s dedicated to the process and willing to learn from Thibs.   I wish Thibs would keep his mask on."
Youd think Elfrid Payton was budget Westbrook if you looked at just his numbers
I’m so happy we’re starting Mitch and that our young guys are getting good minutes. The best thing is even Elfrid Payton looks competent in stretches.
im glad i have elfrid payton on my fantasy team instead of bertans
Elfrid Payton  Kris Dunn but idk if you wanna call him a PG anymore
As I thought Elfrid Payton should be playing small ball center
"This sub hates Russell Westbrook because they think it makes them huge brain geniuses for being able to say ""I actually know the big secret that box stats don't tell the whole story of a player's effectiveness,"" as though an at times inefficient Westbrook is worse than having Elfrid Payton as your starting point guard"
"Knicks winning behind Alec Burke, Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton feels...uninspiring? Don't get me wrong, I'm hyped to see the NY Kazoos playing some good ball. I just don't see the vision for the future when all the ""talent"" is riding the pine."
"You posted one at halftime that you deleted because it got downvoted to shit, you posted one at the end the game about Elfrid Payton and then two about RJ. You’re weird"
Julius Randle  Elfrid Payton   Kevin Knox  Mitchell Robinson  Frank Ntilikina  5 through 1
"Since Rondo came to the Pelicans. After that, Elfrid Payton. Then they finally got Lonzo"
"God if we trade for this oladipo man… him and Elfrid Payton play the same, 20 points on 20 shots"
"&gt; So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.  Size, strength, length, positional versatility.  &gt; For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  Did you notice all of these guys played on bad to pathetic defenses? Compared to Fournier being on a top 10 defense. There’s a difference between guarding elite players because your team is devoid of defensive talent and being the most important perimeter defender on a top 10 defense.   &gt; This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall. They are that kind of defense because of the minutes when he's not on the court.  Using individual drtg percentiles is doing my head in, I can’t think of why anyone would use that. I don’t know what you’re using to look at these but I would hazard a guess just based on logic that centers, other big men, and bench players dominate the upper percentiles. Last season his drtg was 109.5, which would have been the 7th best defense in the league. So in the minutes he was on they performed as the 7 best defense in the league, which is even better than our overall 10th ranked defense."
"&gt;Based on their defensive skill sets.  So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.   &gt;In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier  Teams are going to hunt the weak defender like Tor and Mil did the past 2 postseasons. Having AD and LeBron to help helps alot(so did Jonathan Isaac in 2019) but your still introducing a weak link and area they can attack to begin with.   For reference [you can look up from 2014-20 how much any defender spent on the opponents no 1, no 2, no 3 option](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  &gt;we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years  Im on CTG looking at the Magic's defensive rating when Fournier has been on the court the past 2 yrs:   This yr: 29th percentile Last yr: 51st percentile  This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall. They are that kind of defense because of the minutes when he's not on the court."
"The end of it was a little weird. A bunch of positivity, then randomly ""they're not even great tho"", half our roster is going to regress and we rely too much on Elfrid Payton lmao."
"Yeah why the hell haven’t Reggie Jackson and Elfrid Payton said anything about this? For that matter, what are their thoughts on Syria?"
Elfrid Payton too. The Knicks better have a good dentist.
"Dude barely has a PG to play with. The Knicks completely outplayed their talent level this season. We started most games with Elfrid Payton. The Hawks are easily a way more talented team and had Trae not gotten hurt, they would be the 4 seed most likely.   I love DRose, but he is not a starting PG anymore. He has played pretty well this series. We've also been running Alex Burks at PG.    I still think Randle is solid. Maybe not max solid, but still a very good player who hit a rough patch against a good team with a gameplan for him. Who else stepped up for the Knicks besides DRose this series? Nobody really has."
"John Wall slapped him in the face, Perkins dropped him with a hard screen, Elfrid Payton shoved him to the ground, for a dude that could ""beat up 95% of the league"" 99% of the league is not scared of him and more often than not usually gets the better of him in these dust ups lol"
"good good, now do elfrid payton"
Elfrid Payton
"Knicks got here by outhustling and overachieving with guys like Elfrid Payton starting, with our main center out, and with little to no depth. A carry job by RJ and Randle this season, then Rose helping out on that final run to close the season. The lack of depth is just a killer, but with the massive cap space this season it'd be nice to make some similar moves to the Hawks and grab good players the caliber of Bogi, Gallo, Capela, etc. We started Reggie Bullock, Elfrid Payton and Noel this season and those guys have a combined ZERO POINTS right now. We overachieved into a spot we're pretty much not ready for at all from a team building perspective, but I like the future outlook with more pieces and some actual depth."
Has Elfrid Payton really been deleted like that? I know they can’t score but they haven’t put someone on Trae?
Once you get a reputation most teams don’t wanna take a risk on the baggage. Trier is talented and a tough shot maker. Elfrid Payton was just starting don’t act like bad players don’t have roster spots in the league.
Oh you mean Elfrid Payton?
"Why is ESPN playing up this ""not a starter to start the series"" angle so hard as if everyone didn't already know he's miles better than Elfrid Payton? He's a 6MotY candidate and only came off the bench because Thibs liked sticking to that rotation since it worked really well"
Jrue ran point every year of his career except when he shared time with Rondo. The other point guards were Elfrid Payton and Lonzo. It’s like how Harden was the point guard his entire tenure at Houston but was classified a shooting guard
I’ll gladly get swept to see this happen. I’ll take Embiid mocking our chants with honor. And see Elfrid Payton beat someone up for getting popcorn spilt on him. Even though I wholeheartedly feel like he deserves it from our home crowd
He's so fucking bad. Go over to the Pelicans sub. Dude gets so much hate and it's deserved. Almost as much hate as Elfrid Payton.
Elfrid Payton is next
Pat Bev is just west coast Elfrid Payton
"Knicks were like 29th on the power rankings before the season started . Yeah ppl are upset when their losing games in the playoffs but who the hell would be upset that their team which starts elfrid Payton , Reggie bullock and nerlens noel would be in the playoffs yet alone host a series . Knicks fans are ecstatic about how this season went ."
Elfrid Payton is actual dogshit. The Knicks need Lonzo way more than DeRozan.
Huh? We have elfrid Payton. I didn’t say we need an all-NBA PG
*Coach Thibs' message in the locker room:*  I'm gonna call out your name and call you trash  Rj Barrett... YOU'RE TRASH  Elfrid Payton... YOU'RE TRASH  Frankie boy... YOU'RE TRASH  Julius Randle... oh my gosh I better not see your name on any All-NBA list. YOU'RE TRASH! If I see your name on an all NBA list I might have to kill somebody.
My theory is that Elfrid Payton has some serious dirt on Thibs.
"Hey maybe we should try Elfrid Payton, nothing else is working"
Elfrid Payton getting a DNP
I just noticed Elfrid Payton has not played a single minute.
"The better question is ""What teams are good enough to overcome having to play Elfrid Payton for 40 minutes a game their entire playoff run and still win the championship?"""
I think the Knicks needs some Elfrid Payton minutes
How many teams are an Elfrid Payton away?
Thibs was really starting Elfrid Payton(who shouldnt even be in the rotation) the whole season wow
Elfrid Payton consistently has the Knicks starting games 14-7 before we call a timeout
He can take Elfrid Payton and Frank
[Every Knick to Elfrid Payton before the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO1b95GC1vg)
Elfrid Payton Jr.
"I agree, its ridiculous that elfrid Payton is starting"
"Payton is a better coordinator of the offense (which for the Nuggest I think that role is given to Jokic and Facu). Rivers is better at beating his player off the dribble and scoring but the Knicks have Rose, IQ, and Burks who Thibs trusted more in that role. I also think Elfrid is a better on-ball defender as well (he is not doing so well against Trae but that is what I saw all year)"
Can we have him back? We'll give you one starting point guard™ Elfrid Payton.  **he's really good** allegedly.
Does anyone get Cam Payne confused with Elfrid Payton? I know they’re different but they remind me of each other
This is the best thing Drummond's done in a Laker uniform   Just need Elfrid Payton to imitate Theo Pinson and we'll be great
Elfrid Payton has more games where he does nothing
but they have elfrid payton
He wasn’t getting minutes after Derrick Rose arrival.. Tbh they should have waived Elfrid Payton but idk why or how that dude is still the starting PG for the entire year like this
Knicks chose Elfrid Payton for Rivers.....
I think he was on the Knicks but getting DNPs for Elfrid Payton
Elfrid Payton had multiple double-digit assist games this year. Would you call him a play maker or a good passer?
As soon as he said he modeled part of his game after Elfrid payton last year that was the beginning of the end.
Elfrid Payton.
Can you imagine the reaction Knicks fans would have if they maxed Elfrid freaking Payton.
They have bird rights on Elfrid Payton
Nobody on the Knicks roster besides Elfrid Payton even for one second should be considered soft. Even Obi has been making an impact of late. IQ was drilling 30 footers in his first playoff game. Exciting Team.
Elfrid Payton: He sucks  Trae Young: self-explanatory  Reggie Miller: also self-explanatory
"like that dude on the KP tweet ""I also have pics of Elfrid Payton in the strip club"""
"Lmao, Knicks fans on Twitter are IDing the spitting fan as Elfrid Payton. ""This is unacceptable behavior and the man needs to be banned from all Knicks games."""
"Lol i swear to god, the loudest the garden got in game 1 was when DRose checked in for elfrid in the first quarter.  And then in the third quarter a “we want rose” chant broke out with elfrid on the court.  Payton shoukd not be getting those minutes but I can’t imagine how much it must suck to be the only player on the Knicks rn that isn’t irrationally beloved by the fanbase"
Can anyone please explain why they start elfrid Payton just to play 5 minutes. Does he bring anything to this team or tibs just not want to start quickly/rose.
"Elfrid payton started and got 5 minutes, Aaron Baynes type beat."
"The Yankees currently have  like 4 players more popular than him, and so do the Mets. Zach Wilson and Barkley are also more popular.   He will drop down somewhere in the Gary Sanchez to elfrid Payton tier tbh"
"if it's like orlando magic elfrid payton then I'd get all the hair comments, but trae and dillon's hair just grows that way. what are they supposed to do?"
Question from someone kind of out of the loop — why is Elfrid Payton starting for the Knicks when D Rose is coming off the bench and playing significantly more minutes?
I saw a stat the other day that basically said Trae has absolutely fried elfrid Payton all year. It’s going to take more than a single turnover for me to change my mind
I’ll put it this way. Imagine if Drummond couldn’t rebound or hit 2 footers. That’s Elfrid Payton but way shorter
He lost his basketball abilities when he cut his [hair](https://cdn.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Elfrid-Payton-New-Orleans-Pelicans-NBA-Free-Agency-2019.jpg).  Like a barbershop version of the critically acclaimed 2002 dramedy Like Mike
Elfrid Payton is the reason for the tear drops on my guitar
scalding hot take: Elfrid Payton is not very good at basketball
do people understand how crippling it is to start elfrid payton the first 5-6 mins of the 1st and 3rd quarter. Its a negative on an already mediocre roster. Its taken this freakin long for him to bench payton...
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ELFRID PAYTON DOESN'T START
elfrid payton really starts so D rose doesn't play 45 minutes
Its the bane of all knicks fans existence: Elfrid Payton
Best part about the start of the 2nd half is that elfrid Payton is gonna be in the game.
I hope Elfrid Payton doesn't watch replays of half time shows.  Kenny can't even remember his name then says he's not a true starter. Damn lol
"lmaoooo at Elfrid Payton being an ""honorary starter"". so true"
Don't worry Knicks bros Elfrid Payton will you the first 4 minutes of the 3rd quartrr.
Yeah Thibs' Elfrid Payton fetish kind of ruins the stat
"There’s such a huge difference in talent and it’s apparent in the playoffs. Knicks should’ve never been a 4 seed.. the fact that they are is insane . No playoff team starts elfrid Payton , Reggie bullock and Nerlens Noel . They are solid bench pieces ."
Somehow Elfrid Payton still starts in that scenario.
The way Knick fans make Elfrid Payton the scapegoat for anything is hilarious
I haven’t genuinely hated one of our own players since Bargnani was in the locker room but holy shit fuck you Elfrid Payton
"I WANT ELFRID PAYTON NOWHERE NEAR A BASKETBALL AND PLEASE SIT RANDLE, HES ICE COLD AGAIN"
WTF is the point of Elfrid Payton on the court?
Damn the whole bench went to pick up Elfrid Payton lmao. Love these Knicks.
can I interest you in one elfrid payton perhaps  in seriousness you'll probably take a run at lonzo or something and find he's not the answer for you either
Elfrid Payton in the Knicks
I already offered Elfrid Payton
"""u want elfrid payton"""
Clippers need a point guard and the Knicks have a really good one in Elfrid Payton available
Jae Crowder got beat up by Elfrid Payton don’t forget
I WISH Tom Thibs would just let Frank Nitilikita just guard trae young all game! FUCK Elfrid Payton
Lmao the Knicks fan in the twitter comments talking about how he saw Elfrid Payton there as well 💀
Literally no one would even know this was happening if he wasn’t included.   We have guys like Elfrid Payton and Mike Scott in the league who I consider it offensive they’re here.
"Yeah, this argument works if the difference is 5 assists to 6 assists. But 7.2 was top 15 in the league, and over double that of Morris. That argument does not work when the disparity is that high. That's like saying Marcus Smart is better than Chris Paul because numbers aren't everything - you have to then back that up with other evidence.  But let's dig into the evidence - beyond just counting stats. If Morris is better beyond the box score, his advanced stats should reflect that, right?  Payton 19/20 LEBRON: 2.04  Morris 20/21 LEBRON: -0.75  Payton 19/20 Wins Added: 3.6  Morris 20/21 Wins Added: 1.3  Payton 19/20 RAPTOR WAR: 2.5  Morris 20/21 RAPTOR WAR: 1.8  Payton 19/20 VORP: 0.6  Morris 20/21 VORP: 0.4  Payton also led in BPM, WS, etc. I literally could not find an advanced stat that did not significantly favour Elfrid Payton over Monte Morris. All the evidence indicates Payton is a decent NBA player who has been put in a bad situation as a starter on a playoff squad with reduced minutes when he should be a sixth man (I will admit it is also a likely factor that he's struggling/having a genuinely bad season). All the evidence also suggests that Morris is a league average bench player who would probably suffer a worse statistical fate in Payton's situation."
We'll do a straight up trade for Elfrid Payton    &amp; 1st round picks
Elfrid Payton - sucking
I’m sorry did Elfrid Payton die?
"Elfrid Payton, Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson, Frank Ntlikina and a couple picks"
Elfrid Payton playing like ass  = Rose minutes increase and fatigue settle for him because of old age. We need Rose to atleast get rest so he won't break down later in the game. Drummond atleast  s able to be servicable in getting rebounds.
1. Elfrid Payton on the basketball court  2. Nerlens Noel going for a rebound  3. Obi Toppin taking a corner 3
I’d join the Knicks so I could lock Elfrid Payton in the lockerroom before the game starts to stop him from hurting the team
He’s the best backup PG in the league. Said it last year and I’m even more certain now... Don’t really consider D Rose a backup because he plays more mins than Elfrid Payton.
"You're hardly gonna find mass-roasting more brutal than if you just type ""Elfrid Payton"" in a search bar anytime they play, so really I'm not shocked that it came to this come playoff time. After 4 minutes of Payton matching up Young, Thibs saying ""yeah that's enough"".  Knicks offense looks a class better thanks to Rose. I imagine he will rest if there's a blowout in either direction, or other players do better."
Whenever Elfrid Payton is in the game
1. Elfrid Payton with the ball in his hands 2. Randle getting the ball in clutch time (less than 1 minute) over Burks/Bullock/Rose/RJ 3. Obi Toppin playing well and getting subbed out anyway
"I think the most telling thing about Elfrid Payton is that 3 different teams were happy to show him the door without even having another option lined up, and no one (either at the time or in hindsight) thought that it was a bad move."
I remember in the off-season in the Knicks bring back Elfrid Payton thread the top comment was just a Knicks fan saying “oh fuck off” and for some reason it was just so funny.
how did elfrid payton ever even get in the nba in the first place
We have the most cap space in the league. We could literally afford steph and basically keep the exact same roster we have now with minor losses. Now hand him over and we might give u Elfrid Payton and the Dallas 1st round pick
"Nah thybulle has a better chance of starting on a good team and it's not even close. Tbh, Maxey may too.   19/20 fultz put up numbers comparable to Elfrid Payton, 12/5 on below average efficiency. Thybulle is 6th on the dpoy ladder and maxey has similar stats to markelle per 100 possessions and is younger. If maxey was on a bad team like fultz he'd probably also be starting. What indicates that fultz will be a better player?"
"So your argument is that Elfrid Payton is as skilled as Wilt, Baylor, and West?"
"It was very obviously not easier when Oscar Robertson was doing it.  From 1961-1966, Robertson (30/11/10) and Jerry West (28/5/7) were the only players to average 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game.  From 2016-2021, 14 different players have averaged 5 rebound and 5 assists per game--including 6 players who have averaged 7/7 (Russ, LeBron, Simmons, Doncic, Draymond).

there was a great headline i saw “knicks fans absolutely love their team.....except Elfrid Payton”   and in couldnt have agreed more haha
Or elfrid payton
CP3 taking minutes from Elfrid Payton doesn't make up an 8 game difference? I feel like it would
I hear Elfrid Payton is pretty nice.
"Still remember this one time when a nephew called Westbrook the ""poor man's elfrid payton""..."
I mean atleast you don’t have Elfrid Payton as your starting PG and you’re the 4th seed in the East.
Just get Elfrid Payton hopped up on PCP and you’re like halfway there
"I considered Simmons, but our weakness isn't a point guard that is good at defense and can't shoot. He's basically a bigger and (much) better Elfrid Payton."
lol we are stubbornly playing elfrid payton
Our starting pg is Elfrid Payton and our starting center has been injured for a large Majority of the season
RJ Barret needs to do this to Elfrid Payton.
"I love the revisionist history. No one in this sub considered this Knicks roster to be well constructed. Hell, I bet if I asked this sub right now if they’d rather have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo ball, Steven Adams, and Bledsoe they would say yes over rj barrett, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, and Nerlons Noel. I’m not trying to slight Zion I just think that Randle is. A better overall basketball player. I fully understand how insane Zion’s efficiency is right now and I in now way would rather have Randle over Zion"
I trade him to the Knicks for Elfrid Payton and then i quit
"It's not really an overreaction. Next year all of our young guys will be better and more experienced, Mitch will be healthy, and considering Randle is only 26 there's no reason not to expect him to improve more. He's already playing at an All-NBA level, and since our main weakness right now is needing a good PG so Elfrid Payton no longer gets any PT, Chris Paul would be genuinely perfect for us because he provides everything we lack while also being a great defender; then for PJ, he's a great 3+D guy especially in catch and shoot scenarios which he would always be in with CP3 and Randle playmaking for him. Think about it, it's hardly a stretch to say with CP3 and Tucker on this current roster we'd potentially have 5 or more wins which would put us right there with the Bucks and Nets. Do I think we'd win the championship? Doubtful, but you never know. The point is we would be a legitimate contender."
Elfrid Payton has this weird quirk where he forgets how to play basketball when the game starts
Elfrid Payton freezing out RJ and Randle stopped him from having his first 30 point game and Randle from getting his first triple double of the season
Elfrid Payton gonna have D Rose getting the highest plus minus of his career.
I always imagine how much better our score would be without elfrid lambchop Payton
He’s not a good fit but we have 34 wins with dog shit Elfrid Payton as our starting point guard. Not saying I want to sign him but I wouldn’t say he’s an awful fit
TIL Elfrid Payton is on the Knicks. TIalsoL that Taj Gibson is still on the NBA and is on the Knicks.
&gt; the Knicks are a bad offensive team.   &gt; this is because of Elfrid Payton.
You know who I never hear about working after? Elfrid Payton.   Coincidence? I think NOT.
We won’t give you thibs. But for the low low price of a 2052 2nd round pick you can have an Elfrid Payton.
The sole argument is his love affair with Elfrid Payton
"Thibs feels like a lock. He's got one flaw, and it's that Elfrid Payton has major blackmail evidence on him."
D Rose is always the difference maker because the gap between him and Elfrid Payton is just staggering. We're a completely different team when he plays
"In 10 years, it's gonna be arguing for starting Elfrid Payton 😂"
"I will give Elfrid Payton this, he is good at getting through screens defensively."
He's way better than Elfrid Payton dude.  Dont look that average rotation point guard gift horse in the mouth.
Elfrid Payton isn’t even fit to play on a fisher price hoop
We are at minus 11 for Elfrid Payton right now.
So far Elfrid Payton is the only Knick in the negative.  Rose played 12 minutes and Elf played 7.  The Keith Bogans baby.
"Imagine how good the Knicks would be if they nailed the Opi Topin and Kevin Knox picks.  Seriously lile if they had Haliburton on the team would they have a ""need"" for Elfrid Payton."
Right now Elfrid Payton is minus 5.  I'll try and keep track this whole game.
"Yep. And honestly, he plays way better with Elfrid Payton off the court, so I wanna see how he does with a real point guard hopefully"
Idk if you worded the title correctly but what I do know is:  Derrick Rose - On court: +10.4 Off court: -0.5  Immanuel Quickley - On court: +6.9 Off court: -1.0  Elfrid Payton - On court: -2.0 Off court: +5.1  Come playoffs Derrick Rose should be starting and Payton should probably be out of the rotation with Frank getting 15ish mins. Putting Quckley with Frank allows Frank to cover Quickley's defensive flaws and gives us another shooter to put in the corner rather than Payton who can't shoot at all.  Quickley/Payton - On court: -15.4  Quickley/Ntilikina - On court: +1.9
Can I interest you in one slightly used Elfrid Payton?
"Elfrid Payton looks like a solid offensive player when Trae guards him, so i'll go with Trae."
"Have you seen the Knicks rotation? Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Derrick Rose, Obi Toppin is not better than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Poole, Bazemore"
He is mentoring the Knicks' point guard of the future in IQ. He will be the MIP after they drop Elfrid Payton next season and let Quickley take the reins.
"Don't watch a lot of Knicks games, but why tf is Elfrid Payton starting over IQ/Rose?"
Elfrid Payton
I'm talking about Elfrid Payton bruh
"as a knicks fan, he's right.  we all just want to figure out how to get rid of elfrid payton. ha."
"Literally none of these guys lead their teams in touches.  Booker ranks 76th in touches per game, behind guys like Delon Wright, Elfrid Payton, and Theo Maledon."
I really don’t think making comments about how Elfrid Payton is bad at basketball on Reddit makes me a piece of shit OR makes me tolerate people who say shit to his family. Bad take
Meh. The criticism for last season was deserved. As is the praise for the season he’s having now.   We kinda bullied Randle into getting better. But it only works if the guy is actually talented (see: Elfrid Payton).
Is that not the case for the Jazz? Lmao. Snyder is a great coach and they have arguably the best depth in the league. We play Taj Gibson and Elfrid Payton significant minutes...
The league isn’t ready for what will come when that happens. Remember when Elfrid Payton cut his hair?
"KP is a soft lil bitch. As a hardcore Knicks fan who hasn't missed a game in decades, he was always like this in NY as well, ever since draft day. Dude thinks he has won like 5 MVPs and championships by the way he acts. I wouldn't trade one Elfrid Payton for 20 KPs."
Zion for Elfrid Payton who says no
"The Pelicans already had Elfrid Payton. But to be fair he was getting triple doubles like he was Westbrook there, as opposed to Knick Payton."
Thin mints &gt; Elfrid payton
"&gt;You guys were starting Teague, Wiggins, Butler, Taj. None of those guys are great shooters. Just shooting threes doesn't make a good offense if you lack the personnel to make them.   And the guy who brought in Teague,Taj and Butler was Thibs. So it was his philosophy to bring in non shooters and play an outdated offence.  &gt;Mfer we are starting Elfrid Payton and we're right behind Boston. We were a projected high lottery team going into the season. And again, no, I don't think the vast majority of coaches would've had this much success for us.  Yeah because Boston is shit this season."
"&gt;Do you think he improved so much over the one year he wasn't coaching KAT that he doubled his attempts? We literally attempted 22 3's in our playoff season. The man is allergic to the perimeter.    You guys were starting Teague, Wiggins, Butler, Taj. None of those guys are great shooters. Just shooting threes doesn't make a good offense if you lack the personnel to make them.     &gt;And a coach with a different approach couldn't get more out of your team?   Mfer we are starting Elfrid Payton and we're right behind Boston. We were a projected high lottery team going into the season. And again, no, I don't think the vast majority of coaches would've had this much success for us."
Knicks fans call this the Elfrid Payton experience
Stop it with this Elfrid Payton shit
Fuck Elfrid Payton
This must be how other teams feel when Elfrid Payton goes off
The fact that Bledshit can’t even guard Elfrid Payton driving to the basket lmao
Schroder is not worth 100 mill but he is not worse than elfrid fucking payton.
"First of all, he has the best PPG in the game on his team that’s Bradley Beal. 2nd of all, you act like he’s playing winning basketball. The wizards are a bottom level team. Lol. They can get the same record playing elfrid Payton. He ain’t carrying shit if they keep taking Ls."
I can promise you schroeder is much better than elfrid Payton
"As an honest Mavs fan, I think we need to trade Luka to the Knicks for Elfrid Payton"
Where’s the one with Elfrid Payton and triple doubles
Idek how this is possible but Elfrid Payton is unironically overrated by non Knicks fans because they think he's just mediocre or below average instead of absolutely terrible
"Elfrid Payton, for two reasons  1. He gets an absolutely insane amount of hate, a lot more than anyone else 2. He can go off for some pretty decent games, and is a solid defender, especially considering he usually has tough assignments"
Elfrid Payton has more good games than Knicks fans like to admit
"Maybe Elfrid Payton?  I feel like most of our roster has had enough stops (or big enough stops) that people know who they are, Payton I feel like people mostly just knew him for the haircut (at least that was all I knew about him before he came here)."
"If you don’t watch the Knicks, we’re basically Memphis Grit N Grind basketball. Very slow pace, low turnovers, don’t take 3s, Randle being Zbo like in the midrange etc.   Replace Elfrid Payton with an All Star PG and I think we could upset the Bucks."
Elfrid Payton because of this STAT  Elfrid Payton career Assists per game: 6.4 APG   Michael Jordan 5.3 APG   Kobe Bryant 4.7 APG   Allen Iverson 6.2 APG   Walt Frazier 6.1 APG   Nikola Jokic 5.8 APG
That’s Elfrid “Most Triple-Doubles in a Season in Pelicans Franchise History” Payton to you
"&gt;The Sixers traded Iguodala for Bynum, who didn’t play, and were left with Holiday, Evan Turner, Jason Richardson, Elton Brand, Spencer Hawes, Thaddeus Young and very few draft picks.  Philadelphia surrendered a grand total of one draft pick in the Bynum trade -- a 2018 first.  And even that pick was returned to the Sixers ( along with Dario Saric ) long before being executed, in return for Elfrid Payton.  &gt; After three years we acquired two future all stars...  So did the other teams I referenced.  Miami acquired Butler and Adebayo ( and Dragic ) without tanking.  Toronto acquired Lowry and Leonard ( and Gasol and Siakam ) without tanking.  Milwaukee acquired Antetokounmpo, and Middleton and Holiday without tanking.  This idea that one has to embarrass themselves for three years just to obtain two All-stars is unsupported by fact, and obviously not the case."
"We are not, or were not, or will not be any kind of title contender with or without Kemba lol  But we're gonna be a fun team that hopefully continues to grow in the right direction. Kemba in NY should be fun, even if he's not the same player he once was. I have faith he can at least bounce back a bit offensively, and shit all he needs to do is be better than Elfrid Payton to be an upgrade...which literally anyone is."
"I get he's not what he once was, but what's his VOEP (Value over Elfrid Payton)?"
We got him for like 6-12 million and he's not playing intense minutes and our PG last year was Elfrid Payton
Kemba kinda sucks but will instantly be one of the best point guards we’ve had in my lifetime. We’ve been so shit at PG for so long. Idk if I could have done another season with Elfrid Payton.
Wowwwww let's go! Kemba back in MSG to replace Elfrid Payton
"NO ELFRID PAYTON, FUCK YES."
Its not Elfrid Payton im happy
"With the other options being Schröder and his issues, overpay for Reggie, pray the young guys step up AND Rose holds up, or Elfrid Payton, yeah, I'm counting this as a win."
Don’t like Kenna’s game as well but man we suffered through elfrid payton for two years lol
I was really hoping for Elfrid Payton. Oh well.
Not bad. Kemba is coming off a down year and looking to prove he still has it. I think he can help them a lot   Then again anyone but Elfrid Payton could help them a lot
"Elfrid Payton is anti matter, elfrid Peyton is mega-gravity, the dude is so incredibly terrible."
ELFRID PAYTON
Unless they’re trading Randle they don’t have the salary to send out to give Shroeder’s delusional ass $25M per year. They’re either signing him with the remaining space or not at all. Hopefully they can secure him or Reggie Jackson as both would significantly upgrade the great Elfrid Payton
dude whats wrong with you?  knicks just got rid of elfrid payton and now you want another inconsistent headcase at Point? no thank you
&gt; Elfrid Payton  I lol'd. you guys really hate him lmfao
L - This post adds no value to anyone's lives  A - I don't know what you thought you were doing here  K - Mods go ahead and remove  E - Elfrid Payton  R - If you're still reading this I'm sorry  S - Please find a hobby
"Re signed all our good pieces from last year besides bullock, got fournier, and (I pray to god) are done with the elfrid Payton disaster"
Y'all really forgetting Mitch was hurt second half of the season and our record after the all start break.   All we did was switch Bullock w Fournier. And hopefully dump Elfrid Payton
"if you think getting rid of russ as your starting PG is great, imagine getting rid of elfrid payton."

Elfrid Payton is available.
"I see you've forgotten Elfrid Payton. You are lucky, it took a lot of drinking for me to forget"
Elfrid Payton
Holy shit Burks and Noel back would be huge. Would not be too mad if we get Dennis on a team friendly deal. I’d rather start a rock then see Elfrid Payton ever play
i mean… he is better than Elfrid Payton… right?
Where's elfrid Payton and Plumlee?
"Yah, he's a 4x All-Star, there's absolutely no chance that giving Demar Derozan all of the minutes that were going to Elfrid Payton last year would be a downgrade for you guys aha   It'd definitely be a bit clunky to start, but I think you could find some creative ways to make a Derozan/Barrett/Randle line-up work"
Sure you can have Knox and Elfrid Payton lol
"Rob Hennigan for the Magic was pretty horrific, especially towards the end  Started off well getting Vucevic, Fournier and Tobias for cheap but it was all downhill from there.   Gave up an extra first round pick for the privilege of drafting Elfrid Payton, because he telegraphed his interest and Hinkie bent him over.  Traded away Oladipo and Sabonis for an past prime Ibaka.  Hired Vogel who was terrible.  Signed Biyombo to a massive deal.  Traded away Tobias for nothing. We got Ersan and Jennings back, both whom left in FA a month later."
They didn’t know who to start elfrid Payton or Schroeder
We will comfortably be in a play in spot assuming a relatively healthy season. You’re also ignoring how we don’t have Elfrid Payton anymore who is honestly largely responsible for our start
Also have to keep in mind we won’t have Elfrid Payton anymore. It’s honestly a wash
"Even more than the lack of big it was the lack of capable guards that did the team in.  Derrick Rose can't play the number of minutes required for a starting point guard in the playoffs. Quickly looks promising, but is much more a scorer than a playmaker at this point. RJ isn't really a guard at all. Elfrid Payton is simply not good enough.   If Mitchell Robinson can stay healthy (unfortunately a big if), that's one problem solved, but the Knicks haven't had competent guard play for a decade now. That'll be the difference maker next season."
"Ugh my main fear is that this will not only lose us Derrick, but would mean am Elfrid Payton return."
"“Most likely peaked last season”  Yeah, a 26 year old who had Elfrid Payton as a starting pg has a breakout season is definitely going to get worse even though most players hit their prime 4 years later. Seems VERY likely"
"Right now, I'm wondering if a lot of the Pelicans issues could have been mitigated if Bledsoe had been the 1 instead and placing Lonzo more off-ball. Maybe Bledsoe wouldn't have checked out.       Lonzo is notoriously finicky to work in. Do you know how hard it is for a point guard to not fit with Jrue? Elfrid Payton. Rajon Rondo. Tim Frazier. Ish Smith. Seemingly every point guard that the Pelicans ran opposite Jrue gave acceptable production when the starter."
"Heck of a lot better than elfrid Payton   If they actually back up the brinks trucks and pay what Schro is asking, then yeah that’s an L. He’s a good player"
You greedy fucks are going to take both?!  I swear to god if we get left holding the bag with another season of Elfrid Payton I will fucking lose it.
&gt; 31% shooter from 3pt  Had to look this up because I didn't believe you lol. Wtf that's 2% higher than Elfrid Payton...why did I think he was a good shooter this whole time?
Preview of the rest of the lakers target list for this summer:  Markelle Fultz   Bismack biyombo  Dwight Howard  Elfrid payton  Josh jackson  Tony Allen  Ricky rubio
No tired of taking Orlando's crap players like Elfrid Payton.
"Literally 3 of the worst shooting seasons from a volume guard in league history. Like, Elfrid Payton bad percentages."
In combination with Elfrid Payton shooting abilities
You could've had Elfrid Payton for free. Just saying.
"Lonzo really didn't fit with Jrue. When guys like Tim Frazier, Ish Smith, and Elfrid Payton play better, from a fit perspective, there's something wrong."
I don't think there can be anymore hat silliness than Lonnie Walker or Elfrid Payton draft night
Elfrid Payton is easily top 5 worst starting PGs in the league
"Otto Porter will definitely be better than people think he is when he is not making ridiculous money. This will now be called the Nic Batum effect where a lowering of a salary, role and expectations combine with a fresh start to make a player better. Only 27 years old  Elfrid Payton will be solid guard depth for a team, maybe the knicks again. He is only 27 and scored 10 points a game every year since after his rookie year  Luke Kornet in the right situation could serve a Boban, but with a 3 point shot role of limited minutes and high efficiency on a low salary. Only 26 and he is 7' 2''  Raul Neto will succeed as a backup guard if a team has some players who can shoulder the offensive load."
Ah yes I just got transported to 2014 and the magic fans are excited for a Oladipo Elfrid payton and Aaron Gordon core.
Yes especially Elfrid Payton.
"I'd say for Quickley you need to give him another year. Don't forget, that Knicks fans found him a breath of fresh air compared to Elfrid Payton too. But remember the hype around Brandon Clarke? Very disappointing second year."
Elfrid Payton   Markelle Fultz   TJ McConnell   Ben Simmons   Joel Embiid
Elfrid Payton
I'd offer a second rounder for him if I were the Knicks' GM. Literally can't be worse than Elfrid Payton.
I'd love him on the Knicks considering he only has a partial guarantee next year. Would be a significant upgrade over Elfrid Payton no matter how you slice it. We're not getting anyone major this off-season.
"For better or worse, Bledsoe (if bought out) feels like an obvious Elfrid Payton replacement in New York if the Knicks don’t have a bigger move coming. Bring in Bledsoe as the nominal starter and bring back Rose in his sixth man role."
"yes, they played him off the bench intentionally so that their bench lineups didn’t suck. are you seriously arguing elfrid payton was a better point guard for the Knicks this season than DRose?"
Add Elfrid Payton and we have a deal!
"Dont understand the interest in him. He is like a taller younger, more athletic Elfrid Payton.  Good defense but cant shoot to save his life."
"Elfrid Payton is only 27 and has had some pretty good seasons, when starting is a pretty regular triple double type player but can't seem to hold onto a starting pg spot in this new era of pgs. Another shocker is nerlens noels is only 27 (same age as Embiid who was drafted a year after him)"
Elfrid Payton is only 27
"The past year in the knicks subreddit was especially toxic, because Elfrid Payton wasn't capable of playing at a starting level. Fans were flaming him on all his social media accounts and cheering when he got subbed out of games."
"&gt;PG Elfrid Payton: vs Bucks - 27 pts, 3 reb, 7 ast, 2 stl, 12/16 fg, 3/3 3pt in 29 minutes.  Oh my gosh, I remember the beginning of the season where Elfrid Payton was playing like MVP Westbrook. I looked at the scores expecting to see us going to 0-3 and the Knicks were beating the Bucks by almost 30 and I legit thought that google was fucking up and not updating the Bucks' score or something."
"Elfrid Payton and Hezonja, both his draft picks from Orlando"
As long as Scott Perry lets go of his Elfrid Payton experiment this is fine I guess
Didn’t hr also lead the signing of elfrid Payton?
Understandable.  The last time Knicks reddit was so against signing a player was Elfrid Payton and we did indeed resign him....  Pain.
Kevin Knox for Damian lillard Julius randle for fuckin korkmaz Ben Simmons for Elfrid payton
julius randle and elfrid payton are gonna hang a championship banner in the garden
Knicks will take him for a elfrid payton and kevin knox. I think they're versatile pieces
And when you look at that draft it was pretty spotty that high:  1. Wiggins  2. Jabari Parker  3. Embiid  4. Aaron Gordon  5. Exum  6. Marcus Smart  7. Julius Randle  8. Stauskas  9. Vonleh  10. Elfrid Payton  Obviously Embiid is the best choice but I don't fault anybody for not wanting to gamble on him. After that Randle and Smart are the only other two guys really worth a damn and it took Randle awhile. Maybe Gordon with a full training camp and season with Denver. But the rest of it is pretty fucking yikes.  So ending up with Kevin Love and a title was a pretty good return.
Isn't Elfrid Payton still starting?
Do you.  I saw Elfrid Payton and Andre Drummond start in the playoffs this weekend and I'm starting to wonder if you have to be good or not.
Knicks bench was huge. Hawks need Gallo and Hunter to get going. Elfrid Payton should not see another minute of NBA basketball. Trae Young.
Such an insult to D Rose to be starting Elfrid Payton over him
Elfrid “Vontae Davis” Payton
Elfrid Payton must be an absolute demon in practice or something
"I've seen a ton of Knicks games this season, and Thibs' love for Elfrid Payton will never not confuse me."
Can Elfrid Payton be released in the middle of a game.
I get the feeling Knicks fans aren't very fond of Elfrid Payton lol
"Elfrid Payton is...um, something"
Elfrid Payton GuyBalls🦧🦧🦧
no mas elfrid payton. no mas
Elfrid Payton must be using something to blackmail Thibs
Why the fuck does Elfrid Payton play? Fucking trash can of a player.
I just realized the Hawks are hiding Collins on Elfrid Payton lol.
Elfrid Payton is trash. Get him back on the bench.
Elfrid Payton putting on a clinic.
knicks need to forever bench elfrid payton
Kenny putting Elfrid Payton on blast
So what I'm gathering from this segment by Kenny is that Elfrid Payton shouldn't be out there lol
Does Elfrid Payton have incriminating pics of Thibs or something? Absolutely no reason the dude should start the second half
Elfrid Payton still has the first 6 minutes of the third quarter to ease your concerns.
Knicks need to upgrade that elfrid payton position so bad
Elfrid Payton playing this like its a preseason game
"Im fucking here to see Texas native Julius Randle and bayou Jesus Elfrid Payton, body tf out the weak ass Hawks."
Elfrid payton just came to my house party where there was a COVID positive person
"i will trade you elfrid payton for james harden, I think this is a fair trade you should take it"
Jimmy shooting worse from 3 than Elfrid Payton was not a stat I expected to hear
still a better playmaker than Elfrid Payton
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion’s? Fit is one thing, but he’s playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
Draymond with the Elfrid Payton level move
fuck Elfrid Payton
Elfrid 'brick' payton
"i know i'm biased because im a knicks fan, but elfrid payton should win this hands down. these other guys might be bad, but at least they're somewhat trying. elf on the other hand has a tendency to [literally do nothing when he is on the court](https://twitter.com/tommybeer/status/1394080669337325569?s=21) 4 on 5 every time he's on the floor, plus turnovers and missed layups of course."
Drummond and Elfrid Payton it is
"As an honest Atlanta Hawks fan, I think putting Capela on Randle is the only way to sweep the Knicks. DeAndre Hunter should guard Elfrid Payton, the best 2 way guard in the East."
I thought this was gonna be Elfrid Payton for SURE. Straight up ROBBED.
It’s not an understatement to say Elfrid Payton was robbed. I understand using stats which is fair but I don’t know if a player put up a worse 2021 tape than payton.
Weren't Elfrid Payton and Rodney Hood on last year's list too?
"I came into the thread and said to myself ""as a Knick fan...it has to be Elfrid Payton."" Happy to know many of us share in the misery of having an LVP on our squad lol"
"I agree, Elfrid Payton is the next Bradley Beal"
"his TS% went from 55% to 48%. Which is 2nd to last, only Elfrid Payton being worse. Maybe he can pick it up, but he was already average at best and then he dropped off a cliff."
Elfrid Payton isn’t high enough on your list . No way there’s 3 other people more useless on the court than he is
Good to see Elfrid Payton getting some love. He has been terrible this season and it's time the world knows it.
Yeah but does Elfrid Payton really deserve more minutes than the other 4 point guards on the roster? Really ask yourself
"That's ridiculous , Elfrid Payton is the real MVP."
Theo pinson over Elfrid Payton
He said that shit to Elfrid Payton before our game. I saw it happen. Its meaningless   I was next to him in the arcade too.  He said to like 4 people while posted up at the air hockey table
Derrick Rose over Elfrid Payton currently
&gt; smart drafting  2013 - Michael Carter-Williams (11)  2014 - Elfrid Payton (10)  2015 - Jahlil Okafor (3)  2017 - Markelle Fultz (1)  Go on...
Elfrid Payton is a better playmaker than Jokic by virtue of playing a more valuable playmaking position   /s
Elfrid Payton averages like 12 minutes per game in the rose era   Derrick Rose  would  make old man Kidd do the cba cha slide
"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"
Forget what Melo would do. Old Jason Kidd would post up Elfrid Payton to death
How do expansion teams get players? Does each team have to donate a few players or something? Will they take Elfrid Payton? Please?
Elfrid Payton has already been booed this season with just a few thousand fans in attendance
"Fortunately we have several players who have done well to get over the top of screens this year. Unfortunately Elfrid Payton is not one of those players. Payton's pretty good at staying tight on his man, and he's quick. But he doesn't have the footwork or play with the strength needed to get over a solid screen."
"Elfrid Payton is hands down the worst starting PG in this league and its not even close. Frank is also trash, but have him play defense and sit in the corner on offense at  39% clip from 3. Even if Frank records 0 stats across the board, he would be doing exactly what EP does for the knicks every time he steps on the floor"
I will take any chance I get to make fun of elfrid Payton.
"Same, except elfrid Payton. I don’t consider him a true Knick. He has no passion for organization or what it stands for. He’s a bonafide scrub. 28% from 3 as a guard. Honestly, Rose should start over him."
The Elfrid Payton of centers
we really should be asking about the elfrid payton effect
The 2013 was made up of a lot of old old past their prime vets   Heck I think this current elfrid payton is fast enough to beat Raymond Felton
Deserved but I feel like Thibs should have gotten it. The Knicks willfully employ Elfrid Payton and the Suns only missed the playoffs last year because of injuries. They were like 5 games below .500
Congrats to him but no bias Thibs should have won. Give the Knicks CP3 over Elfrid Payton starting this year and they go undefeated.
"Elfrid Payton, liangelo ball, Eric Bledsoe, Andre Drummond and Jeff Teague"
I appreciate what Monty has done but he’s done it with a HOF point guard while thibs has done it with Elfrid Payton. That alone should be the difference maker.
what about the guy who is obsessed with elfrid payton
&gt;ELFRID PAYTON MVP  HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THEO PINSON LIKE THIS
how is elfrid payton still starting halfway through may?
One  of  the Knicks wins was when Austin rivers and elfrid Payton  were getting big minutes and another was when rose just got here.  It’s a 2 way street. Both teams are better now
"That's an incredibly stupid take. Patrick Ewing was a center, and didn't play the role of a passing threat.   The Knicks ran point guards out there and had the likes of Anthony Mason who was basically a point forward.   Julius Randle runs the offense because our starting point guard is Elfrid Payton.  You might as well look at Joel Embiid and say he's overrated because he doesn't pass as much as Julius."
Elfrid Payton with hops and worse defense.
Warriors treating Ja like he was Elfrid Payton
swatted Elfrid Payton twice as well :(
But we could have sga instead of Elfrid Payton lol
"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
&gt;THIBS FOR COTY   &gt;   &gt;RANDLE FOR ALL NBA SECOND TEAM AND MIP   &gt;   &gt;NERLENS NOEL FOR DPOY   &gt;   &gt;DROSE FOR 6MOTY   &gt;   &gt;QUICKLEY FOR ROTY   &gt;   &gt;ELFRID PAYTON MVP  YEEEEERRRRRRRRRRR
THIBS FOR COTY  RANDLE FOR ALL NBA SECOND TEAM AND MIP  NERLENS NOEL FOR DPOY  DROSE FOR 6MOTY  QUICKLEY FOR ROTY  ELFRID PAYTON MVP
Carsen Edwards is literally 5x better than Elfrid Payton
You must not have seen Elfrid Payton
aka Keith Bogans 2.0.  After Elfrid Payton fell out of the league he's going to be as assistant coach for Thibs.
Lol I like how this thread just accepts Elfrid Payton as the lowest bar for starting PGs
Knicks as well   Elfrid Payton &lt; Wall
We are going to start Elfrid Payton in the playoffs  Yes
Elfrid Payton. He's in the starting lineup. We win the thread
Knicks biggest issue is definitely their offense. They’ve been a good offense since April but only when Elfrid Payton isn’t in. And they’re very bad in crunch time
I guess our young guards are developing Elfrid Payton syndrome at the line
"Honestly, at this point I'm more than convinced that the front office promised Elfrid Payton a starting role and they're only leaving him be to reassure any future assets that our FO keeps their promises.     ...otherwise, I have no idea why we handicap ourselves so hard."
Elfrid Payton. To the point I had to bounce from Knicks reddit...among other reasons lol.
