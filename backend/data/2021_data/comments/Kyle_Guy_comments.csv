Who the hell is calling him black??? He’s THE whitest guy in the league. Corny ass Kyle Kuzma East
"Rooting for Malcolm to reach it again. He’s gonna end up being one of the most underrated players of all time.  Already hit 50-40-90 once. Most likely All Star this year. Quite honestly think he’ll lead (co lead w/ Sabonis) the pacers to a conference finals appearance at least. Dude won ROTY, won defensive player of the year in college. He’s done practically everything. And off the court man is a genius. Malcolm is a pure good guy. Has that organization for building wells in parts of Africa. I love that organization man, so many Africans have to walk so far just to get access to water which Americans take for granted. Build wells for them just beautiful. Joe Harris Justin Anderson Kyle Guy Garrett Temple. Tolliver. They are all involved with it, just a beautiful organization"
Morey's probably super high on Kyle since he's an analytics guy lol
"Anytime someone clearly takes a screenshot of a video but does not post the video clip, I ignore the point.  Still images never tell the story.   [Maybe they didn't post the Simmons video because doing so proves 100% Lowry didn't undercut him, and that Simmons jumped while Lowry was boxing him out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepdO3XSMMM&amp;ab_channel=CliveNBAParody).  But yeah, the guy who threw the elbow to the balls is the clean player in that sequence, gtfoh.  Also the Paul George thing being Lowry's fault is crazy to me, consider George falls and ends up taking Lowry with him (I'm not blaming George for it, he had no intention of bringing Lowry down, but I'm not sure how Lowry is supposed to avoid that).  First video is Gordon, already discussed.  Second (and third) video are a play on the ball, catches Beal in the head - flagrant, not dirty.   Fourth video, are you serious? How do you watch the last replay and call that play dirty?  Lowry is running for the rebound, sees Porter and tries to slam on the brakes to avoid contact, ends up clipping him.  How do you see any intent there?  Fifth video...yeah, a little.  Delly is being a pest and reaching/poking after Lowry calls the timeout, he's got his face deep inside Lowry's space, and Lowry gives him a little love tap.  There's no intent to injure or hurt Delly.  Sixth video...come on.  Really?  Not even dignifying that with a response, if you think Lowry is strong enough to throw LeBron like that.  Seventh video is nothing.    Did you just search ""kyle lowry dirty"" and post the first 7 links without checking what they showed?"
How else do you expect a 6 foot guy like Kyle Lowry to box out a giant like Aaron Gordon? Its not like Kyle intended to bump into AG's knee. Unfortunate that it happened but I just don't see the flagrant
How do you feel about Kyle Guy?
"I said i doubt detroit does the trade at the end of the post but a good reason being it fills out their roster more while they rebuild for the future. With more people coming back from Acl injuries relatively the same they would have a high level point guard that the roster is missing and a guy who can stretch the floor with his three point shooting, Dinwiddie is also nearing his prime so they could get 4/5 good years out of him and Harris while being slightly older he has the benefit on the 3 point specialist playstyle that could allow him to last as long as guys like JJ, ray allen, kyle korver have done recently. The pistons currently have the problem where they severely lack shooting besides Grant and an inconsistent blake griffin and this trade would fix that some."
I’m not saying it’s okay or how the game works... but lowering your shoulder into the guy who hurt your leg and ended your season is better than some random flagrant..  Even the play before Kyle hip checked Aaron’s knee and he had to go to the locker room. Most “justified” flagrant I’ve ever seen imo
TLC is the kind of guy you want to cheer for and once in a while he has a solid game then he immediately reverts to Kyle Singler.
"https://mobile.twitter.com/PapageorgiouMBO/status/1356048524497068036?s=20  Kyle Lowry isn’t a dumb guy, he has good body control and great awareness of the court. He knows what he was doing here."
"Even if Rose won MVP, It doesn't necessarily make him the better player. People love to overrate collections of stars and underrate well built teams which Chicago was.  Joakim Noah was a decent playmaker from the 5 (eventually became elite), maybe he doesn't score but it doesnt make him a bad offensive player. Luol Deng for the talent in 2011 is a pretty solid second scoring option. He had a versatile game, could score on/off ball hit midrange and the 3. Carlos Boozer was a money midrange shooter and very capable low post presence for the team. This is a guy who was averaging 20 points per game on Utah before coming to Chicago. Plus Kyle Korver and Taj Gibson.  Chicago won 60 games because they were a damn good team. Rose was by far the most important offensive player but he did not carry the entire Chicago Offense.   Dirk, Kobe, Lebron, Wade were all unquestionably better than Rose. I think Dwight and KD were also. And then as soon as the very next year, CP3 came in and proved he was still the best point guard in the league (he was coming off injury in 2011)"
He bullied Kyle Guy
Kyle guy is the goat. Needs to be unleashed
Not this game. I would say at least 2 of his calls against Kyle Guy were not legit. He got 5 more FT's than the entire King's team.
Good Guy Kyle Anderson
Kyle Guy looking like the better prospect . Which kinda blows my mind tbh
"I'm not sure whether the tech was justified or not because I don't know what was said, but my point is that it's either a tech or it isn't, whether it's 4 seconds in or 4 seconds left. I hate this idea that is perpetuated through the NBA and NFL (and probably other sports, but I just watch those) that there are some players on whom fouls shouldn't be called as much or some situations during which fouls shouldn't be called. If it's a foul, it's a foul. I don't care if you're LeBron James or Kyle Guy and if it's in a preseason game or game 7 of the finals."
Nah Trade him for Kyle Guy. Then you have Gay Guy(s) Love(s) SexLand
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
"Something people forget about Andre Drummond...  Kyle Lowry was not always Kyle Lowry. Kawhi was not always Kawhi. Hell, LeBron and Jason Kidd were not the shooters they later became when they were early in their career. It takes time to develop.   How do we know he’s even THAT bad of a shooter? Granted, his shooting is poor right now, but we’ve seen him take so few shots that we can’t say for sure that he’s really any worse than a guy like Giannis."
"I think this guy said Kyle Lowry was better than Westbrook last year, I highly disagree (last season)  But he's on point here"
"He's a great culture guy. Once Kyle took over as the main guy, the raptors started winning."
"Are you really going to say that the guy who didn’t want to be there and was only there for one year is a greater player for that franchise because he won them a ring? Kyle Lowry (and Demar) has been the heart and soul of Toronto for the better part of a decade, in fact he’s been there so long that causal fans probably don’t even remember that he played for Memphis or the rockets before landing in Toronto. If Kyle retires as a raptor I’m pretty sure he’s going down as the best raptor"
"What a stupid take on a guy who's only 24. Go look at what guys like Steve Nash, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Gary Payton, Chauncey Billups, etc. were doing at his age. Dennis Rodman is a HOFer who didn't even touch the court til he was a year older than Mitchell is now."
"At the start of the play, Zion is on Kyle Guy (UVA #5), Marques Bolden (Duke #20) is on Jay Huff (UVA #30), and RJ Barrett (Duke #5) on Hunter (UVA #12). Huff sets the pick to get Zion off Guy. Bolden then switches onto off Huff onto Guy, but Zion stays on Guy. In a typical pick and roll situation, the defender guarding the ball handler (Zion on Guy) and the defender guarding the screener (Bolden on Huff) switch after the screen is executed. Zion not switching onto Huff forces Barrett to switch onto Huff. That means he abandons Hunter, who's free to run to the three point line, leaving him open for the extra pass. The defensive recovery onto a guy who wasn't his man was great, but he only had to recover because of the initial error. OP asked why a player who was so good on defense in college and high school has struggled in the pros; it's because you can't pull off that kind of recovery in the NBA, so all that's left is the first error.   **Here's where, watching it again, I could have made a mistake**: I initially assumed Zion/Bolden were supposed to switch, but it could be that they were supposed to blitz Guy and the defensive strategy just failed. In that case, it's more of a blown play because of tactics, and not because of anything Zion did- not his fault at all."
"Kyrie ‘Kyle Kuzma’ Irving.   No but seriously the guy has been nothing but issues since coming to the nets, barely playing, starting controversies, leaving, it’s just annoying and if he doesn’t play absolutely flawless and win every night im gonna point the blame his way. Maybe unfairly at times but still gonna do it."
"Yeah I knew Toronto loved him. He was a fun guy to have on the roster, but he was pretty washed those last two years.   Kyle O'Quinn is another former Sixers center just floating out there too."
"The trade that would kind of make sense for both sides if Kyrie actually plays for Toronto would be Kyle Lowry and Chris Boucher for Kyrie.  Now that Harden’s here, Kyle may actually provide much more value than Kyrie for this team with his defensive intensity and leadership. Kyle won’t pout if he doesn’t get 10 isos a game like Kyrie.   Chris Boucher on the floor with Lowry, Harden, Harris, and KD would be straight up unfair on offence; with no one being less than at league average 3pt shooter.  Assuming Kyrie’s ok with playing out his contract in Toronto through 2023 (BIG IF), this gives Toronto a 2 year window to compete with Kyrie as the undisputed star and Pascal as a premium second option.  Who knows, maybe Kyrie now wants to be “the guy” to lead a team deep in the playoffs averaging 35 points a game."
"Oladipo isn’t a good fit in Philly. Needs the ball in his hands, playmaking is up and down, not an efficient half court shot creator, takes too many shots he’s not good enough to take, doesn’t complement Embiids skill set really at all. The Oladipo Simmons fit also is no good   Kyle Lowry is the guy who that kind of framework did a trade is something I would consider much stronger if Philly. Danny green mike Scott two protected firsts"
"I love the guy and have his Raptors Dino jersey in my closet, but Kyle Lowry should not be a Hall of Famer.   He's made 1 All NBA team his entire career and his All-Star Game Nominations are primarily a byproduct of him being in a conference with lesser guard play. There's no way he would've scraped all star teams playing in a conference that had Steph, Russ, Harden and Dame..."
"yeah and they're gonna make a playoff push with a 10 day guy, Kyle Korver, and Joakim Noah"
Kyle Korver will get a contract soon I bet. Plenty of teams need guys to come off the bench and drop dimes from 27 feet.   He can’t really play defense anymore and he can’t run the floor like he used to with Atlanta but if you’re down by 12+ and need someone to come in and erase that deficit? He’s the guy. Wish the Bucks still had him.
Trae Young because the media nuts every time he had a highlight like he’s a superstar but the dude will never be “the guy” on a good team. Also Kyle Kuzma.
"This sub if filled with dumbass 10 year olds who look for any and every chance to meme. Somehow a 6’11” guy not shooting 3s became the biggest meme on this awful sub because he’s listed as a PG on b-ref I guess. The Simmons/Embiid pairing on offense will never be perfect, but defensively it’s special and Simmons is a helluva player. I like the idea that’s been floated around of the Sixers trading for Kyle Lowry. He can be the primary ball handler in the half court and Ben can function as a something of a Draymond Green on steroids."
"Caris LeVert has been below league average efficiency every year since his rookie season. He just isn’t that good, and he’s not a young guy with a ton of upside anymore. Statistically, he a shorter, less efficient Kyle Kuzma with better playmaking."
"I'll state out front that this is an active debate among Raptors fans, but there is a growing number of us that believe in doing a 2019-2020 Warriors style rebuild, where we suck for one year to grab a talented young player.  We have 2 lottery picks on our team: Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. A lot of our players are really good (OG, Fred, Siakam, Kyle) but we don't have a #1 option and ultimately that puts a cap on our ceiling.  We're playing in f*cking Tampa Bay during a pandemic, where every game is an away game, we got off to a terrible start and have a team with fundamental flaws (e.g. our centers are unplayable, except Boucher who isn't a center), and we're probably looking at a competitive 2nd round series at best right now.  If we can dip into the lottery, grab a top 5 guy in this stacked draft, and then go back to being perennially competitive, I think it's a great move."
I have a feeling that Morey will swing an important deal. I’ve been always looking at Kyle Lowry.   He’s on an expiring contract so he won’t be expensive. He’s popular in Philly. He’s a winner and a leader that Philly doesn’t currently have. Plus he’s a guy that can create his own shot that Philly really lacks. I think he’s a better fit for them then Harden was with what they was going to give up factored in.
Dame been foul baiting every trip down the lane. I love the guy but that shit it cheap. Even Kyle doesn't do it on every fucking trip
Kyle is a funny guy. I remember he got into a Cavs huddle once and that prompted a classic Ty Lue meme face
"Haha fair, but that’s all I’m saying. Not changing anything, just adding or acknowledging SOMEWHERE that what he did was mind blowing for his era. He beat the next guy in his era by 49%. To put that in perspective, Ray would have had to make 3,648 threes to beat the next guy by the same percent (Kyle Corver because I’m not counting Curry as he’s still active)."
This kid reminds me of a Nova Kyle Lowry (when he was the quickest guy on the court).  Guy isn't scared of the moment and plays with such poise for a young fella.
"I’m not a guy that likes clichés like that but man he and Kyle are cut from the same cloth, he’s a certified winner."
Kyle saw the light after his first year in Toronto. He thought he was only here as a stop gap. He was just another guy in the long line of point guards brought in to take Jose’s place in that starting lineup but failed when Jose outplayed him (like he did every guard for nearly a decade). When the Knicks trade fell through (thank god) that’s when he committed to being a team guy for us.   That’s where the bond with DeMar formed and the rest his history. Now he’s the unquestioned GROAT.
"&gt;Who is “they” that told you this?  Fuck me if you're seriously going to claim that ""why didn't they comply?"" and property damage being a horrific crime that's worth killing over (Kyle Rittenhouse) aren't actual talking points. You living under a rock isn't an argument.  &gt;For instance, Do you think a guy that smashed a cops head in with a fire extinguisher is getting off Scott free? Really?  The lack of a police presence let him leave the scene. Try to imagine that happening during a BLM protest in the Capitol.  &gt;Point me to a place where you stood up publicly and denounced any of the rioting that occurred during any other protest this year and I will apologize to you.  I'm doing it right fucking now."
"I mean, what do you expect to happen when you charge a guy with a gun? Rossumbaum had It coming. The guy who got his bicep shot off also had it coming and he was carrying illegally as well but I bet you would have hailed him as a hero if he shot Kyle."
"Nope. Not in a playoffs series. And regular season is too hard to tell now. But based on the inconsistency of the core, nope. You are hoping a high pick is your savior but nurse doesn't play rookies heavily and he would need some time to develop. So no I disagree with you. This core is not gonna work and I rather do clean rebuild to give a fair chance of our pick to develop. Again...the championship core had kawhi, green, gasol and Ibaka and Kyle. If Kyle leaves this year. That's 5 key players you lost. This core is nothing without their vet presence. We have 1 vet and we are 1-6. Therefore, I wholeheartedly don't think this core is gonna work out. For everyone's optimism, let's hope they grow and eventually work out but right now, not a chance. Sorry guy, I just have to agree to disagree."
"Well from there I would hope we could find some auxiliary pieces in free agency. I think Pascal if he stays in that scenario would do better as the secondary guy again, so then it's just finding the crew who will work around them (and Kyle unless he decides to leave)"
"I wouldn't agree at all, he's basically in that same role of Kyle Korver/JJ Reddick/Joe Harris (not Bertans or Robinson those guys are more 3-dimensional) but as a guy who's just really good at shooting 3s and is an ok passer. Joe Harris is worth 4 years almost $72mil, meanwhile the Clippers extended Kennard for 4 years $64mil. Could end up backfiring I guess but this seems like a pretty decent contract imo.  Not to mention, he literally hit the game winner tonight that got waived off bc Bev got called for a loose ball foul lol, I'm certain his value is already being felt"
HOW DARE YOU DENY KYLE GUY A DUNK
Kyle guy looks like a 12 year old zoomed out
"Kyle Guy, Warrior killer"
How's Kyle Guy been so far this season?
"Ah beans, known Warrior killer *KYLE GUY* is in..."
Kyle Guy game winner again tho?
It's tough to say. Yes they did win a ring but kawhi was breaking down all playoffs.  I think you have the argument of saying the clippers may have been better on paper just looking at the roster while the raps would be a better team if that makes sense.  I think we wouldn't be having pascal problems either if he relegated to a legit 2nd or 3rd option and only had to live to that hype. Kawhi was great because for us we finally had that guy that can pretty reliably go out and get buckets when others are struggling like FVV or norm.  Right now the team is super reliant on lwory and at least two other players having a good game for it to even really he competitive. We also had a lot of depth with kawhi. Ibaka was another dude that could go out and get us a fairly reliable 15 a night. Gasol helped with playmaking so much to take load off kyle as well and not require FVV to facilitate as much.  Tbh that team was pretty fucking nasty when all the pistons were firing. Had the potential to smash any team in a one off game when it's clicking. I still don't think we beat a healthy warriors squad though just because of star studded that warriors squad was. Rockets came damn close too but weirdly I think we beat the rockets in that finals but that's a tough call to make.
Kyle Singler. Haven’t heard about that guy in a while but I see why now
and just a couple years ago I remember the same thing happening with some other guy. Kyle Kuzma or something like that
"Huh never would've known seeing as the NBAtv broadcast muted all basketball sounds. No whistles, no dribbling noises, just commentary from a guy that sounded like basketball Booger who couldnt stop repeating himself.   ""Did you know Kyle Lowry isnt a dirty player. I mean by no stretch of the imagination is he a dirty player. Its inconceivable to think hes a dity player because by no means is he a dirty player"".   This was real commentary from that game..."
There is a guy named u/TanBoots whose job is only to shit on kyle kuzma. Hes blocked me. I dont get why these people even exist. It's so sad.
"Kyle Lowry is an exception to the rule, and Harden has been in his prime for some time.  A guy that is 26 is unlikely yo get much better."
"&gt; They were considered busts until they went to other teams  Not by competent GMs they weren't. The Nets wouldn't have been willing to trade Brook Lopez and Kyle Kuzma for Timofey Mozgov's horrid contract if they thought they were getting a bust in D'lo as the sweetner. The Pels wouldn't have traded Anthony Davis if the centerpiece of the trade was a guy they thought was a bust.   The only reason these guys were considered ""busts"" is because Laker haters like yourself wanted to call them that, no matter how promising they looked or how well they were playing. Guys like you were saying shit like ""he's a bust"" from day one, and you never moved off that until they weren't on the Lakers anymore and then immediately your narrative changed to ""the Lakers fucked up by trading such a promising young player!"""
"Oh shit, rare Kyle Guy sighting"
He can continue his rivalry against Kyle Guy in Turkey.
Sixth man is definitely not how I would project Haliburton. His ceiling to me is a Kyle Lowry: elite glue guy and second or third scoring option on a championship team.
"Kenny was playing with hakeem and two other guys on the team scoring about the same, tough case to make a middling playoff team having multiple allstars, and even then he'd be 1 of 3 guys outside hakeem averaging around 17ppg so there's far from a guarantee he'd win.   Kenny's fun but he's not an allstar. In todays game he might be an allstar tbh. The talent is nuts but it's also diluted in a way where it's more about the character of the guy that determines his career than his college/hs talent. In todays NBA Kenny coulda been a Kyle Lowry type player but back then those players were probably more common. No disrespect to Lowry, it's not easy being an OG in todays world lol"
"the ""kyle korver for THREEEEE"" guy doing the in-stadium commentary is the best part of this entire night"
In some level I agree with that but my objection to that is o don’t think Kyle guy could afford to take a year off   I don’t think staff and lower coaches could afford to take a year off  And then rookies
"I have no idea.  I doubt his shooting will be affected terribly much, it's more his defense that I suspect will be where we see how well he's healed.  And, I think that way because I look at a guy like Kyle Korver who was slow as snot and still able to get his shot going when he was in his late 30's.  Klay's only 31, so I think he'll be effective on offense for a good while longer.  Of course, there's going to be a getting back into game shape period where he'll probably look rough for a bit. He doesn't have KD's size to lessen the severity of that period of time, so I think it'll be more pronounced than what Durant went through.  But Klay also has the benefit of not being all that big, so he shouldn't struggle as bad as DeMarcus Cousins did to get back into his groove."
"It's **by definition** what was happening. If you don't understand the term it's ok but don't embarrass yourself over it.  The ball got picked, Detroit had a guy down. Do you think Kyle perhaps has an incentive to break free asap here? He wasn't kicking towards his face, he was kicking over it...do you think Sekou has the span to reach the fucking megascreen? It's going to give at some point and that's what Kyle got out of it"
I just wanna say fuck Kyle Lowry. Dude punted a guy that just came back from having a concussion
"I watch like 15 basketball games a year so im no expert, but isn't shaq at least kinda right here? He was saying that not everybody who shoots a 3 is steph curry... right? Im trying to compare this to other sports like how in baseball not every hitter is given the green light at 3-0 and in hockey not every line has a guy that just sits in his office like ovi or kyle connor and waits on the one timer. Do teams with a weak 3pt % play the same way as the teams with more reliable 3pt shooters?  Right or wrong he's kind of an asshole to talk to her like a child as he did"
Kyle guy turned into klay thompson against the warriors
FREE KYLE GUY
Honestly maybe even Kyle Guy and Hassan Whiteside are more useful
"They have a few other end of benchers - Anthony Gill, Ty Jerome, Kyle Guy"
Its fun seeing knicks fans happy for once.   Even Clyde commentating. Kyle guy or whatever his name is came into the game and he's like i thought this guy was the ballboy lmao
You should. Kyle Guy is a reigning champion and national treasure
That's Kyle 'ball boy' Guy to you
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
I died when Clyde said he thought Kyle Guy was a ball boy
HIGHLIGHTS:   - Breen forgetting KP existed. feels innocent but dammit i want to believe that was sly slander.   -  We saw a UFO (Unidentified French Object)  - Clyde genuinely thought Kyle Guy was a ball boy  - Quickley absolutely dominated   - Dap Master Theo got some play time  - Alec “don’t call me Alex” “Future firsts” Burks
I imagine if they trade him he’d like to go to Philly all things considered but Kyle is too nice a guy to ruin his relationship with Toronto if they try to trade him to the Clippers or wherever
I’d honestly expect a guy like Kyle to take a pay cut to contend for another championship
"Kyle Lowry didn’t make his first team till he was 28. Lonzos not gonna be some perennial 8 time all star, but the dudes still on his rookie contract and has shown at his peak he can be a 20-22/8/8 guy with great defense which could be enough to get a couple."
"I’ve worked graphics and it’s extremely easy for something to slip on a live broadcast. Luckily, the technical director I worked with was amazing and would catch any fuck up before it went live. I’m not sure the NBA process but for me, it was just me and the director takes a quick look before going live. For starting lineups, you have to trust your graphics guy to get it right. Must have been mislabeled/not updated.   Also, a lottt of people I worked with in sports broadcasting HATE sports. or at least the sport they are working. It makes it so that you aren’t distracted or star struck(its annoying working with a fanboy). I was on headsets telling the camera operators to get a shot of Kyle oquinn I think. None of them knew who he was so I said the huuuge black guy with the big beard sitting Courtside. One cam ops (who was particularly inept) started recording a standing security guard. In his defense, it was a big black dude with a beard. Just not Kyle o quinn big"
"Shanahan was an offensive coordinator with the Falcons, not a head coach, but you're not doing yourself any favors pointing to that game either as it's a great example of his inconsistency and middling results. 1st half Shanahan was great, 2nd half Shanahan arguably cost them the game.   There's a pretty reasonable argument to be made that it was Shanahans offensive play calling when they had a huge lead, that allowed the Patriots enough time to come back and win. Almost zero was done to run down the clock or control the ball as long as possible and we know how the game ended.  And while we're on the subject of taking the Falcons to the Superbowl, so did Dan Reeves, as a head coach, a much more accomplished coach at this point and long retired, that gets very little respect on his name. Dan Reeves Falcons lost the superbowl to the guy who replaced him as head coach in Denver, none other than Kyle Shanahan's dad Mike Shanahan.  You're still missing the entire point though that Shanahan is a good coach, just not a bonafide no questions asked success that's completely shrugged off the term nepotism.  McVey took the Rams to the Superbowl and again also lost. But he at least has a winning record so far in career."
"Pretty good. Started off bad but we're playing more like ourselves now. Siakam has really gotten back to form and is playing like a guy deserving of a max contract, so that helps a lot. Beating Philly without Kyle last night felt amazing."
"Feel like he needs to play that Kyle Lowry role next to a guy of Kawhi's caliber like what happened in Toronto. Conley can definitely give it his all for one playoff run and be a true 2nd option to a championship team.   Actually, clippers could use a PG like him if things don't work out for the Jazz or Clippers this year."
"Kyle Lowry is very good. He will still be very good next season and maybe another after that. It will not be cheap to get him, even if you have to match the salary. I wouldn't want anything less than a young guy and unprotected pick."
"Kyle Lowry has a decent post game he’ll use when he’s guarded by a similar size guard. Maybe it’s less effective for a guy like JJ Barea, but for a stronger guard or a really smooth guard like CP3 or Kyrie it’s a viable option."
"I was expecting a double digit loss but close enough. This team is trash. Had a few players show up and rest fucked off.   Despite our sub constantly shitting on CoJo at least the man has showed up as of late.   Ever since Fox got national recognition, he's been playing like shit.   I don't even know what to call Buddy's situation. He's been slumping since after ASB last season, dudes a negative asset right now. We have to give up more assets to get rid of him.   Despite our subs adoration of Kyle Guy, he's trash. He offers nothing right now  Bagley and Jefferies at least played well, shame they're both on minutes restrictions."
Nate Robinson is 5’9 any trained fighter would beat him and Jake Paul would beat the fuck out of you the same way Kyle guy would sauce you up
"No Kawhi is above DD to me. DD flamed out in the playoffs year after year. Carter had an impact that reached across the league sort with his dunks so he impacted the game. Kyle has longevity and success. Having suffered through Hoffa, I'm gonna savor a guy who helped bring a title here."
Kyle Anderson this season has become the must watch tv guy on our squad instead of Ja. Dude can score from anywhere and get anywhere he wants with his unique version of bipedal movement.
"Meh. NBA Media is trash because they're lazy and vote for familiar names. And as much as that hurts a guy like Anunoby for All-Defense considerations, it also helps a guy like Kyle Lowry every time the All-Star game comes around."
"My guy you apparently want Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Mike Scott and picks for Kyle Lowry on an expiring with the hope that he will take a discount to resign.   You can take that nonsense elsewhere."
"Teams like the Nuggets and Mavs with playoff hopes but shitty defense would be willing to give some picks and young players for Smart. I could easily see a MPJ for Marcus Smart swap.  If we wanted to get crazy, I think Smart + tons of picks could land the Celtics Christian Wood (ik Rockets fans will crucify me, but you’d rather have 4 first rounders, trust me). I also think that picks + exception could get them a guy even as good as Kyle Lowry (not this exact player but a guy of that caliber and circumstance).  They could also benefit from a Steven Adams/Clint Capela, but I don’t know how realistic those options are.  Honestly, as long as the Celtics have two All-NBA level wings they will be competitive, but I doubt they could beat a defensive team like the Bucks or Sixers."
In college Dillon Brooks(the guy he was guarding) did something similar vs Kyle Kuzma in college https://youtu.be/JaqGtuxfLbY
"Role players on non contending teams get underrated.  For example a guy like Richaun Holmes is better than a lot of starting centers in the NBA.  Kyle Anderson is a great defender, a good passer/pnr operator and this year he's even shooting well on decent volume, he'd be a starter on a lot of contenders, but he's on the Grizzlies so nobody cares.  Valanciunas is better than he was on Toronto, but he's not on a contender anymore so nobody cares.  Justin Holiday is an elite 3&amp;D guy, legit one of the best in the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other end role players on elite teams either get overrated/overhyped (Beverley, Caruso, Horton Tucker, DiVincenzo...) Or some often get overscrutinized  (KCP, Danny Green,...)"
"Do you believe that was the only change we made?   - We got Marc Gasol  - Siakam became an all star / borderline all star caliber player   - Serge improved significantly  - We got a championship 3&amp;D starter in Danny Green  - Fred VanVleet was a lot better in the last 2 series  - We got a new head coach that understood positional matchups   In 2018 our offensive rating against Cleveland was fine. The issue was defensively, we had JV guarding Love, Serge Ibaka on JR Smith and DeMar (a guy who infamously couldn't get around a screen to save his life) guarding Kyle Korver. There's a reason those 3 shot 40%+ in that series and did shit all offensively  In the other series .  If Exchanging Kawhi for DeRozan was truly the only change we made, we lose to Philly 100%"
"""I know the leafs have statues of players. But it's an entire row, not just one guy. And let's be honest, the Leafs have a much deeper and illustrious history than the Raps, there's no disputing that. ""  Raptors have to start somewhere, and objectively Kyle Lowry is that start."
Kyle kuzma has reinvented himself as a hustle energy slasher guy and its the best
Kyle Guy was essential to the Virginia championship run a few years ago. Nice to see him get some minutes today!
I didn't realize the Celtics were trying to get Kyle Guy.
Fuck me kyle just effortless out there. Gonna miss this guy.
He's not playing the Kyle Korver role. He's playing offball at times then can benefit from LeBron's own gravity in order to initiate the offense too.  He's not gonna be just a catch/shoot guy. If you've watched Schroder in this Lakers offense he assumes main playmaker every once in a while.  Plus we're talking about what the possibilities are with Steph/LBJ vs Steph/Jokic.  The former is way better
"I guess I just fundamentally disagree. It's a fan event showing off the brightest stars in the NBA. Team success should have nothing to do with it. It's commendable that players come together and make it work and have a ton of success in terms of wins, but that's not the spirit of the event. Let me give you an example, in 2014-2015 the Hawks had four allstars. They had Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague, and Kyle Korver. They had a really good record and clearly they deserved multiple AllStars, but Kyle Korver had no business being an AllStar. That guy is the ultimate role player. Really really good at what he does, but not an AllStar. That's what I'm talking about. So the Jazz would really deserve to have Mitchell and Gobert. Conley is playing well, but his numbers are in no way deserving of an Allstar nod. So who else would they get?"
Who would you give his minutes to? Kyle guy?
"Genuinely, I never thought ‘Oh Kyle Korver is 6’7’, but at the same time I never thought he’d be anything below 6’4 either. I guess it’s just when you’re used to seeing super athletic, 6’7 dudes then that 6’7 white guy who shoots 3’s just seems small by proxy because he doesn’t jump."
"Fan Vleet was a bench guy, and Kyle is actually a great defender for his size.  However, let’s be honest..GSW is holding another trophy if Klay and KD don’t get hurt.   Finals W is a Finals W, won’t take it from you, but situations like that need specific breaks for everything to go right."
"McKinley Wright IV, from Colorado. 22 year-old senior point guard, at 6’0” and 196 pounds, he should have the size for the NBA- that’s roughly a Kyle Lowry type build. Wright was a great free throw shooter (84%) on one of the best free-throw shooting teams in the country. He only shot 30% from three, but the good free throw percentage and previous good three point shooting seasons suggest he should be fine in the NBA- even if three point shooting isn’t his bread and butter. He also had an assist to turnover ratio of 6:2, and really cut down on his turnovers this year. For a guy who’s floor seems to be solid backup guard and whose ceiling (IMO) is Grizzlies Mike Conley but slightly worse on defense, he’s getting surprisingly little buzz."
fun guy. isn't even a travel kyle grabbed the ball took two steps then dribbled...
I have seen Kyle Lowery take charges.  It is more like falling down and pulling the other guy on top of you.
"Compare wilt to a guy like Kyle Pitts who is coming out of UF in the draft and is being hyped as a generational transcendent TE prospect.  Physically, wilt is/was superior (which is no slight against Pitts, wilt wins this comparison against most people). Pitts obviously has a bit more polish as a player than say...someone like Vernon Davis who got drafted as a TE in 06 (or 07?) solely on his physical attributes. Wilt would probably be in that same category (not sure how much football he played), but I’m sure he could learn.  NFL drafts “raw” project guys all the time. If you’ve got the athleticism, they can teach you. Wilt would be a pretty dominant TE. Even if you never really asked him to block (might be hard for him to get low to get leverage being so tall), you could use him like a jumbo slot guy. Imagine a LB or S trying to cover him as he runs a go up the seam."
I was playing pick up this one time and the guy on the other team told me I play like Kyle Anderson... didn’t know much of who he was at the time but I figured he’s an NBA player so i was like “wow thanks so much man” !! I later saw his highlights and saw how slow he was and I was like... was it a compliment or not ???? Lol
"That's major facts. Or you get the guys who only watch the tournament thinking that ANY player who goes off should be a top 5 pick. I've seen it with Carsen Edwards, Donte Divincenzo, Kyle Guy, Garza, Juzang."
This guy really thinks Kyle Kuzma has reached his Prime
Kyle Lowry.  He is not the franchise GOAT. That would be the guy who won us a fucking ring.
"why didnt just rest Fox, not his night. play Kyle Guy and get the W tomorrow instead"
"I want Oladipo to make it work in Miami. His go-to guy days are probably over, but if he can be a solid 3rd or 4th option with great defense then having him resigned at 28 would be better than getting back into the Kyle Lowry sweepstakes"
"&gt; Anyone who has read my work knows I abhor cancel culture. However, I view hypocrisy and double standards as equally threatening to our society. The sports world has embraced cancel culture as aggressively and arbitrarily as Hollywood.  lol. This is the sort of concern trolling you often find here, when a player says something objectionable and suddenly the entire BLM movement comes under question.   &gt; NASCAR star Kyle Larson, who is half Asian, was fired by Chip Ganassi Racing last summer for using a racial slur during a live-streamed virtual race.  “Who is half Asian” and used the n-word. What does the fact that he’s “half-Asian” matter here? That doesn’t win you minority points. The guy who wrote the article seems to think this is all a video game."
"Responding to a few comments here: I was aware that it had happened to a couple of college sports teams a long time ago, I meant more along the lines of a pro team.  When it happens to a college team, it's devastating for the community and the family and the fans of that team, but I'd imagine that a pro team would be a lot more impactful nationwide because all these guys are so well known at this point. I mean, just think of how many guys you've heard of on some random team. The Blazers or Suns or whatever. Players, coaches, staff. Beat writers. All gone, just like that.  Not to downplay these college tragedies. It's awful obviously. But the reason Kobe's death was so impactful to a bunch of random people was that he was a part of people's lives, everyone had heard of him, everyone had watched him play. Think of an NBA team. Most of these guys, we have memories watching them in college, going on a run in march madness, something like that. We follow them on social media. They've been traded from team to team, if a guy like Kyle Korver or Jae Crowder or someone was in a plane crash that's several fanbases who all have memories cheering for the guy. Coaches, same thing. Again it's a tragedy when it happens to any team but I literally cannot imagine the fallout if it happened to an honest to god NBA team."
"but tbh Pelle was the last guy that I would have considered tbh, I would have rather seen Kyle O'Quinn back"
Kyle Guy could never
He definitely saw it coming and played along anyways. Good guy Kyle.
"This is incredibly emotional - love it, and so grateful to Norm (and the others for all the memories). Vital to the ring, vital to the Raptors for half a decade really.  Also love how he highlighted how key Demar was - the championship team, they'll always get their props, but Derozan can get lost in the narrative apart from being the guy who had to go to make us win. This shows why he and Kyle are 1A/1B in my book of Raptors GOATs though - just the mentoring of the players and the care for the city to go along with the all nba level play. Norm, FVV, Siakam, OG - all super tight with both those guys, Jakob too. Bosh and Carter did a ton for the franchise, but they didn't leave that sort of legacy in the team culturally (Vince obviously did in the city in general).  That matters, contributes to a positive culture that leads to winning (as did Casey)."
Who are your favorites? I enjoy buddha Tony C..the guy who plays cop Kyle pred...ramee. x can be fun at times but just getting into it really over the last month or 2  I like the drug arcs.not a fan of the gambling boring
"i've watched some kings games this season because richuan holmes is cool as fuck, and i wanna make the case that Kyle Guy is the worst player in the league. that dude fucking sucks at basketball."
honestly it’s a big part of why i like j kyle mann’s draft breakdowns. his comparable players tend to include scrubs that had a similar style. hones in on what they guy is doing over how effective it is
"A young rising player, maybe a player such as Mitchell Robinson or other young goons, I’m a raps fan and Kyle is my fav player and he’s got some left in the tank but he’s gonna decline from here, the best reasonable offer for the raps would be like Michael porter jr or another young guy"
Super tough because we just got a whole new bench and you could argue any order for 2-4  Fox  Barnes  Tyrese  Holmes  Bagley  Buddy  Delon  Terrance Davis  Metu  Kyle guy
"So this is how a self-confessed casual sees the Memphis list:  Ja Morant - Very nice player.  JJJ - Spider-Man’s boss?  Kyle Anderson - Did he QB the Bengals 40 years ago?  Melton - Did you mis-spell Milton?  I’ve heard of Milton.  I think he writes books.  JV - the announcer that used to coach?  Brooks - a second player-coach on one team?    Clarke - spent a season on the Lakers?  That one?  Tyus - GOT reference?  Banes - See “Tyus.”  Winslow - Honest first thought was “Kellen,” but I know this guy was a highly touted lottery pick at one point.    Not busting on Memphis.  Just pointing out how the uninformed half lives."
Yeah good thing we can cheer for the good guy Lakers and their homegrown talent of [checks notes] Kyle Kuzma and Talen Horton-Tucker
Dude isn’t Kyle Kuzma the only guy left from like 2017?
Of course it was they wanted a package like Kyle is a fucking hall of famer or something all the guy can do is take a charge and hit the occasional 3. Fuck outta here
"&gt;Masai respected lowrys wishes to play for a contender or stay w raps and everyone but lowry/masai seems cheesed lol  Yup, this exactly. So many salty Sixers fans acting like they were somehow entitled to our guy, and we somehow wronged them by not taking whatever they were offering.  Raptors Nation was always happy to keep Kyle. He's our GOAT. Go check the Raps sub, or Raps Twitter: the overwhelmingly majority are psyched and relieved that Lowry is staying.  Masai wasn't looking to do a favour for a division rival. He set a price, and no one met it, so Lowry stayed, end of story. No reason for Morey or anyone else to be salty about it."
"No player has improved their reputation more with a championship than Kyle Lowry. The guy has never been good in the big moments outside his first quarter in Game 6 of the Finals. Outside that, he rode Kawhi + FVV to the championship. Kyle Lowry has never been worth that contract he got."
Yeah sadly Kyle makes too much money and contenders don’t tend to have a lot of useless dead salary they can just give away. Sixers would’ve basically give up all their assets and significant depth to get this one guy
By a guy named Kyle
KYLE FUCKING KUZMA IS THAT GUY
"This conversation is wild. The Raptors aren't going anywhere this year or in the foreseeable future. Thats facts. When healthy with a tight rotation they could probably steal a 4/5 series but that's about it.   The Sixers are not going to have success in the playoffs with Ben Simmons as their primary ball handler/second option. This is also facts. We've seen this with Giannis as well and Ben Simmons is very much a poor mans Giannis.  I think this Philly team as constructed will be a tough out in the 2nd round. Miami, Milwaukee, or Boston can definitely beat them. Indiana, or a even a healthy Toronto might be able to upset them as well but I think that's unlikely.   If you think Ben Simmons is better than Kyle Lowry, particularly in the playoffs, I don't really know what to say to you. Philly should be all in on Lowry, especially if they can somehow keep Thybulle and Danny Green.   Ben Simmons is a quality starter but he's definitely overrated. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Devin Booker is overrated and that dude is a flamethrower. Khris Middleton is overrated and he's a 50/40/90 guy. Overrated does not mean bad."
"Because we'd like to have our most beloved franchise player ever stay with us and don't feel right dealing him for literal shit offers to rival teams so they can win a chip?   I fully believe we could win a 7 game series against any team not named Brooklyn, and while I don't think we're title contenders, I think maintaining a winning culture is much more important than a 2nd round pick and/or some guy who's going to be our 8th man off the bench. We have a hard enough time getting people to play for us already, god forbid we become a losing franchise again.  This is also assuming Kyle walks in the offseason, which everyone seems to assume even though there's nothing but baseless speculation backing that up. Too many people think like 2k GM's and act like if you don't have 6 all stars you should blow it up and sell everything for ""the future"" even though most teams who do that end up in the basement for decades+."
"kyle lowry/jerami grant/lonzo ball/harrison barnes are the best players that could be traded. Barnes could net two picks maybe more depending on what is being returned. Lowry is probably the hardest guy to gauge, but a couple firsts would probably be in order. Ball probably gets trade for a young piece + picks if pelicans don't plan on re-signing him. Grant probably nets a couple picks + salary filler."
That guy Kyle Kuzma
&gt;How isn't Wiggins good enough to be a 3rd guy? He's better than Eric Gordon who used to be the Rockets 3rd option or Kyle Kuzma.  Because he was a bad 3rd guy with us in 2017-2018? And that he's not really an efficient scorer.
How isn't Wiggins good enough to be a 3rd guy? He's better than Eric Gordon who used to be the Rockets 3rd option or Kyle Kuzma.
"&gt; I feel like this is pretty light considering had he said the N-word  depends on the context . There are plenty of celebrities and white athletes that have said the N word and not lost their contracts or have even been fined (especially in the NFL)      There was an article when Donald Sterling got caught trying to argue that almost all the nba players say it and then another article [pointed out](https://houston.cbslocal.com/2014/04/30/sports-expert-nba-players-saying-n-word-during-games-doesnt-compare-to-sterlings-racist-remarks/) that the players view it as trying to rile up an individual and not towards their entire race as   &gt;i n locker rooms, I’ve never heard a player use it in a negative manner and to some it’s similar to saying brother or friend.    I've never played in the NBA but on the street/ in schools/colleges people definitely say the n word on the court.      I know it doesn't represent *every* white guy in the NBA but [kyle korver had that blog post about his thoughts on](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/kyle-korver-utah-jazz-nba) Thabo's case with the NYPD, racism and supporting his teammates.       It really is going to come down to who says it and if they meant it as a slur or one of those awkward ""I thought we were cool enough to say it """
"Then explain how CP3 at #5 while putting up worse stats? Bc like Kyle, he’s a guy who’s stat sheet doesn’t tell the whole story. Just a winning player."
"That’s not the greatest thought process. Kyle Lowry was a bench player, Harden was just a guy that came off the bench for OKC, and Steph had glass ankles in the early part of their careers."
"In what way was Grizzlies roster awful last year? They started Valančiūnas, who is a double-double machine, JJJ - 7-footer who shot 40 % from three, Crowder who is a solid 3nD guy and Brooks, who had a career season that year. Plus their bench was deep aswell with the likes of Clarke, Tyus Jones, Melton, Grayson Allen and Kyle Anderson who all proved to be solid contributors in their NBA careers."
"That’s not what we signed Kawhi to do though. We signed him to be our mercenary, a guy who can get us shots when no one else can. Kyle is our creator. We had a perfect system in place, with everyone’s role very well defined. Throw Kawhi in a playmaking position in that year and we lose."
Is Paige Beuckers really Kyle Guy in disguise?
"This. There are some ways you can make a case but it all boils down to the Spurs having invested development time and roster construction around their youth, they are not going to deviate from that for a guy like Lowry. No shade at Kyle but he's on the back half of his prime and doesn't put the Spurs over the top. Its a poor move if they have to give up assets and doesn't address any needs going forward.   The Spurs have a log jam in the backcourt/wing so swapping assets to balance that as part of an LMA/Lowry deal is I guess somewhat plausible but what does Toronto have they'd be willing to move that the Spurs want and didn't already acquire in the Leonard deal?  For Lowry on a personal level, he already has a ring and certainly he'd want another but reuniting with Demar and playing for a solid organization would be attractive."
"&gt; The Spurs had the greatest PF of all-time and the second greatest player of the 21st century thus far. The Bulls had the greatest scorer in league history. The Lakers had prime Kobe, one of the best scorers in league history and a top 12 guy all-time. The Warriors had Steph, and while he wasnt a designated elite playmaker, him and Dray are definitely both way better playmakers than a guy like SGA lol, and their system was specifically tailored to put Dray's playmaking to use  Bruh if you don’t have a top 5 player in the league then you don’t really have a chance at a championship  so that goes without saying.   Warriors didn’t design for dray lol - they used all their bigs(Bogut, Lee specifically) as playmakers/screeners on the elbow and Draymond was the best among them - the load was still distributed between him, steph, iggy, bogut, Livingston to an extent too.   &gt; The last team to win without a clear top 15 player of all-time? 2019 Raptors with an elite playmaker in Kyle Lowry.  Depends on what you mean by elite - lowry never was a floor general type even though he’s a great playmaker. They had FVV, Marc Gasol, Kawhi and Siakam all avg 3+ APG.   &gt; Before that, we have the 2011 Mavs because you can argue Dirk isn't top 15. Elite playmaker in Jason Kidd.  &gt; Before that, we have the 2008 Celtics. You could make an argument for KG in the top 15 ig, but definitely not close to clear. Anyway, Rondo was an elite playmaker.  Bruh what are you trying to say? It goes without saying that without an MVP level player no team has a shot at a chip. An elite playmaker isn’t gonna move the needle much if you don’t already have superstar talent.   &gt; These teams obviously had multiple guys that can create offense for others. But they also have a primary playmaker who they can trust the most. The type of the thing the 2020 Clippers lacked. And if you don't have one of the greatest players ever to carry a greater load, you're probably gonna need a good floor general.  If you don’t have a legitimate superstar, then a floor general won’t help your championship odds much either way. I assumed that didn’t need to be said."
"Yeah, when your team has a particularly extraordinary player.   The Spurs had the greatest PF of all-time and the second greatest player of the 21st century thus far.

"Come on kings, get Kyle Guy to play at the level he does against the Warriors"
"If we are to judge who’s truly forgotten based on who is *not* being mentioned yet, recent multiple time All-Stars since 2010 include:  * Luol Deng  * David Lee  * Deron Williams  * Roy Hibbert   And for some head scratcher “*that* guy made an All-Star team?” picks:  * Gerald Wallace  * Chris Kaman   * Jeff Teague  * Kyle Korver"
favorite player: russ  i probably play like Kyle Guy or Nate Wolters except if they were 5’10 and amateurs
"That’s not what I’m saying though,  Think of John Stockton as Kyle Korver, and think of Magic Johnson as Stephen Curry   Now Kyle Korver is an incredible shooter, you can’t leave him open, he’s consistent and is going to get the job done    Stephen Curry is also efficient but is a better shooter because of his versatility he can knock it down on ball of ball, if you need a shot to go in no matter the circumstances, Stephen Curry is your guy.    John Stockton is the efficient, skilled get the job done guy, like Korver with his shooting   Magic Johnson has the wider range of passing ability wether it be in a system, flashy passes, lobs fast break he’s the guy that is going to be able to make that pass, like Curry with his shooting"
Does anyone actually know why the Bulls gave him that deal? Like did the front office seriously think trying to develop a guy with no skills and didn't play was worth keeping over idk literally getting anyone else? Reminds me of when the Thunder signed Kyle Singler to a 5 year deal after being a bust in Detroit. Why do that to yourself?
"He dominated the league until he got ""sick"". Even after ball, he's a freaking billionaire now. He's not only won, but dominated in every aspect of life. Even as a dad, his kid is a lil different, but is also a huge success. Dude people hated him cuz he was black and Bird was white Jesus; they hated him cuz he got hiv; they hated on him when he did the MJ video ""Remember the Time""; they've hated on Magic since he was here at State. But he's done nothing but make every one of his haters eat their words. The guy rebuilt the Lakers back to relevance. Do you think any other GM could have got Bron AND AD to LA? Granted he traded away his team but it paid off in spades. He made the craziest trade in my life time. I've seen crazy trades like the Cowboys and Herschel Walker trade, bit I've never seen a team trade not only leverage their starting line up but their future in all their draft picks as well. There was like 8 or 9 assets going to New Orleans for 1 player. Who coulda been a 1 year rental. He did whatever it took. And after he secured the greatest player of this generation from his hometown. Bron coulda went anywhere, especially the Knicks, and had more commercial success. But magic sold him on L.A. and Showtime. I truly believe Magic resigned the way he did cuz the Lakers were gona get shit dir how he did it, tampering and all that. So instead of having the Lakers take the hit, he took it cuz he could afford it. And it legit rolled off his back like water off feathers.   The Lakers got their guy and they won a ring. Regardless what batteries in the next 5 years they're ahead. I'll bet every team, not named Brooklyn, would give up their next 5 years for a ring this year. Like spend 5 years at or around .500 of you gave them a ring this year. They'd all take it.   So Magic is a winner there in my book. Had Palinka got the trade done giving up less than Magic offered originally, id say he jus planted the seed, but the trade was exactly what Magic said. Ya he did it with no regard for people's feelings, especially the young guys, but you gotta remember the NBA he came from, which was brutal. I mean if you watched the Jordan documentary, the Bulls  had Michael Jordan and they were like you're opinion don't matter were trading Scottie. If they did that to the biggest asset in the league, not jus the team but league, as they didn't care,  they absolutely won't care bout people like Lonzo Ball or Kyle Kuzma.   I can say with absolute certainty that Erving Magic Johnson is the greatest point guard to ever play the game. And that's from a Bad Boys Pistons fan. I know its blasphemous, but i think even Zeke would concede that.   If you're too young or jus never seen it, do yourself a favor and YouTube the Bird v Magic rivalry, cuz that will, ever be duplicated. Never! Im not trying to exaggerate, its seriously the best basketball you will ever watch. Period. Nothing comes close. The closest we ever came to since then was the Shaq and Kobe Lakers vs The Duncan, Parker, Ginobili San Antonio Spurs. But that still doesn't even come close, cuz Bird and Magic met in the finals in college and the NBA. Whenever they met or was all on the line. And both dominated their conferences with great teams. Even with freaking Kareem and James worthy and them boys on that team, Magic was Showtime! You watched cuz of Magic and what crazy shit you were gona see..."
Not sure if Kyle Lowry wants to stay “on the road” after his playing career is done; but the guy is very smart and able to connect with players. He would definitely make a good coach (at least as an assistant).
Kyle Guy looks like he drinks milk right from the cows udder.
"Kyle Guy, Louis King, and Jahmi'us Ramsey aren't injured though."
"“The biggest thing is he’s a super-positive guy,” Nurse said ahead of the NBA All-Star Game in February. “He’s the guy sitting next to me when I’m sensing disaster going on in a game and he’s saying, ‘We’re gonna win, we’re gonna come back.’ Constantly, ‘We’re gonna do it, we’re gonna come back.’ And that helps me out quite a bit.”  Kyle Lowry, who can be harder to please, was succinct in his praise.  “I would say he is the fucking man,” Lowry said.  ""Nate is the [expletive] man,"" said Raptors guard Kyle Lowry. ""He's always that positive, happy go-lucky [guy], always looking at the plus side, not looking at anything negative. We need that.""  Lowry is not alone. Fred VanVleet called Bjorkgren “one of the best” and called rumours he could head to Indiana “well deserved.”  ""I think Nate's fun,"" said Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. ""I hear him all the time in my ear talking about something. Every morning he'll say hi to you and give you a dab. He's present and I think his energy is felt and needed on this team. He's a great guy to have, a great coach and somebody who is a likable person and so serious about his job.""  u think people here just made things up and ran with it? lol"
"I'm saying this line of thinking is ridiculous. Put an all star point guard on any of Lebron's teams, and his role will adjust because he's not a Point Guard, he's a SF able to facilitate and control the play, he's smart. He's not a point guard. He's just as able to switch to being a PF / C because of his build.  There's a reason a 6' ft tall guy can't play C, even if some small guys are freaks of nature able to somehow guard Centers, that doesn't mean they're a Center. Height is a required talking point in basketball, even if fans want to pretend that isn't true.   Play styles are 100% evolving, and I'm not arguing that in the least. But it's basketball, and height will always be a factor, especially on defensive match ups, so you can't just ignore positions because of evolving play styles. If Kyle for instance, went to the Lakers during the trade deadline, Kyle would be the Point Guard for that team, because Lebron is not a Point Guard, he's a wizard able to play tons of positions. But Kyle is a Point Guard, and yes, his size and passing ability and court awareness put him in that position."
"I think you're really just underrating the trajectory KAT was on until last season. The guy was right there with Jokic and Embiid as MVP caliber centers until he finally got injuries and went through some awful personal stuff.   This is by no means a slight on Edwards, he has completely outperformed my expectations at every step since being drafted and I'm extremely high on him now, I just think KAT has game breaking spacing at the 5 that makes everyone around him better. Check out [these](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612750&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1626157,1630162) stats. KAT makes Edwards life that much easier. Its not a coincidence that Edwards back half of the year has been so amazing, KAT just makes everyone better just by being on the court. Most teams primary rim protector is completely helpless.  I can definitely see a path to Edwards being better than KAT, I just think, despite the explosive games he has, his inconsistency and lack of polish right now means it will take a bit longer to get there. Take a look at J. Kyle Manns breakdown and you'll kind of see. And I say this as someone who has watched a TON of wolves games this year, mostly because I believe in them like crazy. People have just forgotten too quickly how special KAT can be"
What were your thoughts when Kyle Guy and Justin James started the 2nd quarter for the Kings?
"Absolutely, anyone who says otherwise is hating. He was the cornerstone and face of a franchise for what feels like a decade. How is that not Hall of Fame? The bar isn't exactly super high to begin with. He's not a first ballot guy but he deserves to be in.  Could you tell the story of the NBA without mentioning Kyle Lowry? No. He is HOF."
"About to drop some knowledge on you from a different thread, please hold:  I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""

Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world.

Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history.

"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
"Trae and Kyle Lowry aren't dirty players, they just flop. This guy flops even more."
I fucking love J Kyle Mann. Best guy on the Ringer hands down.
"This is more like when Kyle Lowry got his opportunity. He was awesome in Houston but they were enamoured with Kevin Martin for some reason and didn't put the ball in his hands. Then he went to Toronto and his first full season they got rid of that boat anchor Rudy Gay, put the ball in his hands and he was was immediately Kyle Lowry. If you got to the game logs you can literally see where they changed the offence and he immediately starts filling it up. He was always that guy."
"Kyle Korver reminds me of every football jock from every high school movie.   Example, the guy from the OC. Thad from Blue Mountain State"
"Guy I replied to said this so I responded:      ""Which one is those will be a free agent this off season or will be disgruntled and wanting a trade?  Don't expect the Warriors to overreact.""   \---  What are you expecting to get for Wiseman. The guy above me said he wanted an all star that was coming off a contract or had team control for the future so I suggested Kyle Lowry, because he ticks all of those boxes despite the fit being a bit ugly and having to play Klay as a SF.     He's an all star/HoF type player. He brings parts of the game that Curry doesn't have. He plays SG. He impacts winning.     I don't think the haul is really that much considering we'd be giving up Lowry+ swapping picks. I'm not sure how much yall value Wiseman but you'd likely be getting one of our younger players as filler.     Reason I suggested Lowry and not cause it's fair is because others in the thread have suggested that Wiseman has negative value because he's a high school prospect C. Raptors are a C needy team, and Wiseman fits the core's age (GTJ/OG/him are all relatively in the same bracket.""     &amp;#x200B;  Lowry isn't disgruntled but he's okay with being traded, he's a free agent at the end of the season and he's relatively the same age as Steph Curry and would definitely help them win assuming they could find a real center to pair with them. Or am I wrong. Cause Steph/KLow/Klay/Dray/X piece looks pretty damn good to me. I hesitated throwing Siakam or Fred in but the trade would make a lot more sense if we threw Siakam in but now the salaries are even more convoluted and matching is much harder. Do we throw you guys Siakam+Fred for Wiseman+Wiggins? We definitely wouldn't be swapping picks anymore, and you're gonna have to tag some future ones on because that would signal a full scale rebuild in Toronto around OG.     We can discuss that things but the salary starts approaching 85M if you start including our star players. Would you guys want Fred instead? I'm not sure the answer there, because Fred doesn't tick the disgruntled, free agent superstar but we do control him - he's not a hall of fame talent and he hasn't made an all star game.     You guys aren't getting Beal for Wiseman+Wiggins and a first that may or may not convey. It's gonna take more than that. I don't think that package gets you a superstar."
I can't remember wishing for a guy to not get dealt at the trade deadline more than I did with Kyle this past deadline
In a game with Kevin Durant kyrie Irving Kyle Lowry siakam and ffv MIKE JAMES was the guy who took over in the 4th.   I don’t wanna see the raps ever again gg
"I’d disagree and I’m biased but context makes Rose’s mvp really impressive. Comparing MVP cases year to year is idiotic in the first place but I’m really sick and tired of people who never watched the NBA that year talk down what a player he was.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.

He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""

Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world.

Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader.

Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
What did we do to Kyle Guy?!
I swear if Kyle guy becomes a god again I give up.
All we need is Kyle Guy to get involved
"I didn’t realize you were trying to stretch it this far.  They literally say it was the starting package for PG. The Thunder wouldn’t just throw in Westbrook for free. Neither of the quotes you said say that the Thunder offered PG and Westbrook for the offer you said in the post, just that there was a trade package built around George and Westbrook. It would have had to at least include Kyle Lowry also, and probably another filler and another pick or two.   The contracts for the trade you listed literally just don’t work.   But yeah, I’m sure Prest, one of the best GMs in the league said “hey Raptors, here is this solid offer that is pretty fair and contracts match. Oh, you don’t want that? Alright, I guess we will throw in the guy that won MVP the year before and still an All NBA/All Star player even though the salaries don’t match at all!”  Just use some common sense bro."
"Okay, so mean is not an advanced metric. It is literally the most basic statistic ever. Mean is when you add all individuals in a data set and divide by the total number of data points. It's the average. We learn it in 6th grade. Outliers are the ones that are farthest to either end, ones that don't fall in with the rest of the data points. These are basic concepts, not advanced metrics. Beyond that, the 3.5% metric was me using the exact same metric you did in the previous comment when you said he wasn't top 15. You can't gatekeep the use of data, even data based on guesses, so only you can make any up.   The whole reason Kyle Lowry was brought up in the first place is how he plays defense on Steph. He holds off ball, gets in his landing space, undercuts him and pushes when the refs aren't looking, similar to how Dellevadova and others play against him. He is by no means the only or the first player to do it. In that scenario, he plays illegal defense which can result in injury (in this case minor scratches and gouges, ankle strain and sometimes worse). In any case, it's kinda dirty. Beyond that, there have been more than ""a dirty highlight or two"" to prove Lowry's reputation. The first commenter brought three up off-top and a whole thread filled with other examples (some video, some admittedly anecdotal). I'm not trying to say he's the dirtiest player on earth, he's no PatBev or Delle, but he's made enough dirty plays to warrant the label of 'dirty' by most of the fans who's team he plays against.   As a raptors fan (I'm guessing, no flair), of course you would die on this hill, I get it. I was basically a Zaza apologist for like a half-season. I thought Draymond's foot was trying to make a play for like a year. The thing is, it wasn't up to me, and I isn't up to you. You hold inherent bias toward your guy, just like every fan. The greater public (albeit the gutter-dwelling public of r/nba) has given him the label already, and that's that. Keep arguing if you want, the court of public opinion doesn't change their mind very easily."
"Lmfao you just tried to whip out advanced metrics to make your garbage claim. I said that to illustrate that there's a hugeass list of guys you need to inspect before coming for Kyle. Is he involved in some dirty plays? Yes, you could find a dirty highlight or two for pretty much any guy in the league. Dudes like you think Solomon Hill is dirty for accidentally hurting Bron"
"Ya I might give you that one, especially cause Kyle always has a bit of that tough guy kinda persona up, so when he lets that guard down and laughs/smiles it brings me pure joy"
"/u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show *(featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament)*.   MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose *(the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06)*.  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT *(14-25)* on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's *(ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans)*. That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers *(and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots)*.  **26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG%** Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer.

Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. [Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.](https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rose-dwarfs-other-improvements-with-defense/?_r=0)  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection.

"Getting our (now 2nd) best shooter back will be so huge for us! Kyle has been a lot better from 3 than in the past, but that still is only 34%. Jaren is a great shooter, and that'll really open things up for Ja. Jaren also gives us a guy not named Ja who passes the eye test in the clutch, which we've been really struggling with recently. Hopefully some nice Jaren daggers can bail us out in close games and we will stop losing them all!"
"This guy is averaging 3.7/1.9/0.9 and has an OBPM of -2.8  I get that defense is where he makes his impact, but he gives you literally nothing offensively. Kyle Lowry is still a plus defender at his age, and would've given positive offensive impact."
"WB was always playing at an MVP level though, I remember when SA played them he was the guy Kawhi was dueling against while KD was just sniping points against Green or an exhausted Kawhi and players like Kyle Anderson, remember that?"
The NBA wanted us to trade this guy for a 35 year old Kyle Lowry.🤦🏾‍♂️
Don't forget Kyle Lowry was 26 when he got to Toronto as well. Some guys are just late bloomers. Obviously don't expect Yuta to get to kyle's level but he can develop into a great help defender and if his shot keeps improving can turn in to an elite 3 and D guy kinda like a younger Jae crowder but a couple inches longer.  Seth is the perfect example needed the right opportunity to break in to the NBA.
"If you're looking for a serious answer:   **Price:** CoJo wasn't moving the needle either in a season that was already lost. He is way overpaid at $12.5M next season, so we weren't bringing him back regardless, which would mean eating his \~$2.5M buyout. Wright is under contract next year at $8.5M, so we essentially picked up a veteran backup PG for next season at 1yr/$6M (the net of Wright's deal after CoJo's buyout). That's half the price of CoJo. It's not a huge acquisition, but it's unlikely we'd sign a better backup PG in the offseason for less than $6M, given Sac isn't a free agent destination.  **Fit:** It allows our young guys to play off a real NBA PG when De'Aaron is out, rather than a G-League or 2nd round guy. It takes pressure off Haliburton to immediately step in as the only other playmaker on the team if De'Aaron has any injuries. It also leaves 3 legit guards in our rotation if we trade Buddy, giving us extra flexibility even if we don't use our '21 1st on a guard.  **Picks:** The cost was two 2nds. One was the Lakers '21 2nd, which is starting to improve because of their injuries, but will likely still end up in the 50s where the chances of getting an impact player are like 1 in 100 (seriously, look back at the last 10 years of 50-60 picks if you doubt me). The other was the Kings 2024 2nd, which is far enough out that it's hard to know if it'll be a 30-35 or a 50+. In addition to that reasonable cost, we already have 4 2nd round picks from the last two drafts that we don't play (Jahmius Ramsey, Robert Woodard, Justin James, and Kyle Guy), PLUS we have all our own 1sts &amp; 2nds from '21-23 with a bonus 2nd in '22. We just can't develop all those prospects at once while prioritizing Fox, Hali, Bagley, and the '21 1st. So we have to use the extra picks to add cheap value like Wright."
"He was also a great locker room guy on the Raptors. He's close friends with Kyle and Demar  That was an underrated era of the Raptors, Amir Johnson, Demar, Kyle, Rudy Gay, TRoss, PPat. Surprisingly fun team."
What? That doesn't answer my question. Do you think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs right now? Do you think Alen Smailagic is better than Evan Mobley right now? Paul Reed better than Jalen Johnson? Kyle Guy over Davion Mitchell?
"I probably shouldn't have used Jokic as an example, defense is absolutely critical at the center position. But I didn't want to list a 3rd guard like Dame so I tried to think of a wing or a big lol. You're going to go far in the playoffs if you have a great team, Harrison Barnes' defense was irrelevant for the Warriors. Kevin Love's defense was irrelevant for the Cavs, Kyle Kuzma's defense was irrelevant for the Lakers. One guy being bad on defense doesn't sink your team, it literally doesn't matter as long as the coach can put that guy in a position where he isn't getting attacked on every possession."
ye Kyle is actually a solid player for his draft position but just not the right guy for a contender
When will FO’s stop overpaying these one-dimensional shooters that can’t defend??   And Harris isn’t even one of those guys that can bomb running off screens like Kyle Korver. Guy is slow as hell with a slow ass release.   That Bob Myers quote needs to be ingrained into some of these GM’s.
"I think it will be a guy with Joe Harris/Kyle Korver/George Hill that one year on the Bucks type efficiency while being a generational talent with a longer prime. So I feel at some point someone shooting high 40s on high volume will hit the stage and that player will have entered his prime a bit earlier than Curry. It'll probably be a taller player with Curry's talent, enabling him to have an easier time shooting over people while having the same touch. That being said I wouldn't be surprised if it took 20 years for this person to appear since Curry's volume and accuracy is pretty much unmatched atm, even guys like Lillard don't actually come close. I think Curry will be the King of 3s for quite a while"
How many times has he even said that? Always boggles my mind that so many raptor fans are assholes to Kawhi. Guy took renowned playoff choker Kyle Lowry as his his second best player and won the only championship in team history
"It's not the same. Typically when you talk about a shot creator it's more like a guy who can handle the ball and create a shot for themselves. I guess I could have been clearer.  Think about the role Jimmy Butler used to play for Philly.     Of the guys you listed below, Tobias is really the only passable example you guys have and he's decent not elite.   Elite offensive teams have multiple guys who can put up 15-30ppg mostly scoring off the dribble.  1. Giannis, Middleton, Jrue (and even here, Middleton is often their best half-court shot-creator over Giannis)  2. Durant, Harden, Kyrie  3. Westbrook, Beal  4. Donovan, Conley, Clarkson, Bojan, Ingles   5. Dame, CJ, Powell  And it becomes a lot more relevant the deeper you go into the playoffs because the game slows down and you lose a lot of other scoring opportunities.   Philly is pretty short-staffed in that regard and it means Embiid has to do more on his own because he can't just give the ball to someone and let them lead while he has a break.  * Simmons struggles in the halfcourt * Tobias gets stopped too easily * The shooters need help getting their shots off  &gt;We have a lot of shot creators with off ball movement  You need additional scorers who are more than glorified wide receivers who 'make plays' by getting open.   &gt;second half it wasn’t there  That's because the game is slowing down.  Typically basketball slows down later in the game and later in the playoffs. When the game really slows down is when you really need shot creators.  This is why Philly keeps hitting these invisible walls after looking dominant all season and in the 1st round.   It's also why Kyle Lowry was such an exciting trade prospect for Philly this season. Replacing a shooter or two with a guy who can shoot **and** create would have had a huge impact on your half-court offence."
Why does Niang play? Guy is worse than Kyle Kuzma
"mpj doesn't want to switch, doesn't close out, doesn't box out, and doesn't have handles to get to the paint.  to think kyle kuzma let this guy cook the shit out of him."
"&gt;Lmao you need to stop copying and pasting that absolute nonsense.  Then you need to provide some reasonable argument to counter it.  &gt;Guy had the nerve to say a team that missed the playoffs  If you aren't knowledgeable enough to know that players were injured, and that players often improve with age in general, you really should just remain quiet, rather than embarrassing yourself.  &gt;A team with fucking Kyle Kuzma starting and KCP and Green two of the most inconsistent offensive players in the entire league.  If they traded for Butler instead of Davis, Kuzma isn't starting, and neither are Caldwell-Pope ( probably gone in the Butler trade ) or Green.  They are deep on the bench, where they are some of the best bench players in the league.  Again, if you are totally unaware of the facts of the situation, it would be best to clam up."
Lmao you need to stop copying and pasting that absolute nonsense. Guy had the nerve to say a team that missed the playoffs the previous year would’ve easily won it the following year. A team with fucking Kyle Kuzma starting and KCP and Green two of the most inconsistent offensive players in the entire league.
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
"I think they are similar as you can give them the keys to the team but not necessarily be the best player on the team. Kyle Lowry is another guy I think of that fits that mold. But if any of those guys are the best player on the team, or on a team without much depth, they likely aren’t a playoff team."
this guy has a vote but dudes like Seth partnow don't? this stuff kills me. I'd give j Kyle Mann and Ben taylor ten votes before Im okay with this idiot voting again.
"Yeah, they’re going to get Kyle, the guy who always takes the highest contract offer, for an MLE. Then, they will convince the Spurs to give the rights for Derozan for Kuzma and Trez, while signing Kuzma and Trez to 3 or 4 year contracts. I’m also pretty sure sign and trade has to be 1 for 1"
The thing tho is Middleton gets trashed every year in the playoffs because that’s when people finally see him play. Giannis may have been a 2 time MVP but I don’t think people watch the Bucks enough to see the rest of the team play   And that’s not to say Middleton is bad because he clearly isn’t. But if the majority of the people watching the playoffs are just now seeing him for the first time then they probably think he’s like a Kyle Kuzma or something   So of course he gonna get trashed because now people are like “I finally see this guy and I’m not impressed”. They have the right to not be impressed but I don’t think he should get as trashed as Twitter is gonna do to him
"I’m starting to believe you don’t understand the basics of building a team. Vet minimums can pull extremely valuable players like Marc gasol, Kyle korver (too old now), Austin rivers, nerlens Noel.  You use these contracts to round out your team and complete the 8-12 spots in a rotation - not to sign a superstar. The warriors already have their starters in Steph, Klay, dray, wiseman, and Wiggins.   Look up hubris my guy"
"I'd look for other fringe all-star candidates that are on max contracts. Then see if any make sense for both teams.  So Tobias Harris, Kyle Lowry (sign &amp; trade), Westbrook, Wiggins, Conley, Hayward, Kemba, Siakem, Murray, Draymond, Ingram etc.  Not all those guys would make sense but that would be the kind of guy I'd be targeting if I was the GM."
"I think it's a combination of things. While some can be attributed to the oddities of this past season, some will need to be addressed by the league in the form of either shorter seasons, more rest days, or something else.  Short off-season: Pretty self-explanatory. Both Finals teams were gassed by the regular season start and most teams that had deep runs last season had major injuries to key players.  COVID-19: Long stretches where players couldn't play (or participate in team practices) because of protocol meant that they came back relatively rusty and had to get up to speed again. Not an issue if you're a deep bench guy, but definitely a load management issue if you normally play heavy minutes. If a player was positive for COVID, that likely has lasting consequences too (e.g. Tatum saying he was winded for a while after returning).  Pushing athletic extremes: Every year, the league sees an arms race as everyone (except Kyle Anderson) tries to jump as high as possible, be as quick as possible, break ankles, and more to compete with the best. Also, pace increasing means guys have to score and defend on more possessions, they have to get out in transition more on both sides, and more. Additionally, increased team play and off-ball movement means guys are just moving a lot more than before, when teams just chucked it into their big man and watched them go to work. Sacrifices have to be made for a beautiful game.  Physicality: Making it harder to play physical defense means that defenders have to be even quicker and more precise in their movements, leading to more wear and tear on joints. I put this separately from pushing athletic extremes because this is something that can be officiated."
"&gt; Holmes is not a defensive guy lol  At least he can grab a rebound once in a while. The defensive possession doesn't end until your team gets the ball back, so rebounding is an important part of team defense. And Porzingis had a worse Reb% in the 1st round than Kyle Kuzma. He gave up multiple offensive rebounds to smaller Clippers who had no business getting em."
"That sounds right, but I don’t think it’ll kick in until next year.   That’s why I don’t think the Porzingis contract hurts them much. Next year Luka’s extension will kick in and Hardaway Jr will have a pay raise as well, which means that this season is the only one where the Mav’s will have cap space, regardless of what they do with Porzingis.   Unfortunately for them, there aren’t really any max worthy guys available this season, so dropping Porzingis’s contract just to clear space  this season doesn’t really make sense either. Maybe a guy like Kyle Lowry or DeRozen would make sense?? But they can sign one of those guys *and* keep Porzingis."
"It’s not sexy, but as a Mavs fan I wanted a guy like Kyle Anderson as part of the core around Luka."
"i hate marvin bagley so much, i don’t know the guy so i don’t hate him as a person but essentially he’s got the attitude of a star with the game of less healthy kyle kuzma. his family is a discount ball family and he hasn’t progressed at all since being drafted. it hurts me even more knowing that one of our front office guys said we would have taken bagley at #1"
"I like how you just ignored SHAQ like I didn't bring him up lmao.  Lebron has played with multiple legit career 40% shooters from 3 every year like Kyle Korver on that 2018 squad but somehow those 3-pt snipers always shot like shit when they play with Lebron. Why is that? Maybe it's the Lebron system that they were playing in? For a guy who has the reputation of making the guys around him better, Lebron's teammates sure always underperform when they play with him don't they?  Speaking of 10+ points, Jae Crowder has looked like an above average role player on every team he's played on except the Cavs. Same with Danny Green with the Lakers, he's has been great on the spurs, raptors, and sixers this year but everyone could've sworn he was the worst player in the league last year.  IT was garbage on the defensive end, but could've at least averaged 10 ppg. You're acting like he didn't average 30 the year before. I'm also just listing you players on the Cavs squad that could've given Lebron 10 points on the Cavs squad."

This guy talking about Steph like he’s Kyle Lowry or something lmao.
Holy shit... Kyle korver?? The guy who made a career out of it and is 40 years old now??? You arent helping your case lol this is an absurd argument
"I mean you'd need another guy outside of KLow to  up too. Kyle just gives the Lakers a puncher's chance, but doesn't make them favourites."
"Lakers need to be looking at trades for Kyle Kuzma, ThT is alright but I see him capping out at a 15ppg-18ppg kind of guy"
The lakers could really use a guy like Kyle Lowry rn.  Too bad they chose talen Horton hears a who instead.
"Yeah, it still helps. It’s the difference between being able to make a full bid for Kawhi Leonard while retaining Robinson and Nunn too, and having to trade everyone except Bam and Jimmy to have the space to sign Kawhi.  It’s the difference between having the cap space to sign Kyle Lowry and another guy (Oladipo, Ibaka, Markannen) and only being able to sign just Lowry.  Bam not having the patience to wait made it much harder for the Heat to improve their roster this summer."
I think he was referring to Kyle Guy
If we can avoid trading OG and get Beal then I’d say maybe do it. Bring Kyle back and make a run for the next 3-4 years. I’m extremely biased and emotionally attached so I’d hate to see OG go even for a guy like Beal.
"Certainly seems like a guy playing his best ball from age 22-25 requires explanation but look at some [nba aging curves](https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+aging+curve&amp;rlz=1C1ZCEB_enUS844US844&amp;oq=nba+aging+curve&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59.3425j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) and mourn your fleeting youth.  The most common peak is about 25-26 years old, so for every Kyle Lowry or Steve Nash who peak after 30 there's gotta be at least a couple Blake Griffins and Ben Gordon's who peak sooner."
"He looks like he could use a Tony Parker or Kyle Lowry to be that guy next to him, oh wait."
"He was somewhat passive in his 2 years at UVA, and tended to defer to Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy (granted, both were future draft picks as well).   You could see the potential oozing from Dre, but the consistency on offense wasn't there. But when he was on, you knew he was gonna be great"
"&gt;Hypothetically, if a guy shot 50% from 3 on 10PA for 2 years and then went back to mediocrity shooting below 40. where would you rate him?  Depends on his mid-range and free throw efficiency. Wouldn't discount the possibility that I'd consider him the GOAT.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Set it at 5 3PA at 45% and see who shows up. Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick and Joe Harris. No Steph  Uh, no. Steph shows up with his '16 season. '12 season is close too.     &gt;So tell me, are Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick and Joe Harris better than Steph.  Your stat is wrong though.     &gt;Or are you sure Dame is the 2nd best shooter of all time  Mentioned by many people commenting on this post but it was never implied by me. I said he has a better case for 2nd best shooter in the league."
"The team is shooting like 30% from the field and a large portion of that is LeBron's fault. You don't expect Kyle fucking Kuzma to make a bucket, you expect the guy who wants a claim to the GOAT argument."
"I guess if you say ""probably"". It's all opinion based, and I would disagree on a lot of those. Kyrie has never shown he can lead a team or be ""the guy"" on a team. But I know you said Raptors last because you want me to contest with Kyle Lowry lol, which I would take 100 times out of 100 over Kyrie (obviously biased)"
30 mpg for Kyle would be way too much. You remember how the guy from clockstoppers aged really fast because he stayed in slowed down time too long?
"Why does Kyle Anderson, the slowest guy on the court, not simply...  I don't know how to finish that reference. How does he keep getting steals."
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"Thanks, Idk why this guy is being a dick. It was pretty clear from my original comment that I didn’t know who Chris Kyle was."
"Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks are both right up there when it comes to ""how the hell are this guy so good"""
"Norm worked pretty good with Kyle and FVV. But, those guy are fucking dogs. They play like they are 5 inches taller."
"Its sometimes disheartening though, if you talk to a casual fan of basketball not from Milwuakee, New Orleans, or maybe Philadelphia about Jrue Holiday youre more likely to get a ""who?"" Response than anything. I wouldnt be surprised if Kyle Kuzma had more name recognition, which is sad, bc a calender year ago he was a net negative player. Jrue's not the flashiest guy but has a really smart, physical game. Hope the Nets series can really make ppl aware of him if he can pull a Dort on Harden while hitting some clutch baskets."
Kyle kuzma has disappointed on so many shots. But i gotta give it to the guy he’s been crashing the boards and making good passes so credit where it’s due.
Replace Kyle Kuzma with some homeless guy outside Staples
That’s interesting you mention playmaking because 2 years ago when people were comparing Kawhi to all time great wings like Wade and Kobe people brought up that he was a step below those guys as a play maker/Facilitator. Kyle Lowry took care of that.  Kawhi was perfect for that team because they just needed a guy who can get buckets.
"Nothing makes mine better. Set it at 10 3PA and 40% and tell me who even shows up. It's Steph thrice and Dame once. Set it at 5 3PA at 45% and see who shows up. Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick and Joe Harris. No Steph. So tell me, are Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick and Joe Harris better than Steph. Or are you sure Dame is the 2nd best shooter of all time? You 2 criteria have no overlap, so we can't make meaningful observations from them. Lowering it to 5 3PA at 40 gives us all the guys and then you can draw conclusions from that. Also, why are we doing individual seasons and not career. Discard everyone's worst 2 or 3 years if you want but do career. Hypothetically, if a guy shot 50% from 3 on 10PA for 2 years and then went back to mediocrity shooting below 40. where would you rate him?"
But how could u generalize an entire fanbase over one guy. Your franbase had hundreds of people harass someone and their family for having a bad game. And the worse part is you guys have done it multiple times. You guys even set up a petition for kyle Kuzma to not get an nba ring that over 18k people signed. One guy being a pos isn’t a representation of an entire fanbase but thousands of pieces of Shits is a pretty bad look
What about the delusional guy?   He’s not basura like me and you still jumped in to defend the honor of Kyle Korver.
"Just looking at your stats. You know why Klay is the 2nd best shooter of all time? He shot above 40% from 3 at high volume for 4 consecutive seasons. Ray Allen did it twice 4 seasons apart. Kyle Korver did it twice then dropped off. Dame did it once. Duncan Robinson did it once and then dropped off. The only reason Klay didn't do it the last 2 years is because he didn't play. Comeback when someone can do it consistently for as many years. That is all the argument you need. Actually, scratch that. Klay has shot above 40 from 3 every single season he has played. You are probably the same kinda guy that was running Dame&gt;Steph last year when steph wasn't even playing."
That’s why you need a guy like Kyle Lowry next to him.
"i think kyle anderson’s value is higher than a lot think and will grow even more after another good season. he’s had a breakout year where his scoring has become good enough and he’s just become a super valuable versatile contributor on both ends. defensively he’s lowkey elite where his monster wingspan allows him to be adept in the passing lanes and in transition, and he just has really good lateral quickness and anticipation one on one. he can just perfectly slot into pretty much any team and give them a boost on both ends as a complement to anyone’s game.   i don’t know what the market will look like and i don’t know what teams have cap space but i could see him getting thrown 20+ a year by a good-level team who wants that perfect glue guy to take another step to being a complete team. that may be the grizzlies. i don’t know how they feel about jjj and vice versa but jjj has crazy potential i can’t see them trading him. i don’t see them paying jv."
He was for a large portion of the season. Kyle is the leader but he was the #1 guy.
"jrue is the ultimate x-factor guy, similar to kyle lowry but less controversial pre-chip."
"He's totally slow.  A lot of guys on the fast break win with speed, they don't know what the defense is doing behind them so they go faster to make it irrelevant.  Watch a Kyle fastbreak, he doesn't go as slow as possible or anything, he goes just slow enough to figure out what they guy behind him is doing. He makes that read and then finishes with confidence the other way.  Most guys his size can't do this because they'd just get their pocket picked, and this happens to Kyle sometimes.  However, his handle is tight enough so that more often than not, it's a winning play."
"Kyle Anderson is exactly the kind of guy every team needs in these situations, really under appreciated player."
Kyle Anderson the only black guy with deceptive speed.
"For a guy that slow, Kyle has some quick hands"
Kawhi needed a Pointguard more then anything as a number 2 if he’s to make it work. Idk who’s available but when you have a guy like Kyle Lowry and Tony Parker/Ginobli(even tho they were old af) who can play make and run the offense at a high level it makes his job easier to where all he has to do is get buckets and defend. This Clips team is built terribly
"Kyle Korver? The guy who made a career on shooting and is known as a great 3 point shooter? ""Of course he bricked"" lol what"
"I'm sure he is a high IQ guy, but not in the realm of gamesmanship of Rondo or CP3, or the ability to direct defensice adjustments like Draymond Green. Like most things, there are levels to this. Those guys plus LeBron and Kyle Lowry imo are just above the rest."
"Not very related, but did Kyle Guy do anything this season? I remember him kicking ass in NCAA and then I checked his stats and he just has nothing lol. I thought he was gonna do really well but seems they didn't play him much if at all"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
Kyle Anderson is the same type of guy
"Yeah I definitely agree. I also think there’s a lot of guys who are so good at their role that I value them more than a lower impact young guy putting up good numbers on a bad team.   I think having guys like Kyle Anderson, Jarrett Allen, Joe Ingles, Robert Covington helps teams win more than Garland. Ingles is a pretty egregious omission from this list imo."
"Their stats are pretty close, Kuz just has more ppg and way more rpg. Also has more mpg though.   That being said… you’re only validating my point by comparing one of the warriors most important players to Kyle Kuzma lol Kuz is like our 6th or 7th most important guy"
You can tell who watches Kings games (lol) and who doesn't. People think Buddy is this awesome athletic 3 and D guy who can create off the dribble... in reality he's basically Atlanta Hawks Kyle Korver with more usage
"Right? It boggles my mind that people always fall for these obvious PR statements.   Like the Lakers would come out and say   ""yeah unfortunately we couldn't get rid of that Kuzma guy lmao""   When they could say   ""We would never trade our star child Kyle, he is an important part of our future""  And then there will be an expectation for Kyle Kuzma to repay the Lakers for the loyalty they actually never even had for him. And the fans eat it up hahaha"
The world was not ready for a Kyle Guy  windmill
"He’s been their rock this year with Harden, KD and Kyrie all missed time.. Joe Harris is the main constant..  I love that his game evolves more than just a catch and shoot guy. He’s a better defender than the likes of JJ Redick, Kyle Korver and Duncan Robinson  He can put the ball on the floor and dribble into a mid range shot or drive, can play make a little bit of catch and shoot scenario"
who the fuck is that Kyle guy
Kyle “Just A” Guy
"He’s an NBA end-of-bencher, but Kyle Guy is an NCAA legend. Legitimately probably a top five player in UVA history, could be a jersey honor/retirement candidate (I’m unsure how UVA does that.) He and his shooting are a huge part of their recent title, ACC success, and overall best era in program history. Came up clutch against Texas Tech and Purdue in their title run too.  As another comment said, yes, Kyle Guy was on the team that lost to UMBC, but he put in a good performance and looked like the only UVA player who wanted to win/took UMBC seriously."
Auburn sends their regards. Fuck you Kyle Guy!
Yeah but people don't associate that loss with Kyle Guy. Anyone who is a CBB fan associates Kyle Guy with three clutch free throws and a bunch of clutch 3s in the least three rounds of UVa's championship run.
"maybe for uva, but not for kyle guy the player. that three vs auburn and the subsequent free throws are more noteworthy for him"
"ncaa champion, kyle guy."
Yeah but this is Kyle Guy
Kyle Guy remembers when the rims were lower precovid restrictions.
Some Kyle guy
1. Mo Bamba 2. Hasheem Thabeet 3. Bol Bol 4. Kyle Guy 5. Sean May 6. Rashard Lewis 7. Cody Martin 8. Steve Vasturia 9. Jamal Magloire 10. Jamal Mashburn
"And that's coming from a guy who would take Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson or John wall over Kyle Lowry. Absolutely garbage take. Basketball is more than regular season offence. What other PG in the last 50 years can be switched onto an all star 7 foot centre and make them pass the ball out instead of posting up? What other PG of this generation can take a charge, get a steal, hit a long range pull up 3, and run a pick and roll alley oop to perfection all in a 3 min span - and that's a normal night for him? Have you ever actually watched an NBA game before? My god."
"Becoming Draymond is basically impossible, but Barnes is one of the only guys that the comp actually makes sense as in the super optimistic ""this is what this guy looks like if he hits his best outcome"" kinda way.  Cause Barnes genuinely seems like a really strong defender and passer and good handler for guy his size.  But might be more reasonable to say Kyle Anderson or someone like that, who is more on par with the sort of player Barnes can reasonably expect to become."
"Idk, not many people know much about about Kyle Guy."
"I mean Stephs off ball gravity *is* unlike any other player in the league, but just because the first part is true, does that mean the second part is? KD was a great player before and after the Warriors so why would you allow people to mix up 2 separate narratives so that you can shit on both narratives yourself? People's arguments can be half right, going in at both narratives to prove a point is just as ridiculous as one person saying both are right or both are wrong.  First part isn't really debatable. You have never seen running screener 3 point shooters like Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, JJ Reddick or Kyle Korver getting doubled or tripled 5-10 feet behind the 3 point line without the ball like Steph. Maybe down the stretch to get a trap sure, but not in the middle of the first half/3rd quarter nor on a fast break.   Second part I can see the debate, which can go either way because Steph had one bad game in the finals where Stephs gravity was most apparent. Like how often do you see multiple people on a fast break cover the guy without the ball first? Never. Absolutely never. But, it did happen multiple times in one game in the finals where a dude who won FMVP had a free running lane to the basket when multiple defenders could have stood in his way to take a charge or attempt to contest. I mean there's a debate there, which could go either way because KD was actually that good with or without Stephs gravity. As long as the debate is about how Steph couldn't get going a few times because of the defense on him and not about how KD only looks good because Steph's gravity. The second part of that statement is absolutely false cause KD is good with or without Stephs gravity."
"This is an interesting take. I like it. I also see you’re a Raptors fan. Kyle Lowry was all about DeMar DeRozan for years and years. They had a famously good rapport. But you see where I’m going with this. Now maybe Masai Ujiri was able to make that particular trade work with SAS, and nothing of the sort has presented itself to the Blazers since Aldridge left.  Maybe.  But I could imagine Dame getting frustrated with the FO not at least building assets for trade even if nothing happened. It’s cliche because every team did, but we know they passed on Jokić in the draft because he was 2nd round. I bet Dame has looked at a lot of closer examples of a better player at the same or similar position falling in a draft for a guy who didn’t even play year four in Portland.  I also don’t think guys like Lillard are in the self-reflection business. I think you’ve got a good point, that if he’s blocking a trade for CJ they could only really trade or add starting front court players to affect real change. But that sounds like something Dame will reflect on later in life.  Right now, the team isn’t one move away, and even if they took those moves it would hobble the team’s future to take a chance at Win Now with maybe one new star and most of the pieces already around him. Meanwhile he could go to Philly, Milwaukee, maybe Toronto, or a half dozen teams in the west, and at least be better positioned immediately."
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe? Different era.  &gt; Joe Johnson  [One of the first high profile cases on small market teams having to pay non-deserving max contracts to land meh talent](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/414272-atlanta-hawks-ink-joe-johnson-to-119-million-over-six-year-deal)  Literally goes against the argument you are trying to make.  &gt; Steve Nash (prime)  Sure fine  &gt; Tim Duncan  Drafted on a team and won a ring in his second season.  The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.  Next.  &gt; Yao Ming  lol he agreed to a 4 year max after not playing for a year with foot surgery.  Chinese national I don't think playing for NY is exactly a priority anyways  &gt; Dwight Howard  I mean.. i guess  &gt; Kevin Garnett  I mean he left Minnesota (small market) team for Boston (big market) team so idk..  &gt; Kevin Durant 1.0 free agency (picked Dubs over NYC/LA, who had space and wanted him)  This is the absolute dumbest thing I have ever read.  The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
"Only thing I care about right now is what happens with Kyle, if Masai is re-signing or not, and who the 4th pick will be. Other than that, from a now casual perspective I'd like Giannis to win his first chip. Seems like a nice guy, so does Jrue and Khris. CP3 is a bit of a dick, and Booker looks like Donnie Whalberg with a Beauty filter."
"But you’re willing to hold mid-late first round picks against a guy? If you get a good player there, maybe you scouted well, but you’re also just lucky. If you thought the picks they made were absolutely dumb at the time, fine. But if it’s a hindsight, I think that’s a pretty soft criticism. Besides, the Kyle Kuzmas and Jarrett Allens of the world aren’t changing their fortune. If anything, the criticism here is not turning those assets into something bigger than a mid round first picks.   This team needs a better star. They might even need a star better than Dame. Most championship teams feature a star better than him. The Suns would be an exception to that, but look at who has dominated the title picture. Lebron has been somewhere near the best player in the league. Curry was an MVP the year the Warriors went and was maybe the best player in the league over the Warriors title run. Kawhi was a top 6 or so player over the past few years. That’s the usual level at which you win titles. Kuzma or your good role player drafted at 27 doesn’t get you there. You need to hit big.   Obviously you don’t give him credit if he’s missing on these draft picks, but this is idea that it wouldn’t be an issue if they drafted better is pretty bogus to me."
"My guy, we both know the Blazers really want Kyle Kuzma and a 20208 2nd   No typo"
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
"brook helps rim protection but is not an enormous upgrade over bam at that and is worse than bam/draymond at post defense and switching.  unfortunately he may have the worst height-to-rebounding-skill ratio in the league, the guy has averaged *five* a game over the past five years, which is literally the same as 6'0 kyle lowry and chris paul have. Myles Turner is slightly better on the glass but is the same archetype, stretch rim protecting big, below aberage on the glass. If they need pure rebounds they need Allen.  Funnily enough, Russell Westbrook averages more offensive rebounds per game than both Lopez and Turner, which is insane. He averages more boards overall than anyone on team USA including Bam and is the nba assists leader, he might literally be able to play point center for this team lmao"
"idk it's pretty common for players to develop later. he's the current exception but there's one on every team. Pat Bev, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton, Marcus was considered worse than Markieff for a good while, Seth Curry, Spencer Dinwiddie, most teams have a guy who developed late and became a productive member of a playoff team. There's lots of routes in the nba and late bloomers for sure exist."
Throw in Kyle guy and I think you’ve got a deal.
"Simmons is also not really the right personality for Philly. He is kind of passive and more of a shoulder shrug type guy that just is gonna keep pissing off the Philly fans. The trade is strange because Simmons is losing trade value for Philly because there is no way to convince the fans that just running it back is gonna be a good idea after the way they went out in the playoffs, but at the same time Simmons received an MVP vote last year so you can't just let him go just to shake it up. Simmons probably NEEDS to leave but the Sixers probably aren't getting equal value back unless it is multiple trades.   Here is the trade idea I have seen kicked around the Wolves sub.   Raptors-Wolves-Sixers.  Raptors get Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio  Wolves get Simmons and Baynes.   Sixers get Malik Beasley, Kyle Lowry and 2 Wolves 1sts.   Raptors do it to get the veteran leader in Rubio to come in and hopefully mentor Suggs (Mitchell and Edwards have both raved about how good Rubio is at helping them get up to NBA speed), also as an expiring they can restock next year they can possibly flip him. They get a super team friendly contract in Naz who has shown flashes and they get to not play Baynes anymore. Giving up Lowry is just a S+T so the cost to them is minimal to be part of the trade.   Wolves get their guy in Simmons, take on the Baynes contract and maybe he can show better here than he did in his disaster season in Tampa.   Sixers get a real PG that they can trust to take big shots and they get a knockdown shooter to help create space for Embiid. Curry doesn't need to be the only threat beyond the arc if they add Beasley. The 2 1st can be packaged together with some of the Sixers other assets or picks if they decide they need to make another run at a star like Beal."
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
"Lol ok, he *can* sign the MLE, but he *won’t*, and for that reason it’s completely out of the question and impossible.   Kyle Lowry is not that kind of guy, he’s said what he expects to make.  He’s said he wants to be valued, straight up."
When two good players are put together one is almost always going to outshine the other. If Tatum is on the Suns probably only one of develops into the player they are now. The situation you are in drastically changes how you grow.   Kyle Kuzma was looking like a perennial allstar before LeBron joined the Lakers and when AD got there and Kuzma became the 3rd option his development got even worse. It’s safe to say if he was on a team where he was the main guy he would have developed into an allstar but that’s not the hand he was dealt.
Kyle Anderson easily. Still a guy anyone would want on their team tho
"I'll give you Kyle Lowry then.  An 18pt/7ast, 42FG% guy who had a teammate for better HoF eilgibility is no superstar, though."
Ya last olympics(?) Kyle Lowry was looking like the best part of that team even though he’s on the floor with top 50 all-timers cause he was the only guy not looking for a shot so a lot of the offence was flowing through him.
"We don't have an elite playmaker on this team. Bunch of guys who are iso players. We need a Steph, Lebron, CP3, Harden, or even a guy like Kyle Lowry who can set up guys to take shots."
"Seconded, J. Kyle. I’ll add Jonathan Tjarks as a great analytical, non-hot take guy, &amp; dig-able dude as well."
"Lol how did you interpret that as me treating Pau like Ariza? My point is players, regardless of how good they, are still dependent on the players around them. If Pau stayed in Memphis he would have never won a ring. You don’t have to be a HOFer to be the number 2 on a champion team (Kyle Lowry) so saying a guy is a HOFer just because he won a championship is stupid. Not to mention it implies that guys who have never won like Barkley, Stockton, and Malone, weren’t good enough to win.   We should assess players on their production and how great they were at their peak. Not give them credit for team awards. Pau is a 6x all star and 2x all NBA player. He’s borderline"
Lol the support for Kyle is asinine. The guy sucks and now he’s crying wolf. His role is simply to get buckets off the bench and he instead is a turnover machine with an incredibly low efficient shooting capabilities.
"&gt; It’s not brutal when comparing it to league average. Isn’t Kyle Lowry the best rap of all time, multi time all star, leader? What’s he doing just below league average?  He had a drop off from his regular season. Like I said before and agreed with. Which I didn't deny. I am saying it is wrong to call it brutal. Drop offs from the regular season to playoffs aren't something that only happen to Lowry, and they are more common for small guards. Are all Pacers fan this delusional or something? Or are yall just dumb.  &gt; Lol these guys will say anything to defend A rap.  If saying 0.6% below league average true shooting isn't brutal and that Lowry does have drop offs from his regular season into the playoffs is defending a Raptor, then whatever. But it ain't. I literally agreed with you about his drop off.  &gt; Just today you had OG as the second coming of Kawhi. Lmao L that  What's funny is, we didn't call OG the next Kawhi one of his player comparisons going into the draft was actually Kawhi Leonard. You know, before he ever was drafted by the Raptors. You know, by American draft scouts like Draft Express and American media like ESPN. So hold another L my guy."
"I don’t know man. The raw numbers drop off, shooting percentages drop off. They are not good. Didn’t go he scoreless even just last year against the magic one game?  Before Kawhi, Kyle was by in large known as a playoff underachiever.  Just google Kyle Lowry playoff struggles and dozens of articles from different years laying out all his stats pop up.  .6 below league average? Sure but isn’t Kyle supposed to be the all star, leader and the guy? Why are you comparing him to league average?"
This guy is becoming the next Kyle Kuzma except he is making a max contract.  Philly better get rid of him quick before he goes full Kuzma mode and starts dying his hair different colors every week.  It's in your hands Morey!🙏
"That article kind of says the opposite. It talks about how role players would generally jump at the chance to play with Lebron because they are used to being role players with limited offensive involvement, but All Stars/All-NBA guys wouldn’t because they don’t want to be marginalized.   Sorry for the length, but I pulled a few quotes from the article.   Tyson Chandler: *”If you’ve got LeBron, you’ve got to make it all about LeBron. You’ve got to be able to [coexist] with that and fit with that.”*  Kevin Durant: *”It depends on what kind of player you are. If you’re Kyle Korver, then it makes sense. Because Kyle Korver in Atlanta was the bulk of the offense, and he’s not a No. 1 option at all, not even close. So his talents benefit more from a guy who can pass and penetrate and get him open.”*  Trevor Ariza: *“Guys similar to [LeBron], why would they want to play with somebody who does all the same things? I can see why they would want to play elsewhere.”*  Rudy Gay: *“A lot of people are going back to thinking, ‘I can possibly be as good as him,’ and sometimes when people think of playing with someone like that, they feel it hinders them, maybe, from getting to that point because he takes up so much of [the] opportunities.”*  Durant again:*“LeBron is a player that needs to play with guys that already know how they play the game—and shooters. Like, young players that are still developing, it’s always going to be hard because he demands the ball so much, he demands control of the offense and he creates for everybody.”*  *“None of the players approached for this story, both stars and supporting cast types, resented that James’ stardom “sucks up all the oxygen in the room,” as one Eastern Conference vice president put it. But there is little doubt they would have to transform themselves and accept lesser roles than they enjoy now if they joined the Lakers.”*  *“What comes with that is the knowledge that if the team wins, it will be credited mostly to James; and if the team loses, it will be blamed on everyone around him.”*  *“Bosh and Love were established All-Stars before they hooked up with LeBron, but the perception of them shifted from franchise cornerstones to, at times, weak links in James’ quests for another ring…It earned them championships, but the perception remains they were the beneficiaries of being James’ teammates.”*"
Suggs cause he’s next up  They should hope Mobley falls to them but Suggs would be a good replacement to Kyle Lowry or a nice guy to build around if they want to blow it up
"- traded for Allen with a late Bucks 2022 first, that we got from trading George Hill   - traded future 2nds to reach into the first round and get KPJ (it's unfortunate what happened after but the pick itself was immensely quality value)   - in addition to the first-round picks I talked about, signing potential rotation players like Dean Wade and Dylan Windler who can space the floor and defend multiple positions   - making the most out of our ""assets"" (like a 36 year old Kyle Korver, George Hill, Javale McGee) and either creating future draft capital in the form of firsts or seconds   - so yeah, when a guy as good as lebron leaves, you're not gonna be good. instead of being salty at an organization you have paid no attention to, be grateful that your team jumped up in the lotto. Enjoy Suggs"
"It's not a dirty list, its a list of players that other fanbases hate for their antics. I'd put Kyle Lowry on here too and he's not dirty.  Now, Dragic. Fuck that guy."
"Siakam has proven that he is able to the second or third guy on a championship level team. For the next couple of years, the Raptors won't be trading him for anything less than someone who could be the best player on a championship team. Maybe in the last year of his contract they might flip him for very speculative assets, but not anytime soon.  The Raptors don't make deals for the sake of making deals. Masai Ujiri turned down a bunch of offers he considered to be too low for Kyle Lowry this year, even though he might walk for nothing this summer.  Wiseman was disappointing this season, and didn't stay healthy. He might someday turn into a player you would build a championship team around, but that's looking less likely than him being a pretty good role player.  Even if the Raptors do want to eventually move on from Siakam, it makes more sense to hold on to him and wait for when some superstar level player gets disgruntled, and trade Siakam along with some first rounders for the Superstar. Dame, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum - all of them seem to be in super frustrating situations and may want to leave in a couple years."
"Fwiw that team was on pace to win 58-60 games before the rondo trade, then they trade role players and filler for an all star still in his prime in Rondo??   Replace Rondo with Kyle Lowry and that team is incredible. They had 3 guys who could go off for 30 points any given night and all three could create their own offense, Parsons and Ellis were both great secondary ball handlers and Tyson was an elite defender still and great roll guy.   With Rondo they were like a 45 win team, but before the trade they had an all time great offense with lots of weapons and chemistry. Not title favorites by any means but if Dallas somehow was able to get Conley or Lowry instead of Rondo I think they could’ve been a fringe title contender that year. Warriors were still young, as were the Rockets, Thunder were injured and Spurs were showing age. West was pretty wide open that year."
"No, I know, never meant to say Lillard mails it in, just that Pop (and this is pushing that same style to Hammond) doesnt like mistakes on defense and Lillard (and for that matter McCollum) have never been considered stalwarts in that department.   Tony Parker was yelled quite a few times for this and for other mistakes on the court, even when he was the main guy. Same with TD and Manu at their peaks. Kawhi got some earlashings as well, and Danny Green, Kyle Anderson, George Hill, and many more have been victimized by Pop.   This is assuming Hammond would follow a similar style, which may very well be not the case."
"You know, I've always been into the idea of trading Fred, but a guy I know (who actually writes for a Raptors publication) pointed out that Fred is going to be the team leader going forward, which is a good point. With Powell gone we're going to need Kyle or Fred to be the team vet, or we'll be a rudderless team like the Wolves or the Kings.  You could already see Kyle allowing Fred to become the team leader this season. It was especially funny when Fred somehow got his hands on the coaching staff's polos and became Coach Fred on the sidelines."
Agree on every point I’m a huge Kyle Lowry guy. Trey Murphy seems like a good fit for us in that mid first round range (he can shoot and defend and is pretty athletic) though I admit I haven’t done much scouting if any this year.
"It was a pretty weird year for the commentators, too, going from sitting court side to watching the tv feed during the bubble, and then eventually returning into the arena but from afar.   I don’t think Gorman fared all that well with the changes, maybe Scal went a little haywire and Gorman didn’t manage to rein him back in since it was all so different than any of the nearly four decades of commentating Gorman has already done.  He’ll retire soon, which is a damn shame because I think Mike Gorman’s a world class play by play guy and we’ve been lucky to have him for all this time.  Next I’m hoping they’ll pull Sean Grande off the radio and into the booth, glad that Kyle Draper guy found a job elsewhere already."
He will end up like Kyle Guy
"Since 1980  16/41 are guys in their 30s   And a lot of the guys referenced had major help from guys in their 30s  Tiny Archibald, Kyle Lowry, KAJ, Shaq w/ wade, Curry was 30 In 2018 when they won. KD was 30 when his Achilles snapped and curry was 31 and would’ve won. KD wins this year if kyrie Aged 29 doesn’t go down.  I mean 2015 finals Lebron aged 30 was the best player in the world and was fmvp if they didn’t give it to the other 30+ guy Iggy. 2011 bron you could argue wasn’t even in his prime because he hadn’t shown he could win and clutch it. So 2 years in his 20s vs like 4-5 seasons since In his 30s of prime years.   I’m also saying there’s more guys in 30+ in their prime than guys early in their 20s. The prime sweet spot may be 26-29 and for the average player fine. But for a star it gets extended. It just does.  I mean does magic drop off at 30 Or does he just get HIV? And his team retires or gets really old leading to MJ   Pierce Garnett, Allen, all in their 30s contending.   Don’t get me started on John Stockton who’s majority of all star appearances and all nba 1st and 2nd teams came aged 30+  Or how Karl Malone was the same and won his mvps at 34 and 36   Wilt was 30 and 35 as nba champion, his only fmvp at 35 too, he also won 2/4 his mvps at aged 30 and 31. The other being 23 and 29.   Idc about weighted age, I care about calling superstars past their prime at 30. The ancillary bench guys idc. This is about whether superstars still carry in their 30s or they cooked at 29"
"It's crazy how for 8 years every smart basketball person has said ""Kyle Lowry is a top 20 or better player in the league and is underrated"" and people on comment threads are still somehow knocking the guy. After everything he's done! After his massive playoffs streak, dragging every conceivable lineup of misfits along with him to the best damn net ratings in the league.  Put some damn respect on his name. Kyle Lowry ain't no"
"&gt;  Prime Kyle Korver wide open from 3 is one of the highest expected points per possession plays you can imagine.  This sentence alone shows why analytics sometimes are the worst and why you didn't understand a single sentence of what i said.  &gt; No one wants him shooting wide open, and the defense would never intentionally leave him wide open. This is a guy who has shot &gt;50% on wide open threes for periods of his career. He doesn't all the sudden become a 12% shooter just because the shot clock gets turned off in the 4th.  The Warriors clearly wanted to do so in that case, in fact they were about to do that in that Game 3, but LeBron saw it, Steph read the play and contested the shot.  The Miami Heat literally did the same thing with Danny Green, a 40% career 3-PT shooter, they INTENTIONALLY leave him wide open because they would rather have two players guarding LeBron and Green open than letting LeBron get a 1-on-1.  &gt; He doesn't all the sudden become a 12% shooter just because the shot clock gets turned off in the 4th.  Oof. Unfortunately for you, he quite literally does become that. In the 2016 playoffs (a year before joining LeBron) Korver shot an astounding 0% from 3-PT range in clutch moments (as defined by the NBA), that was a little worse than his performance the year before, where he shot 8.3% , but it's fine though, he also shot 0% from 3 in clutch moments in 2005, 2008 and 2012 in the postseason."
"Please delete this. Prime Kyle Korver wide open from 3 is one of the highest expected points per possession plays you can imagine.

He doesn't all the sudden become a 12% shooter just because the shot clock gets turned off in the 4th.  And you don't even seem to know why one player is maxed and another isn't. Korver made what he did because he basically had one single elite skill that was second to no one, but didn't bring enough value otherwise. Players aren't maxed because of some stupid intangible idea that they ""step up, bro!"" in ""big moments."" Otherwise, why wasn't Rudy Gay first team all NBA?"
"Except he didn't do nothing, he walked across the court and got right in Boogies face and then did the ""hold me back"" after boogie had walked away and the refs didn't do anything, as detailed above. I still don't understand how boogie is soft for pushing a guy who got in his face after a loss to try and... draw a technical foul? With 0.1 on the clock?  Yeah that makes sense.  Remember when Gobert got ejected and then got in the face of Kyle Anderson?  kyle pushed him, Rudy flopped like a fish, and everyone deservedly made fun of him. How is this not the same thing and why is it badass when booker does it, that's the part I don't get."
"yet the raptors manage to make it to a conference finals with demar derozan and kyle lowry at times playing like shit before they got bounced by lebron with dwane casey of all people!  Demar Derozan scored in the single digits 3 times in that playoff run, he was in the teens multple of times, He was the best raptor on that team, he didn't play like it but they still were able to beat indy, beat milwaukee, and make it to a conference final.   Why can't doc even do that? If ben sucks in the next round, okay, I can see that. Milwaukee is a good team in the east, ben should be that player that delivers, but doc can't beat the atlanta hawks and make it to the conference final? Really? the atlanta hawks? Dwane Casey can coach with his star playing being inconsistent, but doc with his second star player that's not known as a scorer can't?   We're not asking Doc to pull off an upset, here. We're asking doc to beat the atlanta hawks. the atlanta hawks. undermanned atlanta hawks where hunter went out and bogie was not himself for 2 straight games.   I'm telling you man, we really have to look at doc as the issue. Seriously lol. The guy is a joke."
"Can Kyle Anderson finally shoot? I remember being obsessed with him in his UCLA days, telling everyone I could that this guy is an all star the moment he develops a reliable jumper. LOL. Not my best take."
Yup gotta be Kyle Williams. Dumb shit wine n cheese 9er fans destroyed that guy
That Kyle Lowry guy is ok at the pick and roll
"Kyle Lowry is the guy they need. A tough defender who can shoot, playmake and has experience to provide leadership."
"Yeah Kyle Lowry the guy with no finals appearances until kawhi was the key to saving the sixers, lakers and heat. Y’all keep bringing up all these scenarios cause you won’t get shit when he walks. If you don’t think green Maxey and Thybulle AND A FRP isn’t an over pay, that’s delusional for an expiring 35 year old"
"Who was the Kyle Kuzma of the 90s, I bet this guy stanned him over MJ"
Hope Kyle Anderson ends up with a contender. The guy just knows how to play basketball despite his athletic limitations.
"Kyle Kuzma, hate that guy…"
"Dear Mr. I-choke-too-much-to-win-a-championship   This'll be the last time I ever support your ass   It's been 3 years and no win, we don't deserve it?   I know you got some talent   But don't think you're perfect   So this is my cry of anger I'm sending, I hope you hear it   I'm in the gym right now, shooting 90 from the line   Hey Kyle, I just made a 3, how hard is it?   You know that performance by DeMar in game 5?   That guy that could've saved himself from choking   But didn't, then Monta have it all , then at the gym he found it   That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued yourself from choking   Now it's too late, the whole fanbase is now a bunch of downers now, I'm drowsy   And all I wanted was your good stroke, that's all   I hope you know I burned your jersey on my wall   I loved you, Kyle, I was hoping you could come through for us and have it   You ruined it now, I hope you get swept and dream about Paul Pierce   And when you dream   I hope you lose sleep and you scream about him   I hope Dragic feasts off you   And you can't do shit next season   See, Kyle, shut up, JV, I'm tryna talk   Hey, Kyle, that's your best playoff performer screamin' in my trunk   But I didn't make him choke, because he's not like you   Cause if he chokes, the fanbase will suffer more and it'll be blamed on you too   Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now   Oh shit, how am I supposed to send this shit out?"
"As a Cavs fan I get it. When we are hunting titles the narrative is about how teams are going to support our title run by giving us their key role players for picks and fringe players.   Now we are the team that’s supposed to be giving away nice assets to fuel others’ dreams.   The reason this particular dream is delusional is that Sexton isn’t 2017 Kyle Korver (who was a stud player, btw). He’s a young guy putting up an efficient 24 ppg and we control his contract."
Kyle Guy is the best answer here. Trae will eventually be old but unless Kyle makes some profound life choices then Guy he shall remain.
Kyle is certainly a guy
Kyle Guy
"&gt;Demar was not better than Kyle Lowry that year. The next year sure but not in 15-16. Lowry was basically scoring the same amount while being the primary playmaker and a better defender.  You are correct. I was thinking of the '16-'17 season when DeMar put up 27/5/4 and took them to 3rd in the East.  &gt;Just cause you aren’t the best guy on your team doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be all nba &gt; someone who is alone on a team lol.  When it's Lowry or Klay vs. James Harden no you don't.  &gt;His longevity isn’t as good then if he gets hurt during the season you are trying to use as a example of his longevity being the same as Bron LOL  Oh so Lebron has never been injured before? Only played 55 games at age 34, must not have longevity."

"Jordan Poole, Modey Moosey, Kyle Guy."
Let’s ignore Trey Murphy absolutely lighting it up and instead talk about how Kyle Fucking Guy is about to become a father.
"This is correct based on the rules but the rules are also wacky.  Either way, they called a Kyle Guy 3 even though the shot clock expired before it left his hand in the 4th so the score is wrong regardless"
Kyle Guy
&gt;I know every guy in the NBA can beat me in a 3/4 court sprint.  Giving Brook Lopez and Kyle Anderson a bit too much credit here.
"I agree that he shouldn't have promised those things, it was a stupid move. I also thinks JJ just needs to accept the move, why should he get special treatment in the NBA? You have to be good enough to be worth that kind of trouble and JJ isn't. NBA teams treat fringe guys like trash - Kyle Guy got cut and didn't get a phone call. There are guys who would kill for the position JJ is in. JJ has been on a bunch of teams, why does this one owe him anything?"
Kyle Guy
"Lord knows he ain't Kyle ""basketball court"" Guy"
"Everyone knows we're not going to the Finals, heck maybe not even the second round. Is everything just about winning the whole damn thing or tanking? If that's the case, the Sixers/Suns/Clippers/one of the Nets or Bucks should just pack it in. What's the point, right? Trade everything for draft picks, so we can draft the next Jarrett Culver (no offense Wolves fans). Also, don't forget about cap space flexibility™, that shits important. Go ask Miami how vital that is, oh wait-  These guys talk about the Bulls like we're getting DeMar and Vooch as the chosen ones to lead us to the promise land. Like our front office is that naïve. That's not the point of all of this. The idea is to raise the floor for Zach to flourish and re-sign, while we also try to compete until Pat Will develops into the player the front office aspires him to be a few years from now (maybe something between Siakam-Paul George level?), AS WELL AS being a destination for free agents. It's no coincidence Lonzo and DeMar chose us. The culture is changing. Players are keeping a close eye. If we're spicy next year, we should be in the running for superstars in the future (just a coincidence that Vooch's contract expires the same year as Jokic's. It's a great bet that if Jokic enters free agency, AK, the guy that brought him over to the NBA, will try his damndest to bring the Joker in      Why is it that when Miami does shit-- zero draft picks in the future, signs Jimmy Butler to a 4-year max contract (someone who freaking got outscored by Bryn Forbes in the Playoffs mind you), commit 90 million each to a 35-year old Kyle Lowry and one dimensional Duncan Robinson, as well as throwing out their MLE to a zero on offense PJ Tucker-- it's all good. Pat Riley is a genius. #HeatCulture. I don't hate the Heat or their moves, just sucks that there's a double standard      But when we do the same shit, experts hate it. Zach is only 26, Pat Will is only 19, Lonzo is only 23. We're still a young team. We just got guys to raise the floor for these guys to succeed, while also changing the infrastructure for future free agents who would want to come here"
Kyle “locker room” Guy
I don’t think making the Hall of Fame exclusive is a bad thing though. For example Kyle Lowry has an 84% chance according to basketball reference and he’ll probably make it after that title. But personally I don’t think he’s ever been a top 10 guy either and wouldn’t put him in.
"I know we love to write off players when they play bad in Summer League games but we have to come into the conclusion that the Summer League for some reason is not a good indicator whether a guy is a bust or a star.  Kyle Kuzma was the summer league MVP and couldn't do shit 3 years later. Some people even said he's better than Tatum during his rookie season.   Trae Young played like shit in SL and to be fair, with his stature and gamestyle, he did scream ""bust"" coming into the league. Now he lead his squad in the WCF and took the Champs to 7 games.   So while I praise Sengun now, there is a high possibility that his impact might be minimal to none once he gets real NBA minutes."
"He's living up to his name, Kyle ""Warrior's Killer"" Guy."
Tobias Harris. - this guy shrinks under pressure  Kyle Lowry.  PJ Tucker.  Pat Bev.
What? Check the box score Kuminga only had one turnover all game  Kyle Guy shot 4/10  Kyle Guy really played well but also shot us out of the game at the end
"This was the play of the game for him. Unfortunately happened on our Moody, but I think it was mainly on Kyle Guy. When ya need a scapegoat, Kyle's your guy."
Kyle Guy. And that’s it  Kyle Guy ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"I'm not that high on Barnes. I think that Toronto just made the mistake that Orlando's been making for years becoming enamored with the long athletic tweener forward (fluctuating between the 3 and the 4) types because in theory they do so much. In practice who fits that description and is an all star level guy? Kawhi and Tatum, there's a tier difference between those 2 and then Pascal Siakam, and then theres another drop off in that archetype of player down to Tobias Harris, maybe a time ago Carmelo Anthony and Paul Millsap? I leave LeBron and KD off here (and I really dont feel comfortable with Tatum being in this category either) because they were uber skilled players before they were switchable defensive pieces. They're just so talented and uniquely built that you put them on the floor and build a lineup around them and if they end up the 4 instead of the 3 then youre not mad about it because they're the best player on the floor 90% of the time anyways.  Whereas I feel like over the last 20 years the high energy and high IQ  point guard has been a consistent floor raising guy that you always see on playoff teams. Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Jrue had some bad teams in New Orleans but him too. Go back a decade or more and throw guys like Tony Parker and prime Kidd on there too.  Idk i felt this since draft night I feel like Toronto outsmarted themselves with Barnes. He may end up being a good player and long switchable wings definitely don't grow on trees. I also may end up entirely wrong but I feel like we've talked ourselves into the archetype of Barnes in the mid/high lottery before and it ended up being a stinker pick."
The game ended with quite a few Shaqtin moments. Kyle Guy just suddenly eating shit too. Rooks played well though!
RIP Kyle Guy
Kyle Guy lol
Hey GSW we've reconsidered.    We'll do a straight swap of Pascal Siakam for Kyle Guy.  Give us a call when you get a chance.
"He worked on them but not to the same degree as the other skills that he felt were important to him (mid-range game &amp; handles). He idolized Kobe and wanted to perfect all of his mid-range moves. I don't fault him for that, he's still a tremendous player, but i'm just saying that it's not like Derozan was a guy that did whatever it took for the team to win. He didn't dive on the court for loose balls, take charges or any of those things that we loved Lowry for. IMO Kyle was the unselfish one out of the two. Derozan was still a great guy, but he wanted to play the game his way."
"There are issues with the stats you're posting, but to be fair to you I was vague, so I'll get more specific.  I've come to determine Win Shares proper to be a worthless metric, as it tends to broadly overrate certain stats, and I remember a couple seasons ago it making out JaVale and Dwight's WS/48 to be near that of LeBron's.  BPM and its accumulative form in VORP are the best publicly-available all-in-one metric that I know of that only uses box stats, but it still only uses box stats.  TS, FTR, and TOV% are going to overlap for the most part with BPM/VORP.  The advanced metrics I've come to most regard are RPM and on-off per 100 possessions.  RPM's calculation is secret, at last check, but I believe that it predominantly uses +/-, and seemed pretty accurate with teams or players I've followed closely.  For instance it shows LeBron as having a much higher number than AD the past two seasons, which is accurate for anyone who watched the Lakers a lot, and you'd never be able to tell by looking at their box stats (which make them look mostly equal).  It's also made out Steph Curry to be especially good, and it showed when the Dubs last season won something like 60% of their games with him and went 2-8 without.  OOP100 can be jank even with an entire season's worth of games, and for role players generally, but DeRozan's predominantly played starter minutes and has been in the league a long time, and I'll be looking at a large sample size for him.  DeRozan's RPM the last 3 seasons in reverse-order is:  -0.83, -1.39, and -0.28.  His career OOP100 regular season is -2.8, with the last 3 seasons of 61-77 games each was even worse at -4.6 average.  That's.... awful.  Kyle Kuzma has a better OOP100.  Based on these numbers, the dude's not even properly worth an MLE to most teams.  I've barely watched the guy, but apparently there's a big empty-stats aspect to his game.  We weren't really arguing about Lowry, but I'll look up his like-numbers anyway.  His RPM the last 3 seasons is 4.02, 5.21, and 5.88.  Those are basically superstar numbers.  I won't cite his career OOP100 since he's getting old, but the last three seasons average:  +4.2 in 169 games.    DeMar's health has been better and he's younger, but +/- advanced metrics show that the two players that the two players are nowhere near each other in on-court impact, that Lowry's probably worth his new contract, and DeMar might be the most overrated player in the game."
You are concerned the guy that moves like Kyle Andersen and Lonzo’s lovechild was out there displaying his slow feet?
Its a guy youve never heard of. It can't be Kyle Singler because he was getting playing time.
"“Did LA give up too much to get a guy who has been called a stat padder, even though he averages a triple double, which only one other player has done?”  “Is that a trick question? They gave up KYLE KUZMA, who cares?!”"
Hey that Kyle guy is not bad
"Good guy Kyle Lowry knew the Heat wouldn’t give up a pick by choice, so he tampered with them to ensure that the league gives Miami’s 2022 1st to Toronto"
"&gt; Guy hasn't moved the needle for a single team he's been a part of. &gt;  &gt;   Literally became one of the best teams in the league for nearly half a decade with him and Kyle leading the team, made a massive impact culturally by becoming the first star who stayed, mentored the young guys who're now picking up the reins (there's a reason every young guy who has since left shouted out Demar's mentorship in their leaving messages, that Freddie and Pascal regularly shout him out even now)."
"The most regular season wins of all time, but definitely not the “winningest” team of all time. That goes to the Russell Celtics or MJ Bulls.   Best spot up shooter is probably Kyle Korver. This guy shot over 49% over the course of a season on 6 attempts per game. Obviously Klay is by far the better player because he has far greater defense and the better overall offensive package being able to cut to the rim, relocate, better utilizer of screens.   It was a team that lost in the finals to a superteam, and it was unlikely KD would have won a championship elsewhere without forming a superteam of his own. Why put in the risk and trouble of recruiting for a superteam when he can instantly create one by joining the second best team in the league? Do we discredit LeBron for Miami, Cleveland, and now LA with Westbrook and AD? The only time LeBron won a championship without two other all-stars was last year when he had a top 5 two way superstar with DPOY caliber defense. And that was statistically one of the easiest paths to a championship in 30 years because of COVID.   I agree that the optics were terrible, but it was a good business decision and honestly his only choice if he wanted a ring ASAP. In practice it’s really no different than what LeBron did, he just didn’t do the recruiting himself."
"Yeah shockingly if you make a guy that's an on ball scorer/facilitator play like Kyle korver, he struggles  Imagine telling LeBron to go sit in the corner all game and then acting surprised when he shoots 2-7"
"You're stripping this down to years played.  I'm looking at level of play.  You point to Ewing's contract, making a third of the cap. But you forget that the Knicks actually wanted to dump that contract because of Ewing's decline in level of play.   I'm not comparing a guy who signed a big deal in his prime and that last year of the contract was decline; I'm comparing guys who are already at that age of decline playing at a high enough level that teams are throwing a third of the cap space at them.   I'm talking Kyle Lowry getting nearly a third of the Heat's cap space. CP3 doing the same in Phoenix.   LeBron set to make nearly 50 mil at the age of 39.   These kinds of deals, in this volume, for players at this age in the NBA is not standard fair. Teams who are loyal to big ticket franchise players like Bird, Magic, Ewing. Sure. But a team dropping that kind of money on a 36-year-old free agent whose never played for them before? No.   In comparison, the Heat (same GM) only gave Tim Hardaway 2.5 mil a year back in 97, and Hardaway was 29 and considered to be on the down slope of his career by that time.    There's lots of examples. Mark Price. Kevin Johnson. Marbury. Francis. Earl Monroe played his best ball before 26 and made his last all-star game at the age of 32, even though he hung around a few more years.   Barkley was a shell of his former self after the age of 32. Hakeem was done as an All-Star by 35.   There is also the fact that the Bulls opted not to re-sign Pippen and Rodman after the 98 title because they thought they were too old.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm looking at Duncan, who was an All-Star at 38. Who made All-NBA and All-Defensive at 38.   At the Age of 36, with 15 years logged, Kareem dropped a less than 22/8/3 a game. At that same age with 18 years in the league, LeBron was dropping 25/7.7/7.8.   Nobody else was playing that well at that age back then outside of Kareem. And he managed to keep it up until 38 (at least scoring wise with 23 a game) before a noticeable slide.   But he wasn't tanking in the top five in any major statistical categories, like Paul and LeBron have over the last couple of years.   &amp;#x200B;  Sure, there have always been pine pickers like Charles Jones and Herb Williams kicking around until their 40, but that's not what I'm talking about here.   &amp;#x200B;  If you don't think that there are more players playing into their late 30s with significant roles and minutes than there have been in past generations, then we simply aren't talking about the same sport."
"&gt; Woz: ""I think the first one is, the Jrue thing... there's context here. The contract is coming up, they didn't want to pay him all the money the bucks would pay him when they thought the time line with zion was one thing, right?"" [...] That's how you see the whole, 'Alright, we're willing to pay 90 million for Kyle Lowry,' which was the market rate for the guy, but not give Jrue Holiday his 130 million dollar contract to be better and younger.  .  &gt; Simmons: ""How about keep Jrue Holiday and grab Myles turner a year ago and call it a day. That would've been nice.""  They're certainly not talking like people who understand that Jrue requested a trade."
Yes. J Kyle is a max guy. He has a very under rated. Youtube game. He's sneakily entertaining.
"Cannot stand Wos, his takes are just nothing takes and he laughs at his jokes for 4 minutes. He can also be really nasty towards certain players for no reason.  Logan isn't as bad but he really needs to drop the whole 'Im a black guy so I have to try to act cool' schtick.  Bill is entertaining but his takes are getting worse and worse by the pod, I think he has figured out what sells and is leaning into that too much.  KOC is great analysis but he never wants to have a solid take on anything, he needs Verno to push him   Favs are Russillo and J Kyle Mann."
J Kyle Mann/KOC/Russillo Big 3.  Id probably go with Tjarks and Seerat in the Ray Allen/Chalmers roles respectively.    But j kyle is a max guy. Ppl sleeping on him in here.
"People gloss over how elite DeMar is. His footwork is some of the best in the league, he's crazy athletic, and I remember he was always at the top at being able to draw fouls, only being eclipsed by the beard god harden. Since then he has developed some pretty great playmaking, and has shored up some of his issues on defense. People say he's bad on defense but I think that's just a stigma that we've gotten used to repeating, no way someone with this much experience, that good footwork, with that crazy athleticism is going to be terrible at defense. The way he can regularly produce a large amount of buckets without any help if he really has to is pretty top level and brings a ton of iso threat on the offense for his team. He was a pretty big ball stopper on ball movement while he was on the raptors, that was probably our biggest issue with him but pop really ironed that out of him it looks like by making him run point for a while on the spurs. The guy has only gotten better the last couple years, so I'm glad people are starting to notice him and look forward to how hard he tears it up on the bulls. The notion of how DeMar should take a pay cut to play on good teams was pretty crazy to me, he could easily be the second best player on a championship team. Im fully convinced if you put him on a team like the nuggets, blazers, or clippers instead of Jamal Murray/cj/Paul George that's easily a championship team. don't get me wrong, he was definitely a negative on the raptors because he didn't fit our offense well (could possibly have been a coaching issue too) and had his defensive issues but I think even the current DeMar would be great on the raptors (especially if Kyle wasn't leaving) and better than ever with how he's improved on all his issues, even if he produced less points for us now."
Kyle Guy is only 1 person
"On a scale of LeBron James to Kyle Guy, he’s probably at Spencer Dinwiddie"
"I’m going to get downvoted but I’ve only really watched dame in the playoffs and imo he’s not a #1 guy. There’s no way Portland could ever win with him on the supermax and I’m tired of seeing people say they should have made better moves.   Chris Paul needed two amazing young talents just to make the finals after years of struggling to get there, Kyrie couldn’t do it without lebron, Kyle Lowry couldn’t do it without kawhi. Undersized pg just can’t lead championship teams unless their name is steph Curry. And even then that happened thru the draft, not by making moves (talking about before KD got there).   Dame has always been overvalued imo and it’s because he’s just not in a position as a undersized pg to take over and win games when others aren’t performing."
"That’s a good argument for why an owner should go into the tax to get Kyrie, Harden and KD, and not such a good argument for why an owner should go way deeper in the tax for Kyle Kuzma.   If you want to take this down the business route, it’s about ROI. How much closer does Kuzma get the Nets to a ring? Do you really think it’s close enough that throwing an extra $100M on a guy (or two) like him is THAT likely to bring the team a championship?"
Maybe they can throw in kyle guy to lighten their load.
"Lakers reportedly had interest. Chicago been wanting him. Knicks had interest. Rumors of Clippers. Hornets, admittedly probably low or not at all. That’s 4-5 teams. The fleece was over you guys. You guys lost one of your talents, at at the very least a guy who could’ve been traded at the deadline, and got nothing in return. NOLA can’t even sign 35yo Kyle Lowry or THJ so the chances of getting a big FA are low. FA weren’t flocking when AD, a generational talent and one of the best PF, so they not gonna come flocking when Zion’s future is tentative. With all that y’all better hope BI don’t just decide to leave"
"You’d think then knowing it’s hard to get notable FA to come to NOLA that they should look to keep their talent and let it grow, see how it pans out. Instead y’all bet everything on getting a 35yo Kyle Lowry against Miami. Now you’re gonna hype Graham up like he’s a beast? How do these recent events look in Zion’s eyes? He doesn’t get to play with his boy, sad but not horribly so. The package they got for Zo was significantly worse than what interest for Zo was. The team failed to get Kyle Lowry because FA aren’t running to NOLA, and then THJ took less to stay in Dallas.   If I’m Zion all I see is a team that traded a guy I wanted away for (being generous) another guy who is essentially the same, but less interest in the FA market. More salary cap space but no agents to come here, and less trade bait so less likely trading for a guy at the deadline. Add on top of that my 3rd coach in 3 years and my family wanting me to play elsewhere."
This the guy that Kyle Lowry literally blocked on Twitter 😂
"He might not be in a Raptors jersey anymore, but the disrespect of putting Kyle Lowry in the same tier as Fox and Morant is simply silly.  We're talking about a guy who headlined this year's FA along with Chris Paul as THE targets for Championship teams."
I think Jonas was better than Kyle Anderson this year. Sure he’s a post-up guy but that’s a massive improvement over Steven Adams who I genuinely believe was scared to shoot layups this year.   The Vucevic move was considered an overpay because they gave Orlando a pretty decent pick and a pick that was an uncertainly as we don’t know if the bulls were/are really gonna be good in 2023. The lakers should be good next year barring major disaster though in my opinion which makes giving up their pick passable for me
Jonas was best offensive guy with morant out but I think many grizzlies fans would argue Kyle Anderson was the most consistent.  Someone free to correct me since I didn’t watch many of their games but guessing you haven’t either.  I do know his game is definitely not versatile on either end of the court however.  He’s a post up guy mainly and isn’t too mobile defending them perimeter.  An expiring can easily leave after a year too.  A pick swap and a 1st rder even a projected late one is not insignificant or you’re saying harden fetched basically nothing for houston.  Vucevic an all star lvl big with multiple years left cost “only” 2 picks and that was considered an overpay by many analysts.
"2013/4 - 2017/8  Kyle Lowry 19.0/4.9/6.9, .388 3P%, .577 TS%, 50.7 Ws, 5.0 BPM, 22.7 VORP   Demar DeRozan 23.4/4.5/4.2, .304 3P%, .542 TS%, 41.3 WS, 1.9 BPM, 13.1 VORP  Seriously how is Demar better at all?  Lowry is the better floor and ceiling raiser it is not even a question.  Raptor fans liked Demar more because he was homegrown plus there were a bunch of vocal fans who didn't like Lowry's whining to refs and obviously his constant problems with Casey while Demar is just a likeable guy who they saw grow up from terrible in his first few years to a star."
"Lol I had a few people like myself. The other side gives off a subtle scent of something burnt. Close your eyes Kyle, it won't cure it but at least we have the best buffet! Wtf?!? Can’t replace him properly then and it cost us, I really like it. Shoots average from three and the Celtics defensive rating was a lot more money over the next decade, and the guy we were sharing a bathroom with had been using them on FIFA for a few hours for me to go and do what I couldn’t stop trying to shame people with low incomes for having either of them could speak more than one of these fucking people has a GoFundMe to help them keep going. And going for a later period with the qipaos. Either way a chip would be cool!"
"Khem Birch, Jeff Teague, Kyle Guy, TJ Leaf - The one syllable options are out there!"
"Schröder is a good starter and wants 20-25m a year. Thats a a player friendly contract but for sure not an overpay if the fit is right. If it wasn't for Lakers fans/media building the narrative around him nobody would make these pointless claims and drag him through the mud.   He must be the only roleplayer that had a bad (or horrible) game when he has to be the #1 guy. What do we expect from a good starter? You can't tell a guy:  ""Oh btw AD is out LBJ is playing injured and without that much motivation and besides those guys your only help is Andre Drummond and Kyle Kuzma. Now go out there and drop a nice 25 and 6 while having to create almost everything completly on your own against one of the leagues best defenses""  If that is your expectation for a solid starter than you're just delusional. Starters don't do shit like that Allstars do."
Yeah we lost Kyle Guy. Fuck
"No it's even worse than that. They didn't have to attach a useful player in George Hill and a draft pick for Steven Adams. Then even worse, extending Adams when you're not sure he would fit with Zion. None of this is playing the result either, these were bad ideas at the time. Dell Demps at least traded for Jrue. Griffin's two best moves have been trading for Kyle Korver and trading Waiters for JR Smith and Shump. What a fucking disaster of a GM.  [“And I was the one on campus at UNLV,” he added. “I’m the one who got sold the bill of goods and I bought it hook, line, and sinker. You f— up sometimes. But I feel bad [ex-Cavs GM] Chris [Grant] took it for that, because Chris was the one guy who wasn’t sure.”](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/david-griffin-admits-f-up-drafting-anthony-bennett/404567) How do you let this fucking idiot run a  billion dollar enterprise is baffling."
"lol you're right, probably a guy like Kyle Korver then.  Also likeable and good at his job as a role player, and i think hes played for like 7 different teams"
Apparently that's what Kyle wants as well.  To be THEE GUY in free agency for a few days.
How about that Kyle Lowry guy. He seems good
"I honestly think we've earned a solid player development rep. If I were a prospect or someone on the precipice of being out of the NBA, I'd definitely see if the Spurs were interested in signing me for cheap just to develop and try to carve out a role.  Think of all the dudes who got great second contracts after playing for SA.  Beno Udrih - drafted 28th overall, played decent minutes as a rookie as the backup PG for a title winning team in 05. We trade him to Minne in his final year of his rookie deal to cut costs, he ends up as a FA and signs with SAC, who then extend him on a 5 year 32mil deal.  Ian Mahinmi - he barely plays with us, but we keep him on the roster for 3 years. He signs a minimum deal with DAL, then winds up being part of a S&amp;T to Indiana on a 4/16mil deal. Eventually makes bank with a 4/64mil deal with the Wizards in the dreaded 2016 off-season.  George Hill - we took a chance on him when other teams were scared off due to IUPUI being deemed too small of a school. He develops, we trade him again in the final year of his deal and signs multiple high $ contracts over a very long career.  Gary Neal - a guy we brought in from overseas, who I think was 26 at the time, signed a 3 year contract for relative peanuts with team outs after the first season. His total earnings from SA were only ~2mil over 3 seasons, but then he signed a 2 year 6.5mil deal with MIL, then another 1 year deal for the vet min with the Wizards, which because he had been an NBA vet for 5 years at that point was a little over 2mil  DeJuan Blair - made 4mil on his rookie deal over 4 years with SA, then made another 4.5mil while bouncing around the league another 3 years.  Kyle Anderson - develop him into a great roleplayer, he signs a solid deal with Memphis that he's actually out-performed and is in line for a bigger pay day on his next deal.  Johnathon Simmons - probably the best example of this trend. He literally walked-on to try out for the (at the time) Austin Toros. The FO sees something in him and signs him to a 2 year deal with most of the money unguaranteed. He makes the most of his opportunities in 16 and 17, playing great defense on Harden in the playoffs and doing enough on offense to take advantage of Harden's defense. Signs a 3/24 with Orlando.  This isn't even counting guys like Danny Green and Patty Mills, who were claimed off the waiver wire and have ended up earning a ton while becoming fantastic players."
"This is pretty disingenuous nobody considered jeff teague, kyle korver (who was an injury replacement), paul millsap and Al Horford legitimate ""stars"" that year  That guy might be a russ hater idk but I dont see how two superstars being AD and LeBron (both who are imo top 10 players) along with russ who with his flaws is still a star player in this league   Its a superteam and I'm not afraid to admit that"
"The Pelicans are desperately trying not to fumble Zion and in the process are fumbling Zion.   Do you think that in four years when Zion is a RFA he’s going to gladly sign a max extension to play with the corpse of fucking Kyle Lowry? No, fuck no.   I’m not saying Zo is the move but Jesus don’t tie your future star to these must win now Vets that are on the wrong side of thirty. You have assets make a move for a younger guy and make sure you have the pieces to make them all happy."
"Kyle Kuzma on setting the Lakers record for most threes bricked: ""This guy next to me will be the next one."" The guy next to him is Dennis Shroder."
"Josh Primo is a top 10 guy in this draft, Kuminga is the best player from this draft, Bouknight becomes a superstar, and McBride is the next Kyle Lowry"
"You forgot Terrence Davis, Justin James and Kyle Guy.   And like 20 more undrafted guards. We have all the guards now."
"Leonard in the finals was 15/42 , siakim was 5/21 , gasol was 6/19. Plus everyone of those guys you would almost rather them shoot the 3 then work it inside for a shot.  That's how good Leonard and siakim were in the lane and mid-range that year. Gasol is going to be open because of help off of screens and if you lose via him hitting 3s that's something you can live with. But you can see how besides Leonard, when the lights get brighter the 3 gets harder to hit. The shooting from Fred and Kyle are absolutely what helped them win the championship, I'm just trying to say that 1 guy that can't shoot the 3 ball isn't going to ruin your team especially when he can do so many other things well. Because Lebron is a career 34 percent and Davis is 31 percent from 3 with Davis being much better the last few years. So they aren't people that in theory hurt your spacing but they are like kawhi and siakim that you'd rather they shoot the 3."
just backups for kyle guy
How do people just lie and get upvoted on here? The guy got traded for the worst contract in the league twice in a row and just got traded for kyle fucking kuzma  This guy is suppose to be an “MVP”
I'm guessing Kyle Guy is getting traded because that's a lot of people in the backcourt
"Yeah the lakers need a another guard that can create, but also shoot. You ever heard of a guy named Kyle Lowry? Lmao  You are fooling yourself that the Westbrook experiment will be successful like the last two teams that traded him."
Mavs gonna try and outbid everyone for 35yr old Kyle Lowry.  That's how you know Cuban is still running the team.  He just hired a guy with better player/agent connections.
Yup! You'll miss Kyle Lowry a lot less with that guy in a Raptors uniform. Torch passed. He'll be in a Drake lyric by the end of the weekend. LoL. Absolute only thing I don't know about is his fit with FVV but you guys would know more than I would
Kyle Anderson is probably the guy their offering the Warriors. They'd have to take Looney back to make it work. Anderson is another expiring like Valanciunas and he's going to be getting a raise. Grizzlies probably want someone closer to Ja &amp; Jackson's age range rather than spending 12M or so on Anderson.
"I don't understand this infatuation with Kyle Lowry. Is it just because it's a weak free agent class? The guy is 35 years old and had a long history of playoff chokes until 2019. He's solid defensively, but he's a mediocre playmaker. Do people really think he's going to have a Chris Paul-like late career resurgence?"
Kyle Lowry is not Chris Paul or anything close.  Love the guy but is he a top 15 PG now?  Not for me…
"Kyle Lowry…..  3/14  7/14  3/7  1/3  If all y’all’s best players played bad because they shot low percentages from the field, then there is no way you would have swept, right?  Or maybe…just maybe….shooting 42% as the first option in a playoff series on 20 ppg isn’t actually bad…  80% of first option players will have lower efficiency in the playoffs. That’s just how it works. You can get focused on more, the team learns everything about you, and in this case you are playing four straight games against a top 10 defense then seven straight against a top 4 immediately after, while also being elite on the defensive end. Siakam was not the 27 ppg guy like he was the first few months of that season or whatever, but he was still good. Stop trying to just put him down to raise Lowry up. Lowry does not have an argument against CP3. End of story."
"&gt; I don't see any team trading an all star-caliber PG for any combo of those pieces.   They might if that PG is either an unrestricted free agent who might tell his team to trade him to the Lakers or he'll just walk and leave his team with nothing (i.e. possibly Kyle Lowry or *maybe* Chris Paul), or if that PG is incredibly overpaid to where his team might just want to get off his contract (i.e. Kemba Walker or Russell Westbrook). It's not like they could use these pieces for Steph or Dame though, obviously.   &gt; the Lakers don't have many picks to trade.   They have the 22nd pick in this year's draft and their 2027 1st round pick, along with a bunch of 2nds.  &gt; Kuz has seemingly been on the trade market for years now and no trades have materialized.   That's not really accurate, or rather doesn't reflect the truth there. Up until free agency starts and Kuzma's extension kicks in, he'll have been on his rookie contract this whole time, meaning before this season he was on a deal that paid him less than $2 million per year. Just because of the need to match salaries, it's impossible to trade a guy making that little and get anything valuable in return, and at that price the Lakers wanted to keep him and see how he developed. It's tough to get good rotation players for less than the minimum like that.   Once Kuzma signed that extension last off-season it made trading him this year basically impossible because of [the poison pill provision,](https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1340781915226435588?s=19) and because the Lakers were hard capped. This upcoming free agency is really the first time in Kuzma's entire career where it will have made any sense for the Lakers to trade him. That's why nothing has ever materialized. People on here have talked about him getting traded for years, but it has never been realistic before now.   &gt; Lakers aren't really in any position of leverage with the assets they have.   This is wrong for one reason, and it applies to all three players: Bird rights. It's the same reason why Lowry is probably going to be signed and traded rather than just signing as a free agent: because the good teams who might want him are capped out, so he'll need to involve the team that has his Bird rights to get to where he wants to go.   Maybe if Schroder and Caruso get monster offers in free agency from teams they want to play for then they'll leave (as would Kyle Lowry if that happened), but it's highly unlikely that happens. Some shitty team with a lot of cap space isn't going to want to blow it on those guys. The only teams who might want to give them big deals are contenders looking for more depth, but those teams are capped out, and thus would need the Lakers involvement.   THT is a different case because he's [a restricted free agent that is Arenas limited,](https://youtu.be/YdCOrUGdgg8) meaning teams can't offer him more than the MLE, and the Lakers are able to match any offer he gets. So if some team desperately wants him, they probably will need the Lakers involvement as well.   So the Lakers don't have *total* leverage over those guys, but it's wrong to say they ""aren't really in any position of leverage."""
Lol this guy thinks he's Kyle Lowry
Yes with him as the primary ball handler and 1st scoring option   Replace DeMar DeRozan with Kyle Kuzma for his entire career and the teams he’s on don’t make the playoffs my guy   Kuzma is at best an okay 7th man
"I'm more saying DeMar isn't built to be your number one guy, and neither is Kyle. They are better suited for second options."
"I honestly wouldn't worry too much about the 30m ask. 3 years is relatively short plus expirings always have value so it's really just year 2 (fwiw I don't think there'd be a severe decline in play in year 2, his game is way more IQ based than anything else) and injuries that are the worries.  Beyond that, when you look at the going rate for contracts, it's pretty worth it when you consider a Kyle Kuzma getting 13m or Norman Powell/Gary Trent looking for the 18-25 range.  With Lowry you get a ton of desirable skills in a player (shooting, defending, playmaking) as well as a guy who's shown he can carry any random collection of bench guys to great advanced stats and a vocal leader on offense and defense who brings a ton of intangibles."
Okay but you're actually delusional if you think that sixers team that lost to the Hawks were just a Kyle Lowry away from winning a ring. Kyle Lowry was the difference between losing in the second round to losing in 5 to the bucks. Is that worth selling every last asset you have for a guy that could just walk?
"Who was the last all-star wing player to have an athletic profile as poor as Giddey's though?   The only guy I can think of is Kyle Korver and he was an all-star purely based off his knock-down shooting. The only other guy even comparable is Khris Middleton, but I'd say Middleton is still a lot more athletic than Giddey. Giddey's lack of athleticism really puts a cap on how great he can be."
"There’s 42 players in the nba getting paid over 25$ mil next season, is Kyle Lowry won’t a top 42 guy right now?"
No the guy above is correct they swapped positions. The year Kyle for third team all nba he was the #1 guy
"This simply isn't true, it's revision. Demar was the franchise player for the Raptors until he got traded, historical revisionism doesn't work - Kyle was never 'the guy', it's why he'd always be referred to as the 'engine' and stuff.   Who was more impactful and a more complete player is a different conversation."
"Make no mistake, DeMar was seen as the number one guy. Kyle is definitely the more complete player of the two but when you wanted a bucket you went to Deebo"
"This is where Lowe is so off the mark.    &gt;If the Sixers can get a guard some other way. Just in theory if they can sign and trade for Kyle Lowry. They paper over one need. What if they keep Simmons, see how he functions in this ecosystem where we have a legit lead guard, ups his trade value, see what happens in Portland… see what other situation goes haywire and see what happens to Ben Simmons trade value in January or February. I think frankly that makes a lot of sense.”   What happens to Ben Simmons trade value if he comes out next season not shooting jumpers or threes? What is his value 16/8/8 shooting 60% from the line not taking any outside shots? Now you got a guy on a max deal who's a 3rd option at best on playoff team. Right now there's GMs who think...  &gt;He's athletic, he's a great defender, he's a great facilitator, I can fix his jumper, I can fix his foul shooting, I can fix his timidity.    But when he comes out still not shooting, still on a max contract, those GMs start to realize that he's not going to fix those problems. Then they ask themselves exactly what Ben can do for them to justify the cost. And the answer is, Ben is a guy who can't even be on the floor late in a playoff game, while his defense and stat line can be nice, his game is the kiss of death for your playoff chances if you over invest.    Tldr, his trade value will likely go down."
"Definitely. 100%.   The whole American basketball infrastructure is built on the individual. We put a premium on athleticism as opposed to things like IQ, fundamentals, or team play.   It's why a guy like Kyle Anderson will never get commercials or a shoe deal."
"The first word that springs to mind whenever I hear Kyle Korver's name is ""thug"". Glad the league put their time and resources into stopping that guy because he was out of control."
"&gt;VC played his prime years for the Raptors and signed a 6 year extension when his rookie contract was up.  And then he demanded a trade to get out of there. Vince Carter: **Forced his way out of Toronto.**   &gt;He wasn't even a star yet when he left, he was growing into one. He's even admitted after his career that this was the wrong move, looking back he wouldn't stayed with Vince in Toronto.  And yet the fact remains: He was a budding star, and **left Toronto**.   &gt;Bosh also signed an extension with Toronto and played 7 of his best years here. He was a star, but definitely wasn't a superstar player. I would put both DeMar and Kyle on the same level and they also both played here for 8-10 years each by choice.  LMAO now this is some revisionist bullshit. Bosh on the same level with Lowry and DeMar, HAHAHA. Literally the only reason Bosh wasn't perennial All-NBA second team at least is cus he played in Toronto on bum teams. When he signed with Miami it was a huge deal precisely because it was 3 superstars joining forces together. Bosh was a superstar and he **left Toronto**.  Just like Kawhi **left Toronto**.   Four superstars, and all **left Toronto.**  You just hate to see it. Especially since Our guy stayed™"
"People are really stretching these days for big 3's.  Does old man Kyle Lowry count in a big 3 cuz he made all nba 3rd team one time 5 years ago?  I really like Bam, but has he done enough to be a ""big 3"" guy?   If Jimmy butler is the 3rd guy in you big 3 you've got an amazing team. If he's the best guy in your big 3 tho?"
"Well said. He would absolutely be getting tons of positive admiration if he was on a rebuilding team in a bigger role.   The Lakers could have traded him for Kyle fucking Lowry. That tells me that they really believe the guy has all star potential (which I do as well) and can be the Lakers point guard going forward after Lebron is gone.   It’s a tough spot for a young point guard, he’s best on ball, but he’s most needed off ball. Hopefully he’s benefiting from being around Lebron, Rondo, Westbrook and that makes up for the lack of applicable playing time he’ll get.  And maybe in the long run, he’ll benefit from this time and improve his off ball shooting and cutting and defense a lot."
"I too didn't buy into the bench much, especially not beyond like 6,7,8. Like when we had to depend on Kyle Bowman? Love the guy but....  (Don't get me started on Jacob Evans)"
"Kyle can be that guy maybe once or twice in a series, he's too old to do it consistently. Herro totally can be that guy, people hate him so much it's become irrational at this point."
"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jusjl1MsV-A  I said Kyle “can” be that guy. He clearly can take over games if needed. I also said Herro can become that guy, he’s already shown plenty of flashes of being a clutch player"
"Kyle can be that guy too, maybe Herro in the coming years"
"Why do you think it’s Bc “he doesn’t want to be anyone else”? You don’t think if he could, he’d be Lebron or Curry? It’s just not that easy, if it were there’d be more Lebrons and Curry’s. Do you believe a guy like Dame is a hard worker? He’ll never be on Curry’s level, not Bc he doesn’t want too. It’s not the norm for 6’11+ guys to turn into shooters. I agree he needs to be more aggressive, but that’s also very hard for pass first guys (CP3 even said he struggles with it on Gil’s podcast recently, said Book would have to tell him all the time to stop passing).   What do you believe Giannis added to his game? I think he greatly improved on what he already had. He came into the league shooting, he didn’t just randomly start one season like people want Simmons to do (bringing up shooting Bc that’s the main point people make about Simmons).   What is his comfort zone? I believe players should play to their strengths, and that’s what Simmons does. We don’t ask Kyle Korver to put the ball on the floor and create, we just ask him to shoot Bc that’s what he’s good at. We don’t ask PJ Tucker to get in the post and work down low, he sits in the corner and plays D Bc that’s what he’s good at. We don’t ask Capela to develop a post game or learn how to shoot, we tell him to set screens, roll, and catch lobs Bc that’s what he’s good at. So why try to transform Simmons into something he’s not, instead of having him do what he’s good at? Again, Giannis was already shooting when he came into the league. Simmons NEVER shot in the league.   The 6ers roster construction was poor. Instead of getting an actual PG, they tried to turn Simmons into a shooting Pg for 4 years, which is insane to me.   Do you think Luka and Bron don’t shoot 80%+ from the FT line Bc they don’t want too?"
Kyle Anderson is actually the fastest guy in the league. He moves so fast it looks like he is in slow motion to the human eye
"Morey ""basketball genius/Money-ball savant""ed himself out of Harden and a package including Kyle Lowry. Good luck smart guy"
I think slightly more surprising is Kyle Korver having what 2 dunks in his career? At 6’8”   I also recall Korver being a decent shot blocker for a guy that can’t jump over a phone book  Edit - I just looked it up and apparently Korver actually had *20* dunks in his career and I’m still picking my jaw up off the floor after learning that fact
"Your logic is just simply amazing my guy  KEVIN LOVE ALL STAR YAY, JR SMITH posts percentage, old ass Kyle Korver, fucking Rodney Hood  You just proved why it was such a big deal, go look at the stats of those players in the playoffs"
For a big men al horford. Hes been a simple yet effective and winning player his whole career. He can pop out and hit a 3 or start the offense at the top of the key or in the post. He knows how to move his feet so he rarely gets cooked on switches and is strong enough to handle most guys in the league. I think hes a great guy to look at since hes not an uber athletic/skilled center but still more than gets the job done. For wings id say gordan hayward plays basketball like every coaches dream just a shame hes never healthy. He almost always makes the right play and doesnt have any holes in his game. Shooting guards it has to be klay. A sniper that gets his looks moving off ball and is a pest on defense. And for pgs kyle lowry. Lowry is small and hasnt always been an amazing player but hes gotten better every year and has really made himself to be one of the most effective guards in the league at both ends. For guys a little taller jrue holiday.   Tldr: guys that play both ends and dont force it on offense
"Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marcus smart? My bias wants to say Kyle Lowry is different but these guys all hype the shit outta teammates and are annoying as hell to anyone who isn't but also they're going back you up or pull you out of any situations  Edit: saw someone say Steven Adams, that's probably the guy"
"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."
"nobody has ever suggested anyone other than kawhi was ""the guy"" in 2019 lol. This is about after that.   Nobody said he's lying about it, I'm saying he didn't have to be sat down and told he's ""the guy"" now. He was the next leading scorer after kawhi in 2019, he got paid max money that off-season, and he was even playing that role as our #1 guy to start the 19/20 season.   he said kyle was even telling him that he's ""the guy"".   &gt; because him being the primary option was something that happened out of necessity not the result of a plan.  what does that even mean? When we paid him, the plan was for him to be our #1 guy, or at least to be one of the best players on the team along with FVV and lowry.   This isn't even about being the guy, it's just playing his game and improving every year. He doesn't need to be anyone he's not, him playing his game the best he could would be enough. But that isn't something he has always done consistently. He's still learning that part of it, being consistent on a nightly basis."
"i dont think it has anything to do with lowry..pascal was dominating the beginning of 2020..he just had ebbs and flows with his performance, and kyle isnt some 20 and 10 guy himself"
"It's an issue with confidence. It's hard to be the guy when you have someone like Kyle Lowry, one of the longest tenured Raptors at that point, still making and taking charge."
"yea that was weird  he started the season after the ring on fire anyways. He started that 2020 season playing so well, and that was without anyone telling him he's the guy.   if the organization paid you, and if kyle was saying you're the guy, what more do you need?"
"&gt;Obviously, Kyle was there, being a point guard. Kyle was, to me, always the greatest Raptor of all time. I think he was always like, “I was the guy.” I had the contract, but I never really felt like I was the guy, to be honest.  &gt;&gt;You wanted them to say, “You know, here’s the max contract. You’re the guy. You’re the centerpiece that’s going to take us to the repeat championship.”  &gt;Yeah. I never really felt like there was that. And I think those conversations are happening now.  You were supposed to take the keys, Pascal, not wait for someone to hand them too you. Your play was supposed to define you as ""the guy,"" not your contract."
"They did an incredible job.  Wall hadn't played in 2 years, reached his max already as a player, and they got that for a guy who was coming off an injury but is always at least a force and a draw and you never have to worry about him mentally competing.  Then they essentially took Wall and a protected first into  Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' No. 22    The only losers in this are the Rockets. Which under the new owner slowly disengrated a team he inherited in the first place to now chasing off a team President, GM, Ass Gms, Coach, Ass Coach, STars and Role players and ended last year in the bottom of the seeds and almost set a record for multiple losses in a row.   They at least have a yougn direction now, but wow Houston fans got Dollar Value Dolan.  Same Bullshit and Ego, but the reality show version with all talk and no action."
"If Kyle Anderson can make it in this league, I don't see why someone shouldn't give this guy a shot."
"It’s also not in Dragic’s interest to be bought out. He’s much better off if somebody has his bird rights. If he’s bought out, he becomes a minimum salary guy here on out.  For context, in case you didn’t notice, Two 36 year old guards just got ~$350m in guaranteed money this year.  Dragic may not have the accolades of CP or Kyle but he’s good and could get a decent contract exceeding MLE. Like he could get 3x$16m no problem."
"I'm generally side with the left, but Kyle Rittenhouse was defending himself and your argument is such a strawman. He didn't shoot the first guy until he was cornered, he tried to run. He didn't shoot the next two until he went down and one hit him with a skateboard and one drew on him. The 4th guy who backed off didn't get shot.  If you're an idiot who tries to attack someone with a guy who is not actively threatening you, blame Darwinism, not the gun."
Kyle Guy ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Basically anyone who was 7’3 and above. Mainly because they didn’t need to.   Also, Dirk, Larry Bird, Paul Pierce, Kyle Korver, Drazen Petrovic, basically most of the white guy shooters (except for Klay)."
"I can't even tell if you're joking anymore. Nobody who answered that question in 2013 would randomly select 0 time all star, 0 achievements, role player Kyle Lowry as a guy who would be successful in the 90s. No one would pick a high school Jahlil Okafor in 2013 who at that point hasn't even proven he's successful in college, let alone the modern NBA, to be successful in the 90s NBA. It's ok to admit you are wrong. We're all wrong sometimes."
Okafor is just an example my guy. And Kyle Lowry made 6 straight all star games. I don't give a shit if it was in 2013 or not. There were plenty of players who would have been fantastic in the 90s and it's stupid to say there were not. It's not like the league has suddenly improved with 90s level play. It's done the opposite. As if it's not obvious Demarcus Cousins would have been dominant in the 90s. Or KD would have been anything but spectacular. Or like Curry woudln't have been an incredible shooter in the 90s when players so much his lesser were awesome.     Some of the guards like Harden would have had issues and been totally different players but yea like Dwight Howard. Z-Bo and Big Al Jefferson wouldn't have flat out been better in a league built around their specific skill sets. MJ can GTFO with that foolishness. It's just a stupid ignorant statement made specifically to get attention.
"Masai Ujiri doesn’t give an eff about Toronto, traded city favourite derozan, homegrown valenciunas and Poetl to win one chip and claim his legacy…Toronto fans would’ve loved him even more if he’d been patient, kept the team together and let pascal/oG/Fred/norm develop with Demar and Kyle and serge and JV and Jakub…oh shit that’s a potential juggernaut for years to come, perfect team, would compete for championships for years, a lot of drafted talent, the city would adore them   Instead you get a one off chip lead by a guy who didn’t love the city and peace’s with barely a goodbye, a chip where the finals mvp won’t have his number retired, I’d almost call it meaningless and lightly embarrassing for the city   Eff Masai, he doin’ the tdot dirtier than VC"
"KAT, Edwards, DLo, Beasley and McDaniels has the makings of a pretty darn good starting lineup, especially if Edwards really did grow to 6’6” and McDaniels puts on weight. Ant is gonna have a heck of a lot of space to drive with that many shooters around him.   My biggest worry with the Timberwolves is their depth. Naz Reid and Patrick Beverly are pretty decent bench guys, but they really need a second creator off the bench. It would be huge if the Wolves could trade for a guy like Kyle Anderson, who can create offense and fill in multiple positions in the starting lineup.   The Timberwolves lack of depth is a big reason why injuries have hit them so hard."
"probably an unpopular opinion, but I think 2011 Rose was near his peak, that's not a bad thing, his MVP season was great, but a hyper athletic guard that isn't a great shooter is going to peak earlier than say a Kyle Lowry or Steve Nash type.   Sure there is still room for improvement, better decision making, better defensive reads, and efficiency are all typically things that come with age, but I don't think he would have gotten a whole lot better than his MVP season. Compared to a guy like Grant Hill who looked like the next best player in the league and was continually improving up until his injuries."
i used to take care of kyle korver at a restaurant i worked at in college. super nice guy and was also very spendy and generous. wouldn't even know he was famous by the way he acted.
Yup for a brief second after Ray Allen retired but before Kyle was physically broken down he was the best catch &amp; shoot guy in the league. Only guy with a real argument over him was Klay.
Reggie was bananas from deep in the Utah series but I wouldn't call him a floor spacing PG because I think that moniker fits a lot more of the George Hill/Kyle Lowry types than Reggie or Wall. Guards in our scheme are a lot more focused on drive-and-kick ability and require a certain level of athleticism because we have so much size that can shoot and we use Zubac in high PnR a fair bit.  I wouldn't hate Wall in a Clipper jersey for that reason. I think his floor is higher than Reggie's and I think you can afford to have 1 guy who isn't a deep threat if they bring other things to your offense. Maybe next offseason if he gets bought out we give him a look.
"Tbe best thing Kyle Kuzma has done was to literally, physically push Lebron in the back to play defense. I love Lebron, but man, that was inspiring stuff you want to see in a young guy. At the time I was like “who the fuck is Kyle Kuzma?” Haven’t really been super impressed with his fame since."
"Depends on what exactly you'd define as a second option. For instance, Pascal Siakam was the second scoring option for the Raps in 2019 but Kyle Lowry clearly had a bigger impact on the game than him. I think CJ can be a guy that can get the team buckets but you're going to run into issues if he's the team's second most important player."
Lebron is a great guy. Of course he says that. As a player you would have to be a dick to say otherwise.  I don't see Masai doing it. He knows (like everyone else by now) what drove the Raptors success in the teens was his drafting/players development and Kyle Lowry. And based on how high he sets the bar for the organization it would be a direct contradiction to reture Demar's jersey. Harsh but true.
"He’s also never made any bad moves except the reach on Bruno and signing Demarre Carol, who he had to use a first to dump.   -	Traded Grevis Vazquez who was out of the league two years later for picks that became OG (guy is seen as potential all-star) and Norm, who later became Gary Trent Jr.  -	Signed Kyle and Demar to contracts when at the time no one wanted to re-sign with Toronto. -	Traded for Gasol who was super important in the championship. -	People forget, but got Danny Green basically for free in the Demar trade, who was our starting two. -	Got FVV who went undrafted, and is now one of the better guards in the league. -	Didn’t budge with OKC on the Serge trade that was originally reported to be JV + Ross + 2 firsts, got him a year later for just Ross + bad first.  I could go on but it’s not like he just traded for Kawhi and the rest of career on Toronto sucked."
"Cade has had some nasty posters, windmills and through the leg dunks in his career. Dude euro-stepped into a poster in the FIBA U19 finals.   His game isn’t predicated on athleticism, he’s more methodical; controlling the pace and playing at his own speed. This narrative that he’s Kyle Anderson or as athletic as Middleton is pretty tired though. Guy went #1 for a reason"
"I understand what arguable means. My point is that Dragic has no argument for being better than Jimmy. He got a large contract because Pat Riley spends money like it’s going out of style. Just look at the contracts he gave to Hassan Whiteside and Tyler Johnson instead of Wade, or paying a washed Iguodala $15 million a year.   Being a team leader or the most important guy in the team doesn’t always mean that the guy is the best player on his team, or even that he has an argument for it. Case in point, Kyle Lowry was unquestionably the leader of the 2019 Raptors, and he was probably our most important player (at least on the offensive end) as well. But despite that, he had literally zero argument for being the best player on the team, because Kawhi clearly was that guy. It’s the same thing with Dragic and Jimmy."
No idea who this guy is. But Toronto has the recent history of developing their players. So you have that going for you.  I was a huge Kyle Anderson fan. Another dude where his IQ and instincts were by far the best assests of his game. When San Antonio drafted him I felt vindicated
Kyle Anderson for sure. Think of how much skill you need to have to play in the NBA with the athletic profile of a guy at the YMCA rocking air monarchs
I kinda like that Kyle Lowry guy
"The main issue I saw with the Warriors that I would like to see some way of addressed (either by progress from Poole or Lee stepping up for example) is they only have 1 late shot clock guy: steph. There's reasons why Dame and CJ don't work, but theyre always a passably efficient offense in the playoffs because they have 2 late shot clock guys. The Bucks have Middleton and then Jrue and Giannis have the ability to switch off as the second late shot clock dump off, the Nets have their 3, the Lakers ideally have 2 but I think they think they have 3, the Jazz have Conley and Mitchell, the Heat now have Jimmy and Kyle Lowry. Now some of these squads have other flaws that pull them back but the presence of 2 volume ball handlers and decisive late shot clock guys gives your offense a certain floor because you have a certain quality of shot you find every time down, even against correct defenses.  In a playoff series, because the game will inevitably slow down, at some point you're going to be in the half court more than Golden State wants to be, and we've seen Steph get absolutely murdered off ball because by any means Steph can't be allowed space late in the shot clock. In '16 you saw some of this become a problem, they still pulled out wins with a hobbled Steph but even when Draymond was a more capable scorer it became difficult to generate consistent looks in the half court because everything *had to be on time* for Golden State, and against a certain level of defense you're just going to run late some times. That's why KD was so lethal in Golden State was because with 7-9 seconds on the shot clock you could just get him the ball wherever, as far as 32 feet back if you had to, and he could get in his bag and get you a bucket."
"Walton's biggest argument over Dikembe is that in his peak, he was just a much better player. Walton did average 18/13/5 like you said, but his impact spoke much higher than his stats, the Blazers were an all-time great team with him and a below .500 squad without him.  Dikembe played a very long time, but he was always just a pretty decent center, at no point in his entire career he was a Top 3 center in the league, let alone achieve the heights that a guy like Walton did.  I get that longevity matters, but to me it has become the most overrated aspect of basketball. I rather have 10 years of an MVP candidate (Doncic, for example) than 20 years of a fringe All-NBA guy (Kyle Lowry)."
"The guy with the white t and Canadian accent is Kyle the founder of Nelk. The guy to his side the skinny light skin dude is Salim who’s a new-ish member and one of the replacements for the OG Nelk boys who left.  They used to make really funny situational prank + vlog style videos that were genuinely really good back when the members were Kyle, Jesse, Lucas, 905 but then at some point they went to LA or something and the video content completely changed and their personas went from geeky, goofy, edgy but likeable guys to now being sort of frat house overly macho kingpins or something idk it’s weird."
I saw someone post that Kyle Lowry could guard Shaq because he would just take charges. As if Shaq was just some big guy who had no skill or finesse.
"Okay, but that doesn’t sound like a 3 and D anymore. Otherwise you can say Kyle korver is a 3 and D guy.  He was a great team defender, he knew where to be and where others would go"
"Listen to this guy, hes a personal friend of Kyle Lowry"
" I'll list all the guys that I think are really really underrated (of course not the same level of players) :  DeAndre Hunter : A lot of people think he's just a 3&amp;D, but he's shown some mid range stuff that could translate into low all star type of shot creation already  PJ Dozier : I think he's a high end back up, good defender, good ballhandler, good positional versatility, athletic  Eric Gordon (crazy overpaid tho) : still a guy that can switch well, was very solid defensively in the playoffs every year, can shoot, spot up from deep, can shot create a bit still  Kyle Anderson : his shot is crazy slow and he's unathletic, but other than that he basically is decent or good at everything  Richaun Holmes : the Kings were good with him on the court last year, and were basically the worst defense of all time without him  Derrick White : has shown some impressive shot creation in the bubble, think he's underutilized because he shared the floor with 2 guys who can't shoot and therefore had to take a backseat when he came back from injury"
"Miami.  They got the best player in FA in Kyle Lowry. But he's 35, and he didn't have a great year last year. Butler just signed a huge extension and he doesn't shoot 3s, and you have to imagine he's going to start declining soon. They don't really have great assets outside of Bam, and he's on a max, so I'm not sure how they get better. And even after making all of these moves, their ceiling is still lower than Bucks/Lakers/Nets. If Lowry keeps declining, Butler doesn't play like a max guy, then this team could look quite hopeless quite quickly. But they could look great. But there is the feeling of doom about them.  I think this upcoming year may be their only shot and even then I'd still have brooklyn/lakers/bucks over them."
"Not really. Lebron averaged 34 pts during the 2018 series. The next guy in Kevin Love averaged 20 pts. His regular season average was 17 pts. The next guy was Kyle Korver who averaged 14 pts. He averaged 9 pts during the regular season. The next guy was J.R Smith who averaged 12 pts in the series. He averaged 8 pts. Having a 4-5 pt jump from your season avg doesn't really scream ""game of life"" and really undersells how dominate LeBron was during that series. He definitely did most of it by himself"
"The actual odds actually probably have less 0s than that, but your brain might not be developed enough to understand scale of numbers.  Even when you factor in the Tucker rule, assuming you need at least 0.3s on the clock for each of 2 necessary valid 3pt attempts 1.5s gives you plenty of time to make it possible.   0s turnovers are absolutely possible on inbound plays, which are guaranteed to happen here in any scenario where you assume you make the first of the required 2 3pt attempts.   The only factor that really runs time off the clock is the flight time of the ball in the air so it really comes down to whether or not you can inbound the ball at half court and make a 3pt attempt, and have the ball through the cylinder in less than 1.2 seconds - leaving time on the clock for one more valid 3pt attempt, which you're attempting to draw a foul over a screen on, make the FT for 7pts to send the game to OT.  If I had to pick any NBA player to take this shot on paper, it's probably Kyle Guy. Not because he's a great 3pt shooter, but he has a super quick release and the flattest arc I've ever seen so the ball has as little flight time as possible.  You continue to act like you have anything that backs up your argument of ""nuh uh, its impossible"" like a small child."
i think Giddey can be a guy who makes a couple all star games and flirts with a few all-nba teams. i kind of see him as a kyle lowry on the raptors type of player in that he functions as the engine of the team. he knows how to get people shots and makes the right read. this type of impact isn't always really quantified in stats but makes him invaluable to any team.  i hope that kinda makes sense. it's also just my projection/guess as to what's gonna happen lol
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
"Elleby is a solid glue guy, no star potential but he's a half IQ double the energy Kyle Anderson. A bit of fine tuning he is a nice gap filler."
"&gt; We've never seen Klay lead his own team.  Exactly he has never done it, which is something against him, the same thing happens with someone lile Ginobili. That's not something that helps his case.  &gt; All those stats tell me is the media thought way higher of Pippen than Klay.  Yeah because Pippen was better.  &gt; Klay isn't in the same discussion as a Derozan or a Kyle Lowry or whoever else is getting picked for All-NBA.   IMO he is, maybe you are underrating Lowry.   &gt; The media is just dumb, and using them as your guidelines is embarassing.  Maybe you are just bias with your guy.  &gt; Klay was a huge reason his team went to the finals 5 straight years. Y'all may not understand how incredible he is yet, but once this group is retired you'll realize how good they are.  We understand how huge he was, that doesn't make him a player on the same level as Pippen.  You don't like voting base reasons? How about advanced stats then? Pippen vs Klay:  * Career VORP: 63.2 vs 14.2 * Career WS: 125.1 vs 46.8 * Playoffs VORP: 14.2 vs 3.1 * Playoffs WS: 23.6 vs 8.7  ""But those are cumulative why Klay's career has been shorter"" Let's use minute adjusted advanced stats then:  * Career BPM: 4.1 vs 0.7 * Career WS/48: .146 vs .110 * Career PER: 18.6 vs 16.4 * Playoffs BPM: 4.9 vs 0.7 * Playoffs WS/48: .140 vs .091 * Playoffs PER: 18.4 vs 14.1  Pippen has a higher net rating in the regular season and playoffs."
Kyle Guy
"We remember.   We also remember that somebody else was on that team. LeBron something something ... maybe you've heard of him?  If winning one title as the second-best player on the team is enough, then where's Kyle Lowry? Where's Klay Thompson? Where's Manu Ginobilli? Where's Kyrie? Joe Dumars?   The list - aside from halos around the '80s Lakers, '80s Celtics, and '90s Bulls - clearly puts more stock in being the #1 guy on a not-great team than it does in putting the #2 guy on a title winner.   You value what AD did more than, say, Pete Maravich? Totally. But by that metric, AD isn't a particularly egregious snub - there are several players in line ahead of him who have better accomplishments than ONE run as the second-best player on a title team.   The Clyde Drexler comparison is interesting, and gets to the challenge. We know what AD can do as the #1 guy on his team ... and it's not as good as what Clyde did. But if Clyde had been teammates with Jordan, rather than rivals (and that almost happened! Portland brass wanted to draft Jordan and were overruled by the owner, according to the rumors) Clyde would have won multiple titles."
Who cares about a ring. Kyle Kuzma has a ring.  The guy is on the 75 players team.
Memphis grizzlies in the playins. Morant trying to baptize gobert and Kyle guy being stuck in slow motion
"Generally agree; admittedly to say he is ""peak"" for his build of course is hyperbole, but I hoped the message coming across would have been -- he's as good as anyone else with his general build. And that being said, I don't think the players you made for comparison are analogous. Like I said, they're known for specific physical traits that Curry never had, doesn't have, and probably never will have.  For the analogous examples you might have been interested in seeing, well it's guys like:  - Kyrie - Dame - Tony Parker - Steve Nash - Monta Ellis  These are people with similar builds in recent memory whose tenure in the league was based on everything but defense. This doesn't get into all the players that are out of the league or didn't make it. I believe it is fair to say that no one would compare Kyle Lowry or Fred Vanvleed in physical build / athleticism to any of these guys, including Curry.  You can imagine why I didn't just sit here and list them out because that sounds more cherry-picking than anything else.  And overall, I think we're guilty of the same thing. Yeah I don't have any data to show how weak Curry is. I don't have data to show how incomparable his build is to Lowry or FVV. Ultimately it comes down to the eye test -- and I would never group those 3 players together as having the same or similar builds. I use height-weight-wingspan-vertical as a proxy because that information is accessible. Likewise, I suspect you used general size / wingspan as well to source that list (otherwise it would perplex me as to why Thicc Boi Lowry was even brought up).  The one guy that I think fits as a valid counterexample is John Stockton, whose height, weight general strength / push-around-ness on the court mirrors Curry's, yet he made multiple all-defensive teams. He's the only guy I can think of, and even on reviewing a list of similar-sized guards with those parameters above, he's the only guy that stands out. Everyone else was a freak athlete in some other way."
Kyle does seem like the type of guy to go 20% above and beyond for a friend.
"the one thing I will give Dame which Dwight doesn't get discounted for..Dame has been playing in a guard heavy era. During Dame's career he's had to compete with Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall (when he was good), Isaiah Thomas (when he was good), Chris Paul, Kyrie, Kyle Lowry, I mean this era has been one of the most stacked guard eras in a while.   Meanwhile Dwight was making first team as a Center in an era where Shaq in PHX was 3rd team, Andrew Bogut who never made an All Star game is 3rd team, Tyson Chandler who's never made an All Star team was 3rd team. Usually the second best Center was Amare Stoudemire who's more of a Power Forward really, so yeah Dwight was making first team as literally the only TRULY dominant center during his era. Dame is out here missing First Team All NBA because he's behind Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, aka guys that are all on the top 75. Dwight Howard never had to beat a top 75 guy to make All NBA. Dame could very well get 1st team the next 3-4 years now that CP3 has cooled off, Westbrook has cooled off, Curry is still hot but maybe Dame has as good of year."
"MIAMI — For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry’s face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      “I knew I was good,” Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. “I knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.”      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee’s tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      “We all were mutually agreed that it was time,” Lowry said of leaving Toronto. “It’s hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      His journey in Toronto started with questions — he was the team’s backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash — crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      “The city of Tampa was great,” Lowry said. “It was just difficult because we didn’t know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.”      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team’s dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team’s president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      “Sometimes franchises have to do what’s best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn’t say power — but I had a little bit of, ‘Listen, it’s not going to be a good look if we don’t collaborate on this together,’” Lowry said. “We all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      “With DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.”      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. “It’s been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,” Ujiri said at a news conference in August. “We knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.”      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      “I’ve never been super athletic,” Lowry said with a laugh. “I can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I’m not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don’t need to be jumping.”      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry’s sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry’s primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan — “Smooth,” Lowry said of DeRozan. “That’s my best friend.”      And of Leonard: “A machine,” Lowry said. “He gets it done.”      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game’s quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      “I partly think it’s to get him going, because he’s got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,” Lowry said, adding that “some people can’t take it” and think Butler’s a jerk.      “Nah, it’s just how he is,” Lowry said. “Everybody has different demands on themselves.”      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      “He’s always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,” Butler said. “It’s incredible. It’s a blessing, and sometimes it’s a curse because you’ve got to be in some really great shape if you’re out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.”      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      “Freddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I’m the guy who was like, ‘Yo, it’s on me,’” he said, adding: “They have to take the criticism, and that’s what’s going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.”"
"I replied to another guys comment, which I can do because I'm not the idiot who said ""You want to know what I do when I see a comment I don’t like about my team or players, I keep scrolling...you know the thing you couldn’t do without getting sucked into this stupid back and forth"" as they go and reply to a comment they don't like about a different team. Practice what you preach, if you don't like a comment continue scrolling, like I did with the rookie Tatum spam, Caruso spam, THT spam, etc which have been more egregious than any Barnes posting. Keep that same energy with all the big fanbases my guy.  You are attacking flairs. ""every time the guy dribbles a basketball you Raptors fans try to validate your pick"". ""Raptors fans as a whole"", you take the lowest common denominator dumb fucks and brush anyone with a Raptors flair with it (attacking a flair), so let me ak you a question. Do you think Lakers fans as a whole were sucking THT and Carusos dick like every basic play they made was next level, or do you think that was the lowest common denominator idiots who did so? You are doing the whole Anti-Raptors circlejerk to counter the Raptors circlejerk (which I actually dislike outside of memes like comparing every NBA rookie to Flynn or Kyle Lowry aint a spot up shooter), which makes yall just two sides of the same circlejerking coin.   Pointing out that as a Celtics fan they have no ground to stand on is also a perfectly valid and reasonable point. Then you came in triggered af with your panties in a bunch like the snowflake you are. And your point wasn't ""Raptor fans are sucking their role players dicks"", you were bitching about there being too many Scottie Barnes posts like he isn't the 4th overall pick and only had one singular post today which was his first NBA basket. Thinking you're a dumb fuck isn't the same as having your panties in a bunch, being a snowflake or triggered. You are clearly triggered, a snowflake and got your panties in a bunch over seeing posts of the 4th overall pick. Get over yourself."
"Love Kayte, but Kyle just doesn't have a great broadcasting voice. Plus, they're having to call the games from a remote broadcast booth which amplifies the lack of boom. He does have good enthusiasm, but IIRC he was an east coast guy for his whole life until last year.  Kayte and Mark Jones are awesome together, though. Here's hoping Kyle turns the corner."
"I will always miss Kyle, but I am also super excited to see Fred lead this team as the locker room guy. He's got it, he knows what we're about."
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
"I remember Kyle Lowry doing this a lot for the Raptors. One play in particular he knew involved throwing a cross court inbounds pass to a wing, so Lowry covered the wing. The pass was high so the guy jumped but Kyle knew it was for him so he just waited on the floor and when the guy came down with the ball it was practically in Kyle’s hands and he took off with it"
"You mean the guy that had a generational talent that they had built a team around quit playing, forced a trade, and tanked his trade value somehow missed a few playoffs afterward? Lets ignore that while Kawhi was nursing his injury, Pop still somehow got a terrible line-up to the playoffs that year, and then the next two years competed until the very last week of the season to fight for a playoff spot.   Seriously, look at the line-up he managed to get into the 2018 playoffs (2nd yr Dejounte Murray/washed up Tony Parker who avg 7ppg, Danny Green, washed up Gasol, Kyle Anderson, and Aldridge). Name me one other coach in the league you think could take that starting lineup to the playoffs."
"Ya I mean I like Westbrook as much as the next guy but there’s still questions on how they will all fit together especially come playoff time. While Kyle Lowry + AD and Lebron would basically guarantee another championship, much better fit"
"I know it depended on whether or not he wanted to go to Dallas, but I felt like Kyle Lowry was the perfect fit for the Mavs especially since they are in win-now mode in the next few years, so 25-30m x 3 years really isn't that ridiculous considering he is a fairly durable guy.  He can play as the 2 alongside Luka to ease pressure off of him or run the second unit as a bench guy.  He doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective.  Unselfish and a responsible two-way player."
"Billups has a claim for ""best guy on a championship team"" status (or at the very least, he won finals MVP). Kyrie does not. Not only that but he's never really accomplished anything in the playoffs without LeBron, whereas Chauncey clearly led or co-led multiple deep playoff runs.  Khris Middleton, Kyle Lowry, and Tyson Chandler were all the second best guy on a championship team. Doesn't mean much when the best guy is an all-time great."
He's not super relevant but Kyle Guy has a pretty quick release
Lmfao how the guy above u really say kyle lowry over nash
"Lowry can score if you need him to and he is a very decent 3 point shooter. He also will make Bam a better scorer. And don't be surprised if you see a jump in Herro's play as well. If you have some young guys that need a push to the next level, Kyle is your guy."
"I just find it funny that's all man, it's really not too deep. Of course I'm going to laugh at division rivals misfortune. It would be the same of Lowry Walked for nothing, ppl would be clowning Masai.  On your point, that's what Lowry says, who knows if this the truth. I really doubt a guy competitive as Lowry was perfectly ok staying in Tampa with a garbage team when there were 3 playoff teams interested. Also if Kyle said yea I'm staying, I really doubt Masai is asking for trade proposals still. That would be a big PR hit regardless what he got back. It's different then DeMar since Lowry literally helped bring the only legitimate championship Toronto has had in over 2 decades"
Buckle up old Kyle is going to take you for a ride my guy what a ride it is.
"A lot of Raptors fans tried telling people this and the fanbases of the teams that did pass on him were entirely full of shit about it. Saying that it wouldn't have made a difference, that Raptors fans were acting like homers, completely ignoring that Kyle Lowry was the #1 playmaker on a championship roster that had one of the toughest paths to the ring (aside from the finals) just two years ago.  The guy is an absolute game-changer and has skills that don't age. In the same season that Chris Paul took the Suns from bums to contenders, people were doubting Kyle Lowry's impact on elevating a team when he's almost the same player.  People are going to see this year what the Sixers missed out on last year. Every time he makes a disgusting needle hole pass, every time he takes a clutch late-game charge, everytime he bodies a guy twice his size while fighting for the ball, people are gonna see it."
Kyle is his guy. They were bound to pair up.
"Yeah watching him in the playoffs last year it seemed like he actually might be better offensively than a lot of the ""Kyle Korver"" type of players, he was actually hitting 3s off the dribble as well   But you are right that he doesn't shoot all that much for a guy who shoots 45% from three"
&gt; why is Kyle Kuzma taking 8 threes  this is the funniest thing i’ve ever read. this guy is in for a season.
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"Raps don't win with CJ for FVV or Norm. They already had three capable scorers in Kawhi, Kyle, and Pascal, they didn't need another 20+ pt guy. Both FVV and Norm had big games offensively but their biggest value was defense. FVV is underrated on D now that the Raps aren't good, and while Norm isn't on FVV's level, he's a very capable defender who can hold his own in a lot of matchups."
Don't you put that evil on Kyle Guy!
"right. Kyle Guy (Sacramento) ""I'm not taking that vaxx, fuck that. you guys are crazy""   Kyle Guy (Free Agent/Waived) ""Why they dont want me?"" 🤔😥"
"He’s soooooo slow. I still can’t get over why people have this guy so high. It’s like if you took KD’s skill body type(Holmgren looks even lankier), but then gave him Kyle Anderson’s speed and agility.  Banchero looks like the top player from that draft class."
Everyone except Kyle Guy. Makes sense why he’s no longer a King.
Kyle Guy
"He was pretty one note before though, his game elevated a lot last year. He was a bench scorer and just that. It’s easy to say in hindsight he was a steal but honestly he was just a role player, Kyle korver style guy."
Kyle Kuzma must be to young to remember Emmitt Smith's short stint of being a talking head. Emmitt Smith was paid millions of dollars to be an NFL media guy.  Here is my evidence that debunks Kyle Kuzma. [https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1222](https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1222)
"When Tjarks was on, I thought it was great. J Kyle Mann is also really good on his own as he does great Ringer videos too. But the new guy Wos just ruined it all and I can't listen to anything he pops up on."
"Man speaking of Mannion, when I saw Seth have some success I thought the league would trend towards shooting being a premium (even if it’s not a guy of great stature) and that guys recently drafted such as Tyrell Terry, Mannion, and Kyle Guy would have productive NBA careers (albeit maybe not right away).  Looking back on that now is funny, Terry a FA, I think Nico is overseas, and Guy is in the G League. Looks like they all gonna have to get it out the mud Seth Curry style if they wanna make it."
"i mean KP has been more willing to play inside the last stretch of games but look what happened last night, he goes limping off 3 minutes into the 2nd half.     he clearly doesn't look comfortable there and is justifiably worried about reinjuring his lower body.   and he doesn't have the best core strength you can jam him up on screens and walk around him.  I'm glad he got the memo that he's 7'4 and needs to get more rebounds though I'm still not sold on him boxing anyone out, against the heat he was getting boxed out by kyle lowry of all people lol.   respect to kyle lowry of course he's quite thicc but come on KP you are a foot taller than him letting yourself get muscled around by this guy  I'll give ya kleber would be a nice bench piece on some teams, I like his game a lot.    maybe bullock is good but he seems like he's been public enemy #1 among mavs fans for the last week, if he's not scoring points then he's probably contributing to losing basketball  I thought powell looked alright guarding small forwards but he just gets carved up trying to play center.  I was trying to be generous to him I don't think he would be in most teams' rotations"
"Until now, I would probably have agreed with you. The thing is that Kanter changing his name makes everything else he is doing and saying seem weird. If Kyle Kuzma had changed his name to Kyle Kuzma Freedom, the reaction would be ""Eh, whatever"". But because Enes Kanter have decided to use his platform to critique the people holding power, rightly in most cases, his critique will now be coming from someone who changed his name to ""Freedom"". And that discredits everything else he's saying, because can we really trust what a guy who changed his name to ""Freedom""?"
"Kyle Lowry was basically like  ""I still love you, you're my true love but I need to go spread my wild seeds while I still can...I'll be back in a few seasons baby ""       I wouldn't be surprised at all if Lowry ended re signing on the cheap with the Toronto and coming off the bench at like 38 years old...by then they will be a monster and ready to win another chip so the timelines would work...plus the still city love the guy!"
Kyle Guy?
"Yeah this is how it felt. We finally went all the way and then our FMVP still didn't want to re-sign to stay on. For Rap fans it was just a moment of ""wtf what do we have to do to hold a free agent?! A ring and FMVP isn't enough?!"" We didn't resent Kawhi, but damn, that didn't mean it didn't sting.     The entire city (never mind the team, literally the whole city of Toronto) would have gone out of their way to make his life as comfortable as possible. Ironically, the intense media attention on someone so private off the court probably rated as a negative for him.     In my mind, the three most memorable moments from that title run were:   1./ 4 bounces.   2./ Kyle *popping off* in Q1 of G6 in the finals.   3./ [The housewarming gift.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_XpsVujmp4) This guy right here was all of us, down to the last man, woman, and child. Absolute legend.  (Honourable mention to FVV becoming FVV Sr. and dad-dicking the Bucks)."
"Kyle Lowry is not a star rn. He’s a very solid starter as of right now, and this isn’t me shitting on him the guy is 35 years old."
"To your point, I was at a game the other day and someone in 2nd row was heckling Kyle Lowry (dunno what was said). Lowry looks directly at him and says ""shut the fuck up bitch ass mother fucker"" then the guy gets this incredulous look on his face like he got Lowry. When the ref next to Lowry did nothing the fan said some more shit and Lowry started pointing to the court and said ""come make me bitch.""  These dudes hear so much trash talk, but don't usually have people removed so I have to assume it was a pretty unpleasant thing said to LeBron."
man kyle looooooooves sga   makes sense bc he’s a kentucky guy but this is like the third or 4th video where sga is heavily featured by him  really good video though
Someone asked a different guy to protect their store and that different guy asked Kyle to help
"It was Cwebb, now I’d say maybe Billups.  STAT was an mvp caliber guy in NY one year and was great for Phoenix.  Tyson Chandler might have a HOF case, Joakim Noah might not make the hall but he was a really great player.  Luol Deng too.  Jermaine O’Neal sticks out as a snub.  Throwback Andrew Toney the Boston strangler.  Joe Johnson was one of my all time favs hope he makes the Hall at some point.  Mark Aguirre bad boy Piston is not in the hall despite an awesome college career and really really good nba career  Andre Miller also one of those guys for even how remarkable his career was has no shot at the HOF but deserves to be remembered by fans  At the time in the mid 00’s I think most people would’ve assumed that Rasheed Wallace would make the hall before Ben Wallace but that did not happen  Human highlight reel Shawn Kemp is not in  Just some names that don’t belong in the Hall but deserve a shout out, Derek Fisher, Gerald Wallace, Shane Battier, Kyle Korver, Marcus Camby, Danny Granger, David West, Andrei Kirlienko, Mehmet Okur, Nikola Pekovic, Josh Smith, Gerald Green.  I fricking love the nba so much"
You’re not quite in the right headspace   Russell Westbrook would be a demon skill position guy. I could also see Kyle Lowry or Chris Paul being a 5-7x pro bowl safety.
Kyle Lowry. The man is a walking definition of leadership and hard work. Such a lovable personality plus you can't help falling for him after he started taking charges...at an all star game!!  The guy makes everyone better and loves when they get a bag. Plus being super dependable.
"&gt;	How do you tell the difference between a bad guy with a gun and a good guy with a gun? Wait until people get shot?  Yes.  &gt;	How do you expect people not to react to that in that environment?  By having the composure to not attack someone unless you are attacked. Kyle, the other militia ding-dongs, and the majority of the protesters had that composure. The 3 dudes who got shot did not. If you can’t handle being in a high pressure environment like that without attacking others unprovoked, don’t go."
"&gt;	Nobody would have died in Kenosha that night if Kyle Rittenhouse stayed home. It was his incessant need to antagonize the situation that led to him having to “defend himself”.  Completely disagree. There have been plenty of instances of violence at protests in the last 18 months. The first dude who attacked him who he shot and killed was someone was: a bipolar convicted-pedophile who had been released from the hospital *hours before the protests* after he had had mental break down in which he tried to kill himself for the second time. He’s on film in the crowd of protestors walking down armed counter protestors screaming “Shoot me n***a!”. He attacked Kyle after Kyle apparently attempted to put out a fire the guy had started.  You really think that the only reason violence occurred is because Kyle showed up with a gun, when there’s individuals as unstable as that dude walking around? Please.  It’s not an escalation to carry a firearm. It is an escalation to riot and burn things, to walk people down, to chase and assault someone, to beat someone over the head with a skateboard, or to rush someone on the ground and point a handgun at them. Between Kyle and the 3 people he shot, he’s the only one who did none of those things."
"&gt; Doesn't bringing a gun usually escalate things when things go sour?   What happens if things go sour and now he's taking a beating from 3 guys and has no way to effectively defend himself?  You're assuming he brought the gun to deliberately escalate things, rather than bringing the gun in case things go sour.  &gt; If Kyle didn't bring his gun and he got into a fight, everyone would go home that night.  True, and if he didn't go at all, everyone would go home that night.  Or, if the first guy wasn't there that night, everyone would go home that night.  Or if he didn't try to take Rittenhouse's gun from him, everyone would go home that night.  If the second guy didn't try to smash him in the head with a skateboard, everyone would go home that night.  If the last guy didn't point a gun at him, no one would get their arm blown off.  If people weren't rioting that night, everyone woulda been at home that night.  There's a lot of hypothetical situations we can sit here and spout off about, but the fact of the matter is, no one involved did anything right, but that doesn't mean Rittenhouse broke any laws."
"No, I don’t think that’s true. If Kyle really was the “bad guy with a gun” who provoked the situation in the first place, then he has no right to self-defense. You can’t claim self-defense when you were the one who acted as the aggressor in the first place."
"I think it's pretty normal to feel at least a bit on edge around guns. Regardless of if open carry is legal or not, if I saw someone walking down the street with a military grade weapon like an AR15, I'd be nervous. Even if that person was just minding their own business and acting in a completely non-threating manner, the existence of a loaded assault rifle near my person adds justifiable tension. Words and actions that otherwise wouldn't be that big of an issue suddenly can feel like a serious threat all because someone is carrying a gun. That is because guns are tools designed for a single purpose, to kill whatever thing they are pointed at. Making the decision to carry a gun is basically saying that you are willing to use it to potentially kill someone. I'm not even trying to specifically call out Kyle, the general unrest and other people in the area with firearms also added to this environment.  Comparing that understandable fear of a dangerous weapon to rapists feeling entitle to a woman because of her revealing outfit is not the same at all. Outfits are not a threat, they are not designed for the specific purpose of harming another person. Women don't put on outfits to as open invitations for any guy to have sex with her. Comparing the two is absolutely awful."
"That first guy was deranged and looking for a fight. If it wasn't Kyle, it would have been someone else. If it was someone else, we would probably be talking about how Rosenbaum should be locked up for life for killing an unarmed person."
"&gt; It's not about the legality of him defending himself  OK, let's look at the legality.  &gt; it's the precedent of a child arming themselves,   He was not unlawfully armed.  &gt; travelling to a site of civil unrest,   He's allowed to travel wherever he wants, especially considering he worked and has family in Kenosha. There wouldn't have been any civil unrest if the government did its job to protect citizens and their property.  &gt; and putting themselves in a position to discharge a firearm in self defense and that being legally ok.  Yes, discharging a firearm in self defense is legally ok.  &gt; From what i've read about the first guy he killed, it's not disingenuous to say that if Kyle doesnt have a firearm that entire encounter likely doesn't occur. (and, obviously, if he's not even fucking there it doesn't occur either)  If Rosenbaum didn't threaten to kill Kyle and then try to take his gun, the first shooting wouldn't have happened. (and, obviously, if Rosenbaum wasn't even fucking there it doesn't occur either)."
Wasn't he running facing the guy? Running backwards. How did he shoot him if his back was to him the entire time?   In fact if Kyle had indeed fully ran directly away at full speed and not stopped until he was a way from him fully..  there would have likely been  no shooting.
"Kyle was already de escalating by going to the police. He was getting away from the mob.  Rioters and looters are already armed, see bicep guy, and Kyle wasn’t counter protesting but defending something against a violent mob who was trying to destroy the community ."
"&gt; How do you tell the difference between a bad guy with a gun and a good guy with a gun?  I kinda want to hear an actual answer to this question. Kyle was indistinguishable to everyone there so do we always assume any active shooter, whether we find out later it's self defense or not, is a good guy with a gun? Because if so, there is no such thing as a ""bad guy with a gun"". And if not, to everyone there Kyle was a ""bad guy with a gun"" and they should have then shot him as one of the ""good guys with a gun"". But then of course anyone that didn't think Kyle was a ""bad guy with a gun"" would now assume his killer is a ""bad guy with a gun"" and has to shoot *him*. And... you can see where this is going."
"&gt;You can tell from the video and all the other evidence  We have the fbi drone video... no audio. It shows them stopping to talk second to talk and then he starts chasing him.   Depending on what kyle said... that could be starting the fight. If he said ""I'm gonna shoot you!"" Well... that feels a lot more like manslaughter.   The other videos are just after guy is chasing him for who knows why.   But of course as we don't have that audio..  and Kyle isn't likely to tell us if he did start it.  And the other guy is dead..  I guess here we are.   But it's much more of a lack of evidence than proof who started it for sure."
"All we have is the testimony of Rittenhouse and the boogaloo boi.  Sorry, but that's not credible to me.  So, all I have is the video showing the two of them running in the same direction, when Kyle decides to turn and execute the guy who was behind him.  You're absolutely right that police do act in the same fashion.  That's, you know, the entire problem?  Maybe it shows that the laws are fucky?  Rittenhouse, as an active shooter, shouldn't get to claim self defense.  Someone chasing down an active shooter certainly should be able to claim self defense when they try and de-arm the person or de-escalate the situation.  What we're going to get out of this is future protesters are going to be armed and ready.  You're going to see groups akin to the Black Panthers showing up to protect against the Rittenhouses of the world, and now we have more people ready to use guns at the drop of a pin on our streets and it sucks for everyone.  Grosskreutz would've been perfectly within his legal rights to just execute Kyle with his handgun instead of trying to approach him and de-escalate the situation.  That's a problem when the law starts giving everyone the right to kill each other.  You can be sure that nobody else is going to make the same mistake Grosskreutz made again."
All I have to say: the mom was arguably more responsible and I'd make it illegal to carry visibly in hand a deadly weapon in public. Like a guy walking around with a machete in his hand is just going to cause people to run away and think he's on a manhunt. It isn't responsible or sensical to actually have your deadly weapon in your hands in public unless you're being attacked.  The whole thing could have been prevented if Kyle just kept his rifle on his back and not in his hands when the loud noises in the background will make people think he's an active shooter. Every person who attacked Kyle attacked him because they thought he was an active shooter.
I mean the guy who lived basically admitted under oath that Kyle shot him in self defense lol
"&gt;I think the guy pulled the gun on Kyle thinking he was an active shooter and was trying to stop him and got shot.  Very hard to believe when he is on video talking to Kyle when he says ""I'm going to the police"".  He then starts chasing after him and pulls out his gun, even though Kyle isn't shooting anyone and is running towards the police line with his gun down."
"Lol if you paid attention to the court stream (breaking news: you didn't even watch more than 5 mins) you would realize why the video you're watching is bogus and why when the actual video that shows it at higher definition than 240p was shown to the jury ruled the reason they did. Again, it got to the point where the judge almost ruled a mistrial as the prosecution hid the fact that a high-def video existed. I wonder why the prosecution hid the high-def video..hmm... i wonder why the video you showed, being the low-definition one, makes it look like kyle just turned around and shot a guy for no reason."
"I don't understand how Walton thought these adjustments would save his job.  You had four dynamic guards in which you could have three of them in at any time. You had switchability on the perimeter and passable spacing even if all Harkless did was flit around the perimeter and miss too many open 3s. Hence Barnes could shoot 8 threes a game and thrive doing it and get downhill whenever he wanted. You even had a big body in Len that could help stem you physicality/rebounding problem.  Was it even particularly good? No, and the 4 game slide proves that. They're missing another forward. They choke too much. But if you kept at that, I could've easily seen him keeping his job. Their net rating was the best since '06.  Then he completely flips the switch and goes with full-sized lineups again. At ALL times. He doesn't even just start with a full-sized lineup, if Metu isn't in, Bagley is. He forces Barnes back to be a full-time goddamned 3, kills the spacing, clogs the paint, and kills the switchability on defense.  This is the guy who has played Kyle Kuzma and Harrison Barnes at C. He goes to this NOW?!  And all of this for the saviors of Chimezie Metu and Marvin Bagley. For their rebounding problem. When neither of them are good defensive rebounders.  Bottom line is they were a flawed team that was using its best attributes to its advantage.  May make some statement wins, may lose pretty badly. But ever since the OKC game, they've looked like a bottom 3 team.  He has to be smoking rock."
The guy who he gave money to buy it admitted he bought it with money given to him by Kyle for Kyle? The guy currently in jail on charges of illegally purchasing a weapon for a minor?
"Why do people keep stupidly using the vigilante argument.    Read up on what a vigilante is before making a bad take please.   Standing outside your neighborhood or around a business and open carrying, legally, is not vigilanteism.   A vigilante goes after someone they decide is a criminal and dispense their idea of justice. That is 100% not what happened.   Kyle didn’t go and shoot some guy he thought was a criminal or in an active crime.   He literally stood there, put out some fires, wrapped some ladies sprained ankle, was verbally attacked, spoke in a calm tone to deescalate (confirmed by servers witnesses in the trial), went out alone to go to another car source and was chased, he tried to flee and was cornered, shot the man chasing him after hearing another man shoot his pistol at him, runs away to the police, gets chased again, falls, gets kicked and bashed and a pistol aimed at his head and shoot only 2 of the large group of attackers and only the two that posed the biggest threat.   That’s not vigilantism. Your world view is totally fucked if you believe any of that was wrong to do or is being a “vigilante”"
Kyle was already pointing his gun. You think bicep guy knew Kyle wouldn’t shoot?
No. Kyle was literally leaving. Bicep guy quite literally said I would not have been shot had I not pointed my gun at him. That's under oath. And on video.  Owning a gun and / or carrying a gun is not intimidation. It's literally the law that it's acceptable behavior.
"Because Kyle threatened him with his gun first. If bicep guy shot first, surely it’d be out of self defense?"
"If he's firing at you, or pointing his gun at you you would have an argument.  He didn't, and was actively leaving the situation.  They lose their self defense claim when they pursue. In fact, the bicep guy (I can't spell his last name) testified under oath that he only got shot because he threatened Kyle with his gun first.  This is such a bad faith argument. You're acting like he's floating through crowds blasting people. He literally shot a guy who verbally threatened to murder him and started chasing him. Not only did Kyle try to leave to de-escalate, he told the 3rd guy shot (minutes before shooting him) that he was turning himself in."
"The first guy had a mental disorder and said he was going to kill Kyle if he ever got him alone.  The second and third guy only saw the outcome of that altercation and decided to act as vigilantes on bad information and also got the bad end of that stick. Had they known the facts, they wouldn't have engaged. Had they not engaged, they wouldn't be dead or seriously wounded."
"I know you're right, but it's also irrelevant here.  Unequal justice or unfair treatment of the PoC community doesn't mean Kyle should be convicted. He's still a fucking idiot, but he was actively defending himself.  Again, the first guy literally said ""I'll fucking kill you if I get you alone."" the second guy swung a skateboard at his head. The third guy said ""he only shot me when I pulled my gun on him."""
"Isn't the full context of that court convo that Kyle pointed his gun first at the guy, but didn't shoot. Then the guy drew on Kyle, but didn't shoot, then Kyle started blasting."
"Sure, a guy who's a Trump supporter, [flashes white power in a photo](https://www.cbs58.com/news/bond-agreement-for-kyle-rittenhouse-modified-after-he-was-seen-at-racine-co-bar), and has blue lives matter all over his social media is a BLM supporter.  A guy who literally went to a BLM place to kill people is a BLM supporter."
"Your examples are poorly chosen because in both cases these are the guys job so they have to be there. For the convenience store guy u don't even have to shoot tbh but I understand if you try. Cops are trained for these situations and we're supposed to trust their judgement but even then can make mistake at times.   Kyle did not need to be there , he willingly put himself in a situation where it could happen."
"The only reason he's being made a hero is because the media and certain groups of people first made him a villain.  There were dozens of videos showing what happened, there were witnesses, even one of the guys who got shot was like ""yeah he didn't shoot me until i pointed my gun at him"". If this had been in any other place or any other day but with the same facts (three people chasing an armed guy running away from them) it wouldn't even have gone to trial and if it did it wouldn't even have a jury and would've been dismissed immediatly.  But that didn't happen. People wanted a villain, so this story was concocted about a white supremacist going across america hauling an armament of illegal guns who opened fire on a defenseless crowd of black children. And so Kyle the white supremacist terrorist was born, and that rhetoric spread like fire across social media, news, conversations, nobody bothered to watch the videos or listen to the witnesses, NBC and Twitter told me Kyle shot three black people so its true. There you have it, a villain.  But then the trial starts, every video is shown in great detail, the witnesses are given a national audience, the prosecution is caught in lie upon lie, they contradict their own witnesses and evidence, they argue on theories and speculation. And Kyle the martyr and now Kyle the hero is born.  Kyle was and is an idiot. And he killed two people, families are destroyed, he'll spend his whole life afraid for his life or in therapy. He's not a hero, but i don't blame the people who made him a hero. I blame the people who made him a villain first."
"Honestly theres so many factors involved that its not just ones fault. I think the key factor that made this tragedy happen was the mentally ill guy that was chasing the kid and the guy that was right behind them that fired his own gun. adrenaline was running high from all the tension and thats all that it took. After that the hivemind mentality took over which is why the other two guys with skateboards charged toward rittenhouse, which could have really hurt the kid or once the kid was disarmed the hivemind mentality would set in and kyle could have been killed. That was a possible outcome and hence the self defense. Idk what kind of person that kid is but he seems like little shithead 17 year old that found himself knee deep in shit water. All those people involved should equally share the blame but it so just happens that kyle was the one that lived. I dont really know if you can hold one person accountable for the shitshow that happened that night in Kenosha. The fact is that there were peaceful protests and riots that destroyed many businesses(which are not the same) and people that felt they could protect businesses from the riots. It seems that all turmoil overwhelmed the police force on the scene so I guess the person in charge of that would ultimately be the person to blame. In anyway sorry if it appeared that I was trying to shift the blame away from the kid, that wasnt my intention, I was just trying to say that there were many factors to this situation and regardless of politics this was the right decision and not because I think rittenhouse was a noble kid trying to do the right thing."
"this is victim-blaming. he had just as much of right to be there as anyone else. he had a right to be armed to defend himself. he ended up needing to do just that.   Kyle was the good guy who cared about his community and the feral criminals who attacked him were the bad guys trying to destroy it. The second you finally accept that, it will all make sense."
"he had just as much of a right to be there as those violent rioters, if not more  Kyle was the good guy who cared about his community and the feral criminals who attacked him were the bad guys trying to destroy it. The second you finally accept that, it will all make sense."
"Kyle was the good guy who cared about his community and the feral criminals who attacked him were the bad guys trying to destroy it. The second you finally accept that, it will all make sense."
"You might indeed be a sucker, not that that's even necessarily a bad thing. I say that as someone who doesn't think he manufactured tears on trial. I don't think he was faking, or even playing up, his emotions. However, the clips of him saying he'd fire shots at the black dudes he perceived shoplifting (""if he had his AR"") a few weeks before the Kenosha events, the clip of him repeatedly swinging on the back of a girl's head who was physically engaging with his sister (instead of just pulling her away as he could have easily done and as was being done to his sister by a guy with more sense), among other things, speak to something other than good intentions. I think they speak to a more dangerous, violent, and hateful person lurking right beneath the surface, looking for opportunities to come out. (Sure enough, he found himself an opportunity).  Lord knows, most people can't/won't actually pull the trigger to kill another human being when push comes to shove, even if they think they might get beat up, even if they think they might die (ever heard about how many people in war, who are literally trained to kill, can't bring themselves to actually fire accurately towards the enemy?). Let's be real, the most likely dangerous scenario for Kyle is that he would have been disarmed and possibly beaten up in Kenosha. Is it *possible* that the people would have literally killed him, with cameras all around and police all over? It's possible, but incredibly unlikely. As soon as he was disarmed and cowering, he most likely would have been ridiculed and *possibly* roughed up a little (this doesn't mean I think he was guilty of murder; the jury made the right call).  Kyle's super young and clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed. You could say he has good intentions in the way that basically everyone has good intentions, but I don't think that's really a particularly accurate way to characterize him. I both feel and fear for people like him. I don't expect he's going to have a happy, easy, or fulfilling future."
"What do you think of the guy Rittenhouse got to straw buy his AR-15?  Was he a pedo?  He was 19 and was dating “Kyle’s” 14 year old little sister.  Just asking questions, did “Kyle” serve up his little sister in exchange for assault weapons?"
"You cannot open carry a gun you don’t legally own.  How is it that all of you people arguing this seem to just ignore this point?  The gun was bought by someone else fraudulently, he did not own it and therefore did not have the right to possess it, much less open carry it.  You’re right, the other guy was also illegally carrying a gun.  Let’s try him for carrying it illegally and discharging it at someone.  If he’s guilty, punish him.  Him carrying a gun illegally has no bearing on the illegality of Kyle Rittenhouse’s actions.  Comparing the two is a lazy whataboutism meant to distract from the real debate, which is about Rittenhouse, not someone else."
The only person illegally carrying that day was the guy with a pistol that got his bicep shot off after he pointed it at Kyle
"Bruh, I'm not 'okay' with really anything Kyle did.  That doesn't mean I want him found guilty of crimes he didn't commit.  How is it so hard for folks to understand the difference?! Because I don't like the guy I should want the justice system to punish an innocent person? Because I want someone not guilty to be acquitted means I approve of their actions? This tribalism and over-politicizing of everything is insane. WTF"
"It’s entirely possible that if the guy who pulled a gun on Kyle had killed him he would have had a plausible self defense (or defense of another) case.  Both people can have fundamentally different understandings of what is real that may make them both simultaneously right even if they’re both misinterpreting things.  Self defense law doesn’t require you to know the intent of the person you’re defending yourself from.  You can be 100% wrong and still have a valid case.  I honestly think if anyone other than the first victim who was a legit psycho had killed rittenhouse they would also have a valid self defense claim because of thinking he was a shooter.  Maybe not as easy, but still good odds."
"Okay vigilantes can roam the streets with rifles. That's your America. If the second guy killed Kyle with his skateboard he'd walk for the same reason Kyle walked. America 2021, the suicide pact."
He is talking about better gun control   That would mean that Kyle would not have had the ar   The other guy would not have had a handgun
"Moral of the story: don't draw down on a killer unless you are ready to kill. That last guy Kyle shot, the protest medic, was on solid ground to execute Kyle and chose not to."
"I’ll get shit on, but legally, what Kyle did was legal.  And anyone who has seen the videos see him being chased by men with guns, as well, attacked, and I think legally, he defended himself.  And people seem to think he killed black people? He killed a white child molester and another white felon. The third guy was also a white felon that survived. Pistol still in his hand bc he couldn’t drop it since Kyle blew his arm off basically.  Kyle went and asked for trouble, he found it, and legally, whether you agree or not, defended himself."
"That guy should not have had a gun either or brandished it    How I see it is that Kyle went there armed to a highly volatile situation trying to do good.  He is just a dumb kid, he is a victim of the propaganda around him, the shitty parents who give him a gun and drive him there.  I feel bad for him, I think this will fuck him up mentally in that either he will lean into the fame and notoriety or the fact that he just killed 2 people that probably didn't need to die."
"I’m in agreement but I guess one issue is - who knows who’s the good guy with the gun or the bad guy with the gun when everyone has a gun in a tense situation.  I think folks thought he was an active shooter and were trying to stop him - which in other situations, people are applauded.  I think the guy pulled the gun on Kyle thinking he was an active shooter and was trying to stop him and got shot."
"&gt; In fact, one of the individuals involved testified in court that it was only after he drew his gun and pointed it at Kyle that Kyle fired live rounds.  The guy who was illegally carrying (Grosskreutz) and never charged for it."
"The only victim in this case is Kyle and he didn't burn down any businesses, but the rioters burned down multiple businesses the nights before, that's why Kyle was there. The first guy shot was seen starting multiple fires throughout the night, Kyle was actually on his way to put a fire out when he was ambushed."
"No, as I've repeatedly said, I'm talking about moral culpability, nor legal culpability, you just seem unable to grasp the distinction.   Lots of people are not legally culpable for people's deaths, while still being completely and 100% morally culpable in any rational person's eyes.   Kyle caused these deaths by showing up to counter protest and defend the property of a used car lot owner with an assault rifle. The guy who pulled a glock on him is also culpable, but that doesn't absolve Kyle of his role in what happened."
"People don’t realize that people on the left can also be crazy as fuck. There was a literal mob of people *chasing and rushing* a guy with an AR-15… on video, indisputable evidence, and people still somehow use mental gymnastics to defend them. Like, think of how dumb you’d have to be to bum rush a dude with a gun that’s running away from you. Maybe… just *maybe* you decide to … let the guy go? What were they expecting? For kyle to be like “okay yeah, attack me go ahead”."
"Doesn’t the same “self defense” argument apply to skateboard guy?  Kyle was an active shooter, waving an assault rifle. Skateboard dude feared for his life &amp; attacked in self defense.  That’s why vigilantism is a slippery slope. Kyle legally executed three people in “self defense”. I don’t understand why that should be OK."
"you do know one of the people who was attacking him was consistently screaming the n word in the air. the guy who said he would kill him literally tried to steal the gun from his hands to kill him. that same guy was helping burn shit down, light a trash can on fire. there is always testimony that kyle had used a first aid to help a couple of the people who were rioting. there wasnt a single witness that they could find that he provoked a single person. kyle put out a flaming dumpster which the other people were trying to use to push towards a gas station. the guiy who threatened to kill him also sexually abused 5 9-11 year old boys and also just got out of the hospital from a suicide attempt. so yes there is many chances for someone to threaten kyle for doing something he didnt like"
"Really? Because the genius child molester is chasing a guy with an ar-15.  You don’t think if he catches him without the gun he’d be alive, because he tried to attack him while Kyle held the gun."
"I mean we all know Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacist hero already, I can see him being a House Rep by 2030 and a GOP Presidential candidate by 2040.   Nothing wins over white suburban moms more than a white guy who injures/kills folks (supposedly) pro black activists.   Time and again we've seen that the white middle class always rewards white supremacist hate crimes with political power and Kyle is on his way to that too."
"Do you need me to show you a picture of him with a proud boy? Here [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/14/kyle-rittenhouse-proud-boys-bar/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/14/kyle-rittenhouse-proud-boys-bar/)  This doesn't mean I think he's guilty of murder, legally he's super in the clear. But posing with a guy who's part of an organization who wears shirts celebrating the holocaust and had a nazi insurrection and then doing that a symbol they use to identify themselves isn't trolling.   And I'm not saying he was linked with them at the time of the killings either, there's no proof of that. What I am saying is he's a dickhead, and I'd be willing to place a really large amount of money that he is least kind of racist or likes the attention that they give him"
"It's not about the legality of him defending himself - it's the precedent of a child arming themselves, travelling to a site of civil unrest, and putting themselves in a position to discharge a firearm in self defense *and that being legally ok*.  From what i've read about the first guy he killed, it's not disingenuous to say that if Kyle *doesnt* have a firearm that entire encounter likely doesn't occur.  From what i've read about the second guy he killed, it was incited by witnessing him kill the first guy - again, if he doesn't have a firearm and doesn't kill the first dude, he's not put in a position to defend himself against the second dude.  He's not a policeman, he's not trained with firearms, he has no business arming himself and heading to a known conflict zone, and as a result of him doing so 2 people died.  Was he defending himself? Yes. Did his own actions likely create the entire series of events where he was forced to do so? Also yes.   This is why other countries just shake their heads at the barbarian 'rights' that america holds so dear. It isn't keeping you safe, it isn't keeping you free, it just serves as a mechanism for deliberate evil and horrible accidents."
"My point still stands. They were both rabble-rousers who had the intent of inflaming a tense situation by waving guns around. It’s not possible to know that the other guy had the intent of killing Kyle. One can infer he wanted to wave his gun around but not do anything because Kyle was alive and unwounded to take the stand. That said the perceived threat of that idiot’s action also led to whatever fear Kyle had that he was at risk, and thus the valid claim of self-defense."
 Not for lack of trying though. The guy admitted on the stand that he pointed his gun at Kyle before Kyle shot him.
"He didn’t bring a gun across state lines. Already been disproven. At every step in these events Rittenhouse met the burden of self-defense. The first guy (Rosenbaum) was *chasing Rittenhouse*, not the other way around. Rittenhouse didn’t shoot until he felt his life was threatened. The second guy (Huber) attacked Rittenhouse with a skateboard when Kyle was on the ground. The last guy (Gaige Grosskreutz) literally testified Rittenhouse didn’t fire until he (Gaige) had drawn his weapon.  It’s clear you haven’t been keeping up with the trial just based on your first point."
"The law is perfectly adequate for the situation. Why is it only a problem for Kylesnf other counter protestors to be there after curfew, but not the protestors? Why is it a problem for him to have a gun for self-defense, but not the many protestors who did the same? Why is it ok for BLM protestors to take it upon themselves to do, what in their mind, is vital for their communities, but it’s wrong for Kyle and the other counter-protestors to do the same?  Let’s be real here: the only problematic thing the guy did was carry a gun across state lines, which is ultimately not one anyone on either side actually cares about here. And the many people who want Kyle punished only want him punished because they disagree with his political views. And I’m saying this as someone who disagrees completely with his political views.  On the contrary, it would be a far more disturbing precedent to say that your rights are conditionally dependent on your personal politics, or that you are not justified to defend yourself when being attacked by others. People don’t want justice. They want blood and to “win”."
"The guy was not headed in the other direction. Rittenhouse was. Rittenhouse only shot when attacked, which is why his actions were considered self defense. The guy who got his arm shot off said that “Kyle didn’t shoot until I pointed my gun at him”. You’re spreading misinformation dude"
"I shit myself in the third grade so I have a lot of knowledge on this. I think it would be best to be in the wheelchair because when I shit my pants and was walking down the hallway, a lot of it fell down my pants. Depending on the consistency it would be better to budge everything up and roll him on out. If he would’ve walked out it could’ve started falling out. I’m no expert, I’m just a guy who has shit his pants a lot. You could call me the Kyle Korver of ruining underwear."
"Niang was such a good pickup, probably Morey's best steal since Seth.   Not a great defender but his scoring is on point. Got a bit of a Kyle Anderson slowly vibe. Great bench guy."
"Most reasonable Lakers fans saw his value from the start. It was just casuals who thought he was like his dad when he was the complete opposite. At minimum he was a really great defender and great playmaker in transition for us. He kept improving his jumper too which shows the dude was putting in the work. I'll always have love for the guy and like all our young guys (besides Kuzma), I was really sad to see him go. And it's not even that I don't like Kyle, the expectations were just different at that point and he was incredibly frustrating last year and it seemed his time here had run its course. Will always look fondly on his contributions for us too especially since he was part of the championship team."
"Your basically diminishing every versatile scorer and praising pure  jumpshooters with that stat since 3 is worth more than two? Kyle Korver, Steve nash led the nba in ts%. The mostly bigs shooting like 60%    Shaq, wilt, kareem, Michael, Julius Erving, lebron are bad scorers compared to modern nba players. That's why I compared curry to his peers in his era.   It's bias to jump eras where  the 3 was looked at as a gimmick back then. Plus the ts% I looked it up because of the pace of the game and possessions went up and down base off a time period. Michael jordan in 90s ts% is in the 40%. Lebron only been top 10 twice. When he can finish with most points in nba history and a career avg of like 26.5 for 20 years.     Again no one is going to debate curry isn't the greatest  SHOOTER, but putting the ball in the basketball would be ridiculous in saying well because of ts% curry is a better scorer then the guy with 11 scoring titles.."
Dwight never carried a team to a ring where the third best guy was named Kyle Kuzma
Literally carried a team to a ring where the third best guy was Kyle Kuzma
Absolutely. Miss that guy on the Cavs.   My first NBA game I went to was against the Sixers when Kyle was really early in his career. Enjoyed his whole career as a sharpshooter.   I still go back and watch him catch fire in the game he had as a Hawk.
i know i’m a laker fan but i’m pretty sure it’s universally accepted around the league who people are referring to when they say THT given that this is the guy we refused to include in a Kyle Lowry trade and chose to resign over caruso… I would get it if people started callin malik monk MM but THT has basically been referred to as such since he came into the league and started playing consistently
"You should read my full comment before you respond.  &gt; How is missing the postseason maximizing Lebron's prime?  Sorry in no way is phoning home a season good for Lebron. Trading away three rotation players is too much for one guy. Especially in a playoff push while your team is struggling with injuries. Kyle Lowry is not worth KCP, THT and Schroeder. That is a terrible trade."
"Kyle Lowry was 35 years old and was about to be an unrestricted free agent and the Raptors wanted KCP, Schroder and THT for him. That was the Lakers' starting backcourt and their best young prospect for a guy who's declining due to his age and who might have left last summer. Toronto was absolutely unrealistic with their asking price for Lowry.   Caruso, meanwhile, is on a contract that will pay him until he's 31 years old and THT can't even legally buy alcohol yet. The Lakers picked the guy who's already the better offensive player between those two (Caruso is obviously better on defense), and the guy with the much higher ceiling. Caruso at 28 is who he is, he's not going to improve, while THT very possibly could make massive strides in the next few years. When Caruso was THT's age he still had two more years left in college before he then went undrafted, having to then wait another year before someone offered him a two-way contract. Age is an important factor when picking between those two."
He's an [extremely serious guy](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/3TIOVgKyPgVD1qTwArvjjWPWcFw/1x37:1676x1712/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2020/04/14/885/n/1922564/f0a0a8bd5e9619a1dcbc18.10585734_/i/kyle-kuzma-at-home-style.jpg)
"So glad he's doing well, it feels so good to rub it on Kyle kuzma haters. Most Lakers fans were literally shitting on the guy, and look at him nowz striving away from a toxic fan base."
True but who else would we put on Lavine? Kyle Guy?
"Also, if Kyle was inbounding, there was also enough time for Kyle to step right to the 3 pt line and have the ball passed right back to him.  Person guarding the inbounder consistently turn away from their guy after the pass."
"Yes, his ability too shoot off the ball is a game changer. But he deserves to be paid like Kyle Korver another guy with a similar skillset"
Yeah it’s a shame because I like the guy but he’s been ass.  Kyle has bad slumps too but he still does lots to contribute.  When Duncan isn’t hitting his 3s there’s really not much else he can do.  Need him to fix that shot quickly
This stat favors guards who close out well on three point shooters and never have to defend in the paint. The only impressive stat here is that Adebayo is top ten while guarding centers. Draymond and PJ too to a lesser degree. Every other player here is the guy that chases Kyle Korver all game.
"I feel like teams need to start taking the G league way more seriously. 2018-19 G league stars were Christian Wood, Duncan Robinson, and GP2. Insane value contracts.   Honestly someone needs to get Kyle Guy a contract, imho."
"&gt; Westbrook has a higher ceiling but also a lower floor  More like higher floor lower ceiling but its Wiggs. He's consistently good on D and scores 17 points unless he plays teams he hates like the Wolves and OKC.   At this point we know who Westbrook is, he's consistently inconsistent. There will be some games like tonight where he puts up a triple double on godlike efficiency and most of the games he goes 2nd gear passes it to Kyle Singler's ghost to the 2nd row. If I was a fan of a team and this guy plays for us, I'd be extremely pissed off with how he plays. Think Kelly Oubre as the first option but with playmaking.  Andrew Wiggins is much more efficient from 3 and is played on a leash and now plays better defense than he did in Minny"
**NO!** ***NOT THIS GUY! FUCKING KYLE KUZMA MAN***
"Rough night for Kyle but I personally don't think that Miami is utilizing Kyle Lowry's scoring abilities as well as they should, the guy will never complain because he's such a team guy and does whatever he's asked for the greater good, which is why other players love playing with him but he's one of their better shooters and iso scorers, very capable of putting up 20+ a night if they let him loose...obviously with the talent Miami has not everyone is going to feast every night but on certain night when Kyle is in his groove they should just say ""let him loose""..."
"Kyle my guy, you're in the wrong here. Your boy is dirty af."
Well jokers size difference makes him different than the average guy out there. in real life a pissed off kyle lowry would make short work of anyone not seriously trained in fighting.
"Here is the Russ slander again. Every single year it’s basically how useless the guy is and then by the time the season has finished he has shown everyone how good he is.  Kyle Lowry is just not a better player than Westbrook like this thread has made it out to be. Does Lowry do things that would probably benefit the Lakers more? Most likely. If you were starting a franchise though no way you pick Lowry over Westbrook. I love Lowry and he’s the guy to win you a ring, but Russ has only ever been praised by everyone he has played with, and his go 110% no matter what is exactly what an aging, starved for energy team needs.  Lebron is basically the only Laker to play good, so it’s not like Westbrook is on his own. The team needs time to gel. Westbrook will come up big in moments we need him. If one of AD or Lebron go down, we will need Westbrook way more than Lowry."
"it's the same problem though. when an offensive player ""exploited rules,"" people would go in a frenzy and call it cheap. but when a defensive player ""exploits the rules"" and hacks/tries to draw bullshit charges/etc the response is always ""HAHA PLAY BETTER"" to the offensive guy. it's weird.  &amp;#x200B;  I read a post complaining that Kyle Kuzma wasn't able to defend James Harden without fouling and my thought was like.. why should he be able to? he's a way worse player. if the rules make it so that he can shut down a james harden, there's a problem with the rules. we've been seeing guys who were literally unplayable in the playoffs look like all nba defenders because they're able to hack at superstars and disrupt their shots freely.   I don't know why the assumption that physicality leads to better basketball exists. when basketball was at its most physical, it was ugly as fuck. I don't wanna go back to that lol"
"Yep. Him, DeAndre Hunter, Kyle Guy, probably some other big college names I'm forgetting"
You mean the guy who couldn’t even get a full season minimum contract after he left the Kings?    THAT’s the non-draft thing you want to criticize Vlade for?  Cmon.  Why don’t we just keep Kyle Guy for life while we’re at it.
Kyle Lowry ain’t a star point guard man 😂 he only won that ring because of kawhi and the warriors being hurt and lebron is not looking to run the offense all the time anymore he’s getting old they need a playmaker and a guy that’s going to give you offense and that’s Russ and honestly if you seen how dwade and lebron  it would be same style of play with Russ and lebron dwade wasn’t a good 3 point shooter but he was a great slasher/mid range passer same as Russ and they ran a good fast break offense and Russ can run off ball plays to the hoop bron still is going to run the show but it’s good when have another elite playmaker and ball handler on the squad and your talking about giving up role players but did any of those guys actually do something in the playoffs after AD got hurt no all three didn’t do shit so their not good role players
Do you think Suggs will be that guy? 👀 he’s such a perfect fit for y’all but also I feel like his ceiling is Kyle Lowry which isn’t really a 1a type of player
I hear there's a guy by the name of Kyle Lowry who's a free agent this year. Lowry/CJ/Thybulle/Harris/Embiid is a lineup.
"Kyle Kuzma is a rhythm player, it’s simple. If he is getting inconsistent minutes he will play that way. People forget Kuzma was a decent young player before Bron got there, and he was serviceable in Bron’s first year as a Laker. But once they got Anthony Davis and made him into a 3&amp;D guy, you start to see the holes in his game. He needs consistency."
"Morey ain't lookin too hot these days   I think everyone at this point knows he leaks everything, why would a GM even work with the dude. Like that Pacers package.   Let him keep Ben and try to convince everyone (including himself) that he'll have a resurgent career.   Just saying, this is the guy that said George Hill is as good as Kyle Lowry lmaoooo"
"I can’t fault anyone for picking Russ due to Klay’s injury history the last two years, but it’s not like Russ is any younger (he’s older, actually), and Russ plays a much more demanding style of basketball, which puts a lot more wear and tear on his body. He’s not 100% free of injury concerns, either, and certainly didn’t look like himself when we last saw him this postseason.   I understand your point, but comparing MJ post-(second)retirement at age 40 vs. a soon-to-be 32 year old is a bit of a reach. Even if Klay is limited some as a defender, he still has the defensive IQ that will (most likely) allow him to be an effective defender as his body starts to decline. We’ve seen guys like Iguodala continue to be effective defenders well into their 30’s, and no offense to Russ, but his defense is what it is.   It’s not like Klay had much more of a role on offense than a glorified Kyle Korver; I think that, at worse, he returns to the court as a better Korver while being a plus defender. If I needed someone to carry my team, Russ is probably the answer (and probably would be, even if Klay was guaranteed to be 100%), but on a team that has its de facto leaders already, I’d personally prefer someone who doesn’t need the ball in their hands to be their best. I don’t mean any disrespect to Russ; its simply based off of my team’s current needs. Klay Thompson at 75% fits most (playoff) teams better than Russ does currently. If I’m missing out on playmaking, or a #1 guy, I’m taking Russ, but if I’m needing someone to be the third (or fourth) wheel, Klay seems to fit that mold better. If we had Bam, Russ, and Butler, we would *need* Klay Thompson out there with Duncan Robinson to have any kind of spacing."
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it’s looking like he’s well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let’s see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I’d say it’s the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He’s averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he’s not super-efficient, his numbers don’t contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he’s fun and it’s good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren’t great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don’t hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year’s trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that’s it. He can’t pass the ball at a high level and he’s a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
Fellow Sonics fan also looking to buy a giannis jersey. I miss my team but this guy makes up for it with his wholesomeness and great story. Also I have 1 jersey and it’s Kyle korver. Not relevant but I loved him.
Im a knicks fan but purely talent wise Cam Reddish is more talented than RJ. He isn’t as good a player but just raw talent he has him beat.   JR Smith is also more talented than a guy like Kyle Lowry but talent only takes you so far.
"Yeah the guy you're responding to was supporting Trump in the previous comment he made and he also said in r/ conservative that Kyle Rittenhouse merely acted in self defense, but that he's a ""centrist"" lol. What a loser"
"&gt; They drafted Lydon who i wouldn't have drafted with the 60th pick. How come these proffesional front office geniuses with much better scouting and information than me fucked that up?  Dunno what to tell you there. Teams will reach for a gamble with their late 1st. Nothing is guaranteed at that point whatsoever. You can confirm this with how many players drafted after him are out of the league, it is almost all of them. They had some sort of intel that told them that maybe this was a little bit better of a gamble than others. Of the ones who are still in the league now only Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, and Dillon Brooks are starters. Not exactly guys anyone thought to pick either.  Luckily Denver also found Monte Morris late in that draft who is now the best back up PG in the league.  &gt; Giving Jamal the contract a year early your risk is fairly high while the reward is at least comparable as giving him the contract a year later . Giving him the contract a year later your risk is clearly much lower while the reward is roughly the same if not bigger. Surely you agree with this.  No, I don't agree with this because I've followed the NBA long enough and have seen enough lousy rookie/RFA/UFA situations to know that if you think your player will be worth that, then give it to them. Countless times they wait a year and it sours the player, it says to other players we are going to make you wait to get contract security as long as we possibly can, we want to wait for you not to get injured another year before we commit to you, and when they go to RFA they get to hear from other teams how much that team values them, how the team they're on didn't give them the max but that they would have, that they're going to do everything that their other team can't do if their team doesn't match the max. Whether or not they end up staying with the team, that has a huge impact on someone in their early 20s.   Again, this isn't 2K, the human element in this is a huge deal. That's why all these teams secure their guy a year early. It's not like the ""logic"" and math isn't obvious. It's that it's clearly outweighed by the negatives, considering if the player plays the exact same as they did the last year you're gonna give it to them anyway."
I respect everything he did for the franchise. Kyle and DeMar don't become who they are without his leadership. He transformed us into a winning franchise.  But he also had huge holes. He had to be forced into changing the offense by Masai. He refused to ever give JV more minutes. He made terrible in-game adjustments and he was far too unyielding in his approach.  He's a guy who will make a bad team a lot better but won't take a good team to the next level. Keep Casey there with Kawhi and we still wouldn't have won a championship.
"This Kyle Lowry guy is pretty good, who knew?"
I was afraid we gonna be ass in transition bc Bam is the only athletic guy and we don’t have any marksmen other than Duncan and Kyle Lowry but our passing that lead to transition buckets been stellar.. Lowry and Butler just been hitting touch downs like they been playing with each other for seasons now
"Shit, even making the HOF at all would be a amazing achievement for a guy like Lowry, he was bouncing around the league with a bad attitude for couple years before Toronto got him and he matured. Kept getting better, and helped lead a team to a championship (Kawhi was the best but Kyle led the team), and became a multiple time all star."
"Kyrie is only great at scoring and setting up people off the dribble. He ain't a better play maker, floor general, defender, and leader than Lowry. Dude couldn't even lead a little bit or make his team better when he was the guy in Cleveland or Boston. Kyrie is more of a 2/3rd option scorer on a champion team like Kyle but I'd rather have Lowry literally any day of the week cause he'll give you 15, 8 assists, defense and charges every game."
I don't know what you're smoking. Kyle Lowry is known for his gritty defense. Like why is a guy with a flair from a team that doesn't exist anymore acting like he even watches games.
"going after Lowry was always going to be a PR move as a way for the FO to tell their fans that ""hey, we tried to get this guy, didn't work out""; it never was anything that materialized beyond an exploratory phone call at best.  why the fuck would he agree to a move to a team that isn't close to contending for anything at the trade deadline?  masai wasn't just going to move him anywhere without his input.  I could've seen kyle go to Philly, Dallas, Miami, etc at the deadline, but New Orleans, no fucking way."
"Don't see why he can't, he's freed from PG duties and can concentrate on getting buckets and being an All-NBA defensive player.   If only we could've gotten that Kyle Lowry guy... :["
"Sure he’s not Kyle in the pick and roll but I have no issue with his playmaking and passing.  The ball moves well with him out there.    I know we feel entitled to the bucket when we see our guy open and cruising in for a layup and it’s  hard to swallow when it doesn’t work out , but that’s a small price to pay for all you get elsewhere."
"Lowery was every bit the player he is now, Jonas, Carroll, Cory Joseph, Patterson back when he was good. That was a deeper team than the Bulls with Noah, Taj, trick-or-treat Mirotich, and washed Pau. And you don’t even want to talk about that Wade Rondo season…  And Noah might have finished top 5 in MVP and I love that guy he was one of the 2 best centers in the league at the time with Marc. However that was at a time without the kinda top end talent we have at the position now and he wasn’t one of the 15 best players in the league. The fact that one of our best offensive options was going point Joakim was pretty telling how limited those teams were from a offensive standpoint.  And playing playoff results over a short period of time doesn’t tell the story. Matchups and injuries play way to large a roll in the small samples sizes of playoff runs. Tying team playoff performance to a single guy like that is dumb anyway. See one Chris Paul, was he not that good before last season?  I was watching obscene amounts of basketball from 2012-2017 several games a night and especially the Eastern conference since I really enjoyed watching a lot of those teams like the Wall Wizards, Demar and Kyle Raptors, PG Pacers, on and on. Jimmy was just a better player. But don’t get me wrong Demar was great, deserving winner of multiple All-NBA spots not calling him some scrub or anything here."
"People don't realize the giant impact Kyle has on the court until they're watching him regularly. I'm sad he's not a Raptor anymore, but I'm happy another fan base gets to see how good this guy is at everything.  Has he even scored 10 points in a game yet? I don't think he has and Heat fans are universally praising his performance thus far. That's the Lowry impact."
"I think the trade worked out either way. Goran wasn't going to get his option picked up unless it was to match salary for Kyle, so he gets $19 million this year to chill and will most likely get bought out at the deadline and sign with a contender.   Kyle makes you guys a contender and the Raptors org did right by him to make sure he got to go where he wanted to go while also getting the bag.  Precious was who Masai really wanted (and was trying to trade up to draft in 2020), so we got a guy to develop who also gets an opportunity he was realistically never going to get while playing behind Bam and on a team that is contending for a chip."
"&gt; Historical revisionism colours it as Kyle's team, but Demar was always the guy until he got traded - it was very much his team  It depends on part of history. I've had this back and forth with various people on various sides. DeMar is legit. He made an all-nba for a reason, and I can say he's better now then when he was making those all-star teams. He was the #1 scoring option for a #1 seeded team and a team that made the ECF in 2016 (you know, the year, the Dubs went 73-9, Spurs went 65-12, &amp; OKC took the Dubs to 7). You don't get that way unless you're a star and a great scorer....    ... Kyle was the guy that made the team run. He was the most important part to that team. He made the team run and knew how to run that team. But he's not the scorer that DeMar is. Hell, few are.     In these talks we like to black &amp; white ideas... ""who is the most important"", the real, unsexy answer is... everyone. It's a team sport, you're not going to win without multiple great players on your team.    What DeMar has shown this year is that he's still that dude. And with great teammates, he's be the head of a (hopefully) very good team."
"We need to reclaim this as a ""You just lost to"" meme. If we are the bubble Guppies then what does that make the teams that dont beat us?   Real talk though our team got to those finals because of many factors coming together. If I were to name a few, Duncans breakout shooting year, Tyler and (to a lesser extent purhaps )Kendricks amazing Rookie campaigns. Bam making a major leap to All-Star level Center, and Jimmy turning on god mode.  Another big part was Goran Dragics elite scoring and playmaking abilities. Last season the limited offseason took its toll on the players both physically and mentally and I think one of the most notable ones was Goran. Of course he wasnt the only one, what woth general decreased effort, herros struggles in his sophmore season, losing Crowder, ect.   But now that we have Lowry, We have regained the missing skills Goran contributed and more as Kyle also is an amazing defender and his outlets seem to really drive our teams pace.   We also got a guy with elite defense at the 4 which was what crowder brought us 2 seasons back and was another key element we were missing last year. Arizais a great defender of course and did his best but didnt have the strength we needed at the 4 position.  And Tyler Herro has effectively reclaimed the high volume scoring 6th mam spot that him amd dragic gave us in the19-20 season.  Dedmon and Morris are solid backups at the big man positions and im very glad we got them and the end of bench huys like Martin, Vincent, Yurtseven, give is great histle when they get thier chances.   Oberall this team has been exciting and its too early to get our hopes up too much but whay weve seen is very impressive and that makes it hard not to get our hopes up."
"Almost like they're more into narratives than actually watching games. Dude was the franchise player of one of the best teams in the league for almost half a decade and led them to the ECF in one season and the number 1 seed in another.   You don't do that if you're not playing winning basketball. Historical revisionism colours it as Kyle's team, but Demar was always the guy until he got traded - it was very much his team (which doesn't discredit anything Kyle did, he was amazing as well, and ultimately got the ring). Heck, he dragged the Spurs to the play-in in a ridiculously competitive west, where the second best player was either Murray, White or Rudy - all good players, but not real no. 1/no. 2 options just yet."
the guy who made a thread about kyle being washed spoke his shooting into existence LOL
Kyle will have those numbers and still always have a high +/- guy on the court for a reason  But his offence will go back to the median
"After the pre game festivities of Kyle Lowrys return to Toronto, we need to have a post game coronation of Scottie Barnes as the new king of the North. Seriously is impossible not to love this guy already"
He's getting paid a pile of money he doesn't deserve...a pile of money the Heat offered him solely to use him as matching salary. That decision helped net them Kyle Lowry.   I'd say getting your guy way more than he's worth is good agenting.
That guy deleted his comment But i was going to point out it was a freak accident. Mitchell Robinson and the Knicks in general were playing hard physical defense and didn’t allow the free dunk. It was also ruled as a flagrant so it wasn’t ignored.    Either way...shit like this sucks but we all know that injuries happen in this sport and effect both the regular season and the playoffs. Shit definitely sucks though...hopefully the Bulls recover from this. Injuries definitely happen to every team though.  Kyle got flipped on his elbow against the Nets and Bam ran into someones knee as well. Jokic also got injured the other night. This shit sucks..
Kyle Guy obviously on a 2-way with the South Bay Lakers
"Things to like:  We strapped in and after being down 25-5 came back.   Jalen is looking GREAT! If he can be a secondary ball handler and do 16/4/6 then that’s what we need. I’ve said for over a year now he has the potential to be Kyle Lowry.  Maxi! Looked great! He won’t do that every game but he always brings defense and can score  The defense as a whole looked very good and has post hawks. I saw deflections, tipped balls, steals, blocks, shot clock violations, and even just really good man defense from guys that knocked the Spurs out of rhythm  Luka shot pretty well besides…  God damn free throws! We play again tomorrow but at our next practice each guy shouldn’t be allowed to leave until they make 100 this is ridiculous. If we were 10/14 (72%) we win this game by 10 points. Ugh.  The team still hasn’t quite found their rhythm yet, but we’re 3-1, I’ll take it"
