"Asking as I haven't seen too many full matches in my life: what's the point of bringing in a two-way like Garrison Mathews in the game so early? I mean, the Wizards aren't looking like a real team as of now but I doubt a G-League player can make things any better."
what a moment  * beal nails a 3  * harris is fumbling with the ball with his head down and thinks durant is still open on the sideline  * garrison mathews with the heads up play to be in the right place to get the steal  * Westbrook with the crazy go ahead 3
GARRISON FUCKING MATHEWS HAS GOTTA GET MORE MINUTES
Garrison Mathews - professional shooter
Do I need to buy a Garrison Mathews jersey now after that steal?
WHO IS GARRISON MATHEWS????
At least Garrison Mathews played ok
"Agreed, I think beal gets gassed and collapses in the fourth but with seven (!) starters/key rotation players out including whatever the hell is up with russ, I don't blame him for going iso and getting points. The only other legitimate players today were Lopez and garrison Mathews"
Washington FGA leaders tonight:  1. Bradley Beal 2. Garrison Mathews
GARRISON MATHEWS

Garrison Mathews is the best shooter on the team. Scooty is an idiot for not playing him
Garrison Mathews   14 points in 11 minutes entering the 3rd quarter. Doesn’t enter the game until the 4th  FIRE SCOTT BROOKS
"Tbf, Wizards unleashed Garrison Mathews."
I can guarantee without looking at his stats that Garrison Mathews has more points tonight than all his other previous games combined this season
"Wiz winning this trap game with no Beal, Westbrook or Bryant against full strength Miami.  GOAT RAUL NETO AND GARRISON “MIAMI DESTROYER” MATHEWS GOING OFF TONIGHT!"
Garrison Mathews time
The fact that Garrison Mathews is one of our better defensive players says something.

Garrison Mathews gonna drop 30
You forgot the Garrison Mathews stans  We exist.
Garrison Mathews
I watched the game and let me tell you that Garrison Mathews had the best 0 point performance I've ever seen live. Man got 3 steals/deflections on Jaylen Brown in a row. Fun to watch him play defense
"What bothers me about Embiid is more *when* he does it than anything. Like...my man, you’re 280-290 lbs, don’t act like you’re getting thrown off balance while shooting a turnaround jumper against Garrison Mathews...  Much like Harden, he does so many unique things that are really fun to watch, but it’s overall not as enjoyable as it could be as a neutral fan when the foul baiting gets out of hand."
You do? You are happy he is tanking Garrison Mathews money?
Why did Garrison Mathews not play the second half after being steaming hot in the first half. Why did bertans not get a shot up in the last 5+ minutes. All easy answers - Scott Brooks is the worst fucking coach in the league (sorry Luke Walton)
"Ignoring the points and rebounds that he'll always get because he's a psycho, his playmaking has been sensational in past month or so, he's creating so many lay ups and open shots, this might have been the best passing stretch of his career, and that's despite Scott Brooks being on a mission to put the least amount of shooting he can in the game with Russ going as far as benching the only good shooter not injured in the roster (Garrison Mathews) on the bench for no reason to start the worst player in the NBA Jerome Robinson.  But hey maybe playing with Robinson has reminded Russ of Semaj Christon at least"
"1) Isaac Bonga (he is in the dog house)  2) Garrison Mathews  3) Jerome Robinson. Lol, he should be cut  4) Deni Avdija. Goofy looking European dandy who gets no respect from the refs and is oblivious to NBA foul drawing tricks as a rookie, and thus is much less effective than he should be    5) Raul Neto  6) Rui  ...  15) Davis Bertans"
It was Garrison Mathews and Russell Westbrook screamed “that’s an offensive foul” Lmaoo

From the title I thought Embiid grabbed Garrison Mathews left leg and was really disappointed when I watched the video.
"Wish we'd do this for Garrison Mathews, but maybe he's looking to test out the RFA market."
Or Garrison Mathews a 40% 3 pt shooter
"terrence ross, garrison mathews, malik monk"
Garrison Mathews is what the Heat hoped Tyler Herro would be
"You're overreacting. Gafford,Bertans,Avdija,Garrison Mathews are all serviceable NBA players."
Wizards don’t look like a modern basketball team without Bertans. He and Garrison Mathews are the only floor spacers on the team.
You'll be lucky if we give you a lightly-used Garrison Mathews.
Garrison Mathews can't win with these cats
"If we're that desperate for someone to hits 3s, we can put in Garrison Mathews. He's a defensive liability but we're talking about replacing Bertans's minutes here."
So he's like the Bucks version of Garrison Mathews?
"i was with you until you said garrison mathews is a perfectly playable 3&amp;D guy. dude is a worse version of bertans. pure shooter who is constantly out of position on defense without the size. he plays hard as hell and is fun to watch, but he's not all that good"
Dear Scott Brooks: Garrison Mathews is just as talented as Seth Curry. Why does he not see the floor?
Garrison Mathews GOAT
"[In support of the points you made..](https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632?s=20)  &gt;Russell Westbrook on the key to getting Garrison Mathews and Davis Bertans more shots throughout the game: **""I don't know…We're not running around trying to get them open shots, so whenever they get their shots, they get them and then they'll shoot them.""**"
"No chance lol, all of that is gone now with their current playstyle. Here's an actual quote regarding that exact issue:  &gt;Russell Westbrook on the key to getting Garrison Mathews and Davis Bertans more shots throughout the game: **""I don't know…We're not running around trying to get them open shots, so whenever they get their shots, they get them and then they'll shoot them.""**  [https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632](https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632)  (I am holding out hope the offense can be better next year with Thomas Bryant back as a DHO big man, and a new coach)"
"Multiple reasons - beal insists on guarding Tatum because they're buddies, which goes as well as you would expect, refs fucked the best defensive player in rui very early in the game, russ is an idiot by cheating off the perimeter, bertans is garbage at defense and brooks hates Garrison Mathews."
Reminder that Scott Brooks only played Garrison Mathews for 8 minutes in a game where nobody else on his team could hit a 3
"You're right that a lot of what goes on can't be seen but there's a lot that can be seen that Scott Brooks fails to do or is just so piss poor at:  1. There is never any ball movement ever. Every game is Russ iso, Beal iso or RoLo hook shot iso. Now you can make an argument that russ is so good a facilitator, Beal is so good a scorer and RoLo so efficient with the hook that it's worth it - but it makes the offense predictable which is what leads to long stretches of the Wizards just not scoring. 2. There is never any plays for bertans to get free, making him take impossible shot after impossible one, though he's one of the best shooters in the league. 3. Rotations are all over the place and players never know who starts or why. Garrison Mathews started for awhile and was productive then 10 games later fell off the rotation. Same with Hutchison, gill, deni, neto, gafford and even rui. 4. Benches rui, their best defender and a very productive offensive player for a single mistake, such as against atlanta last week. 5. hates playing gafford, and loves playing len. This is self explanatory. 6. Loves the no spacing no defense rotation of lopez russ ish and neto together.  7. Hates deni. Relegated him to a spot up shooter, his weakest skill, instead of utilising his creativity, ball handling and passing. Also left a top 10 pick with zero development.  8. Ices players who get hot like bertans, neto, Mathews or rui on a consistent basis.  9. Doesn't call timeouts at pivotal moments and holds them forever until he panic calls them. Also never wins challenges. 10. Does not teach defensive covers and simple goals like more effective closeouts/don't leave your man. 11. Doesn't watch film - there was an earlier tweet by a wizards video guy to this which confirmed it, I can find it later if you really want to see.  12. Doesn't rein in westbrook's ill-advised midrangers, which he did in Houston to have a much more efficient and overall better game. If russ combined his shot selection then with being the lead ball handler he is now, the wiz would be much more effective.  These are just off the top of my head, can think of more later if you're still not convinced.   The reason people credit russ is not for brooks giving him more freedom but more that russ got healthy and could be more free. He can now attack the rim and playmake at a high level because he's got so much more control. He played the first half of the season with a torn quad (he should have sat I completely agree) with no training camp experience. With familiarity and health, russ was able to play at the near all-nba level he still can play at, which turned the season around (as did a softer schedule)"
Shoutout Garrison Mathews  Came in in the 4th hustled his ass off and contributed to the comeback even without taking a single shot
Garrison Mathews is the worst at this.
I’ve never seen a non-Wiz fan bring Garrison up lmao. Love me some Garrison “Heat Killer” Mathews
"I think it was a joke, but Garrison Mathews does draw an absolutely insane amount of fouls on his threes because of the way he shoots."
Garrison Mathews in shambles
garrison mathews and malik monk show up in my nightmares
We probably will keep Garrison Mathews on the cheap as he’s shown he can play in spurts and he’ll be there in case someone gets injured. Current lineup to be:  C: Gafford / Harrell / Bryant   PF: Rui / Bertans / Todd / Gill  SF: Kuzma/ Avdija / Kispert  SG: Beal / KCP  PG: Dinwiddie / Holiday
You mean Miami Heat and Brooklyn Nets killer Garrison Mathews?
But the Nets killer **checks notes**  Garrison Mathews put the dagger in your hearts?
That’s the Brooklyn Nets killer **Garrison Mathews** lead Wizards thank you very much!
Ah great to see elite finishers like Duncan Robinson and Garrison Mathews getting the recognition they deserve
1. Payton Pritchard 2. Garrison Mathews  ...that's it?
I would rather give Garrison Mathews a shot
"russ of all people should know, last year beal hit a 3 with just 8 seconds left, garrison mathews stole the inbound and passed it out to none other than russ [hit a 3](https://youtu.be/bMhYThof5-E) to put them up by 1 with 4 seconds left against brooklyn"
I can’t believe Russ had to deal with Garrison Mathews in the starting lineup as his best 3 point shooter for long stretches
"Even April/May when Westbrook was healthy- the Wizards were 2-6 with Westbrook and without Beal, the Wizards were 2-6.  That being said, perhaps it says more to the fact that the Wizards had capable point guards with Westbrook out (Neto/Smith)- whereas Garrison Mathews and Jerome Robinson were obviously worse at their relative position."
There were lineups where it was Westbrook Beal Garrison Mathews and Neto on floor at same time
All of my takes on Garrison Mathews. Celtics got a steal
TIL garrison mathews is still in the league
Big time L from Garrison Mathews and co 🤷🏽‍♂️
20 points Garrison Mathews LETS GOOOOOO
“The GOAT” Alperen Sengun  Kenton Martin Jr.  Daniel House Jr.  Garrison Mathews  Armoni Brooks  **End of civilisation**
God I miss Garrison Mathews. Dude is clutch as hell.  The Miami Heat killer.
YOU CANNOT STOP ROCKETS LEGEND GARRISON MATHEWS
"Danuel House and Garrison Mathews won us this game, I can't believe it."
"Play John Wall instead of Eric Gordon in the starting lineup, move Gordon to bench, give DJ Augustine's minutes to Gordon, cut House and give those minutes to Gordon too. Also too many low ceilings guys getting minutes. Brooks, Garrison Mathews, David Nwaba."
Garrison Mathews and killing the Heat
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
I'll miss Garrison Mathews.
