honestly thought Embiid was gonna go for 100 last week. never ideal to see Jake Layman trying to guard an MVP candidate
Jake “Dirk Nowitzki” Layman
Poor Jake Layman just trying to play some defense and chill
"The area where we draft well is hitting on second round picks.  Consistently nabbing guys in the second round that are at least of rotational value is definitely noteworthy.  GTJ, Will Barton, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton and Allen Crabbe were all second round picks that have had at least stints or more of decent rotational value.  These were all picks made under Neil Olshey.  Yes, you can definitely argue that our first round picks are not very successful.  Obviously Dame and CJ as first round picks were both A+, but as of recent, we've had some less than stellar picks.  The Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan first round picks both in 2017 probably being the worst.  Anfernee Simons as a late first in 2018 is still up for debate, but he's starting to look like a good player as of late.  Overall though, grading the Olshey era of drafting, I'd say the Blazers have been slightly above average."
Jake Layman
Jake Layman and Shabazz Napier exist.
True that’s for sure. Keep jimmy don’t give Wiggins a max deal and draft someone who isn’t Jake layman or culver or okogie
"""We need a PF who can shoot!""  Trades for Juancho, who can shoot (42% 3pt in MIN last season).  Decides to start Jake Layman over him, even though Layman can't shoot. Jared Vanderbilt, who also can't shoot (4 3ptA in 38 career games), will probably retain the starting PF job when Juancho gets back from covid, too.  ""We need a PF who can shoot!""  Minnesota."
Jake Layman
The Timberwolves waived him so we can watch Jake Layman &amp; Hernangomez miss open shots while doing nothing else.  Very cool smmfh
"I thought Jake Layman was an alright role player , but hes terrible"
"Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton?"
Jake Layman.
*Jake Layman has joined the zoom chat*
Hope they like Jake Layman
How else would we get to watch Jake Layman do cardio for 20 mins a game?
"Give me Jake ""the Snake"" Layman!  Team so far:  Sato  Jalen Smith  Aaron Nesmith  Shamet  Svi  Layman  Isaiah Joe"
dude idk why but in 2k19 the cpu made jake layman annoy the hell out my myplayer lol
"The roster shakeup- really, we just picked up a better bench and swapped Moe / Chief for DJJ / RoCo. We swapped a bench of... like... Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, and a parade of guys you never heard of on one year deals... for GTJ, Melo, Kanter, Hood...  I maintain nobody's seen anything yet with this team and time will tell. Similar to about 1/3 of teams today. Not saying they're great but Dame, Melo, Nurk, and Hood have all shown they've got more than they're offering in the last 8 games and I'm sure some of it will show up in the next 64.  They're going through changes, and until those changes sink in, they'll look like ass. Low assists? Of course, the system was ass for assists and we didn't have the personnel. We've got the personnel now and are changing the offense some, so our offense is... muddled. We've got the personnel now for real team AND 1v1 defense, so we're adapting to the new tools...  People keep acting like this is the team. They're making huge changes without an offseason- everybody missed almost all of it due to COVID challenges. There's just no telling yet at all."
"jake layman is my favorite, especially since his name makes him all the more anonymous   great highlight dunks though"
Outstanding awareness from jake layman.
Malachi Flynn over Jake Layman at 274 is a **travesty** and I simply cannot read any further
"damn, this matches the garbage time I've watched him in. Not good, not bad, ton of energy and fun to watch. I'll take it. Blazers' last energy guy was Jake Layman and he's been gone."
Sebastian Telfair  Frank Ntilikina  Julius Randle  Harrison Barnes  Nicolas Batum  Willie Cauley-Stein  Jake Layman  Darius Miles  Gary Harris  Gordon Hayward  Kelly Oubre  Jordan Clarkson
Seeing Jake Layman always reminds me how he was probably 3rd best between Stone and Trimble on the Terps but ended up being the only one with a real nba career
I’d easily take Jake the Snake Layman
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"He is trash. Nit picking your post because you are trying to sound like you know what you are talking about. Yet , you start with Jake Layman a player on of the worst teams in the NBA . A man who even at UMD was overrated garbage. Has been in the league and never done anything. He is 6'10 and plays suspect defense. He cant score, doesnt rebound and gets by on being an above average athlete for a player his size. Yet he doesnt do much with it. Ask Terry Stotts if Layman is any good. Layman sucks bro. And you lost me when you tried to say he deserves to be playing the NBA. I guarantee you he is out of league soon. He adds zero value to a bad team as it is."
"That is Ricky Rubio (career 32% three point shooter), Jake Layman (career 31% three point shooter), Naz Reid (33%)  and Jarred Vanderbilt (25%) standing around the perimeter while rookie Anthony Edwards (who has less than 10 career post up possessions) tries to post up.  What's wrong with that?"
"Fine let's really take a look at this Wolves team then, and I'll acknowledge that they haven't been fully healthy that much, if at all this season.    They have literally zero reliable SF's or PF's to play big minutes (Jake Layman is a good bench wing, although not starter level and guys like Vanderbilt and McDaniel's will be good but still need lots of time to develop). Do not try to tell me either that Culver is capable of being the wing this team needs because he is clearly just not there yet.  Having a shockingly bad coach in Ryan Saunders for the majority of the season didn't help, and it wouldn't have made a difference being 'fully' healthy since his rotations and coaching decisions were wack.   The Wolves second best big man that comes off the bench for the most part is Naz Reid. I really like his game don't get me wrong, but to be a winning team in the West you can't have him as your second best big.  Constantly running line-ups of Rubio, D'Lo, Beasley and Edwards was truly hard to watch; and even just having KAT healthy and slotted in there wouldn't have made it 'that' much better. No defense whatsoever in that line-up."
"I wonder what Kyrie, Candace Parker and the whole BLM troops have to say about this. Equality they say. If this was Jake Layman instead of Malik Beasley man, we wouldn't hear the end of it."
yeah maybe he’s not just good he has had so many elite teammates like Treveon Graham Jeff Teague josh okogie Juancho Hernangomez Taj Gibson Jake Layman and more.
"Gotta make a trade  I'll trade you Jarrett Culver (6th overall pick!), Okogie, and Jake Layman for Larry Nance Jr"
Jake Layman +14 and we lost doesn't really count as a win
Shout out jake layman making this a game
"It was actually Jrue and that was what...almost 4 years ago when we just traded for Nurk and had the likes of Aminu, Turner, Napier, Meyers, Jake Layman...?  Dork"
The Timberwolves played Jake Layman who was putting up 0/0/0 stat lines in 20 mins over him. Life comes very fast
Jake layman was nice in high school
"Bullock is kind of similar to what we expected Jake Layman to be, but he's had a dreadful year and been played out of the rotation"
Jake Layman used to always kill the Suns
"I understood the statement as   worst nba player &gt;&gt; any D1 player  So I ask the question, is the worst nba player better than the best D1 player? I don’t think so. I rather Duke Zion on my team than Jake Layman"
"I mean just scanning through the wolves roster since I'm a wolves fan, you've got okogie, edwards and maybe Jordan mclaughlin and Jake Layman who I could see being good football players.   Guys like Culver *maybe* could get there with a lot of 'reshaping"" of his body, but even then thats a stretch"
"I have this faint memory of Jake Layman just absolutely yamming it on us at some point. I don't remember the game, I think he was still with Portland at the time, but he just kinda came outta nowhere and did it."
"GTj, Anfernee Simons, and Jake Layman all played 48:00 that game. All 240 minutes were split between 6 players. Wild."
Jake layman is sakura
"I know Jake Layman is a lock, but who else on that team is realistically getting in?"
Jake Layman
Disrespect to Jake Layman
I mean it’s Jake fucking Layman
Jake Layman
"Eye test tells me Jake Layman &gt; Lebron James, how’s that for your data!"
&gt;Josh Okogie shouldn't be playing and Jake Layman isn't starting caliber.  I mean we have Culver also for the 3 spot and Anthony Edwards was actually our SF for a good part of the season. And Josh Okogie is fine in lineups with KAT and D'lo since he brings good defence and with offensively potent lineups his non existent offensive game isn't that deal breaking.
I think frontcourt depth in general is what Minny needs but I'm surprised you'd say the 4 is in more need of help than the 3. Josh Okogie shouldn't be playing and Jake Layman isn't starting caliber.
Could you imagine the type of haul they could get back for Jake Layman?
"Imagine juancho or jake layman breaking out and getting rotational minutes on a competitive team. I think Jake has the potential to be a great system player if the shoe fits, and juancho is truly pretty talented offensively, a high effort player on the glass/cutting, and can rebound decently"
He didn't even play SG in our system until Beasley got suspended and we had to elevate Jake Layman to the starting lineup but thanks for your opinion.
I've seen Jake Layman buy a pack of cigs and a red Gatorade at a tesco
Jake Layman looks like some random LB
"Even if he is a wing the Wolves still don't have good wing depth and certainly no good 3 and d depth at the wing at all. It's not good trying to figure out if on a night to night basis if Okogie, Culver, Jake Layman, or Jaylen Nowell have to play 20+ minutes a night. With the big position you can get good minutes out of Vando, McDaniels, or Naz playing alongside KAT the same hasn't been true for the wings on the roster where either they're getting lit up by the opponent or are offensively unplayable."

"Jake Layman. The consummate layman of the NBA. Do everything pretty good but not enough to impress the head coach, be tall, jump high."
Yep. Him and Evan Turner. Sometimes even Jake Layman. All 3 players had me baffled as to how they were even getting payed to play. Some of the worst time as a Blazer fan for me I gotta say
Alright Wolves. Time to put up monster stats all around and then play Jake Layman and Ed Davis as a victory celebration. Drop down the tank odds and give GSW like the 9th pick not the 4th.
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"Jake layman. Ok shooter, ok defender, ok ft shooter, not bad at anything not good at anything either"
Only if we can have Ed Davis and Jake Layman in return
Sorry I forgot to mention Jake Layman
Here’s the full sequence:  Draymond Green fouls Zach Collins  Foul upgraded to flagrant 1 (highly questionable btw)  Steve Kerr gets two techs and gets ejected  Draymond Green gets a tech  Damian Lillard makes 3 technical free throws  Zach Collins makes 2 flagrant free throws  Jake Layman makes a 3  https://youtu.be/qv7GbA0R76U
"This. Scoring guards that can shoot all flourish under Stotts because he gives them the green light to get shots in various ways.  Shabazz Napier had a career resurgence with Portland. Allen Crabbe had success with Portland, and has struggled outside of Portland. Gary Trent Jr developed in Portland. Jake Layman, Seth Curry,   It hasn't worked out every time though with guys like Mario Hezonja and Nik Stauskas."
Where was Jake Layman when you needed him…
"We’ve had good defences under Stotts so that’s not true at all  His offensive scheme fits the players we have. It’s been wildly different in the past  We’ve only gone to an 8 man rotation recently and it’s worked.   We’ve developed a ton of dudes. GTJ, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton,Allen Crabbe, Simons. Basically everyone who comes to Portland has their best year(s) and fall off when they leave, Seth Curry is maybe the only player over the last 5+ years that has maintained or improved their production since leaving   Stop making shit up to fit your agenda"
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"Appreciate that bro. That 1 year was just a ridiculous season for Mass high school sports. We played Jake Layman, Bruce Brown, and Jalen Adams all in one season.   That felt like the last year before the heavy migration to prep schools, where any kid with a shred of D1 talent will never put on a public school uniform."
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
That means Jake Layman isn’t a pass first player
I was talking bout Jake Layman but whatevs
"Jake Layman? nah, Jake Dunkman"
Jake Layman has the type of hops that make him look like he floats.
Maryland Legend Jake Layman.
Jimmer   Seth curry   Sindarius Thornwell  Lopez   Thad  Jake layman   Satoransky
you can only win so many games when your 3rd best player is Jake Layman
Ben Simmons for Jake Layman
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
"I saw this trade on Twitter and it’s low key kinda good   Wolves get: Ben Simmons  Sixers get: Beasley,Kyle Lowry,Jake Layman  Raptors get: Rubio and a first from Minnesota in 2023 and a first from Philly in 2023"
"Let's see... Meyers Leonard, Evan Turner, Mo Harkless, Al-faruq Aminu, Wade Baldwin as the starting five..    With Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, Caleb Swanigan, and Jake Layman coming off the bench.   Basically the 2016 Blazers without Dame &amp; CJ."
Really make up for the departure of Pat Connaughton and Jake Layman
"I kind of understand how the Wolves won the trade - Culver needs to be another team's rehab project and most Wolves fans are just completely out on Juancho but my God your forward rotation outside of McDaniels is absolutely awful.  Ant's too small to defend the 3 + doesn't have the defensive acumen yet. Okogie's undersized and is a black hole on offense.  That leaves you Taurean Prince (solid enough as a rotation guy, but he's also an expiring that I don't see being on the team in the future), Jarred Vanderbilt (basically a small-ball 5 but okay maybe you can work around that with KAT), Jake Layman (oh boy)."
I saw Bill Cartwright in a Panera once and a friend of mine is Eskimo brothers with Jake Layman.
"Wolves are in a similar boat. Oldest players on the roster are 27 year old Tauren Prince and Jake Layman, both could likely be gone soon anyway. 8 under 23 as well. Hopefully we get some more vets on the bench"
We still have them beat right now. Jake Layman is our oldest. He's 27
calling jake layman an nba starter is quite a stretch lmfao
Jake Layman making his rookie debut in the fourth quarter for the Blazers vs Warriors and immediately scoring 17 points with 5 threes and a dunk. Man went supernova!
Jake Layman
Jake Layman
How dare you talk that way about Jake Layman
"If derozan is a liability, run Jake Layman!"
"Your starters through 6 man (CJ) are good.  Gotta fill out some depth with the other NBA players though.  You'd want Jake Layman, Mo Harkless, Delon Wright, and Meyers Leonard added.  Those can join along with your idea of Simons and Collins (if healthy) filling out the depth.  After that you get some less playable guys, maybe Evan Turner and Ed Davis.  That gives you a 14 man roster.    Insane guard rotation with Dame, CJ, and Beal.  Your forwards are spottier.  Derozan played PF this last season, but you'd have to fit him and Draymond into the starting lineup.  Jake Layman is a respectable bench SF.  Maybe Wright can get some sf minutes?  Zach Collins (if we pretend he's magically healthy) can back-up at the 4 and 5, then you have Harkless at the 4, though he hasn't looked good since leaving Portland.  At the 5, you have Collins, then Leonard, and a 'break in case of emergency' sub in Ed Davis.  I think that's actually not the worst 14-man roster.  Solid team.  Too many question marks for me, such as the starting line-up having some spacing issues, being weak at SF, and having several questionable NBA players.  ET hasn't played in a couple years.  Edit: I say weak at SF under the assumption Derozan would be playing like a PF still, even if he's in the starting lineup as a SF"
"Man… I don’t know what to tell you if you expect him to lead a team starting guys like Jarrett Culver, Shabazz Napier, Jake Layman, Josh Okogie, Hernangomez, and a whole host of other players who shouldn’t even be in the league. Now he has Russell, Ant, and Beasley, but they haven’t gotten a chance to play a full season together. What KAT is working with, in the west, you can’t expect him to will them into the playoffs."
"Our ""veteran"" player outside of Beverley is 27 year old Jake Layman. We need a veteran leader. We need a dog. Bev doesnt need the ball in his hands, he defends for his life and he is a good 3 point shooter. He is entirely what we need from a backup guard"
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
Fine we will throw in Jake Layman
&gt; Jake Layman  There's no way that's a real person and not a random AI on 2K.
Jake Layman is basically just Ben Simmons with a serviceable three pt shot tbh.
Would the nugs take a slightly used Jake Layman?
nah offers gone down to jake layman and cole aldrich's cap hold
"Timberwolves is still kinda up in the air but it looks something like:  DLo  Edwards  McDaniels  Vanderbilt  Towns   And then a rotation of Beverley, Beasley, Okogie, Prince and Naz Reid  Depending on injuries and form we then will have Bolmaro, Nowell and McLaughlin coming into the rotation  And that leaves Jake Layman firmly out with our 2 way guys"
Jake Layman Is a layman
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
Jake Layman
"Doug McDermott is like, a freak cutter.  I love Aaron Gordon, and Jake Layman is/has been a great cutter.  Willie Caulie-Stein has always been a cutting big I've had a soft spot for.  Naz Reid is coming along, his weight loss keeps adding so much burst and he's got such good touch on the finish."
Jake Layman as a rookie for the Blazers came out in his very first game and started balling
"It is, Anthony Dumbvis is a bum, you should trade him for quality role players like Malik Beasley and Jake Layman"
For Mavs:  * 2016: AJ Hammon -&gt; Jake Layman (46 -&gt; 47) * 2017: Dennis Smith Jr. -&gt; Zach Collins (9 -&gt; 10) * 2018: Trae Young -&gt; Mo Bamba (5 -&gt; 6) * 2019: Deividas Sirvydis -&gt; Daniel Gafford (37 -&gt; 38) * 2020: Josh Green -&gt; Saddiq Bey (18 -&gt; 19)
"More like two 2nd, Rubio and Jake Layman"
"Yeah fuck Simmons, send him to Minnesota. And you know what!? Trade him for Jake Layman and a 2nd round pick just to show him how much he's really worth! That'll teach his ass"
Don’t disrespect Blazers L3G3ND Jake Layman like that
Cool im sure checks depth chart..... jake Layman will step up big tonight.   We are gonna get murdered on the boards.
Nothing will ever top   Questionable - Jake Layman (Turf Toe)
Barnes for Jake Layman who says no
"LeBron, AD, and a first for Jake Layman"
"I was actually very low on European basketball before last year. I watched a huge portion of Barcelona games in their championship (best league in Europe) and in Euroleague since our stack prospect Bolmaro was there. In my opinion, guys like Nate Knight or even Jake Layman would be very good rotational players in almost every Euroleague team, simply because, albeit being outside of Wolves rotation, they definitely possess some basketball qualities. Culver, however, is as raw as he was 2 years ago. Absolutely zero progress in every aspect. He was given all the chances, he was even starting here for a while. I really cannot tell you what he does well to find an overseas team for him. Wish him all the best though, hope he can figure it out one day. NBA is simply so competitive league, you sometimes are not even given a second chance."
Taurean Prince is on the Wolves? Jake Layman is still in the league? I obviously don’t watch enough Minnesota basketball…
"It's 2021, the NBA has been dominated by forwards for the last decade, and the forwards on that roster are Jaden McDaniels (pretty good defensively, but ultra raw on offense), Jarred Vanderbilt (great rebounder, has some talent, but a bench guy), Josh Okogie (really a guard, can defend, is abysmal on offense),Taurean Prince (is in the NBA because for some reasons NBA teams always assume a guy with dreads plays good defense) and Jake Layman (is in the NBA because he's white so people assume he's a shooter)  You don't win in the NBA with 0 quality forwards"
I remember Jake Layman having a great game and KD saying he should play more
