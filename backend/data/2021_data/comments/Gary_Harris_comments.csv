I like Gary Harris but I would rather have a hot n cold type player than an injury prone player that always needs to build themselves during the season multiple times
Gary harris sucks and shouldnt ever near 20 min a game in playoffs. Who cares if eh plays d. He has 0 offense and his d has regressed due to inj anyways
Gary Harris has been hurt for quite a bit of time.
because they're playing gary harris 30 minutes a night
"definitely. Apart from having Murray who's a great scorer, Porter Jr, Barton, Monte Morris, Millsap, Gary Harris, Green, PJ Dozier and Campazzo are decent or good rotation options.   Sixers have just Embiid, Simmons, Harris, Curry, Green, Shake Milton and Dwight as decent rotation guys. Then the likes of Korkmaz, Thybulle or Maxey who are way too green for the current nba  denver has 10 nba guys vs the Sixers 7"
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
Nuggets were 3-0 when they had Gary Harris who brought some semblance of perimeter defense in that series
"You're actually right about him getting a lot more assists from hand-offs these days, compared to his earlier time in the league, I think you just phrased it in a way where it seems like you're hating and that's not gonna go over well in a Jokic highlight thread. Our offense is pretty slow the past couple of years though, so that has a lot to do with it. So instead of throwing lobs to Faried and weird-ass passes to cutting Gary Harris, he's doing more hand-offs and finding open shooters these days. I still definitely wouldn't call him an overrated passer though, his ability and creativity is still insane, you just see it less on a game to game basis."
Joe “Gary “Tobias “Gary “Joe “Tobias “Gary Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris”
"Gary ""Gary ""Joe “Steph “Logo “Ice Trae” Lillard” Curry” Harris"" Harris"" Harris"
Gary Harris did not hit a shot like that I refuse to believe
"We lost jerami grant and torrey Craig mpj has been a disappointement and looks to be only good as scorer without any basketball iq,gary harris offensive decline has been a lot steeper than expected jamal murray has returned to his inconsistent self and will barton has forgotten how to play basketball"
"You know I have always been a Gary Harris stan, not so much Thrill. They just can't stay healthy. I would love to see what Josh Hart would do with us though. I think he would be a perfect fit. We have to move on from one of Harris or Barton."
"Try to get Siakam for a package around MPJ (MPJ, Gary Harris, 1 additional young player and 1-2 picks might be enough).  Siakam is the perfect fit in Denver."
"70% of rotational players injured all the time!! And nobody talks about it!!! Literally nobody!!!!!!!! Murray played 20 games with elbow injury and wasn't able to score. MPJ missed a month because he's stupid and got corona twice, thenost his confidence. Millsap, Gary played few games only. Barton also always injured. At usual starting lineup of Harris, Murray, Barton, Millsap and Jokic we are 10-1 this season. I love how everyone is already writing us off lmao. Can't wait for the playoffs"
They honestly boarded too long already ready and let Grant and Beasley go without getting a real guy.  Gary Harris doesn’t even have value at this point
"When Murray was hurt and MPJ was out for COVID, Jokic was like the only player on the team. Was a rough start. And even right now, Paul Millsap, JaMychal Green, Facu Compazzo, and Gary Harris are all out. 2 of those guys are starters, the other 2 are important rotation pieces."
"He meant he wasn't a top 10 in the current NBA, he gave a list but I cant remember who he had above Harden, I think it was something like DWade, Demar, Klay, Booker, Butler, Avery Bradley, then I think he put CJ, Beal, Gary Harris, and Andre Roberson but I'm not sure"
Gary Harris + a 2nd for Oladipo just to get off the Gary Harris contract
A lot of it is probably just personnel issues and injuries. All of the perimeter guys and on the wings can't keep a guy in front of them but in the future a gary Harris who can actually consistently play and a good defensive 4 can fix a lot of it
"Oh snap yea that would be a great fucking deal for the Nuggets. Siakim is a great 2nd player, and would be amazing as a 3rd being behind Murray n Jokic!  Mpj is a budding star and that's what the Raptors are all about anyway. I feel the Raptors would need more tho like a shitty 1st or something. Maybe Gary Harris to replace Lowry in his geritracy."
"Yeah but he can’t really guard wings. There’s a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn’t move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I’m not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He’s been a lockdown defender in past season."
"I know I’m in the minority here but I feel like the Nuggets with Giannis will be able to run opponents out of the gym. They gain so much athleticism here and teams already struggle playing in Denver. Denver’s defense gets better as well.  The Bucks would send Lopez to the bench and probably start Jokic, Portis, Middleton, donte, Jrue. Our defense gets so much worse. We are also slower and don’t gain that much more offense than we already have with our current team. I say this all as a huge Jokic fan and I hope he gets the MVP this year but Giannis is the better more impactful player overall. I’d see Denver starting Giannis, Porter jr,/green, Barton, Murray, Morris. Or Gary Harris at the 2 and Murray at the 1. That’s a good combination of defense and scoring."
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
"The Nuggets have their war-chest ready and primed for a move. RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Porter Jr and picks are all worthy assets that can be used to acquire a star and upgrade the roster.  I think if this year ends in disappointment, they'll be compelled to make changes. I think another ball handler to take pressure off Murray and Jokic would help as would a 3 and D wing."
"I could see that, or I could even see y'all trading Gary Harris. Issue with trading Morris/Campazzo is that they're both on small contracts (at least until Morris' extension kicks in), which makes matching salary difficult. You'd probably have to give up one of the two + Millsap to make any trade work from a salary perspective. I also think Campazzo is only worth anything to a contender looking for depth, considering his age and skillset. That limits who you could get back further."
"Can you guys give us Lavine btw? We'll give you Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris, Will Barton, and Bol Bol."
"Id go Capela over Warren. Warren had a decent run for a bit last year and that’s it. I’d go Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, Jordan Clarkson and would debate Joe &amp; Gary Harris over Warren too from that draft class."
"u/Franker_Z123 has agreed to an extended 10-day contract with the Denver Nuggets in order to fill in Nuggets’ forward Gary Harris’ spot, League Sources tell ESPN."
* Luka will be a borderline all-star but nothing more  * Gary Harris &gt; CJ McCollum  * Mario Hezonja is a better Lance Stephenson
We shifting goal posts now? First it was this guy isn’t consistent. Now that he’s finally recovering from his nagging injuries and putting together a consistent run it’s “what’s their record?”.   Half their team has been injured and more importantly key defenders like Harris and Millsap who make a difference on that end. You saw what happened when they were missing Gary Harris against the Jazz.  People find any reason to hate on this dude
"Simmons, Smart  Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown (categorized as guard in All Star)  and my homer pick, Matisse Thybulle. Throw in Beverly, Gary Trent Jr., Paul George, Gary Harris, etc.  I’m not saying all of these guys are better than Vanvleet, I’m just saying he’s not one of the top 4."
"He had a rough start of the season, but he's finding his role these last games and taking advantage of his minutes with Gary Harris and Dozier out. He's averaging 14 points and 3 assists in the last 5 games and been solid on defense too."
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
it's hard to decide between   The rights to Dirk Nowitzki for the rights to Tractor Tractor Traylor  Ray Allen in his prime and a 1st round pick for a 34 year old Gary Payton who didn't want to come here and Desmond Mason   Or sending a 20 year old Tobias Harris to Orlando for JJ Reddick so we could lose in 5 games in the first round as the 7 or 8th seed for the 6th year in a row  Honorable mention trading up in the 1st round to draft Jordan Love
Trading the picks that became Nurkic and Gary Harris to draft McDermott is even worse tbh
"Better defense is debatable. Gasol and AD do a bunch of heavy lifting on that end for the Lakers. Nuggets have Gary Harris and Paul Millsap? Most advanced numbers have it as a wash between the two. Both are primary creators on their teams and the Nuggets have a better offensive rating than the Lakers so, if anything, Jokic gets the slight nod there. Lakers do have the better record though, but not better than the Jazz and it's right in line with Embiid's Sixers."
"Millsap was not good defensively last year, Barton was playing out of position and getting mauled a lot by guys way bigger, grant was really really bad defensively through the regular season, Craig tries but really only succeeds against one specific player type, and Harris I already mentioned.   Not one of them is anywhere close to Simmons, and frankly tobias and Thybulle are better than everyone but Gary.   Yes obviously a great center makes the perimeter look better, but an atrocious perimeter D will fuck over most centers. It hurt Utah last year, it hurt Embiid in the playoffs without Simmons (obviously he was still great defensively but again, only so much can be done),"
"And jokic runs the entire offense. He beats Embiid in basically every single advanced stat, and trounces him in the offense only ones. Like... offensive win shares and offensive bpm jokic is light years ahead.   Also, while Embiid is certainly the superior defender, no one ever mentions that he also plays with WAY better defenders. Simmons gets DPOY chatter also and is first team all nba and probably the most versatile defender in the league. Danny green and Harris are both above average defenders, abs Thybulle looks like a damn wrecking ball out there this year. Jokic has... Gary Harris sometimes. Jokic is regularly stuck defending a guard coming full speed with no one close to him AND the opposing center. He gets hung out to dry 2 on 1 constantly. Interestingly, on the rare occasion the nuggets play any perimeter defense, jokic looks extremely good. He looked close to dominant against the Lakers, routinely shutting down anything near the basket (other than AD lebron PnR, but that kicked Embiid's butt too).   I'm not saying jokic would be Embiid level defensively, he wouldn't. But it would be a much different conversation if jokic had elite defenders surrounding him and Embiid had the mpj sieve, ghost of Paul Millsap, out of position undersized will Barton, and Jamal Murray (who has improved but...) in front of him. The gap would narrow for sure"
"A couple of things to remember from the bubble matchups are that the Jazz were actually 3-1 up. You've got to be good enough to win three to then blow it. Also, the Jazz really missed Bogdanovic. He's so important to them. I think the Nuggets were without Gary Harris early on and Barton throughout so I'm not diminishing their achievements or anything, just saying the Jazz nearly won and they still had extra gears to go up."
"Nah, Sixers get better, and let me explain this.  Jokic is an average defender. The problem with Nuggets defense is that Millsap is washed, and Gary misses a lot of the games, while the other guys are unathletic and undersized. As good as Embiid is, he won't help with open threes and perimeter penetration. So Embiid + Nuggets get slightly better on defense, but they lose more than half of their offense. Jamal Murray is not a typical point guard, so he wouldn't be able to maximize Embiid. There are ways of dealing with this - if you move Murray to shooting guard and bring in Monte to run point, that helps utilizing offense, but you have to move Gary out off the starting lineup, and play two undersized guards. This would effectively mean Nuggets don't even get better on defense, and lose their offense. They get worse.   Let's look at the Sixers. Jokic would get an elite 3pt shooter in Curry, an elite defender in Simmons, good defense and offense from Harris, and like actual wings on the team. Defense would be fine. Rim protection is overrated. On offense, running your center at point changes so many things. Imagine Simmons as a hyper athletic, 6ft10 version of Gary Harris, cutting and receiving Jokic's passes, while Green, Curry, and Harris space the floor. It's like, Jokic can do everything Embiid already does on offense, plus his playmaking instantly opens up new things for the other guys. That's way more valuable than rim protection, especially if you have capable wings."
"He reminds me of ""young"" Gary Harris."
https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_ratings.html.   9th dude don’t know  what to tell you  Dude you used to think Nurkic was as good as Jokic. Answer this question: Who’s been farther in the playoffs Jokic or Embiid? There you go that’s all you need to know about your theory.  Also anybody who fucking watched the first 4 games of the jazz series knows that our perimeter defenders couldn’t stay in front of anybody. That was the problem lol as soon as Gary Harris came back what do you know we played better
"That’s mainly because of Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, and Gary Harris all being very good for them last year defensively."
Jamal Murray and Will Barton are below average defenders. MPJ is waaaay below average. Gary Harris and 36 year old Millsap are good but both have missed at least 1/3 of each season for the last three seasons. Y’all seriously underestimate how bad the Nuggets are defensively regardless of Jokic.   Furthermore the only true PGs on the team are Monte Morris and Facu Campazzo. If you replace Jokic with Embiid the loss in playmaking outweighs the gain in rim protection.
"a lot of the perimeter guys who are almost useless on offense seem more damaging than usual. Guys like Gary Harris, matisse, DJJ, Reddish, Okogie, etc."
Larry Nance  Zion  Joe Ingles   Gary Harris  Kyle Lowry   This also might be bordering on cheating too much with too many good players but off the top of my head what I came up with. Playmaking from multiple spots in general is something I think would help any Zion offense
I've always liked Gary Harris' movement off ball
Also this thing where Embiid's 2nd and 3rd best players are Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris and Dame's are Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr.  And he's in the west.
Same problem with Beasley. He wanted starting role and we need Gary Harris as our main 2 guard since he is our best defender.  We kept going back to PnR because it's only thing that worked on consistent basis and offense wasn't the problem. It isn't now even though Jokic is like 80 % of our offensive power. We miss Grant mostly because he was the only one who can defend wings.
"Because the Nuggets played him like a role player and gave him less shot attempts than Will Barton, and Gary Harris and likely planned on giving him less than MPJ too."
who do you suggest? gary harris and campazzo and this year's 1st?
Gary Harris has played tonight
LMFAOOOOO  &amp;#x200B;  that's that no Gary Harris no Jerami Grant or Torrey Craig defense... this front office is doing a great job
Gary Harris has been shooting better this season than he’s shot in the past two seasons. His defense has NEVER changed. Please check numbers or watch the games because nobody who’s actually seen these two players play would think anything Facu could do is better than Gary’s defensive impact regardless of his offense which has been trending UP.
"My argument was about “the refs don’t like him” part of the statement which is patently false. Refs love the guy, I watched him piledrive Gary Harris square in the back while he was already on the floor, no call. Every game he gets insanely favorable calls."
Gary Harris' return gave us a huge boost against the Jazz and Clippers. Mitchell wasn't anywhere near as effective once Gary was back.
"Bro Monte was out last night due to injury. Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Paul Milsap, PJ Dozier were all out. Every single one of those guys is a 20 minute player (PJ probably in the 12-18 range).  We're just not able to find our groove because everyone keeps getting fucking hurt all the time. We just played 18 games in the playoffs in October. Like... This team is exhausted and talent-wise worse than last year (IE missing Grant, Craig, and Plumlee)."
"If you watched the Nuggets you'd know the whole team is atrocious defensively, so him being more reliable than his teammates doesn't really say much. They dearly miss Gary Harris and he's the only reliable defender they have"
"I keep calling out this sub for the Bol Bol infatuation when he gets garbage time highlights posted for just grabbing a rebound and starting the break or hitting a 3 and it's completely fine. Even to the point where this sub was pushing this narrative that Bol Bol and Gary Harris is enough for Jrue Holiday.  But then when the THT stuff was happening in preseason, this sub was getting so butthurt over his posted highlights."
How is beal or PG not clear favourites over Booker.  Also Capela is the best at switching at all of the big men so therefore has the most value in the playoffs out of all them.  Gary Trent Jr is a ball hawk so I'd probably pick him. Over Harris  Harrison Barnes is pretty damn good and can be your 3rd all star and is shooting 40% from 3 this year.  TJ Warren would be the bench sparkplug with his 40% 3pt shooting and 20ppg scoring.
I had a Gary Harris &gt; McCollum take from a couple years back that aged horribly.
"Barton can play the 3. Malik can't.  Barton is a solid defender when healthy. Malik isn't.  Barton is a good playmaker. Malik isn't.  Barton hasn't been good this year because of the knee injury he suffered in the bubble. But he was healthy when we traded Malik and was probably the 3rd best player for us last year prior to the injury.  The real convo was and has always has been Gary v Malik. And I was on the keep Malik over Gary train last year (which was the heavy minoriy)... because I believed in this as his offensive upside and thought he could become a solid defender. But mostly, because Harris can't stay healthy... Same time? Malik has remained a trash defender... and so Gary is clearly a better fit.  The issue is that we didn't get more in return for him and / or that we included Gary. Not that we traded Malik."
"It is when you have 2 max players, and still have to pay Gary Harris 20 mil a year this year and next (and he's close to untradable). Plus they were trying to use it to retain grant at another 20 million. Those 4 contracts would've put them just shy of the cap, and Plumlee was... not good in the playoffs. It was very expected given the team's situation"
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris approves"
"Gary Harris swings our defense by like 10 PPG this year. I’m glad Malik has his chance to shine, but the reality is he’s a good player on one of the worst teams in the league. He wouldn’t get to do that here."
"your ""starters"" aren't close to what a superstar brings. Gary harris and some other bums aren't worth Anthony Davis"
"Combined, they are not worth half of AD &amp; you know it. When was the last time Gary Harris was even a positive offensive player for 3 games in a row?"
And if the nuggets have Gary Harris the entire series who completely changed their defense when he came back they wouldn’t have been down 3-1. Didn’t lose with him back.   Not to mention Barton who was a good defender last year before his injury.
"bol bol, mpj, rj, gary harris, 4 firsts"
&gt; Ah yes real 5 head play by Gary Harris to win the game by playing like ass on both ends of the floor really was the turning factor in that series. You are why Laker fans have such a rep for being casuals  Since you seem to know so much...please explain why the Nuggets suddenly turned it on after game 4 when Harris came back...
Ah yes real 5 head play by Gary Harris to win the game by playing like ass on both ends of the floor really was the turning factor in that series. You are why Laker fans have such a rep for being casuals
Gary Harris had 4 points and 5 fouls while Donovan dropped 44 on his head in game 6 lol you don't watch basketball if you don't think he's washed
The only players on the Nuggets not playing well are Murray and Gary Harris. Everybody else is balling. The problem with the Nuggets is their atrocious defense which starts with Jokic. It's very difficult to have a good defense if your center is negative on that end.
"lol Gary Harris averaged 10 a game, Bojan 20.  Maybe do the slightest bit of research before you open your mouth."
Is Bogdanovic going to beat LeBron and AD?  And the Nuggets didn’t have Gary Harris either but let’s run with it
And Gary Harris too neither team was at full strength
Gary Harris. He has been injury plagued and plays great defense still but right when he looks like he is getting his shot back he gets injured again. It is a shame cause I love the guy.
"Since the Mavs really need another facilitator behind Luka, I could see them giving up Josh Richardson and another guy for Monte Morris and Gary Harris."
"Everybody is so lost. Jokic is playing without Gary Harris right now. He’s in an I winnable situation with Jamal (worst defender on the team), Will Barton (ball watcher), and MPJ (actually he’s the worst defender on the team). He’s good at what he does. He’s much better when he has good perimeter defenders obviously. Right now the perimeter defense is abysmal."
Yeah the Jazz absolutely abused him in the PNR last playoffs. It only got better because their best point of attack defender in Gary Harris game back
From what I’ve watched he’s a significantly better playmaker and ball handler than Gary Harris. Maybe that was just from the few games I watched but that stood out as one of his best qualities.
I wouldn’t get excited about Suggs. I think he will be picked high but turn out like a Gary Harris level of player.
I thought we played the best defense the current rules allow. Nothing we can do if Gary Trent Jr. is making threes over tough coverage from great defenders. Also not a banner game from Harris.
 Danny Green asking for Gary Harris to be attributed that miss in his stats
Gary Harris lol? I see other ppl caught that too
I was literally about to ask if there were 2 Gary Harris' in the league lmao  BA pulling a Marv
Did I just hear Gary Harris WTF?
Gary Harris wtf.
Gary Harris makes a huge difference in perimeter defense for us- he’s one of our leaders in +/- and has been out for a while
Lol Denver's cast wasnt that good last year. Bubble heat was a real thing plus jokic. Denver starts gary harris and paul milsap. 2 guys who hsve 0 offmensive capabilities. Also have murraya and barton. The 2 most inconsistent starters in the nba
Not wrong but also outta pocket  Gary Harris peaked at age 22
Gary Harris averaged 17 PPG on 40% 3P shooting in his contract year as a 23 year old. Grant was a 26 year old that had never averaged more than 13 PPG playing starter minutes.  This is some serious hindsight bias.
"Nuggets fan here:   We lost Jeremi grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig- which was almost our entire bench unit. Jeremi would come to be a starter and then we’d pull Millsap off the bench, but yeah, our team didn’t get better. Isaiah Hartenstein was signed to replace plumlee but has not been playing well and he’s the only other center on our roster besides Jokic.  Combine that with nagging injuries to Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, and now even PJ Dozier. Our team is being forced to play 3rd string players significant minutes and play our remaining starters too many minutes.   We’ve even attempted small ball (maybe even considered “micro ball”) lineups, with 4 small guards and Jamykel Green at center, who are always outmatched and cannot make up for their size.   The off-season was not kind to us and even though I believe we could still make a splash in the playoffs with reduced rotation, we’re going to have trouble getting a good spot with a healthy bunch at this rate."
They made a mistake giving him a smaller role than will Barton and Gary Harris all of last season.
"yeah because team's can't make mistakes. Face it, the team that played gary harris and will barton more than Jerami Grant fucked up."
No team was willing to give to take on Gary Harris' contract much less give up a 1st in the process.
Love to remember that the nuggets chose to keep Gary Harris and Will Barron and trade this guy for a late first round pick who has played 23 minutes this season
"This is horrendous by the ref. Reminds me earlier in the year the Suns were playing the nuggets and Booker drove by Gary Harris and swung through and Harris sold the contact from bookers elbow on his chin, except bookers elbows literally did not come into contact with his face. And the refs reviewed it and still gave the nuggets the call. One of the worst calls I’ve ever seen in all my years watching Lol."
"The problem isn't Murray, he's playing through injury currently and is clearly in his head. He'll get back to form.  The problem is we have a coach giving players like Will Barton and Paul Millsap 35+ minutes a game. The problem is we keep losing players to time off, injuries to Gary Harris and in the bench and MPJ missing time due to covid. The problem is we lost Grant and Plumlee and we didn't add enough value to replace them. All of those are contributing far more than Jamal's stepback, I'd say."
"there goes his trade value, we’ll give you will barton and gary harris for him, deal?"
"Jokic, Murray, Dad, Thrill, Gary 'Gary Harris' Harris"
Every couple months I stare at Gary Harris’ bbref page and try to understand what happened to his wet ass jumper.   Ik this isnt w nugs thread but our game got postponed and i needed to share
"Yeah, other than some of the top picks it's a very decent draft.  Smart, Randle, Lavine, Nurkic, Capela.   Some other serviceable guys like Payton, Saric, Gary Harris, Kyle Anderson, Bogdan^2, etc."
"Gary Harris has his issues, but he is not thirsty for shots"
Surprised this is the first comment about Harris’ injury. Sounds like he reaggravated the hip (I believe they said abductors so maybe I’m over extrapolating) and if a huge blow to the Nuggets. Gary needs some health to regain his stride and Nuggets need him to be more than a defensive specialist.
Considering we were top 3 in offense when we had one starter that was top 5 worst 3 point shooters in the league (Gary Harris) and the worst finisher in the league (Will Barton) was absolutely incredible. Jokic was dragging a limping nuggets team to survival. Jokic is incredible.
"Great win, but Gary getting hurt puts a cloud over things. Over the past couple weeks he has been playing the best ball since he orginally hurt his hip in late 2018... so of course he promptly hurts his hip.  And this is why Malone should have rested Murray here and there as he has struggled through all these mi or injuries. Because with both PJ and Harris out, we are going to have to outscore everyone.  Lastly, it takes incredible cognative dissonance on the part of the media to are that AD &gt; Jokic but then to turn around and argue that Lebron should be the MVP over Jokic (or Embid)."
"Nuggets didn't have Barton all series, and Gary Harris for the last 2 games."
"Gary Harris although I think he becomes a free agent next season, John Collins, Lowry, Lopez isn’t a bad wing defender, ntilikina, and I’m sure I can find a few more good defensive players on the market if I did some research. Oubre is not a unicorn here."
"No one knows what Gary Harris' nickname is, not even Gary Harris."
Gary Harris good defence not good offense
"Ok fine how about replace EG with Gary Harris. I went with EG since I know he can be a starter on some teams but act as the 6-7th man on others. As a pure scorer, he’s definitely above average I agree with you."
Gary Harris
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris  Why do Nuggets players have the best nicknames"
"Something that has plagued us for years is finishing close games.  Mitchell and Bogey have had their share of buzzer beaters for us, but the way Quin's blender works, we feed the open man. In the big moments I feel many of our players struggle with confidence. I've also seen Donovan try to do too much in final possessions, most recently our second to last possession against you guys in game 7 where Donovan got stripped by Gary Harris.  Of our players right now, I really trust Conley, Bogey, Ingles and Favors in those final possessions the most. They just make the right play and rarely get rattled.   That all said, it's easy for our whole team to play well when we're up double digits in the fourth. Despite this very impressive run, I'll have a lot more confidence in our potential if I can see us win some more close games."
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris  Also not sure if this counts but Jamal “The First NBA Player” Murray
"Gary ""Benjamin Button"" Harris"
Whatever happened to Gary Harris?? He’s developing backwards it seems
"Jamal murray EXPLODED like he did in the first round ... guy, I’m a fan of jocic ... I hope he gets a dirk like championship...I really think he is a great basketball player..just please wake me up when he at least makes a finals appearance and doesn’t get waxed...which should be soon because he is UNSTOPPABLE... pro tip:  no one is unstoppable...even Gary Harris"
Gary Harris.  Half our sub fucking loves him and wouldn't trade him for LeBron and 50 picks.  The other half would trade him away for some ramen packets.
"No they can't lmao.  MPJ is the only valuable asset that the Nuggets have. Obviously he goes in any Beal trade, but the rest of the salary match is mediocre. Gary Harris? Will Barton? Paul Millsap? What does Washington need with those guys? And there's no way in hell Denver would give Jamal Murray for what could be a Beal rental.  Because of salary match GSW would offer Wiseman, Looney, Oubre and their first. It's a decent offer, but Oubre would be a rental. It's essentially two high firsts for Beal.  Atlanta has the most assets that can be offered and the 76ers have the best player available in Simmons. Tell me how Denver and GSW outbids them?  Go away nephew."
I'd argue for Gary Harris
"Just like every night, I am obsessed with Gary Harris. He's just beautiful, man."
"Gary Harris probably. Inconsistent offensive play brings out a lot of haters, but him being the longest tenured nugget and the anchor on defense gives him equally as much support"
yea i definitely don’t want to see a situation where he mentally psyches himself out of his talent. something similar like with Gary Harris but injuries also played into that.

"Miami has Duncan Robinson ,Herro, Nunn more players.  Denver has Gary Harris, will Barton mpj"
I was a die hard bulls fan from when I started following basketball at five years old in 1998 to 2014 when they made the trade of Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott. It epitomized our stupid front office philosophy and I couldn't handle it any more. I stopped rooting until last year when they fired Forman and demoted Paxson.
Yeah but Gary Harris was 40ft away from the Basket and Kaminsky can't shoot threes and had his back away from the hoop
ally oop to Gary Harris is a wild playcall
"Yes.  Harris has the right to the space he is already in, he didn't lean into Booker.  You can see that Booker elbows Gary before Gary hits him on the arm here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsZTq7dUYAEUlR0?format=jpg&amp;name=large"
lmao 🤣 Nuggets fans using one picture of a bad angle to defend flopping  Whats Gary Harris' address? Heard the Academy need to send him a belated Academy award
"And the Oscar goes to........... Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris!"
Monte Morris &amp; Gary Harris. Smooth buttery playmaking and shooting with elite perimeter defense.
"There was no blood on the towel, that man was acting that shit up. If anyone can find me a clear screenshot of any blood on that towel then please reply with it. Because Gary Harris a real bitch for that one"
"Barton scored 4 points during last second foul trouble   Gary has been on an upward trend but otherwise pretty bad efficiency   Overall, no. No they are not efficient but Harris has been an outlier compared to his previous performances and Barton didn’t really have a good game at all"
scoring 46 points in the second half hurt more. refs missed calls both ways. Gary harris was hit by Booker's left elbow but the camera view was blocked by booker.
Wtf what game were you watching??? Jokic getting mauled? You gotta be fucking blind if you believe that bull shit.  Jokic was flopping all night just like Gary Harris
Gary Harris should be ashamed of himself...
Gary Harris was bleeding. Wasn’t a flop.
"Gary Harris a master actor, able to summon blood from his lip at will! Give him the Academy Award"
Or when Gary Harris got elbowed by a ghost and Denver got a 5 point swing
Suns fans complaining about that offensive foul when Gary Harris was bleeding from his face.
Gary Harris is the best actor in the U.S
"Gary Harris being rewarded for a flop led to OT leading to Booker and Paul both getting hurt. This is an abject failure by the referees to protect the players. This should never have gone to OT after that play and it never should have been a Denver W. Talk all you want about blowing the lead by the half, the Suns outplayed the Nuggets until that play was stolen from them."
The nuggets were gifted this game.  The offensive foul by Booker on gary harris was bullshit  Booker didnt foul murray  Cp3 didnt foul barton.
Gary Harris mvp. Flop that wins the game.
Gary Harris
Was that not Gary Harris flopping? Am I going crazy? That challenge was crazy
How can you overturn that obvious flop by Gary Harris? Fucking hell.
"Definitely doesn't, you guys crawled your way back into this game, Gary Harris looks alive, Jokic is playing MVP level. I'm loving it."
Gary Harris has to be the greatest actor in the United States of America
A Gary Harris flop turned the game and then Devin Booker got hurt. I am angry.
Monte Morris &gt; Gary Harris
Gary Harris gotta keep this energy
"Can someone please post the ~~Gary Harris flop~~ ""offensive"" foul on Devin Booker that Denver challenged?"
Lmfaooo! Gary Harris will forever be hated by r/Suns
"Gary ""Act like you have whiplash if you're hit by a Mercedes"" Harris"
Gary Harris with the legendary *chase down flop*.
Gary Harris got all ball though. Shouldn’t have been a foul on either person.
"NBA players gotta be paid actors, because that’s some Oscar level acting by Gary Harris."
Gary Harris &lt;3
Holy shit Gary Harris is having a good game
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
You might be thinking of Gary Harris.
Gary Harris. A player who has notoriously struggled to shoot the ball. He improved the team defense in no way did he improve the spacing.
"I’ve been watching Murray for a while. He is a dynamic player but he isn’t consistent. His skill yo-yos up and down. I was geeked on him, Gary Harris and Willie Barton the season before last. They were on paper a great line up to complement Jokić then I kept watching how inconsistent he was and lost my interest  in him as a player. He even talks about how Malone couldn’t trust him to close out games during the 18-19 season because he was just too inconsistent as a player. He can hoop but he isn’t Elite."
"&gt;  jokic got demolished in the utah series defensively  It was more so Murray. He would get murdered on the screen and Jokic woud have zero help guarding the two on 1 with Gobert and Mitchell. If jokic plays up he either risks a blow by or a lob to gobert. He drops, then Mitchell shoots open midrange shots. Murray would trail the whole play. Thats why Gary Harris made such a big difference to the Denver defense when he came in."
"Depends on the player. I’m honestly fine with Murray’s play. Morris, green have been great millsap fills his role adequately. Barton and Harris have disappointed a bit. Facu is bad, very bad. Right now I’d say dozier’s not great but i think he’s out of position.   If we can get another wing. Move dozier to the 2, and bench facu, it’ll look better imo. Get mpj back will help that a lot, doubt we see dozier at the 4 anymore. And i don’t have high hopes for Gary and Barton but they’ll come around a bit."
"Gary Harris, Millsap and Barton are all above average defenders. Jamaal Murray is probably below average but pg defense is generally bad. The reason they’re bad falls a lot on Jokic. Also good rim protectors allow the perimeter defenders to close harder and play tighter which improves 3pt defense. Jokic is largely responsible for their bad defense."
charles would probably trade mitchell for gary harris and will barton
"You have to look beyond the record. Jokic has been utterly dominant, just as much as Embiid has been while also literally running the offense and setting up his teammates - dude leads the league in assists, as a center. He's 4th in the NBA in steals. Leads the league in PER, and is at or near the top in BPM, DRPM, TPA, etc. He's scored or assisted on 42% of the Nuggets made baskets this year, which is the highest percent in the NBA (next closest is Luka at 40%, and PG and Embiid are closer to like 25% each respectively since people are mentioning them). And honestly he's doing this with teammates that mostly have been subpar so far.  What I mean partly - the Nuggets have been incomplete the whole year. Murray hurt his elbow in the 3rd game and hasnt really be right since, missed one game but he's still bothered by it. JaMychal Green missed the first four games, and MPJ missed the last 10, so the Nuggets depth/size at forward has been quite bad mostly. Monte Morris has been steady as always, PJ Dozier is ok, defends well, JaMychal Green has been solid as a backup 4... but Gary Harris is still one of the worst shooters in the NBA, and Will Barton has been wildly up and down (and REALLY cant finish at the rim). Paul Millsap is incapable of finishing in the paint anymore, for the most part. Like, Jokic's teammates have really not been very good, and he still is just dominant (to add a bit more evidence, only 3 Nuggets have a positive net rating when playing without Jokic - Murray, Monte Morris, and PJ Dozier). It's not a stretch to say that Jokic is quite literally the only thing separating the Nuggets from being average right now in record (with the 5th best net rating in the NBA mind you), and being utterly awful, like worst team in the NBA. With him on the floor the Nuggets offensive rating is 120. With him off, it's 97 which is historically bad (and also the largest difference in offensive on-off rating in the NBA by a HUGE margin). If all that doesn't make someone an MVP candidate I dunno what does."
"it's interesting that there's now a pretty wide advanced stats gulf between him and booker, booker still well below replacement   there's also a phenomenon with zach, if you peruse the team subreddits you will see the most insane trade ideas for him -  nuggets fans think that he's worth gary harris and will barton, in the sixers subreddit they're offering tobias harris, and in the knicks sub they think overpay is ntilikina, knox, bullock and a mavs pick"
Based off last year:  1. Bogdan 2. Fournier 3. Caris Levert 4. Danny Green 5. Eric Gordon 6. Gary Harris
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
1. Eric Gordon  2. Evan Fournier  3. Danny Green  4. Caris LeVert  5. Gary Harris  6. Bogdan Bogdanovic  Downvote me and tell me I’m wrong. I don’t care
"well all of those players were doodoo-tier players before thibs got there, and some still are but he's found some way to limit the amount of damage they do   kevin knox was an abomination of a basketball player last year, but now thibs shackles him to the corner and he can stay on the court  randle been around the block too and no one else has really gotten him to be an impactful player   look at the other team nepotism coach, mike malone, also unable to define any roles for his players, has will barton and gary harris out there putting up unseemly efficiency numbers, barton near bottom of the league in just about every advanced stat 2/3 last years and led the team in minutes last year, forcing jerami grant to move elsewhere for reasonable minutes"
"&gt;it's absolutely true for good shooters  Just from the Nuggets:  Gary Harris somehow went from shooting around 40% to being a 33% three point shooter.    It remains to be seen how good Murray's 3pt% is this season but he actually peaked as a shooter his 2nd season before dipping a bit in his 4th-5th season.  Jokic started off as around a 33% three point shooter, then had a season close to 40% in his 3rd year then went back to the low 30s.  So either these guys aren't good shooters or your theory is not true.  &gt;people don't come into the league shooting 40% from 3  Sure but like everything else shooting has a it's individual limits based on your talent for it and it has it's up and downs.  Shaq is never gonna shoot like Curry even if he put in 100 times more shots than Curry."
This team needs 2018/2017 Gary Harris so bad.
Gary Harris
"Giannis isn’t even in the discussion don’t let the media and narrative tell u he’s a great overall defender. He’s arguably the best help defender, great in the paint, and for his size good on the perimeter but good in general. My top 5 not in order is: Smart jrue dort Gary Harris Simmons"
Gary Harris is severely underrated.
"Mikal Bridges deserves a shoutout in this conversation, Gary Harris too"
Seeing Gary Harris shoot makes me depressed
"At this point, we'd be happy if he develops into a good role player. I'm not sure that will happen with the Wolves.   He seems to have major confidence issues. Still shooting ~50% from the line, jumpshot looks broken. There were flashes of real development in the pre-season, but that's all disappeared.  He still has the outline of a good player - good athlete, versatile and disruptive defender, can attack the rim and is a pretty decent finisher. But obviously a pretty low ceiling without a jumpshot.   Unless something changes dramatically,  he looks to be a Gary Harris type player (the current version that can't shoot)."
MPJ Gary Harris and picks is a start
"Yeah, the Gary Harris plus (pick or non-MPJ young guy) construction makes a lot of sense for an Oladipo rental.  Gary has pretty much always, as their fortunes waxed and waned, been a poor man's Oladipo"
"Gary Harris, RJ Hampton and rockies tickets"
I think we are going to dump Oladipo for a team that wants out of contract like Gary Harris plus picks at the deadline
Gary Harris?
I'm more amazed at Gary Harris hitting that 3
Frank ‘Gary Harris’ Kaminsky
Gary Harris shaking in fear right now after reading this.
Gary harris is struggling to find a consistent shot. Murray has some injury trouble and isn't in his playoff form. MPJ is out.  Barton is trying to counter-balance Jokic's BBIQ. Team has too many guards. No wing defense.   Jamal's stat line is on 27 shots mate. It wasn't the greatest of games. It was a great half and a bad half.  If the team could get someone who can defend wings and hit 3s it'd be a good team in the west probably lmao.
"Exactly. It's also the same mentality that leads them to overpay to keep some of those young guys and that never pan out to the unrealistic expectations they have for them at times. Guys like Tyler Johnson, Justise Winslow, Gary Harris, Otto Porter (harsh?), etc. Never really bad players, but guys that they could've moved on sooner when they had more value to get back more productive players. I think Herro especially will fall into that category at some point."
We will give you PJ Tucker and Oladipo for Gary Harris and MPJ
Man why the fuck Gary Harris could shoot in our series smh
"everyone always asks what happened to Gary Harris but it was really only the one season or so right? could THAT have been the abberation, with all the great finishing numbers, and this is who he actually is?  also didn't Barton used to be a reliable creator for himself AND others? i thought his passing was part of what made him valuable. why's he trying to go full tunnel vision so he doesn't get benched?"
"Should be fun. I just remember us matchup hunting mpj and bringing millsap + jokic outside of the paint for easy pickings in the paint.   Are barton + gordon + mcgee pushing the needle further than jeremi grant + plumlee + gary harris did? Arguably yeah, but will they stop matchup hunting + dennis' penetration + new laker offense? Idk, they might but can malone devise that gameplan?   It's 2 new and improved offenses and defenses, so at the very least it should be fun"
an extremely talented wing defender that cant shoot for shit  poor man's gary harris
"Ayton loves playing Jokic as well. No more Gary Harris or Torrey Craig to harass Book either.  So far the season series has gone like this:  Suns win the first one in a game where CP3 was clutch in the fourth. Nuggets were without MPJ, due to covid I think. Suns were playing on the second night of a b2b, the first game was in Utah and the second in Denver.. probably the most difficult b2b there is.   Second game went to OT. Booker got hurt late in  OT while the Suns were winning, Denver ended up closing it out in a really fun back and forth game.   Third game was the very next night. Without Booker the Suns lost in double OT. Ayton was having a good game but fouled out in the first OT. Jamal Murray controversially traveled on the shot that sent the game to OT, so a lot of fans feel like this one was stolen. The Suns blew a pretty good lead in this one though so you can’t blame it all on the no call."
"Nuggz fans were missing Gary Harris in the playoffs last year, but it was clear to me Torrey Craig had a bigger impact on Don than Harris usually did. He's so strong and athletic enough Don can't get to his position on him. I actually didn't see how often he was defending Don, but your boys brought the defense 1-5 tonight."
Or Gary Harris for most the series.
"It could also be an outlier because they were in the bubble and Denver played horrible defence. Denver was also missing Gary Harris, their best perimeter defender, for most of that series."
Dwayne Bacon but once Gary Harris gets back he will probably start.
"Gary Harris was a big factor in playing against Donovan. Team is yet to see a series without a defensive effort of that quality against elite guards. That said, it would be a fun matchup and I'd obviously pick the Nuggets in 7."
Gary Harris.
At least we got to see future Nuggets legend Gary “Gary “Gary Harris” Harris” Clark
Gary Harris and beating the Thunder on a buzzer-beating 3 in 2018
"Lol of course you're kidding, Gary Harris still in the league"
"When is Gary Harris not injured? Really sucks because I remember him showing a lot of promise back in 2018 with Murray-like games, especially when he drilled that game-winner against OKC."
pRiMe gaRy haRRis
"&gt;Who tf is guarding Jokic?   Tyson Chandler, JaVale McGee, and Zubac. Lol.  &gt;who had one of the best playoffs that year?   You do understand who LeBron James is right? And you know this would be exactly one year after his legendary 2018 run?  &gt;Who tf is guarding Murray who averaged 24 that playoffs?  Lonzo/KCP/Rondo  &gt;Prime Gary Harris? A decent Millsap? Prime Will Barton?  Aight."
Who tf is guarding Jokic who had one of the best playoffs that year? Who tf is guarding Murray who averaged 24 that playoffs? Prime Gary Harris? A decent Millsap? The deepest team in the league at the time. You extremely underestimate the 2018-2019 nuggets.
Completely unbiased but  Gary Harris / Gary Harris / Gary Harris / Gary Harris / Gary Harris  and for the bench  Gary Harris / Gary Harris / Gary Harris / Gary Harris / Greg Whittington
Gary Harris has glass bones dude's always injured
Gary Harris and not playing name a better duo
"Read as Hary Clark, made sad Gary “Gary Harris” Harris noises."
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
"that's just the ""we will never trade Gary Harris!"" meme"
Aaron Gordon actually kind of resembles Shawn Marion in this situation. He’s extremely versatile defensively that can guard pretty much all positions and he feasts without the ball cutting/diving for easy finishes. Like Matrix his perimeter game isn’t world class but it’s serviceable enough that defenses have to respect it.   The Nuggets look like a championship team now and the only real upgrade would be trying to dump Barton for a defensive 3-and-D guard. Gary Harris was a perfect fit except his offensive game disappeared over the years and he was always constantly injured.
"I was debating a fan that didn’t want their team to trade for harden because they’d have to give up young prospects and also Gary harris, like wtf harden + jokic would be nutty"
I saw someone on the nuggets sub last year say that they wouldn't trade Gary Harris for Beal straight up because Harris' defense was too important
"Sorry brother I've recently learned to like parts of the Philly fanbase and it's an amazing City but their announcers are absolute PISS. Especially the color guy who is a toxic fuck, play by play guy just seems to say names wrong. How hard is Monte Morris and Gary Harris to say?"
Awesome trade. The Nuggets are the next Golden State Warriors. Homegrown and now players are starting to think they have a chance at ring chasing.   I'm glad Aaron Gordon finally gets to play on a contender. RJ Hampton went from a 3rd string rookie to starting. Orlando lost one of the best dunkers in the league but replaced them with a very enthusiastic and young RJ Hampton. Gary Harris was a fan favorite in Denver and always did what was best for the team. So it is fitting for him to make the move to Orlando as well. Denver fans really appreciate Garris's tenure with the Nuggets.
"It does for sure. And to be clear, ""big yikes"" in this context isn't necessarily an assessment against the Magic so much as it is just an acknowledgement that things really needed to change for you all. I hope things work out better for you moving forward. Really curious to see what you end up doing with Gary Harris."
The Gary “Gary Harris” Harris Gary
Longest tenured does not mean they built around him.   Would you have said the Nuggets were building around Gary Harris up until the trade a week ago?
"Gary Harris and a 1st were offered and the second player would be a young guy. Either Nnaji, Bol or Hampton and I believe Orlando chose RJ."
Injuries robbing us of prime Gary Harris sucks so much. He was so fun to watch between nailing deep threes and his extensive finishing package.
His advanced stats show that he's really a big negative tho. I hope he plays better. Man imagine a healthy gary Harris in this lineup instead Barton at 2. Goddamn clamp city
GARY HARRIS
"They don’t need a superstar. They need quality starters and depth. Vucevic, Gordon, Powell, Gary Trent jr, Wendell Carter jr, Theis, Otto Porter jr, Olynyk, and Gary Harris all got flipped at the deadline. Not to mention all the players that were traded at the last deadline or in the offseason.  At some point you have to pull the trigger. All of those guys are high quality NBA players unlike the everyone on the Warriors bench. If the Warriors don’t trade their own pick this offseason, then it’s clear they’re not trying to win. There is zero argument for drafting another project."
AG is low-key an unholy fusion of Mason Plumlee and Gary Harris
Imagine if the nuggets had a health gary harris instead of will Barton. Oh what could have been...
"I think this team is mentally prepared to get revenge on Denver. In addition, no Gary Harris makes them an easier matchup for Donovan and Clarkson.  The Lakers are still our toughest matchup, especially when they go big."
"In those three series he was covered by elite 1v1 defenders - Jrue, Gary Harris, and Klay. To some degree this was just a run of bad luck."
"You're right against certain matchups, but he was fine defensively vs the clippers, jazz run pnr so he was exposed and even that was without Gary Harris, he was fine when he came back lol. Even Embiid wasn't great at guarding pnr without Simmons to help last year"
"Gary Harris hasn't been able to stay on the floor consistently, including in playoffs, in years. Not his fault, but having someone who they can actually put on the floor is a big deal for Denver lol.  Even though I've never been high on Gordon's offense, he's also a clear upgrade from Gary Harris there."
Used to be Gary Harris. Now it's your janitor or something
Gary Harris on the Magic.  :'(
"I mean Gary Harris was injured a fair bit, and Will Barton was missed end of last season."
Gary Harris though
"Absolutely better than last year. I’ll start with Grant. In the pre covid part of the season Grant was a 6th man for us. He was streaky on offense and inconsistent on defense. He continued to develop and earned his minutes as the season went on eventually leading to his outstanding defense in the WCF against Lebron. That’s what non-Nuggets fans saw and thought that’s the player he always is. AG is a better player than Grant for our team, no question about it. MPJ is being ignored by a lot of people, in the last two weeks this man is putting up elite numbers, crashing the boards, and playing strong defense. AG opened up the floor for MPJ and since his arrival MPJ looks like a superstar. Eons ahead of where he was in the bubble. Gary Harris is a Nuggs legend, but he has been off the court so much with injuries these last two seasons and his offense had taken a nose dive. The team was clearly better defensively with him on the floor but our offense was still stagnate. Our guard defense was never bad though without him. Our wing defense was horrendous though which is where the addition of AG elevates the entire team. There’s less need for guys to come off their man or out of their zone to help the wing defender which is what was freeing up so much offense for our opponents. The last thing is the depth of this team now. With a healthy Monte Morris we have two starting caliber guards to pick from as a 6th man. Our second unit will be Monte/Barton, Dozier/Facu, Milsap, Green, McGee with some fluidity in the positions they play. Behind them you have effective guys like Nnaji, Gary Clark, and potentially Bol and Cancar. Idk if it will be enough to take on Brooklyn, but two weeks ago I would have thought we stood no chance against them. I personally felt we over performed on the bubble and that was enough to get us to where we got. This team is much better than last years and if Mal can put up 75% of what he did in the bubble and the team stays healthy, we can win it all."
"They're not superstars. That's like saying Gary Payton on the 2006 Heat was a superstar. That's like saying Tracy Mcgrady on the 2013/14 Spurs was a superstar.  IF the nets go far in the playoffs (a big IF considering the Heat and Bucks are on par and them+76ers+possibly the celtics are all definitely better if KD is not 100%) then LMA and Blake will be far down the list of players who contribute the most to their success.  Here, I'll order it:  Tier 1: Harden, KD  Tier 2: Kyrie  Tier 3: Joe Harris, Jeff green, Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown  Tier 4: Landry Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nic Claxton, LMA, Blake  That means Blake and LMA will be somewhere between the 8th and 12th most valuable contributors in the postseason when that level of player usually gets 8 minutes a game.  Really? Have their not been enough changes to benefit small market teams?  Apparently it's impossible for small market teams to win. Only big market teams like the... San Antonio Spurs can win a title or 5.  You know, if a front office focuses on player development, asset management, coaching and infrastructure rather than whining to the league when the nets or lakers sign a guy to play 14 minutes per game in the postseason, (god forbid giving up a 2029 2nd rounder to take Drummond away from the Lakers buyout option) then they too could succeed rather than infringing on freedom of player movement.  Honestly, the small market crocodile tears are pathetic."
"&gt;Morris and Campazzo are both better than Harris on both offense and defense.  No they’re not. Gary was our best defender, period. Facu has great energy and is pesky, plus he has the ability to make other players use the wrong 2k animation, so that comes in clutch. Monte is the best backup point guard in the league and reliable at both ends, nothing bad to say, but not as strong of a fender as Gary was. When he was healthy, of course."
Gotta go back 7 years for context but the Bulls traded picks that became Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic to draft Doug McDermott then traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne.
Yeah it's weird because I'm not sure how Gordon changes the matchup vs Utah. He stifles ball handling wings like Lebron/Kawhi/PG etc. but Gary Harris is one of the few that gives Donny serious problems on D. I think McGee is much better vs Gobert than was Plumlee. It'll be interesting that's that's sure!
"Forgot who I heard put it this way but they traded their best defender, Gary Harris, for their new best defender, Aaron Gordon. They’re not all of a sudden going to be a great defense."
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris was covering Kawhi last playoffs and he did a great job
"We are actually pretty deep with role players.  That’s not even including MCW and Khem or Isaac and Fultz who are injured.  Just this year if healthy we can start Cole, Gary Harris, James Ennis, Chuma, Wendell and have MCW, RJ Hampton, Ross, Otto, and Khem as our ten man rotation with Mo Bamba Bacon and Chasson as the third stringers.  If Isaac and Fultz were healthy it be even more silly."
"I think the best thing about this trade for Denver is getting Barton more minutes. The guy is just a far more dynamic player than Gary Harris, but could never seem to find a rhythm, starting and playing the bulk of 2 should be pay dividends for the whole team."
Also don’t expect more losing from us because Cole and Gary Harris should be coming back soon and that’ll only improve our play.  We might make the play in game lol.
"It’s pretty obvious you don’t watch the nuggets or Timberwolves. Jokic didn’t “carry” his team to the playoffs until 2019 when the nuggets had a starting lineup of Jokic, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, and Will Barton. If that’s a poor supporting cast then then I don’t want to know what the Timberwolves roster is. Also you said Kat was not a leader because he was the second best player on the team when they made it to the playoffs. That was KAT’s third year in the league, when Jokic was in his third year, the nuggets didn’t even make it to the playoffs. Why don’t you hold Jokic to the same standard as KAT, if he’s on such a different level skill wise, shouldn’t he have been able to bring his team to the playoffs even if they were poor?"
"Gary Harris , isn't really a name I associate with ad or Kyrie lol even though he's on DL alot."
"The best ability is availability. One of the reasons I appreciate harden is because of his durability. Compare that with players like kyrie, AD, and Gary Harris who you know will always be injured sometime during the season often to huge detriment to their teams in the case of players like AD.   Also it’s not just a participation award he’s been consistent, you know what you’re gonna get out of him. Pretty efficient scoring—yes efficient—and great defense. 47.4/39.7/70.5 splits. With the number of long 2s and tough step back and fades he shoots 47.4% from the field is good. The FTs are a definite area to improve on."
*and he traded Gary Harris too hehehe*
"Gary Harris was BAD. Everyone except MPJ (your 3rd best player) is a role player, most of those off the bench at that. Jamal and Jokic have been fully operational. My point stands."
Gary Harris missed 25 games.   MPJ missed 10.  Millsap missed 10.   Jamychal Green missed 13 games.  Monte Morris missed 11 games.  Dozier missed 15.  All of these guys are in their rotation and play 20+ minutes.
"Jokic, Murray, Monte Morris, Gary Harris, and Giannis.  Monte / Murray / Gary / Giannis / Jokic would be a pretty good lineup, but would have no answer for the Lakers. So it'd probably make it to the 2nd round."
I know I'm changing subjects and teams and whatever but Denver will miss Gary Harris he was the longest tenured player we had and I'm sure most teams have this but life is bigger than ball and I think we as fans can lose track of that but they are all humans with problems and emotions and just life so I appreciate it and I know it's not easy when I graduated college and had to say goodbye to people I see every day potentially forever but that's why you and me should cherish our friends that shit is not always a given
"He hasn’t been injured in Denver though. The point was that IF he makes a full recovery, the chance of re-injuring the back was about the same as a healthy person injuring it. But it was a big question if he’d even be able to play again. He’s not like Embiid or Gary Harris that are actually injury prone."
who was injured for Nuggets lol? Gary Harris? he is not a difference maker
Yeah I could see us just losing to like the Blazers in the 4/5 with Dame going nuclear and posting Beast memes about Gary Harris
"&gt;I never said anything about DLo firstly. MPJ was not even playing well until the last 20 games. Jokic has been winning for the past 4 seasons without him.  Yes but he at least had Murray for all of those games.... and the only great stretch Ant has had was the week after all star break. So yeah on the season I'd say MPJ has been much better.  Yeah he was winning because Millsap wasn't washed and Gary Harris was great also. And you were in the playoffs the last 2 years how has he been winning the past 4 years?  &gt;We’ve literally seen Towns with a good supporting cast of Jimmy Butler, Wiggins, Teague, etc. and the best he’s done is an 8 seed first round exit. Jokic has led this team much further with a worse supporting cast than that.  Wiggins had the worst year of his career in 2017-2018 and Teague was always awful. That team was also the 3rd seed for most the career and we ran into the 2018-2019 Rockets.   Man you really need to stretch the truth to make KAT look bad lol"
I am gonna miss Gary Harris tho.
Compared to Gary Harris' contract? Absolutely.
"Anywhere here been watching long enough to remember when a team could trade a player, he gets bought out by the receiving team, and then the trading team is able to sign him again in the same season?   I think the Cavaliers did this with Ilgauskas one year.  So like say that the Magic hypothetically buy out Gary Harris. Under those old rules, he would have been allowed to sign with the Nuggets again.  EDIT: Actually that hypothetical wouldn't work. I just looked it up and the old rule was that you had to wait 30 days before re-signing with the team that traded you, which would put it past the playoff eligibility deadline. But still, as long as the trade took place 30 days or more before the deadline, you would be able to re-sign the player who you traded and have him play in the playoffs for you."
"Harris contract really didn't matter because of how the cap works when you operate in the space above the cap but below the tax...  If Hampton had stayed in Denver I would have put $$$ on him at least turning into some version of a more atheltic Gary Harris with better reboubding and more playmaking, speed and length... which is actually something we badly need long term next to Murray. And his ceiling is substantially higher than that. Fundementals are just raw.  But Orlando is where raw talent goes to die so..."
"Ironically, a healthy Gary Harris would’ve been a perfect fit."
Gary Harris literally saved the Nuggets' season last year when he came back.
We picked up Gary Harris to soak up the bad injury luck on our team.
Gary Harris is straight ass the last couple of years.
He should have been in the Gordon deal not Gary harris
"This guy is peak ""I have strong opinions about shit I don't watch"". He told me like a month ago Jokic isn't a top 5 passer and Draymond is much better. He also thinks we got much worse because he traded Gary Harris and he was the key to us doing anything last year. Just stop paying attention to him."
Lol Gary Harris never even played. they got Gordon for RJ and a pick which is a steal..Denver will be hard to beat. They could upset the Lakers or Clippers
Hey man can someone link the comments in the trade thread 4 days ago when everyone said Gary harris rj Hampton and a late first was either even or too much for Aaron Gordon...
"People in this thread forgetting they lost Gary Harris AND Jerami Grant... Aaron Gordon can't replace both of them right? Yeah maybe Gordon is a better defender than Harris but losing Grant is huge too, Harris/Grant defended PG/Kawhi and now you're gonna have to pick only one of them to put Gordon on   I think this matchup could really go either way, people are underrating the Clips a bit and also underrating how much the loss of Grant AND Harris is gonna matter come playoff time"
Gary Harris WAS excellent. He hasn't been that Gary Harris in years
Gary Harris
Gary Harris
"bro thats what im saying, people act like this is the same Gary Harris as the 2016-18 one"
"PG actually played pretty well vs Denver. Gary Harris is a guard defender, not a wing defender. You don't really need to put an elite defender on PG, he's inconsistent to the point where you can get away with just putting length on him."
bruh we overrating the nuggs now. remember gary harris was huge in defending pg and hes gone. thrill is a shit defender
Gary Harris is literally why this Denver team got out of 1st round both times in last two seasons. We will see if AG can have that impact in the playoffs.
Lol no.   Gary Harris’ contract has negative value. That’s what the pick was for. Just to offload that contract. Meanwhile RJ Hampton is a real YMMV guy.  I thought the deal was fine for both sides. It actually taught me a lot about Gordon’s perceived value around the league that he was traded for so little
"gary harris was so bad for us for so long, the extra defense he brought was great but the dude bricked soooo many wide open 3's, couldn't slash like he used to, and straight up became an offensive liability. The spacing overall tonight looked incredible, aaron gordon is essentially just 3x better at what Harris does since we don't really have a rim protector right now, he's better at slashing, shooting, defending, and passing. Nuggets absolutely fleeced the magic and I cannot believe we got him for so cheap, especially since gary harris would've required a 1st to dump in the future"
"AG is going to be so huge for the Nuggets. His game fits seamlessly and replaces Gary Harris, who just could not stay healthy. Immediate upgrade."
"Gary Harris is always injured, especially this season where he pretty much hasn't played, also his offensive decline has been sad"
they gave up gary harris. It's an improvent for now cause harris was injured but come playoffs gordon is a fine replacement for the important role grant played but they're down an elite guard defender
Nah Gary Harris is excellent imo. His defence on Steph is great always
"Gary Harris, easily."
"Those are likely the consensus top 4. I’d also add Dejounte Murray, Gary Harris, Thybulle, Butler, PG, Kawhi, LeBron, Mikal Bridges, Derrick White and PBev. All of those guys aren’t as consistently solid, but for one game/possession I’d take all them over FVV for guard defense."
"Gary Harris still OWNS Donavin ""3-1 lead"" Mitchel"
"Gary ""1/9 in game 7"" Harris 😞"
"Gary ""allows 44 points and has 5 fouls and 2 points in game 6"" Harris"
Gary Harris OWNS Donavan Mitchel
"And the nuggets didn’t have Gary Harris, will Barton, and some of Jamal Murray."
i mean. Millsap was starting for the Nuggets last game. gary harris was in january. it's just a different team. not really comparable.  it's been 10 years since the last time rick carlisle won a playoff series.
Jokic and Gary Harris used to have that
Gary Harris🔒
Rose had that Gary Harris steal on Spida too bad they lost.  think LA gonna get #6
"35 yr old bron bron. Rest of the nuggies were arguably better than the lakers supporting cast. Jerami grant, mpj, Gary Harris, millsap, BOL BOL"
"Keep Lonzo, Ingram, and Hart then trade for a 3 and D sg (Gary Harris?) and a rim protecting big that can shoot (maybe Brook Lopez?)"
Gary Harris
He’s like you’re guys’ Gary Harris. When he’s healthy and you have important game he’s an absolute game changer. But for 75% of the season he’s injured or coming back from injuries.
The real Gary Harris replacement.
Don't forget Gary Harris missed half the series too. He came back i think game 5 and he was the best defender on the team that year.
Can you believe we traded Nurkic and Gary Harris for McDermott?
This is the problem with box score watchers like you. Comparing his rebounding ability to Colin Sexton and Gary Harris is troll behavior. Cleary you haven’t watched one game this season
You are sort of looking at it too narrow though. Not taking into account all the details.   Jokic this year has had the following:  -Gary Harris missing significant time while he was with the team  -A pretty big player turnover  -MPJ missing time due to Covid  -Monte Morris missing significant time with Hamstring injury then reaggravated it and missing probably til playoffs  -Murray coming in tired and battling minor injuries at the begging of the seasons   -Obviously ACL tear for Murray  -Barton Hamstring will miss significant time   And maybe something else Im missing.   Suns have so far been one of the healthiest teams in the league.
"Gary Harris rocking that Jameer Nelson, DJ Augustin magician #14"
"&gt; He is the living proof that hustle+BBIQ are way more important than size or athleticizm.  You're not wrong, but Gary Harris proved that to us a long time ago"
And Gary Harris (nice expiring contract next year) and a future 1st rounder.
"That’s Gary Harris, that’s quality"
Ah I think you meant to say : Gary “Gary ‘Gary Harris’ Harris” Harris
Gary “Gary ‘Carry Harris’ Harris” Harris
Hell yeah Gary Harris is carrying the Magic 😤
"We are starting this game with Watanabe, Birch and Johnson. No Lowry, OG, Gary Trent Junior, Boucher. We brought Harris from G-league to complete the bench. Raptors are a tanking team. The 3 point lead is an embarassment for clippers who are a contender this year"
"ppl here have no idea what the standard for ""non-starter"" really is. No one ever makes threads about like Hamidou Diallo or Gary Harris bad games because no one cares like they do for more famous players. Eric Bledsoe is starting next to Lonzo and he's hasn't played well much since joining the pels.  Lonzo is an NBA starter easily. His good games are great and posting his worst game of the year on reddit doesn't make all of his bad games like this one. He's fucking 23 years old, scored 33 the other day and triple doubled before that and now he has no shot at EVER being an all-star. ok then  knicks wouldn't start him over elf?"

"I thought Gary Harris was out, then he starts the 1Q on fire. Restrict those minutes, Magic!"
Myles turner is a very good shot blocker so he’s not average. Gary Harris is a good one tho.
Myles Turner or Gary Harris
"Perfect example for the flaw in your comment is the Denver Nuggets. Never tanked, never tried to tank, always competed after the George Karl blow up in 2013. They did things the right way, highest they drafted was 7, found great mid round and 2nd round value, savvy FA pickups, great coach, amazing player development, timely trades and extensions. Got better for 5 straight years.   Jerami Grant dashes for a bigger role, Gary Harris unexplainably loses his offensive game, Jamal Murray torn ACL, and that’s with getting unbelievably lucky enough to get two superstar potential players at 41 and 15 in Jokic and MPJ. Winning a championship is just hard. No one way will guarantee you get there, just gotta do your best and some times that means increasing your odds of getting a superstar. Any team could replicate the nuggets model but without the complete dumb luck of Jokic AND MPJ that’s a 6th seed at best."
"Fultz/Anthony/Okeke/Isaac/Bamba/WCJ is a nice core, plus vets in Ross, Gary Harris, Porter Jr that could be traded for more assets. I like what they have going on!"
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."

Shaq Harrison has been Gary Harris-lite and I loveee it.
https://hoopshype.com/player/gary-harris/salary/  Jesus he’s making 19mil this year and 20mil next year  I wasn’t even aware
why would the raptors trade siakam for gary harris and paul millsap? even if they get a few first round picks they're likely to be late 20s and the raptors might as well keep siakam.
&gt; you can't move that to a contender  Sure you can.  You don't think the Nuggets would have traded Gary Harris and Paul Milsap for Siakam? Or the Heat with the salary they sent out for Oladipo?
"These dudes are chucking on a team with a 7 man rotation and that banned John Wall from playing because they might win.  NBA is not like football... you aren't gonna get shut out and you need to get your points somewhere.   We see it all the time.. players usage goes up on a shit team and you think he's a lot better than he is-- aka Drummond, Jerami Grant, Gary Harris, etc.  A team would be foolish to pay Olynk wood  tate or porter based off numbers from chucking in garbage time."
Gary Harris x Torrey Craig hybrid

Reminds me a bit of the Gary Harris fouling KD gif.
Shaq “Shaq “Gary Harris” Harrison” Harrison
"same thing happened with the nuggets, when Gary Harris came back, Mitchell couldn’t get his shots and the rest of the team sorta just stood around and chuck contested 3s because the nuggets (like any playoff team) knew their tendencies and plays from the scouting report.  I think they get bounced 2nd round but I hope they prove me wrong cause I like seeing small markets succeed"
"&gt;Their chances weren’t even all that strong this year.  That's not really true. They made it to the WCF last year after beating the favorites and by the time the trade deadline had passed this year, this nuggets team was better than last year's. Jokic is playing at an MVP level,  bubble murray turned into just murray, MPJ isn't really a defensive liability anymore, Barton was healthy and playing great, facu is pissing off opposing teams and their fans with his defense, and we no longer have an offensive liability in gary harris in our starting 5. The only real downgrade seems to be Millsap, but he just needed a role change and has been crushing it in his more limited usage.  They certainly weren't favorites, but I don't think anyone who was really paying attention to the team would have been surprised if they made it to the finals."
You mean “Gary ‘Gary Harris’ harris” Harris
"I see no scenario where MPJ or Jamal Murray would not have ben involved in the Rockets demands. Giving up either of them would have been a bad decision considering Harden would have been a season rental. They certainly would have to give up numerous picks or multiple strong assets. In the Harden trade alone the Nets gave up Allen, Prince, LeVert, Kurucs, three first rounders, and four first round swaps.   If the Nuggets did not want to give up that many picks or both MPJ and Murray, then they would definitely have had to include their talented prospects such as RJ Hampton, Bol, or Dozier as well as someone like Gary Harris. If that scenario were to happen then we never would have gotten Gordon."
No Jamal Murray or Gary Harris makes things a lot easier for the Jazz though. Aaron Gordon simply doesn't exploit our weaknesses like those two do.
"My favorite was Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris."
gary harris all tank 1st team for sure
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
Gary Harris got traded to LA I guess
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris is my personal favorite
&gt; Fingers crossed he can be the best parts of Will Barton and Gary Harris  this is kind of insane.. but if he can develop he'll be good enough to be part of the main rotation with Jamal back.
Y’all definitely miss Gary Harris in that right. Mitchell is too fast for MPJ or Gordon imo.
Yo PJ finally getting the chance he always needed. Fingers crossed he can be the best parts of Will Barton and Gary Harris. These last 12 games are huge for him!
Doc is completely misusing his players having Gary Harris as his primary offensive option
You can’t steal this from Gary Harris.
Barton and Morris are two of the most underrated guards in the league. Aaron Gordon fits them perfectly (as did Gary Harris before him). Bucks are solid but it’s not like they’re the Nets. I prefer Jrue over Murray but they’re 100% comparable (sucks Murray got hurt only recently). Middleton is underrated but he’s more of a third option kind of guy.
"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."
"Yezzir. I think Cole is gonna be their future 6th man. Brings a lot of energy and offense. The magic could really have a fantastic foundation for their rebuild if the lottery goes their way.  PG: Fultz/Cole/MCW  SG: Jalen Green/ Gary Harris /RJ Hampton  SF: Jonathan Isaac/ Ross/ Bacon  PF: Chuma/ Draft pick  C: WCJ/ Bamba  Obviously not even close to being a contender, but a really nice foundation for their rebuild."
1 day. Nah since 2014 since i knew Gary Harris in highschool
Gary Harris was straight ass the two games he played.
"Aggression aside, simply staying in front of your man to keep him from getting downhill is huge.  For example, Torrey Craig got lauded as a defensive guy even though he was honestly pretty medium. He gave a ton of effort so Malone loved him and played him a ton (see: facu). But he also gambled a ton and played really aggressively. When that isn’t really what we need with our defensive scheme. Gary Harris, on the other hand, was really great at just simply staying in front of his man (when he was healthy anyway). He didn’t take many risks but he also rarely made many mistakes.  Now perhaps simmons and thybulle get the best of both worlds with embiid behind them and they can opportunistically take some chances, but I think given the choice between:  * above average (or elite) perimeter defenders who can stay in front of their man with an average rim protector  vs   * average perimeter defenders with an above average (or elite) rim protector  I think I’d take the first one. Unfortunately for Denver, we have been struggling with having average at both lol. I think Philly is above average to elite at both. But I think I’d rather limit the penetration in the first place rather than try to deal with it at the rim where guys score pretty efficiently regardless of who is there.  Somewhat related question - who do you think is more impactful for your defense between simmons and embiid? Or are their roles too intertwined to really make a distinction? Who do you think is more talented in a vacuum? I’m genuinely asking our of curiosity, not because I’m trying to set up a “gotcha” or anything re: the DPOY or MVP, though I do think having two standout guys can sometimes hurt each other (like Steph and KD in the mvp race)."
"Nuggets were without Barton. And, Gary Harris missed the first 5 games of that series. Pretty important players for Denver."
"As much as I love Gary Harris, I'm really glad we got off his contract."
The best players I've ever seen guard Booker are him and Gary Harris
Gary Harris +1 in his 26 minutes  I see what you did there Orlando
"Toronto got GTJ which is a W  Orlando got Gary Harris,RJ Hampton,Wendell Carter and 3 picks which is a nice haul"
This the year with that insane nuggets game where Gary Harris hit that winner?
"Bol ""Gary Harris"" Bol"
Orlando is a massively different team since last time. A big part of that was both AG and one of the few legit eastern centers in vuc. No way do Gary Harris and OPJ make up for that
Gary Harris and Chuma Okeke for co-dpoy’s
"Not before the season but - Gary Harris. The guy used to clamp up elite stars like Dame, Curry, Mitchell."
"Reminds me of how sad all the nuggets guys were when Gary Harris got shipped off. I mean, all those years of forming a brotherhood just to lose one does hurt."
"Orlando fans, how is Gary Harris doing?"
"A couple of years ago, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray seemed like that"
"&gt;Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...? Man   You just listed quite a few terrific players. Would be by far the best best in the league"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
"You want a 3&amp;D like Eric Gordon or Gary Harris at the 2. Wall starting PG for defense . It'd be a good lineup , KAT alone can damn near carry the offense and you have enough defenders out there"
"Hmm.. actually John Wall + Eric Gordon + Jerami Grant + Christian Wood + KAT is a very solid starting 5 with plenty of athleticism, shooting &amp; versatility. DLo, Terrance Ross, Ant Edwards, Malik Beasley coming off the bench gunning threes.. or Gary Harris and Otto Porter if they're healthy in this scenario  Idk about championship but it'd be a pretty nasty team in the East. Probably 4th seed ahead of Atl and behind Phi/Bkn/Mil"
"At least you got a first from us for him. You drafted Jusuf Nurkić and traded him(with Gary Harris) for Doug McDermott. You then traded McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second(Mitchell Robinson) for Joffrey Lauvergne, Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne. All those guys left the team that offseason."
"It may seem like Jokic has the team crafted around him because he’s miles ahead as a playmaker and passer, but the Nugs roster has a lot of flaws. The best defenders Jokic has played with before AG were a 34 year old millsap and a perennially injured Gary Harris.   Embiid is an ISO guy teams aren’t crafted around guys like that. You’re only saying Embiid doesn’t have the team crafted around him because Ben Simmons cannot shoot and refuses to."
"[LeBron, PG and Kyrie together on the Cavs in 2017](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cavs-trade-for-paul-george-fell-apart-2017-7)  &gt; According to a report from ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne, Dave McMenamin, and Brian Windhorst, the Cavs, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers had agreed to a trade that would have sent Kevin Love to the Nuggets, Nuggets guard Gary Harris and the 2017 13th overall pick to the Pacers, and George to the Cavs. However, suddenly, Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard texted the Cavs that he was backing out, and the deal fell apart. According to ESPN, the deal lives in “infamy” within the Cavs  Does Kyrie still want to leave if this trade happened?   Does LeBron stay in Cleveland?  Could the Cavs have beaten the 2018 Warriors?  How does adding Kevin Love affect the trajectory of the Nuggets?"

Gary Harris as well
Half Gary  Half Harris  100% Handsome
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
Gary Harris went from a quality 17 ppg to not even 10 ppg
I know he broke his wrist or something but the Jazz still had an all star back court while the Nuggets went without their two best wing defenders they didn’t even come back until Gary Harris returned
Wdym his team was without two of their beat wing defenders in Gary Harris and Will Barton playing Donovan Mitchell
"You really compared 22-year-old Jamal to the current one? And, Dame was atrocious that series, what are you talking about? Gary Harris was locking him up. CJ and Rodney Hood won that series."
Clarkson bbiq is extremely low.   Gary Harris made him a non factor last year
I’m a casual for thinking that Devin Booker was going to be better than Gary Harris??? Bruh… shut your fucking mouth there’s shit coming out of it
"Don’t think so, unless it was OG Gary Harris when he was actually good. Definitely not modern negative asset Gary Harris"
WAIT HOLD THE PHONE ARENT YOU THE GUY WHO ARGUED WITH ME THAT GARY HARRIS CONTRIBUTES MORE TO WINNING BASKETBALL THAN DEVIN BOOKER LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Because they're an average at best defensive team 3 years running who've lost Torrey and Gary Harris since the last time we saw them unable to get stops in the postseason? .
We needed pj Dozier/Gary Harris  One is injured the other traded
I mean we had that with PJ Dozier and Gary Harris. Traded Gary away and Dozier was injured. Otherwise we would've made it more competitive
Is Aaron Gordon any good? I watched them play a lot with him this year and expected a lot more. Id rather have kept Gary Harris and RJ Hampton than whatever he provided
"Gary Harris, RJ Hampton (a rookie), and a draft pick I believe.   I mean, Gordon is probably a good piece when we have all the other players (Murray, Dozier, Morris, Barton), but he is definitely not a go-to scoring 3rd option."
AG is at least a tall Gary Harris
If I’m the Nuggets...I kinda want Gary Harris back. That AG trade was a mistake imo.
"Gary Harris is a better player than AG as well, I would rather have him"
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
I can't believe they traded a young Gary Harris for Aaron Gordon.  HUGE L
"Honestly, Gary Harris could be really useful in these situations, a good 3&amp;D player"
Dude when the fuck was Gary Harris traded lmaoo I thought he was just out for the season
The Nuggets really should’ve kept Gary Harris
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
Gary Harris&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"That's obviously a big factor, but you want to just give up and not do anything about it? It was fine when Gary Harris was there and Shaq Harrison is as good as him defensively"
Lol it was gary harris I was thinking of. Sucks that barton is on minutes and murry is injured would of been fun to see murry and booker go at it with jokic and ayton battling
"The Nuggets really traded Gary Harris, RJ Hampton, and a 1st round pick for Aaron Gordon."
dont really remember Gary Harris being anything above average or outstandingly good in the playoffs last year? I do remember him shooting inconsistently tho
I feel like rj Hampton and Gary Harris would be helpful rn. Both good defenders and rj can be a shot creator and play-make a bit
"Gary Harris was a big loss but they’ve also got Murray, Dozier, and Barton all out. Probably their 3 best guard defenders"
Good thing they have one of the few Booker stoppers in Gary Harris… wait
"Low key, Gary Harris was kind of a significant loss for Denver's defense.   I still really wonder wtf happened to his shooting though..."
Gary Harris was way better
he’s a better defender who is also less injury prone than Gary Harris
At least Gary Harris could be a force on defense. The one time Connelly makes a move and it hurts us lol
"I think it would be a long and competitive series with murray but almost solely because the nuggets offense would get much better. the nuggets have struggled with containing spread pick and roll in the playoffs before (jazz series before gary harris came back was particularly bad, denver had all those other guys you mentioned back then and it didn't really matter cause they aren't really ""get over screens"" at all cost type defenders)."
"Who’s the best out of Gary Harris, THJ, and Fourier? They’re basically the same tier right? Maybe TBJ if I have to choose."
No way Fornier gets Gary Harris money 🤷🏽‍♂️
"We also acquired Gary Harris (who used to be good, I promise), Jusuf Nurkic and Nikola Jokic in the same draft.   We traded McDermott for Harris and Nurkic"
They can have Dwayne Bacon and Gary Harris
"Nuggets are missing Gary Harris right now.  He was a great defender and gave Booker problems. Right now, no guard on Denver's roster can guard Paul/Booker. I'm pretty sure they just see Campazzo/Rivers and start salivating. AG is arguably their best wing defender, but he's kind of a mess on the other end when Jokic is on the floor since he can't reliably shoot the 3. if you want spacing, you have MPJ, but he's a liability on defense so there's that.  I think Barton is gonna be the x factor. If he can get healthy and play 30+ good minutes, things can get interesting."
Gary 'Gary Harris' Harris
"Well they need Murray back and why the hell did they get rid of Harris? Gary was their shotmaker and good defender, but instead they went out and got...Austin Rivers?!? Denver is a PG away from taking it all, sorry but I still thing Jamal should slide over to SG, he just shoots way too much and doesnt get anyone else involved, Joker has to do the PG duties."
"I wouldnt say a Suns killer, I mean Denver won in OT, 2OT and lost once in regulation. Id say if everyone healthy Suns are pretty even, I mean one of those games Gary Harris won it for ya'll, but got rid of a shooter for ...Austin Rivers?!?!"
Why did the Nuggets trade Gary Harris again?
"Yeah, Denver used to have our number. Jamal would go off and Gary Harris played great D on Booker"
"**Vanilla media options**  Cleveland: Love  Dallas: KP  **Tankers who could collect picks**  Orlando has the contracts to make it happen (Gary Harris)  Houston for Wall and picks. They'd likely have to eat TT's deal.   **Have the big contracts, questionable strategic move...**   NOLA - Adams, Bledsoe, (Lonzo S&amp;T?)  Clippers have the contracts (Bev, Morris, Zubac, Kennard)  Twolves have Rubio Beasley, and of course, D'Lo   **Cap room to do anything**  Spurs, Knicks, Detroit, OKC, Raps (if Lowry walks)."
"The smart move would be to take tangible talent and deal with known quantities than roll the dice and pray to god the Nets are run by incompetent clowns and somehow end up tanking when every shred of evidence from the past 5 years says otherwise. Simmons can easily be flipped for young talent and more picks. Teams around the league would salivate for him. He fits Wolves, Nuggets and Bulls like a glove. That's valuable draft compensation from Minny or young talent like MPJ, picks and Gary Harris or more picks from Bulls.   Most of the arguments for the Nets deal involve praying that those picks end up being lottery. No logic no reason.   r/NBA has this opinion of Ben as some mediocre talent with a fixed ceiling. There's a reason why in the 4 years he's been in the league he's literally never been on the trade block except when an MVP candidate was available. Think about that for a second."
Bulls picked Dougie. We traded that pick for Nurkic and Gary Harris
"$24m is a fucking bargain for a guy who still the best help defender in the league, one of the best overall defenders in the league, a guy who isn't just a great individual defender but tells his whole team where to be, calls out sets and coverages, etc.   It's a fucking bargain when that guy is also one of the best passing/play-making bigs in the league, not that far from LeBron in assist percentage (i.e. he's the guy racking up most of the assists while on the floor, helped by some Curry gravity of course).   Would you rather be paying...  $27.5m for Al Horford?  $31m for Kevin Love?  $28.5m for Otto Porter?  $19.2 for Gary Harris?  $36.6m for Blake Griffin (his salary this season before being bought out)  $15m for Andre Iguodala?  $17m for Rickey Rubio?  $24m for LMA, his salary before his heart issues forced him into early retirement?  Here, I'll even get controversial, is Russell Westbrook at $41m really more valuable than Draymond at $24m?  Draymond's extension was 100% team friendly."
"Not the most iconic or well known but Count Monte Assist/TO is the coolest.   For the Nuggets fanbase Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris is the most iconic"
"&gt;As if younger Jokic was taking teams to the 3rd seed.  22 year old Jokic lead the Nuggets to 46 wins, 2 games out of the 3rd seed in 2018. Gary Harris missed 15 games, Millsap missed 44 games, Murray was 20 years old and in his 2nd year.   23 year old Jokic lead the Nuggets to 54 wins and the 2 seed. Gary Harris missed 25 games, Barton missed 39. Iirc Nuggets players missed the most games due to injury in the league that year.   24 year old Jokic lead the Nuggets to a 52 win equivalent and the 3rd seed. Barton missed 15 games, Murray missed 14 games, Harris missed 17.   Jokic is a far better floor raiser than AD has ever been. Even at 22/23 years old."
He did it on the Gary Harris pod and it was so fucking cringe
Gary Harris has only gotten worse in the last few years
"It's unsustainable. They have to fix the buyout system, or guys aren't even going to make trade demands. Guys like Gary Harris or Davis Bertans are just going to get a contract, demand a buyout right after, and get paid by small market teams for the next 3 years to play on a minimum deal for LA or New York.   They should force the team that signs them to reimburse the buyout team for their salary. Or add it to their luxury tax total."
"Other than Jokic going off I'm not sure. The suns can deal with the problems denver creates by putting Ayton on Jokic but Denver will have a much harder time dealing with these constant variations of high pick and rolls with the suns guards.   Denver has had this issue for a while and their solution before was get Gary Harris back lol, use more wing help and give up open 3s. they tried that with leaving crowder in corner in the 4th and there was one shot where there was no one within 10 feet of him"
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
gary harris??
"the gary harris effect, i miss him :'("
This series could be the one where Denver really misses Gary Harris (for defending Booker).
"Gary Harris being out is the main reason Mitchell exploded early in the series. When he came back in game 5, Mitchell came back down to earth. Or do you also blame Gobert for Murray averaging ""like 50ppg"" last year?"
"I'd love to see Gary succeed as well and I feel the Orlando situation is really not a good fit for him, but going back to Denver would not be a step up for his career. Playing second/third fiddle along with Dame and Nurk could be great for him, I feel.   On the Morris side yeah, he may be short, but he's got long ass arms and has good instincts on that end. He's definitely not a starter over Murray, but is still amazing in a supportive starting role/bench mob leader for this Nuggets squad. At this point I'd prefer his fit on the Nuggets over the fit that Harris would've had right now"
Jokic and Gary Harris was never a pnr combo. Gary always knew when to cut and when jokic would get him the ball
Is he even better than RJ Hampton Gary harris and Cole Anthony? He would be on the bench here.
"&gt;Gordon was avaliable for a first round pick and young player like Garry Harris.  He was available for a first round pick, a young player AND a player like Gary Harris. RJ was at the center of that trade on our end"
To Magic for Wcj/mo Bamba +Gary harris
"A superstar in Tatum... From the Brooklyn trade. Along with Brown. They wasted what ended up being an 8th pick on Kyrie but even the 2014 pick (17th, James Young) you can’t reasonably say they failed to take advantage of because picks 17-24 were trash (depending how much you value that one year Gary Harris was really good before his body fell apart), Capela at 25 is the next pick worth mentioning as an actual difference maker.  What they failed to do was basically everything else. Horford dipped for nothing right after they started being genuinely competitive. Hayward snapped in half five minutes in. Kyrie really Kyrie’d it up. They’ve consistently failed to find solid bench contributors for vet mins or exceptions. Their own picks have been pretty hit and miss.  The Nets trade though, Tatum and Brown are about as good as you could have hoped for."
Nah Nuggets will make this a series. CP still isn't 100% but Nuggets no longer having Gary Harris is a blessing for Booker.
They also had Gary Harris who for some reason is one of the best in the NBA at slowing down Booker. I was happy when he was traded
"The nuggets have made the absolute most of their situation at almost every turn, but looking back on it there has been a ton of luck too. Like, why was Austin Rivers available in April? Plenty of other playoffs teams could have used him before the nuggets.  Not trading Gary Harris for Kevin Love in 2017 because the third-team Pacers got cold feet is another great stroke of luck. Grant leaving turned into the nuggets getting a much better fit In AG. Never getting a huge offer for Jokic when the nuggets were desperate for a star and a post-season appearance in 2014-2017 arguably forced the franchise to retain its best player ever when his value was less certain. Not to mention losing to the Wolves in the last game of 2018 to miss the playoffs but getting MPJ because of it. It’s just been a great streak for the nuggets both management-wise and luck-wise. The kind of serendipity that has to end in a championship, I hope."
"Barton also Dozier is out, where’s Gary Harris? Did he get traded?"
"So, you agree Mitchell was ""the best player in the league"" for 5 games untill Gary Harris came back? I mean I'd rather win the series but, to each his own. Hang it in the rafters."
It's pretty easy to put up stats going up against G-league players. Shame he never puts up these stats against us when we're healthy.   Gary Harris used to clamp him up every time and so did PJ.
"I agree, Shamet isn't very good, but the fact that he and Redick had career years at 20 and 35 years old shows you how three point specialists can flourish next to Jo and Ben.    Guys making less who could fill the role: Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, VanVleet, Buddy, Clarkson, Rozier, Gary Trent.  All players who takes at least 2.5x as many threes as Harris.  Brogdon was another guy who moved and signed for a lot less than Harris got who I think would make the team better.  They would look awesome as sixers and we could probably have two of them for what it took to get and resign Harris.  It's hard to say exactly what was available so I can't just say they should have signed Kawhi, Kyrie or KD but the sixers took themselves out of the running for a superstar by trading for the 58th best player."
"the fact of the matter is all trades in all sports are mostly looked at with hindsight   Richardson was ideally a great piece to add to a Luka team, but he hasn't been it  I saw it with us. We waited on Gary Harris for years because the ideal version of him as a lockdown perimeter defender, guard, and 3pt shooter was a perfect fit. He never got back to that and it made us very, very sad."
"Then you find a better bench point guard.  Or try to get a secondary playmaker like Aaron Gordon.  Nuggets were able to get that deal done despite the fact Gary Harris sucks. At some point, Olshey should've swallowed the bitter pill and moved on from CJ when his value was high.  You can't keep saying Blazers are failing Dame but then argue against moving CJ."
"Without Gary Harris and PJ Dozier, we'd let Payton Pritchard average 40 on us. Mitchell was doing the same last year until Gary came back."
Bucks have some dumb ones. Trading (still very young but promising) Tobias Harris and scraps for JJ Reddick who didn't want to be in Milwaukee and dipped after half a year. Trading Ray Allen for half a year of old Gary Payton. Paying Miles Plumlee a 4 year/$52 million dollar deal back in 2016. Amazing they were able to dump that contract later on though. There's plenty more from the era where they wanted to always fight for the 8 seed.
If the Nuggets didnt trade Gary Harris imo this series wouldve been over already.
You forget that Gary Harris is a hair worse at scoring but head and shoulders above book in every other aspect of the game
Gary Harris  Edit: Didn't see you said by how they play. Probably Zion and Curry in that case.
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it’s a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line…  Put the ball in Tyler Herro’s hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‘Gary Harris’ guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it’s the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He’s not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‘5 guys who average 15 a game’ blueprint has never worked"
"MPJ improved a lot but he's struggling with consistency, especially now in the playoffs, which is perfectly understandable considering his age. But even if he played better, I wish that would have been enough for us to truly be better than last year.   Jerami Grant is an excellent two-way player and we couldn't really find a replacement for him. Gordon is good on defence but sometimes invisible on offence. Jamychal Green is okay as a backup but nothing more. Milsap is one year older and he can give you a quarter of good basketball every like five games but that's it.  People forget how important Gary Harris was last year. Him coming back from injury turned that series vs Jazz. Murray balled out but we actually lost one of those games where he scored 50 and then won the last two with Harris. Craig was great on defence as well and our replacements for him are PJ Dozier (injured) and Zeke Nnaji (not playing).  Plumlee had his issues (AD buzzer beater flashback) but he was a solid backup big overall and we couldn't find a replacement for him. Javale isn't playing much and we usually go with Green at five which isn't working that well.  Campazzo is a positive but he's not much of a scorer and we need scoring badly. He would be a backup with Murray healthy but our bench is terrible at scoring anyways, so he wouldn't contribute much on that end anyway. Morris is playing worse than last year. And yeah, Barton is injured again although he might come back in the next few games."
Groin and hip injuries are so easy to reaggravate and linger. Gary Harris has battled it for years and Dozier is seemingly done for the season. Even if mild I think he’s done for the series
"Luke Kennard is only guaranteed  40 mil over then next 3 years. Buddy Hield at 24 mil, Oladipo at 21 mil, and Gary Harris at 19 mil are guys with larger contracts. Give me Gary Harris on this one."
"KP has Magic written all over him. So maybe Gary Harris, Wendell Carter Jr, and filler."
"I'm a Magic Fan, so i hope it doesn't  happen but they would be stupid enough to trade for him. Probably have to Gary Harris and either Bamba or WCJ."
Moach couldn’t be any worse than Gary Harris last year and we made the wcf so I think we could be decent
Agreed. The Nuggets are a development powerhouse. MPJ. Murray Jokic! Even players like Gary Harris looked fantastic before injuries. and Malik Beasley is a good player
I love how you put our worst player in the starting lineup with Bacon.  Lol we absolutely would contend with LeBron.  What we lack is a superstar to set everyone up.  Ross would be better with Lebron.  Gary Harris would.  Look at the 2018 Cavs.  Our roster is comparable to that roster if not slightly more talented.
"Gary Harris being drafted into a rebuild, then being traded at their peak is pretty unlucky. I feel like any top prospect drafted by the Kings must feel pretty unlucky."
"Main reason he struggled in 2019?  GARY ""GARY HARRIS"" HARRIS.  Fuck we miss him so much"
&gt; Denver entered the season with one of the deeper guard rotations in the NBA. &gt;  &gt; PG: Jamal Murray / Monte Morris / Facu Campazzo / Markus Howard &gt;  &gt; SG: Gary Harris / Will Barton / PJ Dozier / RJ Hampton  Dude read even just the first few sentences
"I mean I think you’re being disingenuous if you say that Gary Harris and KCP can do what Ben can do while also saying that Capela can “maybe” do what Gobert can do. If players like KCP are the bar for perimeter defence, guys like Derrick Favours, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Nurkic, Draymond, Poeltl , Gifford, Robin Lopez, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen + more should all count as “acceptable” defensive anchors"
"So... Gary Harris was the reason for our peak? I love Gary to death, but on a team with Jokic, MPJ, and Murray... giving up Gary Harris is the reason we've past our peak?"
"Harris is mentioned on the front page twice. We know about him, well, it's Tobias and Shaq - and then a user has Gary Harris flair. So, yeah, we all know about this Harris character...."
Gary Harris &amp; RJ Hampton. And Melo.
Gary Harris killing it shoutout to Marv
"Also, Chicago traded 16 and 19 (Nurkic and Gary Harris) for 11 (Doug McDermott) and a late 2nd. So yeah, 12-14 sounds like a good guess"
Unless Westbrook is in town. As an OKC fan in Colorado I went to every OKC game I could and I've seen at least 3 grown men get kicked out during games going overboard yelling shit at Russ (or the one time a fan rushed the court after a Gary Harris game winner and screamed in Russ's face; fan was then banned)
"2021 1st rd Bulls pick, Gary Harris, 2023 Chi 1st, 2025 Den 1st, Orlando 2022 1st top 4 protected, Mo Bamba"
Yeah when we had Gary Harris to put on Dame it needed to be CJ that stepped up
"Just to go against the grain I'd say the Raptors or Hornets.    Raptors have a solid young talent base and could maybe use Lowry to land another asset or young piece. They need to find another star to complement Siakam but the base of FVV, OG, Gary Trent, is solid plus young guys like Flynn, Boucher (not super young in reality but still NBA young), Gillespie, Watanabe and even Jalen Harris flashed a little bit at the end of the year plus a top 10 pick. Also their coach is top notch.   Hornets have great young players and IF Hayward is healthy a very solid veteran wing (I know it's a huge IF). Need to upgrade at the center position and maybe get some more shooting but they're super bright and their division seems like one of the weaker ones"
I guess I could’ve said Gary Harris because he’s making like 20 million. He only has one year left on his deal though
Gary Harris
They would have been better off keeping Gary Harris.
Are you referring to the Nurkic+Gary Harris for McDermott swap?  In that case the 11th pick wound up being the worst player of the three lol
"My heart hurt for Timberwolves fans reading through this.  Also, I nearly sobbed when someone predicted Gary Harris would be a top 5 shooting guard :("
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
"I forgot about Dozier completely, I guess that's why they had to go after Rivers.  I feel like Barton has always been out and they're use to playing without him. But agreed they were definitely short handed.   I was pretty surprised they got by without a 3 and D wing. They lost Gary Harris , Torrey Craig, and Jerami Grant! I've never considered Aaron Gordon to be a 3 and D wing but he did a good job on defense in the playoffs."
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."
Oh for fucks’ sake. You want to overpay Lonzo and have him turn out to be the new Gary Harris/Otto Porter Jr. ? Don’t double down on an obviously bad move.
"Seriously nobody has mentioned the Joker? Gary Harris is not a lifer, he was traded. Who made this half assed list..."
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
"5+8+Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris."
We had Gary “Gary Harris” Harris for awhile.
Yes I think he will opt in and be traded along with Kuzma and their pick to the Orlando Magic for TRoss and Gary Harris so we can have Kuzma in Orlando memes
Kuzma + Harrell + 1st for Gary Harris + TRoss who says no
"Unless they’re willing to deal Klay, Steph, or Draymond (which I’m sure they’re not), the warriors should be looking more for a Gary Harris than a Bradley Beal"
"Just the fact that they have 2 top 8 picks going into this year is enough for me to not declare them the bleakest future. To me, bleak future means the team is stuck in late lottery purgatory, too good to bottom out for a top pick, not good enough to make actual noise in the playoffs, and not having any stars/potential stars they can trade for a massive haul to kickstart a rebuild. Magic arent there. They're committing to a hard rebuild and just 2 top 8 picks to start a rebuild with is the exact type of thing teams with actual bleak futures wish they had.  Sure the current young players on the roster might be underwhelming but the Magic have plenty of time left before we declare them a bleak future. Like I said they have 2 top 8 picks this year and so many means of continuing to build off of that (more than likely will have another top 10 pick next year). They also have another Chicago 1st and Denver 1st (albeit a few years down the line). They have Gary Harris on an expiring who they can move for assets any time between now and the deadline (and playoff teams will definitely be interested). Ross also can be of interest to playoff teams and they can get stuff for him. Isaac has his injury concerns but we know he's legit. Fultz has his concerns as well but he still has potential (and if they get a coach like Atkinson I think he'll bring the most out of him, however much that may be). Cole Anthony showed some signs as a rookie. Wendell Carter is still a decent young piece with potential.  Hard to call their future bleak now. Obviously it depends how they use their assets and how their young players develop but as of now if I'm a Magic fan I'm feeling pretty good about the future outlook of the team."
"Yeah, Jrue, Gary Harris, and now Beverly are probably the best Booker defenders I think I've seen. Thybulle too be that was only like 10 minutes"
"He did get carried by CJ and others in 2019 so, Dame does know that feeling lmao. Man shot 38 % from the field getting clamped by Gary Harris."
A bit yeah.   Obviously a bucket but his basketball IQ is very low which makes him predictable for elite defenders to stop  Watch Gary Harris defence on him in the bubble
"Dang, I guess they won’t take Michael Carter Williams and Gary Harris for him then….."
Then you haven't seen Gary Harris
"Nah, he's a really good defender lol. Booker shot 38% in the Clippers series, and the majority of that was off the back of Beverly's defense. Gary Harris straight up isn't better than him, and Kris Dunn is hard to rate atm."
Gary Harris would’ve made All-Defence in 2019 but he missed like 20 games.
Gary Harris no doubt
"I am a fan of the irreverent one like Gary ""Garry Harris"" Harris. Or, Sauce Castillo for stauskas  Edit: James ""literally Jimmy"" Butler"
"Having Murray back doesn’t help the Nuggets defense. I said it at the start of the year, but losing Grant and Craig really weakened their defense, and while Aaron Gordon helps make up the difference, they lost another great perimeter defender in Gary Harris. They’ve gotta sure up that end of the floor before I could hypothetically say they beat the Suns healthy"
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
"One of them needs to improve defensively imo (most likely will be Jokic as he's already underrated there imo). Gordon was an upgrade from Harris overall, but I think Denver still would benefit from a Gary Harris type player in the starting lineup instead of Barton."
"Gary Harris is/was a salary dump. I doubt he has any positive trade value. Hopefully, he fixes that."
Kemba is way better than Gary Harris 😭
Sure I have... The fact is they didn't make the trade. If anything you're not offering facts just speculation.  Barnes is probably worth a 2nd or two like Fournier maybe he's worth more if they are willing to take back a Gary Harris style bad contract.
"He also averaged 11 points in Orlando. Dude's a Rookie who had a lot of upside prior to the draft, give him time.   And as I mentioned above, Gary Harris can totally be flipped for a first - he's an expiring 20M contract on a rebuilding Magic team. If some team is desperate to get off a bad contract they can package a first along with it. Look at what Boston did with Kemba Walker."
"Gordon has more value to Denver than Barnes would. Gordon's not the star Orlando needed him to be and he fits that established role of a swiss-army knife guy for the Nuggets. He doesn't need be the third guy when you have Jokic, Murray and MPJ.   In that sense you can almost say he's overpaid for what he does especially since he's been a streaky 3-point shooter for his whole career (big wings will always get paid though).   And Gary Harris can totally be flipped for a first - he's an expiring 20M contract on a rebuilding Magic team. If some team is desperate to get off a bad contract they can package a first along with it. Look at what Boston did with Kemba Walker."
Nobody is giving a first for Gary Harris and RJ literally averaged 2 points on 41% shooting in Denver lol  Also Gordon wanted out and the Magic didn't want him anymore so they could blow it up. The Kings want to keep Barnes thats why the Celtics didn't get him
Yeah but I think Gordon still has more value than Barnes does. And Gary Harris can’t get flipped for a first
"Take Aaron Gordon as an example for the going rate of those style of players - RJ Hampton (a rookie, so essentially a FRP), a future first and Gary Harris (expiring who can potentially be flipped into another FRP).   Gordon's a better defender but Barnes is a better scorer."
"I think a championship contender was an ambitious ask honestly. After Kyrie left they were due for a youth movement imho. Getting to another conference finals after he left was nothing short of astounding  Usually teams that need space can trade their crap money with picks to tanking teams and the Celtics were really clear candidates for that with 2 stars under 25. They didnt have a plan for their draft picks and they were a step slow in assessing if they could really win a title, which is entirely fine but with some of the older guys on the roster you wonder if they could have been in the market for some more young rotation level giards/wings that they were really hurting for this year like Gary Harris, Norman Powell, Bryn Forbes, Duncan Robinson. Those type of guys could have really helped realign the franchise on Tatum/Brown's timeline. And they really didn't have a clue what they wanted with their picks anyways."
"Perfect:   * Sign Kenny Atkinson or MDA.   * Somehow finagle a first for TRoss or Gary Harris.   * Hit on both the #5 and #8 picks or trade up to get Jalen Green.  * Isaac and Markelle come back earlier than expected and are 100%.  * Mo uses his first actual offseason well and comes back looking like Dwight.  Realistic:   * We sign Becky Hammon or Stotts.  * We hit on one of #5 &amp; #8.  * Isaac comes back in late Nov - early December, and Markelle comes back in January.  * Mo comes back better but still comes off the bench for WCJ  Worst case:   * We hit on neither of the picks,  * Isaac doesn't come back til after All-Star, Markelle misses the season. * Mo comes back the same or worse."
We already have Gary Harris who plays a similar role. I like him as a player though.
"&gt; Tbf Saddiq Bey looks way better than your typical #19 pick  actually not as it turns out lmfao. 19 is the most loaded non lotto pick spot this decade somehow. Huerter, Collins, Tobias and Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley all 19th overall lmao.  Bey is a gem though, Detroit has a bright future."
Gary Harris Task Force Reporting For Duty
"Tbf it was Bey and he was literally a first team rookie. Hell half the last 19th picks in the last decade are prolly better picks than bagley. Huerter, Collins, Tobias Harris, Gary Harris, malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley."
"The Jalen Brunson - Luke Ridnour comparison is a random one but it seems very accurate to me.  The Donovan Mitchell pre-draft comparisons (Avery Bradley, Gary Harris, etc) look silly because we now know how good he is offensively as a ball handler and pull up shooter.  Generally most 3 and D prospects have pretty accurate comparisons. OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, etc. are pretty much who we thought they'd be in terms of play style."
"Jokic has been terriffic in the playoffs for three straight years, putting up numbers much closer to this MVP season than those regular seasons  2019: 25.1/13.0/8.4 on 51/39/85  2020: 24.4/9.8/5.7 on 52/43/84 - injured Will Barton/Gary Harris - defeated Championship Contender Clippers  2021: 29.8/11.6/5.0 on 51/38/84 - injured Jamal Murray/Will Barton  I think that he's been near (not at) this level for longer, but just has been the type to really crank it up in the postseason."
Orlando Magic starting lineup:  Cole Anthony -  Gary Harris -  Dwayne Bacon - Moritz Wagner - Mo Bamba   Team Serbia starting lineup:  Stefan Jović - Bogdan Bogdanović - Nemanja Bjelica - Nikola Jokić - Boban Marjanović  Why exactly do people think Orlando could beat Serbia?
Barton and PJ are wings? Just say you've never watched Denver play and move on. Barton hasn't played wing since Gary Harris left and PJ is our backup 2.
"Also - Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris, Desmond Bane, and Trey Lyles. Carsen Edwards isn't from Indiana."
"Hayward, Eric Gordon, Darius Garland, Gary Harris, Teague, Conley, George Hill are the notable current ones that come to mind"
"I think Bev will stay on Book, he seems to bother him more than anyone else in the NBA aside from Gary Harris/Matisse Thybulle"
"Isaac.  Fultz,  Cole Anthony is pretty good.  Terrence Ross.  Gary Harris is the main defensive reason Denver beat Utah in the bubble.  Wendell Carter JR so yeah, we aren’t the least talented team in the NBA.  Teams may have a better top player than us like the Kings or the Rockets or Pistons.  But overall I’d take our team as a whole over them."
"What about 5, 8, and Gary Harris for 3 and KLove? Cavs get 2 picks and an expiring for Loves big ass contract"
"Look at from this perspective.  Hampton was a late 1st rounder on a team that has  constantly found gems late in the draft over the last few years.   They found this year's MVP in the 2nd Round of a Draft that the ""experts"" say was a top heavy class.  Their GM's 2 biggest draft night mistakes gave the Jazz their best 2 players &amp; made them into an contender.  When Orlando made the deal to send Aaron Gordon to Denver, it was not about Gary Harris (who's a FA after next year) or the 1st round pick that will likely be at in the 20-30 range, it was about Hampton. That guy is going to be a big part of the Magic's rebuild."
"&gt; Because my original point was about building a title contender and what players are capable of beingthe best player... like Kawhi in 2019. You're literally not following the thread of what I've said. Nobody said those dudes suck or that will better health yall aren't a playoff team. Are you saying losing in the second round is noteworthy? The Sixers will be ecstatic to find that out.  I followed the thread of what you are saying, I disagree with trading Siakam so you can roll the dice and maybe get a player as good as him in the future especially when any picks we get in return for him will most likely be late lottery or protected firsts. It isn't something we've done with our current front office regime and it was a success in the end. And if we trade Siakam for what would amount of some meh first-rounders might as well trade everyone not named OG, Flynn and Green as well and just go into an extended rebuild rather than attempting a retool. It also isn't that likely that we'd get a player better than Siakam with any mid to late first-rounders we'd get from trading him.  Losing in Game 7 of the second round after your All-Star + All-NBA player goes into a terrible uncharacteristic slump after not touching a ball during lockdown in Toronto in a Disney World bubble during a pandemic is the tiniest bit different than the Sixers losing in game 7 of the second round after Embiid gets injured again and Ben Simmons does a playoff Ben Simmons thing.  &gt; are you trying to win a title or just not be in the lottery because that core is not the former and you know it. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years.  A core with playable centres that had the 2nd best record in the league last year. That's beyond just ""not be in the lottery"". Re-tooling by looking to rectify a weakness that killed us this year (no centres), putting whichever Jalen we draft through the famed Raptors development program and continuing to develop our young guys on top of a core that outside of a pandemic and Disney World bubble was an elite team &gt;&gt;&gt; blowing it up cause apparently 27 is too old.  Who would we have to pay in the next few years? Siakam and FVV are locked in until 2023-24, OG until 2024-25, Flynn's two year team option has him locked in until 2023-24. The players that we have to pay now or soon are Lowry who is a UFA, Boucher who has one more year under contract, Gary Trent Jr who is an RFA, Jalen Harris who is coming off his two-way contract now and if we want to resign them Khem Birch and Stanimal. Based on our current contracts and cap holds, we have the 4th highest practical cap space after OKC, Spurs and Knicks so having to pay some of our players who are really just Trent Jr, Harris, Boucher and Lowry isn't a concern."
Yup Gary Harris had it knocked out by CJ and it was blazers ball I think
"5 and Gary Harris, do it."
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
"Well he replaced Barton's production after he went down, jerami grant's too and Gary harris. He is their 3rd best player."
"Philly needs a player to help them contend though. The teams in full rebuild mode have very few of those guys.   Thunder have SGA, who is probably straight up better than Simmons at this point, so I can't imagine they trade him. Other than that, it's basically Kemba and his degenerative knees, a million draft picks, and a G league squad.   Rockets have washed John Wall on one of the league's worst contracts, Eric Gordon, and Christian Wood. No deal there.   Magic could do like, Gary Harris, Terrance Ross, and picks? I don't think Philly is taking Fultz back, and it doesn't make sense to move Isaac. No deal there.  Detroit could offer Grant, Cory Joseph, and picks.  Don't think they would offer a top 5 pick. Don't see a deal there, either."
"I was initially disappointed by the Gordon trade to the Nuggets.  However, RJ Hampton impressed me in the last month of the season.   Also, the Gary Harris expiring contract could legitimately be enough to acquire Ben Simmons at this point.  Its time we reunite the brick brothers."
How long are his arms?   Magic might offer Fultz and expiring Gary Harris contract for Simmons and every draft pick Philly can legally trade.
Hear me out.  Ben Simmons for Markelle Fultz and Gary Harris   Who says no?
Terrence Ross and Gary Harris
1.  Gary Harris plays for Orlando   2.  Tobias is great in the post.
Gary Harris plays for Orlando.
Gary Harris in the high post is the game plan? Yikes
Denver should trade Aaron Gordon for Gary Harris
Disagree.  Gary “Gary Harris” Harris is my all time fave
Gary Harris would be an awesome 2 option though
Gary Harris stans out to kill tonight
Was this written by Gary Harris lmao
"How can you say we don't count because early picks (with 0 top 5 picks, 1 top 10 pick lol) and then cite drafting 3 MVPs who were all taken top 5? And no mention of Jokic round 2, literally the latest MVP ever drafted by 20 picks. Monte Morris(another round 2), Jamal and MPJ. Not even counting Nurkic, Gary Harris, Fournier, Malik Beasley (also round 2) Almost every player the Nuggets have taken for the last half decade has surpassed expectations. I don't see how two two lottery picks (both of which were home runs despite being late lottery picks) negates any of that.  Not saying OKC isn't a great FO but they're not ""easily the best drafting team."""
"Thybulle, Gary Harris, Marc Gasol, AG"
Based off what? Gary Harris was just used as salary filler. The main point of that trade was to get rj and the pick. And Wendell has been good for us. Who would New Orleans have given up?
"magic seemed to be high on some questionable players at the deadline Wendell, Gary Harris  They probably could have gotten what others perceive as better hauls for both of their players"
He'd be Gary Harris
"His value won’t change as long as he doesn’t play, but GM’s have different opinions on him. I’m sure some small market teams see superstar potential in him but they don’t want to pay over his current value. It’s more so teams going into tank mode that want to give away their stars. Vucevic got traded for two picks, Wendell Carter Jr and Otto Porter Jr. Aaron Gordon got traded for Gary Harris and RJ Hampton. Other players will lose value and deals will become available."
PG: Killian Hayes   SG: whoever the Lakers start at SG this year   SF: Gary Harris  PF: Darius Bazley  C: Khrm Birch
Paul George hitting the step back 3 to to cap off an impressive comeback and draw okc level with Denver just for Gary Harris to hit the game winning buzzer beater.  https://youtu.be/awh1JbCP400
8-2? I feel like that’s a bold claim for a team who has 0 players who have ever score 18 ppg and the ones who have ever come the closest were Gary Harris 4 years ago and MCW in his ROTY campaign  I feel like they will starts 2-8 and then all the injuries will happen
"Cavs had a trade in place for PG after 2017 where Love goes to the Nuggets, Pacers get Gary Harris and picks. Pacers GM backed out last second after all teams made a verbal agreement"
Gary Harris
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris aka Wary Warris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DurMickey and HarFraud
What is Gary Harris
Franz is a 4.  I’d expect Chuma to start at the 3 and Ross to be the backup small forward until he gets traded.  Maybe RJ gets a look at the 3 once that happens.  I also doubt Cole starts.  Gary Harris probably has the starting job till Markelle gets back to recoup some trade value for himself by the deadline because the contract might be hard to move.
I don't think 'Prime' Gary Harris is a real thing lol... dude is average at best
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris !"
Prime Gary Harris lol. He’s 26
Prime Gary Harris ?? He's still young come on .
"Gary ""Don't call me ""Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"" Harris"
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
Gary Harris
"Yeah, let’s just get OG- oh wait, Masai, our previous GM, sniped him from us one pick before we could  Might as well let AG walk then, right? Gary Harris and RJ, gave ‘em up for a one year rental? Gone to the wind like Grant?"
"Tell me you don’t watch the games without telling me you don’t watch the games. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.  He’s the most versatile defender we have who is capable of guarding wings, guards, and some bigs. And he helps unlock some of our other guys (when we are fully healthy) and allows them to thrive in ways they can’t without him as the skeleton key on defense.  On offense, his rim gravity as a roll threat makes our offense so dynamic. Because we have two athletic forwards who are both roll threats along with 4 shooters who are all 40% from the arc (Gordon being the only exception), and 4 guys who are all above average to exceptional ball handlers and facilitators, it allows us to be very multiple and dynamic on offense and present very difficult looks for the defense. Stuff like that may not show up on the stat sheet if you’re just looking at his points/rebounds/assists (which is - no offense - one of the laziest ways of doing basketball analysis and a huge pet peeve of mine).  As an example, everyone is familiar with there 2 man game that jokic and Murray run where we basically clear everyone else out. As soon as we added Gordon, we started adding wrinkles with him as a third man directly in the action with Barton and MPJ as spacers. Gordon and Murray would be running screen the screener actions right on top of Jokic who had the option of running a PNR or DHO with either of them and then he presented the threat of popping out to the three point line as well. And if you send any help off of MPJ or Barton they would bury a 3 - and if any one was caught sleeping MPJ or Gordon would just get a free dunk on a back door cut from Jokic or Murray. Add in the ability for Barton to cut across and take over ball handling duties and reverse the action across the court and it was a lot for defenses to account for.  AG added all of that. Those are things that Gary Harris (who I love to death) and Jerami Grant never added to the offense (despite Jerami also being a plus athlete he seemingly never wanted to cut to the rim for ez dunks). And defensively he might be a slight downgrade against guards compared to Gary, but he’s a big upgrade in terms of defensive versatility and he’s a better/more willing defender than Jerami."
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
I don’t really think of the Nuggets as a hospital team but they have surprisingly bad injury luck. Gary Harris missed out on his potential. Murray tears an ACL right when the Nuggets start looking scary and the west is wide open. Gotta pray for Jokic and MPJ.
Gary 'Gary Harris' Harris
Nuggets fans love Gary Harris more than their FO did unfortunately.
The decline of Gary Harris is one of my great sadnesses in the nba
Gary Harris
"I wanted to go to this game, instead I got to see Gary Harris drill a buzzer beater right in PG's face."
"The bigger issue is us not having any good point of attack defender. You think any center without one unless they are AD, Bam or Giannis are doing anything against these guards?  For reference see how important Gary Harris was in the 2020 Playoffs. Night and day in comparison. PJ Dozier is his replacement and he was injured too"
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris should not be 3rd off the bench.
I always get confused with Harry Giles and Gary Harris
"Yes, a team that went to WCF 2 yrs agowith Gary Harris as the starting SG and 2nd round last year with Campazzo and Austin Rivers as starters wouldn't have been better with Steph curry instead... Sounds reasonable"
gary harris maybe
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
Gary Harris
"&gt; Also Herro was in the trade talks  Yeah, I'm sure he was.  We just thought it was ridiculous that some fans thought Herro should be considered untouchable for Harden.  I mean, ultimately, it's not that bad, every team overrates their young players.  I've seen fans call the likes of RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Gary Harris, future stars.  Plenty of people on my team's sub think Mitchell Robinson will be Rudy Gobert that is also a 3pt marksman.  Every fanbase is guilty of this."
"People are acting like Morey handled this badly because he doesn’t value Simmons at two second rounders and Gary Harris Jr, like the supreme intelligent Redditor does."
A guy that guards him well 1v1 that doesn’t get a lot of credit is Gary Harris. Wasn’t on the Nuggets come playoff time thank god
"Seems to me more like common sense.  A pick and roll is designed to create a 2 v 1 opportunity and Gobert doesn't have a strong point of attack defender to mitigate that advantage.  Jokic the same although to a lesser extent since the other 2 are more mobile than him, but he still lacks a great point of attack defender since Gary Harris was traded."
Picks Gary Harris  Look how they’ve massacred my boy…..
"This sounds like it was written by Steve Clifford.       The guy started veterans James Ennis, Dwayne Bacon, Chasson Randle, and Khem Birch after the trade deadline when it was clear the Magic were trying to develop their young guys. It led to a meaningless win over the Pelicans, like many other meaningless late season Magic wins that have hurt their/your lottery odds and led to worse draft picks.      Your best prospect in years was Jonathan Isaac and didn’t even average 10 FGA/game by this third season under Clifford. MCW is atrocious lol. Gordon was so consistently underwhelming I have no idea how you could type that “he looked so good”… the Nuggets gave up a recent 24th pick in Hampton and a protected first rounder five years away, as well as the corpse of Gary Harris.       Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career. To suggest otherwise is true revisionist history."
"Nah, we don’t really. The most proven scorers on the team are Gary Harris and terrence Ross. Gary Harris 17.5 ppg in 17/18 is the highest average that a player on our roster accomplished. We have zero offensive firepower to be frank. The guys are young and some can dvelop into scorers over the years but this year will be very very ugly. We’d have to be an elite defensive unit to get to 30 wins, even then I think our offense will be so historically bad it’s not even possible."
"Denver vs. Bucks  If Jamal Murray gets back healthy, there’s no guarantee AT ALL that Lakers are the top team in the West. Denver was amazing post-AG Trade and now they have also added a bit of depth with Jeff Green.  Each playoffs, someone has been hurt (Barton, Murray, Monte Morris, or Gary Harris) and yet Jokic has been great and Denver has had some big wins.   Bucks I think has to be a bet on Nets being injured. Especially now without PJ Tucker who was needed to guard KD, I don’t see any chance the Bucks getting past a healthy Nets team. It needs to be KD that’s hurt for the Bucks to advance imo."
"Facts. The lack of a second ballhandler or someone that was at minimum an ok threat to score is what plagued us. Rose saw double and triple coverage so often due to that. The regular season record the Bulls had then belies some of the struggles the offense had. Rose had to go Super Saiyan just to pull out wins because we had no one else that was a consistent offensive threat. You’d think Kyle Korver would have helped, but he had an uncharacteristically tough time shooting while he was with us. Running 2 PG lineups with CJ Watson and Rose left a lot to be desired on perimeter D, so you lost as much on one end as you gained on another.  This is another reason breaking up Jimmy and Rose was devastating. We finally had a backcourt parter that could help and we damn near stole a series from the Cavs, but the FO was short sighted and didn’t give Rose and Jimmy time to gel or keep the talent that worked with them. They traded Deng at his peak because they were too cheap to pay him. Have an aging (but still good) Pau Gasol a contract even though he didn’t fit our timeline. Let Kyle Korver go for nothing. Passed on Gary Harris and Nurkic for Doug McDermott. God there was just so much wasted potential."
"odd pick for me but gary harris, i remember watching him in his ""prime"" and thought to myself he could be better than harden, man that fell off quickly, want him to  play great in the magic and get traded/bought out to a contending team, really love his game"
Garland will be the Cavs leading scorer and assist leader. Gary 'Gary Harris' Harris has a huge comeback season as a starting SG next to Suggs

"Glad for Magic fans, after years of mediocrity they can finally enjoy watching young players developp and their coach seem smart enough to do the ""well I'll play RoLo and Gary Harris 35 minutes per game)"
Gary Harris plays for the Magic… When did this happen?
Oh that’s where Gary Harris went
"That's Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris for you"
"Bulls also traded 2 1st round picks for Doug McDermot, those picks became Gary Harris and Jusiv Nurkic."
I want that Gary Harris play on repeat too
"Yeah considering the Bulls still had Noah, Taj and just acquired Pau Gasol that same summer, there wouldn’t have been a lot of minutes for Nurkic. Gary Harris and MCDermott turned out about the same"
After Gary Harris made a huge jump in performance in his 3rd season I was convinced he was going to be the next great shooting guard in the league and he'd be what Murray is for Jokic right now.
"2014 draft Chicago receives McDermott, along with Anthony Randolph, a 6-11, 225-pound forward with six years of NBA experience, in exchange for its two first round selections—Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris, taken 16th and 19th, respectively—and the lesser of the Bulls’ two 2015 second round picks (Chicago’s and Portland’s)."
We also traded 2 draft picks that ended up being Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott.
"Do you know who Denver’s center was when we got Jokic? It was Jusuf Nurkic, who outside of Gary Harris, was our best prospect on the team. Hell there was a time he was considered our best player by some fans. We didn’t just hand Jokic minutes to be the guy, especially over someone who was considered our actual future. He earned ever minute he got as a low 2nd round pick until we literally had controversy to get him to start. True we were still bad so we could afford the experiment but it’s not like we didn’t make him earn every bit of time he got. He was even benched for a bit for his own piss poor defense.  +/- isn’t a great stat over one game but over a four game span it can still show trends. And blocks are what make the dude appear on the front page of this sub. He’ll get a block here or there in garbage time of the game and while they are good. They’re against deep back ups and a lot of them are coming from him being out of position, another bad habit he still hasn’t fixed"
"The only healthy wing defenders we have right now are Gary Harris and Franz Wagner. This was Gary Harris' first game of the season because he's been injured so I think we didn't wanna ride him too hard, and Franz was coming off playing nearly 40 minutes in the first half of the B2B so same deal.  Ideally Chuma Okeke or Jonathan Isaac would be on Jimmy but both are out atm."
Gary Harris
" I know no one will like this suggestion, but this is how I would handle these sorts of situations in the new CBA.    At a certain key date (end of one season, beginning of a new season or something) a player can officially request a trade through the league office to get off a team he really has a problem with.  To offset this, his contract could take a hit depending on how many years he has left - for example, with a five year supermax- if its in the season following signing the new contract, its value can be reduced by up to 50%. If he requests the trade after the second year it can only reduced by 40%, third year 30% etc.  How much it is actually reduced by is determined by how much incoming trade value the trading team chooses to take back - anything from full value (another 40 mil per year contract or combination of contracts) down to 50% value (a 20 mil/year contract or contracts)  I think this makes trading a guy they’ve invested in much more palatable for a team and gives them some additional flexibility to get the trade done.  One of the biggest hurdles to trading for a max player for teams stuck in the lottery or on the fringe of the playoffs is they often don’t already have more than one player of equal monetary value, if that, even though they may have several promising young players on cheaper contracts.  So they have to ship off a whole bunch of players along with the real trade targets to make the money work.  I’m thinking of teams like Orlando, Detroit, Indiana, and Memphis who all have no one making more than 20 million right now or New Orleans and Washington who have only one guy currently making the max who they want to keep and not trade.  Getting a disgruntled star on the cheap also makes the trade more appealing for other teams.  Of course the player REALLY has to want out if he’s willing to sacrifice up to half his pay for a change of scenery.  But this can also incentivize the player to stay and try to make it work for another season or two, to reduce his losses.  In the Simmons situation, this would allow Philadelphia to trade him for a player or combination of players in the 20 million dollar range and create some cap space if they can’t find a deal for a player/s in the same salary range as his current contract. So while a team like Washington might be unwilling to give up Beal for Simmons, this would allow them to make an offer of a guy like Dinwiddie or Caldwell-Pope or Kuzma or Bertans, plus any combination of lower salary players along with draft picks to get the deal done.  A team like Orlando could trade Gary Harris, a high value rookie like Jalen Suggs, and draft picks without having to completely gut their team for a guy who has already shown he can be a headache.  I do think even with this the CBA would have to get stricter provisions for “injured” or “mentally unable to play” players to keep someone from being able to just sit and home and collect checks rather than officially requesting a trade.  Alright, feel free to destroy me now :)"
"The biggest difference between this game and our first two blowout losses were the rotations. We have had 6 guys out for the start of the season, and 3-4 of those are probably gonna be the starters once everyone is healthy.   Mosley (our rookie head coach) is still experimenting with lineups and the starting lineup we've trotted out (Cole, Suggs, Franz, WCJ, Bamba) has actually performed really well, and has been +18 in total when they share the court despite two big blowouts.  The key to this game was Mosley   1) Played the starters + Ross more - we had a much more equal distribution of minutes our first two games, and with so many guys out that meant the end of our bench and two-way players were getting serious burn. This game we just ran with our young guys for the most part, and then Ross took us home down the stretch.  2) Tried to keep the starting unit intact for the most part, by only replacing 1 or 2 of them at a time. In the first two games we'd have 3-4 subs coming in at once, and then what was essentially the 3rd string squad would give up massive runs.  The most encouraging thing is that the starting unit that has performed really well will basically be our bench for a lot of the season, once we get some guys back. Plus Markelle and JI fit almost exactly what we are missing most right now, someone who can attack the paint and draw defenses in, and a PF who can guard the perimeter but still help on the boards and protecting the rim. We still probably won't win a ton of games, but I think we will be an exciting team if we can just get Gary Harris and Chuma back, let alone Markelle and JI."
"Yep.. Isaac and Fultz are obvious, Gary Harris was supposed to start the season as our starting 2, and Chuma Okeke would probably be starting over Franz"
"Gonna look like a genius when both get traded to Orlando for Gary Harris, Markelle Fultz, Mo Bamba and a pair of Disney season passes."
“Gary Harris is going to be a better version of Klay Thompson” ooof that aged horribly
"We have Okeke, JI, Fultz, E'Twuan Moore, MCW and Gary Harris out until further notice. Like, take any other team and take five guys out of there normal rotation.   We're not 9 wins bad, but it's going to be tough until we start to get guys back"
Suggs was coming off of a sickness.  He probably shouldn't have played but due to Gary Harris getting injured he got rushed  back as a starter nonetheless.  His offense is a work in progress and San Antonio was like the worst possible match up for him.  The Knicks won't be any better.
if they give up picks I will give them Gary Harris and Terrance Ross
what do you have against Gary Harris lol
"Couldn't really think of all-time, but for right now, maybe:   Devonte' Graham  Gary Harris  Josh Jackson  Marvin Bagley III  Andre Drummond"
"In my opinion, MPJ doesn’t have a great “feel for the game” yet. Which is fine because he has started less than one full season’s worth of games, and I expect it to improve. But it’s one of the most important parts of playing next to Jokic. Guys like Jamal, monte Morris, Gary Harris in the past, fit so well because they see the whole floor and react according to the situation, and that’s where Jokic is most dangerous. Finding cutters, off script passes, just general game sense. MPJ has all the tools and skills, but can get stagnant on offense when a play isn’t run for him. I think that is the key to really unleashing him offensively."
Pretty sure it’s a nickname the same way nuggs had for Gary “off night” Harris.
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
I miss good Gary Harris
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
Gary Harris ever play an NBA game? Dude been injured his whole career.
When is Gary Harris not injured Jesus man
" Jameer Nelson, Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkolu, Ryan Anderson, and Dwight Howard  vs  Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner, and Wendell Carter Jr  Not to mention, it’s SVG vs Jamahl Mosley, who is making his debut as a head coach.   The 2022 team is absolutely fucked"
They had a bunch of tradable guys like Jerami Grant and Gary Harris who coulda been included.
"With vets like Terrence Ross, Robin Lopez, Gary Harris, Etwuan Moore and MCW it will be fun to watch their growth. Magic need to focus on adding shooting and wing help which is why if Adrian Griffin Jr is healthy he would be perfect for us at the 3 spot. Magic will have $28 million in capspace next yr and it will be fun to watch the growth of all these guys and see what we get for our vets during the trade deadline."
"Kevin Love, Brandon Ingram, Isaacs, Gary Harris, Donte DiVincenzo"
"You do understand what happens when mid range shooter alongside lob threat go 2v1 due to guard defending dies on the block over and over?  It's not so much Jokic fault, it's on Denver guards for the biggest part. Missing not one but several of their best defensive guards doesn't help but magnifies the problem. Check Denver vs Utah games season before, with and without Gary Harris."
"I think there’s a level of training and preparation in college that is being underrated in this thread.  Some guys could really benefit from the style of a college coach/program to prepare them for the NBA.   I think one of the better examples of this is Tom Izzo and Michigan State, as much as it pains me to say it as a Buckeye fan.  Lots of MSU players who went under the radar have succeeded because of what he teaches and what the program has to offer.  Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, and Draymond Green come to mind.  Obviously, the Ignite didn’t exist back then.  The program is too new to compare players who went to the Ignite vs college.  But I think that some colleges are better at helping players truly improve than the Ignite.  The Ignite is a lot better for players who are basically locked into the lottery before they even play a game.  That’s cause they already have a lot of talent, they just need to sharpen it.  I think that’s the fundamental difference and what the choice comes down to."

"yep, the issue wasn't a lack of Murray (although he would've definitely helped). It was the loss of Gary Harris who was their best backcourt defender and the fact that Jokic can't carry a team on offense while also being targeted over and over again on defense. He just got worn out too quickly and was exploited."
Crazy to think I thought in the early years that Gary Harris and Beal would be equal players in their careers
The Aaron Gordon trade made sense but damn I miss Gary ‘Gary Harris’ Harris as a Nugget.
Wtf Gary Harris is on the Magic
"Yeah but they must've had a scouting report on him and knew that he was a reasonable pick within the range. It's not like they had nothing on Mitchell. They looked at his scouting report, knew he would be around that range and decided to take Tyler Lydon 24th and Trey Lyles.  I'm not trying to say something like they could've taken Draymond because he was a second round pick or Pascal Siakam because he was picked 27th the next year. They knew all the data around him, he was reasonably expected to go within their range and chose to take two mediocre players instead.  Of course, you can make excuses about fit with Gary Harris but ultimately, they're not going into a draft without a scouting report on every possible option."
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"Yeah I used to go to Bros every Friday and Saturday night and I would see Gary Harris, Trey Lyles, and Myles Turner there all the time in the off-season. Indy barely has a night scene and they closed a lot of the bars on Georgia Street"
Ya that night we played the nuggets so Gary Harris was there as well. I can understand why no star wants to live here. Ben Simmons is about to live in Chicago and take that 30 min private jet ride in everyday.
"People often forget who's first line of defense for Jokic's whole career.   Mudiay, Murray, Barton, Jameer Nelson and played without wings. Only decent guard defender was Gary Harris who when came back in jazz series helped team pull out from being down 3-1. Craig only was ""good defender"" with big ?.   Large portion of minutes Jokic shared with Wilson Chandler and Barton + Murray if you look at that team DRTG was around 28-30th about two straight seasons.   Funny thing is even when Jokic sits in those line ups defense gets even worse.   My point is Denver needs bit better perimeter defense if they want to give Jokic a fighting chance, its unrealistic to expect Jokic to control defense and basically be the team offense for 35+ minutes."
"What team is dumb enough to trade for Kyrie? The Kings? Kyrie for Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson? Kyrie to the Magic for Gary Harris, Mo Bamba, and Robin Lopez? Lol"
"&gt;Kawhi, Tatum, George,  all 3 of those guys are all around stars that wouldn't just be a 3 and D role player so I think considering them to be the same kind of player as Bridges is a bit disingenious. Bridges's comparisons would be more guys like OG, Gary Harris, KCP, Danny Green, Jae Crowder and Klay (Who I'd consider to be the best among that role) so saying he's one of the best might not be that far off."

"It’s fine bro. You obviously just have an irrational hate for Luka. As if he didn’t drop 42/8/14 in a close game 5 where there was no “stat padding.” Zubac also only played 2 minutes game 7 when Luka put up 46/7/14. Who was he scoring on then? Or as if the 2020 playoffs didn’t happen where he got the switch on Reggie Jackson and hit the buzzer beater. You keep pretending like Luka scored 0 on Kawhi or some shit.  Meanwhile, let’s see Dames good series in the last few years. Denver 2021 no good guard defenders, he plays well. Lakers 2020 have good defense, he plays poorly. 2019 GSW plays a good defensive team, plays poorly. Did meh against Denver 2019 because they had Gary Harris back then who was good on defense. He was atrocious 2018 playoffs with Jrue Holiday. Maybe Dame is the one u need to worry about being exposed. Because Luka has played a good defensive team twice in the playoffs without any reliable offensive help. I know dame don’t got the best squad around him either, but he definitely has some offensive talent.   Anyways, we will see how this season goes. I do hope the defensive improvements the team made help Dame and Portland as a team out. But the fact u only tried to bring Luka down and not counter with anything about Dame and how good he is (because I know he is a top 10 guy) just screams that u are a hater of a player."
"I'm surprised they're starting Gary Harris over Cole, Markelle, or another prospect like RJ."
"magic starters: jalen suggs, gary harris, terrence ross, franz wagner, wendell carter jr"
"The major issue vs both Utah and Phoenix wasn't Jokic though. Guards were terrible defensively leaving Jokic 1v2 where he has to pick either midrange or lob. Once Gary Harris returned from injury vs Utah &gt; defense solidified instantly. Vs Phoenix PJ was out as their best guard defender and Barton just returned from injury (and was advised not to cross minutes restrictions). Because they didn't have Murray on top to help offensive side and MPJ got hurt too, Joker got exhausted and it was visible.  Tbh, Embiid and Rudy are two of the best defensive centers in the game (Capela?) but in that type scenario they suffer too."
"Let's just say you are grossly oversimplified the situation.  The year we won 54 (54!) games Barton and Gary got badly hurt (and have never been the same). There were two other above average starters on that team (Murray, Sap) and then a bunch of kids. Young players are almost always net negatives and yet we came within a game of the WCF. If Barton and Gary had stayed healthy you'd have a point-- but they didn't.  The next year we traded Malik bc he wanted to be a starter and brought in Grant. But Sap's play fell off a cliff and Harris play fell off a cliff post-injuries. I'd call them both below average starters by playoff team standards. Morris rise sort of replaced Malik. Torrey Craig is a solid 10th man but the rest of the bench was a net negative pretty much the whole year due to the lack of scoring. People also have a misperception in regards to how good Grant for us. Every stat painted him as a negative player until he was moved to SF in the playoffs. Luckily Murray took a leap forward. And as to MPJ-- the reason he wasn't playing is bc Malone was focused on developing him as a player and getting rid of bad habbits. Again, young players usually don't add to winning.  Last year was the most talented team on paper... except we lost Grant and Plumlee (our backup Cs were AWFUL) and right when we traded for Gordon we lost Barton, Monte, PJ and Murray to injury.  Long story short-- as the guys original comment indicated- we have had horrific injury luck during Jokic's main run. Including injuries that destroyed the career of Harris and turned Barton injury plagued. Meanwhile-- a lot of the depth you point to were kids on rookie contracts aka that period in a career where they aren't particularly good. But our coaching staff is elite at player development and so they are in a good place to take a leap once they leave Denver (see Malik, Vandy or even Grant)."
"If they're hypothetically trading down from #1 to #7, they're getting an absolute fucking haul.   It's probably something like #7, next year's unprotected 1st, Gary Harris or Jokic, Mudiay, and then maybe some sort of cap dump for Philly in return for someone like Wilson Chandler or something."
Gary Harris
"Oh damn, my bad.  Then I’d say go with Isaac or Wendell Carter, or maybe Gary Harris."
Gary Harris is older than me and has clearly never heard of Fred Savage smh
"Toronto could work - but not for Siakam, which has been popular. Does embiid/siakam make markedly more sense than embiid/Simmons? Nah, the sixers need shooting and ball handling back in any Simmons trade. With fillers/draft picks The trade could be:   Raptors get: Simmons, Milton  Sixers get: Fred VV, OG Anunoby   FVV is the exact kind of player who would thrive in Philly - culturally and fit, he’s a marksman with underrated playmaking ability. OG would be a trade piece, further reason to flip Tobias Harris, an upgrade over starting Danny green or a combination of the 3   Toronto gets a revamp centered on Simmons, with siakam helping protect the rim, dragic - crafty enough to be an effective PNR partner with Ben, Gary Trent, and Milton/Barnes. This raises Toronto’s ceiling as a whole, while maintaining flexibility with flippable assets."
He’ll always be Gary “Gary Harris” Harris to me
Gary Harris looks like a character from A Bug's Life
"Gary 'Gary ""Savage"" Harris' Harris"
Inspiring words from Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
"The game is changing towards ball dominant perimeter players. Those are the players that Jokic often struggles against.   The Nets have better defensive 5 men than Jokic and they’re possibly the great collection of offensive talent of all time. As good as Jokic is offensively, he’s obviously not giving you the same value as the combination of those 3 guys. You mentioned the league changing and the Nets fit that. Last year they were able to throw out fairly switchable lineups with guys like KD, Green and Claxton at the 4/5. Green is okay defensively, KD can be really good as switch and help defender. Claxton, too. The Nets won’t be an elite defense, but they don’t contradict this point regarding Jokic’s defense.   You’re misunderstanding positionless basketball. It doesn’t mean center defense is no longer important. It means we now have smaller players occupying spots we traditionally see big men in. But the guys who are doing this are high level defensive players like Green, Tucker and Covington. Positionless basketball hurts Jokic defensively in that today there is more and more space to cover and more guys who can light him up in the PnR.   Regarding the Jazz series, yes, it matters who your center is. Beyond the fact that Mitchell scored well, the Jazz were getting whatever they wanted. Lobs, floaters, open mid range jumpers. Jokic had zero answer for any of that through the first 4 or so games of that series. Not only that, but Jokic’s deficiencies force the Nuggets to play a more aggressive system which during that series yielded open threes. Even if a guy is going to shoot crazy well against you, you want to make him do that on tough shots and count on that coming back to Earth. If you’re giving him easy looks it’s much more likely he’s going to maintain that level of shooting.   Your analysis of that Jazz-Nuggets series is off. You’re misremembering how the center battle played out and I think it’s telling that you cited stats without context. Jokic did not dominate Gobert individually. Jokic was actually largely reduced to a spot up shooter doing his damage off the advantages that Murray was able to create. It wasn’t until the very end of the series when he got the best of Gobert on that post up. Otherwise, as an individual scorer, Gobert had Jokic defended pretty well.     When you’re talking about a big man doing well on things like pick and pop, that’s generally not just on the opposing big. The way the Jazz played Gobert would have to cover Murray’s attack and race back out to Jokic to contest the shot. That’s not Jokic torching him, that’s the defense giving up something to take away something else.   You can point to Mitchell’s hot shooting, the 3-1 comeback and even Gary Harris’ absence, but going down 3-1 in the first place counts. Maybe if you’re facing Steph Curry or Paul and Booker you can’t afford to have 4 games of no defense because you won’t make a comeback. If you don’t see the issue with his defense or don’t see the huge value difference in Gobert/Embiid defensively by comparison, I think you should watch more stuff on them. Again, when you’re saying Gobert got torched by Jokic I think it’s safe to say you’re missing a lot of what’s really happening."
"Although the nuggets technically drafted McDermott, they realistically drafted Gary Harris and Nurkic in that draft. Trading draft picks in the NBA is an overly complicated system!"
Wish Gary Harris was still a part of this core
"&gt; jerami grant  Grant is overrated as all hell on defense, and Gary Harris didn't even play until Game 6 of the Utah series, and was still injured the entire Clippers series. I think you're severely overestimating the impact those 2 players had on that playoff run."
"You're completely ignoring jerami grant and gary harris who were your 2 best defenders in the bubble. Gordon is a good defender but far from elite, good luck trying to do anything to lebron, KD, kawhi etc. I want jokic to win a ring but i just dont think this MPJ contract is the move, especially since MPJ is worthless on defense."
"I’m just having a little trouble understanding. Gary Harris had a hip injury, which caused him to lose a lot of his agility,which in turn really messed up his offence,yet  his perimeter defense, is still top tier and elite. How does this work? Wouldn’t his elite perimeter defence go away, as that requires hip mobility, lateral movement and agility are big components of defense?"
"Murray is fine at best, which is less than ""solid"" to me. Jokic has his value in that he's big, strong, smart, and has quick hands. that said, it doesn't matter if you put Hakeem Olajuwons mind into his body, he's never gonna be what you'd call above average. Porter showed a little potential but the injury history is brutal and he was being absolutely torched last time he played. He grabs boards and Jokic and Murray try but they're just limited defenders.   it's certainly dangerous team building to have this much money in 1.5 way players. If Gary Harris hadn't fallen apart due to injuries he'd be the perfect fit there with Gordon to help patch the holes."
"I mean, we traded Gary Harris, but that's not a centerpiece. Murray is"
The doctors fixed him up. But he suffered another hip injury in 2020 :(  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gary-harris-player-injuries
Yeah we missed Gary Harris and Barton a lot too
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
"True. Forgot about the cornerstone piece of the title. Nonetheless, he had high hopes for a second. Maybe not near Gary Harris now that I think about it."
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris had a bigger problem with injuries than he did with performance.  Staying on the court is the most important thing to maintain sharpness and conditioning."
Gary Harris?
Roy wasn’t young tho. He was older. Gary Harris was very young
Gary Harris had a hip and elbow injury.  The elbow directly impacted shooting and the hip impacted good agility.
Gary Harris fucked up his hips and was never the same. He was one of the best finishers in the league and you could make an all time top 10 layup highlight from some of his acrobatic finishes. He was an amazing cutter and would frequently dunk it on ppl. The fact that he shot like 42% from 3 for 2 seasons before his injury was huge. He's also an elite perimeter defender and saved us in the bubble against the jazz when he came back. Injuries really fucked him and his best offensive years for us were at a time where nobody watched the Nuggets. Alotta ppl have no clue what his game was like. There was a real discussion as to who was better and going to be better between him and Jamal.
"Worth noting that injuries really derailed Gary Harris’ development. Not only did he miss time, but he supposedly played injured for a good stretch. Which led to more problems. He had to completely change his game and I think that messed with his confidence and shooting as well. Just goes to show how much luck factors into a successful career in sports (not that he’s “unsuccessful”)."
"It def would have been an overpay based on he was providing in Denver, but you would hope that the organization knew that he had more untapped potential. I will admit that I was mostly thinking about Grant's deal in comparison to Gordon's, totally forgetting the net savings they got by dumping Gary Harris. Either way, really hoping we get to see a finals run with this squad in the next couple of years"
Gary harris has had one of the weirdest career arcs I’ve ever seen. He was already a great 3 and D player who was outplaying his draft position and then completely regressed. I genuinely have no idea what happened to him
"Just to name a few:  Oj Mayo — “the next MJ,” Good ol’ Jimmer (I still have faith), Dennis Smith Jr., Jabari “no knees” Parker, Gary Harris (maybe this will be the year)"
Gary Harris
"How about Orlando as a 3rd team? Something like this:  Minnesota receives: Ben Simmons  Philly receives: Patrick Beverly, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Gary Harris, Minnesota 2024 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2026 1st Rounder  Orlando receives: Minnesota 2022 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2024 2nd Rounder, throw in players to make salaries work.  It's a decent start I think"
I'd love to text this hypothesis and see Jokic play with Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver instead of Jamal Murray and Gary Harris
"The Nuggets of 2016 look nowhere near the same as the Nuggets of 2021. Murray hasn’t even been in the league for that long, nor is he Jokic’s oldest teammate. That title went from Gary Harris to Will Barton last season"
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"&gt;When he had Grant, Craig, Mason, Gary Harris-- he was good in defense and Denver was in WCF.  No he was still bad at defense, he can succeed despite that because he's one of the best offensive players in the league."
"No he is not terrible. He is terrible in rim protection. But that is only one part. And you didn' t read. When he had Grant, Craig, Mason, Gary Harris-- he was good in defense and Denver was in WCF. He has weakest defenders around him from all stars.   For example, Giannis is terrible on midrange, ft and 3 pts, does it mean that he is terrible at offense? Jokic has fast hands, great rebounder, great positioning, top 10 in steals, so many deflections, he is strong( thay can' t push him inside) and that makes him at least average. He had Facu, Rivers, Barton in front of him🙄 He doesn' t have even 1 good backourt defender🙄"
"As a center in the pick and roll, you do need some help on the point of attack.  Against the Blazers in 2019, Gary Harris was on Lillard (who struggled despite Jokic's allegedly terrible defence), leaving a young Murray on McCollum who did cook us.  Against the Jazz, Harris was injured until either Game 5 or 6 (can't remember which), and his return helped slow down Mitchell and swing the series.  Jokic is by no means some great defender, and that is somewhat limiting coming from your center. But with better point of attack defenders there's no reason he couldn't be more than functional. He's already won four playoff series in the West over the last three years, despite his 'terrible' defence"
"&gt;Jokic just got Aaron Gordon this year and Gary Harris has been washed the last 3 years. Talent wise they are similiar but lets not act like KAT didnt play with some solid players. Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.   He had Paul Millsap who was very good until last year and the perfect partner for him in the frontcourt and Gary was good 2 years ago and okay 1 year ago certainly not bad players.  &gt;Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.  HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM PLAY IN MINNESOTA? BAD DEFENCE,NO REBOUNDING,DIDN'T PASS,SCORED 20 PPG ON 54% TS. THERE IS A REASON ONLY KAT IS ON THE ROSTER STILL FROM THOSE TEAMS"

Part of the reason the Nuggets were ready to get rid of Gary was because they have faith that PJ Dozier can replace the Harris role on defense while being a somewhat better shooter on way less money. The POA defender is probably the most important position in the Nuggets defense because we give up so many floaters and mid range shots that you need someone like Gary(who’s Jrue Holiday level at getting through screens) to stay on the ball handlers hip when they drive and force them to make a decision with Jokic’s massive plodding body standings in front of you and a great defender in Gary on them. Like you said Gary coming back probably saved us vs Utah because we had a guard who could get through screens and let us play defense the way we wanted to. Mitchell couldn’t split the traps or get straight line drives and pull-ups when Jokic dropped every play like games 1-4
I think Aaron Gordon helps because with Grant gone they lost their wing defender but they got rid of Gary Harris who was their best guard defender. I felt better about them when they had both last year which was enough to slow down Paul George and Kawhi
[PG/Gary Harris to end the game in Denver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awh1JbCP400)
I'd rather keep TRoss and move Gary Harris if possible. The human torch has been great here in Orlando but if he wants a trade I understand.
"No one has said this. The conversation has always been about if he's worth that contract and trying not to overvalue your own guys and getting stuck overpaying them ala Otto Porter, Gary Harris, etc."
"It was actually 80 million and here’s a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It’s honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing…  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who’s your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
"Gary Harris, Michael Carter-Williams for Hield maybe?  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, not many teams seem to need guards who are only looking to score. The league has taken the small ball thing too far."

"Yeah the reason is popularity. Nobody watches Denver except Denver fans. There's a reason more advanced analysts adore the guy and casuals don't even know what he does. His advanced stats are a reflection of all the little things he does. There's no denying Denvers roster is better but a part of the reason why its better is cause Jokic makes it better and not because its perfect. We had massive injures all throughout the season with starters missing tons of games and Jokic pulled off an amazing carry job to the 3rd seed. We had a fossilized Millsap, massively washed :-( Gary Harris and Campazzo starting for a good chunk of the season. He sets everyone up on offense without shooting 30 times a night and being a ballhog. But hey if you base how good Jokic is by lists on /r/nba or by SAS and other very knowledgeable  people feel free to do so but the stats say otherwise."
Gary Harris and T Ross
"&gt;Which is exactly why I said ""who got paid like Dennis wants to get paid.""   So why, exactly, did you list two shooting guards when we were talking about point guards?  Because you've no idea what you are talking about, like I said.  &gt;Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton are the ones you mentioned there that 1) actually played 20 years ago, 2) actually were stars. But guess what? Those aren't the guys Dennis Schroeder plays like.  Schroder is not asking to be paid like a star.  $20M, even $25M, is not presently star money.  Gary Harris and Danilo Gallinari are over $20M, as are a whole bunch of other players.  And yes, other than the fact that Schroder is quicker, those are two players similar to how Schroder played for the Lakers last year.  I did not say that Schroder was the caliber of those players.  Consider learning how to read.  Having a similar style is not the same as being as-good.  &gt;Jason Kidd percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('02): 14%   Gary Payton percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('96): 25%   Dennis Schroeder wants more than 20% of the cap.  Again, consider learning to read.  I never even discussed Schroder's salary, or his requests.  That said, in his 9th season, Kidd signed a massive contract with an average value of $17M per, which was around 30 to 40% of the cap each year.  &gt;If you're just saying ""old school point guards"" to mean someone who plays the traditional point guard role then just say that.  I did, and for the third time, consider a remedial reading comprehension class or discontinue wasting my time with your nonsense.  &gt;So let's go through it, let's take out receipts. Here are the Eastern Conference point guards who started the most games for their teams, and you tell me which one Dennis Schroeder is most like in terms of being a traditional point guard and we'll see if they're getting 5 year deals at an average of one fifth of the annual cap if they aren't high volume low efficiency guys:  Again, learn how to read.  I never said that Schroder's contract demand -- whatever it currently is -- is reasonable.  You are arguing red herrings that you completely invented, in order to cover for your embarrassing lack of knowledge and/or accuracy.  &gt;Also, get the fuck out of here with ""Don Buse"" and ""Mo Cheeks."" Sure, if we want to go back 50 years you can talk about ""old school point guards"" then, but that's not what you said.  Again, learn how to read.  If you cannot figure out what the words ""old school"" mean, look them up.  There are dictionaries online, you don't even have to buy one.  &gt;And if you just want to say ""well he would've been better if he played a long time ago!"" Well shit, Thaddeus Young would've dominated in the 50's and 60's!  Again, learn how to read.  And also, educate yourself on basketball history.  Thaddeus Young would not be an extraordinary player in those decades, and if you knew one-hundredth as much as you think you do, you'd know that, and I wouldn't have to tell you.  &gt;So where are these ""old school point guards... who handles and distributes the ball, and guards ferociously to stop the opponent from doing the same... typically didn't shoot much, nor particularly well... were usually small and exceedingly quick, and they were fairly common until around 20 years ago"" at all  For the final time, learn how to read.  Saying something was common until around 20 years ago does not necessarily mean that it was common exactly 20 years ago.  Do yourself a favor.  Delete your reddit account, and go back to grade school."
Solid list… I had to do a double take on Harris… I thought it was Joe Harris until I realized you meant Gary Harris.
Haven’t seen too much of Gary Harris lately. He’s still like that on D?
"In no order  Pg - Holiday, Simmons, Dunn, D Murray, Lonzo  Sg - Smart, Paul George, FVV, Gary Harris, thybulle  SF - Kawhi, LeBron, Jimmy Butler, Bridges, Brooks  Pf - Giannis, AD, Draymond, OG, AG  C - Gobert, Embiid, Bam, Poetl, Capela"
TRoss + Gary Harris and 1-2 FRP (Denver and Chicago)
"Fournier &gt; Ellington, Fournier &gt; Monk, Fournier &gt; Nunn, Fournier &gt; Bazemore  Howard, Ariza, Carmelo are all WAY beyond their primes.  Gary Harris is making $20 million per season, Fournier is a more productive scorer than Harris.  What a stupid post."
"See:  Denver starting last year with Murray, Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, PJ Dozier, and Facu and having a starting backcourt of Facu and Austin Rivers come playoff time.  Depth is a wonderful thing to have."
"You know it’s the Magic. They got all those benches beat.  Cole Anthony/MCW, Suggs/RJ Hampton, T Ross/Bacon, Franz &amp; Mo Wagner and Mo Bamba/Robin Lopez  Assuming returning starters are healthy and starters are Fultz, Gary Harris, Chuma, Isaac and Wendell Carter."
"&gt;There is absolutely nothing he can do with $100 million he couldn’t do with $84 million. Invest well and that money should last generations.  The facetious answer is that he can't buy something that costs $90 million.  The real answer is that you want to get paid what you feel you're worth. Luka or Giannis would laugh if you offered them $84 for 4. Obviously, Schroder is no Luka or Giannis. But $84 for 4 is what Gary Harris has. And clearly, Schroder thinks he is more valuable than Gary Harris"
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"&gt; Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas  *screams internally*  &gt; Trading Korver for nothing  This infuriated me to no end because I loved Kyle Korver  &gt; Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne  *actual screaming*  God fucking dammnit we really traded up for Doug, then traded him away before his rookie contract was even up for a bunch of absolute garbage. And we threw in Taj Gibson as well, what the fuck  And as it turns out, it took a while but Cam Payne is actually decent, but we waived him."
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
"I feel like we could still get something for Gary Harris if he stays healthy this year, either way he’s an expiring so there’s no point in buying him out unless he wants to"
Kevin Love for sure  Dragic potentially  Gary Harris I think could be bought out
Gary Harris Task Force reporting for duty
"Yeah it was epic. Jokic played 65 out of 68 minutes in the game, which is an NBA record that might never be broken.  CJ was clutch as hell (clutch but not particularly efficient dude scored 41 points on 39 shots LOL), playing 60 minutes, with Dame just behind with 58 minutes. One day before he started fasting for Ramadan, Enes Kanter playing with a separated shoulder toughed out 56 minutes. Meanwhile Murry and Gary Harris played 55 and 50 minutes.  By 4OT, Portland's Moe Harkless cramped up after only playing 45 minutes, forcing Terry Stotts to sub in Rodney Hood who had played a mere 20 minutes in the game. Rodney literally galloped onto the court he was so fresh, and scored 7 points in a row for the Blazers to ice the win."
"If I were the Magic, I'd offer TRoss or Gary Harris for him"
"In both of those games, the Blazers won because Gary Trent Jr. and Melo over performed and put up 20+, and neither player is still with the Blazers. Also Sixers were missing Simmons and Curry in one of those games.  As for Harris, name me one player that Dame has ever played with that is better than Harris is currently."
Like just yesterday that trade for Nurkic and Gary Harris happened
"I'm assuming you are talking about Fultz, Cole, RJ and Suggs. While all of them are capable of playing point, they are all more or less combo guards. And seeing how we dont have any true SG of the future(Gary Harris and TRoss are vets that may be headed to contenders this or next year) having 4 players at 2 guard positions is more so depth than a log jam IMO"
Orlando magic have injury prone isaac/fultz and one covid~recovering mo bamba...otto left cant forget gary harris
"Maybe wishful thinking here, but would Orlando consider buying out Gary Harris?"
Price tag among other things. It's like people don't remember Gary Harris. Or Andrew Wiggins. Or Otto Porter Jr.
It's like some people don't remember Gary Harris. Or Andrew Wiggins. Or Otto Porter Jr. An overpaid Lonzo just hamstrings us.
"That's cause almost all of the important player's contracts are still from before the cap spike. People compare 20M of a Zach Lavine $20M to Gary Harris $20M.  As the time passes and new contracts are signed with everybody else, the perception catches up."
"Back when Richard Jefferson was on the Nuggets he did a road tripping podcast with Gary Harris, Mason Plumlee and Will Barton after the trade deadline that season where Barton shares that story...  Highly recommend that episode if you're a nuggets fan or just an average nba fan"
"It depends on how much the offer is. That's the problem. Hell, I'm willing to go 4/80. But I'd rather give up Lonzo than make him the new Gary Harris or Otto Porter Jr. or Andrew Wiggins."
I think Fournier is more Bogdan than Gary Harris imo
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanović - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
Right now we are should be fit over BPA. Springer is literally Gary Harris lite.  But I'm fully team bones now. If we go down we go down scoring 150 points
"Fultz is still recovering from an ACL injury and I doubt we move him while he recovers unless we get a crazy offer. Which I doubt. Let’s see how Suggs, Anthony and Hampton fit in the meantime and then figure everything out when Markelle is healthy. Someone has to end up traded eventually as we identify the best of the bunch and the player(s) to build around but I see no reason to rush Fultz out the door while he is injured tbh.   Terrence Ross and Gary Harris are the ones likely to be dealt this offseason. Ross has more value but Harris is on the last year of his deal and is better off as a role player on a contending team."
Gary harris
"No, springer was the Gary Harris replacement on the board.  Connelly said “fuck having someone who can fight through screens, more offense” and took an elite shooter.  I can’t really question TC since he’s done a great job so far. But fuck man I really wanted springer."
Is he a good defender?  I like the scoring but we need to replace Gary Harris lol
"They have so many guards now. Suggs, Hampton, Cole, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, MCW, Dwayne Bacon. I suppose the last four aren't really a part of their future though."
"Gary Harris, Hampton and Fultz all just found themselves on the trading block now."
It is strange how reference sites like bballref and wikipedia maintain that fiction with sometimes no indication that a trade happened. Like if you look up [the Bull's draft history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls_draft_history) you would think that the Bulls had a solid first round in 2014 with Jusuf Nurkic and Gary Harris.
"They also hit on Murray, MPJ, Torrey Craig, Nurkic and Gary Harris.  The nuggets have drafted extremely well. Take away jokic and they are still sitting pretty in terms of how they drafted."
Well yeah even this year the first two months he looked like belonged in the g league and not in the nba. Like you said he def showed he at least belonged in the league after those first two months and showed some promise. I just know Griff doesn’t want to give him such a big contract. Can very well be another Gary Harris type situation.
Making him the new Gary Harris would be even tougher. How many times have we seen a team overpay to keep a young guy because they don't want to lose an asset for nothing and then he doesn't live up to his new contract?
"It’s pretty prized but not that unusual. Klay, Danny Green, KCP, Gary Harris, Josh Richardson, Wes Matthews before the injury. The difference being that Lonzo is a way better passer than these guys. He’s a combo guard not a true SG."
"It's definitely the Nuggets. Their motto is ""we don't skip steps"", it's the best path to glory for any sports team, they're ""doing it the right way"".  They've been drafting players that everybody was down on, developed them, helped with their confidence and treated them like people. They've never made a huge trade to get a superstar, or even an all star. The biggest move was signing a veteran (Milsap) who helped develop the young guys. They recently traded for Gordon (another undervalued guy) and had to give up their ""oldest Nugget"" (the guy with the longest tenure, Gary Harris). Everybody was sad and it's definitely closer to football where you sometimes (especially for a smaller club) need to sell a guy who you've been developing for so long.  Their best player is from Europe (Jokić) and he's one of the most unselfish guys in the league. They got eliminated from the playoffs after their second best player (and two other best guards) got injured, Jokić had a great performance during the series, but still after the loss he said ""It's my fault"" (unlike some guys who pushed their teammates under the bus). Basketball is a team sport and that's how the Nuggets play, unlike most of the league. There haven't been any conflicts on the team since this front office has been in charge. Everybody supports everybody and they put the team in the first place.  Media never gives them any attention because they aren't a big market and Jokić isn't a guy who will say ""I'm the MVP"" after every good game (even though he is). They're constantly underdogs who wrote history last playoffs when they came back from two 3:1 deficits. They're mentally and physically tough, but they're real sportsman, who, win or lose, always praise their opponents."
We haven't replaced Gary Harris.  We need a starting level combo guard whose biggest strength is on ball defence and getting through screens
Magic about to creep up on the NBA.  So much youth already...plus the #5 and #8 pick...plus they are in position to clear a TON of cap the next 2 years.  Otto Porter off the books - $28 Mil  Gary Harris off the books after this year  -$19 Mil  T Ross off the books in 2 years - $11 Mil  (Michael Carter Williams will more than likely be gone next year too)  That brings the average age to 22 years old for 7 key guys. Then add two 19 year olds from the picks which brings it to 21 years old for 9 key guys.
"I don't think it was just half a season of good play though. He also wasn't just hot while they were out. He was runner-up for 6moy last season and played well in the Houston series. You are right though that his career has not been so favorable. I remember not really liking him in Atlanta.   I just think that he's going to get a contract around what he's looking for, especially since he didn't take the Lakers' extension offer. I think a lot of teams struggle with ball-handling, and there's a need for his skillset even if he's not the best player.  He's probably looking at the contracts of guys like Hield,  Brogdon, Gary Harris, Tobias Harris, Porzingis, Van Vleet,  Runio, Fultz, and Danuel House Jr  (pretty sure that last one's a typo lol) and thinking he can get the bag like them.   http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/\_/seasontype/4"
How much would it generate?   Like why couldnt you convince the Magic to take it on with a 1st round pick for a negative contract like Gary Harris? I'd rather have an expiring Gary Harris than nobody
It’s not the matter of keeping Lonzo. It’s the potential price tag (and maybe Rich Paul). Andrew Wiggins. Otto Porter Jr. Gary Harris. Sound familiar?
"I went to MSU. I’ll just name a few.  Brynn Forbes(transfer from Cleveland state): championship w bucks  Denzel Valentine: chillin on the bulls roster I think lol  Gary Harris: solid player.  Draymond Green: I saw his penis once. Oh yeah, he’s won a championship or two or three  Miles Bridges: probably my favorite  Jaren Jackson jr: injured all the time but really good."
Gary Harris does better than most
 Gary Harris can
"They were essentially trying to pull the same thing they did in 2014 where they traded the McBuckets pick to get both Gary Harris and Nurkic.   They always say that when the draft ""plateaus"" they'd rather have two swings than one, but yeah the ""Mitchell trade"" did fail spectacularly"
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
"Gary harris, thybulle, prime wall, dejounte murray, rondo"
"You do realise Gary Harris was highly valued before the last 2/3 years, right? He fell off hard in recent seasons."
"Literally every fanbase does, you guys were talking about Gary Harris + scraps for star players for a long ass time"
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
That’s Gary “Gary Harris” Harris to you sir.
"Murray was 7th, you might be thinking of Gary Harris who was the 11th pick."
"Any deal with Oubre would be a one year thing, with the other years being non-guaranteed.  If they include Wiseman and some of their non-guaranteed players, then Oubre wouldn't need a big deal.     Say they target Siakam, they would have to send out around $25m to match salaries.  Wiseman is set to make about $9.1m.  Gary Payton II and Alen Smailagic are around $3.7m combined.  That leaves Oubre making around $12.2m for one year.  The Warriors have two or three other guys on non-guaranteed deals, so they could drop Oubre's needed salary down another $1.8m-5.4m.      Even without Wiseman, it'd be about $21m for one year of Oubre.  That's around what Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and Garry Harris will make next year.  Yeah, it's not good, but it's not Kevin Love or John Wall bad.  Would be a legendary tax bill though for the Warriors though."
"Yes but offense is inherently more valuable, it's not 50/50.  Dwight needed an all star pg, and 3 sharpshooters, Jokic really just needs a guard defender who can get over screens (Gary Harris) and a decent defender.  Much lower maintenance."
The Gary Harris disrespect.
"I will take number 3 and Kevin Love for 5, the Denver Pick and the Chicago 23 pick plus Gary Harris and Terrence Ross please."
We were in for Gary Harris and two firsts I think
Gary Harris and bledsoe do this too. We desperately need a defender who can do this
"Jrue is insane man... I'm glad he's defense has been shown on the big stage...  I said before the series, him &amp; Gary Harris have been the only guys to consistenly lock up Book.   Respect to the bucks. Love your team, don't dislike any players man, congrats"
Look @ Gary Harris versus the Jazz last year
"Dragic, Wall, Thaddeus Young, Kemba, Gary Harris, Satoransky and Derrick Favors are probably the best candidates for the buyout market this year, guys that are pretty good veterans for a contender, but hard to trade with their contracts"
"It was a while ago, but I always hated the move to trade up for McDermott. I thought getting two guys in the late teens was gonna be awesome for the depth. I wanted Gary Harris in that draft"
Where did you find the stat? Trying to see what Gary Harris is for the magic
Hopefully Gary Harris
"Wall, Dragic, Kemba.  KLove? Gary Harris maybe?"
"Interesting case of whether or not upon review this will be credited as a rebound.   https://videorulebook.nba.com/archive/rebound-defensive-rebound-of-unsuccessful-field-goal-attempt-initial-defender-does-not-deliberately-tap-ball-to-teammate/  “An individual rebound is credited each time a player retrieves a live ball or purposely taps a live ball to a teammate immediately following a missed field goal attempt or a missed free throw attempt. No individual rebound is credited in situations where the whistle stops play before there is player possession following a shot attempt. Instead only a team rebound is credited to the team that gains possession following a stop in play. On this play, #14 in the blue uniform, Gary Harris, is credited with the defensive rebound for controlling the ball since his teammate did not deliberately tap the ball to him.”"
Gary Harris looked like a NBA player tonight
"What happened to Gary Harris, man?"
The team has been having problems since trading away Gary Harris.  I wish they would pull some trade to get Gary Harris back and add him to the rotation for defensive purposes.  I'm not sure what Orlando would want for someone like Ross but he'd be a benefit in Denver too.
"Jokic is playing really good defense right now. They miss Gary Harris, even though Gordon has brought some edge on that end.  Their perimeter defense is not great, though."
Gary Harris was elite for them. Probably would’ve made an All-Defensive team in 2019 had he played more games. Not sure if he’s the type of player though that can completely change a team’s defence.
"You clearly don't watch the games lol. Those players go off because our guards can't contain. For instance, when Gary Harris returned to the bubble to guard Donovan Mitchell, he suddenly stopped his supernova streak. When we put a good defensive guard on the other team's best guard we suddenly did great lol. Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, and Devin booker were all guarded by our 3rd stringers..."
Gary Harris was elite. Changed both the Spurs and Jazz series
"&gt;	According to a report by Windhorst, Ramona Shelburne and Dave McMenamin, the Cavaliers, Pacers and Denver Nuggets discussed a trade that would have sent Love to Denver, George to Cleveland and assets including Gary Harris and the draft's 13th pick to Indiana.  &gt;	The reporters also noted general manager Kevin Pritchard reneged when ""the Cavs were just starting to celebrate.""  &gt;	Pritchard and the Pacers moved on and flipped George to the Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis.

Probably Gary Harris. Seems like he was a fan favorite for Nugs fans but we're just kinda waiting to see what happens with him.
"By 538 Raptor, Gary Harris"
Gary Harris for Bol Bol who says no
"For Magic fans it has to be Gary Harris. Iknow were supposed to be bad rn but when all the youngins are putting in way more effort than the vet, its bad, and the guy can barely knock down an open 3. Know this one might hurt the nuggets fans’ ears but hes really been that bad and cant wait to get him off the roster"
"Gary Harris/Terrence Ross toss up right now lol.  Mo Bamba at 3rd   Solely based on on-the-court performance really, and TRoss has been playing better (by this years standards). Gary has looked awful in every game except for 1 fourth quarter"
"Gary Harris looked so promising for the Nuggets team, but went on a steep decline after his first few seasons. What happened to him? Is it the injuries that caused this decline?"
Our starting lineup has a top 3 net rating in the NBA lol. OP quite obviously doesn’t actually watch Magic games. Suggs hasn’t really been that bad on offense either for the last few games. He had some duds but those were when the team as a whole was getting obliterated. I think OP might just be a box score watcher because Bamba has been decent too. The real answer would be Gary Harris for us. Recently had his best quarter for us where he scored 5 points!
Have you guys been playing my long-time boyfriend Gary Harris?
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Every nuggets fan says yes to that in a heartbeat 😂 I know he's been bad this year but i love my guy Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
"I will trade Gary Harris for him, no questions asked whatsoever"
Shit-talked Gary Harris in a Nuggets loss when he was on the Wolves  Hope he never wins anything
"The magic starting 5 have the best net rating in the league for any lineup with at least 150 minutes.  They’re only awful when they have to play their bench guys major minutes, which we had to tonight due to Gary Harris and Cole Anthony injuries."
Cole Anthony and the corpse of Gary Harris
You meant Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
Don't forget Gary Harris.
I for one think it’s blatant tanking and should be punished by trading Cade to the Magic for Gary Harris
I swear if he doesn’t get Gary Harris’ minutes… I’ll be upset and make more comments on the internet about it
"Yes he should, Gary Harris is a shooter that can't shoot."
Gary Harris is awful on the Magic rn
Send Gary Harris home.
Gary Harris
Playing Gary Harris and Mo Wagner haha
He's really bad.  But every now and then he does something smart so you forgive him like finally staggering Cole and Suggs but he plays Gary Harris way too much.  Teams literally don't guard him.
It was so bad.  No excuses.  Harden came back in the game with 10 minutes left in the 4th.  The minute he walked to the stand should've been Cole Anthony time to match his minutes.  Also wtf was up with that random Mo Wagner 4th quarter stint.  Why is Wendell iced.  I get he was having a bad game but that hasn't stopped Mo Bamba from getting minutes in previous games or Gary Harris from playing.
Also I'm begging Mose to play his best player 38 minutes if the game is winnable.  Nash coached circles around him and didn't mess around.  41 minutes for Harden.  Cole should've played the whole fourth quarter.  When it's time to win the best players need burn and for the love of God cut Gary Harris from the rotation.
Gary harris
Gary Harris. Dude is washed and he's only 27
He used to do this every game with Gary Harris
Gary Harris would never
"Your response shows truly even though it’s mentioned a ton, how young NBA Reddit is, and how short sighted you can be. “Supreme assets”. So let’s break it down more since you’re being disingenuous.  Following 2012-2013 season. Knicks 54-28 Nuggets 57-25 Knicks go farther in a weaker East. Following that. Both have awful losing seasons. With the Knicks winning less than the Nuggets.  The biggest kicker from those “knocked” assets, is that the picks you didn’t mention, just the in your opinion bad players, turning into Gary Harris and Jamal Murray. Please educate yourself as to why the Nuggets are now threats every year. The Knicks finally made the playoffs since 2013, and Melo is a journeyman."
"He's been injured for a few years now, if not for the injuries he could have been an elite slasher and would still been part of the starting 5 of the Nuggs. Still remember his game winning shot against OKC.  Always got love for Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris."
"my bad bro. thought i read ‘young talent’ - wouldn’t have included DLo or KAT in there if so (same age as Gary Harris), so it would have come down to Ant + Okogie, McDaniels, Vanderbilt etc. which Magic’s young core is def better than"
I genuinely think if Gary Harris had never played a minute this season we would have at least 2 more wins
I remember Gary Harris being a really good Luka defender too. Just swapped one Luka stopper for another. 😭
"Trading away Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris made a lot of Nuggets fans sad even though we were really happy to get AG. Before the injuries Harris looked like he was going to be a monster. Great 3 and D guy with sick handles to boot. But then his hips came unglued and he was never the same :(."
Magic need to get the coach on board with tanking more. more RJ Hampton minutes and less Gary Harris
Gary Harris has been a special kind  of awful this game.
"This is utter shit.  Grant was okay on the Nuggets and then played amazing in the playoffs for them during the WCF run. He wasn't meant to be a scorer, he was a quality defender for them and went to the pistons to have a larger role after having some great games in the playoffs.  Millsap was okay, but again a role player, Murray is his co-star and Murray is a high quality player, again, in the playoffs for them. Their dribble handoff and pick and rolls are damn near unstoppable.  Barton and Gary Harris were actually both better before, then regressed heavily, and now Barton is having a bounce back year. He's been plagued by injuries the last two years, but he wasn't terrible before this year."
"The nuggets are considered stacked? Because Murray isn't seen as a defensive player. Prior to Aaron Gordon they had an aged Paul Millsap. Gary Harris was a solid 2 for defense, but Barton isn't. KAT has had guys specifically tailored for defensive roles alongside him, but they turn in shitty defense year after year."
"At the end of the day I think only one of them needs to get traded and then the guard rotation is fleshed out (when healthy). Let's say Harris gets traded:  PG: Cole / Fultz  SG: Suggs / whoever is left   I don't think Gary Harris has much value other than the fact that's he an expiring. Orlando seems like they're in the situation to take on some bad money but nothing's really coming to mind right now. Given the fact that Harris' offensive play has fell off a cliff, I would not be surprised if he ended up back in Denver on a vet-min.  Ross? I don't know - he may have value as a contender but salary matching etc etc"
Gary Harris
"Trade Gary Harris and Bamba for Porzingis and a couple 2nds.  Wait, just realized Porzingis had a good game, now he has way more trade value that this."
"Anecdotal but watching our guards in recent years constantly fighting lower body injuries, defense and spot up shooting seem to come back pretty easily.   It's plays to the rim that come back super slow, so I'd expect Klay to be a little less effective of a cutter but he doesn't rely on that sort of thing as much as Gary Harris or Barton did so maybe it won't effect him as much."
"They were worried about him turning into the next Gary Harris. On Chicago, his role is defined and he's good enough at to make 20 M. In New Orleans, fit wasn't there, despite the impressions that highlight reels give."
"Because what he improves at doesn't fit with Zion or Ingram. Lonzo wants to be a floor general, but can't create his own shot. And the ball needs to be in the hands of Ingram and Zion more than Lonzo. If Lonzo had stayed, he would have been the new Gary Harris with us."
"For Chicago, he's worth 20 M. For New Orleans, he'd be the next Andrew Wiggins/Otto Porter Jr/Gary Harris. It comes down to fit."
"Gary Harris, Taurean Prince, etc.   Gotta hope the LeBron effect and moving from a struggling team to the Lakers will reinvigorate a cheap wing"
You're nuts if you think we really offered that. Imagine Orlando saying no to that and taking RJ Hampton and Gary Harris.
"His decision making has been and is still bad. He’s never been great (he’s not horrible) at the rim, compared to Murray or Harris (rip), but the spots he picks are high difficulty. And whenhe inevitably drives into 3 defenders hell chuck it up or try to pass out which is so often a turnover.  What frustrates me the most about Barton is he’s actually really good if he’d play to his strengths. Great defender, moves well off ball is an decent finisher at the rim but he just forces it so much. When he’s the second, or like last night, first option the volume shines through but when he’s the 3rd/4th option he forces it.   And both him and Gary had injury issues that sapped their game. But Gary changed his game while he healed. Emphasis on D, opportune cuts, and corner threes but he basically removed iso ball. Barton didn’t and should be criticized for it"
"Malone has a serious gift of managing the human side of basketball. It's up there with Kerr, Pop, Jackson, it's really exceptionally special. There comes a point on a really good team that being able to do that is more important than the x's and o's sometimes, so the Nuggets are really blessed with a coach (and a coaching staff) who are so exceptional at developing players on and off the court.   There's a reason why every guy in that locker room will go to war for Malone, and the amount of Nuggets fans--though diminishing--who want him fired or blame him for ""problems"" is absolutely insane.   You don't go from a 33 win roster featuring Kenneth Faried and Emmanuel Mudiay, to 40 wins, to handing the franchise over to some dude chubby 21 year old 2nd rounder, to 46 wins, then to 54 wins, then to the WCF if you are not an excellent coach.   If you're able to do all that with a singular All-Star on the team in an insanely tough West off the back of accepting and building a system where your 7fter gets the ball every single time down the floor and runs the offense, you are an excellent coach.  If you're able to take the 29th defense in the league and in 4 years turn it into a top 10 defense in the league, and as we presently sit a top 3 defense in the league all while not sacrificing your offensive identity and potency, you're an excellent coach.   If you are able to churn out success after success of late round draft picks and put them into positions to succeed and become bonified NBA players, you're an excellent coach with an excellent staff.   No coach is perfect, not every out of bounds play is the best, not ever rotation makes sense from where we're sitting, but I don't know how many coaches would have been able to do all of this while still making the time to spend time with guys and their family. Fly out to Serbia multiple times to spend time with Jokic (and Gary Harris, miss you Gary), and a number of other players cities and events.   I hope he and Tim Connelly are with the Nuggets for as long as they want to stay. Hopefully decades."
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
"Harris/Ross for sure, they have both been massively negative. TRoss I think his heart is just not in it with a rebuilding team, Gary just sucks imo  TRoss is probably gonna be traded and Gary will be glued to the bench hopefully."
Why would they get Gary Harris when they have the Mitten?  It's no secret that Harris' offensive production fell off a cliff. I think it's entirely possible he ends up back in Denver on a vet min.
"And the guarantee date is before the trade deadline - buyouts don't usually happen until after the deadline since teams want to get something for them.   But also ... given what GP2 has done so far for the Warriors, and given the way he appears to be elite at filling a need for the team (attacking ball handlers), would they even see Gary Harris as an upgrade?   GP2 has looked like an all-defense level player, and his offense is good enough to get him minutes. He's been #1 or #2 in +/- in every game where he's gotten significant minutes and it's clear from watching that it's not a fluke.   I could see them cutting OPJ or Iguodala if they had a season-ending injury for the roster spot, except that Iguodala is Iguodala and they want him around. But also, by later in the season they may feel like they can replace some OPJ minutes with Kuminga minutes anyway."
Gary Harris could get bought out in Orlando.
Gary Harris was horrible his rookie year and turned it around. Obviously injuries have taken over the last few years but it happens. Let's not write off a player this young after 10 games
"Gary Harris. He was solid on the Nuggets, idk what happened"
Well there are basically no vets to play. T Ross is a traditional 6th man and Gary Harris serves 0 purpose on the team. Next up is like Mo Wagner and Robin Lopez.  We shipped out 3 starters who are all vets. Plus issac and Fultz are hurt. Cliffords job was to win games and keep his job. Mosley’s job is to develop young guys and play them
"At the beginning of the season we were trying to do that somewhat, making 3-4 subs at a time in an effort to keep the starting group together, but after giving up several 18-0 runs the moment the bench came in we have since moved to trying to keep one of Cole/Suggs and one of Bamba/WCJ on the floor at all times.  It's mostly Terrence Ross and Gary Harris have been totally checked out. TRoss has never been a great defender, but he's barely shooting the ball now as well and constantly turning it over. Gary was supposed to be great defense some offense and he's been horrifically negative on both ends. The other team is pretty much guaranteed to go on a run when Harris comes in the game - this was Gary's best game of the season and he was still -4 in a game we won by 7. At their current pace, TRoss and Harris will break the record for worst total plus minus in a season."
"RJ Hampton is nice, Gary Harris is a vet"
Gary Harris played good defense on Mitchell yet again? Haven't watched the game but can see big minutes played.
"I simply don’t have the energy to have an extended discussion about why it’s wrong to dismiss MPJ right now when it’s his first big stint with back issues since he first started playing for us a couple years ago. There has been more than enough fruitful discussion about why the contract was justified in the eyes of the Nuggets  Also, Gary Harris hasn’t been on the Nuggets since February since he was traded for Aaron Gordon. Gary Harris is in Orlando."
"I mean, he’s right. I love watching the Nuggets. That run in 2020 with Murray going nuts was so much fun to watch   But he’s right. There’s a reason teams passed on him and now Jokic has to try and keep a team of Gary Harris and Campazzo afloat somehow"
Lol Gary Harris. What did he think would happen there?
"The problem is that the shot was pretty much the only thing he had going for him and what got him the max contract. His basketball IQ is questionable to say the least, his one on one defense is still awful, even though his defensive numbers are benefiting from good team defense this year, and his handles suck ass, so he's still unable to create for himself. If his shot isn't falling, he's pretty much useless on the court.  Must suck for other players on the roster who have done more in the Nuggets uniform than Mike did (Will, Monte) and who are all contributing knowing they all have to rear a dude who was handed a max just like that (with an option to go supermax), while being paid of fraction of what he'll be making. Meanwhile, Mike remains isolated from the rest of the team because of his vaccine status, which apparently wasn't affected by the fact that he'll make close to 200 mil in the next 5 years.   I'm getting serious Gary Harris vibes all over again, as Gary also had comparable numbers and splits before he git his contract (18 pts/game with shooting splits of 49/40/83) while also being able to play excellent D. At least Gary was likeable and wasn't given the same contract as Jokic/Murray, and was never mopping when not getting enough shots or not getting his shots to fall.  I expect him to get better when Murray comes back, as he'll get more space on offense, but it still sucks when your max player can only operate well as the third option on the team. Hopefully that contract doesn't look as abysmal when Jokic's contract comes up for renewal, because the team will look handcuffed otherwise."
I miss him doing this with Gary Harris. 3-4 years ago he always did this every game with that guy.
Shoutout to Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
I was worried before the season that Gary Harris would take to many minutes from our young guys. But clearly Gary needs the playing time to develop more than them.
If Lakers had assets Gary Harris and Terrence Ross could be the way out but I doubt ORL is selling low on Ross for THT and some low value draft picks
"Gary ""Harris"" Harris."
"Mo Wagner, Gary Harris, and Terrence Ross shouldn’t be locked in for Orlando"
We'll take him for gary harris and a SRP
Ross is the eldest player and soul of that team tho. I don’t think they’ll trade him. Gary Harris yes.
Gary Harris (20M expiring) and Ross (10M this year and one more  year). For KP and picks... i dont love it for the magic but what do you think?
Gary Harris with the -23 🔥🔥🔥
"hoping to no more Gary minutes for ya.  Need to see Magic winning more so we can get Banchero, and Gary Harris is a HUGE liability to that"
"When he comeback, Gary Harris will lose minutes, right?"
Gary Harris might be the worst player on the court tonight.
Gary Harris was very good too before being dealt
Yeah I'm not surprised because of his [laundry list](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gary-harris-player-injuries) of lower body injuries.
Orlando is probably more interested in moving Gary Harris. 20M expiring.
"&gt;unless injuries hit.  How can you just gloss over injuries. One injury can take away a players athleticism and halt their progress. Gary Harris for example was a great defender, then he got hit with injuries and is a borderline rotation player. Look at Jonathan Isaac. Anything can happen, guaranteeing a rookie will eventually win DPOY after a few games is ridiculous. There are plenty of elite defenders who don't even make all-defense every year"
Trade you guys Bol Bol for Gary Harris back?
Gary Harris did too.
When does Gary Harris return??
Mpj starting over injured Gary Harris right?
"Okc didn’t get a prospect for cp3 however no offense to ty Jerome.  It was a 1st, decent expiring(oubre) and slightly negative contract(Rubio) which they turned along with 2 late 1sts into a bad expiring and a mid 1st.  Add on even though cp3s on a bad contract and older, he was a little better than Lowry is now and has 2 years left.  I read on realgm that a team that trades for Lowry can’t resign him now and that’s a huge deal.  Think raptors fans on here are asking for a bit too much looking for a first and a good prospect unless the other salary is bad.    I’m talking like Gary Harris as the bad contract Barton as expiring and a 1st and Denver still is only attaching like bol bol.  Realgm trade board(suggest people check it out) also threw out stuff like just Lowry for Drummond and a prospect/1st and rarely include maxey in any Danny green deal."
"Transferable picks that turn into unprotected picks are fine.  Salary matching is an issue, but there are plenty of good teams with players who can be used for salary matching. Denver has Gary Harris. LAL has Schroder and KCP.  IDK if Utah would do anything for Lowry but they have plenty of desirable mid-range guys. Portland would be tricky, but they don't really need Lowry anyway. Spurs ahve Mills and Gay.  Virtually every team has better options than the clippers trash-tier offer."
"i doubt there will be a huge bidding war honestly.  not because Lowry's not good but because the teams that want him won't be super flexible in what they can give up. like Clippers would definitely want him, but the contracts they need to send out are multi-year and hefty (Morris, Beverley) and they don't have firsts or intriguing young players to trade. Dallas can do it with THJ and James Johnson but if they don't want to give up THJ then it gets murky - Powell is on a long term deal, they need Kleber etc - Nets can't do it without one of DAJ or Joe Harris that's not happening.  imo the teams with a viable path to trade for Lowry are Sixers, Nuggets and Heat. Nuggets can do Gary Harris+Millsap (unless Raptors say absolutely no multi-year deals), Heat can do two of Dragic/Iggy/Olynyk/Leonard, Sixers can do Green/Scott/Ferguson.   it's possible i'm forgetting or not considering some other team but those seem to be the likely candidates."
Gary Harris is an elite defender. Playoffs showed it.
Gary Harris is very fun player and shows up in the playoffs!
"it's a shame what injuries did to Gary Harris, would have been one of the top two way SGs in the league smh."
"We have 30+ million tied up in Gary Harris and will Barton. We might be able to get off of Barton’s contract for some team in need of a secondary ball handler or someone to lead the second unit, but I don’t think we will be able to find someone willing to take on 19 million for Gary Harris."
what the hell happened to Gary Harris. Is this year 3 now?
Man what happened to Gary Harris. He is so bad
Would you like a Gary Harris or will Barton?
Gary Harris
Gary “Hary Garris” Harris
Gary Harris and Will Barton are the death of this team
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"I would go Gary Harris, he is more versatile. Bev is great man to man. Gary can run around screens, and also guard man to man pure guards. Bev gets in foul trouble too much too"
"The rest of the Jazz are playing great, meanwhile Gary Harris has been dog water."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
"Gary Harris is an elite defender, he gets paid for a reason  Edit: yea it’s become clear to me you’re basing this whole post on how many points players score. Draymond doesn’t put up any points himself but he’s huge for the overall offence of the warriors. It’s no coincidence they were garbage this season until he returned from injury. Everyone knows about his defensive prowess too"
Gary Harris
Gary Harris is better at guarding pure guards.
"Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, 2 1st rounders and 2 pick swaps for Beal would be I think a great deal for us."
Gary Harris if he's considered young. Our other young guys haven't played more than 10 mins yet
"Lets me 100% honest here, Jerami Grant was never going to have a fucking legacy.  Say he stays in Denver and they win, ""oh you mean the guy who played with Joker, Jamal and Porter Jr?""  and I bet most people would answer ""you talking about Gary Harris?"""
Gary Harris  Murray  Barton (better last 2 games though)
"Gary Harris, Trae Young, Nerlans Noel, Hassan Whiteside"
I agree. They made a mistake letting go of Nurkic and Beasley. They should of kept Beasley over Gary Harris in my opinion

Good luck getting to where you want to go with a Simmons and Gary Harris backcourt.   You guys wildly overrate defense. They don't need defense to the point where they trade one of their best offensive players to get a player that can't make a shot that isn't in the paint. They'd get farther trading Murray in a package for Beal than they would trading Murray for Simmons.
If he replaces the Gary Harris role it’s not gonna detract much from shooting and will add to everything else
"I think the Jazz' biggest issue right now is we have no one that can defend athletic guards. We match up terribly with guys like Lillard, Murray, and so on. Royce is a great defender against forwards, but can't stay in front of a guard to save his life. Then you have Mitchell and Conley who both just can't cut it either.   We really need someone like a Gary Harris or Jerami Grant."
"The thing is I doubt MPJ actually goes anywhere. He's an interesting trade piece but I don't think him combined with the less than ideal trade assets from Denver (Will Barton is alright but Gary Harris tanked his trade value) would get you anything close to Simmons.   Considering Denver's small market status and lack of real assets, the best thing they can hope for that MPJ turns into a star.  I wonder if they're in the trade mill for Oladipo though."
because MPJ is already out with covid and we had a bad start where we're just getting back to .500. Also Jamal hasn't been that bad he's just not shooting well. 17/9/6/2 is still good numbers. When Gary Harris and MPJ both get back I wouldn't be surprised if Jamal takes a week off or something.
anyone know why Gary Harris didn't play last 2 games
Gary Harris is out for an undisclosed reason.
"Gary Harris is missed. Murray can’t defend Cameron Payne, let alone Curry."
I feel pretty confident Curry and Wiggins will torch the Nuggs because Gary Harris is out and Denver has no good wing defenders
"I'm in a similar boat where I hate the Nuggets, but have a soft spot for Jokic, Murray, Gary Harris, Millsap, Craig, MPJ, and Monte Morris"
"&gt; They can - there's nothing that says Houston needs to only take expiring money.  Their broke ass owner means they can’t take anything other than expirings. John wall, Christian wood, daneul house, and Eric Gordon alone costs them over 80 mil. They need to sign 10 more players to have a full roster next season. They can’t afford 20 million to Gary Harris.  &gt; He's been a 20 ppg scorer this year so far, even if his defense has fallen off, teams have traded late 1sts for less.  The Celtics don’t even need another guard. You gonna start him over Kemba, brown, or smart in the playoffs? Hell no. Philly trade you mentioned seems somewhat possible. Would be a bad idea for Philly unless they’re  convinced dipo will win them a chip this season, which I’m not."
"&gt;I don’t see them getting any meaningful assets for dipo  I mean if I were the Sixers looking to a compete for the chip I'd rather have Dipo than Danny Green. Danny Green + a FRP gets the deal done imo.  It's confirmed he didn't want to stay in Indiana but there's nothing out there saying he only wants to sign in Miami.  If I'm Denver I'm also offering up Gary Harris + a first.  Shit, if I'm Boston I'm also offering up the TPE money from the Hayward trade + a first."
Is he better than Gary Harris on defense
"Gary Harris + a first rounder or 2 depending on how good he looks by the deadline, possibly add Bol Bol or Hampton too."
Gary Harris + a pick?  Harris has an extra year left on his deal so cheap-o Tilman probably needs a sweetener to agree
"I don’t think MPJ, Gary Harris, + a pick is good enough for harden, they’d have to give Murray + more picks and I don’t think Denver’s gonna completely mortgage their future for him. This is a short term move that doesn’t fuck them up in the long term.  Also, I think Kyrie is a better fit next to Jokic and Murray than Harden."
"&gt;MPJ + Gary Harris and a first for Kyrie  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;pennies on the dollar  One of these things is not like the other.   Granted, it's still a big discount, but it's not nothing, either."
"but he's clearly not a terrible defender either who will single-handedly tank your defense unless you put the all-defense first team around him. it's not like Nuggets defense gets so much better when you take Jokic off the floor.   there's a difference between ""perfect roster"" and ""optimal roster"". Denver's best perimeter defenders are what, Gary Harris, 35 year old Millsap and PJ Dozier? someone fill me in if i'm forgetting anyone. that's so far off of ""optimal"".   i'm not saying you have to get Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons and Giannis to make that defense work. just don't put him out there with MPJ's and 5'10 point guards you brought in from Europe for some reason."
"I'm like, is this something literally anyone is. infused about? all they have is Gary Harris and Paul Millsap and SORT OF Barton. everyone else is a negative defender for their position or atrocious. clearly defense is their problem. they're out here looking like the old Kiki nuggets back in the day"
"MPJ, Gary Harris, and Will Barton to make the contracts work. Probably need to be 2 or 3 1sts as well."
nah that was 100% gary harris
Most of the people that talk about em don’t so I appreciate that. He’s been passing up open shots and doesn’t take it to the hole anymore. His aggressiveness is way down which is why I suspect he’s actually hurt. It’s a constant talking point in their losses because when we need him to make the big shots we only have Jokic to rely on. Our D was very bad at the beginning of the season but it’s mostly speedy/shooting guards that tear us up. Which is supposed to be Gary Harris’ duty
"Gary Harris out for personal reasons, Bol is not getting the start over him"
"&gt;if it was such a common capability then tmr we should see a Gary Harris highlight of this.  Bro I literally just explained why it wasnt so common...You have no common sense and you cant read? Lmao. Also Gary Harris does not always have the ball in his hands and is not a pass first player like Jokic, Lebron, Ball, etc. Those players are always looking to make that pass and always have the ball in their hands. They have more opportunities to do so. James Harden also has all the opportunity and is capable of making that pass, but we dont see full court passes from him because hes a score first player, and the Rockets play halfcourt basketball more than transition. James Harden can make that pass. Gary Harris can make that pass.   If you think an NBA player cant accurately throw a ball 90 feet, you're being delusional."
"Use some common sense? Common sense says most players cant make that pass! Thats all im tryna say bruh, that if it was such a common capability then tmr we should see a Gary Harris highlight of this. Like every time you see this pass made, its one of the best passers in the NBA making it (Lebron, Jokic, maybe Hardens done it once or twice?). Hmmm i wonder why..."
"nuggets sub chessmasters think lavine's worth gary harris ""and bench pieces"" last i checked"
"Oh you’re depleted, no miles plumbee, Grant, mpj,  regression from Milsap, Barton, Gary Harris etc. Moved down a tier"
I've been a huge Malik Beasley fan since he filled in for (I think) an injured Gary Harris a few years ago in Denver. His game reminds me of Bradley Beal before Beal started playing off the dribble. I think Malik can have a Beal-esque jump and imo will average 25-27ppg one day (not this year).
Gary Harris is harder to move with his contract though
How dare you disrespect Gary “Gary Harris” Harris like that?
"Lowry &amp; OG for MPJ, Gary Harris, and whatever salary shit"
"For what it's worth, Jokic turned Gary Harris into a near 20 points per game guy until Jamal developed.  You guys finally seem to have a direction, and I definitely look forward to relevant Knicks teams. How awesome it would be for the NBA to re-engage that market"
Probably.  A true 3 and D guy would be nice.  Not very many out there with any kind of real availability though.  Also having Gary Harris of 4 years ago would be great.
Gary Harris shining against the Knicks
"Didn't he help a lot on offense, esp during the beginning of seasons while Jokic would usually still be working himself back into shape? After he got hurt and missed the bubble, he hasn't looked anything like his old self. It's not like he was a great player before that, but both he and Gary Harris were more reliable offensive options before their injuries. At least Harris still has defense."
"Gary Harris, Will Barton, Bol Bol, 3 firsts and a pick swap"
"I'm just wondering what the hell is going on w/ the Nuggets? Jokic's insane play should be making the game easier for his teammates. I guess MPJ being in COVID protocol forever b/c he refuses to quarantine properly, plus Will Barton thinking he's the shit, and Gary Harris losing his shooting will do that to you. Millsap's still pretty good but old af. And losing longbois Craig and Grant didn't seem to help.  Hopefully Monte Morris and PJ Dozier take a huge leap this year. I'd really like Jokic to win MVP this season, or at least come in 2nd."
"He's still getting paid 20m  Nuggets would look something like this - Murray (30m) + Jokic (30m) + Gary Harris  (20m) + Grant (20m) + Barton (15m) + Monte Morris (10m)   You don't have any money to sign JaMychal Green and I'm no salary cap expert I think you have to let Paul Millsap go if you want to talk about the future with MPJ and potentially the possibility of an extension the next year, Gary Harris by then would become a FA though, so you can choose to resign or let him leave in FA because you probably can't pay him as much as he would like.  From in the 2020 season advanced stats show the Nuggets offense and defense was better when he was off the court, but idk - check in 2 months time to see if he's still ballin."

The corpse of gary harris whos declined every year and a pick
Good game as any to fix Gary Harris 3 point shot. Shot 13% before this game and is shooting 5/8 today
"What baffles me is that the Nuggets could have resigned him if they found a way to move Gary Harris, who should not be completely unmovable. The playoffs kind of showed that Grant was very important while Harris is just not needed."
Gary harris likes getting posted up
"I don't mind getting blown out in a game like this, but I do mind losing because this is the game that Gary Harris decided to show up to.  What the hell"
Of course this is the Gary Harris game lol     Also can we get a whistle
Gary Harris found a chance to unwash himself
So Gary Harris can play offense again?
Gary harris hitting 3s is making me sick
gary harris is really out here saving the nuggets.
Gary Harris revenge game
People told me Gary Harris couldn’t play offense for the past 2 years. So of course this is the game he’s gonna be on fire lol
"We’re playing with 7 guys and Gary harris remembers how to play basketball, wtf"
Jokic keeps surprising me that man Ia a chunky basketball deity and if we had s better record I'm sure he could be mvp. Campanazzo has also been a great surprise he brings a lot of energy defensively and has some of the sickest passes i have seen in a while.  Disappointed pretty much everyone else from the team Jamal murray has struggled offensively more than usual i don't expect him to be bubble murray but at least 20 consistently. Will barton last year was one of our best players and now looks washed in some games and we haven't gotten back his defense. Mpj is good at basketball but a moron and is suspended for not following the covid guidelines for about two weeks. Gary harris is not being phenomenal.
"Lou Williams is one of the worst defenders in the league and is a undersized 2 guard most effective offensively against bench units. Reggie Jackson is also an undersized 2 guard who isn't that great on offense who's only a good catch and shoot three point shooter and is a subpar defender. Gary Harris is still better than both of them, Harris is one of the best guard defenders in the league and can still at least finish at the rim offensively even though he can't shoot like Lou or Jackson."
Jackson was literally starting before traded mate. And we have Gary fucking Harris starting. Lou is so much better
"the great minds of the nuggets subreddit offer the bulls gary harris ""and bench pieces"" of their choosing take it or leave it"
"&gt; And I think we can somewhat see the defensive impact of the Nuggets not having him anymore.  The irony of the Nuggets situation is that he went to the Pistons even tho Nuggets matched b/c he wanted more offensive touches. Who knew he'd probably be getting more this season (unless Malone were to be stubborn for no reason) because MPJ doesn't trust science enough to stay out of COVID protocol, Will Barton sucks, and Gary Harris can't seem to regain his shooting touch. Had he stayed, he'd probably be the most reliable 3rd option, and maybe 2nd option on some nights when Murray's having an off-night. With the amount of dimes Jokic is dishing out he would've been feasting cuz these other fools can't score or in MPJ's case, can't even play b/c he'll probably be stuck in COVID protocol purgatory forever."
I think it’s a perfect fit but trading MPJ for Siakam feels like selling low. It might be worth it though if you include Gary Harris’ contract which has borderline negative value at this point
Gary Harris does not look enthused about having to play OT.
We'll allow you to have Gary Harris
No Gary Harris?

Using a 40 attempt qualifier:  Caris LeVert 138 from 145  Aron Baynes 37 from 45  Aaron Holiday 46 from 51  Cedi Osman 106 from 105  **Killian Hayes 32 from 47**  Markelle Fultz 103 from 104  Cole Anthony 69 from 76  Michael Carter-Williams 36 from 44  Devonte Graham 80 from 99  Ish Smith 42 from 46  Gary Harris 56 from 61  Kelly Oubre 84 from 101  JJ Redick 49 from 55  Dillon Brooks 129 from 132  Tyus Jones 59 from 63  So Killian Hayes at 0.68ppa is the least efficient shooter in the league so far this season
"Malone needs to work his rotations. Understood that MPJ is out tonight, but we got -15 Gary Harris playing on Maxi Kleber late in the 4th into OT."
"Gary Harris is also 6'4 vs Doncic who is 6'8. Luka feasts on smaller defenders, he's made Jrue Holiday look silly multiple times"
"Gary Harris did not do a good job on Dončić, I’ll say it"
Gary Harris is too small to be guarding Luka. He doesn’t have that length
Gary Harris lowkey looks like Sam Eagle
That’s my Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
I want to see that Gary Harris move again
Gary Harris needs to sit man. It breaks my heart but he is just awful right now
"&gt; They really aren’t that good lol. They aren’t beating the lakers or the clippers  In they playoffs? That's a high bar for being ""good."" If we're talking about regular season, Clippers have shown they're still mortal (Mavs blowout, vulnerability during back-to-backs). Only the Lakers are coasting to the best record.  Nuggets as of now don't look like a better team than last year. They lost 2 wing players, idk what's going on w/ Gary Harris (and to a lesser extent Barton), MPJ got COVID as he was starting to get into a groove, and their backup center seems worse than Plumlee. It seems like only Jokic has maintained or exceeded his great form."
"They're clearly speaking Spanish as Campazzo is walking down the hall. They only switch to English when he's talking to the camera and when talking to Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
"I said off hand, Mike Conley only has this year left. Gary Harris is like a 5 million dollar player now making 20, John Wall is way better than all of them. wiggins was probably 6th in my mind."
"But mike conleys making more money than Dlo. Are you saying mike Conley is better than danglo russell? Also, why is Gary Harris here over John wall or wiggins"
Isn't this what Gary Harris suffered?
"Off hand : Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Gary Harris, D’Angelo Russell,"
"he's a good defender. Nuggets are 15th in defense or exactly average with Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, MPJ, Will Barton, Facu, 36 year old paul millsap and Jamichael Green playing most of the minutes. Jokic is literally the best defeder on the Nuggets other than Gary Harris who has barely played this year."
"Oh yeah I'm not trying to say Embiid wasn't the front runner, just that as good as he was, Jokic was still beating him in a whole bunch of offensive and impact categories, which is nuts cause Embiid is (was?) having one of the best offensive seasons for a center in 20 years. Like, at least there was a statistical debate there and Embiid having the better record put him ahead.   With lebron, the is no statistical debate. He has, according to everyone, the deepest team in the league. They raced to a top record while having the best tandem in the league. Bron is playing fantastic D but they are stacked with good defenders too. Even now with a bunch of dudes out, they have multiple defenders that would be the nuggets best perimeter defender (with Gary Harris out). And they are still only a couple games better than the nuggets. Meanwhile jokers numbers absolutely trounce lebron"
"Harden is clearly team cancer, trade him to the nuggets for gary harris and a 2nd."
Gary Harris for Gordon is... kinda okay? That Magic team has no clue what it's doing.
"Jokic also doesn't play with an all time defender like Draymond. Our best defenders are what, Gary Harris who has been out half the season, Facu Campazzo who is 5'9 and that's pretty much it."
"no clue tbh. Gary Harris for Aaron Gordon swap works salary wise, and we could attach a few picks to that as well."
"It's more that all of our perimeter defense was hurt. Which is why the minute Gary Harris returned, the series flipped"
"It depends, but perimeter defense has been a huge problem for the Nuggets the past few years, especially because Gary Harris has been hurt a lot. Every center is going to look worse when they’re starting next to guys like Jamal Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ. If Jokic had someone like Ben Simmons, PG or Kawhi on the court with him his numbers would look a lot better."
"When people compare  Embiid's defensive stats with Jokic, it seems like they forget that one of them is surrounded by defensive stalwarts such as Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, etc, and backed up by Dwight Howard, while the other has... Gary Harris. If he's healthy that is.. and is backed up by Hartenstein, or the #1 on the list JMG. When  perimeter defenders can't contain their players, the center will obviously have a hard time stopping 1 on 2s, or even 1 on 1 when dealing with quicker guards. It's not the same when you're defending the post against off balance guards due to good perimeter defense, and going 1 on 2 and having to choose between picking up a foul or not contesting a layup..."
Gary Harris
"Gary Harris is the better defender, and gets the more difficult matchups."
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
This is exactly wrong lol. Drop coverage is where he struggles becuse he lacks the foot speed to play in space with rim rollers or fast guards going downhill to the rim. Hedging is where he has more success because he can use his bbiq and fast hands to get steals/deflections/force the pass away from the pnr action.  The reason we got punished against Utah is because   1.	our two best perimeter defender in Gary Harris and will Barton weren’t available so we were just allowing penetration constantly. Remember earlier when I said athletic rim runners and guards getting downhill are bad for Jokic? Yeah Donovan and Rudy fit the bill lol 2.	MPJ was the one getting most often hunted in those actions since he’s so young and inexperienced as a defender. Last night was his 82nd career NBA game and he missed all of college. Dude has a long way to go to get his nba defensive iq where it needs to be   We did still play some drop coverage against the jazz because we kept trying to change stuff up to see if anything would work. The solution was basically “wait until Gary Harris is healthy.” So we did. And we won.
"What’s homer about the following facts:  * Nuggets about average drtg  * Jokic one of the best players in the NBA for generating steals+deflections  * Gary Harris and Millsap have missed considerable time  * Murray, MPJ and Morris are poor defenders.   Every one of those statements is just a fact."
"Nuggets have an average drtg and Jokic is one of the best players in the entire NBA for generating steals and deflections. Our best two defenders in Gary Harris and Millsap have missed a ton of time- you really think a team starting Jamal murray, MPJ and Monte Morris is gonna have a good defense? Jokic is clearly not the problem there."
Jerami Grant basically 🤦‍♂️. Or 2016-18 Gary harris 😔
Lol you guys really have no idea how inconsistent Denvers line ups have been do you? Mpj missed 3 weeks in Jan. Gary Harris (our best defender..) has missed over half he season.  Jamychal green missed 15 games and Paul Millsap came back yesterday after 3 weeks off.  Outside of Portland I can't think of any team that's getting screwed worse from Injuries/covid.  Also calling Denver the 5th seed is funny. Until Lakers won their game yesterday they were the 4th seed. Let's not act like they're miles ahead. It's a close race
"&gt;If Jokic is able to get a top 3 seed, then there's an argument for him.   Oh so it's ""Most Valuable Player on a Top 3 seed"" award?   Jokic has been doing all of this with a rotating cast of heavy injuries.  They didn't have Milsap [starting 4] or JaMychal Green [backup 4] vs the Bucks [and have been without Gary Harris for a long time] and still whooped them.   Also, the thing so many people miss, is that without a superstar sidekick [or like I said, even an All-Star sidekick], the 3rd/4th/5th/6th best players on the team become even more important when the 2nd isn't a superstar. MPJ, Harris, Milsap, Green, and Dozier have all missed significant time. Murray was visibly playing hurt most of the beginning of the year too [and his numbers show it - - he's been much better of late]."
"Nuggets are still missing a starter, Gary ‘Gary Harris’ Harris."
Rookie Gary Harris was unwatchable.
"Seriously, MPJ and Gary Harris plus picks for Lavine is a bargain. He’s a proven talent and now all star who is the same age as Jokic. MPJ’s trade value has dropped since the beginning of the season too."
"Nope nice try, Gary Harris was out and Murray was battling injuries. It lead to Mitchell averaging MJ numbers, still lost though lol"
"To the Nuggets for MPJ, Gary Harris and 2 or 3 first rounders"
I always get George Hill and Gary Harris mixed up
"curry for gary harris and will barton, who says no /s"
He just plays idk obviously we are not privy to all the secrets but Jamal just plays uhm he is the attitude the fire in Denver jokic will always perform we will ride and die with Murray but that's just who Jamal is he's fucking tough we bitch about Gary Harris being injured but both Jamal and jokic have barely ever missed games we r lucky to have them
"&gt; Gary, PJ, Green and Sap have all missed close to or more than double digit games.   Right, but that's one starter and then your bench players. Imagine if Murray and Jokic were both hurt. Plus you still have injuries from guys like Harris. Where would your team be right now?  And like I said, we only started getting credit for those injuries because things turned around. Without the recent 4-game win streak we'd be getting the exact same complaints we were getting 2 weeks ago, the same complaints Murray has been dealing with.  It's not a small market matter, injuries don't get taken seriously until the player is either healed back up or run out of the league. Look at Paul George, Russell Westbrook, etc etc.   Also, as much as Boston has a big internal market, we're really not a big market team on the national stage. Half our roster is unknown for the national commentators."
Draymond for Gary Harris who says no
"i thought that was for gary ""gary harris"" harris"
"Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray  MPJ  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Golbert   Bench:  Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Melo, Josef Nurkic  Solid."
Beal if you're lucky but I think you'd have to throw more FRPs in or one of the rookies.  Gary Harris has no real trade value other than being a fat expiring next season.
"Hasn't MPJ shown a lot more promising results at the 4 versus the 3?  I know MPJ playing the 4 was a result of Paul Millsap and JaMychal Green being injured but Millsap's washed anyways. No reason that MPJ couldn't be the starting 4 for the rest of the season next to Barton.  I kind of figured that Gary Harris would be the most expendable since he continues to fall off a cliff offensively but I know his defense is valuable. He's way overpaid though and wouldn't have any trade value.   Either way, losing Grant sucked. Barton's too undersized for the 3."
Not sure why we'd want Gary Harris like at all? Or Bogdan for that matter as much love as I have for him. We're looking to give Tyrese a starting spot.
"Why would Boston's package be any better than a team like Denver's for Barnes?  Wouldn't they rather shift from Barnes onto a younger contract that actually be an asset?  I just don't know why Sacramento would take Williams/Langford some late pick when they could get someone like Gary Harris.  Or if they'd rather reset and free up cap space for this summer for some reason, find the team with the expiring that wants a longer term asset locked up over the guy they have walking (maybe like a Fournier or a Hardaway Jr.)  Hell, if they really want to, they could just get Bogdan back for him, but both teams would have to admit they fucked up lol."
"I'd be fucking ecstatic if they offered Gary and a first. He would be a perfect guard to add in with Fox and Hali, I just don't see Denver parting with Harris though."
"Denver has the young talent and the salary to make it work, something along the lines of Gary Harris, Bol Bol, and a first? Maybe throw in RJ Hampton or Campazzo to sweeten it if needed."
"Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris"
"Can you guys please trade Lowry to the Nugs for Gary Harris, RJ Hampton and 1st round pick/BOL BOL?"
"You should be able to kind of hide them though with guys like Roco and Nurkic, and don’t get me wrong the front office is to blame too. There’s not nearly enough defensive minded role players on this team. A guy like Gary Harris would have been a better fit for this team than Norman Powell imo"
gary harris enjoying a pina colada right now
What happened to Gary Harris. He was kind of good no?         Edit: webey gif
Yeah its a lot easier to defend the blazers when they have fucking Aminu on the court vs 5 good offensive players like they have now. Jokic has no chance guarding the PNR against dame with the guards he has. If they had gary harris maybe its a different story
"Aaron Gordon trade would’ve been so much helpful against any other team than us tbh. Losing Gary Harris combined with all your other injuries is brutal when it comes to guarding Dame, CJ, and Norm"
Gary Harris was there previously. His replacement PJ Dozier is injured

"Mike "" Michael ""Don't call me Mike ""Gary Harris"" "" Malone"" Malone"""
"He'll be an UFA so if they had no intention to re-sign him, might as well get something in return. Same thing for Matt Thomas.  They have FVV and Gary Trent Jr as their guards of the future and two promising rookies in Malachi Flynn and Jalen Harris, two players who will be cheaper. They also have Paul Watson.   Overall the Raptors made 3 good trades at the deadline. We'll see what the Kings do with Davis, but if they end up re-signing him without overpaying him it'll be a good trade for them too.   My nomination for the worst trade of recent years is the Lakers trading Zubac for Muscala. Just, why?"
The Aaron Gordon trade is so interesting. You get him to specifically defend Kawhi and Luka and LeBron and he’s great at that. But you gave up Gary Harris and RJ not knowing you’d be playing the one team in the west that has no wings that need Gordon’s specialties but have 3 guards. Like if you could travel back in time knowing this series is happening and you don’t make the trade and you have Gary and RJ on Dame and CJ I think this series is actually a pretty easy win for the Nugs. But if they win and go against the Lakers you’d want Aaron Gordon so I don’t know. Just a weird thing.
"We have argued about this before and I don’t really have the energy to hash it out again.   But the tl;dr is that perimeter protection is important. Jokic’s playoff defense was fine last year. You notice how suddenly the jazz offense was no longer blowing us out as soon as Gary Harris got back? Almost like when you’re missing 2 guards (whether it’s Barton and Harris or Barton and dozier) it’s going to fuck up a lot of what you do. Specifically your pnr defense.  If you want to see the idealized version of the nuggets, watch the one week where we had all 5 starters healthy and we were able to switch basically everything. Murray-Barton-mpj-Gordon-Jokic is beautiful basketball on both ends.  Jokic isn’t a perfect defender. But you can scheme around his weaknesses and fit him into a good defense. It’s like saying Giannis or Ben simmons are shit offensive players because they don’t have a jump shot. You can still scheme around those weaknesses and both are still offensive forces."
Denvers defense looking like their bubble defense before Gary Harris showed up
"10/10 times you take Aaron Gordon, but man if this Dame stretch doesn't show how important a Gary Harris level defender is to the Nuggets"
Missing 3 of your top 4 guards against a guard dominant team will do that.  Doubly painful since we traded two guards (Gary Harris and RJ hampton) in the deal for AG to get more large wings for the LA teams and got matched up with the smallest team in the west
"Trade Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris and a curse gonna form."
Wtf I would’ve put money on Gary Harris being on this list
Brogdons got the Gary Harris energy
"Otto Porter Jr is probably gone, and most of the random injury fill-ins we signed, so Chasson Randle, Ignas Brazdeikis, Donta Hall, Sindarius Thornwell. Strictly speaking, Mo Wagner is in that category, but I think we'll keep him.   I think we also probably will trade one of Gary Harris or Terrence Ross at some point."
"CJ is still a huge threat though. Gary Harris locked down Dame pretty well in the series two years ago, but CJ came through and is the main reason they beat us."
Picks we traded were nurkic and Gary Harris.   Just looked - that was a ton of mid to late talent. I stopped watching the nba in 2016. Watched 70+ bulls game a year from 97 til then. I believe in Zach and coach but man our picks have not aged well the last decade.
"lmao yeah I'll go ahead and roll with that matchup.   I know he's a solid defender but I'll take Campazzo vs Gary Harris, Jrue, Klay, etc etc.  Please and thank you"
Yeah Gary Harris was really good at defending Dame but he's obviously not on the roster anymore
"Idk we already compromised spacing with AG since we absolutely needed him, whoever replaces Barton in the starting lineup needs to shoot well from 3 and not be a liability defensively. Gary Harris was perfect for that but his shooting started to suck. Hopefully Dozier gets his 3p% up and we eating Gucci"
Every active player to have ever worn the number 12 for Orlando will be playing in the same game!  Dwight Howard  Tobias Harris  Gary Clark  Sindarius Thornwell
"if Gary harris ever leads the magic to the finals lol, thatd be a tough one"
I just tuned in but I’m guessing Gary Harris got Fred in jail?
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"You can thank Will ""I'm a starter"" Barton and Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris for that."
"Oh yes one image completely proves that Jokic is a bad overall defender. Those drop coverages were part of the team’s plan to contain the paint against the Jazz. Rudy Gobert isn’t a shooting threat so clearly the nuggets coaching staff thought it would be better for Jokic to drop. That isn’t his fault. The return of Gary Harris was testament to where the team’s real defensive problems were. Regardless, we can talk weaknesses and strengths all day. For example, Jokic’s craftiness in the post and playmaking singlehandedly won them the Clippers series which is not something AD would have been able to replicate."
"Over in the Nuggets sub they think he's worth Gary Harris ""and some bench pieces"""
"Damn, you can draw a straight line from him at the top right to Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris down at the bottom left."
They need more wing depth so Campazzo can pass to someone better than Gary Harris
"I hate myself to say this, but they need more campazo and less Gary Harris minutes"
"Gary Harris has been utter shit this year, what is there to debate?"
Gary Harris still plays for us. Grant didn't play good in the regular season. Stop acting like you watched us
No. More like we trade will Barton and Gary Harris for Lebron (please)
Gary Harris stealing a pass from his own morris in order to miss a fast break layup you love to see it
how has gary harris been?
"Idk man, Gary Harris is a pretty terrible shooter these days lol. Agreed though"
Gary Harris barton green frp
"Blazers and nuggets have a similar issue: if you can't stop/slow/mildly bother anyone at the point of attack, it doesn't really matter who is defending the backline.  For y'all it's your starting PG/SG, for us it's anyone not named Gary Harris and occasionally Will Barton. Murray is coming along tho!   Once guards and wings get deep into the paint, it's usually only a matter of time until a bucket"
Gary Harris hopefully
"If Gary Harris did the same things. He would be overwhelmingly voted Garry ""Gary Harris"" Harris."
"Millsap is also an expiring contract and not really an asset. Nuggets first this year will be like 26th, future can be top 10 or even 15 protected so really not a crazy asset. Gary Harris is literally a negative asset."
"Lowry to the nuggets for Gary Harris, Millsap, Bol Bol, 2021 1st, future protected 1st."
"This is a wild take to me.  Lebron has more gravity, and he obviously has a shit ton of experience on Jokic. But jokic’s court vision is second to none. He’s seriously a savant when it comes to being able to look at the floor and knowing what will happen 5 seconds into the future.  Just as an off the top of my head example, checkout this [no look assist from his game last night](https://twitter.com/msinger/status/1346182108524343296?s=21).  He knows the nuggets have (or should have) a guy in the far corner. He knows that faking towards Monte in the near corner and/or a cutting Gary Harris will cause a rotation from Rubio along the baseline, but he’s gotta sell it. So he stares down the area between Morris abs Harris, prompting Rubio to rotate, because he has to. Jokic then, without resetting or anything, flicks it cross court to Facu (a small target) **dead center** to allow him to smoothly catch and shoot. No having to corral a wild pass, reset his feet, then shoot. Just catch and shoot. Perfect pass.  I suspect as he’s doing this, he’s watching for Rubio from his peripheral vision (though probably can’t see facu) and if Ricky doesn’t rotate he just hits the cutting Gary Harris for the free 2 points.  That’s just one example of his court vision taken from a single play from his most recent game. And he’s been doing this same shit pretty routinely for 4-5 years now."
Gary Harris is good at defending Booker
"Jamal missed a game, Porter has missed two and Green (who is one of our only bigs and easily our best defender among the fowards) missed the first 4 games. And we are still two bounces away from 4-2.  But yeah, I do agree with you if simply because Barton looks like a shell of his former self and Gary Harris is basically the new Nick Anderson. And until at least one of those two thing changes, this team won't be scary even with Jamal and Jokic balling out."
I think he's referring to Gary Harris
Enjoy watching Gary Harris drop 2 on 1/6 shooting
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris? What happened to my boy?
"Just stop. Barton and Harris are definitely the main culprits in the bad start (with an assist to Malone and Grant's last minute journey to DET).  BUT Will Barton is coming back from injury and was our 3rd best player last season. He's been trash thriugh 5 games but there is at least a 60/40 chance he regains form. And even if he doesn't, he doesn't deserves the blind hate.  The person you should be pointing fingers at is Gary Harris who fell off a cliff 2 FUCKING YEARS AGO and is basically the new Nick Anderson while making 20m a year."
Name a player on YOUR team that you would consider a comparable trade candidate for Gary Harris.
"To be fair to the Wolves the box score really doesn't tell the full story. The wolves came back from double digit deficits twice in this game and it was close until the 4th quarter where Gary Harris and Will Barton aka the brick bros didn't play. Jokic just pushed the pace in the 4th and the Nuggets got hot from three and I think after the first score by the Wolves the Nuggets went on a 15-0 run. But GG to the wolves, had KAT been there I think the Wolves could have blown the Nuggets out in two quarters."
Wait what? Gary is absolutely a defensive specialist. You thinking of a different Harris?
Meanwhile Gary Harris and Will Barton continue to suck ass
"crucify me, but i believe in my heart of hearts the nuggets would have been better off keeping Beasley than Gary Harris -- defense be dammed"
And Gary Harris
"Possibly, I've seen a lot of guys in Football (Emmanuel Sanders, Terrell Suggs) come back from it and still play close to their pre-injury level.  Also on this note, the injury that lowkey seems to be really devastating is hip injuries. Gerald Henderson, Wilson Chandler, IT all were kinda done after their hip injuries. Gary Harris too has been bad since his hip injury tho idk if he had surgery on it"
We don’t want or need Gary Harris and will Barton.
"Monstars stole Gary Harris offense, will Barton has Timothy luwawu cabarot ability with Jordan mentality."
It’s not that Demar is the problem. Gary Harris is not enough of a problem for DeRozan of all people to be the solution. If that makes sense lol
"I think Pop, after the first practice, would have Gary Harris remove the rim, and then proceed to beat his ass with it"
"Will Barton and Gary Harris who were our 3rd and 4th (ish) guys last year have been playing absolutely terribly. Bricking wide open threes and missing easy layups. Hopefully they'll get their shit together. We also lost two of our important wing defenders in Grant and Craig, and don't really have the personnel to make for it. I think we should trade some offensive guys for some defensive wings and guards, and hope jokic can shore up the offense."
"Nah, Will Barton and Gary Harris just have to play better.   And the bench has to figure it out."
"What happened to him is that he's been getting ""upgraded to doubtful"" for the biggest part of the last 3 seasons lol.  I don't think it has actually hurt his athleticism as much as it has hurt his confidence... Obviously, getting injured so often is gonna take a toll on your body, but I'm really not exaggerating when I say that early on during Jokić era Gary Harris was looking like he's gonna go down as perhaps the GOAT cutter one day. The chemistry between Gary and Yoke really was something else, and the fact that Gary was a really solid shooter back then made it even better.  And then the injuries started to pile up, but Gary was still more or less the same guy, even improving defensively and looking like he's more comfortable with putting the ball on the floor... but as the time went on not only did his shooting splits begin to tank, his cutting ability has really diminished. From a guy that was such an electric cutter he went to looking pretty damn lethargic. Obviously, some of it has to do with there being more mouths to feed these days and thus Gary's role (which was complimentary as an offball 3+D piece to begin with) getting diminished, but he's definitely gotten slower, less confident (both in his athleticism and shot) and with those skills taking a hit, he doesn't really have anything particularly useful to bring to the floor aside from being a really solid defender (and there's an asterisk to that as well, which I'll get to in a second).  He isn't really a playmaker nor is he particularly good at putting the ball down on the floor so staggering him with the 2nd unit to get in the groove doesn't really help, and he's kinda undersized to begin with so even though he's a really solid positional defender, you can't really throw him at wings like you can get away with swingmen guards, which further limits his game.  Basically he either needs to get his shot back, or to regain his athletic ability if we are too see the good old Gary back... and it's a shame, because he really seemed like he's a go to iso move around the perimeter away from breaking into star tier of players early on."
&gt;Gary Harris is an abysmal offensive player. More of his minutes need to keep going to PJ Dozier.  This makes no sense
"They lost a lot of their defense in grant, plumlee, and craig. Gary harris still cant find his shot. The rotations and construction is a little wack too. Its a shame since they were my favorite team last year"
Guys like Gary Harris and Will Barton have been dogshit
"He’s not great but he’s good and the rest of the team, except maybe gary harris, is average or worse.  He also couldnt find his three point shot in the playoffs which he had been hitting at 39% the two seasons."
"while we are on it, what the hell is happening to Gary Harris?  he was so so good few years ago has since been regressing massively every year"
"Gary Harris is really bad and plays too many minutes. More of his minutes need to go to PJ Dozier.   Will Barton handles the ball too much, he's a good player but plays for himself and doesn't know how to get others involved.   Perimeter defense is bad. We give up a ton of open 3s. I don't have the exact stats to back this up, but I guarantee we give up the most corner 3s."
"Both teams are in the same boat at the moment.  Denver look terrible offensively without Jokic on the court. For Denver, Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ have had periods where they have been excellent.  For Denver, Gary Harris has been ok defensively but awful offensively. For Denver, Will Barton, Milsap, P.J. Dojier have oscillated from Okay to unplayable. Green has looked good in short spurts for Denver and probably deserves more minutes.  The Raptors barely look like an NBA team without Lowry. For the Raptors, Boucher &amp; Van Vleet have had periods where they have been excellent. For the Raptors, OG has been good defensively but his offense has been iffy. For the raptors, Siakam, Powell, T.D have all oscillated between okay to unplayable. For the raptors, Matt Thomas has looked good and should get more minutes, especially when the raptors has periods where they can't hit a 3 to save their lives.  But overall as things settle down, I thing the Nuggets will be fine because Jokic's facilitation has been sublime. If Gary Harris and Will Barton stop missing open shots/layups they will be fine.  Really worried about the raptors, especially, if Siakam can't get back to an all-star level"
Can I interest you in Gary Harris or Will Barton?
Sebastian Telfair  Frank Ntilikina  Julius Randle  Harrison Barnes  Nicolas Batum  Willie Cauley-Stein  Jake Layman  Darius Miles  Gary Harris  Gordon Hayward  Kelly Oubre  Jordan Clarkson
Is Gary Harris slowly turning into Kris Dunn or something?
Gary ‘Mario Chalmers’ Harris
That’s a lot of talent on one team. Idk nuggets won’t trade anyone. Should’ve traded Gary Harris 3 years ago same with Barton
Nuggets starters look OK at least. It’s their bench failing them. Well and Gary Harris
"Denver’s stars look amazing still, Gary Harris is lost though  Meanwhile Boucher has outplayed Siakam"
Wonder who says no to a MPJ-Gary Harris-Barton for Siakam-Powell-Flynn trade?
I personally like Gary “Garry Harris” Harris.
"make it simple, Gary "" Gary Harris"" Harris"
"make it simple, Gary "" Gary Harris"" Harry"
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris
The Nuggets desperately need defense and swapping Gary Harris and Paul Millsap for PG and RoCo in the starting line would be very nice.
"I don’t think so. He would be a great pf next to jokic. He’s already a better defender than mpj ever will be. And lord knows we need it. Jokic and Murray are both poor defenders, Simmons is an all around talent. I’m fine with keeping mpj and I love him but like our team looks like ass on defense. Realistically I would like to see a Barton or Harris trade. But I know our front office hasn’t done it for the last 2 years that there have been rumors and Gary Harris is worth a bag of rocks now, with his contract. I’d also like the nuggets to figure out the backup center position, jokic has to play 38 minutes for us to be competitive, it’s kinda sad"
Gary Harris. He's barely an NBA level player rn other than stellar defence
Gary Harris &amp; will Barton
I believe he is the key defensive piece that the Nuggets need. Gary Harris can't guard big wings effectively and there isn't a single other defensively sound player on the roster.
In the playoffs I’m more worried about Gary Harris now and for the rest of my life
Gary Harris for MVP
What is the point of Gary Harris? He's not actually a shut down defender and has as much offensive game as me.
"Hmm, a nice well thought out and reasonable response. Thank you for that. I want to say that with his versatile defense, and the fact that he shot 39% from 3 still made him a solid role player in the regular season, but of course you would know more. I also want to say I predicted a lot of your flaws (Gary Harris regressing further, campazzo being bad, poor depth and defense) which is why my initial comment meant to say it wasn't just because of Grant leaving, but from the outside looking in, I feel like Malone is a good coach and most of the issues aren't on him. But again, you would know more  That said, as a blazers fan, I'd be lying if I said you're underperformance thus far didn't make me happy"
Gary Harris and Zach are on essentially identical contracts
"They would have to send all the Picks and send Pascal to 3rd team for more picks. And still might not be enough    Possible 3 team trade:  DEN RECEIVES: Pascal, House  HOU RECEIVES: MPJ, Gary Harris, Bol Bol, 1st rd  picks(s) from DEN, ALL OF Raps picks they can trade  TOR RECEIVES: James Harden"
Gary Harris is ruining the present
Nobody is trading for Gary Harris
"Gary Harris is the new Nick Anderson, Will Barton looks like he's still hurt, and CP3 is still the clutchest player in the league"
"Not concerned about the Nuggets but Gary Harris &amp; Monte Morris have to improve. They are going to need those two, alongside Barton, to step up when MPJ is absent."
Gary harris looked sharp for the suns
"Man, what is wrong with the nuggets. Was jerami grant that important? Or is it something to do with will barton and gary harris being absolute trash"
the anti-Gary Harris.
How many actually positive defenders do the nuggets even have? Gary Harris (maybe Millsap?) seems like the only one to me and it's tough to play him when the guy guarding him gets a personal timeout on every play
"Why are people doing the Gary ""GARY HARRIS"" Harris meme to this man"
Someone post the Gary Harris face after the obvious foul that got KD a tech
"Is this the new Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris?"
"Gary 'Gary Harris' Harris still has the best nickname though, can't take that away from him."
"I’m in tears. I miss my Goldfish.   Gary “Gary Harris” Harris was going to be a future young star in the making until those hip injuries. He was a solid shooter, was a great driver, and insane defender.   He’s still a good driver (when confident) amd defender but he’s nowhere close to what he was. I’m glad someone else took notice of him."
