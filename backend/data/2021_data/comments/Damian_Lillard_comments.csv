"2007-2011 Melo was seriously amazing, I'd argue he compares favorably to the likes of Tatum, Brown, Middleton, Paul George and Butler in his prime.   this is a 6x All-NBA selection who averaged 25+ on playoff teams for 8 years straight. He also would have thrived in a more open playstyle IMO. Plus, his defense was definitely better overall than a Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Beal, etc. I think you're really sleeping on what he did in Denver, he went punch for punch with Kobe in the 2010 WCF and averaged 30 in the playoffs."

"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"

"Wait a second, I know This! The blazers have some sort of adversity during the regular season, everyone counts them out, Damian Lillard plays his heart out and they barely manage to make the playoffs. Feels like I’ve seen this before"
"For real. Like I was watching the Bulls/Knicks game tonight and two players *clearly* were fighting for possession of the ball. A jump ball would be the obvious and correct call that anyone with a passing knowledge of basketball could make. They called a **foul** on the Bulls instead. There was literary no contact. Just two guys with their hands on the ball trying to yank it from each other.  Keep in mind the refs called an obvious intentional foul on Zach Lavine a jump ball the other night. That jump ball led to a Damian Lillard game winner. How the fuck do you fail to blow the whistle are two, **TWO** players internationally fouling another player?  Like, this shit is impossible to excuse. I can’t believe they are actually this bad at their jobs, so I tend to think they’re corrupt, malicious, or both."
"We're in a league where Anthony Davis is a second guy. You think Damian Lillard can be the #1 guy on a contending team??? Yikes, dog..."
"I'd say [he's been rewarded](https://www.nba.com/news/report-damian-lillard-blazers-near-supermax-deal).   (But yes, I also want him to win a chip.)"
"Ok first off, the portland trailblazers and Damian Lillard have a much better roster than the warriors right now. That's not a debate, the warriors have no depth.. Outside of their average starting five, they have one of the worst teams in the NBA.   So if we look at the team success so far, Steph Curry's warriors, who are a worse team than Lillard's blazers, are essentially tied in record (10-9,11-9). Don't underestimate that blazers team though. CJ McCollum is an all-star level player, he just hasn't had the appearances because the team he's on isn't usually high enough in the standings to warrant a #2 guy like McCollum to make it. Why are the blazers not usually higher in the standings then? It's not the coaching, Terry Stotts has built a great system. It's not the surrounding cast, the blazers have guys like Nurkic, Kanter, Trent Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Rodney Hood, and others in the past, etc... It's because Lillard is not good enough to push them to the next level. It's not always as easy as just putting up the numbers. It's the same reason why Harden, who puts up crazy numbers, hasn't had much team success. Both are not as efficient and don't affect the game in different enough ways to make up for that, unlike a guy like Lebron who does everything, or KD &amp; Curry who are extremely efficient."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Just a really big red flag is Jrue is the anti-Damian Lillard, but you’ll have to hope Trent, Simmons, and Covington shoot well enough"

Westbrook and Beal invoked the spirit of Damian Lillard
The ghost of Damian Lillard strikes
"This guy's team has Damian Lillard on it, trust him, he knows his flops."
"That’s tough when his teammate was averaging 28/4/7 and simultaneously holding Damian Lillard to 18 ppg, just so AD could win *one* playoffs series."
"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
It's kind of funny that if Curry shot 38% from 3 on like 11 attempts people would say that he could have done better because he's yet to shoot below 40% for a season despite that being basically Damian Lillard numbers.

It is more like Damian Lillard vs AD. Lillard had more early success and is in a ball dominate position and puts better stats but AD has more physical potential and is a better two way player.

"This:     When Curry entered the NBA in 2009, the average NBA team attempted 18 threes a game. It hovered around that mark for the first three years of Curry's career until his breakout season of 2012-13 which just so happened to coincide with the NBA itself becoming more 3-point happy. The same year that Golden State's golden child set the all-time record for made 3s (a record he would go on to break multiple times in the coming years), NBA teams for the first time averaged 20 3-point attempts per game.  As Curry's shooting continued to explode and the [Warriors](https://ca.nba.com/contestant/golden-state-warriors/news/btbrq55c3e6btsf1z2poaakb4) transformed into a juggernaut, the rest of the league ramped up its efforts to keep pace with the free-wheeling Warriors. By the 2018-19 season, the fifth straight year that Curry's Warriors reached the NBA Finals, teams were shooting over 32 of them per game.  In that 2012-13 breakout campaign, Curry hoisted 7.7 per game and was the only player in the entire league to average at least seven. Care to guess how many players topped that threshold this season?  28.  There were 28 instances of something this season alone that had only happened a grand total of 28 times in NBA history prior to Curry's arrival.  Kids all over the world have spent the better part of the last decade emulating Curry in driveways, parks and gyms, a trend helped by the fact that Curry is about as physically relatable as any superstar in the history of the game. You can't just go in the driveway and uncork drop-step dunks. Or look in the mirror and pretend to be chiseled like LeBron. Even the famous tagline 'Be Like Mike' ignores the fact that it's utterly impossible to replicate the 6'6"" Air Jordan.  But anyone can heave as many off-balance 3s as humanly possible. Look no further than the NBA itself as James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker, Trae Young and many others have followed in Curry's footsteps and leaned into the novel concept of 3 &gt; 2.  The 3-point revolution represents the biggest on-court strategic change in the history of the sport and there's no player more single-handed responsible for it than the original Splash Brother.

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"And media pundits who want him in big markets.  Talk to any espn outlet and they'll tell you Devin Booker wants out of Phoenix, yesterday.  Talk to Devin Booker and he'll tell you he wants to spend his career in Phoenix. Shit, you can't even use the ""Sarver bad"" argument to say he'll get pushed out because Booker is like one of the few Suns (much like Nash) who has a fantastic relationship with the owner. You can point to LMA, John Wall, but that's not a fair comparison when Booker is much closer to Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal than he is to either of the aforementioned.  Same crap with Beal, Lavine, and I promise if the Mavs don't put together a .650 team around Luka, he'll be the next subject of criticism. Hell, people still expect Dame to want to leave when he's dropping 50+ in losses as if his entire team isn't out for injury."
"yeah but i basically want him to be damian lillard with his 3. mitchell's catch and shoot is elite (he's like top three in the league or something stupid) but off the dribble it isn't nearly as automatic  but that would be like true superstar, if he had lillard's shot. i'd also be cool if he became a better defender without it taking a toll on his offence"

2 mvps vs 14 All-NBA selections   Is derrick rose greater than damian lillard because rose has more MVPS but dame has a couple more All-NBA selections
Damian Lillard of course  /s
"Booker has routinely been pegged as an “overrated empty stats guy”   It’s not that, people have this crazy defense force for Damian Lillard"
&gt;Giannis gets more excuses made for him more than any other player in the league right now.   It’s Damian Lillard and it’s not close. Dude is immortal on here lol.
"Damian ""George Foreman"" Lillard"

Hassan Whiteside has more career triple doubles than Damian Lillard.
"Damian ""George Foreman"" Lillard."
I would argue Kyrie is better than Damian Lillard but I know this isn't the right subreddit for that lol
"Thanks but no thanks. We will live and if it must be, die with Lillard to the end! He’s not going anywhere. His roots are deeply entwined here in Portland. For example, just this summer he open Damian Lillard Toyota, his family all lives here and his future legacy is important to him. Niel Olshey wouldn’t trade him, period. But you can keep dreaming."
"Donovan Mitchell made his 600th career 3-pointer last night.  He reached that mark in 240 games, the fastest player in NBA history to do so:  240 - Mitchell  244 - Buddy Hield  247 - Damian Lillard  248 - Klay Thompson  249 - Stephen Curry"
"well yeah if they already had, damian lillard for example."
You should check out Old Man and the Three with JJ Reddick and Damian Lillard. They mention how everyone knows the majority of players run and that the lingo for calling plays is for the most part the same. So when KCP mentions this play it’s probably known by everyone. Overall though it’s kinda funny how he just said it
it's somehow worse than the troll who said Damian Lillard had fallen out of the top 20 players in the NBA earlier today
"Why are you being so condescending hahaha  Let’s look at James Hard and Stephen Curry. Both are the system and are superstars. Kawhi Leonard— superstar and trancends a system that revolves around him.   Damian Lillard— superstar? I think so. Plays within a system that allows him to go off. I can see why people would argue against it.   Donovan Mitchell is a star and not a superstar. Rudy Gobert being the focus of their system has produced him individual awards and no real post season success. Good defensive player, not a superstar."
Damian Lillard at the same age as Murray (23) and Mitchell (24) looked pretty similar. Just saying.
"Those are pretty tough ones, but I’ll try: Kostas Antetokounmpo, Nick Claxton, Kent Bazemore, Ivica Zubac, Bryn Forbes, Maxi Kleber, Matisse Thybulle, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Caleb Martin, aaaaaaand Damian Lillard?"
Damian Lillard and Brandon Ingram

 Damian Lillard 2018-19  25.8/4.6/6.9 58.8 TS%   Most overrated MVP award of all time
"Trae had 19 free throws this game.   When he hit a slump, it was a surprisingly popular take that Steve Nash had made his ""that's not basketball"" comments, and soon after the refs stopped giving Trae foul calls.  That seems much more like people expressing their own displeasure with Trae's game and idea of how the game should be played than reality.   Those fouls given when defenders run around screens and Trae stops short are still fouls and are going to get called. They're fouls when damian lillard does it, they're fouls when Steph does it, and they're fouls when Trae does it.   If defenders want to stop it, they can switch, go under the screen, or else they have to be able to stop on a dime after fighting over a screen, but they're not going to stop calling a foul that's given across the league because one player is doing it more frequently."
Look at the vote breakdown during those years.    KD finished around 7-9 each year.    Players like John Wall Paul George Joel Embiid Jokic and Damian Lillard all finished above him. And he finished slightly above Demar DeRozan.

"&gt; What Beal quote has sounded like a guy who cares more about his numbers than winning?  IIRC he had a quote on JJ Redick's podcast about how important it was to him to have a team centered around him.  &gt; Like, we're shitting on a guy that has stayed loyal to his team through ups and downs now, wow.   Except with the Wizards it's been ""down"" for 4 years now and there's no hope of being ""up"" anytime in the near future. Like I said, it's not a Damian Lillard situation.  &gt; And if he demanded a trade out of DC, you would be shitting on him either way.   No, I wouldn't."
"Damian Lillard is at the peak of his powers.  We saw it last year and he's gonna do it again this season.  Sadly, we might have to see him score more than ever with CJ &amp; Nurkic out.

"This is crap. There are so many great players through history that did four years of college, like Tim Duncan, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Steve Nash  You either got it or you dont"
RAPTOR is weird. Damian Lillard being #4 offensively makes sense. But 3rd worst in the NBA defensively? dunno about that one.
"It says right there that Damian Lillard played better, hope that helps"
"Classic. Asks have you even played basketball. CLASSIC.   First off no one on this sub is PG13. The all-nba 1st team defender who's 6""7 and supposed to be one of the best defenders in the game. Therefore my experience playing D1 ball has no impact on if this was good or bad defense.   Please come @ me with an actual fact instead of an opinion.   I'll repeat the facts.    PG13 is a great defender. All-NBA 1st team level.   Damian Lillard hit a shot from that spot to start the 3rd quarter.   PG13 didn't close the space and looked like he was terrified of getting blown by.   Instead of trusting the his help and using his All-NBA 1st team level defensive abilities. He backed off and gave Lillard a clean look.     If PG13 himself says he was wrong and it's a good shot. Why does reddit still think it's a bad shot?   Has reddit ever played basketball at PG13's level?"
Damian Lillard is a good man.
"and how many of those shots were for game winners? A shooting percentage from a certain distance doesn't mean as a gameplan you go ""Overplay Damian Lillard so he shoots from 25 feet instead of 30"". That's not a real rebuttal, you're just dismissing the criticism of that being an absurd shot to take."
https://www.si.com/nba/cavaliers/nba/cavaliers/nba-amico/damian-lillard-long-range-jumpers  There's a link by someone that doesn't have interest in the Blazers.
Damian Lillard. He actually has to create his shots.
Damian Lillard is an american professional basketball player.
"no player except griffin over 6'7 has failed to try at least one dunk this season let that sink in  shooting 37%, free throw rate down to 3.1 per game, 0.1 bpg, damian lillard is averaging more, and he's listed generously at 6'2 trea young averages more too, listed at 6'1 Chris Paul, aged 35 and listed at 6'1, is averaging more. all 6'3 and 120 pounds of stephen curry is outrebounding blake   advanced stats indicate that he's below replacement level this year. safely below meaning that a random G league guy would be better than griffin atm"
I believe it is Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr time
Damian Lillard just ruined everything for Chris Paul
Jaylen “Steph ‘Damian Lillard’ Curry” Brown
DAMIAN LILLARD FROM HALF
Pretty solid second option in Damian Lillard
I still wanna know how is Damian Lillard not a starter
Damian Lillard will win all star MVP
"""Everyone hyping up Curry during this 3 point contest, but this season he's shooting a lower percentage on contested 3s from 40 ft. than Damian Lillard""    - Nate Duncan (probably)"
"I mean no, Allen Iverson, Damian Lillard doesn’t belong in the same sentence, and none of those players belong anywhere near the top 20 all time where you Steph stans like to think he has a claim. So you are kind of shooting your self in the foot bringing them up."
"I forgot you have to be a stud on defense to be considered elite at all  Allen Iverson, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard? All not elite"
"He is not the worst defender this season DBPM Damian lillard -1.5 Trae: -1.5 Sexton, Ja and fox all have worse defensive rating them him.  Advance stats can’t prove everything but saying he is the worst defender is totally base on reputation and show how uneducated u are. He is not an average player, that for sure"
He has extremely similar stats this year (4th season) to 4th season Damian Lillard.  But watching Dame back then felt much different than watching Mitchell.
Ok Damian Lillard fan
"One simple reason for our record being as good as it is, we have a Damian Lillard"
It's hard to do that without a superstar player getting injured though. It's not like Portland could just sit Damian Lillard for a year
"43 vs 38% is not ""essentially the same efficiency"" that's literally the difference between Damian Lillard and Marcus Smart's efficiency"
"What's so strong about the West? Lakers are injured. Clippers are chokers. Jazz are young and inexperienced, no way they even make the conference finals. Warriors are just Steph. Luka and Mavs aren't playing well and are also young. Damian Lillard is just fools gold. Kinda a weak conference."

Damian *fucking* Lillard.  And then he takes the charge to seal the game with 3.3 left. I love this man.

"Here are a few short sections for those who don't have The Athletic (it's a much longer article)  &gt;His emotions had been worn thin because, in the past 18 months, it seemed like he had lived a lifetime. In 2020, he was the first to discover the dead body of his cousin and personal chef. An aunt died from cancer. A family friend died of COVID-19. And in the early months of 2021, a cousin was killed in West Oakland.  &gt;And then last Thursday, the day before the Lakers game, Lillard learned of the shooting deaths of two people in his inner circle. One was a cousin close enough to Lillard to be at his family’s Thanksgiving dinner in Portland in November. The other was like family — the best friend of perhaps his closest cousin, who was among the first family members to move to Portland when Lillard was drafted by the Trail Blazers in 2012.  ----------  &gt;In May of 2020, he checked in on the Portland-area home of his cousin and personal chef, Brandon Johnson, and found him dead on the kitchen floor. Brandon, or Chef B as he was called, was 35.  &gt;“I stood over his body, man. Like, he was dead. Minutes. I’m standing over his body,” Lillard said. “People don’t know what type of trauma that is, and what that is to have somebody that close to you laid out and you stand over him. Like, I still struggle with that. You know what I mean? Like, I still struggle with that. That’s a battle for me.”  &gt;That morning, Lillard called teammate CJ McCollum, who was also close to Johnson, and when McCollum arrived, the two cried together in the kitchen.  &gt;“I was hurt by that,” Lillard said. “I cried a lot. Just hurt … I was with B every day, and in the summers when I would travel to train, he would come and make sure I was eating right. I was with him every day. Talked with him every day. Sat there with him every day. So that one just had me hurt. To this day.”  ---------------  &gt;“I told Nate it’s been weird, my son (Damian Jr.) has been like ‘Dad … Dad … Dad … every 30 seconds,”’ Lillard said. “Dad, let’s go downstairs. Dad, let’s watch TV. Dad, play dinosaur. Over and over. And I told Nate that it just brought me happiness, that he was calling me ‘Dad’ over and over. He doesn’t know what doing on with me, but he knows I’m his dad.”  &gt;If Lillard leaves the room, Junior stops what he is doing and follows.  &gt;“And when I’m holding the twins and feeding them, just knowing they belong to me, and that one day they are going to feel as strongly about me as Junior?” Lillard said. “It helps things a lot when you come home to that.”"
"Just so we're clear, averaging 28/6/7 on 58% TS in the playoffs as a Rocket counts as ""not showing up when it matters,"" correct?  I'd hate to see what you think of Damian Lillard or Donovan Mitchell or Jimmy Butler, then. Because they're all worse in the playoffs than Harden."
Steph is a better 3 point shooter  Dame is [better from deep](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-has-better-range-steph-curry-and-numbers-prove-it)  Fucking casuals man I swear.
"I'm doing active players only, here we go:  G: Damian Lillard (6'2"")  G: Steph Curry (6'3"")  F: Dort (6'3"")  F: Zion Williamson (6'7"")  C: Bam Adebayo (6'9"")   That is exactly 32 feet worth of player"
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
"I agree with a lot of what you wrote.  the good PR aspect, the way my viewpoint is through the lens of a team with a successful past, points against the ""rings"" threshold.  I do still disagree with a couple parts though.  &gt;If Harden doesn't deserve his number retired simply cuz he didn't get a ring with the Rockets..  I did not say this in the slightest.  I said rings carry weight, but are not the end all be all for reasons you have stated.  When I think of a wining player I do not think of Harden.  It is not due to the fact he has no rings, but the way those rocket teams disappointed in the playoffs with him at the helm.  The narrative after every key loss was Harden mailing it in seeming to quit, these could be unfair but it is what comes to mind with Harden.  To give an example of a player who has not won but deserves to have their jersey retirement is actually from a comment above, Damian Lillard.  He has 0 rings, but has taken worse teams further in the playoffs and hit big shots along the way.  More importantly, he embodies the entire Trailblazer's organization.  You think Portland, you think Dame.  Retirements imo should be about what a player brought to the franchise all around.  Harden to me feels more like a guy with incredible solo achievements and numbers who happened to be a Houston Rocket while doing so.  EDIT: Either way appreciate actual dialogue and debate instead of down votes and hate for an opinion that doesn't align with yours!"

"Thinking about it just now, Gilbert is probably a sort of pioneer for the modern perimeter player (which is strange to say because I also consider him modern). He would have loved and feasted in today's game, considering how much he already feasted back then.   I saw someone mention Damian Lillard and I think that's pretty good. He was just one of those first dudes to really decide he was going to bomb from deep off the dribble without conscious, and do it well enough to make you believe it's a serviceable strategy."
"If you forget the DPoY thing, hat's a description of Damian Lillard to me."
No because he was pretty much a less efficient Damian Lillard but played better defense.

The Jazz would be a championship team with Damian Lillard instead of Mitchell

"Damian Lillard &amp; Jaylen Brown.  They'd be a very complimentary back-court pairing, also they're my 2 favorite players in the NBA"
"&gt; If Damian Lillard or James Harden was averaging 25ppg/8apg on 59% TS on the 3rd seed he would be getting 0 MVP consideration.  Hmm.  **Dame averaged 27ppg/7apg on 59% TS on the 3rd seed in 2018 and got MVP consideration.**  **PG averaged 28ppg/4apg on 58% TS on the *6th seed* and got MVP consideration in 2019.**  Meanwhile, Lebron is not the MVP favorite.  It seems like this entire comment was pulled straight out of your ass. All of this data is publicly available and yet you still go with the narrative you prefer."
"Nope, not true, they would get consideration if they were averaging MVP numbers, why wouldn’t they?  Quite the opposite to what you are saying, if LeBron and Lillard were both averaging 30 points and had the exact same record, voters would be more obliged to give the MVP to Damian Lillard just because he would be a first time winner"
"I'll put it this way.     If Damian Lillard or James Harden was averaging 25ppg/8apg on 59% TS on the 3rd seed he would be getting 0 MVP consideration. If you said they should be MVP you'd get laughed at. But for Lebron, those same numbers will make him MVP favorite."
"If it's not Embiid or Jokic it doesn't matter, can't see anyone else win unless things radically change after the all star break   Only other player would be Curry but unless his team jumps to top 3-4 I don't see any remote chance of him having a case  Shout out to Damian Lillard"

CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better.

Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Clyde Drexler is an objectionally better player than Damian Lillard and Blazers fans are insane.
Wow. This just shows how little the average NBA fan knows about the Suns. This is like telling Portland fans Damian Lillard isn't their best player
So you want to watch officials bait players into getting techs? Really? So if a ref mocks Damian Lillard and then when Lillard gets rightfully upset he should get a tech? That is actually what you think?

"If it’s not Lillard now then it’s going to be soon. He already has one more All-NBA appearance then Clyde and is about to get another this season. Clyde does have 2 more All-Star appearances though.  Their playoff history is also fairly close with an edge to Clyde. Clyde loses to Jordan, Damian Lillard gets eliminated by the prime Warriors."

Hell even Booker this year has 24.7 ppg on 60.7% TS and he isn't having a year as close to as good as some of those Curry years.

"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"

"Portland has paid luxury tax many times before this year. if we had more cap space, yet could still pay Damian Lillard his supermax, we'd be a better team."
"idk about that - the Suns have a 66.7 win% this season, that's higher than any Damian Lillard-led Portland team or any Luka-led Dallas team (plus dallas has more issues than just injuries).  I'll give you Golden State but even then, 20-10 puts the Suns in top 4 contention."
Those games were such fucking bullshit. Dame robbed us of our deserved playoff spot by flopping his way to the free throw line to beat the teams that should have beat him. Fuck Damian Lillard. Good thing we owned his ass last night and we will again in the playoffs.
Damian Lillard is an elite player who hasn’t had another superstar come join his team. Team success should not count against him when he’s one of the few players who hasn’t jumped shipped or begged for a big 3
"league gonna have to send him [another one of those sternly worded letters about flopping](https://www.blazersedge.com/2019/4/8/18301092/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-warned-flopping-nba-officials#:~:text=Portland%20Trail%20Blazer%20Damian%20Lillard,game%20against%20the%20Denver%20Nuggets.&amp;text=Flopping%20is%20defined%20as%20%E2%80%9Cany,a%20foul%20on%20another%20player.%E2%80%9D)"
&gt;  But one name not included is Damian Lillard  I haven't seen one MVP discussion on ESPN or other sources in the last week or two that didn't mention Lillard.
"I love the Jazz so much more than them, but I was born in Portland AND Damian Lillard played at Weber State, which was about 20 minutes away from where I grew up. I love seeing the Blazers do well. Thankfully the Jazz and Blazers have also never played in a series together in my time being a fan, so I haven't had to experience that."
"The redundancy (at the expense of flexibility) is the perceived problem, I think, kind of like Milwaukee in the West.  How do you counter a team playing five-out over a seven-game series? LAL, LAC, DEN, and DAL can all throw pretty good five-out looks out there and I think what people have taken away from your Houston and Denver losses over the past couple years is that Gobert / Snyder don't have a great answer to teams playing five-out. Hell, I wouldn't even feel great about Portland with Damian Lillard watching a bunch of Bubble Murray film.  I'm aware that the defense against Houston was actually pretty good at times in some of those 5-game series, I also think our effort in the first half of the Bubble series was pretty atrocious and we really should have won that one in 5 or 6.  So IDK. I don't have a ton of faith in the Jazz to make it through the West but I also think you could beat anybody. I kind of like your chances against the Lakers in particular."
PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Brandon Roy  SF: Clyde Drexler  PF: LaMarcus Aldridge  C: Bill Walton
"No, I said Harden can't win because his team is too stacked offensively. Part of that includes having Kevin Durant, the better player and more valuable player to the team on his team. You know this, don't be naive. So arguing Harden can win MVP as the less valuable player by comparing it to Lebron winning with Bosh is literally trying to say ""Lebron was worse than Bosh and he STILL won MVP on his stacked team!"" Thats a faulty example.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; If Harden doesn't clearly show he's the best of the Nets trio obviously he's not gonna get MVP consideration. But if he emerges as the alpha dog (remains yet to be seen if he will but his last week or so has hinted that it could be the case), the fact that he has a top 5 player teammate (KD/Wade) and a top 10-20 player teammate (Kyrie/Bosh) won't necessarily eliminate him from MVP consideration just like it didn't for LeBron in Miami.   I don't really have much to say to this. This is like saying Damian Lillard or Luka can win MVP or something. Like, yes its theoretically possible. Anything is possible. But this is about the chances of it happening. ""Likelihood of being MVP"" That's what I said. And besides, this is Durants team. Kyrie knows it, Harden knows it, Nash knows it, we all know it. Durant is here BECAUSE its his team, he's the alpha this time.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; I'm not convinced Harden is a better player than Durant but that's not the argument you were making originally. If you said, ""you can't win an MVP when you're not even the best player on your own team,"" sure, I'd wholeheartedly agree.   I am convinced Durant is better than Harden and most are. And yes, that was my argument. If you didn't get ""Durant is on Hardens team"" when I said ""Hardens team is too insanely offensively stacked"" I'm sorry, but I feel like thats obvious enough."

"The refs almost never change the call from what it was on the floor unless it’s clear and obvious (which this wasn’t). You have a guy in Damian Lillard who is known for hitting game winners, and not getting the opportunity to advance the ball and run a play for him is terrible.  Also I don’t think that’s the case, they would have been able to reset the clock to when the foul occurred regardless."
"But they only had 1 timeout, basically putting your only chance at winning in the hands of the referees that called that soft foul in the first place, they're never going to overturn that. Alternatively, they live with the call, don't challenge, and draw up a play for Damian Lillard who is... kinda known for knocking down shots with 2.4 seconds left on the clock."

It feels like he elevates his team but for whatever reason he hasn't had the on/off of people like Damian Lillard, Jokic, Giannis, Curry, CP3, Lebron etc do year in and year out. I'm going to chalk it up to statistical noise but 3 years is a decent sample size and so is two years if you throw out his rookie season."

"Let’s not pretend the Damian Lillard rumors don’t exist, too..."
6th man: Damian Lillard
There's a level of subjectivity to most sports debates (especially greatest player ever debates) but some things are pretty obvious and more straightforward. No one should entertain a conversation about Damian Lillard being better than Kawhi Leonard or Steph Curry.
Anyone who says that hasn’t seen AD before last season. He embarrassed Damian lillard who is one of the best post season performers ever. Dame had to basically reinvent his approach to the pick and roll with how AD and Jrue blitzed him
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
"Then write a letter to the Bus family to buy Drew Hanlen, he coaches RJ, Lavine, Tatum, Clarkson, Embiid, Beal, Zion and Hayward and has coached Randle a lil bit or Johnnie Bryant, the Knicks shooting coach who was Damian Lillard´s and Donovan Mitchell´s trainer since they were in college. Gonna cost a lot though, I´m sure Hanlen makes at least 3 mill per year rn if not more with all the stars he´s working with and Bryant is getting coaching offers from colleges left and right with how our team´s shooting has improved in just one year (for example University of Utah was just after him like a month or two ago) but tbh the Lakers could use those 2 a lot.  I think the developmental side of your coaching staff needs a step up. None of your players have really taken a jump since coming to LA for a while now. Kuzma has kinda found his old self this year but that´s about it and that jump could easily be just due to injuries/more minutes/getting better cuz he´s getting close to his prime now."
Damian Lillard did the same thing in the same year against the same team.
It was separated ribs.  https://www.nba.com/news/report-damian-lillard-separated-ribs
"Unless that guard is named Damian Lillard, but that's mostly a Terry stotts problem"
Nobody cares about going to the Finals 8 straight times? Lol this is a big brained take.   Damian Lillard literally averaged 32/4/8 on 54% TS against the Warriors as the first option the same year: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-western-conference-semifinals-trail-blazers-vs-warriors.html   Maybe PG wouldn’t have scored as much but he would’ve made it up on the defensive end.
"What are you talking about? LeBron was going to go to the Finals whether Kyrie was there or not. He literally won two games without Kyrie or Love the previous year. He nearly won a game after they added KD in 2018.   He didn’t need Kyrie specifically, he needed another scorer. Damian Lillard could’ve done the same thing, or Paul George, or Chris Paul ... you get the idea. Kyrie played well but he didn’t do anything that was irreplaceable."
"Kyrie played well, just not as close to as well as LeBron. There are plenty of other players that could’ve done what Kyrie did, an easy example being Damian Lillard. No other player could’ve done what LeBron did."
"Who has the clutch gene? Damian Lillard will never sniff the NBA finals let alone give up a 3-1 lead, does all of his Dame time shit mean absolutely jack? Where tf was his Dame time in 2018 when he got his scrub ass swept? How about 2019 where he lost 4 double digit leads to a team with no clutch gene?  Durant couldn't even get to the finals over the team that choked the 3-1 finals lead. Does that make him a superchoker?"
"Luka may complain to the refs and have stuff to say that they might not wanna hear, but Damian Lillard is damn near the biggest whiner in the nba. This guy disputes every single call that goes against him and may only have less technicals than Luka because of his reputation. This could be downvoted but Blazers fans and anyone else who watches blazers games know this is true."
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."

"&gt; Most of the premier volume shooters/scorers in history used isolation plays to reach those numbers.  Outside of Harden, no they didn't.   https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/  As you can see even Harden is an outlier at 33.7% isolation frequency and the more important number is FGA in these situations, 6.4 FGA per 8.3 possessions of isolation. Players like Giannis, LeBron, Luka, Kyrie, and Kawhi are all below 19% isolation (KD is at 14.7%) and their FGA in these situations is less than 4 a game, usually 2-3 for superstars.   The stat only goes back to 2015 but I am almost positive even some like Kobe was below Carmelo and Harden. In other words, isolation isn't a common offensive scheme at all. It was more common in the 90s because illegal defense rules favored 1 vs 1 situations, now that's far more difficult with help defense being so dynamic.   Summary: literally no team outside of Houston with Harden (and well Melo with NYK) design around isolation. LeBron and KD gets most of their points in PnR, transition, off of screens, cuts, etc. This Warriors team is built around Steph Curry because he has that ridiculous ceiling if you design some screening sets for him, the same way any other team tries to maximize their superstars' ceilings. It's foolish to believe Damian Lillard could do the same thing running the same sets because his release simply isn't as quick nor does he have the stamina to run 6 miles every game. That's why he sticks with PnR, a set which Curry historically did well in but has spammed more this season due to personnel being so limited and that has also boosted his numbers. Teams are doing everything they can to prevent Steph from getting any space yet he's still putting up 20+ shots a game."
Paul George and Damian Lillard have got kind of a spicy history. Could be fun.
"Why are you including Jokic, Lebron, AD, PG and Kawhi? None of those players are recent additions. If that's the case, then let's just consider Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum as improvements for the Blazers too.  The point of this is that Dame and CJ made the WCF without Nurk/RoCo/Norman. Unless you somehow think Nurk/RoCo/Norman are worse players than Kanter/Aminu/Harkless, they've improved upon a WCF team."
"Here, I'll be pedantic for you  A Damian Lillard who plays 1/4 games injured is still slightly better than a healthy Kyrie.   Happy?"
"I don’t think it’s that simple at all. If it was more players would be doing it. He’s grabbed 105 offensive rebounds this year. More than Steph Curry, harden, Damian Lillard combined. You gonna tell me those were wide open and didn’t contribute to winning? even if you totally disregarded all his rebounds, he’s averaged 22 Points and 14 assists this year while going 15-5 which should be recognized and appreciated."
"We do know for certain, because it literally started the game[ after he got injured](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-plays-through-knee-pain-says-hes-just-dealing-stiffness-and) lmao. And then he sat out games due to a second injury (hamstring tendinopathy - same injury Harden has).   You think it's just a coincidence that Dame gets hurt, then suddenly plays like absolute shit? Come on now. Go look at his game log. If you actually watched him play, you'd know he didn't look right at all. Couldn't create any separation, couldn't make a layup, every 3 was short etc. He had no legs.  &gt;So curry not having cj kinda player to come play with the bench means we suck in the beginning of second and fourth then.  I mean, as do we lol. Just not *quite* as bad.  He's clearly not carrying better, because we have a better record. And we had a much better record early on when Dame had the worse roster around him too. Again, you can't just use on/off with zero context lol."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."

"At first I read this as, ""Damian Lillard with Trae Young's defense."" -_-"
no shit. i’m pointing out how it’s funny he’s calling out anthony davis for flopping when damian lillard flops too
funny you say that when your team has damian lillard lmao
"yeah and that’s why damian lillard isn’t involved as much off the ball as curry, not as active either. But he does have a decent amount of off ball action, thinking of the top shooting point guards how many are involved more off the ball than Dame?"
"I mean let's be real, apart from Damian Lillard pulling up from 35 feet for some reason,  or Dame Time, no one outside Oregon gives a flying fuck about the Blazers"
Damian Lillard and Trae Young - defense
1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Kevin Durant  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Joel Embiid  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard  this is the objective list. you cannot disagree with me
"Prime Jason Kidd. Kidd is one of the best pg defenders of his era, you could even put him on a 2 guard and have success because of his size, he's a better passer than Lillard too and a better rebounder, and can score if needed though he's not the best at creating his own shot off the dribble, and he never was a great 3pt threat, though he was quite decent at that during his second stint with the Mavs, but we're talking prime Jason Kidd, Kidd also threatened opposing teams from the low post, as you could see Nets running lots of plays with Kidd getting the ball in the post.  Taking all of that into account, I would rather have Jason Kidd as my point guard over Damian Lillard."
"* Zion Williamson and **Chris Paul**. CP3's playmaking can help open the floor for Zion, and he won't be taking shots away from him like other ball-dominant guards. Also, the lobs would be fun. Bam Adebayo is another good option, a solid secondary playmaker who can cover for Zion's defensive limitations thanks to his versatility.  * LaMelo Ball and **Nikola Jokic**. LaMelo has thrived this year thanks to Hornets' ball-sharing system, which lets him function as a playmaker and an off-ball threat. Jokic is the perfect fit for that, even if Melo/Jokic would be serviceable at best on defense. Of course, if Melo-Jokic pick and pops aren't your speed, Melo-Zion would also be fun, again because of lobs.  * Tyrese Haliburton and **Damian Lillard**. Hali doesn't iso a lot, usually having others set up his shots for him, but is a great playmaker. Dame can create his own shot with ease, but isn't a spectacular playmaker, and can be worn down if he has to have the ball in his hands on every possession. The strengths perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Hali and Steph would also be a really fun pairing, or Hali and Jimmy Butler."
Nick Fury is desperately trying to contact Damian Lillard rn
Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr. slander will not be tolerated.
"Never. At his absolute best you could maybe argue he was #5, but it's a bad argument. He was still behind Steph, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard and Westbrook. Then Irving, Wall, Thomas and Kemba are all debatable.  If you count Harden/Luka/LeBron as PGs then he's not top 7."
"He is still 9th in the league in scoring in the 4th over Damian Lillard who people consider to be one of the most clutch players. I don’t know where this narrative comes from, he misses a lot of clutch shots, but he also makes a lot too just like last night making 2 contested 3’s back to back with under 30 seconds left for example. I watch every single Wizards game so I’m wondering if you watch the games."

My hot take: Damian Lillard is and has been a better more complete player than Steph and it would be obvious to everyone if the opportunity and teams of each player were reversed.
1. Chris Paul  2. Damian Lillard  3. Giannis  4. James Harden (he'd be #1 if Durant wasn't on his team)  5. Paul George
Doubt Damian Lillard meant what he said. He was just being supportive. Westbrook with his 51 TS% (52.8 in regular season) in the playoffs is a top 2 pg? Please. What other than rebounding does Westbrook do better than CP3.
Damian Lillard literally just gave all of ESPN something to talk about for the next three weeks lmao
Both Harden and Irving are going to step away from the team making them untradeable and then the Nets will trade Joe Harris for Damian Lillard.  They've done it before.
Some random guy on Reddit named Skrong thinking he knows more about the NBA than Damian Fuckin Lillard. The balls on this guy
"Shannon: ""Skip, basketball is more than just about scoring right? KD might be a better scorer but LeBron is still the better overall rebounder, passer, and defender. How can you be the best player when you are only good at one thing while the other guy is better at everything else? Stop it Skip.""  Skip: ""My turn! \*slams table, sighs, sniffs\* You know my history with Damian Lillard, I think he's overrated in terms of basketball but he's definitely the best player rapper, I'll give you that. With that said, thank you Damian Lillard for telling the truth!!! I have been saying this for years now Kevin Durant is the best player in the world right now. Do you remember when he first came back from his injury a few weeks ago he scored 17 pts in 15 minutes off the bench. And let's look at what your man LeBron James did when he first came back last week against the Kings? He missed the game winner. And now he's out again. A few weeks ago he tweeted 'A storm is coming.', what storm? It's raining cats and dogs at Staples because the Lakers are in a big trouble. \*Blah blah blah about LeBron can't hit FT\*."""
"We lost our second and third best players to injury for half/most the season. We not only lost our starting SG and C but also our backup C/PF (gone for the whole season, maybe his career is over). Keeping in mind that the replacements we found for these guys are deeply flawed cast off pick ups. Damian Lillard carried us to the 4th seed (I think it was 4) before HE went down to injury for a stretch that saw us drop to 7th seed.  I'll admit I'm not aware of any of the teams ahead of us having nearly that level of sustained injury problem.  Nuggets lost Jamal for the rest of the season recently, but they also picked up Aaron Gordon.  Suns...who has been injured on the Suns?  Jazz...Injuries? Donovan Mitchell recently turned his ankle right? Out for a week? Have they had any major injuries?  Clips, I know you guys have enough talent to actually rest your players on back to backs and such. What kind of injuries have you had?  Not sure about the Mavs. Porzingas is probably hurt though.  Lakers, Obviously just recently Lebron and earlier this season AD for a while. So, while they have had injuries...again they also have actual talented basketball players to fill those gaps. Whereas we do shit like play our 10 day contract Rondae Hollis-Jefferson for significant minutes."

"We should get Damian Lillard, the most sensitive player in the league besides KD."
"the offense works. It's not the problem. Damian Lillard leading your offense means you probably have a top 5 offense in the league. Moving him away from the ball is not going to help anyone, Pairing him with a secondary playmaker who is a more flexible defender would probably make for a better back court though."
"&gt;""If Stotts can’t 'pull a rabbit out of his hat' with a playoff miracle of sorts, as one source put it, the Blazers are expected to opt for a new coaching voice,""  ""And the Damian Lillard timeline, it seems, is playing a big part here."""
"He’s at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He’s at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He’s at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn’t worth anything close to what he’s making. He’s turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don’t make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."

"The voting process for the All Team selections is pretty garbage. Like l stated, it's a popularity contest. There's no reason a guard like Jrue Holiday only has 2 All Defensive team selections when players all over the league (Damian Lillard, KD, JJ Reddick, Andre Igudola, etc.) say he's the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  Same thing with Jonathan Issac, Tony Allen for some early years, Jimmy Butler, Avery Bradley, AK-47, Robert Covington, and plenty of other players who were shafted in place of bigger names.  An NBA game is 48 minutes star players typically play 75% of that at 36mpg which is also where most of a games production occurs. If he is playing 20+ mpg  during productive stretches on the best team in his conference, which is also a title contender, l don't see how he isn't in the conversation. He plays ~10 minutes less than Ben (DPOY candidate) and Joel (an MVP candidate). That's less than a game's quarter. He has a plus / minus that shows his impact and it's all on the defensive end.  Dejounte Murray played roughly the same amount when he was selected. Tony Allen and PatBev had similar minutes as well in their years.  Don't look at other NBA outlets and analyst, see what the people he guards say about his defense. I presented the stats now go listen to his peers."
what’s your opinion on Damian Lillard
"Ironic statement about a guy who averages the most assists in the league and has less of a usage rate then Luka, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving Damian Lillard, and about 10 other guys."

Damian Lillard does not like this post.
"Detoit got a less than once in a generation championship without a superstar by building close to the perfect team without a star and peaking at exactly the right time. That team was incredible, but it's not a consistent model for a champion. We've seen teams like them fall short in every other instance, like the mid 2010s Paces and Bulls. The Heat's first championship was definitely due to terrific team building, but they also benefited from Shaq being willing to be traded to them. Dallas is the model you're looking for; getting excellent value in the draft and free agency, making the right trades at the right times, and making several runs and hoping one of them wins you a ring. The issue is that is really, really fucking hard to do (just ask Damian Lillard or Anthony Davis). It's much easier to do a hard rebuild for a few yeas (or in the Spurs case, completely tank for one year after your star gets injured) than it is to take 10 shots at the 15th pick and hope to nab a Giannis."
yeah and without Damian Lillard it's a shitshow

I'm still pissed Portland didn't offer CJ McCollum for Harden. Houston made an offer but Portland refused it. Imagine Damian Lillard and James Harden on the Blazers.
"Interesting that you bring up 2011 because I saw a good comparison of Dirk and Carmelo Anthony one time. That Melo at his peak was arguably a top 7 player or so, and the question was could he be the best player on a championship team? And they said similar to Dirk in 2011, he doesn’t just fit ANY team, but if a team were expertly crafted around Carmelo Anthony, The author said he could be  I think a similar fact about Damian Lillard is true. This current iteration of the blazers isn’t a title contender, but that isn’t his fault. He’s dealt with injuries the last two years to his team, and they’re still on a 48 win pace over an 82 game season.  If he had an elite defensive center and shooting, basically replace Mitchell on the Jazz with him, then that’s a title contender. Or if he had a great wing to run with who also was a good passer, someone like Jaylen Brown, then yeah.   I think he definitely could be the best player on a finals team. It’s just so hard to build that team."
"this is quite literally the first comment i've ever made about dame being injured in probably 8 years of being active on this subreddit. yAlL cOmE uP wItH sOmE bUlLsHiT i watched the dude messing with his knee on the sideline with the trainer.   https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2021/03/damian-lillard-ruled-out-for-portland-trail-blazers-game-friday-at-orlando-with-knee-contusion.html  &gt;“It’s just been bruised ever since that game,” Lillard said following the win over Miami. “I feel like I haven’t been able to be as shifty and change speeds and explode, as well. And then tonight, I got kneed in my right one, which I also got kneed in earlier in the season, I think in New York. It’s been tender since then.

"Damian Lillard on/off netrtg: +4.5  Curry on/off netrtg: +17.6  All of the adjusted on/off stats like rpm, raptor, pipm, etc say the same thing. Curry is carrying a much worse team."
"&gt; That it's the same for Lillard is not really relevant since he's not the one with the MVP  And since when winning MVP means that you have to win? Karl Malone, Charles Barkley and Steve Nash didn't, why with a 6-3 point guard would be any different?  &gt; Russ is actually ""supposed to be"" the better player, according to basic stats and accolades  He was, in his prime, but he isn't anymore. That's like saying that Derrick Rose should be a better player and have more expectations than Damian Lillard right now because he's won an MVP, Russ isn't in his prime anymore, ofc Dame is better. Dame is younger and plays a style of game that is conducive to doing well into his 30s, Russ is 32 and always relied on his freakish athletecism."

Damian Lillard was the best player on a team that went to the conference finals. Russ is going to be the Robin of the Washington fucking Wizards.
"Define win, because Damian Lillard has been bounced in the first round in 3 of the last 4 years, played like horse shit when he made the WCF and doesn't get 1% of the criticism that Russ does.  There isn't a guard in this league that has led a bad team to the NBA Finals, in fact there isn't a player not named LeBron that has done so and even LeBron did it in an awful Conference."

As long as they remember to trap Damian Lillard they won't lose against the Blazers
Jesus... the two Nets picks in the 2012 draft became Damian Lillard (Gerald Wallace trade) and Draymond?
"All time, no idea. But I know we traded Gerald Wallace for what would become Damian Lillard"
"&gt; the lack of competitiveness in players bothers me more than anything, and I don't know how I would handle that as a coach  He’s right. There is absolutely no more competitiveness in today’s NBA. It’s all about being buddies buddies with the opposition and your teammates, it’s disgusting to see. The Kobe (Rest in Peace), and the MJ types of attitudes are very rare nowadays, the only stars I can think of with those attitudes are Draymond himself, Westbrook and Damian Lillard. Trash talking is long gone, and with today’s refs, you probably get ejected for trash talking. The game has gone soft, there is no longer any competitiveness, and it’s truly not only shameful, but unfortunate and disgraceful."

"TIL Westbrook is responsible for the emergence of Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard wants to trade careers with him, he basically is Oscar Robertson reincarnated, and above all IF there are any shortcomings in his career they are all other people's fault  Lol wtf is this propaganda?"
"&gt;Dear Diary,  &gt;Today I wrote a paragraph defending my Hero, Damian 'Dame Time' Lillard. I love you Damian, you'll always be cooler than Harden in my heart.  &gt; xoxoxo"
well when damian lillard was the 2nd option he was significantly worse than kyrie
"You clearly aren’t using the same criteria to judge that post as the one you initially commented! That states expect to make the HOF if their career continues whereas people are claiming Damian Lillard and Kyle Lowry should be in based off current accomplishments. I don’t know why you felt the need to comment when it was a personal question on how I would redesign or reallocate the HOF, I assume it’s because I mentioned the star player on your team but it’s really illogical."
Why was Damian lillard there?
"I dunno about strong argument for Top 10. Definitely gta add Jerry West, Walt Frazier, Bob Cousy, Jason Kidd, Damian Lillard, etc. to that list. Is Westbrook in over any of those guys?"
&gt;Damian Lillard and Kyle Lowry  That sure is a funny way of spelling Nikola Jokic!
They’re in yet but I would kick out Damian Lillard and Kyle Lowry who should be in according to this subreddit
"Kyrie has played NINE games without LeBron in the playoffs, you can't simply exclude all the data from his playing time with LeBron to fit your argument.  Damian Lillard has as many series shooting under 20% from 3 as he has series shooting over 45% from the field, he's simply not a good playoff performer, but people think that he is because of two shots and a series against the Thunder. Dame has also shot under 40% from the FIELD in 4 out of his 11 playoff series, Kyrie on the other hand has never lost a first round playoff game and has twice had all-time great Finals series."
"Or well, not shooting 18% from 3 when he has the opportunities would also help. Dame is the most overprotected superstar player in the league by a mile because of his loyalty and game winning shots, dude has stunked up in every playoff elimination series since 2014. Instead of blaming Stotts and his teammates, let's just admit that Portland's problem is that their best player isn't as good as people want to make him out to be.  Damian Lillard has shot under 40% from the field (four times) in a playoff series more times than he has shot over 45% (twice), in fact Dame has shot under 20% from 3 twice in playoff series and that's in 11 series played total for his career, he's just not a good playoff performer that gets a pass in the regular season due to halfcourt 3 pointers.  But whatever, Portland fans will downvote me and say that i'm hating when the reality is that Dame is a slightly better version of Kyrie Irving, but without the playoff success."
Paul pierce career wise is better than Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson

The sheer panic Damian Lillard causes when he comes around a screen is kinda hilarious
"lol idc about his offense in a starting lineup with damian lillard, cj mccollum, and hopefully jusuf nurkic (who knows with these injuries) he's needed for his defense.   portland was essentially matching the clippers bucket for bucket, but still down by multiple scores because they couldn't get a single stop."
"1 and 2 are Number 24 Kobe and Number 8 Kobe. Then in no particular order Damian Lillard, Allan Iverson, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Arvydas Sabonis, and Spud Webb."

"probably damian lillard.   yeah, i went there."
"Gary ""Get that garbage outta here"" Trent JR looking like Damian Lillard with that shot."
"Jusuf Nurkic yelled, “There you go!” CJ McCollum gave a look of pleasant surprise. Norman Powell belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Damian Lillard hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"

"Welcome to the Nets, Damian Lillard."
"&gt; I don’t think they are. Nash never averaged more than 4.7 3 point attempts a game, he would double that easily today   Are you crazy? doubt 4.7 is 9.4, and the only guys shooting more than 9.4 3s a game are Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, and Buddy Hield. Steph and Dame are among the very greatest 3 point shot creators of all time (vast majority of Nash's 3s are assisted catch and shoot), and Buddy Hield is a 3pt specialist whose only role on the court is to run around and shoot 3s."
In the playoffs he elevates his game. His last playoff appearance he was a 6th seed on the pelicans and locked up damian lillard on the 3rd seeded blazers on his way to sweeping them. He averaged 24/6/6 on 52/32/75... I have no idea where you get this idea. Perhaps your just talking out of your ass?

like 90% of their possessions are high PnR with Damian Lillard. It really doesn’t matter which guard picks him up first because if they fight over the screen Dame will just get 3 FTs so you have no other option than have the big step up out there to contain and occasionally switch. If you look at the games Dame excels in it’s when the blazers are against a slow footed big
"I think if ""taking bad shots but actually making them"" counts as ""bad selection"", then Damian Lillard, not that much taller, kinda counts too. He, like, doesn't take the kind of shot that you normally would half of the time sometimes. He can still make the shots and have a good game.  I wonder about Jokić. His shots are still so awkard often. But this season he's making them, usually. I'm not sure if that means he's changed into a guy who makes them, or just is way more lucky recently than in previous seasons."
"Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic. Damian Lillard. Basically guys who haven’t won enough."
Why does literally everyone DESPISE Damian Lillard?

Reminder that nba.com has Damian Lillard at the #2spot over Giannis. Fckin disrespectful.
Damian Lillard talking about OKC
"There hasn't been a whole lot of parity in the league like there was in the 70s. Instead you have teams that go to multiple finals, back to back championships, even three-peats. We've got dinasties and the greatest teams (and players) in nba history dominating.  Chuck, Karl Malone, John Stockton had to face Michael Fucking Jordan and the Bulls, a team that three-peated on two separate occasions.  AI ended up having to face the dominant Kobe-Shaq Lakers who'll end up three-peating. That decade, in the west, ended up being dominated by the Lakers and Spurs. Also why Steve Nash doesn't have a ring.  And then you have the Big Three Celtics, the Big Three Miami. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant weren't going to beat *that* Miami team.   And then the later half of the decade, you got a team that just broke the record for the best ever regular season record. And then the next year they add one of the greatest scorers ever to their roster. So it's not exactly crazy that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Damian Lillard weren't going to get to the finals having to go through them  And of course you've got LeBron going to the finals every year, Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan's biggest obstacle in the east.  The point is only one team gets the chip. Out of 30. And we've been seeing the same all-time great teams stopping so many MVP-caliber players from getting a ring.   The NBA community's gotten to a cancerous point where players aren't appreciated for their greatness. Instead all we wanna talk about is all time rankings, which is why the media and fans have put so much value on rings.   And then the media wanna complain why these superteams are formed? And then they're gonna talk about how great players like Brodie don't have a ring?? Like damn. Look at the competition they're facing."

"&gt; most of the reason he fell to 16 was that teams knew he would struggle to play due to anxiety tho. he would have gone top 5 easily  This is just revisionist history.  In a draft with Anthony Davis, MKG (lol), Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond, and Harrison Barnes -- all of whom were one and done elite prospects -- as well as Dion Waiters and Damian Lillard, no one was going to pick 21 year-old Royce White in the top 5.  And Thomas Robinson, the actual Player of the Year in White's conference, was also picked ahead of him.  He was a fringe top 10 pick with no baggage."

"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."
"Wait, Lillard AND Dame both hit series game winners? My guy Damian so clutch his first and last names can dominate a series on their own lol"

"Damian Lillard, Devin Booker, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Myles Turner.  That's a mighty fine team in my opinion."
"Holy Liaison is damian lillard, got it."
"Ah yes, Damian ""did I mention how fucking humble and loyal I am"" Lillard.  I'm already preparing myself for the exact same quote next week"
This is such a ridiculous argument.. the warriors without KD were a 73-9 team. To act like the warriors were pre Miami before Lebron is the dumbest thing I’ve seen Damian Lillard haters say.
Have you not seen ESPN covering Dame? Anytime they talk about him they always add that “So how can Damian Lillard win with Portland?” and the answer always comes out to be “LEAVE PORTLAND”. It’s frustrating to watch because they want a big market to pry Dame from our hands when he’s the greatest franchise player we’ve had.
"Yeah. If he had a ring and was talking like this that would be one thing, but like let’s keep it a buck:   Never in the Damian Lillard era has this team even been a contender. Their crowning achievement of making the conference finals was them getting swept by the warriors WITHOUT KD.  I’m not trying to go in on dude but it’s just silly. He’s the Reggie Miller of our era, he should stay in his lane here."
"You are throwing statlines with points, rebounds, assists and TS% to make your point that Draymond is good at defense, like ????  Draymond Green has never successfully guarded Damian Lillard in his life, in fact they so rarely switch into one another, that you could probably find every clip of him ""trying"" to guard Dame."
If youo want damian lillard youre gunna have to give up a lot more than just jrue holiday
I just watched Damian Lillard go one man offense trying to keep his team afloat….  Not sure adding a guy that will keep him as a one man offense helps
Ben Simmons better start looking at real estate out in Portland. Because he making it easier and easier for them trade his butt for Damian lillard they have to utilize embiid NOW it’s no telling how long embiid with this much of a threat . Simmons is gone man

"&gt;It is like you are not thinking things through before posting them.  Okay, let's recap real fast.  &gt;read the box score FFS...  Your rebuttal to someone who you felt didn't watch the game.   &gt;In performance he can be better under the right system.  You claiming he can be better than Lebron and KD if he just had the right system. Any team you build around Giannis would be worse than just swapping him for either of those two.  &gt;Bigs do not need a bag  Lmao spoken like a true casual.  &gt;Giannis is and plays like a championship calliber big  Yet he has never even carried to the ECF and has had better teams than players like Damian Lillard or James Harden had in which they also carried in a more difficult conference.  &gt;Nobody else his size is as skilled in the current league.  This is really where you exposed yourself.  &gt;Most ultra athletic people are not volume scorers from 5ft in.  No amount of bball ref scouring will support your idiotic claims. You are the one reaching and you have not disproven a single claim of mine. All you did was expose yourself as someone who either has no idea what they're saying or someone who is trolling. Either way don't bother replying, I've had my laughs and at this point, it just feels like I'm bullying you so I will stop now. Have a nice one!"
"Wait, you dont think Kemba, Langford and Nesmith are going to get you Damian Lillard?"

Get Damian Lillard on this team stat!
&gt;The bucks need to get Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard.
I don't necessarily agree. I think the rise of shooting has made non insane athletes just so much more valuable.  Like even a guy like Khris Middleton without the 3pt shot would be a 16-20ppg guy despite his 50% shooting on long 2s. But now he is easily an all-star talent.  The thing is you could probably go to 35-40 players now who deserve to be all-stars. I think each team should be 15 players so double the all-nba players.  Damian Lillard goes from an efficient high volume scorer to a guy who isn't amazing at the rim and is league average at midrange and therefore probably pretty inefficient. James Harden about half of his scoring is gone. And his passing would be less valuable with fewer 3pt shooters.
"Man I feel bad for Damian Lillard, dude had a 1st Team worthy season. At this point, either 2 or 3 guards should be allowed because the guard position is so strong."

That is Damian Lillard game 5 Klay game 6 levels of hot take right there
Damian “Cruise” Lillard is about to engage in some not so friendly fire

The problem is Portland is going drop the phone as soon as they say Damian Lillard
"My personal list  1. Magic Johnson 2. John Stockton 3. Isaiah Thomas 4. Chris Paul 5. Steve Nash 6. Steph Curry (best scorer out of them, but not the best ""Point Guard"") 7. Jason Kidd 8. Gary Payton 9. Nate Archibald 10. Damian Lillard (same boat as Curry)"
People forget but Nash eventually retired because he suffered nerve damage in his leg following a collision with Damian Lillard in Lillard's NBA debut.

“Heres how the Lakers can acquire Trail Blazers superstar Damian Lillard in blockbuster deal”
"And we have a guy like Damian Lillard be on the Trailblazers his whole career, and someone like Steph and Klay on the Warriors their whole career.   So how are things different, especially considering staying with your team for your entire career was a rare thing to do in the mid 2000’s as well."
"There aren't many point guards left who are true floor generals, guys playing three dimensional chess with that next level understanding and have the ability to be that guy on the court consistently. Who are thinking beyond what they're supposed to do, knowing what everyone else should do, communicating well, motivating, knowing when feed the right guy, knowing when to take over, etc.  The only guards that fit that next level of floor general right now and have the ability to take full advantage of it are Chris Paul and Steph Curry (they have completely different styles of play, but they are always completely in control of the game). Damian Lillard is close, but doesn't move without the ball or pass as well as those two guys. There are a few guys like Marcus Smart or Andre Iguadola or even Draymond Green that understand the game well enough, but don't quite have the skill level to be that guy consistently every night. Those guys are invaluable teammates though. Luka, LeBron, and Jokic aren't technically guards, but some people might put them in the conversation as basketball becomes positionless so I could see an argument for each of them. Chris Paul really is a throwback though.   Paige Buekers, Sabrina Ionescu and Diana Taurasi fit that mold on the ladies side. You have to be really smart, but you also have to see the game of basketball in a way where you kinda always feel like you are in the zone and then have all the skills necessary to get the best shot for you or your teammates in any situation. It's knowing when your teammates get hot, what shots they prefer, where they like to catch the basketball for a catch and shoot 3 versus a curl to the basket. It's next level things that even in the NBA only a handful of guys are capable of seeing and then having the skill to execute. There are a bunch of NBA role players who have very limited athleticism, can't shoot outside ten feet, yet they got to the league and can dominate within that role just by having that level of understanding, they make incredible teammates. You need those players to win championships. Chris Paul is on another level though."
So like Damian Lillard?

"Do you reckon there are insurance policies written on the contract of a player which payout during the even of a major injury? Perhaps the premium on such policies for players like Cousins, Embiid, and Davis are higher than say those on players like Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic. And on another hand, some players' contracts are so valuable that the premiums are probably high just because of the contract value such as Giannis or Lebron, you know?"
"I heard people trying to get that going for Damian Lillard, which would make waaaay more sense. Cold blooded in the 4th and wears 0"
"Ben Taylor, the creator of Thinking Basketball, has a metric called PlayVal, which is described as ""Playmaking value, an estimate of a player’s points per 100 impact from playmaking only.""  According to this metric for the 2020-21 season (regular season), the top 10 players for this stat are:  1. James Harden 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Trae Young 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damian Lillard 6. Chris Paul 7. LeBron James 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Jimmy Butler 10. DeMar DeRozan"
"Damian Lillard supporters are just like Damian Lillard. When he does well they puff their chest out and yell ""I told you so!"" And when he doesn't play well they don't say shit.  Nobody ever said he wasn't talented. But we all know the reason this stat line is noteworthy is because nobody would have been surprised to see him play terrible tonight. He just isn't consistent, and we need to accept that about him."
"I genuinely don’t understand how “Giannis has poor touch around the rim” has become such a commonly accepted opinion. I don’t even really know how to argue against it because it’s so plainly not true on every level. Don’t even need to tell people to watch games or anything, it’s pretty obvious on a stat sheet too.  We may as well be saying Damian Lillard is a mediocre shooter or LeBron isn’t an accurate passer."
"Hehehe , that’s not fair, thats not my joke , Chuck said this joke on air on NBA on TNT with the help of Kenny .   The 2nd part is also not fair because i was stating facts , Black athletes has a certain life style so when i say a player like Damian Lillard can’t be couched by a female, it’s not because it’s bad or mot good , it’s because all those athletes have never been couched by a woman before.  You guys always take the wrong train to twist words ."
- Damian Lillard
Our point guard is Damian Lillard
"[Wojnarowski] Portland has agreed to trade star guard Damian Lillard to the Trailblazers for CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Jusuf Nurkic, and 3 first round picks."
"The second point is wrong, Damian Lillard holds the record for 3's in a series with 35 (set two weeks ago)."
"There's no way for the Portland Trail Blazers to make the NBA Finals with Damian Lillard as their centerpiece. If your goal as an executive is to win a title, you have to put out feelers for rebuild packages. If your goal as an executive *includes but is not limited to* winning a title, you can hold pat and know that you have a borderline superstar who will represent the community and put butts in seats and make your team competitive.   Those are just two different things, not inherently better than the other despite how a fan might look at it, but two different things all the same.   I happen to think r/nba slightly overrates Damian Lillard, but hey, that's life. I think he can be a #1 on a team *perfectly* built for him and a #1A/#1B on a standard contender."
"Good luck to the Blazers finding another ""Damian Lillard"" someday..."
You include him in a package for Damian Lillard while calling him a bum.  That doesn't make any sense.
"&gt;we have to consider the possibility of Dame missing playoffs in 2017 via play ins as well.  Dame had a play in game versus that very same Memphis team last year actually. But the Blazers won.  &gt;Draymond has absolutely 0 scoring ability besides cutting. Even if he is not, the Lillard's cast was undeniably better than Steph's.  You're acting like defense doesn't exist. The Blazers were the **29th** ranked defense. The Warriors were 5th. It's not like Curry vs Lillard is the reason for that difference lol. Defense wins games too.  For the record, our roster was also worse than the Warriors for half the season anyway. We played 30 games without either CJ or Nurkic. Our 2nd best player was GTJ....who scored less points a game on worse efficiency than Wiggins. And we were 30-20 when they came back in spite of that.  &gt;Facilitating  What's the argument for Steph as a facilitator? Dame created way way more points per game with his passing than Steph did. Hell Steph wasn't even the primary playmaker for his own team. Dame had to be the primary playmaker *and* the primary scorer.   &gt;I am going to need stats proof on this (burden of proof is on you).  [Here you go](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/#!?VsPlayerID=203110&amp;PlayerID=201939&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)  Curry with Draymond (~1700 minutes): 50/45/91 splits/ 67.9% TS% (+6.9)  Curry without Draymond (~420 minutes): 41/**31**/94 splits / 56.5% TS% (-3.2)   Obviously the sample isn't enormous - though 400+ minutes is hardly nothing - but there's a reason the Warriors tried to pair Curry and Draymond up rather than stagger them. Both of them heavily depend on the other. Curry gets trapped and can't beat the trap without Draymond, and Draymond's passing is useless without Curry   &gt;Curry averaged 3 more points on 3TS% more. That's definitely not being as every bit as good.   Which is primarily from Dame tanking his stats by playing through injury this season (whereas Steph sat out when he got hurt). Dame [hurt his knee against Dallas](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-plays-through-knee-pain-says-hes-just-dealing-stiffness-and) but tried to play through the injury because we're obviously trash without him. It didn't work, and he eventually had to miss 3 games to rest up. He was averaging 31/8 on 65% TS% (aka, like exactly the same scoring as Steph) outside of that injured stretch of 22/7 on 53% TS%, which is obviously not Dame. And he kept that scoring up after he got back and through the playoffs"
"&lt; 6'2 Donovan Mitchell and Damian Lillard have the 2nd (57 pts) and 3rd (55 pts) most points made in a playoff loss *EVER.*  Lol, behind Michael Jordan's 60.  What's even more absurd is that Mitchell pulled that craziness in 11 minutes less playtime than Jordan and 10 minutes less than Dame.  6'6 is no doubt the magic number but exceptions very much exist and it's happened literally within the past year.  3-pt era yadi yada but those two are still regular height humans.  (wingspan + hands different story 😆)"
"Damian Lillard and Nikola Jokic are the first players to combine for 150 points! Unfortunately, JR Smith figured they must be winning with how much points those guys scored and dribbled out the clock.."

Yeah everyone knows the last thing damian lillard needs to be surrounded with is defenders not offense like portlands been doing  dantoni will do great in portland lmfao
Portland should've easily won that series. Damian Lillard is literally Jokic's defensive kryptonite. He was out there to exploit for 40 MPG and they still lost.
Damian Lillard died for this
"Quick Run down:  NBA essentially set into motion the initial NA lockdown of covid-19 after Gobert (Jazz Center) tested positive. The season was delayed until late July where the NBA setup a Bubble in Orlando, Florida with 22-23(?) teams. Essentially all the teams within playoff contention. They played 8 games in the bubble and then the play-in games commenced for the 8/9 seeds. In this case it was Portland/Memphis, as they were within 4 games of each other, with Portland winning and claiming the 8 seed. The only 2 noteworthy points during the pre-playoff bubble was the Suns 8-0 perfect run as they missed the play-in games by a single game, and Damian Lillard going absolutely nuclear. The Bubble playoffs were interesting as all playoffs go.   Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray went toe-to-toe in the first round, with the Nugs edging out the Jazz in 7.  The Chris Paul led OKC Thunder took Houston with Westbrook and Harden to 7, and nearly took it. Harden had a game saving block on Lu Dort to move on to the 2nd round.  Aside from that the first round was fairly boring.  In the second round the 5th seeded Heat surprised everyone and knocked out the Giannis led bucks in 5.   Boston and Toronto went to 7, with Boston taking it in the end.  The Clippers blew a 3-1 lead over the Nuggets.  Conference Finals ended up being fairly easy for both winners, as the Lakers won in 5 over Denver, and the Heat won in 6 over Boston.  In the Finals, the Lakers took it in 6 over the Heat.  That’s the rundown for last season’s end/playoffs. You could probably piece this season together through the almanac and other articles. Hope I could help, and welcome back!"
Damian Lillard VS Logan Paul?
"in 2020 the West was honestly one of the weakest it had ever been. Damian Lillard did a serious carry job carrying a really really bad Portland roster as the 8th seed. Then they played a much worse version of the Houston Rockets with WB, maybe it looked good for one series, but they literally almost lost to OKC in 7 and they got easily swept out by the Lakers. Then Denver upset LAC to make the finals only to barely be competitive vs. the Lakers and Jokic is constantly in foul trouble every game.   The finals were not bad, but everyone knows that it could've ended in 5 just as easily. Miami was a legit team although by the time they hit the finals they were obviously exhausted and a ton of players were injured. Jimmy had to literally have the two best games of his career to get them to be competitive.   The West is just going to be ever more competitive from now on. Phoenix is legit, LAC will always be in the playoff discussion even if they lose Kawhi, PG13 was at one point the single superstar on a contending Pacers team. A big question mark is will Portland go all in or will they trade Dame. Regardless Denver is going to get better next year with Murray, Utah has become the ultimate version of the best team they could possibly be. GSW will be better next year too with Klay back, and they are very much capable of making moves this off-season. Memphis young core will be better too. Oh and then there's the Pels and their young stars and core along with the Kings who were bubbling up and SAS who were a play-in team. Minnesota will also show a ton of improvement next year with their big 3 healthy. It's going to be harder and LeBron is only getting worse. This playoffs it was obvious how much his athleticism has declined. LeBron in 2018 compared to LeBron in 2021 is probably the biggest difference yet. I mean everyone saw how much he struggled to guard even Cam Payne driving to the rim, he's literally the slowest he's ever been and his explosiveness takes SO much more. It really started off in the bubble but he was able to hide it by being a pass first player. LeBron could very well be a floor general but he needs a true elite scoring option like how CP3 and Book have worked together. The difference is that Book can score from anywhere, AD is a big and can only score in the paint."
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
"“Wrecking their future”…. I don’t mean to be negative man. I love watching Damian Lillard play, but if his best achievement is causing a 1st round exit for the Thunder only to lose in the 2nd round then that sucks… I know you guys love him, but from an outsiders perspective it seems like he’s your Russell Westbrook. Like it might be time to let him go and rebuild if you guys want a ring and he wants a ring. Again, that’s an outsiders POV, so I could be wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️"
You can blame Damian Lillard for keeping Terry's job as long as he did. Everyone knows he should've been gone after the New Orleans series. And then 2019 WCF happened.
"I'm not saying he's a bad player, he distinctly does make his shots a lot harder than they have to be very frequently, though.  And again, for as much as people like to circle jerk about how he finishes so well and the english he puts on his lay-ups and all that crap, he actually shoots a worse % at the rim than Damian Lillard and Steph Curry do (and yet somehow people act like Dame can't finish at the cup).  Kyrie also takes more of his shots from inefficient areas of the floor, so even though he had a 50/40/90 season his TS% is lower than Damian Lillard's despite the fact that Dame has so much more defensive attention and has to carry a heavier load than Kyrie.  All those guys you mentioned are highly skilled and have used that skill to be as efficient as possible.  They all can &amp; do take &amp; make tough shots because they have to, but none of them relish it like Kyrie does.  Kyrie is hunting for those looks, Steph/Dame will take them out of desperation but otherwise use their considerable skills to get something better.  Look at the way he's played against the Bucks, Kyrie is taking lots of bad shots &amp; his TS% for the series is .524.  Also he's only taken 2 FTs across 3 games because he avoids contact like I avoid diet &amp; exercise.  Again, I am not trying to say Kyrie is a bad player, just that he sneakily has terrible shot selection and that if he didn't go for tough mid-range Js or impossible lay-ups he'd score more and actually be as good as everyone thinks he is."
"You're delusional if you think current Damian Lillard &amp; Luka Doncic aren't better than 22-year-old Derrick Rose.  I love Derrick Rose but if you slot him (his 2011 MVP self) into the current Blazers/Mavericks teams, those 2 teams aren't doing jack shit."
Rudy Gobert is a top 10 player and is more valuable than Damian Lillard
"if this keeps up it's going to be: Damian ""Joe Ingles"" Lillard"
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"

Damian Lillard experience*
Joe 'Damian 'James Harden' Lillard' Ingles
Joe 'Damian Lillard' Ingles
I think his trash talk to Damian Lillard and being overly confident last season had a lot to do with it. The Cancun on 3 trash talk specifically.
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"Your basically saying that it's ok if a team is a ""super team"" if the owners put it together but if a player exercises his rights thru free agency its somehow different? That's pretty stupid... KG said in his hall of fame speech that his only regret was not leaving Minnesota earlier. He would have multiple rings if he left earlier. If Damian Lillard stays in Portland he probably wont win anything because what I've come to realize over the years is that GM's care more about selling tickets than actually putting together winning teams. There are more James Dolan type owners than Mark Cuban types who are willing to make good moves for the team. Why should a player waste his prime on a team that isn't willing to get him some type of help? Also it seems like when it comes to this subject people only criticize players that they dont like... If Lillard leaves after 8 years it will probably be ok but when lebron left CLE it's a problem"
Damian Lillard is just a shit Stephen Curry aka Mr. First Round Exit.
"Yeah, just like people remember AI’s legendary 2001 MVP season and the run to the Finals + that iconic game 1 performance and step over. Or the Pacers/Knicks rivalry and Reggie’s clutch performances. You can go on and on too.  Damian Lillard very well might not win a championship in his career in Portland, but you can’t say that his time there wasn’t meaningful and special. Blazers fans will probably remember those playoff game winners and the other clutch moments he delivered for the rest of their lives."
"Lol when we're shit they start saying stuff like, ""okay so here's how we can trade Nick Young and Luol Deng for Damian Lillard and get back in the playoff race."""
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"“Did Damian Lillard purposely throw the playoffs to avoid hate when he asks out?”  Obviously, this one is contingent on dame never actually asking out"
"why, your going to be in the same postion as this year. Cj and Dame backcourt cant get it done, what can you trade Cj for to make this work? You ideally need a elite wing. Theres only 8 wings i would trade him for, 4 of which he doesnt come close to in value so its basically Paul george,Middleton, Ingram, Grant? I would do the trade for Mpj if they can make salaries match dont see it being beinfical to the nuggets tho, Porter is on his rookie deal and trading for Cj would make a lethal back court but Mpj fits that team really well. In conclusion we will be back here next year shitting on whatever coach is in portland and telling Damian Lillard to ask for a trade."
"Jokic: ""Look at me. *I'm* Damian Lillard now."""
Damian Lillard scored 10 points in game 4 versus Denver and Portland won that game 115 - 95.
Mom can we have Damian Lillard? We have Damian Lillard at home. Damian Lillard at home:
"first of all youre making a laker fan defend damian lillard… truly remarkable     second of all, you realize when you obsessively hate on a player like this it looks kinda creepy right? i’d say the same about people who obsessively hate on lebron, trae, westbrook… chill tf out"
Currently - Damian Lillard    All time - Larry Bird
"Your best player has to be able to space the floor at least just a little bit. Look at the top ten players in the NBA.  Lillard, Embiid, AD, Bron, Luka, Curry, KD, Kawhi, Jokic, Harden, etc., can all shoot or spread the floor in some way. Giannis can't. He might get streaky and some shots fall in for him but teams will live with that every time. If the Bucks are to do anything different, it won't be because of Giannis changing his game because Giannis really only knows how to play one way. He's a taller version of Westbrook, IMO.   Giannis needs a dominant guard who can shoot the ball. If I were the Bucks, I would be making phone calls trying to get Damian Lillard on the team. Losing Donte was also huge for the Bucks. One less shooter who can also create and play good defense. On paper, Bucks should be winning."
"&gt; 1999 Lakers? didn't even have 3 All-Stars  Shaq, Kobe, Glenn Rice. And you can't go with ""He doesn't count because he wasn't an all-star that year, even though he had been the three previous years"", since with Detroit you emphasized how that exact year wasn't as important as the years leading up to it.  &gt; 3 established stars acquired through trades/FA is a superteam.   Why are we suddenly pretending there's no difference between a star and a superstar?  Nick Vucevic, Julius Randle, and Paul George would not be a superteam.  Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard would be."
I don't think its big dumb to want him on your team. But saying you'd much rather have him on your team than Damian fucking Lillard is some homer goggles crazy talk.
You are not getting Damian Lillard without including Jaylen Brown. He's your most valuable trade asset and trading him is your best chance at building a contender. Tatum+Lillard is a top 2 seed and immediate contender where as with Brown you risk being a very mediocre .500 basketball team. Floor and ceiling rises significantly. If I'm the celtics I'm doing everything I can to move Brown for Lillard IF dame actually wants out
Everyone not named Damian Lillard was invisible?
I don’t watch him all the time but his videos on Damian Lillard like this one &amp; Giannis from several months back were very good.   Haven’t read his books so I can’t speak on those but the reputation around him really distracts people from what good things he has to say is all.
Wardell set a playoff record for points in a sweep in the WCF vs the strongest team Damian Lillard has had. Stop it.
Lebron AD take up over half their cap. Adding Kawhi or Damian Lillard (both of which will certainly not happen) will fill their cap almost to the point where they can’t afford any players that are worth minutes (they could maybe sneak in 2 or 3) but teams need more than 6 players worth minutes to play a season.
"For Damian Lillard, the main issue is actually trading for him. The Lakers gave up pretty much all their assets in the Davis trade so there is no reason the Blazers would even answer a phone call from the Lakers. With Kawhi, it is possible for it to happen technically through a sign and trade and a bit of contract restructuring like waiving role players but again, the Clippers would never do a sign and trade with the Lakers so it’s not really possible nor do I think either of those players want to play for the Lakers. So in conclusion, even though Lakers fans want something like that to happen, it won’t ever happen."
"There is zero way that Terry Stotts gets significantly more out of this roster. Sabonis is maybe a second option at best, and their second best player is who? Levert? Brogdon?   I could see them fighting for the eighth seed but even then barring a big shakeup in the East, who’s picking Brogdon/Sabonis/Levert over Beal/Westbrook, the jays, or Butler/Bam?  Their best shot is a Knicks regression but I think the Knicks are probably gonna be active in free agency. Indiana just flat out needs a better roster if they wanna keep up in the East. Stotts is a solid coach but he also had Damian Lillard the last 8 years, nobody on this Pacers roster can sniff him talent wise"
"That's not Dame's fault though, he's been surrounded by mediocrity his entire career. He's carried what's essentially a lottery team to the playoffs year in and year out and he's arguably the best clutch shooter in the game. There are plenty of HOF players with no rings and no MVPs. Let's do a little comparison.  Chris Mullen (HOF):  18.2 PPG  4.1 RPG  3.5 APG  5 time All Star  1 time All NBA First Team  2 time All NBA Second Team  1 time All NBA Third Team  0 championships  0 MVPs  0 scoring titles    Damian Lillard:  24.7 PPG  4.2 RPG  6.6 APG  6 time All Star  1 time All NBA First Team  4 time All NBA Second Team  1 time All NBA Third Team  0 championships (as of now)  0 MVPs (as of now)  0 scoring titles (as of now)  Note that Dame just turned 31 so he is only going to add to his accolades. He will likely have another 3 All Star appearances at least and a couple more All NBA teams under his belt. If Chris Mullen is a HOFer, Dame is a lock."
I don’t think Damian Lillard has even been a finalist for MVP in his entire career so I’m not sure how he fits the superstar description you are prescribing to. Luka hasn’t either but the trajectory of his career moving upwards still helps him. Damian Lillard is 31 and hasn’t even finished top 3 in MVP voting to my knowledge. He has as likely a chance to win MVP as PG or Kyrie do tbh.
"Damian Lillard, Trade no trade, jump ball ."
you could grab damian lillard
"You're taking it too literal. That's not what he saying. Those players are not even close.  What really makes is Giannis better than Nikola Jokic or James Harden or Damian Lillard or whoever? What separates him?  You could say defense, but what about about some people who don't value individual defense as highly as you or I do?  What if offense and shooting threes and getting assists is more important?"
Damian Lillard
Nets receive: Damian Lillard  Blazers receive : Kyrie Irving and Landry Shamet/Bruce Brown  Dame can guarantee himself a championship IMO if this is done
Man what a trade off for the Trail Blazers. You guys can only have a hobbled Damian Lillard while the poor Lakers are without Rondo! That’s actually fair now that you point it out.
The funny thing is we acknowledge Paul George is a better number 2 option than number 1. I’m ready for us to have that conversation about Damian Lillard
"Am I confused about what you’re saying here, or do you think that Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard are on the same team????"
"Luka had the [highest USG% in the league this season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::usg_pct) and Booker was 7th - higher than Giannis, LeBron, and Damian Lillard.  Either one would be off the team by now, or at least one wouldn't be making the money that they currently are."
Damian Lillard forces his way to the Lakers.
Damian Lillard dribbling the ball off his foot at the end of a game leading to a turnover with like 2 seconds left in the game.
"Offense:   Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Carmelo Anthony, Jusuf Nurkic  Defense:   Norman Powell, Derrick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Jusuf Nurkic."
"""Damian Lillard for AD: Who says yes?"""
“Giannis is who Damian Lillard *thinks* he is” - Amin Elhaussen probably
"Ray Allen did it without Curry next to him. Ray Allen also revolutionized the spot up shooter game and is #1 currently. Teams didn't shoot as many 3s in that era also. Curry is #1 because like he blew up the NBA, Can shoot from anywhere on the court off the dribble, redefined gravity in basketball basically. With 3 pointers it's not going to be possible to compare numbers fairly very quickly. There isn't really a real answer because KD, Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, Damian Lillard, Dirk, and Pistol Pete all played in different eras and if you left them open they were knocking the shot down from 3, but like not all of those guys shot 6-8+ 3s per game, shit Pistol Pete was famous for shooting past the 3 point line well before the 3 point line, in college. Like to say that this person hit more 3s in a season in less attempts and say that's the reason that he's better than Ray Allen who started his career 25 years before Klay Thompson won his first championship leaves out the era, the defense faced, the role in the offense, who he was playing next to, the system itself."
"&gt;Damian Lillard has never shot above 40% from the field in a series beyond round 1.  Stupid, cherry-picked criteria."
"They're solidly behind (with regards to the All-Star game, voted on by fans and then coaches) Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard. They're more in the Donovan Mitchell, Paul George range, which means (with regards to making the Western Conference All-Star Team) they're borderline/fringe."
"Damian ""Ben Simmons"" Lillard"
"you really think the trail blazers will take wiggins wiseman and picks for damian lillard, when the sixers and knicks have much better offers and you don't even need another guard? 😂😂😂"
"Lol there’s a difference between threes generated in the flow of the offence (e.g in transition, from help defenders helping off) and an actual, elite pull-up threat. Paul is a good three-point shooter but everyone knows that his preferred move is to snake the pick-and-roll to get to the elbow. Booker is not a good three point shooter and is far more comfortable in the mid-range as well. A guy like Damian Lillard or Steph Curry in Booker’s place would completely change how the Bucks have to defend."
"Steph Curry, Damian Lillard"
"Booker still needs to Mature  Booker plays a role, star volume shooter. For example Damian Lillard and Kobe Bryant also have this role. When you play this role, it comes with responsibility, on one hand you’re a fantastic scorer who has freak of nature scoring ability, but on the other hand you need to know when it’s not your time. For example tonight booker shot great % wise, but was not playing winning basketball. He took ISO’s and chucked up shots when that was obviously not the best play. And wether you like it or not he played a bit role in the loss today. You can’t do everything yourself and as Paul George said “that’s a bad shot” while he may sound salty considering the situation he’s right. While it’s amazing when it goes in it’s tiring when it doesn’t, his teammates shot well today and also want to win a ring, yes he is the superstar but they show up to practice too, they grind too. Part of maturing in basketball is realizing that it’s a team game no matter how great of a player you are, you can’t do everything yourself. Booker is still young and I think he will realize this and win a least 1 ring, but for now he has a hard pill to swallow, he’s no longer on a trash franchise it’s time to look at the bigger picture."

"Call me a homer but I would rather keep a young Jamal Murray than an over 30 Damian Lillard, especially when Jamal's had more impressive showings in the post season."
"""Promises"". Like the promise of the player not going to strip clubs while his team is in training camp? That kind of promise?  You think teams aren't trying to put a contending team around? There are 30 other teams fighting for players and only 1 winner each season. So if a team can't put together a super team the team broke its promise to the player?  Harden wanted cp3 out of there and to get his friend westbrook.   Come on man. Portland has Damian Lillard eating 40M a year and his CJ eating another 30M. What more can portland add?  Players need to stop welching. Or give teams the right to void the contract completely (if player wants) and sign a new max player, that would be fair."
"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-10814/  Right under the ""Upcoming Contract Extension"" section it clearly states that the 2024-2025 season is a player option.   How hard is it to google the terms of the contract?  From the original article by Windhorst  [Blazers, Lillard agree to $196M deal, sources say](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27090640/blazers-lillard-agree-196m-deal-sources-say)  &gt; The Portland Trail Blazers and Damian Lillard have agreed to a four-year, $196 million super maximum contract extension, sources confirmed to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.  &gt;The All-NBA guard will have a player option for $54.3 million in the last year of the extension, sources said."
"Depends on how big a star you are. Definitely Steph, Lebron, KD are more well known than the biggest NFL stars. Established NBA superstars are more well known than an equally comparable NFL star. For example, more people know who Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony are compared to Aaron Donald and Julio Jones.

U'd need Damian Lillard and then also a Jimmy Butler or Chris Paul or someone on that level.

"This made me want to look up the leaders in possessions doubled/game:  Top 5 for the regular season:  1: Trae Young - 26.9; 43.9% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss   2: Luka Doncic - 26.9; 45.1% of possessions; 1.21 team pts/poss  3: Damian Lillard - 23.8; 40.3% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss  4: Chris Paul - 22.9; 42.8% of possessions; 1.19 team pts/poss  5: Bradley Beal - 22.4; 47.1% of possessions; 1.13 team pts/poss  -------------  Side note: It's hilarious how many of these stats I look up and see Trae and Luka 1 and 2 in some order. I know Luka's better and everything, but it's still absurd to have 2 players that aren't only this good but are this good at so many of the same things and defended in similar ways that were drafted the same year and traded for each other."
"straw man: an **intentionally misrepresented proposition** that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.  I do believe I'm using it correctly, because I am contending that no one expects players to be loyal to owners, but rather to teams and fan bases, and so by framing your point as expecting players to be loyal to billionaire employers, you're misrepresenting what people actually mean by player loyalty. You said that players ""don't owe anything to a billionaire who happened to win a lottery for the rights to the player’s labor for the first half of their career"", when peoples' push for player loyalty has never been about loyalty to their employer, but rather the fan base without whom their $200 million contract could not and would not exist.   I agree, that for players, that distinction becomes less meaningful because being loyal to a fan base necessarily means staying under the control of the team's owner, which is why I said as much in my original response. If Dame wants to go, he should be able to go. I'll never criticize a player for wanting to be traded to another team on the grounds of ""he signed a contract"" when we never hold teams to that same standard when they trade players without so much as having the decency to tell them before alerting the media. But for a lot of fans, what makes the NBA special is the coherence of the team. They want to root for a team, not have team jerseys just be the uniform players happened to pull out of the bin before a pick-up game. And it's fans' consumption of the product that allows Damian Lillard to have career earnings approaching a quarter of a billion dollars in salary alone. I fully agree that more of that anger needs to be directed towards owners who get more than half of the revenue derived entirely from the labor of their players and yet who continue to exercise functionally absolute control over when and where those players play. But star players consistently move on from small markets to go to LA/NY, and teams like the Thunder, Grizzlies, and Raptors have all but abandoned any prospect of signing even an All-Star caliber free agent. That's a real problem and a valid frustration for fans of small markets that quite frankly isn't on owners."
"As a Laker fan, my biggest fucking pet peeve is listening to our fanbase come up with these outlandish scenarios every offseason where we somehow land a Damian Lillard or a Luka Doncic-type player. Like, guys, it’s not that fucking simple for the love of god. Some of you guys are the most entitled, densest pricks ever, I swear…"
"Remember when he said he would rather not win it if it doesn't happen in Portland? He also said he would not ring chase. I think he's staying, dame is true to his word. https://www.blazersedge.com/2017/5/4/15550258/damian-lillard-stay-with-portland-trail-blazers-nba-championship"
"I agree. It is interesting, but you also need to consider the fact that Dame gave it all in many instances, he carried the team to the West Finals and the management did shit to secure decent roster depth. For one Damian Lillard I think it's worth going all in with trade options, but hey, they played it safe... look what's happening. Cheers"
"Nobody in Portland is blaming Dame. He's already stayed longer and been more loyal that anyone could expect. Also:   &gt; [""Right now I'm not sure what I'm going to do. **What I can say is my intentions and my heart has always been set on being in a Trail Blazers uniform for my entire career**,"" Lillard said after Team USA practice Friday at UNLV. ""But I think over time, you want to win it all. And **I want to win it all in a Trail Blazers uniform. But we all have to be making strides toward that.**""](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31829274/portland-trail-blazers-star-damian-lillard-denies-making-trade-request-hopes-big-changes)  So don't act like he's shitting on the city."
Mr. Lillard makes a good point.  But can management trade Damian to make the  Blazers a championship team?
"Need that, “Damian Lillard has signed with Klutch Sports and agent Rich Paul.”  tweet. That’s the only way."
"We absolutely should knock him for this. It's not as if he's on the last year of his deal, he has 3 more and a player option left. He isn't immune from criticism because he's Damian Lillard."
"As if no one else would offer Damian Lillard a max contract?  So is it about money or is it about the ship?  Hes already gotten 200M in his career solely from NBA earnings.  Yeah its a business, I get that.  But people are so willing so give NBA players a pass solely because theres Billionaires on the other side.  Its dumb.  Lillard made a shortsighted decision and it should bite him in the ass but the media is simping for him because they love the drama and want him to go to their favorite team."
You’re going to have to clarify for me how Damian Lillard forcing a trade out of Portland is going to benefit an ABA player who can’t afford healthcare because he racked up a bunch of injuries being underpaid while he was a pro athlete.
Literally Damian Lillard on every possession
Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Bradley Beal  Damian Lillard
"I would argue that the long term deal is part of the compensation for joining the team (or staying with the team), but isn't necessarily an indication of how long you're going to stay with the team. If we could turn injuries off in real life, this wouldn't be necessary. But Damian Lillard isn't going to risk money by signing for how long he expects to stay. Some of that is insured, but the potential of a lower contract next time is there for some stars. Teams are paying with financial stability and I suspect every NBA front office knows not to expect the star will stay there the whole time when they sign the contract.  Would people prefer for star players to have Opt Out clauses, every single one of them, and be able to leave in free agency for nothing? All for some false semblance of fairness?"
There was a time he said he would not go ring chasing and would rather not win it if he couldn't do it in Portland. My how the turn tables  https://www.blazersedge.com/2017/5/4/15550258/damian-lillard-stay-with-portland-trail-blazers-nba-championship
"You really think they wouldn’t trade Klay for Damian Lillard? You think that’s laughable? C’mon don’t be ridiculous.  We get Wiseman, Ben Simmons, the 7th, 14th and future picks. You think that’s a mediocre rebuild? How do you envision the rebuild going once Dame leaves? He’s about to request a trade, guarantee you can’t name a better haul.I guarantee you don’t respond with a better trade."

"&gt; I thought i heard dumb stuff but ""Damian Lillard and James Harden don't get trapped on PnR's"" is the dumbest i've heard hands down  It's hilarious because D'Antoni literally said the reason they stopped bringing Clint up for PnR's so often before he got traded is because it was basically just bringing up the second guy and allowing them to trap James with that guy."

Damian Lillard had the best scenes in my opinion
"Dear Portland   I was here for a long time, but not a good time.    Your bridges are substandard.    Traffic is awful because Portland isn’t built for 700,000 people.    Y’all have that cool Neon sign though.    It’ll always be the Rose Garden.    Kind regards,   Damian “Dollar” Lillard"
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe? Different era.  &gt; Joe Johnson  [One of the first high profile cases on small market teams having to pay non-deserving max contracts to land meh talent](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/414272-atlanta-hawks-ink-joe-johnson-to-119-million-over-six-year-deal)  Literally goes against the argument you are trying to make.  &gt; Steve Nash (prime)  Sure fine  &gt; Tim Duncan  Drafted on a team and won a ring in his second season.  The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.  Next.  &gt; Yao Ming  lol he agreed to a 4 year max after not playing for a year with foot surgery.  Chinese national I don't think playing for NY is exactly a priority anyways  &gt; Dwight Howard  I mean.. i guess  &gt; Kevin Garnett  I mean he left Minnesota (small market) team for Boston (big market) team so idk..  &gt; Kevin Durant 1.0 free agency (picked Dubs over NYC/LA, who had space and wanted him)  This is the absolute dumbest thing I have ever read.  The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
Jimmy Butler and Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard has his eyes on the Los Angeles Lakers per me. Source: just trust me
"A player like Dame is free to sign shorter contracts if he wants to move around the league at will, like other stars are doing lately.  He literally **JUST** signed a contract extension to 2025.  The team wasn't a contender when he signed it and isn't one now he knew it and everyone else.  I don't give a F about the owners.  Honestly, nobody does.  Nobody is going ""ohh woww think of the owners!""  Damian can't control what the team says and does but he can control what he says and does [like saying he wants to retire in Portland only to demand leaving a few months later](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2934703-damian-lillard-on-retiring-with-blazers-i-just-dont-want-to-go-elsewhere) or like [publicly scrutinizing Paul George for ""running"" to the Clippers away from leading his own team](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/damian-lillard-accuses-paul-george-of-running-from-the-grind-in-war-of-words-after-blazers-loss-to-clippers/) or like [saying he would never assemble a superteam to win a championship](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/heres-reason-damian-lillard-says-he-would-never-join-super-team)  He publicly supported Kidd or Chauncey being hired. He then claims he had no part in the hiring.  Yea, sureeeeeeeeee.    Anyways I ain't even a Blazers fan but...  From the fan perspective: A) having a team build around their star and him leaving sucks because they've spent all of their assets building around him when he's signed to a long term contract only to have him suddenly leave and B) Lame for your superstar to say he's never leaving only to suddenly leave.  Nobody cares how it impacts owners."

"&gt; Players (employees) should do what’s best for them. They don’t owe anything to a billionaire who happened to win a lottery for the rights to the player’s labor for the first half of their career.  Then they should sign with the teams they want to sign with in free agency.  They should accept the qualifying offer that was written into the CBA that the players agreed to that would give them a provision to do precisely that.  This really isn't complicated.   &gt; Employees don’t have a moral obligation to play out their contract with the drafting billionaire just because the billionaires demanded the contract rules give them an advantage to force the employee to work where he doesn’t want to work so as to preserve the owner’s tax write off.  Implying that there is any connection between esoteric IRS depreciation rules and the supermax is flat out one of the dumbest things that anyone has ever written in this subreddit.  edit: I wrote this before reading your argument that the SF VC ecosystem as a draw for players is comparable to Coca-Cola being in Atlanta or oil companies in Texas, incredible.  &gt; The owners are frauds and they set the players against the fans to prevent the simple right of being able to choose where you want to work while maximizing your income.  Pro-labor NBA takes get more atrocious every year.  It's not about 'billionaires', it's about 100M+ net worth superstar athletes negotiating contracts in bad faith, demanding to get traded for pennies on the dollar (frequently trying to tank their value on the way out) and ruining the fan experience of entire cities for the better part of whole decades by doing so (while simultaneously ignoring the fact that a broadly competitive league is in fact a prerequisite for interest in the league, and thereby contracts, to continue growing).   One of the biggest things you miss in your whole screed above is that it's not about superstar players vs billionaires or fans, it's about superstar players versus non-superstar players.  Collective bargaining has resulted in the CBA being much more favorable and oriented in the interests of, say, Luke Kennard, than Damian Lillard.  Mobility for the top 10 superstars in the league -- many of whom don't even want to go anywhere -- is not something that the NBPA uses their negotiating capital on.  If you're mad about this a much more natural place to start would be on rank-and-file NBPA members."

Joel Embiid and Damian Lillard has a nice ring to it
&gt; An NBA source has told The Oregonian/OregonLive that Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard has no plans to request a trade.  I guess you're not a Lakers fan until you use a bunch of clown emojis like a 10 year old and have the most naive optimism
"What are you talking about?  The pool play is basically a round robin tourney.  Their pool has France (a few NBA players headlined by Gobert but after that, not much), Czech Republic that got in by the skin of their teeth against Canada missing Shai and Murray, and Iran.  If they have that day, it has to be absolutely apocalyptic.  In reference to the FIBA WC team, you cannot seriously compare a Derrick White to Damian Lillard or a Joe Harris to Kevin Durant.  For the rest of the world, they're still massively behind.  Sure they lost to Nigeria and Australia but they're more than likely will adjust and be better."
"Damian Lillard is 31 years old in an era where primes are longer and later into guy's careers than ever in NBA history. You act like Jaylen is a lock to be better than Dame, a lock to stay here for his next contract, and that Tatum's a lock to be here as well. Well, if you want to keep one or both of those guys around, you better get some fucking help. Because the rest of this team is dogshit. Dame is better than Brown now -- and you know what? he'll probably be better than him 4 years, too.  And Marcus Smart fucking sucks. Most overrated player on the Celtics for like 10 years."
"How about Warriors offer a package deal of (Wiseman, Wiggins, Oubre) or (Klay, Oubre, Mulder) + 2 first round picks for Damian Lillard?"
"And yet, a source is telling our local ""The Oregonian"" newspaper [this is not true](https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2021/07/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-has-no-plans-to-request-trade-source.html?outputType=amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true)"

"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
Trae Young is not better than Damian Lillard
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
"No, I just think he's overrated. He constantly underperformed come playoff time. When the pressure was at it's highest he crumbled repeatedly. His team was the favourite in multiple series that he embarrassingly lost in his years with minnesota. Even his Celtics team should of won more than 1 title and he often talks as if they did. Damian Lillard has already done far more in the playoffs than Garnett did before his single Celtics title, so has Demar Derozan. So has Paul George. So have a bunch of others. It ain't just about LeBron I was just using him as an example because Garnett and Pierce have both made their media careers by shitting on LeBron."
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
Exactly. Damian Lillard is a great floor raiser but is a bad ceiling raiser since he is such a ball dominant player. Top 10 in usage rate this past season suggests he can’t thrive without the ball in his hands and that’s when he’s best.
Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal are better at basketball than 99.99% of all players in NBA history. Their combination of elite scoring at all levels and very good ball handling/playmaking would have made them dominant in any era. And casual fans in 20 years might not even know their names.
"It's crazy that since then Ray Allen's record has been surpassed by Duncan Robinson, Damian Lillard (2x), Buddy Hield (3x), Klay Thompson and James Harden (2x). And then there's Steph, who's done it 6 times."

Damian Lillard isn't a top 15 player
- A lot of people will be saying that Philly made a mistake trading Simmons because they will end up noticeably worse in this year’s regular season unless they can get Damian Lillard.  - The Nets Big 3 will end up winning no more than 1 title.  - Miami will not win a single playoff series despite their offseason additions.  - The Celtics will underperform and fall to the Play-Ins.  - Utah will trade away one of Bogdanovic or Ingles for pennies in the hopes of avoiding the tax.  - Kristaps Porzingis’ will have a career year but that’ll go to waste by virtue of the Mavericks falling to the Play-Ins.  - The West will only have 5 teams above .500.

"I believe the Warriors are already contenders but it seems like the majority of this sub thinks that even if they added Damian Lillard, they still wouldn't be contenders"
"Dame is overrated af, he is a great player but all he ever will be is a discount Steph Curry. They had decent players but Dame doesn't make people around him better. Dame has hit big shots in big moments which is the reason he has all the hype but nobody cares about dame. Damian Lillard is a great number 2 and maybe the best number 3 if a trade is available. Dame is similar to Westbrook in the sense where people give both of them a pass that they never won anything but are great players and blame their costars."
"I always loved that when Max Kellerman says Damian Lillard is better than Steph Curry when it actually counts he conveniently forgets this whole series, where the Blazers I believe blew double-digit leads in all four games"
That's just not true. Look at your top 3 scorers that series.  |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MPG|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|CJ McCollum|.519|.423|.769|38.9|25.3|2.0|3.5|1.3|0.3| |2|Damian Lillard|.352|.300|.882|40.6|18.5|4.5|4.8|1.3|0.0| |3|Al-Farouq Aminu|.519|.433|1.000|32.7|17.3|9.0|1.3|1.0|0.5|  CJ and Aminu both shoot 50 from the field and 40+ from 3. Dame's taking almost as many shots as CJ and shooting 35/30.
Basketball is a team sport and his team had far less talent and skill than the opponents. It’s also a game of runs and when you go up early you should never expect to hold on to a lead no matter how large. It’s almost like you have a bias towards Damian Lillard because your question is very self explanatory if you watch any level of Basketball.
Julius Randle  Damian Lillard almost every year  Russell Westbrook
"Ball movement?  No jacked shots?  Defense?  Chauncey Billups has declared war on Damian Lillard. Lillard's entire game is coasting on D, pounding the ball on offense and jacking threes, or else falling down and waiting for the ref to blow the whistle.  How many practices under Billups will it take before Lillard requests a trade?  One at most, I'd say."
&gt;His defense most likely won't be close to what it was  &gt;Won't be anywhere near quick enough to play great d on guards anymore  &gt;Warriors would not be a contender if they added Damian Lillard  Can't wait for the season

A shitty NBA team vs a team with nothing but perennial all stars.  It was because G league vs NBA all stars and some say the gap enormous but team USA still ended up losing.  Ike Nwamu on the same court as Damian Lillard?  What?  He still manage to match him in points.  People don’t understand that basketball is a game of runs and anything can happen.

"I’m sorry dude but that’s just plain wrong.   ""Clutch time"" is defined as the last five minutes of a game in which the point differential is five or fewer.

Gotta remember that Charlotte isn’t gonna magically attract Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard. Might as well spend the $ on someone who wants to be there rather than save the $ for hypothetical players like NYK and BOS.
"By any measure he's an all-time great shooter. There are only 8 guys who've made more career threes on better efficiency (he's at 1930 threes made at 37.3% 3P%).  Their names are:  * Ray Allen * Steph Curry * Reggie Miller * Kyle Korver * Jason Terry * Damian Lillard * Dirk Nowitzki * JJ Reddick  (KD and Klay are likely to pass him soon, but no one else in the next few years)"
I will nominate Damian Lillard

Depends on the position. Damian Lillard is way better than Enes Kanter
"&gt; “Simmons feels thrown under the bus”  Saying “Simmons was thrown under the bus” is a narrative this sub has perpetuated based off of cherry picked sound bites. Go back and watch Doc and Embiid’s Post game comments. The whole post game comments. I guarantee you’ll have a different opinion on whether Simmons was thrown under the bus” or not.   &gt; “and has made his desire to leave public”  He has not. If you characterize the situation as Simmons  “made his desire to leave public” you must also think that Damian Lillard “has made his desire to leave public”. Neither of them have done so, but if we’re just going to say whatever we want, why stop there?"

"I think a 3 way with Blazers and Kings is a realistic move.  Philly gets Dame, Sac get Simmons &amp; Blazers get rebuilding assets (picks and young players).  I think the two biggest questions are:  1) who adds assets in a Simmons for Lillard trade? Lillard is the better player but is also 31 while Simmons is 25. How much are you really adding to Simmons to get a couple more years of Lillard’s prime? Maxey or Thybulle? Late 1sts? Personally I think I might do Maxey but Thybulle is off limits as he defense is too valuable with Simmons departure.  2) what young players would Sacramento be willing to put in a trade for Simmons? Would/should Sac do Fox? Personally I love Fox and wouldn’t but there is an appeal to keeping Mitchell and Haliburton (both on rookie deals for next 3-4 years). Gives a lot of options for building the roster out before they need extensions. The Hield fit becomes better with better defenders around him aswell. Ideally Hield + Bagley + Picks + Swaps would be the move but how many?  Phi gets Lillard  Sac gets Simmons + DJJ  Portland gets Maxey + Hield + Bagley + Woodard + Damian Jones + Sac 22 1st (unprotected) + Sac 23 pick swap (top 4 protected) + Sac 24 1st (top 4 protected) + Sac 24 pick swap (top 4 protected) + 25 pick swap (top 4 protected) + $13m cap saving/trade exception"

"Damian Lillard, the only ‘time’ it is, is time to exit in the first round."
"Damian Lillard.   Gets labeled the clutchest player in the league, but underperforms every single playoffs for entire series and his team gets eliminated because of it, no to mention he's lost against plenty of injured teams. ie. 2016 Warriors without Curry for 3 games, 2017 KD out 2 games 2018 Boogie out for the series, had homecourt advantage and got swept 2019 KD out for the series 2021 Nuggets' starting backcourt out for the series"
"What i can think of right now...(this is just my opinion)  Overrated: Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe (I don't know why Clippers traded for him), Doc Rivers (I know it's about players but still...),  Underrated: CJ McCollum, TJ McConnell, Nikola Vucevic"
"Kyrie's handles &amp; footwork are insane, that is true.  His playmaking is more for himself or the basic reads for a teammate, Damian Lillard is absolutely a better playmaker than Kyrie (I will get heat for this but IDC) and both of them are a tier below the best playmakers in the league and yet Kyrie gets lumped into that group routinely.  Definitely not a top 15 player, not even close."
"he gets paid like a leader and thinks of himself like one, though.  And if you dropped the 2016 versions of Damian Lillard, CP3, James Harden, Russ, Kyle Lowry or even someone like current Jamal Murray onto the Cavs they could totally win the championship.  LeBron makes it so much easier for his teammates, all of those guys who have struggled to find tremendous success as first options would be able to shine their brightest next to LeBron."

"Reminds me of when George Karl starting randomly shitting on Lillard and calling him a bad leader. Stotts basically told him to fuck off and called him out for what he was doing to settle scores;  &gt;""I owe a lot to George. I got my start in coaching with George. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him. He's a successful coach. That being said, if he wants to diminish his chances for the Hall of Fame, if he wants to undermine his chances of being a head coach again in this league, if he wants to settle old scores with GMs or players or whoever else, that's his prerogative.  &gt;But when it comes to my team and my players, he needs to stay in his own lane. He doesn't know Damian Lillard, he doesn't know how coachable he is, he doesn't know what a great teammate he is, he doesn't know how much Damian cares about winning, and how important he is to this franchise. And I thought his comments, however well-intended they may have been, which I don't understand, I can't tolerate."""
"Damian Lillard wants to attend a fight in Atlanta and so asks the NBA to have a Blazers-Hawks game around the same time.   Being as big of a fan as Damian Lillard is of boxing, it’s understandable that he wants to view some of his favorite athletes within the sport, face off in person. This hasn’t been possible due to the ongoing pandemic but ESPN Ringside released information regarding a fight between Jamal Herring and Shakur Stevenson that will take place on October 23rd of this month. "

Harden's strength is ironically his weakness. He's only dominant because he played on the Rockets and was given free reign to play his game. Which is a shady foul drawing game. Other than that he's a good point guard/shooting guard. Take away the foul drawing and given free reign of a team and he's no different than any other good point/shooting guard in the NBA. Put Damian Lillard or Zach Lavine or Jamal Murray in his position and they'll put up just as impressive if not mbetter numbers.   See 2021 playoffs.

"&gt;Westbrook and Dame have done more with less than Harden in their careers  Holy shit, wtf are you talking about? Russel Westbrook as a first option has NEVER made it out of the first round. Damian Lillard has not done anything in his career to be compared to Harden, he underperforms a lot in the playoffs.   Harden and Luka are pretty much the same players except Harden is better.  More with less? James Harden took the KD Warriors to 7 games, Dame lost in 4 to them without KD."
"Jimmy said several times that he wanted to stay in Philly. I'm saying that keeping Butler and Embiid together was a championship duo and I excluded Simmons on purpose in that scenario. Ben's value was much higher in 2019 because people were more willing to say that the fit for him isn't ideal but after many mental gymnastics and Embiid literally playing 30-40% of his possessions on the perimeter albeit being a generational low and highpost talent it's hard to find more excuses for Ben's supbar playoff performances once he faces an elite team.   Trading Ben would have gotten a massive haul back then, he was thought of as a franchise player, a lite version of LeBron with league-best defensive potential. And ftr I've said that Simmons and Embiid are a very questionable fit in 2018 already but the player Ben could be lead to the Sixers franchise and fans holding onto him for too long. Simmons is a very good, even great player. But he's nowhere close to being Embiid and Embiid benefits from a halfcourt creator like Jimmy much more than a transition and low-post creator like Simmons. His defense and ""theoretical vision"" (because Ben's vision rarely manifests because he's no scoring threat and can't initiate plays and create due to this) were too much of an exciting prospect but a lot of fans from other franchises saw the writing on the wall back then but were seen as haters, dumb or people that didn't watch Philly.   To conclude to something different I still think Philly will get a good haul for Simmons and I also believe the trade for Damian has a good chance of happening. Philly has been one of the best drafting teams so despite bad trades and roster composition they can offer a great young core to build around and if push comes to shove they can still add Tobias Harris to the package as well and then Damian Lillard will definitely be a sixer. After missing out on Harden for no real reason Damian Lillard is a good consolation price. If things had gone a bit differently under Elton Brand the Sixers could maybe have assembled an Embiid/Butler/Lillard core in 2022 or Embiid Harden Butler, surefire championship teams with potential to repeat and stay competitive over a 3-5 year window. I felt keeping Ben because he aligns nicely with Embiids age was a big mistake because Embiid's timeline is moreso a veteran timeline due to his demanding playstyle and health concerns. Pairing him with 30 year old prime Superstars was always the play imo."

Obviously it's a better option for top-tier players but college is still the best for under-the-radar players. You're not going to kill college basketball because the Morant Damian Lillard CJ McCollum always slip through. The G league ignite is not going to take 100 of the top 150 recruit.
revised  PG: Damian Lillard - 36$  SG: Jamal Murray - 7$  SF: Khris Middleton - 30$  PF: Bobby Portis - 3$  C: Embiid - 38$  BENCH  Tristan Thompson - 2$  Andre Iguodala - 2$  Kent Bazemore - 2$  this team is not losing
"**1. The Pacers are a franchise without direction, who would be better off selling their desirable assets right now (Brogdon, Sabonis, Turner) rather than meandering as they have been. While they have made “attempts”, first round picks are not their priority and it will be the death of their hopes for more than a first round exit. 2.	The Hawks are not a championship team, and will not be with Trae Young. To me he seems to be this era’s answer to Allen Iverson, but as with both their defense and dominance of the ball will ensure that they do not make that next step toward true contention. That being said, I respect everything they’ve accomplished this past year, and I respect Trae as a player. 3.	The Celtics are going to regret not finding a proper point guard, as after watching Marcus Smart I doubt he will be consistent enough on offense to keep them relevant. They’re going to end up winning about 44 games and losing in the first round. 4.	The Trail Blazers are going to trade Damian Lillard for a fringe all star, two first round picks, and two high level role players.**"
"If you define elite player as someone who can win a chamoionship as the number 1 guy.  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  Paul George  Are not and never will never be elite players. The love this sub has for Kyrie is asinine in my opinion. He's flashy. He doesn't know how to win. His winning percentage in games where he doesn't have another all star is under .500 I believe. That's awful, especially considering he's played his entire career in the East.  He actually has a 48% career winning percentage without LeBron and a 72% with LeBron. And that 48% includes all the games he's played with KD and Harden. LOLOL if you remove those games he is likely pretty close to 44%, and that includes his time with a really deep and talented Celtics team that had a better winning percentage when he was injured."
"1. LeBron‘s championship window is closed.  2. Harden, Luka, and Trae will be completely fine with the new rule changes, but Embiid and Butler will have worse seasons than they did in 2021 as a result of them.  3. Jayson Tatum is not a fringe top-10 player. He’s not clearly ahead of any of Booker, Beal, Trae, and Mitchell. Those 5 are close to interchangeable. His defensive edge is not great enough to clear him from the other 4, who are significantly better playmakers.  4. The Blazers organization has failed to surround Damian Lillard with sufficient talent, but he should also be held accountable for their postseason woes. He is one of the worst defenders in the NBA, and his playmaking is a significant notch below that of other elite point guards (Steph, Luka, Harden, Trae, CP3). He can be an excellent second option, but can’t be the centerpiece of a championship team.  5. Julius Randle’s 2021 season was an anomaly, and it will have been his peak.  6. Michael Porter Jr. is not a max-extension worthy player yet. He is a lights-out shooter, but his IQ lapses and inability to become an elite defender (injury limitations) will be a problem for him and the Nuggets in the future.  7. Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson are the two most overrated players in NBA history.  8. Kevin Garnett at his peak was better than Tim Duncan at his peak.  9. Stephen Curry is the best offensive player ever.  10. The Suns will win the 2022 NBA Championship."

"1. Damian Lillard is not good enough to be the #1 option , he should’ve been like Kyrie. Perfect number 2.  2.James Harden is better than D-Wade on pure skill while wade has the accolades.  3. Luka is a top 5 player and better than AD.  4. Nets won’t win the finals as last as Deandre Jordan is on the team , finessing 10m and a quality roster spot.(yes we know the reason he is there is cuz he is friends with Kd)  5.

"ESPN ""after stating he wouldn't miss games/forfeit pay. Damian Lillard has also now stated he gambles on free agency"""
Dwyane Wade is the greatest person to ever touch a basketball.  Luka Doncic is the most overrated player in the league. And will never win a championship as the number 1 guy.   Ayton is never going to be a top 5 center in the league.   Shaq is all time better than Kobe.   Damian Lillard isn’t a good playoff player.  Giannis is a better player than KD.
The triple double that lost us Damian Lillard
I changed it to Portland Trail Blazers: Damian Lillard (2012-13). ARE YOU F**KIN' HAPPY?!
The Blazers have had 9 years of Damian Lillard and one of the richest owners in the league and have nothing to show for it.
"Is your best player Ben Simmons or Damian Lillard? Good for the former, bad for the latter"
Did you not also see the two 1sts and the two swaps? Not too mention Maxey and another pick from Philly (I'm guessing)  And then the headlines will read *FIVE firsts* (because they always include swaps) *and players* (even if they are trash) *for Damian Lillard*

"Not a good playmaker. Dude you dumb as rocks, DLo is not only a good playmaker, he's a great (but not elite) playmaker. He's a comparable or better playmaker than Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De'Aaron Fox, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, and Brandon Ingram. Some of these guys benefit from having a more aggressive scoring game and being the clear focal point of their team (Dame, Ja, Fox), and some of these guys numbers are depressed because of the team and system within which they play (according to my eye: Donovan Mitchell for sure, maybe BI)."
"&gt; Damian Lillard denied a recent report Friday that he was expected to demand a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. ""It's not true,"" Lillard said, while adding that he expects to be in a Blazers uniform next season. However, he did couch those comments by saying that he hasn't made a firm decision regarding his future.  If he 100% wanted to be in Portland he would shoot it down hard."
"I think the drop off from talented defensive wing to Damian Lillard, undersized guard with immense defensive deficiency could very well tank everything around him."
"Unless Damian Lillard is a huge Tony Snell fan, none of those acquisitions moved the needle in the slightest.  Those are end of the bench guys you just mentioned.  Lillard himself said this team wasn’t just a coaching change away from a title contender and Tony Snell certainly isn’t changing that lol"
"13: Curry :  Curry has never won with his athleticism. Even at age 33, he’ll still be the best shooter in the world and one of the NBA’s most electric players with the ball in his hands. I don’t see any way how Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, or even Russell Westbrook is going to pass him up over the next four years."
"The creators of that list did a [""4-years-later"" podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-25-best-players-in-the-nba-in-2025/id1513185617?i=1000501914533) in December 2020 where they discuss the old list and make a new one for 2025.  Spoiler warning: the 2025 list is in the description of the pod. It's also posted below:  &gt;! Here's our list for posterity's sake, along with their ages as of Jan. 1, 2025.!&lt;  1. &gt;!Luka Doncic (25)!&lt; 2. &gt;!Trae Young (26)!&lt; 3. &gt;!Giannis Antetokounmpo (30)!&lt; 4. &gt;!Anthony Davis (31)!&lt; 5. &gt;!Zion Williamson (24)!&lt; 6. &gt;!Jayson Tatum (26)!&lt; 7. &gt;!Jamal Murray (27)!&lt; 8. &gt;!Nikola Jokic (29)!&lt; 9. &gt;!LeBron James (40)!&lt; 10. &gt;!Kawhi Leonard (33)!&lt; 11. &gt;!Cade Cunningham (23)!&lt; 12. &gt;!James Wiseman (23)!&lt; 13. &gt;!Karl-Anthony Towns (29)!&lt; 14. &gt;!Devin Booker (28)!&lt; 15. &gt;!Kevin Durant (36)!&lt; 16. &gt;!Joel Embiid (30)!&lt; 17. &gt;!Ben Simmons (28)!&lt; 18. &gt;!Stephen Curry (36)!&lt; 19. &gt;!Bam Adebayo (27)!&lt; 20. &gt;!Jimmy Butler (35)!&lt; 21. &gt;!Michael Porter Jr. (26)!&lt; 22. &gt;!Donovan Mitchell (28)!&lt; 23. &gt;!Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (26)!&lt; 24. &gt;!Damian Lillard (34)!&lt; 25. &gt;!Jaren Jackson Jr. (25) !&lt;"
"Surprised to see Portland not being a big loser. They again do nothing significant and poor Damian Lillard will have to do it all again before being bounced early in the playoffs.  Their biggest move has been signing Powell, a solid but unspectacular player who Toronto didn’t want to invest in."
In this hypothetical Damian Lillard asked for a trade because his front office did nothing to improve the team so I really don't think the blazers will be laughing at all
"[""I woke up to those reports,"" Lillard said after a practice session with Team USA in Las Vegas. ""You know a lot of people reaching out to me. But it's not true. I'll start off the rip and say it's not true. I said the last time I spoke to you guys that a lot of things are being said and it hasn't come from me. Number one, it's not true. And secondly I'll also say that I haven't made any firm decision on what my future will be. So there's really no need for anybody else to speak for me or report this or report that."" ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/damian-lillard-says-trade-request-rumors-not-true-expects-to-be-in-a-trail-blazers-uniform-next-season/)  I just listen to Lillard and what he says. You guys are the ones who try to act like he's sending smoke signals or some shit. Lillard is one of the most blunt players in the league, if he wants to be traded, he'll just request a trade."
Ok well I’ll try to make it as simple as possible.  The assets you get in return for Simmons + your own top 5 pick &gt;&gt;&gt; your own top 5 pick and no other assets at all  &gt;you’re adding an extra step to a process that doesn’t need to be there  It actually 100% *does* need to be there since the idea of getting literally *nothing* in return for Damian Lillard is utterly ridiculous and something no front office would ever dream of considering.
"Dame said he can live without winning a ring, but he changed his mind in the last year   https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-wants-ring-would-rather-be-champion-life"
He was co-mvp that year with some guy named Damian Lillard. Hmm whatever happened to him I wonder.
"Damian Lillard.   Lillard is 31 and while he has been a terrific individual player for years, he could sure use some Finals hardware to elevate his legacy beyond being just another very talented guard who never got to the promised land."
A Rare Picture of Damian Lillard. https://www.instagram.com/p/CUN4MNmpaJe/?utm_medium=copy_link
"Sounds like the prospects for a Damian Lillard class trade just got flushed down the toilet. He's going to end up between a ""trade him for anybody"" or ""just get rid of him."" What prospective team would want him knowing that if he pulled this shit on Philly, he could do the same to us. His playing days might be over/"
"Doc: ""This Ben Simmons is a real piece of Human Garbage. Every breath he takes is a breath that could be better used by Murderers and Rapists. If I had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with Ben Simmons, Adolf Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden I would Shoot Ben Simmons Twice. I look forward to the day I can take a shit on Ben Simmons grave. Anyone who ever loved Ben Simmons was wrong.  Ben Simmons is so ugly, that when he was born the Dr. Slapped his mother. Ben Simmons' Mama so fat the bitch gets through life sideways....  ...so, Ben for Damian Lillard seems fair, right?"""
Damian Lillard wins MVP
- Celtics and Blazers both finish Top 4 in their conference  - Damian Lillard wins MVP  - Neither of the Nets/Lakers make it past the 2nd round again  - Victor Oladipo balls out in the playoffs   - Miami Heat win the championship
Damian Lillard
"I think a lot has to do with his natural shooting motion. He minimizes how much he bends his knees, relatively low release point (closer to Devon Booker and Damian Lillard height), and it's VERY one-motion. Plus probably a lot of in-game playing experience where people are always hugging him so he naturally has to make the most of the short time frame he gets.  Idk Curry is a friggin monster"
Damian Lillard (Vriska)
Damian Lillard to demand trade from Portland.
"At first I thought you meant dame was a former mvp,the most recent runner up for mvp and an nba champion,and I was like damn what is this guy smoking lol.Also funny how you mention these guys biggest accolades and then theres just Damian Lillard"
Yet Doncic isn't even the leading scorer during his own playoff career.  He's third behind Durant (34.3) and Mitchell (33.9).  |Rk|Player|From|To|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2021|2021|34.3|.630| |2|Donovan Mitchell|2020|2021|33.9|.640| |3|Luka Doncic|2020|2021|33.5|.582| |4|Damian Lillard|2020|2021|30.3|.646| |5|Ja Morant|2021|2021|30.2|.578|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/23/2021.
"I’ve watched literally every Luka playoff game so far and he’s been phenomenal. But these guys need to let him earn his stripes a bit more before we start ranking him above guys like Harden, embiid, AD or even Dame (a former mvp, the most recent runner up for mvp, an nba champion, and Damian Lillard, respectively)  this early in his career.   I wouldn’t be surprised at all if Luka tops this list sooner rather than later, but he should get it because of his actual accomplishments in the nba."
Damian Lillard arguably played even better this year. Donovan Mitchel put up 36 points with 60% TS in his 1 and done playoff season as well. We shouldn't judge everything from 1 playoff series.
Has to be in the conversation for most stacked Top 10 during any year of basketball.   Damian Lillard just had back to back years of &gt; 62% TS and &gt; 30% Usage and he doesn't even crack the 10 best players in the league.
"What a moron. I bet you think Robert Horry is better than Damian Lillard too huh, since Dame can't win and Big Shot Rob has 7 rings."
 Blazers gonna have Larry Nance as the 2nd scoring option after Damian Lillard with a trade like this
"Simmons has averaged 14.5 wins produced per season, but the last two seasons were abbreviated for Covid so an estimate of 16.5 wins per year is better.  Simmons has had a similar first four years to Chris Paul and John Stockton, but Magic was better.  Steph Curry, Jason Kidd and Lillard's first four years weren't even close to Simmons.  Nash had a bad first four:  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/3131-ben-simmons](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/3131-ben-simmons)  https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/2136-magic-johnson  https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/211-chris-paul  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1100-john-stockton](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1100-john-stockton)  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/92-stephen-curry](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/92-stephen-curry)  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1309-damian-lillard](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1309-damian-lillard)  https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/60-jason-kidd  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/269-steve-nash](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/269-steve-nash)"
"Well the blazers got the 6th pick from the nets. So however well the blazers play with healthy oden and roy, it wouldnt have affected that pick, only their #11. That #6 turned out to be damian lillard."
The way you phrased it makes it sound like you’d take Joel over Dame because of health? I hope you mean the opposite because Damian Lillard has played in virtually all of his games in his career - one of the most durable players in the league
"&gt;None of the stuff I mentioned are things you can't do as a PG.  You *can* do them, but they're much more typically the role of a frontcourt player, which Ben is much more suited for. His biggest flaw is his shooting, which becomes a smaller problem if he's slid over to the 4 spot next to a playmaking, floor spacing point guard like Damian Lillard."

"Greg and brandon’s careers were robbed by injuries. Assuming the blazers still get the same picks they wouldve had this lineup in 2015:  Prime Brandon Roy, prime Greg Oden, young Damian Lillard, peak Nic Batum, prime Lamarcus Aldridge, young Wes Matthews, young c.j. Mccollum.   We were absolutely robbed of an actually comptetitve Warriors-Blazers rivalry."
"I think, in Dame's case, it has to be a three-team deal to really work:   **76ers gets:** Damian Lillard  **Timberwolves get:** Ben Simmons   **Trail Blazers get:** Their desired combination of McDaniels/Reid/Thybulle/Maxey/Springer/Reed, and a bounty of picks."
Ben and 2 first round pick for Damian Lillard
I mean sure. But there’s also a good chance his value depreciates by then and you have to include more of your other assets for said star. And at best it’s still gonna be a middling star.   For example you have no real shot at getting a Bradley Beal or a Damian Lillard. If those teams trade them they’ll want rebuilding packages and there are plenty of teams that could outbid Philly fairly easily.  In a best case scenerio it’s like a CJ McCollum or a Gordon Hayward
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Didn't the year before 2013 they trade for Gerald Wallace and gave their 1st round pick which ended up being Damian lillard?
This also says Luka and Embiid &gt; Curry and Damian Lillard &gt; Kevin Durant   It's like it's made to make everyone on this sub happy
"No, they woudn't. On average, they would be a lot better. But there would also be a lot of shit games thrown into there.   Hell, Damian Lillard was playing against some teams that are arguably below top NCAA teams in the Olympics... and he kinda sucked."
"&gt; PER looks like a great stat  It isn't.  It's good when comparing all-time greats to other all-time greats, but does nothing when comparing good to great players.   Mitchell Robinson has a 21.6 career PER. Damian Lillard has a 22.4 career PER. Damian Lillard is not 3% better than Mitchell Robinson."
"It’s always hilarious how people claim that the league today isn’t immensely more talented than it ever was when guys like Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Damian Lillard are lower top ten."
Brent Barry. Damian Lillard. Your trivia fact was almost a fact.
"I want the Damian Lillard experience. I mean, can you imagine? Getting to hang out with CJ Elleby *every day*?"
Damian Lillard is an Amazing PG. He averaged 34 PPG and 10 APG in the playoffs last year. Why did Jrue Holiday start at PG for the Olympic team over Lillard? Is it because defense equals wins?
damian lillard confirmed to be in portland in 2024.

Damian Lillard for Damian Lillard.......tough one
Damian Lillard for Damian Lillard
"Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Cade Cunningham, off the top of my head.     In other sports- Novak Djokovic, Alex Morgan.  You're about 5 years behind on the current exercise science."
"Trail Blazers? Damian Lillard for Clyde Drexler is a tough call, honestly."
"The Blazers are a team without a clear cut best, so you can make arguments for several players.    Everyone has different criteria for best- Walton had that brilliant but short peak where he took the Blazers to a championship and won an MVP, it’s our only title and only MVP player we’ve had, but as mentioned he was quickly injured and departed so he wasn’t a Blazer for long.    Drexler has a lot of the career accolades, he put in the time and took us to competitive highs, however his teams never got things to break their way just right and so he didn’t get to bring a trophy to the city.  He’s also like Walton eschewed the franchise and it’s fans, instead he reps Houston, which can leave a sour taste in the mouth when discussing franchise best.    Brandon Roy or Damian Lillard are in comparison fan favorites, they’ve had extremely memorable playoff moments, and embraced the franchise much more, but unfortunately Roy was cut down by injury before we got to see his peak, and Lillard is now on the other side of 30 and tiring of the team’s inability to successfully go far in the postseason, rightly or wrongly he is beginning to eye the door for greener pastures with a better chance of a ring."

"Blazers, Damian Lillard is currently the best player and also the franchise best player"
Damian Lillard or Dame Lillard. Hard decision.
"&gt;Nah I disagree with that take. Everyone in the NBA can make a three.    I wasn't talking about simply making an open three. I was talking about a highlight of in game action where a player is making difficult threes.    Like, [this highlight](https://youtu.be/QI58Zf6FY0I). Making off the dribble, off balance, step back threes. Setting a 3pt record... but he's not Damian Lillard and using this clip to make that argument would ve dumb.   &gt; Not everyone can stop Lebron, Kawhi, and Zion 1-on-1 even one time.   I think that you'd be surprised by the number of average defenders who have had good defensive possessions against those guys. Let alone above average defenders like Gordon.   Average defenders have a lot of good defensive possessions. Great defenders just have more. The same way that average shooters make a lot of shots. Great shooters just make more."
"&gt;He's not responsible to be anything other than himself on the court.   &gt;   &gt;If that's not a player they want, they shouldn't have made that known.  I don't see it this way at all, if they didn't want him, he would be gone. This is a business, and guys get traded all the time, saying every trade rumor means you don't want your guy is the wrong interpretation, it just means you want the other guy more. The Sixers can both want Simmons on the team and simultaneously be cool with trading him for a better player.  The Sixers are expecting him to play, they want him on the team.  Simmons on the other hand has [made it known](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-ben-simmons-wants-out-wont-report-to-camp-damian-lillard/) that he does not want to be a part of the team, that's where this is all coming from.  You won't find an article saying the Sixers don't want him on the team, because there isn't one, they've said the exact opposite."
"Watch 60 point game Watch 37 point quarter Watch game 6 vs thunder If Klay is a role player, Damian Lillard is a borderline all-star.  Hasn't played in 2 years might not be the same. But he was a star if not more before"
"I think of Mario as short. Damian Lillard is Mario. Short, thick, handsome face, and ready to take on an empire all by himself, one jump at a time.  Paul George is more Luigi, but there are probably better Luigis at the center position."
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
"- We will depend heavily on a three guard rotation. Norm is a longboi so that helps, but he'll still get taken advantage of by many, many SFs.  - Our offense is too reliant on Damian Lillard. This makes us easy to prep for come playoff time.  - To get all our guards enough minutes we're foregoing (again) having a real second unit point guard.   - Nurkic is injury prone. He's our second best player, but he's only been fully healthy in like one playoff run."
Zach LaVine or Damian Lillard
"1. Paul George - For the Clippers make the six-seed (per the Westbrook precedent), which they definitely could do, he would need to average great numbers and lead an otherwise below-average team (unless Kawhi returns earlier than expected). He's definitely capable of this and this would secure him votes.  2. Damian Lillard - A lot of his case borrows from PG's, but Dame has an arguably better team so he'd need to be a bit better. He needs to be more consistent but that's very much in the realm of possibility. The west is stacked this season but he's the only solo All-Star on all the Western conference teams widely considered locks for the playoffs. If he gets the four-seed he's a guaranteed MVP finalist and is bound to get votes as long as he makes the playoffs.  3. Ben Simmons - No this isn't a joke. This is however assuming Ban gets traded to Cleveland. Whether Cleveland trades Love, Garland, Sexton, or Okoro, they would make up the difference with Ben and then some. Playing in a smaller market will help him develop the confidence he needs to become the superstar he has the talent to be and should this happen he will become an MVP candidate. Cleveland's roster has the capability to be in the playoffs, and if Ben leads them to that he's an MVP."
My bet would be Damian Lillard in a Dame D.O.L.L.A. video - that would be lit 🔥
Damian Lillard should be an obvious choice here. Maybe things finally click in Portland with a full season of Powell and the addition of Larry Nance.
Damian Lillard
"I mean, that's the narrative that's been thrown around after the high-profile LeBron, Harden, KD, etc. moves  But once you look past those few examples, you have Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Giannis, Gobert, Embiid, Marcus Smart, KAT, all guys who have been on their teams for quite a long time and/or have signed long contract extensions that will likely keep them at the same team for several years.  That's just off the top of my head. Tim Duncan and Kobe only retired what, 5 seasons ago? And Nowitzki in 2019.  Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat's roster.  And the NBA has been incredibly cold and cutthroat at times in other eras.  Jerry Krause cut Phil Jackson loose from the Bulls after he won 6 championships. The Bulls also locked Scottie Pippen into an incredibly low-value contract and refused to renegotiate when the salary rules changed the year after his contract was signed.  And players forcing trades happened in other eras too: Dominique Wilkins refused to play in Utah and forced a trade.  Stephon Marbury demanded a trade out of Minnesota when he didn't get along with KG. Kareem demanded a trade to L.A. because he thought Milwaukee was too small of a stage for him.  Ultimately I don't actually think the NBA is fundamentally very different for the vast majority of players.  There have always been top players who used their leverage over teams, and there have always been teams who didn't look out for their players unless it was convenient.  The main difference now is that it's all happening on social media and everyone's *constantly* talking about it."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"No, he actually swept Damian Lillard and the Blazers then went on to steal a game in a series against arguably the greatest NBA team ever assembled.     Embiid has never made it out of the second round with a much better supporting cast and in a weaker conference. AD is a better all-around player and a top 2 defensive anchor in the league when healthy. Joel just doesn’t contribute to winning in the same way"
"Klay Thompson, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae young, and more are ALL &gt; Westbrook"
Damian Lillard and Chris Paul are better players than Nash Kidd or Stockton ever were.
Paul George &gt; Damian Lillard
Harden isn't a choker by any stretch in the clutch but he's not that takeover killer in the final minutes like a Damian Lillard or Kyrie Irving and I'm not saying that to shit on James.
"Allen Iverson   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Chris Paul   Damian Lillard   Dennis Rodman   Dirk Nowitzki   Dominique Wilkins   Dwayne Wade   Dwight Howard   Gary Payton   Giannis Antetokounmpo   James Harden   Jason Kidd   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Kevin Garnett   Klay Thompson   Kobe Bryant   Kyrie Irving   LeBron James   Manu Ginobili   Pau Gasol   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Reggie Miller   Russell Westbrook   Stephen Curry   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Tony Parker   Tracy McGrady   Vince Carter"
"Since then, of guys that have since started and ended their careers, you can add Kobe, Duncan, KG, Dirk, Nash, Kidd, Wade, maybe Ray Allen?   And then guys who are still active: Lebron, KD, Steph, Giannis, Kawhi, CP3, Harden, Dwight, Melo  Of guys who weren’t on the Initial list, or who I didn’t mention… Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Paul Pierce, Pau Gasol, Chris Bosh, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis all have shots.   I think guys like AD, Dame and George will be hard to evaluate because they’re in the middle of their primes and not absolutely historic, but they each have multiple all NBAs, all defense, prolific scoring etc"
Lillard a chance to send the Thunder home. Lillard long range three AND ITS GOOD. AT THE BUZZER DAMIAN LILLARD ARE YOU KIDDING ME”
Damian Lillard. He is one of the best PG's ever.
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"How’s he one dimensional when he does everything at an elite level except defend..? That’s like calling Steph Curry or Damian lillard one dimensional.   And bens not bad but he has severe holes in his game that significantly hinder his own abilities and his teams aspirations. And he doesn’t excel at anything except 1v1 defence, which is the least impactful form of defence"
"That’s seems a bit unfair. It’s not like the kings are a bottom feeder like the cavs. They’ve generally finished fairly close to the play-in and were the 9 seed a few years back.  Ben has him beat in defence but playmaking id probably go fox. Ben is a great passer but he’s no scoring threat and doesn’t space the floor at all which are both large parts of playmaking. Fox does those and is an extremely good passer in his own right. And assist wise he has way less assist opportunities via team mates than Ben does.   And the scoring gap is substantial. Very close efficiency but fox has a way deeper bag and averaged a whole ten extra points? That’s comparable to the gap between MPJ and Damian Lillard, or Andrew wiggins and Bradley Beal"
"If you’re just going off of long distance Field goal efficiency, then by that argument Damian Lillard (37.5%) and James Harden (36.3%) would be near the bottom of this particular list right next to Bird (37.6%). I think volume also has to be taken into account here.   For example Dirk is 38% for his career but almost has 10x as many total 3 point field goals made (1982) as Drazen Petrovic (44%) and almost 2.5x as many as Chris Mullen."
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5). Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  6). Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  7). Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  8). James Harden, Brooklyn Nets  9). Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  10). Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  11). Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat  12). Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  13). Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns  14). Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns  15). Paul George, LA Clippers  16). Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets  17). Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  18). Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz  19). Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards  20t).

agreed. we'll see what he looks like next to damian lillard
"Just a few you guys might be curious to see:  Paul George: 36/108(33.3%)  Damian Lillard: 20/61(32.8%)  The worst I've seen are Tracy MacGrady, who was around half(it's hard to tell because of his late career couple minute appearances, but it seems to be around 49-52%) and Allen Iverson(42/71, or 59%)  Among active players the worst is Russell Westbrook(52/111 = 46.8%)"
"They do, but at the same time the media won't allow a player averaging 50/25/2 to not win MVP. By and large, there isn't really an MVP in the last 15 years that you can say the media got it completely wrong, there's debates here and there (2005 and 2011 come to mind), but that's to be expected when hundreds of people are voting.  Players aren't reliable for this, what are the odds that James Harden watches Luka Doncic night in and night out? Or that Joel Embiid watches Damian Lillard often. They have scouting reports, but these guys have more to do than watch the Mavs play the Kings in a random Wednesday night."
"""Damian Lillard entered the chat"""
Michael Jordan and Damian Lillard are the only NBA players to have ended two playoff series with buzzer-beaters.
"Ah yes, the years when he managed a mind-blowing 22 points on 20 shots and orchestrating his entire offense to the tune of 2 assists per game, and doing it with **NO** help other than Brandon Roy and Damian Lillard and Nic Batum (when he was good) and Wes Matthews (a premiere 3 and D guy preinjury).  Meanwhile, Bosh managed a measly ...24 points?  On 16 shots, with more assists...wait, hold on.  Alridge was more efficient though because...never mind, Bosh also shot MORE free throws?  Oh, but that's because he had *way* more help, he played had a ton of elite teammates, here, let me list them:  Bargnani, Calderon."

"not sure why i'm downvoted and why you repeated the buzzword ""two-way wing"" and thought you said something  damian lillard don't play no defense and he can carry a team"
"""We tried to trade you for Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum and Stephen Curry, but couldn't find a deal :(. Friends again?"""
I love Damian Lillard. He'll always be one of my favorite players.
"You are not getting Damian Lillard in a Simmons trade. Even before Ben said he doesn’t intend to play for the Sixers, which effectively has taken away any bargaining power the Sixers had. You aren’t getting a player that calibre for a non top 20 player.   I doubt Joel and FO wants to waste too much time with this debacle. The window is already limited by Joels health."
"Can someone explain Damian Lillard to me? How come he hasn’t forced a trade yet? He is 31 - he is about to enter the last phase of his prime.   He tries to push the FO to make moves to compete, then when they don’t he doesn’t indicate that he wants to skip town.   Either the man truly doesn’t care about a ring or he is delusional and believes the Blazers have a chance?"
"&gt;None of those players listed were available to Portland.  Is Portland just suddenly excluded from the NBA when trade talks for star level players happen? Lol    &gt;They all selected where they wanted to re-sign and play.   They all didn’t decide where they wanted to get traded though. Putting my jabs at Portland aside they’re still a good team, but would be a great team with another All-NBA level player. Outside of Kawhi and his determination to get to LA all of those guys just wanted to be in winning situations and if you got them next to dame not only would Portland be a real contender but I’d trust Lillard to be able to convince anyone he got on that team to stay there.    &gt;People thought Milwaukee should blow it up and then they won a championship.   I don’t recall that at all, the main contingent of people wanting them to blow it up were Heat, Knicks, Lakers and Maverick fans thinking they could get Giannis in free agency. The difference with Mke and you guys is the fact that Giannis is about 5 years younger than Lillard so their window is/was much larger, and they’re a team that made those moves and risks to get them in the spot they are now with that trade for Jrue who could’ve been a UFA before he signed an extension.  &gt;They beat the ""star studded"" Brooklyn Nets.   Very very situational win lmao   &gt;Did anyone seriously think the Suns were going to be the 2nd best team in the west and make it to the NBA finals by adding an old ass Chris Paul?   Just like the bucks finals run it was very situational with the Suns playing 3 teams all with an injured star. We’ve seen Portland get blessed into a situation just like this when they made the WCF in 2019 against an injured warriors team and they still folded, and realistically that was your window and only real chance to the finals.   &gt;You're a fucking liar if you say you did.  Calm down buddy   &gt;What about the Jazz? Did anyone have them being the #1 team in the NBA during the regular season? How many superstars are on that team? lol.  #1 seed and regular season awards don’t mean anything for a team with Damian Lillard who is eager to even sniff a championship.   &gt;I have no idea why folks on reddit feel so damn confident projecting wins/losses.  Because we’ve seen what these Trailblazer teams have done the past damn near 8 years. You’re not a championship contender, your team didn’t get better in comparison to the rest of the west/league, you don’t have some young player with crazy potential that will vault you into that conversation and you realistically don’t have an avenue to get there. You can take off the rose tinted glasses."

"While they are certainly controversial opinions, because the players have large, fanatical fanbases, I am always debating the following points:  1. Lebron James's ascension to 'Goatdom' or near 'Goatdom' was pre-ordained and undeserved. Preordained because it was clear that the media, the NBA, and all the companies he endorsed were on the same page with his hype, and all he had to do was get close enough and their spin and omissions would fill in what he could not. While he is certainly one of the most unique and talented players of all-time, that alone does not make you a GOAT, or a top five player. i personally cannot put a player in my top five who hand picked his All-Star teammates on multiple teams, and his ring total is still lower than individuals who did not. People say he played teams that were 'unbeatable', but that TOO is nonsense. That Houston squad who pushed the Warriors to the brink of elimination, won more games against GS, WITH KD, in one series, than Lebron won against them in back to back Finals. On top of that, despite how great the Warriors were in the NBA Finals, Steph and Klay - with the exception of the last Finals for Klay - were never as productive and or efficient as they were in the regular season. If you look at the production of the top four players on the Warriors and Cavs in 2017, Lebron averaged a 30+ pt triple-double and KD averaged something like 35. Kyrie averaged more points, and was more efficient from the field and three point range than Steph. Klay and Kevin Love both averaged 16pts, and Draymond and JR both averaged something like 11. So, how exactly was the Warrior's collection of all-stars unbeatable? What happened was, the limitations of Lebron as an on-ball player was exposed, once again. His style of play is very predictable and teams simply adjust. No, what the media and Lebron fans do is diminish the quality of his teammates or opponents, based on the result that Lebron achieved. For instance, if Lebron loses, it's because he had 'no help', or his team was the 'GREATEST TEAM OF ALL-TIME', even though a team like Houston had them against the ropes, all because they got physical with them. Beyond that, I could never put a perimeter player in my top 5 all-time, who is a sub-40 percent shooter outside of the paint for the career, and such a poor FT shooter. Nope. Can't do it.   2. Stephen Curry is overrated. If the lack of Final's MVPs weren't enough, it is abundantly clear that Steph Curry's ascension coincided with the NBA's efforts to increase scoring, and style of play. You make the game less and less physical and make three-point shooting the primary weapon, and give Steph a teammate who is almost as great of a shooter as he is - then the results are obvious. However, deeper into the playoffs, where the best defensive teams are, and the refs allowing more physical play, you will have a two-time MVP with Final's MVPs. He is the same as Harden and Westbrook in the sense that, they all explode during the regular season, but come down considerably during the playoffs Of course, Steph comes down less than they do, which explains his trips to the Finals - but it is the same concept.   3. Damian Lillard is even more overrated than Steph. I could write a mini-novel on this point as well, but I am far less passionate about Damon Lilla, as Barkley calls him.   4. KD is highly skilled, but would certainly be less effective in a more physical era. Once again, the Houston Rockets had him and GS against the ropes, ALL BECAUSE THEY GOT PHYSICAL WITH THEM. I remember Colin Cowherd, who always praised GS for their unselfish, highly skilled style of play, saying that the Warriors were probably the greatest team of their era, but struggling so much against a team who is only playing physical defense, proves that their status has been bolstered by a deliberate softening of the league. Not unlike Brady playing and excelling at such an advanced age due to the league becoming hyper-protective of QBs."
"James Harden was always roasted for playing poor defense but I think Steph Curry and Damian Lillard were not far off from Harden’s defensive ability or inability.   Just my opinion, I’m not hating on anyone."
Noted low post scorer Damian Lillard.
"Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Damian Lillard. Everyone loves to overate flashy guards. I’ll say though that as soon as any of them get in a shooting slump, they very quickly become underrated. Small players are inconsistent at times. When they get hot, everyone hops on their D and says they are the next steph. A couple bad shooting nights and they are overrated chuckers."
"Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Caris LeVert, Kawhi Leonard and Brook Lopez.  Edit: I didn’t read the post correct and they’re not in order"
"Look, if Damian Lillard came into a Plaid Pantry or a Pizzicato I was working at he is getting his shit for free from me."
"Guys like Damian Lillard don't contribute very much to the overall basketball story of the 2010s. If the HOF acceptance criteria was actually ""who do we need to tell the story of the NBA?"", he would be left out amongst countless others while guys like Derrick Rose and Jeremy Lin do get in.  Dame won't be left out in reality, and those others like him are already in or will be in the HOF, so we know your criteria for selection isn't accurate."
"It’s amazing how someone can be so condescending yet so completely stupid.   First of all, no, it’s objectively impossible to know. Those people who’s entire jobs it is to find NBA talent don’t know. They use the knowledge they have to evaluate who they project to be the best draft talents. It’s educated speculation on their part. If scouts or GMs knew who would be good, there wouldn’t be major draft steals, especially non-project players that contribute right away, like Damian Lillard or Donavan Mitchell. There would also be no draft busts. This point makes absolutely no sense.   And secondly, speculation is fun. I’m all for it, and I speculate on posts here all the time. The issue is, if you actually read the thread before trying to argue, the fact that the person I responded to said often when teams tank for the draft, they whiff on their picks, and that Houston didn’t whiff on their picks, so they had a great off season. Logically this makes 0 sense, since these picks could absolutely fail, the same way they did for the other teams that they pointed out. We don’t know yet, and we have no legit way of knowing until they play. Understand ?"
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"Right, but... the argument that Dame takes tougher shots than Steph doesn't hold up. At all.  Dame and Steph are quite comparable players in terms of playstyle. Steph gets double-teamed more, lately, and is more likely to get double-teamed in the back court close to the buzzer because everyone knows he can hit from 3/4 court if you leave him open.  We return to the question:  Are you genuinely trying to argue that Damian Lillard is a better shooter than Steph?"
"KD &amp; Jokic have some of the deepest bags in the league.  I would also include Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, Luka Doncic and CJ McCollum on there as well.  LeBron also has a pretty excellent bag of tricks but it feels like he has relied so much on being bigger, stronger &amp; faster than everyone to get to his spots it's not as flashy as some of the other guys on this list."

Gerald Wallace to the Nets for the pick that became Damian Lillard
"He’s never averaged 20 free-throws a night, and he’s literally coming off an injury. You think Damian Lillard is lost too? Because he’s averaging the same stats"

Damian Lillard
"Not the absolute worst, but the start of a long line of really poor trades and signings. The last time the Blazers had a bunch of young talent they…  Blazers traded:  - Will Barton and a first round pick that became Malik Beasley (&amp; Thomas Robinson, victor claver)  To Denver for: -Arron Afflalo (&amp; Alonzo gee), to replace injured Wesley Mathews.   Afflalo goes from shooting 50% mid range to 39% and injures his shoulder in 2 months. Leaves blazers a few months later in free agency to the knicks. Out of the league 3 years later.   Matthews after tearing his Achilles leaves blazers in free agency for dallas. Comes back from injury, goes on to be a 3 and D journeyman.   Comparable first round picks (#19 and lower) in 2016 included: - Malik Beasley (Por first round pick to Den) - Caris levert - pascal siakam - dejounte Murray - Malcolm brogdon  Will Barton (who was close with Damian Lillard) while suffering from off and on injuries, has gone on to sign multiple contracts with Denver, whether he has been in the starting lineup or coming off the bench he has averaged approx. 14/3/5 (fg 43%/3fg 36%) with just under a steal a game in his 8 seasons with Denver. While portland has struggled to find a consistent figure to lead a bench unit or fill the sf position."
I don't why I read it as Damian Lillard but I did and now I'm confused.
"1- New Jersey Nets acquired Gerald Wallace in exchange for Shawne Williams, Mehmet Okur and a top 3 protected 2012 pick.  Wallace was then traded in the KG/Pierce trade to Celtics of 2013. Okur and Williams never played a game for Portland. BUT that 2012 first round pick became Damian Lillard.  2- New Jersey Nets acquired Brandan Wright and Dan Gazduric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second round pick.  Troy Murphy was immediately bought out by the Warriors. Wright and Gazduric played a combined 30 games for the Nets before signing new contracts in the next off season. Warriors used that second round pick to select Draymond Green."
Nets traded the pick that became Damian Lillard for an old Gerald Wallace. Gotta love Billy King!
"How come nobody mentioned the fact that Gerald Wallace single-handedly saved the Blazers franchise? He ended up getting traded for a first-round pick to the Nets, and that pick turned out to be... Damian Lillard.  But shoutout to the human didgeridoo, the GOAT inbounds passer"
The fact that you even say James Harden’s name in relation to Damian Lillard proves my point.
Jimmer Fredette will win ROY.  Damian Lillard will be a bust (because he's clearly not as good as Jimmer).
Should have been Dwight instead.  Also Vince carter over Damian lillard
Speaking for the fans?  Why would you do that when it's Damian Lillard talking about it?  Just like PG13 did?
Damian Lillard is massively overrated and will not achieve much more as a first option. His inclusion over Dwight in the top 75 players was laughable. One could argue Klay and Draymond have had better careers and deserve a spot over him as well at this point in time.  Loyalty and a few buzzer beater highlights only go so far.
Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Damian Lillard?!
Thank you.  I’ll forward this over to Adam Silver and co. immediately. We’re removing Damian Lillard off that list.
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over?

Damian Lillard is far and away the most overrated player of the last decade.
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
Tatum is a better Basketball player than Damian Lillard.
"Damian Lillard. If the Portland rumors are true I'm 100% certain he wants to get traded but won't say it out loud.  He'll play great he's just Damian Lillard, he might not be excited to be in Portland rn."
"KG and Pierce were both top 10 in a bunch of advanced stats in 08, including winshares (and winshares/48) and VORP.   All three of them were in their very early 30s, and by all accounts still in their prime (albeit nearing the end of their prime.) KG was pretty widely accepted as a top 5/6 player and PP was seen as top 10. Ray Allen was hovering around 20th. Maybe not MVP contenders, but it would be like Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, and Bam or Beal joining up right now. IMO a superteam.   You're right though, not on the same level as the Heatles or especially Warriors"
Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Damian Lillard?
"The Ringer boutta drop a ""The Blazers have a Damian Lillard problem"" article"

"Damian Lillard checks out: 4/15 FG, 0/8 from three, 4 turnovers, 12 points  Combined he’s now 2/24 from three this season"
Is it time to be genuinely concerned about Damian Lillard?
"Damian Lillard has a difficult start to the season, but with a player of this level, we know very well that it only takes one thing for him to catch fire again and give us an impressive series.  Stephen Curry had known that at the beginning of last season. We know what happened next."
Cries in Damian Lillard.
It is time to be concerned about Damian Lillard
"i guess you're thinking of this  https://www.si.com/nba/trailblazers/news/report-damian-lillard-played-through-ab-injury-at-olympics  i haven't paid very close attention to blazers news, but he sat out 2/4 preseason games as well."
Is it time to be genuinely concerned about Damian Lillard?
"Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, the Love machine."
"Damian Lillard because I've lived in Portland for (much more than) the length of his career &amp; have greatly enjoyed watching his growth for the last decade.  Also Giannis because he's awesome (especially in person), extremely likable &amp; humble and he beat the freaking Nets in the playoffs last season so he's good in my book forever"
"I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Damian Lillard, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too."
Hmmm… [Heres Dame’s averages in all the games CJ missed last season](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=damian+lillard+01%2F18%2F21+to+03%2F14%2F21)
Damian Lillard
"I think they'd prefer Damian Lillard, but you have to look at what's available and fair."
"That just proves the point. He needed the best defenders in the league to win championships, which is what Damian would also need. Not saying he's as bad as Lillard."
"Realistically, no.   But, in theory, yes.  This line-up, if it was ever assembled, would win a ring IMO:   PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Norman Powell  SF: Khris Middleton  PF: Julius Randle  C: Bam Adebayo"
"We thought he would break out like 2 years ago after the Blazers tried to lose the final regular season game against the Kings on purpose but rookie Simons dropped like 40 and almost singlehandedly won the game by himself. It led us be matched against OKC instead of Utah in the first round, resulting in the infamous Damian Lillard 37 footer 3 bomb over Paul George."

"No stop it. PG13 is great but he not top 10 in scoring tho. My only problem is Damian Lillard making the list he never led the league in scoring, assists and three point percentage. Dwight should have been there instead of Dame."
Within the context of the person I replied to it is pretty similar as he saying that injuries dictated the results and I agreed which could be argued occurred in 2016 as well. Damian Lillard had a nagging injury 3/4 of the way last season which he played through and definitely altered his production as well as James Harden in the post season he was there but wasn’t himself
"Karl Anthony towns. Luka doncic in a couple of years. Damian Lillard. The whole Celtics roster rn. Jimmy butler and Joakim Noah by the bulls.  Best in the world type player, surrounded by average or injury prone stars.  Idk wtf is going on with the Celtics, they seem to be going lower and lower down the pecking order. Heat, Sixers and maybe the bulls will wash them in a couple of years."
I hope we win but no matter what I get to watch Damian Lillard play basketball tonight and that makes me happy.
Damian Lillard deserves better.
Damian Lillard. Don't know why but as a Curry fan I've always hated him.
"They are thinking all their picks and pick swaps for 7 years, all their crypto, Pat's and Gino's, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton, Paul Reed, and Tyrese Maxey for Damian Lillard and a Dutch Bros. Location.  Edit: Neil Olshey hangs up then calls Philadelphia Police to do a wellness check on Daryl Morey."
Damian Lillard is still building his case.

DAMIAN LILLARD DUDE
Present day: Damian Lillard and all the players New Orleans have attempted to build around.
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
&gt;Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard  Sr.
"While Portland has definitely played it too safe during Lillard's prime, I think we give him too much credit in this discussion and ignore that the best player on the teams that eliminated the Blazers was almost always better than Dame. He was probably let down the most against the depleted Nuggets but Jokic was still the reigning MVP cancelling out Lillard's epic performances with MVP statlines. Before that, they got eliminated reverse chronologically by LeBron, Steph, AD, Steph again, Steph once more, Marc Gasol, and Tim Duncan. Other than Grizzlies and arguably the Pelicans series, Dame was never beaten by someone who's a worse player than him. He even had Aldridge with him during the Grizzlies series where you could strongly argue that 3rd year Dame wasn't even the best player on his team. At some point, we're going have to accept that all-time top 15 players like LeBron, Duncan and Steph are usually gonna wreck teams led by Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard. The Blazers would've had to have been Spurs level team builders to get a team led by him past KD, Steph, LeBron, Harden, Kawhi, CP3 to a championship."
Damian Lillard is at the top of this mountain for the moment.
"Absolutely Dwight deserves more than Davis or, even worse, goddamn Damian Lillard. That list was a joke"
"I'm not saying Harden and KD have no chance, but you saw what happened in the playoffs either one of those guys goes down the Nets lose a significant portion of their overall team.   If you look at last years stats Brogdon had a similar if not better year than Jrue (both started 56 games with 32-35 mins), and again he is also younger than Jrue.   My whole point is, Simmons value is not gonna go higher than what it was after the playoffs, it's even lower now and every subsequent game he doesn't play this season. Getting a superstar is off the table if they don't want to unload a lot of good young players (plus draft picks) that are already built around Embiid.  But, it looks like Morey has already decided to play the long game so it's not like this even matters lol. And sorry if I'm not getting my point across more clearly (and the essay responses lmao), but I'm still enjoying the back and forth.  My basic argument is that the 76ers don't need a Damian Lillard or anyone on that level to be successful, as long as Embiid is healthy and there are good pieces around him they can win, he elevates the team that much."
If Damian Lillard is on that list than Klay Thompson for damn sure should be on that list
Is Damian Lillard better than Klay and/or achieved more?
Is Tony Parker a top 75 player? Probably  Is Tony Parker better than Damian Lillard? No
Damian Lillard every morning when he wakes up:  Ykno what we haven't talked about lately? Loyalty
"list have always been worthless, why did they even stop at 75?  if you aren't in contention for the GOAT then its all the same to me  like should we really be trying to rank Alex English and Damian Lillard, both are in that tier of great players"
Elite defender Carmelo Anthony and lockdown defender Damian Lillard
"it was just a comparison to point out your flawed argument. I dont see how what you mentioned is enough to be on a 75 all time players list, it feels like you just love the idea of Damian Lillard but cant realize he isnt nowhere close to most names in there. Look at  Nash, Dirk, Pierce, Iverson, etc they either won MVPs or were crucial pieces for championship teams, plus they overall career resume of course.  &amp;#x200B;  Now, you also have names like AD and of course, Dame, who yes are of course great nobody is telling you otherwise dude, but how are they exactly top 75 great? over Dwight? who was dominant, the best player at this position for like 6 years, plus 5 1st all nba teams in a row and 3 DPOY? u are going to compare that to Damian Lillard scoring an efficient 50 point game? thats my point"
Bro you’re comparing Dame to Steph that’s where you failed. Steph just had that mvp season at 33? Dude was mvp before. Look at all his rewards and titles compared to Dame. Huge difference. Damian Lillard just another dude like Paul George. Just a great player that has done completely nothing.
So why is Damian Lillard here?
Did you even read my posts because I’ve already mentioned this. He has 2 scoring titles which not many players have multiple its a short list. Then I already gave you an example of a player like Damian Lillard who has less all star-all nba teams and has never made it deep in playoffs either. I could keep going down the list but there are more players who’s stats and awards are less than his.
Dwight Howard should be on the list instead of Damian Lillard as well.
"My problem is Damian Lillard. What has he done to deserve a spot. Accomplished literally nothing (so far). He’s Just a scorer, yet Tmac and Vince didn’t make it. There are more accomplished point guards, Parker and Kyrie. There are better big men who actually won something (ring, dpoy, defensive team, etc.) Howard and Bosh. Yet Lillard who has done nothing made it?"
That’s why I prefaced it with I know he was injured a lot. Still even injured Tmac had 7 time all star/ all nba and 2 scoring titles. Then you have guys on the list like Damian Lillard with 6 all stars and rookie of the year. I’m sorry but Tmac should have 100 percent been on this list injuries or not.
Damian Lillard too. How is he Top 75?
"I mean the Pacers offered Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert, plus whatever picks and that’s a decent haul for a guy like Simmons. The pipe dream of getting Damian Lillard is just wishful thinking at this point."
https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/.amp/news/sixers-hope-dream-scenario-swapping-ben-simmons-damian-lillard  Literally 2 weeks ago…
"This should go without saying, but I am much too young to make proper judgement of these players.   Of the ones that were already included in the top 50 list, I’d say Billy Cunningham, Lenny Wilkens, Earl Monroe are fringe at best, and I feel like others are more deserving. Players like Sam Jones, Pete Maravich, Dave DeBusschere are fringe as well but not enough to warrant taking them off the list.   I understand they don’t want to remove anyone from lists, but I think Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis is premature at this point.  Super glad they added in Reggie Miller, Dominque Wilkins, and Dennis Rodman"
"That's how I feel about Damian Lillard. Hasn't done nearly enough in my opinion. What's he on there for, long range 3's? I'd put PG on there before him."

Then you want to discuss impact on the game which is highly hypothetical but Dame is an all-time great shooter, he is one of the best (maybe all-time best I can't find the stat) from 30ft. Dame has had historic moments as well. 3 60 point games, two game-winning buzzer beaters in the playoffs.  Klay has the championships sure, many could argue as the 3rd or 4th most important player of those teams depending on how you value Draymond but I'm not gonna knock Dame down for sticking with Portland, not lucking into having a generation talent grow next to him as Curry and another ring chasing one in Durant joining him.  Klay's a very good NBA player, not an all-time great. Not to be taken as Gods word but Basketball Reference's Hall of Fame Probability calculator has Dame at 91% and Klay is down at 50%.  All in all, Dame is a better player and more deserving based on individual success and talent."
"&gt; You see, you are right, it is a game of chicken. But, the defining thing about a game of chicken is that if neither party swerves, they both lose! Right now, Morey is playing a game of chicken with Ben Simmons and it's absolutely possible that they both lose.  It's certainly possible, but the Sixers have 4 years and Ben has however long he's willing to go without getting paid. Which is *probably* a lot less than 4 years.   Is it possible that they both lose? Yes. But right now, the Sixers have a lot to risk by swerving and very little risk by staying on course.   &gt;Also, it's not purely black and white. This is not the stock market. There's actually people involved. So let me ask you this. If I'm the type of player that the 6ers want in exchange for Simmons, and I just watched Morey drag an All Star player through the mud for trade value, why would I risk my career with you?  It's my impression that Ben is not receiving a lot of sympathy from *anyone* in the league, not just other players in the Sixers organization. In short, the general consensus is that he's taking the idea of ""player empowerment"" way too far.  And there's good reason for them to dislike this. We're not that far off the next CBA negotiation, and Ben might be doing some very real harm to the negotiation position of the Player's Association.  The owners have generally been quite willing to offer the players more and more control over the last few CBAs. There's pretty good chance to think that development is about to come to a screeching halt.  When billionaires negotiate with millionaires, the billionaires tend to win.   &gt;If I'm Damian Lillard, and I have a similar contract to Simmons, I play in Philly for a year and it doesn't quite work, am I going to trust you to look after me?  I don't know Dame very well, but I have a very hard time seeing that he would find it acceptable to put himself in the situation Ben is in. Everything I've seen from Dame is that he's a consummate professional and fully accepts taking accountability for himself.   &gt;Nobody fined James Harden when he didn't show up.   I'm not aware of Harden ever going AWOL? The only practices I remember him missing before getting traded is where he was isolated by COVID-19 protocols.   If the Rockets considered him to be AWOL, then they have no discretion in the matter. The CBA doesn't say that teams *can* fine players for an unwarranted absence, it says that the team *must* fine them.   &gt;The Spurs continued to pay Leonard even after he was medically cleared by the team staff, and even after he asked for a trade.  The Spurs actually had discussions with the league on this, again, because the CBA says that they *must* fine the player if they believe the absence to be unwarranted. There was medical disagreement on whether he was cleared to play. It wasn't just Kawhi saying *""nah, I'm hurt""*, he had medical support for that.   The Spurs didn't *want* to fine him, which is why they sought clarification from the league.   &gt;Nobody, until now has dragged a star player through the mud like this.  I think *very few* people feel like Ben Simmons is being dragged through the mud. There's a reason why absolutely no players, including other Klutch clients, or the Player's Association are standing up for him.  Ben has very much put himself on an island.   &gt;Just because something is in the contract doesn't mean it's in your best interest to enforce it.  So far, it clearly is, though."
"The player with the second most 8+ 3pm games is Damian Lillard... with 23.   Era makes a big difference. But he still has almost 3x the amount as the next guy.   In fact, if you add up the next 3 guys, you get 23+21+14=58 games."

"I agree, but since the list only added 25 new players and several of them were locks, unfortunately, some of our favorites won’t make it. I was hoping for at least one Gasol to make it.   I don’t think Lillard has done enough to warrant his selection over Dwight Howard. Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Yao Ming, Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis are at the same level to me: on the outside looking in."
"We’re really pulling out rookie of the year here?? 🤣 .. Dame played 4 years in college and you’re surprised he won it over a 1 and done 19 year old? Jesus.  And you’re not going to adjust for pace with Kareem and Kobe? This is all so cherry picked it’s laughable.  Dame has 6 all star selections, and 1 All NBA first team selection. That’s it.  AD has 8 all star selections, 1 all star game MVP, 4 NBA first team selections, 2 NBA all defensive first team selections, 3 blocking titles, and an NBA championship.  No, Damian Lillard is not even close to being one of the most decorated active players. That’s a fucking joke."
"If Damian Lillard accepted his spot at the end of the bench, he never would have been at the rec center before it opened.  If he listened to those who overlooked him, he never would have heard his name called as a first round pick.  If he let six all-star selections go to his head, he never would have had the heart to give back to the streets that shaped it.  That's the fighting spirit.  That's what makes a lion."
Damian Lillard was on the list but not Dwight D Howard?!!!
Didn’t you hear? They only want Damian Lillard😂
"Let's compare three players:  **Paul Pierce (19 seasons):**  * 1 championship  * 1 FMVP  * 4x All NBA (3x 3rd Team, 1x 2nd Team)  * 0x All Defense  * 1 top 10 MVP finish (7th)  * 10x All Star  **Dwight Howard (17 seasons):**  * 1 championship  * 3x DPOY  * 8x All NBA (5x 1st Team, 1x 2nd Team, 2x 3rd Team)  * 5x All Defense (4x 1st Team, 1x 2nd Team)  * 5 top 10 MVP finishes (2nd, 4th, 4th, 5th, 7th)  * 8x All Star  **Damian Lillard (9 seasons):**  * ROTY  * 6x All NBA (1x 1st Team, 4x 2nd Team, 1x 3rd Team)  * 0x All Defense  * 5 top 10 MVP finishes (4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 8th)  * 6x All Star  If you can only pick two of these three, who are picking?"
"Correct. Bob McAdoo and Dominique Wilkins.  3 guys made it in, but weren't on the original list and were mid career. Dennis Rodman, Reggie Miller and Gary Payton.  There were other guys in the league / rookies but obviously didn't have enough resume, since it was 1996/97. That gets Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.  Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce were another year or two away and Dwayne Wade was a few more years.  The rest of the new list is all active. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook.  No real issues maybe other than Davis and Lillard, how do they stack up against full career Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Vince Carter and especially nearly full career Dwight Howard who seems a glaring omission. Does Grant Hill get any leeway for what he should've become and proved he could be (although for not long enough)?  Anyone likely a lock for this in 25 years when they do 100 years? Doncic? Jokic? Embiid? T. Young? Tatum?"
"Damian Lillard has never played defense in his life, so idgaf."
its damian lillard man.
How did Damian Lillard make it over dwight Howard?!!
"Tf Damian Lillard do to be in this list. At least AD won a chip, even tho his career is not as great as some of those that are snubbed. Dwight&gt;AD career wise as of now"
"Denne sub elsker hober sig op på Lakers, men hvorfor er ingen taler om den forsvarende Western Conference Champion Suns er 1-3?   Jeg var ikke klar over indtil nu, at Suns er i øjeblikket 1-3.. Hvorfor er der ingen, der taler om det?   De tabte til en middelmådig Kings hold et par dage siden og næsten tabt med 30 pts til Trailblazers med en kæmper Damian Lillard. Og fra hvad jeg ved, de er næsten fuldt sund.   For alle, der aktivt ser Suns i denne sæson, hvad er hovedårsagen til den tidlige sæson kampe? Man skulle tro, de ville have en masse momentum til at starte sæsonen efter deres fantastiske Finals run…"
"A questo sub piace tantissimo impalarsi sui Lakers, ma perché nessuno parla del fatto che i Suns, il campione uscente della Conferenza Ovest, sono 1-3?  Non ho accorto finché ora che i Suns sono correntemente 1-3…perché nessuno parla di questo?  Sono stati sconfitti da una squadra mediocre: i Kings un paio di giorni fa e perso da quasi 30 punti ai Trailblazers che hanno un Damian Lillard in difficoltà. Da quanto so sono quasi completamente in buona salute.  Per chiunque guardando attivamente i Suns questa stagione, cos’è la ragione principale per le lotte nella prima parte della stagione? Si penserebbe che avrebbero un sacco di slancio per iniziare la stagione dopo il loro incredibile corso ai Finals…"

"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
Damian Lillard 2016-17. 27/5/6 on 59% TS
"How does Damian lillard go to the rec centre before it opened? Did he just stand at the door and wait around for someone to show up? If so, what’s the point. It’s closed. You’re just waiting."
"[https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/\_/id/7690823/new-jersey-nets-acquire-forward-gerald-wallace-portland-trail-blazers](https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7690823/new-jersey-nets-acquire-forward-gerald-wallace-portland-trail-blazers)  The New Jersey Nets acquired forward Gerald Wallace from the Portland Trail Blazers in a deadline deal on Thursday in exchange for center Mehmet Okur, small forward Shawne Williams and New Jersey's protected 2012 first-round pick, the Nets announced. The pick is top-3 protected, according to a league source.      A team source told ESPN.com's Chad Ford the Nets were willing to part with their top-3 protected pick because there are only three players in the upcoming draft the Nets covet -- Kentucky's Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Kansas' Thomas Robinson.   ...     That pick was Damian Lillard ..."
"That's a bit of an exaggeration. Blazers went 2-2 last year with CJ playing without Dame. They beat two teams they were supposed to and then lost to the Clippers w/PG no Kawhi by only 1.   The meme referencing the Suns ""and nearly lost by 30 pts to the Trailblazers with a struggling Damian Lillard"" - Dame shot 2 for 7 from 3 and CJ got 28 while going 6 for 11."
"Trading Damian Fucking Lillard for whatever the fuck Ben Simmons even is right now is completely laughable, and the fact that people seriously think it's a fair trade is absolutely wild to me."
"Well, if you watch the Portland Trailblazers you don't need to worry about not knowing whether or not you've seen great defense because they don't know how to play any or what it looks like either. I guess maybe they could make that a selling point. Relax and watch Damian Lillard. Basketball for dummies."
"People were legitimately saying Damian Lillard might be the best PG in the league last season, even after a couple of weeks after the season started. Can’t say I’m surprised at a 4 day old account Bron fan being salty at Steph tho lol"
Him beating both Donovan Mitchell and Damian Lillard is probably something that answers thr question if he can succeed in the post season better probably
"Dude, you must not have watched Jokic playing drop coverage against Damian fucking Lillard lol  That's not on the guard. That's just bad defense.  Go watch that 55 point game and you'll see multiple times where he's nearly in the paint while Dames man is being screened"
I genuinely think it's because of how they look. Damian Lillard looks like he's tougher/rougher/rugged than Steph (baby faced) and people associate that with defence.
"You clearly don't watch the games lol. Those players go off because our guards can't contain. For instance, when Gary Harris returned to the bubble to guard Donovan Mitchell, he suddenly stopped his supernova streak. When we put a good defensive guard on the other team's best guard we suddenly did great lol. Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, and Devin booker were all guarded by our 3rd stringers..."
"Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Devin Booker going nuts and having historically great playoff series attacking Jokic the past 2 playoffs is probably not a coincidence."
"He's also not top 2 in APG. He's 5th in PPG and 3rd in APG. You used totals purely to be misleading.  &gt; how often do players do that?  All the time? Luka was 5th and 5th in points and assists last year, for example. Jokic was 12th, 9th, and 6th in points, rebs, and assists.  The prior year Luka was 6th and 3rd in pts and assists. Damian Lillard was 3rd and 5th in the same categories.  Every year you have a top point guard end up near the top in both points and assists. In 2014, Russell Westbrook was 1st in points and 4th in assists. In 1972, Tiny Archibald led the league in both points and assists."
Everyone talks about Dwight Howard being a clear snub from the top 75. But Draymond Green also deserved to be there. Both guys deserved it clearly over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.
Warriors fans cheer every Warrior and also Damian Lillard
"Not really, he is one of the most loved players here, but I always thought his bad defense was overstated. People were talking like he’s Damian Lillard levels of bad on defense at one point because he’s not very athletic.  Some people here even think Larry Bird wont be as good today because he wont be able to guard anything because he’s unathletic. And that’s just not true, if anything he’d be better. He has great hands on defense and a very smart defensive IQ, his lack of lateral quickness wont matter at all."

"I don’t think you were listening to the broadcast. Fitz specifically said it to deride Dame. The statement was something like “People hype up Damian Lillard, but he’s nowhere near Steph Curry, he’s just a volume shooter”. The way it was said came off really badly."
Damian Lillard: 40/30/90  Donovan Mitchell: 42/31/87   Must be trash players too
should've been Dwight instead of Damian Lillard
I think the idea that a player being skilled means he should be refereed unfairly is bullshit. He's the only superstar not to get superstar calls - normally it goes the other way.  You're just pissy he's better than Damian Lillard at literally everything.
"Shai Alexander, Goran Dragic, Damian Lillard"
Damian Lillard has a winning percentage of 56% in 700 career games. Paul George has a winning percentage of 43% in 723 career games. How exactly is that a more winning style of basketball?

"U keep moving the goal post Lol. That Blazers team had a young Damian Lillard, who was an allstar that year and a prime LaMarcus Aldridge who was averaging 30 points and 2.5 blocks a game that series, and they had a good starting five overall"
"Dwight Howard and Tony Parker should have both been on that list over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. The one was the face of a franchise (Dwight for Magic) and was legitimately a top-5 MVP player during his peak years, while the other (TP) was a 6-time all-star, 4-time champion, and a finals MVP -- not to mention that TP is among the leaders in playoff points in the paint, **as a point guard.**   Anthony Davis has only won one 'chip and has not even been the FMVP of that series and Damian Lillard has never reached the peaks of Parker's career yet they are in the 75-team really just shows that they were popularity votes and not legacy votes."
"If Damian Lillard is considered top 75, Dwight should be too."
&gt;	What has Damian Lillard done for example to be above him?  Have a fun nickname and be likable.
"I agree that leaving the first 50 unchanged wasn’t the right way to do it, but that shouldn’t matter. At the end of the day, it became the top 25 players of the last 25 years. Howard belongs on that list.   Also, AD is not a Shaq-level player. Damian Lillard is certainly not a Shaq-level player. Comparing their situation to Shaq’s inclusion just isn’t reasonable."
"Dwight has been on an All-NBA team 8 years. This is Damian Lillard's 10th year in the league. Lillard made the team and Dwight did not. Dwight has nearly as many All-NBA selections as Lillard does years in the league, and made it in over Dwight. Inexcusable."
"Just for the record, Dame is on the Athletic 75 list too at [68](https://theathletic.com/2916690/2021/11/10/nba75-at-no-68-damian-lillard-went-from-milk-crate-hoops-to-dame-time-im-just-a-believer/)"
"I personally prefer Dwight Howard over Damian Lillard. But I still don't understand Anthony Davis being in the top 75. Before Lebron, all he managed was an 8th seed. He can't carry teams the way Lillard and Howard do."
"It was really Brooklyn since by that point they were either in their final season playing in NJ or their first season in Brooklyn.   Plus the Nets had D.Will before his ankles went south so it’s not like he wanted to join the Nets all by himself and build something.   Unfortunately for Nets fans we had to deal with the Dwight-mare shortly after the Melo-drama before the Nets traded for D.Will after Melo went to the Knicks.    Another unfortunate thing was D.Will not leaving for Dallas as a Free Agent since the Nets had Goran Dragic lined up to take the PG spot when D.Will was on the fence on a 5yrs Max in Brooklyn vs a 4yr in Dallas.   One of the worst parts of missing out on Dwight Howard was Billy King in a panic move sending a 1st to Portland for Gerald Wallace who was already seeing a decline and was then overpaid just to stay. Nets did that with the hopes of re signing D.Will by showing they were all in on winning.    Nets would have most likely drafted Harrison Barnes since they needed SF depth because at the time it was like 4vs5 when they were on Offense from how poor the SF production was.   If the Nets didn’t trade for Wallace and draft Barnes do the Warriors draft the hometown kid Damian Lillard with the next pick? This was before Curry took that next step and was on that cheap contract he signed because of his sketchy ankles.   Warriors could have easily ran Lillard, Curry, and Klay at the 1-3 spot. May have impacted them signing Durant as a FA since I think they needed to let Barnes leave in order to open up enough cap space."
"Dame.  Spider is great, but he's also on a better team and the Jazz can hide two 6'1 guards with Rudy Gobert in the paint. Jazz also have depth and good shooting around those two.  Damian Lillard is a very special shooter and scorer. Spida still young and can change, and probably will keep adding to his game, so who knows the future? But rn it's easily Dame."

"&gt; Even in today's game where basically any 3-pointer is seen as at least a relatively good shot, to pull up in this situation, down two with 23 seconds to play, with **no chance for an offensive rebound** should you miss because none of your guys have even crossed half court yet, is a bad decision for anyone not named Stephen Curry or Damian Lillard.       Author then proceeds to post a video where Atlanta indeed did get an offensive rebound. Well, not rebound per se, but they kept the possession of the ball. What a clown. Had Trae hit that shot, and he eventually will hit those shots routinely as he progresses his career throughout the years, he'd be a badass hero, deservedly so."

So do Deandre Jordan and Joakim Noah and Damian Lillard
"Terrible analysis. You have literally no idea what your talking about. I have seen Dame with or without CJ a bunch   Either your 15 years old and acting up because KD chose the nets and brought his friends   Or   That Gerald Wallace trade made you hate Dame.   Either way your a fucking idiot who doesn’t understand Damian Lillard, statistical analysis or basketball."
Damian Lillard is a g
Damian Lillard
"Damian Lillard still plays for the Blazers. Steph and Klay with the Warriors. And if Russ wasn't traded he'd probably still be with the Thunder. But yeah, superstars staying with the teams they're drafted is a pretty rare thing but quite understandable considering almost everyone in the league wants immediate success."
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"
"This happens every time a big 3 gets together then in June everyone is like ""well of course they made it, they have 2 superstars and another all nba caliber player""  Charles barkley just told y'all how Damian lillard will win the west but the nets won't make the finals."

"You don't understand how All-NBA works. There isn't a ""PG"" designation. Notice how Damian Lillard, the PG for the team we root for, isn't listed in the spot you mistakenly think is for PGs. Read the link you provided for the positions.  LeBron and Luka were both ELIGIBLE for guard and forward spots. That's objectively true and you are welcome to do a simple google search."

"Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green and Damian Lillard"
"I agree with most of your argument especially with more bigs being projects and guards having a higher floor. But wanted to add for the high level guard play argument that you alluded to is that the key is the older college guards are the ones that hit the ground running at a high level usually...the guys coming in after 3-4 years of college (Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, etc.).   But of the guys coming in at a younger age the only one I really remember playing at a high level in recent memory is Trae Young. We saw good prospects like D-Lo, Lonzo, Fox, etc. really struggle to adapt in their first few years in the NBA before becoming solid players"
"Guards that come into the NBA at an older age (after their junior or senior seasons in college) adapt quicker, like Donovan Mitchell, Malcolm Brogdon, and Damian Lillard. Most guards that leave after their freshman year in college take a while to hit their stride because they aren't as physically mature, the point guard position is in a golden age in the NBA with a lot of good/great veterans, and they don't know the tricks older players do"
Ah yes the Uber efficient Damian Lillard who is a career 40% shooter during the playoffs
"I like Damian Lillard obviously, but this is kinda petty. Imagine how people would perceive someone like KD or Paul George in a situation like this."
I would think Damian lillard would feel like much more of a badass if he eventually wins one in Portland than Durant hopping around the league to these super teams. They’re all getting paid relatively equal. I guess I shouldn’t judge but I respect the guy that works harder to do something unprecedented.
Damian Lillard is the insecure guy's imagination of a confident guy.
Uhh what lol   https://tenor.com/view/damian-lillard-basketball-shoot-cheer-gif-13997327
The Brooklyn Nets have the greatest backcourt of all time.   Damian Lillard will never win a championship.
"""Thats a bad shot""     - Paul ""Damian Lillard"" George"
"They'll be on TV, seen from the bench. A rookie who doesn't play is not going to get huge endorsement money.  Very few rookies are good enough to make the rotation of a contending team, and if they are, they are good enough to get a huge contract somewhere else AND endorsement money regardless of where they end up. Kyrie and LeBron had plenty of endorsements in Cleveland.  Do you know who the top 10 endorsement earners in the NBA are?  LeBron, Curry, Durant, Giannis, Westbrook, Zion, Harden, Irving, Lillard, Thompson.  &gt; The attraction of large media markets for free agents is a common point made by talking heads in sports media, as large markets presumably open doors for athletes to earn more endorsement opportunities.  &gt; However, three of the NBA’s top 10 endorsement earners — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, and Damian Lillard — all currently play in small-to-medium NBA markets. Additionally, Russell Westbrook had spent his career in Oklahoma City, the NBA’s smallest market, prior to joining the Houston Rockets this season.   &gt; While massive media markets may offer an advantage for off-court earning potential, this list shows that on-court success and personal brand building impact player endorsement value far more than the size of their market alone.   https://opendorse.com/blog/nba-top-10-endorsement-earners/  Zion would've got a near max equivalent and huge endorsements no matter where he went, he is not signing a minimum to ring chase as a 20 year old.  The idea that players go to New York or LA and immediately get big endorsements is based on pre-internet logic where you could only watch players on local tv. Knicks are the biggest market and have no players on that list. The only NY/LA players there were already superstars before joining. Giannis is doing just fine."
When I grow up I want to be JUST like Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard will be 6-14 from that range in a couple of years
“Plenty picks” Sam “Damian Lillard” Presti
"Cavs are working on a master plan to take over the league.  Step 1: Acquire every center in the league.  Step 2: you now have a monopoly on centers  Step 3: trade your Cs at an unbelievably bloated price, roughly at a JaVale McGee for Damian Lillard rate.  Step 4: break Bill Russell's 8 in a row record."
"Why?  And for who?    You do know about salary matching, right?  With the combined cap numbers for Drummond and Love, pretty much the only players they could trade in return would be.... Damian Lillard and like another $5 million player....... or both CJ McCollum and Nurkic AND an additional ~$20 million worth of players.  Seems super likely, to get the services of Kevin Love and Andre Drummond.  /s  There is absolutely no one who is going to take both Drummond and Love off your hands at the same time.  That's a fantasy."
rockets about to draft the next damian lillard?
"&gt;If Harden wants out that's one thing, you can do that without playing like dogshit and throwing your teammates under the bus.  I mean, he's still played every game. Averaging 36.5 minutes a game. Leading the league in assists, grabbing almost 7 boards and scoring 25 a night. You are making it seem like he is pulling a VC.   &gt;Off the top of my head Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Giannis and Bradley Beal are all superstar players who can do what you seem to think is impossible for James.  1. If Harden had the supporting cast that Steph had his entire run, he'd be sitting comfortably with the same amount of chips and wouldn't care about how the Rockets are now because he'd have his. But he didn't. CP3 got hurt and he never got his chance to get his again because his teams never had the same talent as the other contenders.   2. Giannis JUST signed a supermax. It's the next one that would be comparable to Hardens tenure with the Rockets. Same for Beal. His rookie deal he has no say in. Harden didn't ask to be traded from OKC.   3. Yeah, Dame is special and there's a reason he's so loved by that city. But he's also not on Harden's level and has lower expectations (and is held to a lower standard)"
"If Harden wants out that's one thing, you can do that without playing like dogshit and throwing your teammates under the bus.  The way Harden is choosing to go about this is incredibly selfish and disrespectful to his team.  Take the PG-13/Westbrook route and quietly go to management to tell them you want out, play like a pro while they find a deal and handle your business like an adult.   Off the top of my head Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Giannis and Bradley Beal are all superstar players who can do what you seem to think is impossible for James.  They've all stayed with their teams and are committed to setting the tone &amp; creating a culture for their organizations despite challenges.  You say that LeBron hasn't stuck around a single team for 8 years, but he's also never done anything close to what Harden is doing right now with 2 years left on his deal.   CP3 played more off ball and transitioned to being a secondary piece pretty well when he was in Houston.  Can he be prickly &amp; rub some players the wrong way? Sure, but in retrospect let's look at who those players are &amp; what their make-up is.  I'm more inclined to side with CP3 on this one, it's hard for a team to function when your superstar stands around any time he doesn't have the ball."
"Over Westbrook? Okay. Over CP3? He’s old so I’ll give that one to you (although CP3 is still in my opinion a better player, certainly a better leader). Over Damian Lillard? That’s just crazy talk."
"Everybody says the dude is an amazing teamate and lea...  wait, nevermind I thought this was the Damian Lillard thread."
Lol I like Damian Lillard but I really don’t feel bad at all here - what you’re describing minus the travel sounds like what a lot us are going through and we don’t make $30 mil a year
And... That's why Damian Lillard is such a person of respect.
Damian Lillard is one of us
"Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, 'Treatment is simple. Great point guard Damian Lillard is in town tonight. Go and see him play. That should pick you up.' Man bursts into tears. Says, ""But doctor…I am Damian Lillard."" Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains."
TIL: I am Damian Lillard
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13.

Not top 25 and after that who gives a shit.  Active point guards that are better  - Chris Paul - Kyle Lowry - Russell Westbrook - Damian Lillard - Mike Conley (iffy) - Steph Curry - D-Rose  At least that wouldn’t surprise me If I’m missing some
"According to [Basketball-Reference HOF probability](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html), Kevin Love has a higher chance of making it right now.  Grant Hill had an amazing college career with 2 championships on top of his great NBA career, where people debated if he would have been better than MJ without his ankle injuries.  Yao Ming is in the Hall more for his cultural and international impact than his NBA career.  Tracy McGrady was one the best scorers the league has ever seen and was debated as the best SG with Kobe for most of a decade.  The defining guards of this generation, the 2010s decade, are:  Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Damian Lillard.  Kyrie gets an honorable mention, but he's closer to a DeRozan than he is to that list."
"Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, most other shooting gods"
"if that was called for every player, jusuf nurkic and damian lillard would get somebody ejected every single game"
"I'm not a big baseball fan so I could be off but baseball seems like more of a sport where you can utilize your raw skill alot easier. If you're batting its just you batting against the pitcher (albeit these pitchers are way better than any level the rookie would have played at). In the field youre chasing a ball for a catch and following the same fundamentals youd have learned at other levels as far as who to pass to to stop runners.  In basketball there's so many moving pieces, and even if you get a 1 on 1 matchup you have to learn how to read the defense as a rookie because even if you make a great move the help defense can recover and shut you off. As a Blazers fan I remember Damian Lillard never had a problem blowing by the first line of defense, but he had to learn how to work around the NBA having so many big shot blockers by either getting creative with the finish or finding an open man. Early on he would just try to go over everyone or think he'd be fast enough to get the layup off before the shot blocker was there and it resulted in his shot getting blocked alot.  Baseball might feel more like you're playing the same game where basketball at the NBA level has a huge learning curve. Again I could be way off base but with my limited baseball knowledge that would be my best guess"

Damian Lillard and now Stephen Curry?! Paul George is getting bounced around like a ping pong these days...smh
"I'm as big a Curry fan as they come, but I do think it was at least *possible* for Lillard to be better than Steph at this point in their careers. Lillard was coming off a career-best 30/8/4 on 46/40/88 last season. That's absolutely *insane* - closest we've seen to Steph's historic 2016 campaign.   Lillard just dragged his team into the playoffs in spectacular fashion. He's a couple years younger than Steph, appeared to have a better team around him, and Steph was coming off a significant injury on a team where he'd have far more defensive attention and far less spacing than maybe any other point in his career.  All that being the case, I think it was entirely reasonable to predict that Damian would at least appear to be the better player this season. But boy is it fun to watch Steph prove that wrong so far."
He's also 10-0 in the playoffs against Damian fraud Lillard
"You can see it on the floor this season. Its weird, Damian lillard although great and can explode anytime doesn’t look like the most impactful player on the court. Seems like the teams figured out all you need to do is throw double teams at him to make him less effective."

"Lmao why are yall getting so salty over a pretty innocent quote  All he said was because of the injuries to guys like Klay and the departure of KD, it was harder for Steph to find as good of looks as he was getting. That's a very obvious statement and clearly no disrespect intended. No shit losing 2 of the best shooters of all time around you would make it harder to get open as often.  Even Kerr agreed and said ""Damian Lillard was right to say that"""
I see people not including Giannis because of his Playoff struggles I'd imagine. But his last two playoffs still have him with better stats than some of the names ahead of him. Like Damian Lillard. He's a better scorer than Giannis? Except Giannis basically puts up the same points and assists with much better FG%. The only real edges Dame having being his 3pt% and ft%.

Damian Lillard. Probably the biggest most non talked about example.
"I don't know why you are so hung up on Korver. Players like Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, etc. are all more valuable (and therefore ""better"" shooters than Korver).

"Damian Lillard is standing right there.  Man, do I love me some Curry."
"LeBron hasn't been the best player in the league since 2005 man come on. It was around 2010-2012 that he finally became the best in the league. Accolades absolutely display a player's accomplishments. They're flawed, but definitely contribute to a player's legacy in a big way. It's why you can look at hardens 2018 Vs beals 2020 and deem one season significantly better than the other(just one example that comes to mind, there are better examples out there of similar stat lines but the accolade is what gives the context of how the person's performance was perceived).  PG defense is less important because 1. You're never going to stop the best guards from scoring. Whether you put Kyrie or cp3 on curry he's giving you 30+ on similar efficiency. Additionally, if a guard shoots a contested 3 from 30 feet your defense doesn't really fall apart. That was still a bad shot and the defense doesn't adjust to deny that shot. However, if a center is feasting or even has a mismatch in the post the probability of that possession translating to a bucket is extremely high, so you have to change your scheme by sending a double team or subbing in a big man that's better suited to guarding the other teams center. Also, if you have a good defensive big man as an anchor your defense as a whole can focus more on the perimeter because the paint is locked down. One guy can lock down a crucial area of the court which translates to a good defensive team. Your example of bogut being an elite defender fits this perfectly.  8 points is the difference between Damian Lillard and Andrew Wiggins last season. Sure, assists are great and cp3s passing and vision is better than currys, but their seasons were incredibly different. Cp3 had a great season in that MVP level year but curry was other-worldly. Cp3 shot 50/36/87 in 09, which is fantastic, but Steph shot 50/45/90 on 4 more shot attempts, along with of course shooting from half court and shooting a ridiculous amount of full court heaves. Curry also did this in 4 minutes less than cp3, which is substantial over the course of a full season. Also, as much of a copout as it feels like to bring up intangibles, the playstyle of curry and cp3 is drastically different on offense. Curry played far more off ball than cp3 in their respective seasons and obviously drew a ton of double teams, so while he did average less assists than Chris, I assume the amount of open looks and easy baskets he generated(and still generates) outweigh the amount that cp3 generated. This point is admittedly down to opinion though, as there's nothing that measures this stat.  By the way, of course cp3s teammates have never been as good as curry had from 2017-2019, but let's not act like Blake, deandre Jordan, harden were bums. If anything, Currys ppg would lower, like they did, by playing next to more stars, and his assists would lower too due to playing off ball more. Cp3 was definitely playing with bums in New Orleans though."
"it's one of the many things that make him so, so special and the franchise cornerstone you want on any team.  People make the Duncan comp more these days and it really is true.  You never heard Tim Duncan engage with any of the noise about him vs. KG or Dirk, and he never worried about making sure people knew he was the best player in the NBA every season, he'd let his game do the talking for him on his way to 5 rings and a career winning % of like 70%.     You know that inside he wants to say it because it's true, but going out there and declaring ""I'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet"" puts himself in front of the team and that just isn't it for Steph because the only thing that matters is what he does on the court.  There's really nobody else like him in the game today, maybe Damian Lillard but Steph is on another level."
Hot take: He's better than Damian Lillard. His 2020 playoff run was literally better than anything Dame has ever done in his career.
"Steph Curry continues to own the fraud Damian Lillard, who was out there getting clowned by Kelly Oubre. Sad."
"They said Giannis was better, he stayed silent. They said Harden was better, he stayed silent. They said Jimmy Butler was better, he started to pay attention. They said damian lillard was better....That man popped off on god LMAO.  r/NBA can suck its analytics, steph curry the face of the nba after bron since 2014, and don't ya'll forget."
Damian Lillard bout to get red weddinged
So now you know Curry now has a higher career high than:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Damian Lillard  James Harden  Shaquille O’Neal  Anthony Davis
Okay I’ve never tried this before let me see how it fits:  Man Damian Lillard looks washed. His body language is totally wrong. He can’t carry a team or lead one. Should the Blazers trade him for Harden?  Okay no I did not like how that made me feel
Damian Lillard is real life space jam so far this year.
"Yup..    1. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  2. Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks  3. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  6.

"What's the deal with athletes going vegan? Is meat/animal products really that bad for you? I would assume it's the opposite.  I've heard of a ton of athletes doing it, including Cam Newton and (I think) Damian Lillard."
"Absolutely. Blazers beat themselves. It was a devastating loss and another devastating moment in the Blazers somewhat painful team history. If that 2000 Blazer team had a weakness, it was a lack of a closer. Wallace was the best player, but shied away from any leadership responsibility. Pippen was probably the de facto leader, but it was also his first season with the team and he had issues with the closer role even with the Bulls. I actually thought Stoudamire had the best mental makeup for those critical possession shots because he liked the attention and challenge, but his role with the team was shaky and he wasn't at peak confidence that season. It should have been Steve Smith, but I don't think he'd been that deep into the playoffs before and maybe the stakes were too much. What they really needed was Brandon Roy or Damian Lillard, guys who are money when you really need a basket. That's the story of the franchise. Bad timing, bad breaks, woulda coulda shoulda."
"Stop calling Damian Lillard, Dame too. It’s better when the commentary remains official and professional."
Jesus I’m a Wall fan but come on. CP passing skills-and more importantly understanding of the game and ability to see ahead-is vastly different than Wall. You really might as well say Austin Rivers is Damian Lillard lite if you’re going to make that kind of comparison...
Leaving out Damian Lillard. Funny.
"So your entire argument is predicated on box score metrics and small sample sizes from a handful of games. Sure, we can talk about a David Robinson/Sabonis head to head, but there's more context. Who had the better supporting cast? How many possessions did they play 1 on 1? Who had more impact on offense and defense. We would need to look at impact metrics, on/off numbers, etc, and that would require quantifying the entire olympic run. Same as with the Dream Team game. And, to your point about his production being identical from Russia to the NBA, isn't that a bonus for Sabonis? He had no significant drop off in production when moving from an inferior league to a superior one even after multiple knee injuries? Plus, rebounding doesn't quantify his defensive impact, Kareem was able to manage to maintain all star level offensive impact (when looking at impact metrics and on/off numbers) until the age of 38, but his defense began to taper off around 30. Also, how good were the perimeter defenders around Sabonis during the Olympics/Russia? There's only so much a rim protector can do if multiple players are attacking the cup at once. Why do you think modern centers are dismantled in drop coverage so easily? Sure, on a very basic level, your point holds some weight. However, it lacks context and nuance, anyone can see that Sabonis was as skilled, if not more skilled, than the best centers in the NBA during his era, and there's no doubt a young Sabonis, who is able to play and grow under stronger competition would develop into a better player. Damian Lillard and Steve Nash played 4 years in college, and wasllere good, but didn't make the jump to superstar until their late 20s. Who's to say Sabonis wouldn't have a similar jump if exposed to NBA talent earlier? The case of Sabonis is a sad one, the cold war sucked for everyone, and it robbed us of one of the most exciting players that never was. Sabonis's floor, as you mentioned, is a borderline all star player. But what about a Sabonis in his defensive prime? What about a Sabonis who grew up playing against NBA players? What about a Sabonis who is treated as a franchise cornerstone rather than a high usage roleplayer? There's no way to know, but I would venture to say, Sabonis would be Jokic-like offensively while maintaining plus defense, and be a strong contender for All NBA 1st team yearly."
"well, this is a well documented occurrence in the nba, but if you want more explanation, coaches also go harder in the playoffs. schemes can be written to counter one team instead of 29. say your favorite team is playing the Lakers and bucks in the same week. writing a scheme to attack harrell relentlessly to get points is fantastic when you play the Lakers (albeit they do obv have AD as well but that's beside the point), if you try using the same scheme on giannis, it won't get you very far.  another example, damian lillard. amazing high scoring point guard in the regular season, in the playoffs he gets locked down defensively, draws double teams, doesn't look like the same guy. giannis last playoffs got locked down and the bucks entire offense shut down. of course there are always exceptions to the rule such as harden who could show up to a playoff game still drunk and drop 20 points"

"The Blazers.  I've lived in Portland since 2003 and they're my regular watch.  It was dark at the beginning but mostly rewarding since the Brandon Roy era.  I love Damian Lillard as much or more than I've loved any non-Celtic (and plenty of Celtics, too)."

Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Nikola Jokic  Stephen Curry  LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard
&gt; Damian Lillard appears sick  *panik*  &gt; and tired of NBA officiating  *kalm*
"According to stats, Damian Lillard is a slightly above shooter, if you follow the typical route of 36% is average, 40% is good and 45% is elite. He's averaged over 38% twice so far, at his best. Maxi Kleber would also be having a better shooting year than Lillard has ever had."
"Crazy how he is even in the discussion tbh, it's totally media fabricated. Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry all have played better during this season than LeBron, heck, even Kawhi in his own city when you consider his defense and his efficiency is more deserving."
Luka Doncic is better than Damian Lillard.
Damian Lillard just said “must be the shoes”  How the hell is that disrespectful?
"Damian ""Steph Curry"" Lillard"
Damian Lillard is unbelievable man. Dudes feet were literally planted in the mid court logo for a buzzer beater
Damian Lillard is unbelievable man. Dudes feet were literally planted in the mid court logo for a buzzer beater
"Because those are less important shots, dame draws contact as par of his game and won’t always get the call, and he’s 6’2. A Damian lillard blazers team is an elite offense every year, no matter who’s on the court. Comparing him to WB in this regard is insane."
"We have tons of players with that mentality, like Lebron James, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Brad Wanamaker, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, ect ect."
"&gt; I know this sub is stat obsessed, but the entire point of sports is to win the games   By that logic, Donovan Mitchell should be starting the All Star game over Damian Lillard and this argument is moot."
"He doesn’t deserve it as much as Dame, that’s silly. Dame has carried a team to the 4th seed in the west so far with both his second and third best players missing significant time, meanwhile Luka is on maybe the most underperforming team in the league.   I know this sub is stat obsessed, but the entire point of sports is to win the games, and there has maybe been 2 other guys even in the same league as Damian Lillard as impacting winning so far this year."

I’ll have you know Damian Lillard has TWO first round walk offs in NBA history  /s
"Out of established stars, it's gotta be Damian Lillard."
"Just highlights some separate issues here.   1.  Relying on a fan vote for starters, basically just becomes a popularity contest.  Heck people literally just submit votes for everyone on their team whether they deserve it or not ""like me"" each year, and the idea you can vote as much as you want just encourages well known players at the top to just stay there.  I like the idea of the final spot being a fan vote, but not the whole starting team.   2.  Highlights also why we can't go by subjective criteria like ""Nobody is more feared then Damian Lillard"".  What does this even mean?  That people would rather face Lebron or Kevin Durant instead of Damian Lillard, therefore he should be an All Star Starter?  Highly subjective and by no means indicative of who truly ""deserves"" to be an All Star (which itself is also subjective, maybe people do think Damian Lillard should start solely because he is ""feared"", who knows right.   3.  Siakam's first name is Pascal"
What a scam! Everyone knows the two best guards in the west and prolly NBA are Damian Lillard and steph curry kyrie good when he’s not on some BS or talking.
"Oh my word, why do people want to shit on Shaq at every opportunity? He's praising Damian Lillard, with whom he literally had a rap beef, yet your take is ""Shaq hates luka"". He even said he's not mad at the way the voting went. Give it a rest. Y'all more salty than him."
"Lol he really called Damian ""Damon"" Lillard. Cmon Shaq I know you're bad with names but put some respek on his name"
"Replace him with anyone and the Jazz doesn't work the way that they're currently configured. Domas is about on Rudy's level as  a screen setter, but he can't roll the same way that Rudy can. AD is a great lob catcher and finisher., potentially the best ever, but he's not the same active screener, and while he's perceived as more switchable 1-5 than Gobert, he's not as impactful defensively. Joel is a great paint patroller when he's locked in, but he's never had the level of consistent focus and effort, and he's never been as active off ball as Rudy on the offensive end. I guess the closest comp for Rudy as a player in the NBA is like, a better versio of Myles Turner's, a better (and healthier) version of Clint Capela's lob game, and the offensive screening activity of Steven Adams, except instead of just being ""borderline elite"" at those things, he's like, top two in the league in all of them. No other player in the NBA can lay claim to being that skilled in all three areas. Full stop. The only player he's really comparable to in all of NBA history in terms of his skillset and his proficiency in those skills is Dikembe Mutombo. He'll go down as one of the all-time five best defensive players in NBA history.  Mitchell is good. Like, *really good*. His stats don't show it because he's really unselfish in a system that doesn't rack up a ton of assists, but he's an elite scorer and an elite passer who could really grow into a Damian Lillard type of player as a borderline MVP candidate staying loyal to his home market for years, and he's shown to really be able to kick it up a notch in high-pressure situations. The Wade comps, while a little premature, also make a ton of sense. But as it stands right now, he's a guy who's around the top-20 mark in the NBA and he's a talented scorer, if a bit inefficient in the regular season. But he can get his own shot, he can pass, and he can score at all three levels in spite of his size. But that also describes a *ton* of guys in the NBA; Lavine, Sexton, Trae, Jamal, all guys who are (in my opinion) at least one step below Mitchell but who could fill a very similar role in this Jazz team without much of a struggle. Plus, one knock against Mitchell is that there are guys who do the same thing as him but better - Dame, Steph, Harden, Kyrie, all those guys I'd trust to fill his role in the Jazz' offense without missing a beat. Mitchell still has room to grow, he's not even 25 yet and his game will improve a lot with age and experience. But Gobert? He's irreplaceable. Nobody in the NBA can do what he does. And I say this as the biggest Mitchell stan in the world."
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
"&gt;but nobody is feared in the game than Damian Lillard.    Yeh.. okay SHAQ. Always gotta throw in some stupid shit in between the lines, even though most of everything else he said is quite true.   &gt;  Chuck does the same thing. There's always some stupid shit that makes no sense, and completely hyperbolic..  &gt;  Dame didn't get in as a starter because he's a Point Guard, and that position is booked by someone else.  How many under 6'2 small guards they'd have let in the starting 5? Curry obviously will get that PG spot  &gt;  Dame is too small to get in as a 2 guard. He also got much less votes than Doncic, so there's no tie breaker there."
Damian Lillard is an All-Star starter. The disrespect is real
"He can and does quite regularly. Here’s a good article from last season  &gt; Anunoby's isolation stats are eye-popping. He ranks in the 94th percentile in isolation defense, according to NBA Advanced Stats, surrendering 0.61 pointer per possession in isolation. Of players who have played at least 48 games this year, Anunoby ranked 14th in isolation defense, immediately behind Kawhi Leonard. While being in the 94th percentile is impressive, it's Anunoby's versatility that makes him truly special in isolation. Of players with a minimum of 2000 possessions, Anunoby led the NBA this season in Versatility, a stat created by Krishna Narsu that attempts to measure how often a player defends different positions. He played 24% of his time defending small forwards, another 24% of his time on shooting guards, 22% of his time on power forwards, and 16 and 13 percent of his time defending point guards and centers, respectively.  [source](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/is-og-anunoby-the-best-isolation-defender-in-the-nba)  I’ve seen Nurse assign him as a primary defender on both Damian Lillard and Bam Adebayo and made them both struggle. Dude is as versatile a defender as they come, one of the few players who can truly guard 1-5."

Damian Lillard is especially good at it. He really waved around the chip on his shoulder over it that one year and then got swept by the Pelicans in the first round lmao
"Lmao. Curry, Harden, KD, Lebron, Giannis, Kawhi, AD. Damian “shoots 40% in the playoffs” Lillard is definitely not a Tier 1 best player on a championship team superstar."

"Well you're obviously a Harden stan, but oh well:  https://pickinsplinters.com/2020/05/14/breaking-down-james-hardens-postseason-inefficiency/  The main issue here is, just as he has forced his scoring average up by manipulating bad officiating rules, Harden has forced himself into being a mediocre shooter with poor mechanics and exceptional range, and you portray him as a great shooter. Bullshit. Stephen Curry is a great shooter, Joe Harris is a great shooter, Duncan Robinson, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, are great shooters. Harden is the China of basketball, just a manufactured knock off version of the real deal born out of a dynamic of competitive necessity following the dominance of Curry. He's boring to watch, and he won't win a ring on his own merits. Your favorite player is kind of....shit."
"Bruh, i love wrist watches and Damian Lillard. I'm gonna def try and get me a dame watch."
"Here's the thing mate, Bill Walton has the peak, Drexler has the accolades. But neither showed much love after their careers in Portland were over. There was no reciprocation. The team soured their relationship with Walton by forcing him to play and Drexler entered the HoF as a Rocket. To tell Portland fans that those two should be our only picks is condescending.   If Brandon Roy were healthy, it would have been a question of how many, not if. Even without Oden, Roy was a monster of advanced stats like no other. The type of player to get [32 on 9/11 FG](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201001080POR.html) in the same game that Kobe would get 32 on 14/37 FG. So yeah, Roy would have probably been The One. But his injuries are what led us to drafting Damian Lillard. And that's why he's not.  Dame might not have that efficiency, but he has the longevity that Walton doesn't and he's quickly matching Drexler's hardware. Drexler never won an MVP either, so even if Dame never wins a chip, he would dust Drexler with a regular season MVP. Moreover, Dame has the reciprocated love. He loves Portland and Portland loves Dame. Just for emphasis, I'm on record saying **we should carve his face into the Tualitin Hills, Mount Rushmore style,** if he ever brings a championship to Portland.    Blazer fans get to choose. Not you. And we choose Dame."
"I think Blazers fans are just tired of feeling like our guy is always underrated. I mean c'mon, name a player better than Damian Lillard who's never started a single All-Star game.   Dude's had exactly ONE teammate make an all-star game (Lamarcus Aldridge way back in the day) and yet he makes the playoffs every single year, even taking a team to the conference finals. Dude is pretty legit, but every time there's a ""well....this award could go to either player"" type situation, its pretty much never Dame.   Realistically though, there are probably just far fewer people watching Blazers games than just about any team in the league."
Damian Lillard is 30 years old who never ever sacrificed even a little bit of his offense in order for his team to become better. Thirty years old!!! He will never change.
&gt; so the players and media all thought dame should start but  &gt; Damian Lillard and Luka Doncic were tied in votes  ?
Inb4 The resurgence of the “Damian Lillard is the most underrated player in the league” takes
In some order the best Trail Blazers of All-Time are:  - Clyde Drexler  - Bill Walton (career derailed by injuries)  - Brandon Roy (career derailed by injuries)  - Damian Lillard  - Terry Porter  - Geoff Petrie (career derailed by injuries)  So yeah about half.
I’d sell both my balls to see Brandon Roy and Damian Lillard in there primes play on the blazers together
"Nets picks have turned out to be: Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, and motherfuckin' Colin Sexton.  Nets picks when used by anyone else are all-stars."
"D-Will with Quin as his HC-- instead of ""boomer w/dementia"" Jerry Sloan--is a sexually arousing thought experiment as a Jazz fan.   At the same time, Damian Lillard.   ....I can't give an answer here."
"I feel bad for Arenas. He played 234 games in 3 years, an average of 78 a season from age 23-25, and averaged 28/4/6, and made two 3rd and a 2nd team. No reason to think his career couldn’t continue on a Damian Lillard trajectory. Then he missed 199 games in 3 years and was never the same. He played 87 games after that."

"Black, white, male, female... It doesn't matter.  I mean I'm sure it matters, but not in this case.   A player signs a contract. The player also probably has an agent and some lawyers to help him read the legal nonsense. I would imagine it says that the team and player agree to do whatever is best for the team, which is determined by the GM and the coach.   There are verrrry few white stars at the level of James Harden, but let's say Luka got tired of playing for the mavs and started parting at strip clubs during the pandemic and dragging ass on the court. You don't think people would be shitting on him?  Do you think Charlotte would keep playing Gordon Hayward if they were trying to trade him and he was playing like dog shit?  I agree with draymond from a media and fan perspective. People expect loyalty from players but not from teams. But that isn't a race issue. That is a narrative that the sports world has been running with for decades.   Remember that the next time you suck off MJ and Kobe for staying with their teams. Remember that what Damian Lillard retires with Portland and hasn't made the finals."

originally known as damian lillard syndrome
"https://www.google.ch/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/blazers/what-if-damian-lillard-only-shot-35-feet  6/9 last season only, this is updated till March 2020. The game winner on Paul George (yeah a random dude, a bad defender yk) was 37 feet. So yeah, I think it’s nothing compared to where dame shoots from"
https://www.google.ch/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/damian-lillard-is-the-longest-shot-in-the-nba-11597834801  125 shots in a season. From 30 to 40 feet. That’s further than the MTW rack.
[Lillard took more than 100 shots from further last season](https://www.google.ch/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/damian-lillard-is-the-longest-shot-in-the-nba-11597834801)  Looks like you don’t know what you are talking about
"Zach Collins was picked at #10.  Meyers Leonard was picked at #11.  Instead of making moves to maximize the core they have &amp; give Damian Lillard the best chance to win the title, he drafts long-odds project players that won't develop (if they do at all) until well after Dame &amp; CJ have hit their primes.     If you think Olshey belongs anywhere ahead of Bob Myers, Masai, Dennis Lindsey, Danny Ainge, Sam Presti, Pat Riley, RC Buford/Brian Wright, Donnie Nelson, Daryl Morey, Sean Marks, Tim Connelly, Lawrence Frank or Rob Pelinka/LeGM you are high on bath salts."
Damian Lillard.
"Alex Caruso being on a team with a good record does not make him a better player than Damian Lillard. The reason I brought up efficiency is because it is a huge part in determining whether stats are or are not legitimate. Besides, Jokic' win% this season is 2% lower than Russ' MVP season, and when he actually had some semblance of a team around him in the last 2 years, Denver has finished 2nd and 3rd in the conference. Foh."
Does anyone know where I can buy that Damian Lillard jersey?  I've been looking for weeks but it's sold out everywhere and I'm not sure of they'll be back in stock?
Mark my words: History will remember Damian Lillard.
"Listen I know Blazer games are on late, so maybe you don’t watch them but, and I say this with the deepest affection, Damian Lillard is in a different class than CJ McCollum. Give him a big who screens and finishes well and a few shooters, you’ll have a top 5-8 offense. He’s that good. When he’s on the floor, I know the offense is going to run, even if it’s not running through him. Have you ever looked at Lillard’ on/off splits? They get out scored by like a million in the 12 minutes he doesn’t play. CJ McCollum is a fucking nuclear bomb. He can go for 50 in three quarters. What he did was extend his range out a few feet, so instead of taking tough isolation twos and hitting them at an astounding rate, he now takes tough isolation threes and hits them at astounding rates. Plus he’s a better passer this season. But you don’t get the amount of single coverage he gets without a guy that can casually step into 35 footers or drive to the basket in a blink. Not to take anything at all away from CJ, but he definitely benefits from playing alongside Dame, in the same way Klay benefits from playing alongside Steph, even when Steph has an off game or two."
Lillard Damian my favourite pg
"Yeah, I mean, I won't pretend I'm Damian Lillard, but I can shoot and shoot with range. After enough of them from all over the court it's truly all just feel and instinct. Pretty wild to do it as a stepback, to a top flite defender from 33ft in the clutch lmao. Absurd"
"Damian Lillard.  I live in Portland so the Blazers are my regular team to watch, it's been immensely enjoyable to watch Dame for his whole career."
Damian Lillard
"You’re really overemphasizing how important individual defence is. Like sure, if you’re a rookie or a g league come up you have to play D, but when you’re *Damian Lillard?* it doesn’t matter. You surround him with 4 above average to elite defenders and the magic will fall in place. The Blazers have a shit defensive culture overall with weak defenders lining up multiple positions. It’s not just Dame"
I moved Drexler to SF and would probably start Rasheed over LMA just because Aldridge left Portland in a dishonest way. Dame even flew to see him in LA to let him know how important he was to the team and the bitch LMA wouldn’t even see him in person.  https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-talk-aldridge-no-sales-pitch

"“How impressive is Robinson’s accomplishment? No other player in NBA history has even made 400 threes in their first 152 regular-season games.  Behind Robinson, Hornets guard Devonte’ Graham is next on the list with 384 made three-pointers in his first 152 games. Then comes Doncic (379 threes), Atlanta’s Trae Young (378 threes) and Portland’s Damian Lillard (374 threes).”"
"Damian Lillard,  8 year old me watching the playoffs with my family, .9 seconds on the clock."
"Lmao in what world?  Damian Lillard missed 2 weeks with plantar fasciitis in 2015. Goran Dragic played through it in the Finals last year and then was fine pretty soon after in the offseason. Google will tell you the average recovery for this injury in the NBA is around 3-5 weeks. I have never once in my life seen somebody miss **two months** with plantar fasciitis, so I'm gunna absolutely call bullshit on this.   Unless he completely tore his plantar fascia this is just trying to rationalize the stupid tanking by OKC."
give us Damian Lillard
Just think of what you could draft first round picks! They could even become Damian Lillard!
What’s the counter-example then? That Damian Lillard hasn’t openly demanded a trade...yet?

His DBPM is -0.4 so yeah he's a bit below average but not at Damian lillard Levels of bad

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
Damian Lillard waved the bubble suns goodbye in a way
You thought a Chris Haynes article was going to a hit piece about Damian Lillard?  Those 2 are super tight lol.
"&gt;Simply put, Lillard has not received the help he needs to win a title in this era. As he turns 31 this summer and considering all he’s done for the franchise, a more aggressive, risky approach is needed in order to pair him with another bona fide star.  I thought the article would be some kind of nasty hit piece. It was extraordinarily complementary of Lillard and criticized the front office for not surrounding him with enough talent for a legit championship run. Doesn't seem like a very outlandish take.  https://sports.yahoo.com/is-damian-lillard-fighting-the-good-fight-alone-in-portland-150030460.html"
Well they don't have a Damian Lillard
He's back! Damian Lillard is back!
"**If Damian Lillard dribble it up, you guard him. I don't care if that's CJ McCollum, I don't care if that's Michael Jordan, you pick him up. That's the ball right there and Dame got it. He gon shoot it from the NBA.**"
It is when its Damian lillard shooting

"Depends where you ask. On this subreddit I think he's overrated. Despite his counting stats and longevity, If my goal is to win a championship I wouldn't pick him over Magic Johnson, Steph Curry, Oscar Robertson, Isiah Thomas, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Walt Fraizer, or Damian Lillard. But a lot of people here would have him ranked as the 3rd best pg ever based on stats alone."
"&gt; He had Embiid along with Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.       Thoughts guys? I'd personally be putting Giannis, Kawhi, Harden and Jokic all before Dame. Lillard is in that back end top 10 with AD and Luka for me."
"he doesn’t complain about reffing anymore than lebron or damian lillard do, or most stars for that matter. even kawhi complained about reffing during their last game against the nets.  if you wanna argue otherwise that he “always” complains (despite him not even talking about reffing after last night’s loss) you gotta show some proof"
Not for Damian Lillard. From what I've seen of their offense I'll take a Dame deep stepback three over most of their options.
"In what way? Damian Lillard averages more points in the playoffs, more assists and only 2.5 less rebounds per game. Steals and blocks per game are nearly identical. And that’s for a point guard in Damian Lillard that some say is a defensive liability"
"Ok, I'll take the bait.

Damian lillard...   KD is actually a good pick too
"In retrospect the amount of talent in the league is a lot higher than it was in the early 2010s.  Sure, there was prime LeBron/Wade/Paul and the early part of Durant’s prime, but also a bunch of players who never got over the hump and players from earlier generations who were clearly past their peak.   In comparison, in the past few years LeBron and Durant have still been playing at a high level, and there’s also players like Harden/Curry/Davis/Antetokounmpo/Leonard/Doncic/Jokic/Embiid, pretty much any of whom would have been playing at a top 5 level in the league circa 2012 or so.   It’s possible some of this is availability bias — maybe we’ll eventually think of Damian Lillard like Kevin Love if he never wins anything, but Lillard is miles better as a player than Love was."
"I'll fault coach on this one.  Derrick Jones is tremendous catching alley-oops around the hoop. One opportunity DJJ has not gotten is to share the court with Nurkic. Who is a great passer. Damian Lillard and CJ both see hard doubles off the pick and roll opening up the pocket pass to the screener who is a very good passer.   If Dame/CJ can hit Nurk with that pocket pass, that opens up a 4v3 run to the hoop where DJJ can hover around the hoop waiting for lobs. Kanter did not have the ability to make this pass, but I think Nurkic would excel at it.  Unfortunately, once Nurkic has come back, DJJ has been benched which I think is extremely dumb. I'd prefer he starts to maximize his time with Nurk.     I didn't watch a ton of Heat last year, but I'd imagine Bam hit DJJ with a lot of these opportunities given he averaged 5 assists, and 78% of DJJ's 2s were assisted.  Can any Heat fans confirm if DJJ lived in the dunker spot on the P&amp;R last year?"
New entries are Trae Young and Damian Lillard lmao.   Trae however has seen less and less since his team has been winning. But at the beginning? damn lol

"Watch the national games.  For comedy and entertainment watch Inside the NBA on TNT.  If you see a game coming up with a great player, watch it.  You'll catch nuggets of wisdom on why they are great from the better announcers.  You will also see at least a couple of spectacular plays every game where you wonder how they managed to do it.  Watch for the players, coaches, and owners that interest you since we don't have a team in Seattle currently.  I personally like watching the Spurs because of Coach Popovich.  I like Coach McMillan's defensive coaching, and he's Mr. Sonic so I'll watch if he's coaching a game.  I'll sometimes turn on a Mavericks game because Mark Cuban is interesting.  If I see Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron, Curry, Damian Lillard, Harden, or some other great I'll stop and watch it.  Heck I'll even turn on Sabonis because I like his dad or Robin Lopez to watch his hook shot."
"Like u/ThatBull_cj noted, you're using possessions/game for 48min here rather than possessions played by these players.

"You missed it again, you arent reading.  Everybody is a different player game to game and everyone has injuries, especially this deep in the season.  I could say ""Hey curry rolled his ankle and has been carrying the Warriors all year! Hes not 100%!"" or ""Hey Damian Lillard is only in a drought because hes probably injured!"" or ""Hey Kawhi Leonard isnt 100% and has been playing too many games, remember his history of sitting out games?  Thats why he only had 19 points!"" or ""Jokic was slowing down because hes been fouled all year with no refs calling it and is getting worn down!""  The list goes on, everyone isnt at 100%.  If you are out there, you are out there because you arent completely injured like every other player."
"Well that’s the point. When Russ did it during his mvp season it was impressive because he was doing it while playing at a top 5 level. Now he’s doing it while not even being a top 25 player in a fast paced league. You compare him to magic and Oscar, the big difference was those guys consistently led those teams to huge offensive heights, something Westbrook has never done by himself even as well as someone like harden.   The point is that Westbrook here is acting like this makes him a good player. It doesn’t, getting 10 rebounds doesn’t make you better than Damian lillard or kyrie Irving. Doesn’t even make you better than a guy like jrue who can be a difference maker defensively and space the floor. It might not even make you better than a guy like Fred van vleet.   Getting triple doubles when you use most of your teams possessions and are horribly inefficient isn’t that impressive."
He will definitely get some all star appearances. I see Damian Lillard level potential for him
"I hate to entertain this post but you forgot Colin Sexton. He was selected with one of Nets picks. To go back even further, we traded the 6th pick for Gerald Wallace. 6th pick turned into Damian Lillard.   So really its:  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, and Colin Sexton"
What are your thoughts on Damian Lillard?
"Nah, I like RoCo - Damian Lillard"
"Believe it or not teams who rely heavily on one player don't always have the luxury of sitting their guys. Because when they do, we lose. Obviously were losing anyway, but that's beside the point   Again, Damian Lillard and Harden **literally have the same injury**... Except Dame only sat out 3 games, and Hardens been out for weeks. It's a playable injury, but good teams have the luxury of dropping some games. Blazers will fall out of the playoffs entirely if Dame sits to fully heal.   And he had two separate injuries. You can look it up yourself. He injured his knee without about 3 minutes left on 3/19 against the Mavs. You can Google it for yourself. He then was mediocre, and suffered a hamstring injury a few games later. He tried to play through it but was awful, so he sat out those 3 games to try and get right - clearly it didn't work  Go look at his game log.   He was playing amazingly - best of his entire career - and then instantly fell off after that injury  You don't go from 31/8 on 63% TS% for 40 games to 22/7 on 53% TS% out of nowhere without an injury. That's way more than a slump. If you'd actually watch him, you'd know. He looks slow as fuck. He can't create any separation, his jumpers are all short, and he's shooting under 50% from &lt;5 feet. That's not Dame."
"He wasn't remotely close to Jokic's positive impact on the court.  He is already a better player than Murray was before his Acl however.  That isn't a knock on Murray - a switchable oversized wing with 95th percentile scoring efficiency is more valuable than any point guard other than Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard.  Its just the way the position's work."
"NAW HOOOLD ON A MINETT.  ARE YEW TELLIN ME THAT DAMIAN DAME TIEYEM LILLARD, GOT HURT AND HE CANNOT SHOOT THE THREE BALL ANYMORE?"
Remember when dumb fuck Mavericks fans pretended that Luka Doncic suddenly became Damian Lillard from three lmaoooo
"Damian lillard has basically been swept in 3 of the last 4 years in the first round. Except last year he did manage to get one game against the lakers. And jrue holiday for most of his time on the Pelicans was definitely not better than cj has been for the Trail Blazers. Anyone saying AD just straight up doesn’t know basketball. Damian lillard is seriously one of the absolute worst defenders in the nba. Just look up his 5 year rapm for the past 5 years. Meanwhile AD is easily a top 10 defensive player. Dame is better offensively, but AD is still really good on offense.   Damian lillard is clearly the odd man out here and the only other even possible one to debate is Luka doncic."
And Damian lillard actually played like complete shit and was not even close to being the best player on his own team that series.
AD actually swept Damian lillard in the playoffs a few years ago. And AD for most years had a comically bad supporting cast. Lillard has at least had Aldridge or CJ for most of his time there
It's time to be concerned about ~~Steph Curry~~ Damian Lillard
Damian “Denzel Valentine” Lillard
"You do know that shots over 30+ ft are uncommon even for a player like Damian Lillard right? From 2015 to 2019, Dame hit 37 shots from 30+ ft and that including the postseason. In that same stretch Dame hit over 1000 three's, yet people consistently say he has infinite range due to less than 50 shots made.  Saying that KD doesn't have infinite range is like saying MJ couldn't shoot because he didn't hit a billion three's, not only is factually inaccurate, but it's also dumb."
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).  KD."
"Uh, the fact that he's been diagnosed with multiple injuries?  Like he literally just game back last game after missing the previous 3 games with hamstring tendinopathy...the same thing that's had Harden out for weeks.  https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-plays-through-knee-pain-says-hes-just-dealing-stiffness-and  The bad streak started right after this injury right here. Look at his game log"
"Or ""trying to be Steph Curry/Damian Lillard"""
This guy *really* fucking hates Damian Lillard for some reason
"If Trae came into the league in any other context people would be freaking out about him and recognizing him as a historically great young player, but I guess it was decided with the Luka trade that he cannot ever be good   Remember last year when Trae by impact metrics was the worst defensive player to ever pick up a basketball and it was essentially 4v5 with him on the court so no amount of offensive impact could ever erase that?  But then this year Damian Lillard is worse, Kyrie Irving and Ja Morant are equally as bad, and everyone mysteriously forgot about all the defensive impact metrics?"
Damian “Rick Carver” Lillard
"&gt; Royce is a borderline all NBA defender he will do fine against LeBron. Obviously LeBron will get his because he is LeBron, but Royce is a very solid option.  He’ll probably average 35/10/10 if that’s the case.    &gt;AD will face Gobert when he comes anywhere near the paint.  Have you ever watched them play?  &gt;Whos guarding all of Utah's 40+% three point shooters?  The same players who guarded Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray last playoffs. Oh and the law of averages.  Did I mention they’re the #1 defense this season with LeBron and AD missing 40+ games combined?"
"True there has been a slight change in his Davidson form and his form now but I think it was more due to speeding up the release and ease for off the dribble shooting (I remember being curious about this a few years ago when I was changing my form but I'll have to confirm).   Also, there is a difference in understanding of what ""low release"" point is. I think Curry's release point isn't too low since he can get a range of shots off that a ""true"" low release point shooter (e.g. Trae Young, Ja Morant, Steve Nash) would not be able to get off. I mean come to think of it - does Damian Lillard truly have a release point higher than Curry? I wouldn't say so but Lillard isn't considered to have a low release point.  I state all this to say there's a lot of nuance to all this re: release point since it depends on whether the shooter is a one-form shooter or a two-form shooter (or even a 1.5 form shooter). Two form shooters tend to have high release point since they jump on their jumpers (Kobe, Ray Allen) and one motion shooters have lower release points since they don't jump much on their jumper (Curry, Harden). It is all pretty fascinating and your comment has me thinking once again about all the details that go into shooting."

First-game Fournier and any-game Grant are miserable to watch.  But at least we have Damian Lillard on steroids.

"I saw Damian Lillard at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

Damian Lillard tried to steal a bottle of Ciroc from my friend at a club in Vegas on my friends birthday.  So no.
"If he made that, Steph Curry and Damian Lillard would of practiced shooting that far"
Yup that's damian lillard... one of the flop gods
"I’d rather idiots didnt think Steph Curry or Damian Lillard was the MVP, yea"

"They should keep their core, i agree with you. The vet i’d like to see join the team is a strong playmaker who can drop 30. A Damian lillard or Russel Westbrook. Other than that, i see this team being a top three seed for the next few years. I see a long term rivalry between them and boston"

In the conversation in the same way Damian Lillard can be in the conversation. Won't happen but we can all talk and get mad about it.
Damian Lillard... love the man to death but 50 million a year for a 35 year old point guard??? gawd dam
"i was second hand disappointed and embarrassed when i saw that missed dunk (even tho it was lowkey really funny and it had me cackling). facu has been incredibly clutch this year and it’s all defence. we would have lost this game without him. he’s won us games with D before too, during that bulls game it was jamal who hit that wild shot to send it to OT but we wouldn’t even have a chance to shoot it if it wasn’t for a facu steal that forced a turnover and made it nuggets ball, shit, jamal even hit the first game tying shot off an assist from facu after a steal too. he annoys people, he forces guys to make mistakes, he put the clamps on *damian lillard* DURING DAME TIME. sorry i’m just remembering how great this guy is and any nuggets fan who thinks he shouldn’t be getting important minutes is smoking crack."
if we're talking purely about 3's Then Buddy Hield is a better 3 point shooter than Damian Lillard. Hield is a career .411 shooter with 2 seasons at .431 and .427 and 2 seasons with more total 3 pointers than Damian's best 3 point season.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_season.html
Damian Lillard averaged 45 a game over 8 games last season shooting 53% from three...

Sources tell me injuries have taken our Damian Lillard out of the MVP race :/
Yeah? Enjoy your 1st option flopping damian chokes once again.   Didn't you guys got swept in wcf with Durant out? With Dame shooting 37%?  Didn't McCollum carried hard in game 7 of wcsf? Damian Lillard with an absolute choke of game 7 shooting 3/17? If it wasn't for McCollum damian will get blasted hard or not cause you guys are blinded by Dame time.

"You don't know any Russ stans then. When he was on top they would harass the fuck out of Harden, Curry fans. Insult the hell out of anyone who didn't think that Russ was the best pg. Hell even that Portland series, Russ and his stans did nothing but disrespect tf out of Damian Lillard"
"Lol it's not even close to the Nets' level. It'd be more accurate if say, Lakers traded Caruso, Kuzma &amp; Danny green for Damian Lillard. And then picked up Paul Millsap, John Collins, and somehow acquired Seth Curry. And Clint Capela"
"I can cherrypick shit like that for days.  Damian Lillard hit 2 series winning buzzer beating shots in his career, Jordan hit 1, Lebron hit 0. Clearly Lillard is the most clutch player of all time.  Or better, John Wall hit a game winner vs the Celtics in Game 6 that one time. Surely he is a better clutch performer than Kobe Bryant, who missed that one game winning shot that one time in one of the seasons I picked."
"I'm sorry man, but the only way Ben Simmons finds his way to Portland is if Damian Lillard specifically requests a trade to Philadelphia. And if you're thinking about duos, then I guarantee an Embiid-Lillard duo is easily the most frightening combination in the league, even moreso than Ben-Dame."

bro damian lillard is straight up good at his job.
Damian Fucking Lillard is everything you want in a superstar.   He is not human
"I just want to point out that the Blazers have won two games this year when down by 3 without possession, with les than 5 seconds left on the clock. And Damian Lillard has the game winning three/free throws in each."
"Damian ""Plethora"" Lillard"
No mention of God or Jesus.  How refreshing. Damian Lillard is the real one.
"With his 12th 50 point game, Damian Lillard only trails Wilt Chamberlain for most 50 point games all time by... *checks stats*... 116. Nice."
"Damian Lillard, Mr."
we are very lucky to live in a time where Damian Lillard played in the NBA. The man is elite.
"""If you want to look good in front of thousands, you have to outwork thousands in front of nobody"" - Damian Lillard"
Man I love Damian Lillard
"Damian “saving Terry Stotts from actually making defensive adjustments” Lillard.   I love Dame, but I just wish he didn’t always have to bail us out. For once, a good clean victory would be nice."
"Dame went 18-18 from the line.  Here's a lesson for everyone:  DON'T FOUL DAMIAN LILLARD, IT'S NOT WORTH IT."
"I don't wanna take all the credit away from Damian Lillard, but I turned the game on when they were down 98-115 and thought, ""oh this would be a fun one to watch if portland came back"""
"the refs definitely do not love Damian Lillard, i promise u that."
Damian. Lillard.
Have any of your players considered being Damian Lillard?
Who would win? A well disciplined team moving the ball around and getting high efficiency looks or Damian Lillard??
"There is no point fouling Damian Lillard up 3 if there's 7+ seconds left and the other team still has a timeout.  Its a valid strategy when there's less time and no timeout because the opposition is forced to take a very bad shot. Here, even without the turnover, even if New Orleans hit both free throws, Dame would've had time to make a comfortable play. And there is always a higher chance Dame hits both his than anyone on New Orleans hitting both of theirs."
We played like absolute dogshit for about 85% of this game. The only reason we won is Damian Lillard. Idek anymore man
Damian Lillard is God.  Checkmate atheists
"If I could sum up Damian Lillard in a game, this would be it."
Terry Stotts does not deserve Damian Lillard.
Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard ... The best whistle in the league  Who else in the league gets that call?
Dunno who is gonna win but I just wanna say that Damian Lillard is my real father
"Watching a bit more of their games recently, I doubt it has anything to do with Damian Lillard that the defense is that bad. There’s been plenty of teams that have had meh defensive rosters with clear liabilities playing 30+ minutes a game and still being a top 5-10 defense. It seems like a schematic failure where they apply too much pressure in the middle and allow wide open corner 3s on half of their possessions on purpose. I think they could use a coaching change"
"I'll come at this from an ownership perspective and not a GM perspective because my main sport is the NFL. I watch full Blazer games and highlights from the other top teams, so I'm not that educated to come at this from a reddit GM aspect.  I'll start with saying that the Blazers success over the last 5 seasons is due soley to Damian Lillard. Not the GM, not the coach, not the organization. If we don't have Dame, then we are a bottom 5-10 team in the league. Full stop.  Honestly, I love Terry, but he's gotta go. Olshey did really well last season and changed my opinion on whether he needs to go for now, but 1 really good offseason doesn't change that he's done a pretty mediocre (at best) job before that.  If I was Jody Allen, I would not hesitate to over spend for a good GM and good coach who normally wouldn't be interested in a smaller market. The Allen family is one of the most wealthy team owners in the NBA. Spend a few extra 0's to get an experienced and successful GM. Pay whatever it takes to get the coach that GM wants. Pay whatever you need to pay so that the organization is ran like a top 5 organization from the top down."
"That actually makes it more appealing.  He'll also be a trivia question in the annals of NBA history forever.  And yeah following Arenas was really fun at the time - to me, he's the answer to the question ""what if Damian Lillard was a headcase who didnt care about team basketball?"""
"OP is making a specific argument that Curry's on/offs make this season historically great (even, presumably, compared to past seasons by Curry himself), based on his on/off splits. Nobody's arguing that Curry isn't an exceptional player, but the on/offs (which would already be high in any circumstances, because Curry is very good and nobody else on the Warriors is nearly as good) are being exacerbated by Kerr's rotations in a way that simply isn't true for most other stars in the NBA, particularly two of the players who Curry draws the most comparisons with (Damian Lillard and LeBron James), who have staggered minutes significantly with their team's 2nd best players over the last year and a half, depressing their on/off splits.   The fact that Kerr plays Draymond exclusively next to Curry while Stotts frequently plays CJ away from Lillard doesn't, by itself, say anything about the capabilities of Curry or Lillard themselves (and no, I'm not arguing that Lillard is better than Curry, just shooting down the idea of the on/offs being informative about that one way or the other). That's more about the specific skillsets of Draymond and CJ than anything else. If the two were traded the Blazers would run Draymond next to Lillard as much as possible and the Dubs would have CJ run their 2nd unit."
Ahhh 1x ROTY Damian Lillard is better no doubt
Damian Lillard in shambles
They've never played basketball in their lives and the commentators and Damian Lillard definitely didn't help things.
Damian Lillard  Demar Derozan  Kawhi Leonard  KG  Dwight Howard
"And [Damian Lillard](https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard/status/1371661720112951302) not knowing the rules fueled it, further."
Damian Lillard. Boring af. The most exciting player to watch is LAMELO BALLLLLLLLL
"Lol maybe you’re watching different games than me. The last year we played the Warriors, we had Enes Kanter with a dislocated shoulder as our starting center and Damian Lillard fucked his ribs up in game two, plus we had just played a very exhausting 7 game series, while the rockets just rolled over for the Warriors."

"In no particular order:  1.	Lebron 2.	KD 3.	Harden 4.	Kawhi 5.	Giannis 6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Joel Embid 8.	Steph Curry 9.	Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Paul George 12. Chris Paul 13. Luka Doncic 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Not sure if I missed anyone, but are all better and most are a tier above Tatum. Tatum is solidly in 16-20."
Was a bit overlooked ? Maybe like a Damian lillard (6th overall pick vs steph being 7th)
Damian Lillard Bradley Beal CP3
Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Jokic
"Damian Lillard - he’s just so fun to watch and it’s hard not to like his personality. Feel like the only people who hate him are OKC fans  Jimmy Butler - he has the personality of all the great pistons players, would fit right in with the bad boys or going to work piston. Of all players in the league he’s who ive wanted on my team for years.  Carmelo - he shoulda been a piston from the start. I want him to get a ring so bad. The way he scores is always fun to watch and I’m happy he’s had this resurgence in Portland after, wrongly, being blamed for how Houston and OKC performed when he was there.  Honorable mention - Cp3. Same with Melo in needing a ring. He instantly elevates any team he’s on, just a point god"
"LeBron - loved him since I started watching basketball, that only got better when he joined the Heat. Since he's left my second favorite team in the league has been ""LeBron's team""  Damian Lillard - absolutely electric player to watch, one of the most clutch players I've ever seen, and I like his style of offense a lot  Josh Richardson - Love his approach to the game, is a great teammate, and will try to excel in whatever role he's given on a team. Would love to have him back in Miami down the line"
"Damian Lillard because I live in Portland and get to watch him do magical shit on the regular.  De'Aaron Fox because he's lefty, fast as fuck and gets after it.  And Jokic because how can you not love seeing a guy that's 2 donuts away from being pudgy obliterate the league with a bunch of pick-up-at-the-YMCA moves?"
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
Damian Lillard.   I feel like he is one of the most clutch players late in the 4th. Never complains about his team or trying to get on a super team.  Shout out to Tyson Chandler as well. Loved him on the Mavs and the Knicks. Also only player from another team I have the Jersey for at the moment.

&gt; Yes the team who shot almost twice as many free throws is the team that got blasted by the refs  if this is how you gauge whether the refs were biased then your argument is already null  that's like the worst cop out reasoning to try to prove that refs were on some shit  anyways though why the fuck would the refs ever want to help the minnesota timberwolves over the team with damian lillard? shit makes no sense
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
"Damian Lillard, he's awesome and has some crazy clutch moments"
Damian Lillard should go on this list too since his game isn't suited to handle playoff trapping defense but he has his moments of good play
Damian Lillard
"Yes he does and if you don't think so you are completely ignoring the era in which he played in and his absurdly complete skillset.  Kobe played 90% of his prime in the slowest era in NBA history (by pace) and played in a time pre-analytics. He also played in a transition period where handchecking and the physical aspects of the game were still allowed for a time.  Players that had their primes in the 2000s will always be underrated due to how inefficient the league was as whole, how little spacing the players had and how insanely slow the game was. That's why we have people that think Damian Lillard is a better scorer than Allen Iverson, when in reality if you actually knew what the hell you are talking about, you would know it's not even a debate.  Kobe averages virtually the same amount of points as KD, Harden and LeBron per 100 possessions while having played in an era without the crazy amount of spacing we have today and without all the freedom the players have with absolulely zero physicality to the game.   That's not even mentioning that he probably has an argument as the most skilled player of all time and KD himself said that him and Michael are Top 2."
"Allen Iverson and Damian Lillard have a higher scoring average than Larry Bird and both will end up with more points and 50 point games, neither are better scorers than Larry.  Averaging a bunch of points doesn't mean that you are a better scorer than someone, Karl Malone averaged more points than Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal and there isn't a soul on earth that thinks he is a better scorer.  LeBron wasn't for a second of his life a better scorer than Bird. He is a slightly better passer, an absurdly better defender and a superhuman athlete, but he wasn't even in his prime better than Bird at scoring the basketball and longevity stats won't change that.  LeBron is the greatest driver of the basketball ever, but Bird was a better shooter in any spot (midrange, 3-PT or FT) and ironically was the far better post player, despite not being 6-9 and 260 pounds.  But i will follow your logic, by PPG the 5 greatest scorers ever are MJ, Wilt, Elgin Baylor, KD and Jerry West then."

"Damian Lillard, still underrated"
TFW BLAZERS FINISH TOP EIGHT EVERY YEAR SINCE 2014 AND DAMIAN LILLARD HAS “NO PLAYOFFS EXPERIENCE”???????????
Damian Lillard
"Yikes...That's kinda why I brought my background story up, I feel like shooting was his true weakness and to not want to show up to a local trainer who played and trained with Damian Lillard, you really not trying to be great."
"Damian Lillard (yes, already. Walton played \~200 games for Portland and Drexler is a Rocket.)"
"Bill Walton or Clyde Drexler.  If Damian Lillard finishes out his career in Portland, regardless of whether he wins a championship or not, he is our greatest player."
"All time?  Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan  *(I started watching basketball in the 2000s)*  Current: Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid"
"Yeah, and they're all literally better than anyone on those Toronto teams that Bosh led.    Also Damian Lillard put up 20ppg, dont be disingenuous by relegating him to ""rookie lilliard"""
"Damian Lillard, CP3 for players currently in the league that are 6’2”. If you bump it up to 6’3 you can throw in Steph Curry and Bradly Beal too. There’s a lot of balling players now a days"
"So I agree with most people in this thread that it's generally a good thing with some qualifiers. Too often we lose games (like the last one to Portland) where we have a higher FG%, more assists, rebound better, and still lose because we got out-shot from distance. In fact this was the game that many analysts cite as a prime example of why Ben should win DPOY. Because he locked up Damian Lillard. And yet we still lost because they just made way more threes than us (and Prime Melo decided to show up randomly).   It's good because shooting the three is so much more important than anything else that if you win being out-shot by the margins the Sixers have it means you were doing most everything else very well. But it would be a *great* sign if they could upgrade their shooting at the deadline while maintaining (or enhancing) the areas of strength they already posses."
I don’t think a three point contest takes that much preparation especially for Damian Lillard

[FiveThirtyEight] We Know About Portland’s Prolific Damian Lillard. Can Its Much-Maligned Literally Everything Else Level Up?
"Perhaps I have worded this improperly but I can simplify it to make it easier to understand my argument  The difference between Lebron and Jordan is that Lebron willfully moved to organizations and set up with better players and better staff AFTER his drafted organization failed him for 7 years  Jordan had the luxury of being drafted to a team that had Jerry Krause to expertly build around him.  &gt; nor were the Bulls a superteam by any definition when both their best players were drafted and developed  Superteam definitions mean nothing to me. This is what I am arguing here:  &gt; Some of your favorite players now and in the future will be regarded as just 'good' players because they never got the right system/teammates that's just reality about legacy  If you leave the construction of your team up to the FO you were drafted by you could luck out and have Jerry Krause, Pat Riley, Jerry West, or Masai ect  Or you could be stuck on a team with no direction and no real chance to prove your worth like Damian Lillard is going through right now  Jordan's team was still a 'super team' it was just constructed by a competent FO. Horace Grant and Dennis Rodman were excellent #3 guys. Pippen was top 4 in MVP voting the year Jordan left, Phil Jackson is considered one of if not the best coaches. Jerry Krause put together excellent roleplayers to fill their line up with like BJ Armstrong, Bill Paxson, Steve Kerr.  Lebron should be judged for leaving a shit FO and finding a good one when Jordan lucked into having Jerry Krause?   It's a silly criticism"
"&gt;Dame taking shots off the dribble doesn’t instantly make them harder than Klay who is sprinting off a screen and taking off-balance bombs over a good contest.  Damian's also the first option on offense. Klay's efficiency plummets with Curry off the court, and it's not because he's as good as Damian at making tough 3s.      &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Sure, Harris might be taking more per game now  No he isn't, but Duncan Robinson did last season, with better 3PT%, without Curry/Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Additionally, Harris cannot score nearly the way Klay does.  Klay cannot score nearly the way Ray Allen/Zach Lavine/Damian Lillard/Larry Bird/Steve Nash and others do.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The Warriors are desperate for any offense and we got OP and a bunch of other randos acting like Klay wouldn’t be taking 10 threes per game.  Instead of assuming he maintains his elite efficiency with increased attention and 20% more 3 point attempts like you do?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;but this year is a whacky whacky stats year.  Doesn't explain the Ray Allen, Kyle Korver, J.J. Redick seasons.     &gt;This is full of fallacies.   Evidently not any more than yours."
Prolific offense reaches an ORTG of 92.3 this playoffs without Damian Lillard on the floor lmao
Wow sounds exactly like Damian Lillard
"If that player were Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons, Giannis or Bam Adebayo I'd give them a chance, if it has to be someone else from their roster that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.  Also the Celtics need a 6th player on offense, preferably Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic or Damian Lillard"
"Draymond too, that dude in 2016 was an anomaly. Dude was locking down Dame and Harden's incompetent supporting pieces and THEN matching Damian Lillard and James Harden's three point shooting when Steph went down"
If you listen quietly in the wind...just listen...and hear the chuckles of Damian Lillard.
Do you really want Damian Lillard and Paul George on the same team? After all their trash talk to each other?
1. James Harden  2. Steph Curry  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard
I wanna see Andre Drummond imitate Steph Curry and Damian Lillard while he is still in his prime
"You'd hope so. I don't know how they came into this game two, after looking so ready in game one, with such a lack of give a fuck.   Frankly, if we got moderate production from ANYONE outside of Dame this game would have been competitive. But Norman Powell is playing like trash, CJ kept coughing up the ball, Nurk was taken out of the game mentally by the refs long before he was physically taken out by the refs. The list goes on.   Just an all around dogshit performance for everyone not named Damian Lillard."

"&gt;If you actually believe that Dame can do everything that Isiah did, not only you are overvaluing shooting and completely ignoring the different rules in ballhandling, but you are also overlooking Isiah's passing, defense and leadership, which is what made him great in the first place.  Okay let's look at Isiah.  He had an all-time great defensive squad behind him. He had an all-time great coach leading him. He had rules that would have favored his physical defensive style.   &gt;Also, there's a reason why all of the all-time great post scorers existed before this era, players in the past focused in different skills, so they had different skillsets, who knew?  You're overvaluing post moves and undervaluing shooting but mentioning different eras have different skill sets...  &gt;Only in basketball people actually believe that humans get that much more skilled in 30 years, nobody in their right mind thinks that Matthew Stafford compares to John Elway because of stats, but NBA reddit have this obsession that shooting equates to more skill, which is asinine.  Stafford 100% is a better thrower than Elway.  Take prime Stafford and prime Elway, put them on an empty field and put targets out there. Stafford would be better.  The players now are bigger, faster, and stronger than ever before. This is true in practically every sport.  Kids are being farmed for sports in elementary school.  They should be technically more skilled.   &gt;Just because you are a better shooter than someone, it doesn't mean that you are more skilled or better.   It means you're a better and more skilled shooter. Shooting is more valued today because of analytics. Therefore, the ability to shoot is more important in today's game.  &gt;Damian Lillard is a better shooter than Allen Iverson, he is not better or more skilled than AI was and the same can be said in a comparison between Paul George and Dr. J, for example.  A.I. was a volume shooter which is not valued by today's analytics. Would he contribute as much to a team as he did in the 2000s? Maybe, maybe not.  The same can be said between Dr J and PG.  PGs skills are more useful in today's game.  I like how you aren't talking about absolute freaks of nature like the Greek Freak, Zion, LeBron, Durant, Joker, etc."

He might take the Nuggets matchup personally but he definitely doesn’t hate Jokic.    They said [some really nice things](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/jusuf-nurkic-says-nikola-jokic-deserves-mvp-if-damian-lillard-doesnt-win-it) about each other not even 2 weeks ago
Damian Lillard a kid lol
i love damian lillard&lt;3
"It looks like the ratio of good to bad calls for Jokic is almost exactly 1:1 here, what are you on about? In fact, it looks like Jokic has a more favourable ratio of calls for vs calls against than literally LeBron James does. Him being no. 1 in volume doesn't mean anything, it just means he's involved in a lot of end of game calls. His bad call ratio is absolutely not noteworthy compared to the average on that list  Ironically, this list shows Damian Lillard getting way more fucked over by refs lol. Half the amount of favourable calls as Jokic"
Damian Lillard is like the goddamn boogeyman in the best way.
"&gt; Plus a streaky scorer who isn't actually efficient.  Thoughts on one Damian Lillard?  He's marginally more efficient in the playoffs, a horrible defender, and also streaky in the playoffs (hello 2019 WCSF)"
Damian “despite the loss” Lillard
Robert Covington with a terrific 3/1/1 on 38 minutes played in a playoff game.   This franchise owes Damian Lillard a public apology.
you can look how many times he's shot above 56% (not 50%) right here:https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/6606/damian-lillard  (Hint: it's not even close to 10 times let alone 40)
It's absolutely mind-blowing just how horrendous everyone on the Blazers not named Damian Lillard is playing
Thread title is wrong. Corrected version:  Damian Lillard and 4 traffic cones @ Denver Nuggets
Damian Lillard and a bunch of bums Season 8
"Damian Lillard:  32 points, 9/15 from the field, 8/11 from 3  Rest of the Blazers:  29 points, 9/31 from the field, 4/11 from 3"
Damian Lillard has also tied Vince Carter with the playoff record for most threes in a half at 8.
What a battle between Damian Lillard and Nikolai Joekits
"Damian ""Doug McDermott"" Lillard"
it took damian lillard to make like 7 threes for mike malone to figure out to double him... these coaches are so fucking dumb... wish we had  some mathematicians or some shit coaching games lol
Who does Damian Lillard think he is? Bryn Forbes?
Damian. Fucking. Lillard.
Damian Lillard might be underrated at this point
Is damian lillard already the greatest trail blazer in history?
Damian Lillard scares and excites me.
I just watched the Blazers catch up from a 14pt deficit...because of Damian Lillard. fkn bananas
Damian. Lamonte. Ollie. Lillard. Sr.

DAMIAN LILLARD WTF
Known playoff choker Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard has one career triple double.
I think Donovan Mitchell will have a very Damian Lillard esque career in the NBA
"If damian lillard retired today, portland will retire his jersey and be inducted into the HOF. Don’t @ me"
For him this series so far is the equivalent of the 2017 first round when Damian Lillard became a pylon and was ungodly dogshit
Damian Lillard is fucking crazy
nah you're the type that would be telling everyone D'Angelo Russell is better than Damian Lillard if he was still on the Lakers lol.
"&gt; he only has a 41.9% on his career, and still chucks 7.0 attempts a game. Damian Lillard is 37.5% on 8.0 attempts a game... he is up to 10.5 attempts a game as of this season.   FWIW you expect 3P% to go down as 3PA go up.  Each additional 3PA/game is likely a harder shot (either harder to create an open look for yourself or your shot is defended better).  Klay being at 42% on 7.0 3PA/game is more impressive than Nash at 42.8% on 3.2 3PA/game because those extra 3.8 attempts are all likely to be tougher shots than what Nash was attempting.  Hard to say what Nash would do in the league today because he'd be training &amp; practicing differently, but if he had just blindly taken 3.8 more 3PA per game when he was playing then his 3P% would have certainly gone down."
"It IS a point guard and era thing. Steve Nash was arguably the greatest shooter in NBA history pre-Steph Curry, and he only took 3.2 3P attempts a game over his career despite a career 3P% of **42.8%!**  Think about how you perceive Klay Thompson's 3 point shooting... he only has a 41.9% on his career, and still chucks 7.0 attempts a game. Damian Lillard is 37.5% on 8.0 attempts a game... he is up to 10.5 attempts a game as of this season.  Steve Nash recently talked about him and D'Antoni's biggest regret from that Suns team was not making Nash shoot more, due to the era's expectations and restrictions put on point guards. Logically/mathematically the way to win with that team would be to force Nash to shoot 3-4 times as much as he did.  However, there were victims of subjective ""old school mentality"" social expectations of what a point guard should and shouldn't be. They kowtowed to that social pressure and opted for a less efficient gameplan."
Bryn “Steph “Damian “Trae Young” Lillard” Curry” Forbes helps too.
I would say a slightly taller Damian Lillard.
The shooters is the main thing. People don't realize how amazing this team is at shooting the ball now that everyone's healthy.   Our 8 man rotation is Nurkic/Kanter + 4 guys that are above 40% from 3.   The two that aren't? RoCo (38%).... And Damian Lillard (39%)  Our problems this season are mostly defensive + a lack of playmaking outside of Dame
"Dude, you can't play drop coverage against Damian fucking Lillard lmao. If you do, that's not on your guard."
You don't understand. He was always discriminated against and has never gotten a real chance. He would be basically Damian Lillard if the NBA wasn't that goddamn racist. He showed the world how great he is when he killed Jose Calderon.
Imagine doing this to Damian lillard or curry.. I think we could see 80
Damian Lillard
"&gt;gold standard   Right, but they're also new and clearly still have lots of flaws. Even the people that make it would tell you that. Gold standard frankly doesn't mean good lol. Give it another decade and it will be.  I'd go look at the actual data, but it's not free as far as I'm aware (but NBA.com does use synergy data for the PnR Ball handler stats I was talking about - says so on the website right at the top).  I know it uses video to track, but the problem comes with how you assign various plays.  There's a lot of subjectivity. How many passes away is no longer a PnR? Or what about [something like this?](https://streamable.com/6er5ms) I'd be willing to be this wasn't marked as a PnR play, even though the whole thing is entirely set up by Dame getting a screen, getting doubled, and then the Blazers just swinging.  &gt;It wasn’t you, the Jazz FYI you were second.  Right, we shot 43%...and we've been at 45% wide open with this iteration (essentially Powell in for DJJ who couldn't shoot). 45% --&gt; 50% frankly isn't outlier range. That's well within the realm of expected variance.  I mean, it's the modern era man. This Blazers 8 man roster is probably a top 5 shooting squad ever, yeah. That's not even hyperbole. A lot of the best shooting teams ever are the past 5 years. And only saying top 5 is being conservative. What other team had 4/8 guys be 40%, with the other 2 being 38% and 39% (Damian Lillard)  We just finished with the 2nd best ORTG of any team in NBA history (just 0.2 behind the Nets for #1 all time) and we've been the best in NBA history since the Powell trade. And then even better than that since we got healthy and cut down to our 8 man playoff rotation....which is why we suddenly started destroying teams (**124.5** ORTG)  Like seriously dude, go look at our recent games. Suddenly 19-40 isn't gonna look like an outlier at all.   Here's some shooting numbers from our last 12 games:  16-33 (49%)  20-40 (50%)  18-40 (45%)  17-41 (42%)    15-33 (46%)  16-36 (44%)  **20-35 (57%)**  18-43 (42%)  Again, I want to re-iterate. Those are all from just the last 12 games. Now ask yourself. Does 19-40 stand out? It's a little above average, sure. But outlier? No way."

"We shot 20-35 against the Pacers like 2 weeks ago dude. The current Blazers 8 man roster is Nurk + Kanter, then 4 guys who are above 40% from 3.  The two who arent? RoCo at 38%...and Damian fucking Lillard at 39% lol. You should expect us to be above 40% every game"

"The Warriors went with Steph Curry, who had never averaged 25 ppg in a season, Klay Thompson who has no ball handling skills, and Draymond Green who has the scoring potency of a donkey and won a championship and dominated the league. While getting rid of David Lee who was a very very good offensive player at the PF position. All by getting a new coach. The talent of the Warriors in 2015 and 2016 wasn't all that impressive. Guess what, the Duncan Spurs weren't all that talented either. Just coached well.  Yes, coaching schemes matter, considerably. A first round exit and pretender turned contender over one off-season and one coaching change.   Damian Lillard is the 2nd best deep range threat in the league today. And since when have you ever seen him run around screens or pin downs? The Blazers offense is literally to just work through Damian. Didn't work then. Still won't work now when they go up against strong defensive teams.   Didn't work for the Warriors in 2014.  Never worked for James Harden.  Didn't work for Russ.  Didn't work for MJ until Phil Jackson was hired."

"&gt;\[Post Game Thread\] The Portland Trail Blazers defeat the Denver Nuggets by 123 - 109 to take a 1-0 series lead, behind 34 points and 13 assists from Damian Lillard  No doubt 20 min is too much for Howard right now, I was just saying he might have some potential based on how he's looked. I just don't know where Denver is gonna find defense. More Millsap?"
dude no big ass center is locking up damian lillard. the reason he looked so bad on defense is because everyone on the other team can get to the rim way too easily because no one on the nuggets plays defense besides facu and gordon

I love Campazzo but there is a 0% chance he locks Damian Lillard up
"A couple years ago he gave himself the nickname “playoff p” which was very funny at the time because that nickname sound trash and he infamously lost in the playoffs with a game winning Damian Lillard three in his face. Last year he choked spectacularly, so social media mocked him calling him “playoff pee” and “pandemic p”. He also has funny quotes like “ that’s a bad shot”"

"It's technically valid, but it's stupid.   You could say that Damian Lillard got ratioed in the battle for the scoring title because the ratio of Lillard's points scored to Steph Curry's points scored is less than 1, but that would be a tortured, dumb use of the word. In almost any context you would say Curry just scored more points than Lillard, unless you 1) didn't know what the word ""ratio"" meant, or 2) just really wanted to use the idea of a ratio somehow and didn't care that there was a much more straightforward way of describing the relationship you were trying to describe.  And get this: note that you can use the term ""ratio"" because ""points scored by Lillard"" refers to a different, independent measurement from ""points scored by Curry.""  Just as I said."
"Exactly, Damian Lillard has always praised Draymond, but apparently random r/nba guys know more than Lillard about how good Draymond is."
May I introduce you to Mr. Damian Lillard
"here's the thing, we need to start talking about players in tiers rather than just arbitrary cut-offs at 5 or 10 players or whatever.  The reality is that there are more than 5 players in the NBA that have a top 3 or top 5 ceiling, and on any given night they might be there.  Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving aren't top 5 players in the NBA, but on any given night they can be the best player on the planet if that makes sense.  The differences between the elite guys in the top tiers of players are so marginal that you can make credible cases for them to be put in almost any order."
MVP: Pat Beverly   DPOY: Damian Lillard   MOY: Giannis   ROY: Robert Woodard II   MIP: Steph Curry
High-Tier Superstar - Lebron James   Low-Tier Superstar - Damian Lillard   Star - Donovan Mitchell  Rising Star - Anthony Edwards
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

Damian Lillard has MVP caliber performances every year. He is literally one of the most clutch players in history. It’s not whether he deserves it but which year should he get it
"Damian Lillard 19-20, Portland 35-39"
Damian Lillard is the most jerked off player in the league because he’s a good dude and chooses to live in Oregon
"ESPN: Damian Lillard calls Draymond the ""donkey of the day""."
"Yeah those numbers are pretty similar especially when you acknowledge the fact that Steph Curry is just naturally a better shooter than Damian Lillard. I'd like to say I'm on Damian Lillard side on this one oh, if you're going to not let someone be the MVP because their team is an ace you can't let someone else be the MVP if their team is an 8tg and their numbers are fairly similar"
"I don't remember any incidents from Blazers fans from 2019 like I do for Denver [fans](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/05/02/enes-kanter-nuggets-fans-turkey-criticizes-hurtful-denver-recep-tayyip-erdogan-trail-blazers/) and [commentators](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-jusuf-nurkic-blazers-nuggets-radio-021533406.html). However, if there were, please enlighten me -- I know we get into our little walled gardens and might not see them, or they might just get downvoted to oblivion in our own subs.  (I don't really count Reddit interactions in this because Reddit is just toxic all around on both sides.)"
"This is just such insane cherry picking at this point. Harden played a perfectly fine series against the thunder and lost to a much better team. It was his first year, his team had been a lottery team and games were that saying he choked in his team won anyways. So I guess he must have played really well in games his team lost.   We’re really going through his whole career and finding ever game ever that he played poorly in, even if the series was completely unwinable. I can do this with every single player who’s ever played. I can do it with Kobe. Go back to his suns series when his team sucked lol. Even when he had a good team he still had horrid playoff performances. I can definitely do it with kd. All super star players have bad games in the playoffs. Damian lillard just got fucked up by the lower seed pelicans a few years ago. Even clutch Damian lillard has had an insane amount of terrible playoff performances.   You are completely ignoring all of the great things harden has done. It’s so sad how incapable you are of rational thought"
What if he has a historic performance but the Bucks still lose (like Damian Lillard in Game 5 against the Nuggets)?
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
"&gt; He shot 44% from the field, averaged almost 5 turnovers a game, and entirely shot them out of games.  Well he's a guard so, naturally, his FG% will be lower due to more outside attempts. Damian Lillard (who you brought up) shot 45% for comparison. You just cherry-picked stats....... He obviously had some bad shooting games but no need for a hyperbole. Your entire point consists of cherry-picking two stats and ignoring his historic run at the end to secure a playoff spot.   &gt;If you watched the season, there is straight up no argument for Westbrook over curry, gannis, luka, cp3, Lillard, kawhi (left out Jokic and emiid since they were top2). Even guys like Butler, Randle, and Gobert had much better arguments.  Curry didn't make the playoffs. Easy argument. Giannis/Kawhi/CP3 had a much better supporting cast and WB had a bigger individual impact to his team winning.  Gobert is defensive anchor but in no way has MVP-level impact. He doesn't even have the best case for MVP on his own team."
That's Damian Lillard in 76ers jersey
Change my mind: Damian Lillard and Donovan Mitchell aren't good enough to be a number one option for a championship team
"Bens great, and doesnt get the respect he deserves... BUT were talking about Damian Lillard."
"A Suns fan should know better when it comes to narratives. If Giannis had Damian Lillard as the second star on his team in 2018, he would have at least made 2 finals appearances by now, possibly winning the championship in 2019."
"No, Sixers fans, you are not going to get Damian Lillard with a trade package surrounding Ben Simmons lol"
Damian Lillard CLOWNS and DISSES Ben Simmons and Giannis Antetokounmpo in SHOCKING fashion
What about Damian Lillard lol
"But imagine if he was a second option. A second option to, I don't know, let's just pick someone random, someone like... Damian Lillard? 🤔🤔"
Damian Lillard
"&gt; A trio of Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George on the Los Angeles Clippers would be absolutely insane  While true, we don't have much in terms of assets. Portland would get Paul George in the deal. But our exact team right now with Dame instead of PG is still something to salivate over."
1. Jokic 2. Embiid 3. Giannis 4. Kawhi 5. Chris Paul 6. Luka Doncic 7. Damian Lillard  8. Steph Curry 9. LeBron James 10. Trae Young  •Julius Randle’s poor playoff performance had him missing the cut
DAMIAN LILLARD
"Pure point guard just refers to a true playmaker.  Somebody who is looking to get everybody invoked and make plays for others most of the time, but can also get their own shot.  Somebody averaging above 7 assists per game is what I think.  CP3 is a 10 apg type of guy.  A non-traditional PG is Kyrie Irving or Damian Lillard who looks to score first and pass second.  CP3 looks to pass first and then he turns it on to score in crunch time in the 4th.  He’s not the teams main scoring threat all game, that would be Devin Booker."
"Idk what people expect. Any celebrity under a brand or corporation that has a market in China will always be silent on the issue. Whether it be LeBron, John Cena, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, or Damian Lillard. Even Daryl Morey stopped talking about it after the first tweet.   Similar thing happened to Mark Ruffalo when it comes to Palestine, since Disney doesn't want the Israel market to go sour   Best case scenario is if they give a 50/50 answer where they say it's hard for them to give a take on a situation that's ""complicated"". This is the unfortunate reality of putting profits above everything else"
"that's not at all what he said lol   he said he was against leaving portland to create a super team elsewhere, he would gladly welcome another star player to join him in portland however.  &gt; “If it’s a player that I felt like could help our team, I’d be like you should come to Portland,” Lillard said. “I would run it by them with that, but I’m not about to click up to where it’s damn near guaranteed win.” ^[source](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/heres-reason-damian-lillard-says-he-would-never-join-super-team)"
He seems like a Damian Lillard type guy who will stick with the bucks until worst comes to worst.
"I mean, I’d take current Holiday over Westbrook and probably in the last 3 years too, but any version of prime Westbrook from 2011-2017 &gt;&gt; any version of Jrue.   There’s a pretty big difference between a top 10 player in the league to a player who’s top 30 in the league. The equivalent difference today would be Damian Lillard vs. Jrue.    I guess Middleton doesn’t seem far off from 2012 Harden, but Harden in 2013 proved he was a top 10-15 player when given the reigns—which Middleton is not.    The oddsmakers slightly favored the 2012 Thunder over the Heatles.    Anyways, I think the 2012 OKC Thunder are a good margin better than this 2021 Bucks roster. I don’t know if I’d describe them as extremely close. The Bucks roster is very good, though. The 2012 OKC Thunder were just simply better. They ran through the West: sweeping the defending champion Mavericks, crushing the Lakers in 5, and beating an extremely good Spurs team in 6.    It’s the world #2, a top 12 player, and a top 25 player + DPOY-runner up Ibaka vs. a top 10 player, two top 25ish players, and Lopez (who’s very good in his own right).   The 2012 OKC Thunder were truly the definition and perhaps the pinnacle of a young super team. They just happened to run into a better and more experienced super team led by LeBron, Wade, and Bosh. Some folks at OKC’s FO were also just too dumb to see what they had in Harden. I also think it’s highly disappointing they failed to win even after Harden left, but shit happens."
Damian Lillard  Carmelo Anthony  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook   James Harden  Mike Conley  J.J. Redick  Derrick Rose  Paul George  Lou Williams   Paul Milsap  Demarcus Cousins
Yes a scenario where Milwaukee ends up with fucking Damian Lillard in addition to Giannis Antetokounmpo shows a deep hatred for small markets
"""Sad Damian Lillard noises"""
Dame is not a top tier player he needs to be a 2nd guy to win a chip  God forbid a team emerges broken enough to call prime Damian Lillard just its 3rd best player
"I love simmons....but its damian friccin lillard.  We'd have to give up all our young assets and multiple picks on top, not just simmons. It'd be maxey + thybulle + reed + joe (maxey and thybulle are the only two with real value there).  And we might have to still sweeten the deal with a trade of another player (maybe seth for derrick jones jr).  Without those young players and assets theres just no point for portland to do this trade otherwise.  Although to be fair, most trades i've seen seriously underrate lillard to my eye."
Damian Lillard is not better than Giannis this is recency bias
Ok guys you see Damian Lillard? Run at him.
"We've also never seen Damian Lillard play for a coach besides Terry Stotts. 9 years. I'm very curious to see what this team could look like if they shifted away from isoball (last in assists for basically the last 4 years running). Defense, we can only go up, right?   I'm also not saying this is the best team. But I think it's good enough to make the WCF. And that's okay right now. Perrennial top 2 team in the west, or top 4 team overall is okay."
Giannis is on his way to becoming Damian Lillard East unless he joins some superstar...
Sure.  Keep that up Damian Lillard East.
Giannis needs to think if he wants to be another Damian Lillard sending cryptic quotes at age 31 but by that time his athleticism will be on the down side. Draymond washed?  You must not have seen the dubs play.  Klay will be fine by next year's playoffs.   So I am not sure you understand leverage...  Giannis needs to choose wisely.. Curry is set with his legacy.

"Oh no... Chris Paul and Damian Lillard got hurt. Guess you're in the rotation now, Westbrook"
Do you think Trae is better than Lebron James or Damian Lillard?
&gt;Damian Lillard is believed to have strong interest  As if a needed another reason to love Lillard.

"Write a 500 word essay on how you'll fix a defense with Kanter, Anfernee Simons, CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard"
"Oh for sure. I didn't think this conversation was about reality. Just day dreaming.

Only possible way"
Damian lillard
*Future 76ers legend Damian Lillard
2011 LeBron makes 2021 LeBron look like Damian Lillard in terms of being generally liked
"Jesus Christ seriously, I mean thank you.. I really did have a minor stressful couple of days because of thee possibility of this. The idea of rooting for someone I respect as much on every level as Damian Lillard, to simultaneously have to root for Kidd was honestly distressing."
"the one, dominant reason they've never had trouble generating offense is because of Damian Lillard. Replace him with Ben Simmons and that team isn't a top 15 offensive team, regardless of McCollum being an efficient shooter (and little else). At the end of the day, Simmons creates as many problems for teams as they solve. If you're trading Dame, why get involved in that? Just take picks or young players that are easier to build around from some other team."
Kyrie being 10 above Damian Lillard is kind of absurd
TIER ONE  1. Kawhi Leonard  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. LeBron James  TIER TWO  5. James Harden  6. Luka Doncic  7. Giannis Atentokounmpo  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard
"My definition of superstar is that you can win a title with him as your best player and I think it should be strict. I won't call you a superstar until you have a ring in your resume.   For me the only superstars in the league right now are Lebron, KD, Curry, and Kawhi. Harden, Giannis, Luka, and Jokic are a championship away from entering that conversation, but need to win one first. I need to see it before I call you a superstar. Those 8 players are easily in the top 10 conversation though, and some would consider all 8 superstars. The question gets more interesting if it's simply a neat top 10, like would you consider Damian Lillard or Anthony Davis a superstar? Personally, I don't. But many do."
"Thats because Lebron is a 4x champand ATG (who, btw, definitely gets more criticism than Paul George, just not on reddit), and frankly Damian Lillard is simply a player that people actually like.  Not saying Paul deserves the amount of criticism he gets for his on court play, but it really isn't that hard to see why he gets more than some other stars."
&gt; The Mavericks outscored the Clippers by 7 points with Luka Doncic on the floor in this series.  Is that really an impressive amount? DFS outscored the Mavericks by 26 points and Dwight Powell by 10 points. On the flipside Reggie Jackson outscored the Mavs by 50 points. Damian Lillard was plus +27 in his losing performance.
I agree. Damian Lillard is much better than Anthony Davis. Much more effective too. Also Ad is way too fragile. His body gets hurt so easily sometimes he's soft
"Luka has 5 40-point playoff games. That’s more than:      Damian Lillard   Carmelo Anthony   Tracy McGrady   Kyrie Irving   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Vince Carter   Tim Duncan   Karl Malone         **Doncic has played only 13 career playoff games. The players above have played at least 50.**"
"By Steph? Sure. Steph will cook anybody. However, Rudy is one of the best iso defenders against guards in the league.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/  “For the 2020-21 season, opponent possessions featuring an isolation with Gobert as the primary defender have yielded 0.779 points per chance. That’s fourth-lowest in the NBA among 66 players who have defended at least 125 isolations, per Second Spectrum data, trailing only Draymond Green, Richaun Holmes and Julius Randle — and a big improvement from earlier in Gobert’s career.   A half-decade-old viral clip of Steph Curry turning a younger Gobert around off the dribble has shown remarkable staying power; once or twice a game, some unsuspecting young guard gets Gobert on a switch and assumes it’s easy pickings, only to be rudely awakened to the reality.  Smarter offenses eschew the iso against Gobert, generally in favor of attempting to stretch him out utilizing modern spacing and shooting themes. A ball-handler who can pull up for three, a stretch big man or even both simultaneously can force contortions away from the Jazz’s preferred drop-big defense.  He’s improved here too, though, both in terms of effectiveness and willingness. Today’s Gobert will often play up higher in pick and rolls against known pullup aficionados like Damian Lillard or Devin Booker — but he also has the mobility to recover all the way back to the rim and put out any fires this increased floor space creates.”  Your narrative is way outdated."
"The mavs can be a win now team, win now doesn’t include nurkic and CJ. If Damian lillard couldn’t win with them Luka Isn’t either"
"When did people start overrating Tatum this much (no offense)? It's like they only look at his 50 pt nights and nothing else. Sure he's a star, but reducing Damian Lillard to a ""31 year old"" and saying Tatum is on the same level as Giannis and Luka says a lot about how much your opinion is worth."
I propose moving both Lillard and Luka to a new city and starting a team from scratch. I'd flair up for the Damian Doncics.
Or Damian Lillard 2020/21?  &amp;#x200B;  Dame.
Everyone's saying congratulations Portland like I'm probably wrong but I feel like this means Damian Lillard is probably leaving. I know Jason kid probably wouldn't know shit about that but he'd probably be more into the room mill of current NBA players than others He's a sneaky bastard and I wouldn't doubt him having a foot in the door of information
PRAISE THE GODS!!!! Bullet dodged. Damian Lillard may have many different careers in the future but GM will not be one of them
"[Woj]: Damian Lillard has signed with Rich Paul of Klutch sports, per sources"
Consistency on the outside like Damian Lillard?
"But does this make Lillard happy? What if the next coach is not one that he vibes with. That will make for an upset Damian, leading to his departure in about 1 season."
"Damian Lillard: ""How cum he donut want us man?"""
"We in absolutely no way whatsoever stopped Damian Lillard other than in short spurts.  Booker isn't quite on that level, but Paul is a match up nightmare compared to CJ.   There is a reason the Suns are favored. We need Jokic to get hot from three and the midrange, which of course is a real possibility.  If he tries to bang with Ayton in the post all series he's going to get tired. Ayton is made out of granite."
Hahaha Dame. What happened to super teams being bad???   [https://www.si.com/nba/trailblazers/news/damian-lillard-never-join-superteam](https://www.si.com/nba/trailblazers/news/damian-lillard-never-join-superteam)  He's going to one like 5 months after making this statement.
Trae honestly might be a top 2 point guard in the league. Trae is going off against one of the best teams in the league in the second round. Damian lillard couldn’t even make it out of the first round against a depleted Denver team. Trae is also doing this against a top defensive team. Trae is a superstar.
he’s kinda like damian lillard but less consistent from deep but a much better passer. Lillard also finishes at the rim more while Young uses floaters and such. Game planning for them should be kinda similar

"&gt; Kidd was ultimately uncomfortable with the idea of pursuing the opening after Blazers star Damian Lillard publicly called for his hiring within hours of Stotts' departure on Friday night. The public nature of Lillard's endorsement -- telling Yahoo Sports that ""Jason Kidd is the guy I want"" -- left Kidd feeling he would put both Lillard and Portland's process in an awkward circumstance should he pursue the opening.  IT'S FUCK DAME FOREVER  I do think Kidd either knows something about how Portland is moving forward/has his eye on a different role but this sucks ass"
"According to Jason Quick and Shams Charania of The Athletic, a Clippers player spent the game taunting Damian Lillard for the team's coaching deficiencies. The player ""mocked that the Blazers didn’t have a coach who could adjust to the Clippers’ trapping defense on Lillard.""  Lillard finished the game with just 11 points  Wonder who lol"
"There is not a single reason to believe Damian Lillard is going to hit the downward slope of his prime anytime soon other than just arbitrarily assuming that Lillard being on the wrong side of thirty will automatically sap his powers year by year. Until something happens, like a serious injury, the expectation should be that he’ll play at a superstar level."
Damian Lillard 2022 rebounding champion here we go
Lonzo Ball  Kyle Lowry  Devonte Graham  John Wall (trade)  Kemba Walker (trade)  POSSIBLY Russell Westbrook (trade)  POSSIBLY Damian Lillard (trade)  POSSIBLY Derrick Rose (free agency)
Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum
That could never happen to Damian Lillard
Having Damian Lillard lead us to a decade of straight playoff appearances
The Magic don’t have Damian Lillard
"Same last name, different games, but the same thing happened to Gerald Wallace. Super physical player who Portland traded to the Nets at the perfect moment for the Nets’ first-round pick that became ... Damian Lillard. One of the most lopsided trades of the last decade as Wallace lost his spring from wear and tear and was done as an elite player."
"&gt;“All good things must come to an end”. An English Poet  &gt;In 2012, when I was hired as the Trail Blazers’ Head Coach, I could not have imagined the incredible ride this coaching journey would take. The extraordinary opportunity to be the Head Coach of the Blazers for the last nine years has been such an honor and privilege. It certainly has been far more than a “good thing”, and now it has come to an end.  &gt;There are SO many people to thank:  &gt;First and foremost, to the late Paul Allen and to Neil Olshey for giving me the opportunity to once again be an NBA Head Coach and for their partnership. Also, to Jody Allen for her trust and ongoing stewardship of this exceptional franchise.  &gt;Obviously, a special thank you must go to the Damian Lillard. These last nine years would not have been possible for me if it were not for the talent, leadership, and trust of Damian Lillard, a true MVP.  I am immensely proud of the culture Neil, Damian and I created with the Blazers.  &gt;THANK YOU RIP CITY fans! You are incredibly special and unique. The passion and love you have for your Blazers are second to none.  Every season, your support and overwhelming enthusiasm made Moda Center the most difficult arena for opponents and the best home court advantage in the NBA. I know of no more loyal fans than those of Blazer Nation. I cherished it and never took it for granted.  &gt;To the Players: Without a doubt, the NBA is a player’s league, and it is a team sport.  So, thank you to the 71 talented players who played for us these past 9 seasons. I have many fond memories of each team and every player.  &gt;To my coaching staffs:  I loved my coaching staffs through the years and thank them for their tireless work ethic, passion, and excellence. But mostly, I thank them for their friendship and humor. They made the work enjoyable, even when times were difficult. I often told them that our coaches’ meetings were the best part of my day.  &gt;To all the Blazer support staff, thank you! To everyone at the Practice Facility, Health and Performance, Basketball Operations, Media Relations, Social Media, and Blazers Broadcasting. They all do their jobs with such excellence and it was my honor working with them. A special thank you to our Athletic Trainer and Sommelier Geoff Clark, and my right-hand assistant Beth Hancock. Additionally, thank you to Chris McGowan and all the Blazers Business Operations at Moda Center.   &gt;Being the Head Coach of the Trail Blazers has been a life changing experience. There have been so many special memories that my wife, Jan, and I will always cherish; memories involving wonderful people and lasting friendships. We thoroughly enjoy living in Portland and all that Oregon has to offer. We are proud to call Portland home.  &gt;Thank you RIP CITY.  Stay safe and be well  &gt;The good times and memories will last forever.  &gt;Keep Portland Weird.  &gt;Terry and Jan Stotts"
I would gut the whole roster if I was the lakers to try to trade for Damian lillard.
Thirty two picks for Damian lillard lmao
No that's a big gamble for Damian Lillard
"Hindsight is 20/20. You can say the same thing about Boston. CJ looked better than Lillard in the first 20 games of this season before he got hurt. No one counts on injuries. And if you're going to trade Damian Lillard's best friend, CJ McCollum, you better replace him with someone much better on the court or Dame will easily want to leave Portland. CJ has more value than just on the court."
Terry Stotts won't have Damian Lillard in Orlando.
"Because he’s the most famous athlete in the world (outside of soccer) and the media has made him a divisive figure by overanalyzing everything he does or says. I just said that lol. Who gives a fuck what Damian Lillard for example, thinks or says because he’s not famous enough to generate enough outrage for the media to cover him in that way.   I’m also don’t have the energy to deconstruct the BS China thing today but it’s in my comment history and you can feel free to read why that was another example of you being spoon fed media shit and just eating it up because it confirms your biases"
"He's visibly upset in the clip, but they had just lost a soul crushing game.  Some disappointment is understandable.  He was just trying to answer the reporter's questions and get off of the stage.  The hate toward PG probably had more to do with how Dame reacted to the quote.  “For him to say that’s a bad shot, that’s just kind of being a poor sport. If anything, it was bad defense”  Dame took it as disrespect and I think that's when the narrative really got going in the wrong way for PG.  [source](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-paul-georges-bad-shot-comment-hes-kind-being-poor-sportif)"
"They had a bona fide superstar in Damian Lillard for all of those seasons. Now, you can argue it was also the front office's fault to a certain extent, but if you go to the Blazers subreddit, you'll find plentiful evidence Stotts was an extremely poor in-game coach, at making adjustments, and changing rotations."
"Portland Trail Blazers superstar Damian Lillard tells @YahooSports, after a year with Jason Kidd, his preference to be the next head coach of the franchise is not Jason Kidd: “[He’s] not the guy I want.”"

"&gt; Damian Lillard was their star and not Lebron, ignoring the canyon sized gap between the 2 players.  I take Dame at this point in their careers tbh"
I'd trade AD for Beal and assets or Damian Lillard. Probably would have to package AD with assets for Lillard though.
"You get swept by a Kd-less warriors team while running drop scheme against the greatest shooter in the world if you are an incompetent coach.   You get swept by a lackluster pelicans team because you can’t adjust to double teams if you are an incompetent coach.   You bench Nassir and djj because you don’t know how to use them in an offensive lineup if you are an incompetent coach.  Hell, did you see the article about the clippers player mocking dame during the game because Stotts couldn’t adjust their trapping scheme. It’s hilarious how you defend his coaching abilities because he got a team to the playoffs every year, something that is very much expected if you have one of the greatest scorers of all time in Damian Lillard."
We don't collectively agree. I have never seen the need to slander Damian Lillard.
"People have gone totally overboard with how they are overreacting to the loss. I saw someone literally say they were happy Damian Lillard was their star and not Lebron, ignoring the canyon sized gap between the 2 players.  Somehow him walking off the court, the occasional bad body language(it's undeniable that he's done this a few times now) and losing to the second seeded Suns with his second best teammate being injury prone this season has eclipsed his career accomplishments. I'm even seeing some nonsense about how he's ""arrogant and classless through his career"" and a tattoo he has makes all of the stupid takes people have had today justified."
Yeah this is definitely 2018-19 PG vs 2018-19 Damian Lillard. I’d go with Lillard.
"I was with you until you're saying CP3 isn't as good as Trae Young or Damian Lillard. Then, I was like ""oh he just probably means in the playoffs"" but you included Curry, who didn't make the playoffs. This comment is a real mixed bag.  What are you trying to say here?"
&gt;Blazers playing dangerous Damian Lillard game  I don't think Dame is Chauncey's type.
I even watched a recent video on how Damian Lillard 50 + point games should be considered legendary from a stat/usage pov but 3veryone completely slept on him.
"This is a trade that I think is fine:  GSW: Paul George  LAC: Damian Lillard  POR: Wiseman, Mann, GSW Picks  Feel like each team can have championship aspirations or a solid rebuilding trajectory with this. Your welcome NBA FOs"
"""THIS ISN'T WHAT I MEANT, NEIL.""  -Damian Lillard, probably"
"&gt;Beverley famously mocked Damian Lillard on Instagram with ""Cancun on 3"" jokes, insinuating that the Blazers were going to be an early out in the playoffs. Unfortunately for Beverley and the Clippers, they didn't go that much further either.   He brought it upon himself in the bubble lol, nothing for/against Cancun itself."
every team in the NBA hoping to land Blazers Damian Lillard
What? When this was first posted the first clip he had linked was the “Damian Lillard walking in” where Dame is hugging Wade and his son. But the post only mentioned Dame and Bron being at the game
"&gt;function getDame (team,wins){  &gt;if (wins&lt;=81){ &gt;console.log(`${team} is interested in trading for Damian Lillard`) &gt;}  &gt;}  There's a better/funnier thing here for sure but this is what every team is looking at RN."
"Every team: ""hoping to trade trash for Damian Lillard"""
${team} hoping for an opportunity to trade for Damian Lillard
The question now is Damian Lillard Klutch.
I really do hope damian lillard becomes available next season and we try to grab him... We need a proper centered human being as a pg
Damian Lillard
"Chris ""Damian Lillard"" Paul"
"&gt; The source told the Daily News that the Knicks are interested in packaging rising star RJ Barrett in a deal for a star guard, like Portland’s Damian Lillard or Washington’s Bradley Beal. If both the Trail Blazers and Wizards are uninterested in a deal, the source says the Knicks are also monitoring Cleveland’s Collin Sexton, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Charlotte’s Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.  Rozier is like 9 months younger than Beal."
the data that shows that damian lillard has been higher in mvp voting every year? cool
moe harkless/zach collins on AD vs jrue holiday on damian lillard. They dont even matchup so its not “completely outplaying”
"Nah Harkless was an important part of a consistent playoff team. Derrick Jones Jr can’t get minutes over Rondae Hollis Jefferson  I irrationally love Moe Harkless though so I’m probably not being objective  Olshey 100000% sucks though, I think he’s the worst GM in the league and has been saved by having Damian Lillard"
I didn’t realize Damian Lillard retired…
"Yeah, in the same sense that Devonte' Graham does the same things as Damian Lillard.  They both run PnR and chuck 3's."
"Actually, seems like PG13 tried to start all the shit.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2903713-damian-lillard-rivalry-with-paul-george-pat-beverley-has-been-brewing-for-years  Dame doesn't seem like the personality to ever start something, but he does like ending them."
"&gt; The window is closing on KD, Steph, Lebron, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard. The rise of guys like Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Young, Doncic, etc will eventually catch up.  Time do be like that."
Damian Lillard is pound for pound the most complete offensive weapon of all time and the Blazers are squandering his prime
"He gets this money for salary help in a trade for Damian Lillard next year, only reason I see him ever commanding that type of money."
"Damian Lillard is overrated. People act like he's a top 5 player in the league and a perennial playoff monster that is let down by garbage teammates every year, but if he's really that good then he should be getting more scrutiny. People are harder on guys like Giannis, Harden and PG who have better playoff stats and runs than him, and have had worse teams but performed better.   Dame is a fantastic player and when he gets hot he's incredible. But I've seen Oladipo do that before too, and I don't think Dame's peak has hit Melo's peak. Melo got crazy scrutiny but Dame kind of just skates right by."
Athletic as fuck and super skilled  Also he didn't shoot alot of 3s. Techincally in terms of TS Damian Lillard is over 6% more efficient than Michael ever was which is why its a bad stat to compare eras
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
The existence of Damian Lillard is definitive proof that clutch is a real thing
"When healthy, Paul George &gt; Damian Lillard"
"Idc how you justify it, dame is a superstar talent. You pair that with the MVP in jokic and you really have something.  Covington is a good 3/D guy too. Damian Lillard is one of those guys you just get if you have the chance"
"Tanking is not a way to winning any NBA titles, even if you draft well you then need to figure out how to trade and recruit other stars to the team.   This was a bizarre NBA season and we're never going to see one like this again. Injuries, going out with COVID, the favorites falling behind and losing, role players becoming heroes in lieu of stars going down. Enjoy this, one can not imagine how this current playoffs isn't a result of making players play so many games in such short time.   The window is closing on KD, Steph, Lebron, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard. The rise of guys like Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Young, Doncic, etc will eventually catch up.  Ben Simmons is a small ball 5.   Because Giannis can go to the basket consistently and make great plays in the paint which lead to scoring, He doesn't need a three pointer. Adding a consistent 3 pointer isn't gonna do as much as you hope it would because which guys actually going to respect it? the layup is still the most effective shot at the basket.  Giannis not being able to shoot free throws is an achilles heel, it's not only can he not shoot them but he even airballs them. Get that man shooting granny style, this is a bigger deal than not being able to shoot.  If Trae Young is indeed injured a bit at his ankle, the series is over. All that does is make it harder to go the basket and therefore easier for Jrue to guard you and score. That will be hard to overcome and I'm not sure it's possible."
okay. damian lillard wanted him. lebron was sad to see him go. giannis loved him.  he was the coach of two teams for what like 2-3 years? if a positive sentiment from 3 of the top nba player's isn't enough to make you think that players like him then I just don't know what to tell you.  we now have a top nine executive and a player's coach. time will tell but the narrative that players aren't going to want to play for kidd when there's nothing but contrary evidence is just inaccurate
I can't see Russell Westbrook anywhere but in Oklahoma City  I can't see James Harden anywhere but in Houston  I can't see Dwyane Wade anywhere but in Miami  I can't see Damian Lillard anywhere but in Portland
"I understand that, remember Lamarcus Aldridge said he wanted to be the best blazer of all time right before he left us the next season.  So I know words are meaningless, but that’s why I know for sure Damian Lillard is different. Not only his words but his actions too. He literally makes loyalty his number one priority even if it comes at personal costs. You can look back to HS and College, to his trainers, coaches, inner circle, hell even his girl is the same one since College. The dude is, and I quote “Loyal to the soil”"

&gt; It's Damian fucking Lillard. This vaults the Nuggets into clear cut favorites to make the finals.  They wouldn't do it for Harden and Harden is clear-cut better than Lillard is.
It's Damian fucking Lillard. This vaults the Nuggets into clear cut favorites to make the finals.  The Nuggets have an MVP in his prime. Hedging for the long term is insulting to by far the best player their franchise has ever had.
"I love Jaylen Brown very very much, but you significantly increase your chances of winning a championship in the next 2-3 years by trading for Damian Lillard.  Dame, Smart, Tatum, Horford, with a couple vet additions could absolutely be like this year's Suns and maybe win it all."
people dont understand how contracts work. A supermax for damian lillard is a fair deal but it isnt exactly team friendly.  Just because he is under contract for 4 years doesnt mean thats a good thing.
" &gt;getting put to toast by CJ McCollum, Damian Lillard  When did he play those guys in the playoffs exactly?   &gt;James Harden was obviously more impressive than Drummond and Whiteside. Definitely budd  Yeah lots of players have been more productive while getting burnt by Harden. He's one of the greatest offensive players of all time, he kills almost everyone. Hell he was scoring on a first team all defensive player with 1 working leg this season.  &gt;completely see where you're going with this.  I don't think you're seeing anything clearly."
"Oh yes bricks all over the floor, turnover troubles and getting put to toast by CJ McCollum, Damian Lillard and James Harden was obviously more impressive than Drummond and Whiteside. Definitely buddy, completely see where you're going with this."
Deandre “Steph “Damian “Trae “Rick Barry” Young” Lillard” Curry” Ayton
Neil Olshey hasn't added a single All-Star to the roster to play with Damian Lillard in nine years.   Somehow he has one of the longest tenures of any GM in the league anyway.
Between Cuban hiring former players and looking out for Delonte West and treating him like a Mav for life and helping him get the help he needed I wonder what it does for future free agent signings.   He has a Damian Lillard level of loyalty
Damian Lillard and literally every other superstar.
"You're 100% right. A new coach might win them an additional game in a series, but they need to change the lineup if they're going to get out of the Western conference. McCollum can ball. He's a great scorer, but I think he's the type of player that's most useful as a sixth man Lou Williams type of guy. Come off the bench and just get buckets.   In the starting lineup he just doesn't provide the defense or size to complement Dame. His off the ball movement isn't that great, and he frequently tries the score on an ISO. Dame is just better there, and so CJs skills are frequently undervalued.   The trail blazers need someone that can complement Damian Lillard and nurkic. At this point stay away from Ben simmons, but someone like that would be a much better fit."
&gt; Sixers fans should accept that the best possible move is finally holding Simmons accountable and addressing his offensive shortcomings unless a Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal type player forces their way out.
"&gt; Everyone is downplaying a guaranteed 4th overall pick - that doesn't get traded unless it's for a superstar since drafting one of the few ways to get a superstar on your team.  Damian Lillard is Damian Lillard but a number 4 pick could be anything, it could even be a worse version of Damian Lillard."
"The Knicks end up with Julius Randle and Damian Lillard and basically nothing else.  They really have no way to fill out the rest of the rost.  The Blazers don't exactly get fleeced here, but I wouldn't be shocked if they could get a better a deal than this."
I think Kuzma is an interesting paradigm in the league right now. Most people either think he’s outright Venezuelan league terrible or he can be traded for Damian Lillard straight up.  I’m more in the middle. He hasn’t quite developed as hoped for but he’s only two years removed from averaging 18PPG on a bad team. He’s basically been asked to just “fit in” with no real defined role on a championship team so it’s obvious he just enters games with no idea what he’s trying to do besides “play hard”. On a different team with less expectations and more offensive freedom? He can still be a good player. Remember he has excellent size for the “position-less NBA” culture shift and generally has a versatile offensive game. He’s on a very team friendly $13M/YR contract that would be attractive to a wide-array of teams.  He and a S+T of Schroder and a couple first round picks could net the Lakers a “second tier” star player. It’s not gonna get you Damian Lillard but could possibly net you someone like CJ McCollum if teams are desperate enough to blow it up.
"[Wojnarowski] Damian Lillard has requested a trade to the Detroit Pistons, per league sources. Story incoming.   why won't this just happen for fucks sake"
"You're dumb and making the rest of us look bad.  We will happily give the Blazers any and all players not named Joel Embiid, draft picks, coaching staff, etc. for Damian Lillard.  Morey will personally rent a 15 seat van and drive the entire team to the airport."
"""[Jason Kidd is the guy I want](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-on-portlands-head-coach-opening-jason-kidd-is-the-guy-i-want-043651102.html)"" is pretty definitive."
"Any rational Sixers fan knows that there are maybe a handful of moves that would actually make the Sixers better next year and a CJ for Simmons swap isn’t one of them. Sixers fans should accept that the best possible move is finally holding Simmons accountable and addressing his offensive shortcomings unless a Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal type player forces their way out. The only other possible moves I can see that would work would be something with the Spurs for Murray and a Sign and Traded DeRozen? Gives the Sixers a PG with solid defense and a closer in DeRozen, but only works if he wants to play in Philly. Could do something similar with Lowry but I would assume the Sixers would want more than just Lowry and Toronto has no reason to do that unless they think they can fix Simmons AND pair him next to Siakam."
"Even the Dame stuff he could search up ""Damian Lillard"" and find it... how tf does KD show up here"
&gt;Do you guys believe that the news of Chauncey's background search/clearing by the Blazers' front office will now convince Damian Lillard to stay?  You're the worst.
"The only time Olshey has ever improved a roster in his life is when he Forrest Gumped his way into a Chris Paul-for-spare-parts trade on the Clippers after ""basketball reasons.""  With the Blazers he inherited a 26yo All-Star PF and a rookie future superstar point guard along with two solid, versatile wings in Matthews and Batum. He ran with that core for three years, making only minor moves, then LMA dipped and since then it's been a who's-who of what random scraps he can add to the team next to Dame and CJ to scrape their way into the playoffs to get summarily executed the first time they faced a real contender, or, embarrassingly, the 2018 Pelicans. Amazingly, not only did it somehow work, but the fanbase got convinced that not getting those dogshit supporting casts through the buzzsaws of the dynasty Warriors or LeBron/AD Lakers was somehow purely the coach's fault so Olshey was able to scapegoat him and prevent any blame whatsoever from falling on himself.  He has not been able to add a single All-Star player to the roster to play with Damian Lillard, the best player in franchise history, in *nine years*. The only one is LaMarcus, who was already there and already a star before Olshey, and left the first chance he got. Zero All-Stars drafted, signed, or traded for in nine years. How many other GMs in the league have had such an incredible run of ineptitude and yet still somehow hold on to their jobs indefinitely?  (and before someone points out that Olshey drafted Lillard himself, he really didn't. Interim GM Chad Buchanan traded for the #6 pick at the deadline, scouted Lillard, and penciled him in as the pick before Olshey got hired the week of the draft -- Olshey acknowledged that as Clippers GM he had not done any scouting on Lillard at all until arriving in Portland.)"
Apparently the late Terry Stotts regularly offered to “grease Damian Lillard’s tires” and Lillard is upset this wasn’t a key decision factor in the new coaching hire.
"The best time to trade Jaylen Brown was a year ago when James Harden was available.  The second best time to trade Jaylen Brown is today, for Damian Lillard."
"Olshey managed to bifurcate the blazers fanbase, permanently.  His next trick, given his track record, will probably be bifurcating the Portland Trailblazers from Damian Lillard.  Is there anything this man can't bifurcate?"
"Give it till Next month before Woj drops a major bomb and announces that the Heat are sending Bam, Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Nunn and like 5 future first Rounders in exchange for Damian Lillard and Nurkic"
Damian Lillard is not Steph Curry lmfao
"A couple of the names you listed are absolutely good enough to be the first option on a championship team, they just haven’t been due to injury or weak supporting cast or both. Like Damian Lillard and CP3 (in his prime) are both good enough players to be the first option on a championship team, they just weren’t due to the circumstances I listed above. You also listed PG and Tatum, both of whom I would classify as coming close considering they’re both players who have led their team to the Conference Finals multiple times."
Free Damian Lillard!     http://chng.it/wsyJvbZZ7W
Give Damian Lillard a healthy Anthony Davis and he would be a Finals MVP.
"Yeah I’m confused, according to this his contract is up   https://www.spotrac.com/nba/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-10814/  Edit: he signed an extension for 4 more years"
"Look after this season, just trade Chris Paul for Damian Lillard. We'll even throw in Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky."
"As a TRUE Portland Trail Blazers fan, I speak for ALL of us when I say that it’s time for us to TRADE Damian Lillard. He can’t get it done. We need a true winner.    Trade Dame to Chicago for LAURI MARKKANEN: a proven winner in college and the pros. BYE BYE LAME TIME!"

Never would've thought I'd see a Harambe reference in 2021 while in the middle of a Damian Lillard possible trade request thread.
He just missed the entire playoffs to a torn ligament in his wrist. He has knee issues that held him out of games the last couple seasons. What am I missing? Jaylen Brown gets injured more  than Damian Lillard.
Jaylen brown may not ever be as good as damian Lillard is right now but damian Lillard might not be as good as Jaylen brown in 2022. Small guards fall off fast.
If Ainge didn't trade Brown for Harden then he's a dipshit or he knew that Harden would just opt out as soon as possible or whatever. Also he's gone and Zarren/Stevens are in charge now. Jaylen Brown will never be as good as  Damian Lillard and Lillard has no opt-outs until 2024-25.

You have zero idea how basketball fans react towards Damian Lillard if you actually think that
&gt;have become major factors that could force Damian Lillard to request out  Enlighten me? I honestly don’t know how else to interpret this sentence other than Dame considering a trade request. Maybe you’re seeing something I’m not lol
"yes, tht and a pick is clearly enough for damian lillard"
"Damian Lillard would make the Celtics instant contenders. Also who the fuck cares he's 31, he's Damian Lillard. He will better than whatever player Jaylen Brown will turn into"
"yup, i've always laughed off any notion of Dame wanting out, including his cryptic tweets and everything, but an article from Haynes is where it gets real. I'm hoping the wording of ""*could* force Damian Lillard out"" still means it's nothing though"
Expectation: get rid of CJ McCollum   Reality: trade Damian Lillard  😂😂😂
"Kyle Kuzma, KCP, and a 2023 2nd for Damian Lillard."
ESPN: Is Damian Lillard an anti-masker
"The only reason I think this hits different is because of the timing. Right now, they are already reports out of Portland that Dame is getting [antsy with all the losing](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/blazers-antsy-star-damian-lillard-endorsing-dallas-mavs-management-moves-conspiracy-theory). I'm thinking this plus that is probably not a good thing."

Bad photoshop - Damian Lillard
he said damian lillard range
"Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook spent nine and twelve seasons with OKC, respectively. Bradley Beal has spent his entire career with Washington and he still wants to play for that shithole team. Damian Lillard has played with Portland for a decade thus far. Anthony Davis spent seven seasons with the Pelicans before demanding out. This whole shit is overblown."
Davion Mitchell has Dwayne Wade level athleticism paired with Damian Lillard range. He's going to be a future hall of famer.
"In no particular order and assuming that they keep the original 50.   Lebron James   Kobe Bryant   Tim Duncan   Steph Curry   Kevin Durant   Dirk Nowitzki   Kevin Garnett   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Kawhi Leonard   James Harden   Dwyane Wade   Chris Paul   Steve Nash   Jason Kidd   Russell Westbrook   Allen Iverson   Gary Payton   Paul Pierce   Dwight Howard   Tracy McGrady   Dominique Wilkins   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Damian Lillard   Bob MacAdoo"
"Damian Lillard texted CJ McCollum after the third or fourth brick with,""Jennifer"" Then, after the ninth brick, Lilliard texted McCollum: ""Philly""After the Trailblazers sent McCollum to the 76ers, Lilliard texted a Watch emoji."
"Damn, Damian Lillard is definitely staying after this"
"And is Damian Lillard, or harden last time I checked dame never been to the finals and exits early every year and is a shooter. Harden haven't been back since he was oh wait playing with westbrook. Don't say Injurys cause even westbrook was injured some years that's part of the game."
"Shitty example lol it’s just his name, it’s the equivalent of a dude getting drafted in 6 years who’s name is Damian, has probably been called Dame his entire life because his name is Damian and he’s a hooper. If Damian Lillard is old, washed, and plays 15 minutes a game on an irrelevant team and new Damian wins rookie of the year and has always been called Dame his whole life, it would be totally normal to call him Dame as well, imo."
"Beal really just another Damian Lillard if true, man's loyal asf. But fr tho the Wizards need to rebuild or hope their young talent becomes really good"
https://mobile.twitter.com/TrueHoop/status/1416031164100489231  That’s literally what he puts in the tweet. “Source: Blazers star Damian Lillard to request trade in the days to come.”  Sounds like a pretty definitive statement to me
Do you want a trade?  No.  What about now?  Still no.  If I didn't ask that you wouldn't not want to potentially not ask for a trade what would you say?  I... don't know?  Damian Lillard officially told me he wants out of Portland.
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
"did you read the actual story? All he’s doing is reporting about a conversation that happened.   “Indeed, that Wednesday it was Damian Lillard who complained most memorably. Sources say he told his national team friends that he thought the situation in Portland was getting worse. The next day was his birthday; he would turn 31. He told the group that he had meetings with his team coming up the day after that, and he was thinking about demanding a trade. He put percentages on it—75/25—which confused people. What did that mean? It meant he would listen to the team’s plans, and if he didn’t like what he heard, he would demand a trade. He estimated he was 25 percent likely to demand a trade that Friday. Whatever the number, some in the room tell TrueHoop they took it as the beginning of the end for Lillard and the Blazers.”"
"Because there's nothing to watch. It's just Stern/Silver saying ""The Blazers pick.... Damian Lillard"" for a couple hours.  I think the only exciting thing to happen at the draft in the past 30 years is Kings skipping on Luka. I didn't watch it live, but that is the only draft highlight I have ever seen."
&gt;	I ain’t fucking leaving!   -Damian Lillard probably
Ben Simmons you ain’t Damian Lillard
"Hey everyone, please be very careful about calling Abbot a liar. This “Damian Lillard” character is being very disrespectful to a man who has based his career on the truth."
"Worst case scenario: We only get Damian Lillard for Ben Simmons.  We at least should get CJ, Melo and the Blazers' cleaning staff in the deal"
It's wild that Damian Lillard will make 30x the amount of money as the reporter in his lifetime while also being a renowned superstar but still isn't considered privileged.

"&gt; From Jake Fischer's AMA just now: At this point, I firmly believe the Sixers are hoping to use him in a package to land Damian Lillard, but that of course is a lot of moving parts. Daryl is doing a good job of driving up his value."
I love Damian Lillard. Hes getting a statue outside the Rose Garden rings or not.
"It's so hard to call, but I believe the Sixers' top goal is to use Simmons in a trade that brings back Damian Lillard."
Do you think the Blazers are going to try and move Damian Lillard before the deadline of next season?

I mean he didn't but he deserved to. You saying Damian Lillard wasn't an all star level player when he was getting snubbed from the ASG?
"I'd still go with Bron tbh. Winning a title in the next 2 years with him sounds very doable, there are 2 insane playoff runs left in him. He's also easy to build around. Both KD and Steph require a premier playmaker around them to excel since they are really strong off-ball with all the gravity and mismatches. KD is really crazy once he plays next to Russ, Dray, Curry, Harden. Similarly Steph is at his best when Dray initiates the offense.  I'll say that all of these are seriously great options and my decision is gut-feeling as well as the notion that Bron would in extremes require the least amount of talent around him to get to the finals because he can be all on-ball 90% of the time.   If you give Bron AD like in reality I think that's a terrific duo that would beat Curry's and KDs squad if they only get one All-Star as well. In contrast to LeBrons image he only needs one great player on the squad and not a Big 3 to win. You could also pair Bron with Damian Lillard, Jokic, Giannis, Luka/Harden, Embiid. Bron as the PG or PF with another _great_ player is championship ready. Plus the defense will be stifling with AD or Giannis or Embiid. Those 3 especially would dominate smallball lineups, both lineups Steph and KD produce the best.  So I feel Bron still has the best versatility and defensive upside. I think a lot of people would be surprised how dominant the Lakers could have been this year if AD wasn't crippled and LeBron hadn't re-injured his ankle. They'll be back in the finals next season imo. KD and Steph require more pieces to click into a chip squad, though KD and Luka/Harden or Steph and Luka/Harden would be equally crazy. It's just a gut feeling decision and my reasonings aren't to say that the other 2 couldn't easily assemble a championship squad around them."

Smh… Your point is that “Henry Abbott has no reason to put his reputation on the line when he has built a brand by not being a clickbait news breaker.” The links I shared are proving that Abbott is 100% pushing a clickbait narrative that is false. Your failure to understand this and see Abbots bullshit is exactly the reason why trash journalism exists. His incentive is to get clicks and he’s doing that by lying and trying to cover it under the guise of “sources”. Damian Lillard has spoken out multiple times saying this dude is wrong and yet people (including you) are still pushing the narrative.

I know right?! Clearly Dame is going to request a trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers to play with Cedi Osman... I believe Abbott over Dame because I think Abbott actually is Damian Lillard in disguise.
"Nets trade Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams, and a 2012 first-round pick (Damian Lillard) to Portland; Nets then send Wallace, Keith Bogans, Marshon Brooks, Kris Humphries, and three first-round picks to the Celtics for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jason Terry, and D.J. White."
Very little.  One is a Champion and a 3x MVP and one of the top 5 players at his position in history.  The other is Damian Lillard.
Pistons trade the acquisition rights to their draft pick to the Blazers in exchange for Damian Lillard.
"More like Damian Lillard overachieved. Also, we all know CP3 and Blake's injuries were huge in that series but yeah, I agree it led to a series of horrible moves from there. I'm still disappointed with the way he didn't even call Wes, one of the mot fan favorite die hard Blazers ever after the season and then didn't get anything in return for LMA. We basically lost all our assets and got nothing in return except our bench, and then the next year paid them insane contracts. Olshey is actually trash and he's going to be the reason Lillard leaves."

Damian Lillard vs the Nuggets game 5 (I think). Lillard taking them to double overtime. He was absolutely on fire!
Are you really tryna say Henry Abbott and Damian Lillard are both equally credible sources regarding what Damian Lillard is going to do?  “Tryna save face” fuck out of here with your conspiracy theories
"&gt; But having Damian Lillard &gt; having Bradley Beal especially when you factor in contract length.  I mean sure in a vacuum, but I’m not gonna be that upset if I got Beal instead. You’re making perfect the enemy of good"
"But having Damian Lillard &gt; having Bradley Beal especially when you factor in contract length.  Not trading for Bradley Beal and trading for Lillard or the next star who becomes available is taking a risk that you will be able to make that trade.  I'm not saying you wait for Wiseman and the two rookies to develop, I'm saying you wait for the right star to trade for."
"Honestly what have the Blazers seriously done to win since Aldridge left?    Damian Lillard put up all he could for Portland. Also, the examples you are giving I think don’t make any sense and are not applicable.    If Damian Lillard joins the Lakers what you are saying makes complete sense. But Damian Lillard joining the Celtics or 76ers he won’t be in a super team. It isn’t really the same as KD joining the warriors a team that was was just in the finals and they gave up nothing for him.    Teams aren’t loyal to players so why should players be loyal to teams?"
"That team needs to be a top 3 seed for that guy to win MVP. In the East, I think most people agree that unless some serious injuries to occur the Bucks, 76ers or the Nets are going to be the top 3 seeds. The only real wildcard is the 76ers with Ben Simmons trade possibilities and Joel Embiid injury history. So, there’s one potential spot open, and the most likely team is the Hawks sneaking in. So, Trae Young can be that dark horse MVP in the East.  In the West it’s more interesting and the most likely dark horse MVP is coming from there. I think there are a couple of candidates like Devin Booker who could get a lot of serious consideration if the Suns finish as the Nr. 1 team; Paul George if the Clippers end as a top 3 seed without Kawhi.  And there are the “Are they really a dark horse if everyone knows them?” In Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. I think if the Lakers finish as a top 3 seed and we see Anthony Davis putting monster numbers without LeBron and carrying the team you could see a lot of buzz for MVP. Damian Lillard if he stays with the Blazers and they are a top 3 seed you could see a lot narrative in his favour for staying with the Blazers, being loyal and deserving MVP for guiding his team from the 6th seed to the 3rd seed in the Wild Wild West."
and why should we trust Henry Abbot over Damian Lillard. Literally didn’t know the guy existed till a week ago
"If you want team loyalty there's Damian Lillard and the Portland Trailblazers. He's arguably  the first player that pops up in my mind whenever I hear the word ""loyal"" in the NBA (mostly because he preaches it himself). Their history is also pretty respectable, they've had the Bill Walton days and their first ring, then moved on to the Clyde Drexler days, then the Oden - Aldridge - Roy days, and now the Damian Lillard era. Their social media team is good, they interact a lot with fans. Their organization is meh, their aim every season is to become a good playoff team with no championship aspirations (although now that Dame is demanding them to make moves for a championship). I would be really careful tho, there has been reports that Dame could want out of Portland so take that as you will.  Another team that screams loyalty is the Milwaukee Bucks. The history is composed of the Kareem days (one of the GOATs in basketball) winning their first championship, then to the Ray Allen days (late 90s to early 00s) and then to the Michael Redd era, then to the Brandon Jennings era. From then on, it has been downhill but their lives would change when they drafted their superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was once a Greek kid that came to America with literally nothing, and he was alone here, trying to carve a role here in the NBA. He has been through some absolute highs and lows with this Bucks team (at least from when he was a rookie up to now), and now he's one of the most beloved players in the league right now. They had 2 seasons of being contenders (one was where they kind of flopped after everyone expected them to win) and now he has carried the Bucks to its 2nd championship, along with Khris Middleton (another loyal guy who stuck with the Bucks together with Giannis) and Jrue Holiday (a guy they traded for). Their fan interaction is crazy, they have this running gag with player Bobby Portis where he's absolutely a fan favorite and they chant his name every game and stuff. They have a youtube channel where they show behind the scenes stuff (this is why i became a fan, i binged it all and they look so absolutely cool). Their org is also meh (but only recently they did good, they've done more sus moves like Kidd hiring and draft fuckups like DJ Wilson and Thon Maker).  Overall supporting these teams would be really fun especially the Bucks, since they all seem to be really chill."
"Look, that Toronto offer of FVV, OG and a future first isn't sexy but I think it's one of the best that the 76ers will get.  For all of Ben's faults offensively, he does two massively important things for the team: playmaking and guarding the opponent's best player.   The issue with trading Ben is that his value isn't enough to get a single star (or stars) that can do both of those effectively. Especially if they were able to get the hail-mary of Damian Lillard, they're still going to have a giant hole at small forward that can't be replaced easily.  Neither FVV or OG are stars, but they're definitely above-average starters who together provide the playmaking and defense that Ben provides. Hopefully together they provide more of an offensive punch than Ben does currently. I think Seth Curry would be traded since a backcourt with him and FVV is a little suspect.  But, a lineup of FVV/Thybulle/OG/Tobias/Embiid is nasty and would allow you to maximize Embiid. There's obviously a concern of not having a true second star next to Joel but I think we're all past the point of expecting that Simmons will get you another one in return.   I'm a little confused on why Toronto would try for this trade but if they're able to draft Suggs to replace FVV at the point then you're good to go."
Bc this is Ben Simmons not Damian Lillard.
"You kids on Reddit really have no respect for player’s game, god damn.   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/damian-lillard-winning-percentage-career  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/trae-young-career-win-percentage"
Future Milwaukee Buck Damian Lillard. It has been written.
Damian Lillard just posted the facepalm emoji to this article. Abbott has been refuted by Lillard twice now. I wouldnt trust this guy at all.
I think Damian Lillard will recover imo  He is a bit good at basketball
"Okay, what aspects does it help him? I agree that there's a reason that a longer wingspan is common in the NBA, and I agree that it is beneficial, I just don't think Damian Lillard specifically has benefited significantly from the fact that his wingspan is notably long for his height."
All I hope is that we get to see a fat Damian Lillard to the start the season 😂
"I could believe both scenarios where Detroit leaked this to raise the value of the pick, but also OKC offering and DET turning them down.   SGA is great, but he's up for a probable max extension. You lock yourself in with him and move up your timeline to compete. If you don't think SGA could turn into a superstar, I'd rather go with Cade. It could be the difference between having Damian Lillard or CJ McCollum. Both very good players on max contracts, but one is a All NBA vs an All-Star."
"Welcome to the Nets, Damian Lillard!"
"Blazers trade Damian Lillard for Jerami Grant and the first overall, then trade the first overall to OKC for SGA and the 6th pick."
"In 2012 it was clear Boogie was the future and that he just needed a shooter to complement him. And they had Bismarck Biyombo too.   They had the option to draft Damian Lillard, a kid who was literally from an hour away and who had the perfect skill set to complement Boogie and Biyombo.  But they went and drafted a PF in Thomas Robinson who was a bonafide bust.   They literally could have had Dame and Boogie and had a clear path to the future. It makes me mad just thinking about it."
So in your eyes Damian Lillard is the true GOAT
"Why would they need him? They have Damian ""8 assists per game"" Lillard and Keldon ""Big Body"" Johnson on the team. Surely they aren't missing Trae's playmaking in any way right?"
"Trae is extremely impressive but he’s more of a damian lillard type. He’ll peak as a top 10 player for sure but he will never be the best in the league. His defense is bottom of the barrel and it’s unlikely he’ll ever become even a neutral defensive player because he’s so small and unathletic, that alone will hold him back as the top players have always been elite on both ends of the floor or at the very least neutral in defense will being elite at every other aspect of the game. Trae’s defense will be an extreme liability against teams with guard oriented offenses like the Nets or Celtics in the East. He was lucky to play front court teams in the playoffs like the sixers, Bucks, and knicks where his defensive liability is minimized with Capela’s impressive defense. Btw Capela has been incredible for the hawks, really impressive stuff.   This is what holds back Steph, except Steph isn’t even close to being as bad of a defender, while he is levels ahead of Trae as an offensive player. I doubt Trae’s offense will ever meet Steph’s peak because Steph’s efficiency and off ball presence is ridiculous. But even during Steph’s MVP seasons, he was not the best player, that title still belonged to LeBron.   Luka is different, he’s not a good defender, but he’s close to being neutral. He has the height and IQ to become a plus defender. Thus in all the advanced stats like RBPM, RAPTOR, LEBRON, he’s well ahead of Trae. He just doesn’t have a good team to help him win in the playoffs. He has the potential to be the best player in the league for his entire prime. And he has demonstrated that he doesn’t choke in the playoffs, he has that extra gear."
I think Damian Lillard and Roy Hibbert are in polar opposite states. Personally I think the Lakers need prayers so they acquire him.
I’m interested to see trade packages for Damian Lillard to the Pelicans because off the top of my head I can’t think of any
 Siakam: pacers  Lowry: pacers  Beal: Pacers  Derozan: pacers  Ben Simmons: sixers  Damian Lillard: Pacers
Damian Lillard is traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown
"They would beat a team with Curry on it. Everyone has to be solid on defense. Curry would be a swinging door and you can’t hide him. Not to mention you can hand and shoulder Check in FIBA 3x3.   I would replace Curry with Kawhi Leonard. Klay Thompson would be better in 3x3 than Curry  And I love Curry but his game is meant for NBA 5x5. He won’t have any space in 3x3. Guys like Kyrie, Trae, Damian Lillard and Chris Paul would also get exposed and do very very poorly in 3x3 too"
"No.  The rules are different and FIBA 3x3 is super fast paced. It’s non stop. There is no stoppage, no time outs. Those 40 year old retired players would have a heart attack after one game or tear an ACL or rupture an achilles   It’s also more physical. Hand checking is allowed. Even shoulder checking is not called. If a player has a weakness in their game, especially on defense, it will get exposed  If america wants to win gold in 3x3 in the Olympics, they’re going to need to send their best YOUNG players  Even then, guys like Steph Curry, Kyrie, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, etc would get EXPOSED. They’re not built for the 3x3 format. They would be complete liabilities on defense and they can’t be hidden. They would get hammered physically. James Harden and Chris Paul would have to ditch their foul-baiting and flopping ways since they wouldn’t get ANY calls  Lebron would adjust and adapt and do very well in 3x3. Kawhi Leonard would also be excellent. Kevin Durant might struggle with the physicality but the dude can still shoot over anyone so he would be a good pick up. John Wall would be great as well. So would Klay Thompson. Westbrook would be excellent…..except he has a super inconsistent outside shot and you have to be able to shoot in 3x3.   If America sends guys like 50 year olds like Stephen Jackson, Cuttino Mobley and Iso Joe, they’re not going to last, especially playing two games a day. They will absolutely tear something or get a heart attack"
"People *do* say those things about every other coach. It's about time they say them about popavich. His performance with Team USA should forever damage his legacy. The spurs are one thing, but you mess up America's team, and you're on the bad list.  Seriously, how are guys like Patty Mills and Evan Fournier dominating but freaking Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard Can't?"
"Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard are NBA players.  Keep your eyes out for them next season if you havent noticed them yet, theyre actually pretty solid prospects.  For real, Steph and Lebron said no, Harden/Kawhi/AD are hurt, this is the best they could do."
"No shit Sherlock is not the same as telling someone to shut the fuck up so stop with that.  You know it too.   And with the volunteer / obligation thing, this is a matter of opinion. You think volunteering obligates you go 100% and I don’t. Agree to disagree, but that doesn’t mean you’re right nor me.   I’ll counter, what would be better for the team: Damian lillard play at 75% effort or Seth curry at 100%? And don’t say guys like Westbrook cuz I guarantee he wouldn’t risk injury either. It’s no surprise that every player outside of jrue is not giving 100% effort."
"I was weary of it when I was typing it out but you have to keep in mind, this isn’t Whoes a better player, it’s who fits on team USA better. Damian lillard is a better NBA player than trae 100% no questions asked. But he’s a score first point guard who carries a team with his shooting. Trae is a solid scorer but a much more elite playmaker/passer. We see currently how the results are playing out with dame at point guard. Team USA has tons of scoring but no real playmakers. Is trae better than dame? No he’s not. Is he a better fit for Team USA as a starting point guard? Probably. There is potential to put dame at the 2 but I couldn’t put him over klay, as klay is the ideal 2"
"""they just different"" Damian Lillard probably"
I too would rather have the classy Rubio over players like Damian Lillard 🤢
You don’t know why ppl are high on *Damian Lillard*?
"More times than the amount of points that Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Zach LaVine and Jrue Holiday combined for today (47)."
"And to think Luka scored 20 more points than Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, and Damian Lillard combined for yesterday lol"
&gt;After trading a package around Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro for Damian Lillard in 2022   That ain't happening.
"Yes, when he called him Clampazzo in a thread about Damian Lillard"
Yeah they have scrubs like Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard instead smh
"He and Durant also have weird proportions -- super short torso, super long legs, long arms, narrow shoulders, small head. Gives them a wiry look. Someone like Damian Lillard is much more compactly built and thus ""looks"" thicker even though his weight is also surprisingly low."
Are we back to guys joining the team just thinking this will be a fun little vacation and they'll get a neat medal? Is it 2004 again?  The rest of the world has gotten **much** better in basketball. We should still win every fucking game by 20.  We've got Damian Lillard and Kevin fucking Durant out there. What the fuck is going on. What a joke.
"""You answered your own question mostly! All we need to do is replace Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard! Pretty easy spots to fill if you ask me!"""
I'm so confoundly perplexed in how so many lakers fans think they can land an all-star with Kuzma and KCP.  People on instagram be talking bout how THT and Kuzma is too high value to trade for Westbrook and they rather trade Kuzma and future picks for Damian Lillard. Like what are these people smoking?
"Their job is to make sure the Portland Trail Blazers win a ring, not Damian Lillard.  How does giving Dame away for a few weeks benefit the Blazers in winning a ring?"
"A lot of people wonder why Gobert wins defensive player of the year without as many flashy blocks or highlights, but by this stage in his career he has literally scared off teams from going in the paint, and you can see it whenever the Jazz are playing and they get forced outside to the perimeter. Players still go in the paint but if you are on the smaller side (ja morant Damian Lillard type) he easily blocks that, which prevents most US players from being able to do it"
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/team-usa-basketball-olympic-roster-damian-lillard-kevin-durant-among-final-12-man-squad-heading-to-tokyo/  Listed are the players who declined and the players listed as ""finalists"" who are undoubtedly better players and a better fit than Mcgee and Keldon Johnson."
"Yeah, he only has Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard and a bunch of other All-stars. They're getting outplayed by Rudy Gobert, Evan Fournier and Frank Ntilikina."
"Lets look at the stats of Damian Lillard and his teammates  Dame: 55/6/10 on 17/24 shooting 12/17 from 3, led the team in blocks and just 1 TO  CJ: 18/7/7 on 7/22 shooting 2/8 from 3 and fouled out  Nurk: 13/11 with 5/12 shooting, 6 turnovers as a big man, and fouled out.

NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
"Dude the NBA is an absolute joke now. I’m in my early 30s and grew up watching basketball, but I just can’t do it now. I bailed after the ref scandal because, how could you not? And since my boys (♩ ♪ ♫ sunny ♩ ♪ ♫) made the playoffs I decided to tune in. It’s straight up unwatchable garbage now. Each player is chucking up 10 threes a game and with 30% averages, it doesn’t really make for a good watch unless it’s Curry or Damian Lillard. Plus, let’s be honest, basketball is the EASIEST game to control via the refs. So I’m my opinion why would they not use that to their advantage. It was so obvious who the national media wanted to win this year, and not to take anything away from Giannis or the Bucs, but for how close a few of those games were, it was hard fighting back the thought of how much better off the NBA would be if Giannis won the ring and sure enough."
Damian Lillard is overrated.    He has 2-3 more years in his career before he drops off the face of the NBA.
"Team USA has Damian ""8 assists per game"" Lillard bro why would they need Trae and his playmaking?"
Damian Lillard..... Did you hit your head?
"Lillard is actually a French last name as is… Damien is obviously a French name too, though he spells it Damian."
irelli and the rest of the blazers bunch bout to come at you talking about 3 assist 4 turnover damian lillard being a true point guard.

"If you are actually trying to win the championship, trading Jaylen Brown for Damian Lillard shouldn't be a nonstarter."
"I hate agrigration so much. This link:  &gt;Report: Blazers star Damian Lillard plans to request trade originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston  Ok, that seems new. Let's see what NBC Sports Boston originally wrote -  &gt;TrueHoop's Henry Abbott reported that Friday that ""a source close to Lillard says that in the days to come, he plans to request a trade.""  Right, so nothing new."
Honestly fuck Damian Lillard.  How many times has he bitched about super teams and said shit about how he would rather play for his franchise and win the right way rather than jumping teams just to get rings?  His virtue signaling ass is just as greedy as the rest of them and I’m glad that’s coming to light now.
"Brandon Ingram -&gt; Philadelphia   Ben Simmons -&gt; Cleveland   Damian Lillard -&gt; New Orleans   Clevelands 3rd pick, New Orleans misc assets, Philadelphia misc assets -&gt; Portland   Does this represent a legitimately possible trade?"
Damian Lillard cannot be the best player on a championship team  is what it comes down to and he realizes that.
"Think the Warriors should have higher odds.  They probably have the best offer and Dame's from the Bay, just gonna come down to whether Dame would want to play with Steph or not.   No idea why the Knicks are that high, the Knicks + Dame would only be marginally better than the Blazers have been, and most certainly are not getting thru the Nets, Bucks, or Philly.   Philly seems like the perfect place for Dame. That's a legit contender, maybe even a favorite, but I kind of doubt they have the assets that a Damian Lillard would expect to be traded for."
Based on following Q I believe the part about him talking/texting with Beal who tells him stuff here and there. He also said that they had been talking about Team USA (this ended up being reported by the ESPN guys later on)  [Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard spoke at length about the possibility of playing alongside each other in the Olympics following their playoff exits.](https://twitter.com/RealQuintonMayo/status/1405963575953444866?s=20)  Beal and Lillard are very close so I think there's a high probability they talked about their careers and keep tabs on what each other are planning to do.
You make supplementary moves to win now.  I mean what are the Knicks doing if they're *turning down* the chance at getting Top 10 players? The whole point of accumulating draft picks and assets and having cap space in freaking New York of all places is so you can get a player like Damian Lillard.
Chauncey Billups beats Damian Lillard confirmed
"But its not like Damian Lillard is a known proud boy or anything. Lillard, tatum, smart, horford, and williams is a championship tier starting 5"
You can't be serious right?   Damian Lillard would be the best player you've had on the Knicks in 20 years...
"I think it would be absurd to not have Damian Lillard ahead of CP3. I don’t mind Chris Paul and loved him on the Thunder but Lillard is able to hit 3’s from the logo, is more clutch, and scores more. The turnover gap is minimal and the passing gap is not nearly as large as the scoring gap. The only reason Lillard gets massively underrated is because of loyalty but I have to respect a generational point guard who hit a series winner on my favorite team."
"&gt; The Portland Trail Blazers officially signed superstar point guard Damian Lillard to a four-year, $196 [million] supermax contract extension on Saturday [July 6, 2019], according to Sean Meagher of the Oregonian.    &gt; . . .    &gt; The contract will kick in for the 2021-22 season. Lillard is set to make $29.8 million next year [2019-20] and $31.6 million in the 2020-21 season, the final year of the five-year, $139.8 million deal he signed in 2016.    &gt; Per ESPN's Brian Windhorst, the final year of the [four-year, $196 million supermax] extension is a $54.3 million player option.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2837381-damian-lillard-on-supermax-contract-extension-weve-built-something-special  Not saying it's chump change, but I think he can afford $50,000 if he wants to publicly request an extension."
I’m requesting the Blazers trade Damian Lillard to Miami
"Damian Lillard is Damian Lillard tho. RJ Barrett can be anybody, even Damian Lillard"
"stop giving poorly run organizations free passes to superstars just because they're big  how the fuck do the Knicks, who have been relevant for maybe 3 years in the last 2 decades and for the other 17 been the poster child for dysfunction next to the fucking Kings and Timberwolves deserve a Damian Lillard with 4 years left on his contract? plenty of teams like the Nuggets, Heat or the Pelicans which either have great front offices, or the actual assets to trade for a superstar still under lease under a long term contract, or both, but no let's ship Dame to the Knicks cause that's what the NBA needs"
Quickley was a nice surprise but is he realistically going to be the best player in a trade package for Damian Lillard? Come on now.
"According to Sam Amick, Lowry was *almost* a 76er at last years deadline &amp; the Raptors have the 4th pick for any upcoming deals - [The Atheltic](https://theathletic.com/2478518/2021/03/26/why-no-kyle-lowry-trade-got-done-and-a-closer-look-at-the-ones-that-did-amicks-nba-trade-deadline-reflections/)  Simmons to the Blazers was already touched by David Aldridge too - [The Atheltic](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/nba-rumors-blazers-catch-heat-ben-simmons-damian-lillard-trade)  In the end, all these deals appear to have had some traction outside of just the *blog bois*."
Damian Lillard probably wont be a Blazer next season.
Y’all really about to believe a guy with a name Damian Lillard 🦎. 🤣🤣🤣. 🧢 🧢
"He needs to get the guys to play hard and understand that this matters.  &gt;“We’re not just going to come out here, roll the ball out and beat these teams,” Damian Lillard told reporters following the Australia loss. “We’ve got to play the right way, compete, and we’ve got to come out here to win and do everything to give ourselves our best chance to win. If we don’t, we can be beat.”  Thats Damian Lillard. Think you know more than him? Here is more:  &gt;“We didn’t sustain the boards the same way, the defense wasn’t the same, our pace wasn’t the same, so we got some guys that have to get their legs and rhythm back, but in general, we need more conditioning, which is totally understandable.”  Whose job is conditioning and practice? The coach."

This is Damian Lillard here. A team should be willing to part with virtually any player to get him.
Which team is going to add Damian Lillard to their roster for 4 years and have high draft picks to give to the Blazers?
"Did you just treat Damian Fucking Lillard as a 3rd tier quasi-star? Dude, it is Dame. Period. His presence alone makes any team in the league a playoff lock. Slot him with a defense as good as the Knicks and you are realistically battling for HFA."
How about Damian Lillard instead
Pure insanity. My goodness. 1 mediocre season and you're too good for Damian Fucking Lillard. My god
Ben Simmons plus 1st round pick for Damian Lillard makes the most sense for both teams.

"Haha I go for Charlotte, but couldn't Kemba be in the trade  Kemba, Bazley, Poku #6, #16, Clips 2022 first, Denver 2023 first, OKC 2024 first  For   Lillard  Then they could sign a center (or trade for one) and sign Kelly Oubre Jr and there have a pretty decent starting 5  Center TBC Kelly Oubre Jr Lu Dort Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Damian Lillard"
That’s a weird way to spell Damian Lillard
Correction Sixers star Damian Lillard
Normally you shouldn't. But if it means getting Damian fucking Lillard you include him in the goddamn trade
Do you know who Damian Lillard is? Lol
How can you say no to Dame?  That's the thing.  Not trying to get Harden was a miss and I love Murray but it's Damian Lillard we're talking about.
Ben Simmons for Damian lillard (with no other players) works salary wise.  I have to imagine Philly will have to overpay to acquire him.
I'll allow you to be a fan of the Spurs if you give us 1 Damian Lillard please.
Yes. Damian Lillard can come into the post to lift JJJ into the air so he can rebound. The only question is what will the over/under on torn acls be?
o no what will Kevin Durant Damian Lillard Devin Booker Jayson Tatum and Zach Lavine do without offensive help
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"

"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Duncan Robinson gave a look of pleasant surprise.

Damian lillard. Who says no
Anyone know who on the team is vaxxed? I know Damian Lillard is.
"Search “draymond green dirty plays” and “Russell Westbrook dirty plays” and see the difference.   I’m also referring to this specific series, I don’t have recollection of Westbrook kicking anybody in the head, and a quick search for it only has me seeing when he kicked the ball away from Damian lillard  Edit: in fact searching for draymond kicking someone in the head immediately brings up one on James harden, but the topic is on this series so let’s ignore that yeah?"
Cade is not going to live up to the hype. Zion will be top 5 in MVP voting. Damian Lillard will be wearing a Knicks jersey next season (and RJ Barrett a Blazers jersey).
"Just for a second imagine a Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry back court….even if Klay is a shell of himself, that is a contender."
"Youre somewhat right, but all those players also forced their way out to those teams. Damian Lillard hasn't given any evidence he wants out for sixers, he's actually done the opposite.  But you can also put that logic in Ben Simmons who wants out. They could end up trading down"
Damian Lillard?

"It’s not about the refs, it’s about the league and what they’re promoting and encouraging. Which is the top 20ish players in the league get preferential treatment. The top 8ish teams get preferential treatment. And those rules are administered by the refs, but referees aren’t the problem entirely.  Guys like Lebron, Harden, Embiid and Young all rightly get shit on for being flippers and baiting calls. But these last 2 exhibitions have proved it’s a league wide problem. You’ve got Damian Lillard, one of the best players in the world and guy who around NBA circles isn’t known for baiting calls, doing his best to do just that.   It’s an Adam Silver issue most of all. He refuses to change things. Players bait fouls, the faster you get to the bonus, the more commercial breaks you get. The more contested and reviewed calls, the more ads you can show. The NBA is assuming that people are okay with Trae Young dropping 42 points, because most casual fans will see 42 and 8 and think it’s great, without realizing that he shot 9/26 from the floor with 22 FT attempts to get it. The league has never been softer all around. One of the best players ever in Lebron, is known just as much for bitching and complaining to refs when he doesn’t get every call his way, as he is for throwing down dunks. That’s not sustainable. People are starting these comparisons for today’s up and comers with the old guard of late 90’s to mid 2000’s players, when you look back at Kobe or Wade or Dirk or TD, they don’t remember flopping or bitching to the refs non-stop. Even if the league does change for the better,  gonna be hard for guys like Young to shake the flipper moniker he’s earned.   The NBA is broken, and it’s an incredibly easy fix. And they just don’t care to do so"
"DEN will be without Jamal Murray for the entirety of next season as well. They got swept by PHX without Murray, LAC took PHX to 6 without Kawhi. POR might blow it up.

"Dame isn't at Giannis level. Even if they improve his supporting cast, there's a ceiling to a Damian Lillard led team."
Bernard King is in the HOF with 4 all stars and 4 all NBA. I don’t see why he is HOF worthy and Damian Lillard is not
it's interesting that apparently damian lillard isn't a real PG....
Yep that's one of the big problems.  Which is why if the Blazers want to come on down and open up your brand new Simmons and picks we'll gladly take one slightly pissed off Damian Lillard off your hands.
"No, this team however does have Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, and Bradley Beal so it's not like Luka would be the most important scorer on the floor by far if at all."
The Damian Lillard effect
"What the hell are you talking about. He has Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard. Those are *first ballot* hall of farmers. Autocorrect said farmers but I refuse to change it. You know why? Because it sounds absurd, just like what you said."
This sub is just hypersensitive to any Russ criticism (unless he recently had a bad game in which case he’s literally hitler). He is not a bad player but he is objectively a terrible fit on this team. I’d much rather Damian Lillard bring the ball up than Russell Westbrook
Nigeria doesn't have superstars who are used to playing by superstar rules.  Do you think Josh okogie gets the whistles Damian lillard does?
Damian Lillard is arguably better than Matthew Dellavedova though.

"In my previous comment, and now I don’t really like to think about the players perspective, but rather how I think the front office is feeling.   If dame is fine with being traded, not necessarily pushing for it, then I think Portland’s GM would strongly consider it.   Think of a conversation between the owner and GM, “Hey do you think we can win with Lillard?”  “Yeah we can still win with him”  If you say this and don’t win, it’s your fault for failing to build a team around him.   But if your response is “No we can’t win with him” then it isn’t your fault for losing, but Lillard for not being good enough!   To be honest I think it’s more realistic to think that Damian Lillard is not a clear number 1 option on a championship team. (Maybe he could win in a 1-a/1-b situation) And if you’re not tanking it’s very unlikely you find a guy better than Lillard in the draft, or on the market."
"Steph isn't taking a backseat to Damian Lillard. It made sense for KD because you could argue KD is better than Steph, but not Lillard"
"Lord god i come to you to ask, nay beg, i beg of you please let Damian Lillard come to the bay for that package."
"It seems you really just believe what he says and leave it at that. Which is ok, it's your superstar and your team. And he's been loyal up until now so maybe that's just what he wants.  I personally have a hard time believing his ""people are putting words in my mouth"" when talking about Chris Haynes, a journalist he's so close to he was willing to say on June 5th [""Jason Kidd is my guy""](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-on-portlands-head-coach-opening-jason-kidd-is-the-guy-i-want-043651102.html) for who the Blazers should hire.

I get the frustration, and people probably won't believe he'll retire a Blazer until he actually does. I think the reporting is significant enough and the context for the response makes sense after yet another bad playoff loss"
"I know I'm not a blazers fan, but it seems rather disingenuous to say this summer is the same as every offseason. Dame continues to get older, and the team has been drained of a lot of their assets and this group is not working. They're probably going to try it again but with Billups as a coach, MAYBE move CJ if the right package comes along but they are in a situation where Dame keeps getting a year older, still in his prime, and the team's WCF is more in the rear view than in the future.  This article by Chris Haynes is not something that I've seen written before, he's like one of the closest journalists to Dame https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-coaching-process-inability-to-build-title-contending-roster-may-push-damian-lillard-out-of-portland-203407770.html  My point was that this is significant, this is different, and the context of the team/Dame makes it a lot more understandable. Dame wasn't into his 30s last season or the year before. The Blazers had significantly more assets to change the makeup of the team last season or the year before. You hadn't fired Stotts in years past. How can you see that and believe nothing is different? You guys already made a big move BECAUSE it wasn't working"
"it’s Damian fucking Lillard, Morey will give up Maxey and Thybulle for him"
I too am going to put a trade package together for Damian Lillard.
"I’m sorry but what do reports without a direct quote from Lillard saying he’s thinking about leaving matter when I can give you countless direct quotes where he says he will retire a Blazer, or stay loyal to one franchise, or try to bring a Championship to Portland before he would ever think about leaving for greener pastures.   But this is that same thing every off season. “This is the year Damian Lillard leaves” and “it’s different this time bc (insert new reason)”"
"&gt;Bam + Herro for Dame   &gt;   &gt;Murray + MPJ for Dame  Lol, why would Heat or Nuggets give up the players they need to win a title if they're trading for Damian Lillard... to win a title? Especially the Nuggets trade, that's an overpay that makes the team worse."
"Wait, you legit think Wiseman after a disappointing rookie year, Wiggins, and two picks that don’t matter because you’re trying to win now is better than *Damian Lillard*?  When you can hit a shot anywhere at anytime, you fit any roster construction that could ever exist."

What happens if Damian Lillard fails? He gets criticism from the media and some fans but he still gets paid in the top 0.01% to play a ball game.  For the homeless guy or single mom it's starvation.  That's why I liked how he said challenge rather than pressure.
"He played well for the lakers too it was just that one game every one remembers. He’s a good player, he just thought he was Damian lillard."
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Andre Iguodala, Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, Damian Lillard  Edit: Marc and Pau Gasol"
"&gt;I mean George Karl is a dickhead, but he's not wrong and this is same sentiment his first coach had that was pretty much removed because of Carmelo.  Uh huh.  So was George Karl right about Demarcus Cousins, Damian Lillard, Ray Allen, Gary Payton, Kenyon Martin, Seth Curry, Andre Iguoudala, etc.  George Karl is tweeting that his coaching staff valued defense when his players have said that was the exact opposite of what went down in the locker room.   &gt;but he's not wrong and this is same sentiment his first coach had that was pretty much removed because of Carmelo.  Like everything is through this extremely shallow lens.   Bzdelik was fired for the exact same reason every other coach is fired in the league. Management wanted them to be doing better than they were doing. Carmelo had two coaches in Denver. Literally try applying the same metric to *any* other player.   &gt;The lockout impacted trade deals how?  Not all the traded players were on the team the next year. The lockout meant that those players who might have re-signed (such as to remain an asset) signed overseas.   &gt;So Melo had a poor coach-player relationship with Bzdelik, George Karl, and Mike D'Antoni to start his career. Karl is a known shithead, the other two are well liked and Mike D'Antoni is especially well liked by players and Melo essentially caused him to resign.  D'Antoni never wanted Melo to begin with, he wanted Deron Williams. D'Antoni was upset because Melo wouldn't reduce his role so he could have a point guard centered offense....on a team with the highest paid front-court in the league. D'Antoni's inability to adjust his system is what led him to resigning. And it's the *exact* same reason he didn't work out in LA."
"wow now you’re signing two players under contract? shit if you have that ability why settle for Zion and Ingram. Go grab Kawhi, Jokic, and Damian Lillard while you’re at it too!"

Damian Lillard and the blazers
"Lillard too. Karl went at him out of left field in an interview. He was asked for an example of how Melo used people (like he said in that quote).   He goes on about the “new generation of players” caring too much about off court things like brands and making money. He says it bothered him with Melo then and it bothers him with Lillard now.  By the way, he never coached Dame. Dame says they never even spoke. But apparently Karl had decided that the reason for the Blazers’ bad start to the season was Dame getting too much attention and that him seeing things off court as more important than things on court made it so the team couldn’t work together or feel as connected and committed. He lost any remaining credibility he had with me when he said that about Dame of all people.   Links to interview and article about it:  https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/12/george-karl-on-nba-conspiracies-phil-jackson-and-carmelo.html  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18367179/george-karl-pins-blame-damian-lillard-portland-trail-blazers-early-struggles"
I love Damian Lillard for what he’s done for the Blazers but him and Luka in Dallas would be fun to watch.
MVP race:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Jayson Tatum 3. Kevin Durant 4. Steph Curry 5. Trae Young 6. Giannis 7. James Harden 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kyrie Irving 10. Devin Booker

the disrespect to damian “aidman” lillard
Damian Lillard just looks so cool with everything he does
Patty Mills vs Damian Lillard
Blazers rumors: “goal is less to keep Damian Lillard and more to not acquire Ben Simmons”
"&gt;In some weird way, it's like Olshey and Morey are in a weird game of chicken where whoever admits their roster is fatally flawed first loses.  It's precisely because both of them are so stubborn that I believe a Sixers-Blazers trade is unlikely. What do the Blazers get out of trading for a player who is owed 170 million over the next 4 seasons including the trade kicker? He's the absolute opposite of the franchise player brand Dame has built in Portland over the last 9 years, and will definitely turn fans off attending games if he keeps up his current attitude.  In all honesty, I don't think the Blazers are going to approve a Damian Lillard trade until Jody Allen finds a buyer for the team. it'll be up to the new owner whether they decide to go boom or bust."
I also suspect it might take a little bit of time for Sengun to adjust to the NBA ball.  We just saw an elite shooter in Damian Lillard struggle shooting all Olympics with shooting the FIBA ball.   Sengun uncharacteristically had a bad free throw shooting night and didn't finish particularly well compared to how he played in Europe.
"Yesssir. Just need to wait for the trade request. All the pieces are honestly in place.  Superstar says team as currently constructed isn't good enough to win&gt;  Superstars front office makes no moves to improve the team or shake up the roster&gt;  If Portland starts .500 or so through the first 20 games narrative will begin to shift to ""Damian Lillard owes nothing to the trailblazers"". Which COULD lead to the trade request"

"What other franchise has similar assets to Maxey, Thybulle, and a few (non-lottery) picks? Virtually all of them. More likely than not the leak about not wanting to play in Toronto/Portland came from Simmons (the only one who has something to gain from leaking that info) - if we accept that as true they aren't going to give up DAMIAN FUCKING LILLARD for a project that doesn't want to improve or be there.  Literally any contender would kill for Dame, his haul would be close to Kawhi level and Sixers don't have a Kawhi level haul to return with Simmons, let alone with him being a question mark to actually playing for a non-Cali team.  Also I promise you no one values Maxey and Thybulle the way your front office and fans do."
"Right, never mind that the last thing the Blazers want is Ben Simmons and no Damian Lillard 😂"
I predict a three team trade  Sixers get: Damian lillard  Warriors get: Ben Simmons  Blazers get: a fuck ton of young guys and picks
This feels like Celtics biding their time for Anthony Davis only for him to go to the Lakers. Can I put a bet on Damian Lillard forcing a trade to the Knicks instead of the Sixers?
damian lillard
"I feel like people underestimate traes potential to be one go the greater PGs of all time…  29 and 9 in his second season, conference finals in his third season while averaging 28 and 8 in the playoffs…that’s a better start to a career than Curry, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Westbrook, Nash, and Harden"
It came out right after the gold medal game that he had an abdomen injury.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2021/08/07/damian-lillard-played-through-abdominal-injury-during-olympics/amp/  Not trying to make excuses for him but he clearly didn’t look like himself.
"simply trade for Damian Lillard, ezpz"
I too would like one Damian Lillard please
"My point is whenever those guys made legitimate runs, they had that consistent star with them and healthy. Dirk made his 2 finals run without one. And every season for 11 years led his team to 50 wins despite playing with so many different groups. Like yes KG had worse teammates, but KG also did not achieve much in terms of team success. David Robinson and Hakeem I can give you but like you realize most of the stars had help, right? There's so many names we are not talking about. I'm not saying Dirk was the only guy who didn't get a lot of help and still had a lot of success, but he's one of few.  Damian Lillard also does not deserve to be in this conversation with these guys. We are talking about a bunch of top 30 all-time guys right now. You can't say ""Durant got lucky."" Don't even include KD in this, he had the most help ever when he won his championship and was on a very talented team when he first reached the finals."
"he was good for the stretch run of 2011-2012 when he first got to the Nets, but the next season he fell off hard.  His scoring average went from 15 PPG down to 7.7 in 12-13 and his efficiency plummeted.  He only lasted 1 more season in Brooklyn and averaged 5 PPG before becoming salary filler in the Piece/KG trade to the Nets.    Also the Nets gave up the #6 pick in the draft to get Wallace because the Nets said it was a 3 player draft, that pick became Damian Lillard.  All things considered Gerald Wallace was a dud for the Nets."
"Unfortunately they lost to the 82-0 Blazers in the finals 10 times in an row, Damian Lillard is 45 and has just won his 6 straight mvp alongside Bron Jr, Nassir, Anfernee Simons and Luka Doncic, etc. Simons is best 3pt shooter ever, Luka is still great even though he is very old. Blazers Are coached by Brandon Roy and Aldridge, Cj McCollum is the owner of the blazer after retiring in 2029."
"I just google KD weight and it brought up 240.  Even if he is not 240, you have to remember, KD is 6'10. He is at least 200 easy if not 220.   Even at 200 pounds, KD has 60 pounds on Muggsy and 18 inches on Mugsey.  Definitely understand ""center of gravity"" and ""lifting"" but even  Damian Lillard said FIBA basketball is tougher than NBA and KD has put up 30/30/29 in 3 gold medal games.  You are dreaming if you don't think KD is not an  easy  25ppg career scorer in the 90s."
"I believe it was more Kobe's doing. **From Wikipedia:**  ""His injury came while he was playing seven consecutive quarters and at least 40 minutes for seven consecutive games. The 34-year-old Bryant was averaging his most minutes (38.6) in six years, and only Portland rookie Damian Lillard was averaging more minutes. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak had spoken to Bryant about his extensive playing time 10 days earlier, but Bryant insisted the minutes needed to continue given the Lakers' playoff push."""
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.foxsports.com/stories/nba/damian-lillard-clutch-michael-jordan-portland-trail-blazers-cj-mccollum   “He has made 25 game-tying or go-ahead shots in the final 20 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. That's more than anyone else since he entered the NBA in 2012-13. “  Quoted from the article
Over rated ? Most clutch points scored last season was by Damian Lillard and scoring those points with a 83% true shooting percentage. Literally NOTHING over rated about that
Damian Lillard
You wouldnt give that up Damian Lillard?
"Oh yeah, typical third stringers Damian Lillard, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant. Dudes who barely can see the floor in the NBA. You this ignorant?"
It's the c team now? Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard are the c team?
Damian lillard is a superstar in this league and that was essentially his role in these olympics lmao
Damian Lillard will never lead a team to an NBA championship
It is embarrassing to call Damian Lillard a superstar.
"Kevin Durant really bailed out this team. A lot of guys owe him big time, from the players to Popovich.  Priority 1 for 2024 has to be bringing Kevin Durant back. Priority 2 needs to be getting Stephen Curry on the team. We can't risk having C-list stars like Damian Lillard on the team again."
Damian “Small Market” Lillard 🤡
Damian lillard really not used to being a role player
Damian Lillard does sound kinda French
Did I just hear Vince carter call Damian lillard a gamer lmao
does damian lillard play in the nba?
Honestly I think Pop would bench him if his name was not Damian lillard.
Damian Lillard been useless
"Luka was relatively new in the NBA vs several year veteran Damian Lillard.  Not that he was wrong, but he ain't earned the ""stripes"" to be that honest yet.  That said, I got what he meant, it was never a talent thing, just how they call it. Offensive players are so favored in the NBA."
Gonna be really awkward at the Damian Lillard Toyota campus in March.

When I say Damian Lillard might be the least criticized star athlete I’ve ever seen in my life I’m not exaggerating.  I’m sure “Damebestpg” is objective about this subject though.
"Can we consider Ben Simmons a PG?   Because if so  PG - Chris Paul    SG - Damian Lillard    SF -  Steph Curry    PF - Jrue Holiday    C - Ben Simmons      Could sub Dame for Kyrie honestly, I know people will drag me for having Jrue Holiday and Simmons over (INSERT ANY STAR CALIBER PG HERE) but with a backcourt and SF position who are all mediocre at best on defense, you’re going to need some size in the front court."
ESPN tomorrow: “Will the blazers trade Damian Lillard for all of the Lakers free agency acquisitions?”
"If this was about any other player it would have never even been posted. People legit hate Ben Simmons so they'll believe anything that makes him look bad or feeds into their preconceived notions about him.   This has just allowed so many people to call him a baby, a whiner, etc. So let me get this straight, no one else knows anything about what this dude is ""reporting"" including local guys like Bodner, Nuebeck, and even Pompey, but this guy knows. So he must be getting his info from Klutch or Ben. And Rich Paul, in his infinite wisdom, decides it would be in his client's best interest that the NBA world knew that Ben is a ""socialite"" who will pick where he's going based on the nightlife or whatever the hell.   Again, the organization that is so damn leaky that they couldn't even keep quiet about the fact that they wanted Matisse Thybulle long enough to draft him without him being held hostage by the Celtics, somehow kept everyone unaware of the fact that *Ben Simmons* has not spoken to *anyone* from the Sixers since the season ended. *Ben Simmons*, the same player who has drawn just a little bit of interest this off-season, has not spoken to the team and nobody local or national knows. Only this one random dude from California.   Good news Sixers fans, this is the same guy that said Damian Lillard was requesting a trade ""tomorrow"" and he's got it on good authority that Philly and New York are his top two choices. So we're good either way I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️."
"I think basketball players would lose less embarrassingly playing soccer. They have size and athleticism, and that was good enough for Peter Crouch's career.  I mean they're definitely conditioned differently so maybe they would be gasses after one half, but if they play super defensively they can rotate people in and out of the back line to give everyone some time where they can just stand around.  Remember the tallest soccer player is like 6'2"", 6'3"" maybe. Damian Lillard and Steph Curry won't even have to shoot from 35ft to just shoot it right over any defenders. Or you could just put out our best wings and have everyone play only above their defenders' reach.  The basketball players would be soundly beaten. But it would only be a little bit worse than real soccer players get beaten. The soccer players would be beaten 300,400-0. Maybe 400-2."
Damian Lillard. Klay Thompson.
Damian Lillard does not get criticized lmao stop being a victim
"34 years old Damian Lillard.   Lamelo LaFrance Ball, assuming Hornets don't find the success they envisioned.  Or any PG from Klutch (Ben Simmons, Trae Young, Darius Garland)  I'm just thinking of PGs for AD, hoping he stays."
“Damian Lillard has requested a trade”
"Very very high on Ben Simmons. Very very low on Damian Lillard. Don’t think we should be giving Portland ben just for Dame but if we must, so be it"
"Henry Abbott published a story claiming that Dame was getting ready to ask for a trade.  [Dame publicly suggested that Abbott was publishing lies and slandered his professional integrity.](https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/damian-lillard-henry-abbot-trade-rumors-truehoop-01fbswr161re)  Abbott was the head of ESPN's digital coverage of the NBA for five years.  If Dame asks for a trade, that would mean he tried to ruin a man's professional reputation in a profession where reputation means everything just to cover his own ass despite knowing that the guy was telling the truth."
"Dame is comfortably superior to Kyrie? The last time I examined the post-season of one Damian Lillard, he was remarkably pedestrian.   Let's examine this by year:   2014 - Lost in the 2nd Round. You know what, I'll give Dame a pass here. It was his first playoffs and while he wasn't special against the Spurs, I mean this Spurs team was on another level. He also knocked out the Rockets with a great buzzer beater. One of his few accomplishments to date.   2015 - Lost in the 1st Round. Even accounting for the defense of the grizz, dame played like an absolute basket case during almost the entirety of the series.   2016 - Lost in the 2nd Round. Some people would give Dame a pass for losing to the warriors. I however will not. Why? Because Steph was out for 3 games and the blazers still went down 0-2, that's why.   There is no shame in losing to the full strength '16 warriors, there is shame however in losing to solo Klay. Some might throw CJ under the bus, however Dame shot putrid in game 1 and performed even worse than CJ in game 2.   2017 - Swept in the 1st round. I am not gonna blame him, because nobody was stopping this warriors team and it took a record breaking performance by the cavs to even beat them. Losing to them is fair enough.  2018 - Swept in the 1st round. You know what, I would argue this is his worst series to date. CJ famously declared there'd be no more layups, and AD proceeded to body them. To make matters worse for Dame, his play was vastly inferior to Jrue Holiday's who straight up shut lillard down while giving him the business offensively.   2019 - Swept in the Conference Finals. You brought this up. In 2019, Dame had an all-time shot giving him his second accomplishment in the post season. However, after that he was carried by CJ against the Nuggets. He had 0 to do with the eventual game 7 win even. He scored 13 points in 45 minutes, 0 game impact and thus 0 credit.   He proceeded to get torched by Steph, Klay, and G-Leaguers when they were inarguably the better team and expected to beat the warriors. To make matters worse, he did absolutely nothing of note other than play atrocious every single game of the series.   2020 - Lost in the First Round.  Some wouldn't blame him for losing to the Lakers. I will however. He was sensational game 1, garbage game 2, decent in game 3, putrid in game 4 upon which he exited the series with an injury. 2 horrific games outweigh a decent game and a great game in my books. He did well during the bubble however, I'll grant that.  2021 - He played really well, he mostly avoids blame. Overall, he played well enough to win the series if we only consider his play. He did have some stinkers/bad performances, but whatever.  After reviewing all of this, I fail to see what Dame has accomplished in the post season that can compare to Kyrie, to be quite honest. Particularly given he is mostly losing in the 1st round."
Are there no other shots for Prepelic than chucking 3s from Damian Lillard range?
FALSE.  Bears.  Beets.  Damian Lillard.
"yeah lol the only superstars in league are Lebron, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi and Giannis.  AD isn't, Damian Lillard most definitely is not."
"It’s so weird. I know we talk about roster construction but the honest truth is the Damian lillard, Tatum, etc are being outplayed by guys like patty mills, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Fournier. I have no idea why international players seem to get way better in fiba while USA players seem to play much worse!"
"So you got Damian Lillard, one of the best shooters of all time and he doesn't take a shot or 3 in the first quarter?  Pathetic fucking coaching right there."
"Yes, trading Wiseman, Kuminga and Moody for Damian Lillard would be a bad move. Terrible move. Just terrible."
"Damn, you're right   2012 Pick 6 Damian Lillard - Home run pick  Pick 11 Meyers Leonard (career backup and heated gamer)  Pick 40 Will Barton (traded third year with others for 35 year old Marcus Camby)  Pick 41 Tyshawn Taylor (traded)  2013 Pick 10 CJ McCollum - another good one  Pick 39 Jeff Withey (traded)  Pick 40 Grant Jerrett (traded)  Pick 45 Marko Todorovic (traded)  2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace  2015 Pick 23 Rondae Hollis Jefferson (traded to Brooklyn)  2016 (first round pick traded year before for Arron Afflalo who left at season’s end)  2017 Pick 15 Justin Jackson (traded)  Pick 20 Harry Giles (traded)  Pick 26 Caleb Swanigan (traded halfway through season)  2018 Pick 24 Anfernee Simons (honestly, doing fine for being the 24th pick)  2019 Pick 25 Nassir Little  2020 Pick 16 Isaiah Stewart (traded)  Pick 46 CJ Elleby"
"Kristaps. If he flops this year, there’s no Carlisle to blame. No Donnie Nelson to point the finger at for poor roster construction if it comes to that.  Ben is obvious.  I think Neil Olshey’s seat is about to get very toasty soon. How he’s failed to build around Damian Lillard year in and year out is puzzling. Portland always seems to have something in terms of cap flexibility and draft capital, but just can never put everything together to make a balanced roster. I put that on Olshey (and partly on Terry Stotts, who’s gone)."
"Yes, like people in the social media era roasted the Grizzlies for picking Ja Morant (Murray State) and Damian Lillard (Weber State)."
Damian Lillard stares at Olshey
How do Damian and Steph both play point?   Move Steph to the 2 or Damian? Klay gets moved to 3? So klay 6’6” will be guarding LeBron or Durant? Curry and Lillard are both “shorter” guards that arent top tier defenders
"Kyrie, a player known for his scoring, put up 20.4/4.4/6.4 on 35.6/22/91 shooting splits against the Bucks in 2019.  Embiid, against the Raptors, put up 18/9/3 on 37/34/84 shooting splits.  Lowry against the Wizards put up 12/5.5/4.8 on 32/22/73 shooting splits.  Harden put up 24.5/4.5/10 on 41/31/88 shooting splits against the Spurs in 2017.  Damian Lillard against the Pelicans in 2018 put up 18.5/4.5/4.8 on 35/30/88 shooting splits.  Durant against the Mavericks in 2016 put up 26/6.4/3.2 on 37/28/85 shooting splits.  STEPH CURRY put up 24/5/5 on 40/28/90 shooting splits against the Rockets in 2019 with KEVIN DURANT, KLAY THOMSON, AND DRAYMOND ON HIS TEAM.  Dirk in his MVP year as first seed against the Warriors put up 19.7/11.3/2.3 on 38/21/84 shooting splits.  Russ put up 19/10.4/11.8 on 33/25/65 shooting splits.   Seems like other top 15 players 100% would put up such awful shooting splits in a single series with crappy teammates or against great defensive teams with a gameplan to stop them."
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
I want nothing  I want nothing  I want no Damian Lillard  Tell Portland  To find a new slant
"We did it, we got Damian Lillard&gt;!'s trainer!&lt;"
"10000% this. People whining about this free agency because they haven't experienced the futility of Jason Kapono being our biggest free agent signing.  This team is young and promising, its not a title contention team.  Barnes isn't going to win rookie of the year playing 35 minutes a game leading us to 50 wins.  Damian Lillard for Siakam is not going to happen.  Richaun fucking Holmes is not going to bring us a championship.  Even some of the more prominant Raptors analysts seemed to think we were in for a quick turnaround, when I was saying since last season's trade deadline we are 3-5 years away from being good enough to contend. We don't have a Championship level first option guy and none of the rookies are ready to be that within the next few seasons except *maaybe* Cade."
"&gt; He averaged about the same on 3 more attempts at a game. Ergo, Duncan is the better shooter.  Whoa!  First of all, getting more shots makes it easier to get into a rhythm.  A guy who shoots 40% on one 3 per game is likely a better shooter than a guy who shoots 40% on ten 3 per game.  Second, Powell shot 6 shots per game on a team with sharpshooter Damian Lillard, while Robinson shot his on a team where he was the primary sharpshooter.  Anyone will tell you it's far harder to shoot from Powell's position than Robinson's.  The idea that a guy shoots three more shots a game and only shoots the same percentage is proof he's a worse shooter.  That's just ridiculous to claim otherwise.  It really isn't that hard."
Damian Lillard is not a superstar and i'm sorry if i'm the first person that had to tell you the truth...
"It's like the Kings had to pick Thomas Robinson because they fell to him, instead of Damian Lillard, who they were planning on drafting. Same with Mclemore over McCollum who we all but guaranteed would be in a Kings uniform. FML"
"Also shout out the Kings who picked Thomas Robinson one pick ahead of Damian Lillard back in 2012, which set them back a number of years to put them in position to pick Bagley over Luca in 2019."
"Lmao, you got caught red handed and pulled an explanation out of your ass. Lebron’s defensive rating has been well above average for the past two seasons. [He was making a case for all-defensive team before he went down in March.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-star-index-lebron-james-continues-to-make-all-defense-case-but-damian-lillard-has-jumped-him-in-mvp-race/) EVERY fan who watches the Lakers knows this. You want to be taken seriously so bad it’s hilarious"
The new Damian Lillard foul baiting rule.
"See also, Damian Lillard in 2017: Speaking to Sporting News that year, Lillard was asked whether expectations from the previous year were creating “pressure” for him and his team.     ""Pressure, nah. Fam, this is just playing ball,” the Portland Trail Blazers point guard replied. “Pressure is the homeless man, who doesn’t know where his next meal is coming from. Pressure is the single mom, who is trying to scuffle and pay her rent.”      “We get paid a lot of money to play a game,” he went on. “Don’t get me wrong ― there are challenges. But to call it pressure is almost an insult to regular people.”"
"I got a lot of downvotes for mocking the Tony Snell signing.   With that being said, Damian Lillard has zero excuses not to win a championship this year.   Dame+CJ+Nurk+Snell=superteam"
Damian Lillard is getting traded
"OK HEAR ME OUT  This sounds crazy but 3 team deal centered around:  Celtics get: Damian Lillard and KAT  Portland gets: JB or JT (I value both the about the same and idk who the FOs prefer or how the money works)  Wolves get: Smart, Timelord, and a pick or two from Portland, and basically every Celt's first rounder possible  Ik there's prob a lot of filler needed and the Wolves prob need a little more, but I think the framework is something to think about."

I didn’t realize until now that the Suns are currently 1-3.. why is no-one talking about this?

"James Harden, Trae Young, and now Damian Lillard are the most vocal critics against the new rule changes.  I for one, am shocked"
I can’t see a trade package for Damian Lillard that isn’t just a giant favor to whichever team he’s traded to.  Also such a trade would basically guarantee the Blazers would be shit for the foreseeable future
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10.

"At this point we need the AutoMod to add a top level comment on every post that says ""Curry is better than Damian Lillard and is a good defender"" so that these ppl can get the validation they need without having to go through the trouble of commenting"
Curry is miles better on defense than Damian Lillard

"Derrick Rose is a very intriguing case. For one thing, even at the time that he won MVP, there were a lot of people who thought he shouldn’t have won it. Also, D Rose’s MVP season came juuust before pace and 3 point shooting truly exploded. He averaged 25 and 7 in 2010-11, his best season. Great numbers, but if you stacked them up next to today’s stars they don’t look like anything crazy. Damian Lillard averaged 29 and 7 last year, 30 and 8 the year before, and came in 7th and 8th in MVP voting in those years. I feel that D Rose might be stuck in that middle ground, where his peak numbers are compared with many of today’s stars, despite being from a truly different era of basketball.  I think Rose would have put up huge numbers had we gotten the chance to see him at the height of his powers for the last decade, but unfortunately we were robbed of that chance. I don’t think he has the resume to warrant being a Hall of Famer. However, he has also carved out a nice career for himself after the injury, so I won’t say it’s impossible he gets in. He was a great college player and had a legendary NCAA tournament run to the championship game, although they lost and the whole season was later vacated. He was at one point considered by many to be the best player in the league and has an MVP award to solidify that claim. He has legendary status as a “what could have been” story, and for that reason I think he could possibly still get in."
"Well, I could probably look a little more but off the top of my head, I was thinking of Damian Lillard.   He probably signed his contract believing the team would legitimately make moves to be contenders and nothing has been done to improve it really, and i believe he is upset about that. If I remember correctly there may have even been rumours to lose some good players to keep under the luxury tax.   This isn’t the same situation, but I just wanted to provide an example of how both sides need to honour their commitments if we talking about setting precedents for upholding contracts."

I can’t believe they put Damian Lillard on it over him when his biggest accomplishment is getting swept in the West Conference Finals against the KD-less Warriors in 2019. Dwight led his team to the Finals &amp; beat LeBron on that same run and won 3 straight DPOYs.
PTB starting lineup is just Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard is really good at basketball
[Read this](https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html) then shut the fuck up and piss off with this stupid never ending nonsense. Christ how many times does he have to say it?
"He really only had a 5-6 year stretch of being an elite player.  From 07-11 he was a top tier player in the league, then he got injured in 12 and things declined from there.  On the Lakers/Rockets he still put up good numbers but he was nowhere near what he was in terms of impact like in Orlando, and then he spent years putting up numbers that looked good while moving from team to team cause they didn't want him.  The two people that people say Dwight should've been over are Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.  Davis misses 15-20 games a year usually due to injuries but his numbers and impact on the team have been much better than peak Dwight, and Lillard's been one of the best scorers in the league for a long while, and very likely will remain an elite scorer.  AD over Dwight no question, and Dame/Dwight is honestly a toss-up, and Dwight's personality driving him off of multiple teams is enough of an X-factor against him in the toss-up"
it’s not even ab liking curry it’s literally a role player and a horrible player in ben simmons for fucking damian lillard😭😭
"Well for Maria putting Damian lillard 30th overall in front of some legends of the game,  is ,to say the least, perplexing ."
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"As many instances as there were in the past, they never occurred at the volume we’re seeing today.  All the instances you’ve mentioned may be true, but guarantee you the shot breakdown is catch and shoot. Orlando’s team is built on perimeter shots and Dwight. Ray Allen is Ray Allen; Gilbert is Gilbert, Reggie Miller is Reggie Miller, Steve Kerr is Steve Kerr.  Fact is the season Steph started taking 8 pull up / off the dribble 3s a game is the season that ushered in the modern era. James Harden, Dantoni / Morey Rockets, Damian Lillard, Paul George, and today’s Trae Young Buddy shield etc are all a product of Curry opening those gates.  It’s not just the volume, it’s also the type, the acceleration across seasons, etc. And with this came an entire shift in team defenses.  I’m no Curry Stan. I’m a Hakeem / Kobe / MJ / Bird are GOATs, and a Laker fan through and through. I just respect what he’s done."
Damian Lillard and I are basically the same person.
Lebron would be a better fit with Damian Lillard than Norman Powell
"Its been 10 games lmao. With your stupid take it would mean that Harrison Barnes is better than Embiid as well, or that Cole Anthony is better than Damian Lillard."

You magic fana really want fultz to start over your very own damian lillard?
Rozier be taking over late games like he’s Damian Lillard sometimes
My argument for keeping Damian Lillard out of the Top 75 list was:  ---  When is he the best player on the floor at something other than 3 point shooting?  You are not proven in this league until you can grind out wins with something other than a hot shooting night from deep. It's too give and take.

Damian “Anthony Bennett” Lillard
"Damian ""Russell Westbrook"" Lillard"
&gt; I can make a post that Damian Lillard is shooting worse from the field than Russel Westbrook. Is that a bait post?  absolutely lol.   a post like that is made purely to draw in westbrook haters and turn into a westbrook hate thread
"What, can’t have fun in a post anymore? I just made a joke about Anthony Bennett but that doesn’t change the main message of the post: “Cade is shooting worse than Anthony Bennett.” It’s you and all these other people who twisted this post into a troll/bait post.   With your little sensitive feelings, I’m sure you think any post that implies that a player is playing terribly is a bait/troll post?  Gtfo here with your cupcake feelings. Face the facts. Factually, Cade is shooting worse than Bennett. He had a solid game today, and was clutch other than the crucial turnover.   I can make a post that Damian Lillard is shooting worse from the field than Russel Westbrook. Is that a bait post? No. That’s just facts. Because Damian Lillard *is* shooting worse than Russ."

"&gt;What? I don't think there's any way you're a consistent Nuggets watcher if you think that's hyperbole--and referencing his uptick in assists via the box score is a horrendous way to make your point. The kinds of passes he has added, the areas in which he is able to thread things, the ease of his reads, are so much better than they were prior. He hasn't had trouble getting Jokic the ball in the post for 2 years.  He still has trouble getting the ball to Jokic in the post, though he is much better at it. I don't see why it's relevant that he's better now. He's clearly worth the max now which isn't my point.   &gt;You're telling me that in his first playoff series ever Jamal struggled somewhat to guard an very athletic and Derrick White who had at least 15 points on him at that point? I mean. Shocker. Derrick White is a good player and played his best basketball in that series.   He didn't struggle somewhat, he simply struggled. Also don't act like it's normal for anyone to struggle while guarding Derrick White. He's an average player at best. If you're gonna undermine all of Jamal's weaknesses while enhancing his strengths there's no point in having a discussion.   &gt;What about Jamal playing much better defense against Damian Lillard the series after that?  You can't seriously tell me I don't watch the Nuggets and come out and say this. He didn't even guard Lillard.   &gt;Sexton is a 6'1"" guard who can solely score and doesn't do it efficiently  He is 6'1"" but that's an ok size for a point guard. His wingspan is same as Jamal's. He's also more efficient than Jamal was at that point and much more consistent.   &gt;furthermore his shot doesn't look particularly good, it really isn't very good,   Again, he's more efficient than Jamal and has shot around 40% from 3 every year. Again better than Jamal at the same point of his career.   &gt;and so you have a tiny slashing guard who can't score, can't facilitate, and doesn't play defense.  He scored 24 points on 55 ts% last year. Jamal in his 3rd year scored 18 on 54 ts% with much less consistency as well. I think Sexton had clearly shown both a higher scoring potential and floor than Jamal. Jamal's passing was better but not by much. Sexton is one of the worst in the league. Jamal was still below average though , there's a reason a shit ton of Nuggets fans were doubting if playing him at 2 would be better for the team. Jamal clearly had much more potential there than Sexton.   &gt;Unlike Murray who showed he had the size and physical tools to at least be a good team defender (and is now one of the better PoA defenders in the league at his position) Sexton has consistently ranked at the very bottom of multiple defensive metrics. Dead last in DRAYMOND in his second season and second worse in DRPM behind Trae Young. On top of that he was near the bottom of the league in net rating and turnover% as well.  &gt;Some of this has to do with how bad the Cavs were on defense, but the Nuggets weren't a whole lot better at times. Especially during the seasons when Jokic was genuinely not a good defender.  Sexton is a bad defender but so was Jamal. Defensive stats are also garbage so there's no telling how much better Jamal was on defense than Sexton now.   To sum it up. Sexton is a much better scorer, much more consistent, proven by all the stats. Jamal was the better passer defender and had slightly better physical attributes. Neither should have gotten the max, both had glaring weaknesses. Again, you're making Sexton's sound like the end of the world. At the same time you're making Jamal's sound like small inconveniences on the road to greatness. Which for me they weren't.   &gt;I don't care about what people are upvoting and I'm talking to you about the things you did say. Also, the opinion of the majority was right. The opinion of the front office was right. For some reason you are more interested in proving that you weren't wrong than you are admitting that the Nuggets knew what they were doing when they decided to take the calculated risk of maxing a young player, as a max rookie RFA is always a risk of some sort.  You say they took a calculated risk, I say they took a gamble. An unnecessary one. The scenario where Jamal doesn't improve at all was just as likely, everything else are fairy tales. Waiting another year to max him carries much more benefits than consequence. Getting a better look at a player is much more worth than ""he may get annoyed and won't re-sign in 5 years"".   If he doesn't improve you're gonna be able to retain him even 5 years down the road cos he won't be commanding a max. And in case he really doesn't want to re-sign 5 years down the road, replacing an 18/4/5 guy isn't too hard"

Damian Lillard.
"&gt; No it's not. Sexton just posted better numbers and they didn't want to give him 100mil. It wasn't shocking that he was inconsistent, it was shocking how inconsistent he was and it was shocking that he hadn't improved on it since coming to the league.  Because looking at numbers isn't a good way to tell if a player is worth giving a max contract to or not. It is so much more nuanced and complicated and in depth than looking at someone's bball ref page.   &gt; His playmaking improved a bit, huge is a hyperbole and you know it. He upped his assists by 1.4 and still struggled to get the ball to Jokic in the post. As for his so called defensive improvement i would suggest you take a look at him attempting to guard Derrick fucking White in the playoffs.  What? I don't think there's any way you're a consistent Nuggets watcher if you think that's hyperbole--and referencing his uptick in assists via the box score is a horrendous way to make your point. The kinds of passes he has added, the areas in which he is able to thread things, the ease of his reads, are so much better than they were prior. He hasn't had trouble getting Jokic the ball in the post for 2 years.   You're telling me that in his first playoff series ever Jamal struggled somewhat to guard an very athletic and Derrick White who had at least 15 points on him at that point? I mean. Shocker. Derrick White is a good player and played his best basketball in that series. What about Jamal playing much better defense against Damian Lillard the series after that?   &gt; His growth wasn't linear. Going from year 2 to year 3, he improved his passing and his efficiency went down. Meanwhile every 5 games or so he would tweak something, or roll an ankle etc. And since i already used Sexton as an example-Sexton had 48 games where he scored 20+, Jamal had 28 in a longer season. His inconsistency was insane.  Growth isn't linear. But Jamal's growth has been about as linear as it gets. Inconsistency is one of the least worrisome things in a player when they show that they work hard and have that All-Star caliber play inside of them. Young players always get more consistent unless they truly bust. They knew he would and he has.  &gt; Everyone on here is upvoting this when i literally didn't say it. The opinion of the majority isn't always right.  I don't care about what people are upvoting and I'm talking to you about the things you did say. Also, the opinion of the majority was right. The opinion of the front office was right. For some reason you are more interested in proving that you weren't wrong than you are admitting that the Nuggets knew what they were doing when they decided to take the calculated risk of maxing a young player, as a max rookie RFA is always a risk of some sort.  &gt; Would you give Sexton the max though?  No.   Sexton is a 6'1"" guard who can solely score and doesn't do it efficiently -- furthermore his shot doesn't look particularly good, it really isn't very good, and so you have a tiny slashing guard who can't score, can't facilitate, and doesn't play defense.   That's also the archetype of a player who doesn't fit in very well with teams, can't play off-ball like Murray can and hasn't shown the ability to not be a black hole on offense.   Unlike Murray who showed he had the size and physical tools to at least be a good team defender (and is now one of the better PoA defenders in the league at his position) Sexton has consistently ranked at the very bottom of multiple defensive metrics. Dead last in DRAYMOND in his second season and second worse in DRPM behind Trae Young. On top of that he was near the bottom of the league in net rating and turnover% as well.   Some of this has to do with how bad the Cavs were on defense, but the Nuggets weren't a whole lot better at times. Especially during the seasons when Jokic was genuinely not a good defender.   The things teams look for as far as upside, tells of potential growth and future value, ways that a player can succeed in the NBA on ball, off ball, man defender, help defender, are not there for Sexton in the way they are for Murray, or SGA, or even MPJ to a lesser extent.   The offensive ones aren't anywhere near good enough to make up for the defensive issues like in the case for Trae Young who will likely rate as the worst defender at his position for the rest of his career.   The defensive ones are no good either and the physical tools aren't something you can suggest future success either.  So no, Sexton doesn't get a max. He is a great example of the antithesis of Jamal Murray however in how teams properly evaluate players."
Nikola “Damian Lillard” Jokic
Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Damian Lillard?
"But I think Pippen’s angst is stemming from not being considered a great player in his own right at all. And as the years roll on, he’s going to be seem merely as just a “Robin” instead of a great player he was.  In fifteen years when every point guard in 6’11” with half court range, a lot of fair weather fans are going to shrug off players like Damian Lillard and Jimmy Butler from our current era. Pippen probably knows that he’s already being pushed out of “great” conversations for people like Kawhi and Giannis, just like he and MJ were pushing Pete Maravich and George Gervin out of the conversations by the late 1980s.  It’s a vicious cycle. And I think we’re seeing Pippen coming to terms with it."
"As Chris Haynes detailed in an extensive story for Yahoo Sports, the two Lakers stars wined and dined Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard after both teams were eliminated from the playoffs.

I haven't watched the Bulls enough (despite having Vuc, Caruso, DJJ and Javonte on my fantasy team—I had Patrick before he went down and picked up DJJ/Javonte when I saw the news) but I'm assuming with Caruso, Javonte/Dosunmu, Lonzo and Lavine that they are running somewhat of a 3 guard set with DeMar guarding 4's? There's no way all five of those guys are averaging 25+ minutes a game without someone logging minutes at the 4."
Why would Phily ever trade Seth? He arguably has the best contract in the league.  Unless it is actually Damian Lillard coming back..
"Pretty sure that's not actually John Hollinger performing the analysis but rather an algorithm that's just spewing outputs based on inputs like Damian ""Below Average PER"" Lillard is not being great for winning basketball games."
I feel like Blazers fans are frustrated with any of their players not named Damian Lillard. That includes Nurkic and CJ.

"# Gravity is the defensive attention a player receives. That's the simplest definition.  &amp;#x200B;  Key aspect here: Defensive attention. There are no other qualifiers. It can be by ball handlers and guards such as Damian Lillard, or big men like Giannis. I'll give examples below and explain why Steph has so much gravity.  &amp;#x200B;  Examples:  Gravity is when say a ballhandler like Dame, runs around a screen, and TWO defenders come at him. Not one, but two. His scoring threat and shooting threat is massive so his ""Gravity"" is sucking up the attention of the defense. Defenders don't want Dame having a good shot, so they stick with him no matter what. Because 2 guys are going at Dame, somebody else is being left open.  Another example, gravity is when Giannis drives into the lane and 2-3 defenders come at him. He's a physical specimen, and he cannot be given an easy chance to drive, so his ""gravity"" sucks the attention of the defense. Because 2-3 guys are going at Giannis, somebody is being left open. An open shot in the NBA is incredibly powerful, which is why gravity is so important.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  The reason you hear ""Gravity"" with Steph so much is because he has the largest gravity. This is for 3 reasons.   1) He is probably the best offensive player in the league. Defenses are insanely scared of his scoring, so his ""Gravity"" sucks defenders away from others because they want to stop his scoring.  2) He is by far the best shooter in the league and the greatest shooter of all time. Because he can shoot from so far away, defenses have to follow him no matter what, even if he's at the logo or sometimes even at the other side of the half court, he gets double teamed. His ""Gravity"" sucks defenders away from others because he can shoot so far away. This is tied to his offensive output.  3) He runs without the ball (off-ball) more than any player. This is what makes him special and it's tied again to the offensive output. He is constantly moving and running, and because defenses want to double him, it's just insanely hard to keep track of him. His potent offense forces defenders follow him everywhere, even off-ball, which makes his gravity way stronger. His ""Gravity"" forces defenders to keep up with him at all times. No other player in the league is like this, which is why you hear it most with Steph. A lot, possibly most offensive players just sit there and wait to get the ball back, which minimizes their ""Gravity.""  &amp;#x200B;  Gravity doesn't just have to be in shooting and scoring. Playmaking gravity is also a thing. A defense could be worried about a player like Chris Paul's playmaking gravity, so they're overselling on the passing lanes, which can mess up the defense. Same with guys like Jokic and Lebron. Gravity is just defensive attention.   The defensive attention can be super subtle. Forcing another defender to look at the guy with gravity who isn't his man for 1 extra second can lead to the defenders man getting an extra step when driving to the rim. Gravity also comes into play with how defenders treat the PnR, whether they go over because the offensive player cannot have space, or they go under, because it doesn't matter if the offensive player has space.   Players who don't pose a strong offensive threat, such as driving or shooting, don't have much gravity. Defenders simply don't care that much about that player, and they care more about their more offensively potent teammates.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;    # TLDR: Gravity is the defensive attention a player receives."
"Derrick rose’s 2 prime years were amazing though. Damian Lillard has never reached that height. Dame has never rivaled lebron as best player in the game or had his team as a serious contender.   Just cause rose got hurt, I’m not just gonna forget that I witnessed his incredible talent.   Some human beings get hurt, some get sick, some die early etc… that’s life.   Jimi Hendrix died within 3 years of his first album. Doesn’t mean a guitarist who was active for 40 years was better than him."

Is it time to be worried about Damian Lillard?
Used to be Jokic although his stans seemed to have chilled out lately.   Now it's probably Damian Lillard. Just a lot of hype for a lot of someone whose biggest achievement is getting swept in the conference finals.
"Lol this is r/nba, we criticise people like skip bayless and shannon sharpe, but we’re no better. Everything is over exaggerated to cause drama.

At the end of the season, all those guys I mentioned will finish stronger than Russ. Point is, they’ve played like 6 games in an entirely new team and Russ is struggling, those other guys are playing in more comfortable roles with the same teams, they should be doing better than Russ but they’re not. I haven’t seen posts with those guys stats making it to the top of the page with awards, you might ask why, and the answers simple. It’s the lakers, they’re title contenders, everyone likes to shit on the lakers and lebron, so full circlejerk."

"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."

"ATLANTA – As the Mavericks-Hawks controversial finish unfolded, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban sent a scathing tweet about NBA officiating. Then another. Then several more.  By the time reporters were allowed into the Mavericks’ locker room following Dallas’ 111-107 loss to Atlanta, Cuban appeared to have somewhat calmed.  Then, though, a reporter asked a question about overturned goaltend call reversal and allowed put-back basket with 8.4 seconds left that accounted for the Hawks’ final margin. Well, it didn’t take Cuban long to get wound up again.  Despite a cold that left his voice raspy, Cuban expounded on his earlier tweets. In short, he went scorched Earth on what he believes is a decades-long broken referee training system that, in his opinion, has left the league in a worse officiating state than it was in 2002, when he got fined $500,000 for saying that director of officiating Ed Rush wasn’t fit to manage a Dairy Queen.  Here is Cuban’s tirade:  Q: What were you told on the court?  Cuban: ""One of the refs told one of the players it was an inadvertent whistle that came after the put-back – but everybody who was watching it said it came before the put-back.  “That’s neither here nor there because if it’s a goaltend and then it’s an inadvertent whistle, you stop play. But then they went and reviewed it. And they reviewed it for a goaltend. So either you can’t review it because it’s an inadvertent whistle, or you review it and it’s a goaltend, the play stops right there, unless there’s something I don’t know, and that’s always possible, but I’ve never seen anything like that.”  Q: But no other explanation was given to you? I asked Rick, ‘What explanation was given to you?’ and he said, ‘Not sufficient.’  Cuban: ""No, it was ridiculous. Look, it’s gotten worse. That’s why I tweeted. I’ve gone a year and a half, or more, without commenting on the officials, and it’s just gotten progressively worse.  ""It goes back, like I just tweeted, you’ve got Ronnie Nunn, who . . . only hired people from the Ohio Valley Conference or wherever his buddies worked at. Including a former Rucker League ref who lasted only a year. And so we’re paying the price that his hiring and training was so bad that we don’t have any good refs.  “And so then we went to Don Vaden, who was here two or three years. Then you went to Bob Delaney, who wanted you to go take these vitamins and go to these brain doctors and kind of forced the refs to try to do that [expletive], so we have lots of former police officers. And so out of a million refs around the world, we have this incestuous group of refs that we’ve hired, literally brothers, spouses. I don’t know which came first, the hiring or the spousing. But same high school, same cities, and then when it comes to training we sign Joey and Bennett and Wunderlich, all these guys who were former refs and go around and, according to refs I’ve talked to, spent minimal time doing video training with them.”  ""Pop in, pop out. But that’s not really the problem. Because we’ve had such poor training, when some of the older refs retired, the ones that come and take their place are not ready. And why are they not ready? Because we had one guy running all the G-League training, George Tolliver, I think that’s who it is. One guy running all the G-League training and very little support.  ""So by the time they get here, if they’re not good enough already, you ain’t all of a sudden going to make them better. And I’ve said that to the league a dozen times. They said, ‘We’re going to work on it, we’re going to work on it, they’re going to work on it, we’re improving it.’ Yet, instead of having people who know how to train and develop refs, that are professional trainers, that learn from refs on mechanics and everything of what they want, we get Joey Crawford, who gets dressed up. Bennett Savatore, who gets dressed up.  ""Let’s see if they go to the Maine Redclaws and spend all the time there, where they should be. That’s what I’ve been saying. If these guys are such good training refs, send them down to the G-League and let them spend time with the refs before they get here, not after they get here. Because by the time they get here, we’re paying the price because they’re getting on the job training that wins and loses games.  ""And I’m not saying it’s all against the Mavs. It’s just in general, this is a training issue. This is a management issue. Is it as bad as back in Dairy Queen? It literally could be worse.  ""Because at least they had Darrell Garretson refs. When you look at their longevity and you look at the guys who made it to the Finals, whatever Darrell Garretson was doing to training, that was the right way to do it. Since then, I mean literally Ronnie Nunn would hire people who worked for his coach. He hired a guy who used a fake name, without checking . . . who’s gone to jail for fraud. The ridiculous stuff that we’ve done, and just repeat over and over and over.  ""I get it, look, the league doesn’t care who wins and loses games. That’s the way it should be. But the definition of insanity . . . So you have in the last 12 years, Ronnie Nunn, Don Vaden, Bob Delaney and now Monty McCutchen, all doing the exact same (expletive).  Q: How was tonight any different than the Damian Lillard play (second game of Mavs’ season when referees called a jump ball after the coach’s review)?  Cuban: ""That’s the whole point. It’s supposed to be the same. And it may have even been a 24-second violation. We couldn’t tell if he blocked the ball into the rim.  ""It would be one thing if we were making positive progress. But we’re not.  “Out of the 70 refs, give or take, I think I counted 17 that have five years or less experience. That’s a lot. And you can’t expect new refs to be any good. And that’s because we do such a horrific job of training in the G-League. Not a poor job. Not a marginal job. We apply literally no resources. The Joey Crawfords and Bennett Salvatores, I’m so glad I can call those guys out, because they’re awful at their jobs.”"
It also essentially cost us Damian Lillard

"58% true shooting is good but not amazingly high, especially against college defenses. And an assist to turnover ratio of 1.6 to 1 is also kind of mixed. And he had lots of points and assists but also a massive usage rate of almost 40%.   He was an excellent prospect but there were significant question marks around how well his game would translate. He is also really small. Small guys often struggle a lot against the length and athleticism of the NBA. Among recent players only Steph, Chris Paul, Irving and Damian Lillard have managed to be elite and around his size. And he’s even smaller than all those guys except for maybe Paul.  He was usually compared to Steph. But in a less efficient era Steph had 60-64% TS and much better advanced stats. Steph had a WS/40 of 0.35 in college compared to Trae’s 0.20. And Steph himself needed several years of improvement to become really good.  Even with all that he was the 5th pick, which is pretty high. And I think he deserves credit for just straight up improving his game every year. His TS% is actually higher now against NBA defenses than it was in college."

"&gt;Patrick Beverly will guard Damian Lillard  This is admittedly out of date, it was true a few years ago, but I couldn't think of as obvious of an example that demonstrated the point.  &gt;so you want positions to be based on someone's height and weight   Obviously not lol, that's a horrible representation of physical profile. It's a nuanced thing, height, weight, weight distribution, wingspan, speed, lateral quickness, horizontal quickness, vertical reach, footwork, deceleration, and a million other things go into it. The best example I can think of is Keldon Johnson who is listed at 6'5"", 220 lbs, and yet he looked fine at PF this year because he's stronger than his weight would suggest and knows how to use his body to defend taller players effectively."
"What do Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale have in common when it comes to their offensive role? Standing in the (weakside) corner.  Who was assigned to guard them when they played Portland? Damian Lillard.  Mikal Bridges and Royce O'Neale were also the primary defenders assigned to guarding Dame.  Who was assigned to guard Mikal and Royce when they played Dallas? Luka Doncic.  That doesn't make Lillard a SF. It doesn't make Mikal a PG. That's because Luka and Dame have the same role on defence -- *stand vaguely near the weakside corner shooter and theoretically help on drives, but ideally take a break.*   Lillard doesn't pressure opposing ball-handlers all game long. PatBev does it a lot. Rubio does it sometimes. They have very different defensive roles because they have different skills and play in different schemes.  You're idealising things to the point where they no longer real relation to reality. Fine. You do you. But as useless as positions in the NBA of today, at least on offence the PG position is as well defined as any -- bring the ball over half court, run the largest chunk of PnRs, decide where the ball goes.  At the end of the day the only person for whom it matters who plays at which position is the head coach of that team. That's why positions exists -- so the coach can more efficiently organise players into a cohesive whole. And Carlisle was adamant Luka plays PG as far as he's concerned, and he was the only one whose opinion on the matter mattered."
"I couldn't disagree more.  How is it that guys like Damian Lillard, Patrick Beverly, and Ricky Rubio are all listed as PGs despite having almost nothing in common in terms of offensive role, but guys like Lillard, Harden, and Lebron are all listed at different positions, despite filling the same general roles on offense? Because position and offensive role don't correlate at all.  Given how fluid offensive roles are nowadays, with there being players described as ""point centers,"" If the traditional ""PG/SG/SF/PF/C"" position model is going to be useful *at all,* it *has* to be a short hand for defensive lineups and match ups. Not just who you guard, but who best guards you as well. If literally no PG can guard you, but SFs, can, then it sounds like you're more of an SF to me."

4th quarter Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard. He’s relevant today but in 10 years he’s just a guy that shot the ball from half court but never really won anything.
Damian Lillard
"That's why some athletes and rappers just stick to being with the girls who liked them before they had money or fame. Like Damian Lillard, Mahomes, J.cole, Kendrick Lamar etc."
I understand your overall point but disregarding a layup which wasn't a realistic shot in that scenario...this shot chart says top of the key would have been the place you wanted him to shoot from or even the left corner: https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=damian+lillard+shot+chart+2019-2020+season
Not unless they can swap him for Damian Lillard. They simply are not gonna be contenders until they can get a high level half court guard or wing.
Dawg after he signed with the Nets last year or retired he said his biggest regret was not returning to Portland to join Damian Lillard.
DAMIAN LILLARD IS THE BEST DEFENSIVE PG IN THE GAME. haha jk. BUT he is better than he used to be.
"The only way a Portland trade makes sense for Blazers is if they can somehow keep Dame. But latest news is Blazers [aren't even interested in a CJ deal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/trail-blazers-concerned-about-teaming-ben-simmons-with-damian-lillard/ar-AAO2vAx)! So... umm, good luck Portland."
"Wizards won't as long as Beal's happy. That can change in eighteen months, but it's not a Damian Lillard situation at least."
"CJ McCollum has averaged 28.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.0 rebounds in 33 games without Damian Lillard in his career."
"The idea that Philly's interest was going to get Damian Lillard, the most loyal guy in the league, to ask out of Portland when he hadn't yet was transparently dumb from jump."
"Fascinating, but the weirdest thing to me is how high Damian Lillard is on that list. Who doesn't like Damian Lillard?"
Keeping Ben away from basketball will somehow raise his price to Damian Lillard... somehow.
"Who would the Wolves trade for Simmons if they're keeping all those dudes? Simmons can't shoot, which yes is a problem as far as potential ceiling, but aside from that he's above average everywhere else.      Don't see why Philly would make a garbage trade. Trade Harris and Simmons for Damian Lillard and another piece that's not CJ. Both teams win in that scenario I think"

Warriors: Ben Simmons  Blazers: Jevon Carter and a 2nd  Nets: Damian Lillard and Steph Curry
Simmons is getting all kinds of praise all the time from all star selections that he doesn’t deserve to huge contracts. He’s highly overrated. Especially since morey thinks he can get Damian Lillard for him.
"&gt;Again, Damian Lillard isn’t for trade. Damian Lillard hasn’t asked for a trade. Portland isn’t under pressure to trade him because his market is drying up.   Really? No shit. Never knew that.  I'm obviously asking about if he requested a trade, which he hasn't done ""yet"" in his words"
"Again, Damian Lillard isn’t for trade. Damian Lillard hasn’t asked for a trade. Portland isn’t under pressure to trade him because his market is drying up.   Dame is a top 9 - 13(?) player, depending on your ranking. He will have plenty of suitors."
"I can't think of many teams that could beat the Warriors offer. If I'm the Blazers I don't want Knicks players. I'd also stay away from Ben Simmons. I wouldn't want any Boston player whose name doesn't start with Jay, and I doubt Boston would trade Brown. So how many teams are left who would throw away their futures for Damian Lillard?"
"I'm curious. Do people think Simmons is a better fit on the Warriors than Damian Lillard, and would give them a better chance at a title?"

"&gt;  &gt; Sources: Ben Simmons tells team brass he no longer wants to be a Sixer and does not intend to report to training camp &gt;  &gt; Keith Pompey August 31, 2021 &gt;  &gt; Ben Simmons let it be known that he wants out. &gt;  &gt; In a meeting with the 76ers last week in Los Angeles, Simmons told team co-managing partner Josh Harris, president of basketball operations Daryl Morey, general manager Elton Brand and coach Doc Rivers that he no longer wants to remain a Sixer, according to multiple sources. &gt;  &gt; Sources said the three-time All-Star also does not intend to report to training camp. &gt;  &gt; For the second time since December, the Sixers are unsuccessfully trying to trade Simmons, whose trade value has diminished. At the beginning of this past season, they tried to send him to the Houston Rockets in exchange for James Harden. The Rockets ultimately traded Harden to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 11. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers are having a tough time finding a team to meet their lofty trade demands. &gt;  &gt; The organization does not want to trade Simmons for less than what it believes is fair market value. The four told Simmons they wanted him to report to the start of training camp on Sept. 28 and be a part of the team. &gt;  &gt; The source said, however, the Sixers’ inability to get fair market value isn’t Simmons’ fault. &gt;  &gt; Another source said there’s no shortage of teams still interested, but the problem is Morey is demanding a king’s ransom. &gt;  &gt; Simmons is fully aware the Sixers can fine him for holding out and failing to show up to training camp. But a source said money will not play a role in the decision-making for Simmons, who has four years and $147 million remaining on his deal. &gt;  &gt; Plus, fining Simmons could strain the Sixers’ relationship with his super agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. Paul has a who’s who of clients — players the Sixers might be interested in pursuing down the road in free agency. &gt;  &gt; When asked specifically whether he thought Simmons would come back at all, a source responded “no,” resolutely. &gt;  &gt; None of this should come as a surprise. &gt;  &gt; As The Inquirer noted on July 26, if Simmons really wants out, he could opt to be disruptive or not show up for training camp. The tactic has worked for many elite professional athletes across sports who want to be traded. &gt;  &gt; On Aug. 9, ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins said Simmons is willing to hold out of training camp as long as it takes to get traded. &gt;  &gt; Time will tell if the 25-year-old reports and/or if the team avoids what is bound to be a circus-like atmosphere by trading him in the weeks leading up to camp. &gt;  &gt; The belief around the league is the Sixers have been holding out for six-time All-NBA point guard Damian Lillard to request a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. But Lillard said, “I’m not leaving [Portland] — not right now at least” on Wednesday during an Instagram Live stream. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers’ best consolation could be circling back to the Blazers for a potential deal involving shooting guard CJ McCollum before the start of training camp. That trade would make sense for both teams. &gt;  &gt; In addition to fulfilling needs, the players have similar salaries. Simmons will make $33 million next season, while McCollum will receive $30.8 million. &gt;  &gt; The problem is both teams might think they should get more in return. &gt;  &gt; McCollum, 29, has averaged 18.9 points while shooting 38.9% on 3-pointers in 528 career games with 431 starts. However, the eight-year veteran out of Lehigh is not an All-Star after years of playing in the tough Western Conference. &gt;  &gt; Even still, he could be the best option and a good pickup right before training camp with all things considered. &gt;  &gt; League sources believe the Sixers will have a tough time getting what they perceive as fair market value under the circumstances. &gt;  &gt; “Think about three months ago when the Sixers are willing to give up Ben Simmons. You are like, ‘Let’s see what we have to do to get him,’” said a Western Conference executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Now, the difference is Ben Simmons says he refuses to play for the Sixers. He wants to go to three California teams. There’s so much bad blood between him and the team.” &gt;  &gt; The executive said teams are not willing to give in to the Sixers’ steep asking price knowing they have to move Simmons. &gt;  &gt; “The kid said he’s not going back,” the executive said. “I’m not giving you what you’re demanding. They really messed this up.” &gt;  &gt; A source believes the devaluing of Simmons began with Rivers’ postgame comments following the Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals on June 20. &gt;  &gt; That’s when the coach, who has been one of Simmons’ biggest supporters and defenders, was asked by The Inquirer’s David Murphy if the standout is still capable of being a point guard on a championship-caliber team. &gt;  &gt; “I don’t know the answer to that right now,” Rivers responded on a night when Simmons finished with five points, 13 assists, eight rebounds and was sidelined the final 40 seconds of the 103-96 loss. &gt;  &gt; He attempted just four shots, making two. For the fourth straight game, Simmons did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter. He played timid, appearing fearful to go to the foul line. &gt;  &gt; That became apparent with 3 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and the Sixers trailing, 88-86. He drove to the basket past Danilo Gallinari, but passed up an open dunk underneath the basket, dishing the ball to Matisse Thybulle, who was fouled by John Collins. Thybulle made one of two free throws. &gt;  &gt; The day after wavering, Rivers did say that Simmons is salvageable. He said the Sixers would put together the right type of offseason workout plan to help correct Simmons’ shooting deficiencies. But a source said Simmons has not participated in a Sixers offseason workout plan. &gt;  &gt; The source believes it will be tough for Simmons to have a working relationship with the team moving forward. At the same time, the team isn’t trying to let their multifaceted player go for little in return. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers would definitely have a lot of holes to fill by getting rid of Simmons. &gt;  &gt; In addition to being the point guard, Simmons is a two-time NBA All-Defensive player, a third-team All-NBA selection, a small-ball center and reserve power forward. &gt;  &gt; Can one envision Simmons returning to the Sixers for two months just to raise his trade value? And with all the heat he’ll likely receive from Sixers fans, he might benefit from a change of scenery."
"A *POINT GUARD* with **NO JUMPER** is worth Damian Lillard? NO! Now, on the other hand if they offered CJ Mcollum and they say no, you're smoking. They can use Simmons like Draymond and just steal all those Golden State plays. Hell, it's only fair. Billups is head coach and those same elevator plays are what made Rip Hamilton famous."
"&gt;Sixers looking at Damian Lillard  I too am looking at Kevin Durant for my rec team. In return I have offered Kevin beers after the game, and will pay Brooklyn $100."
The Sixers aren't getting a Damian Lillard talent for Ben Simmons &amp; no one wants to play in Minnesota.   I feel like this is all nonsense. The Blazers don't want to give up Lillard. The Sixers have to move Simmons &amp; overvalue him. The Wolves don't have the assets.
&gt;Philadelphia has its eyes set on Portland All-NBA guard Damian Lillard  good luck lmao. if youre portland that's a huge downgrade no?
Dude teams will certainly take Ben at the salary he has but ain't nobody trading 4 1sts or damian Lillard unless it's pure desperation.  This sub is too often all or nothing thinking.
&gt; [Charania] Ben Simmons' stint in Philadelphia all but over; Sixers looking at Damian Lillard  Too bad the rest of the league disagrees.
"""Simmons and the Sixers org have had a falling out, Sixers are looking to trade him but will not move him without significant return and are willing to hold out for a good deal, Sixers are very interested in Damian Lillard, Timberwolves are very interested in Ben Simmons""  I feel like I have heard dozens of different variations of this exact same information for the last 2 months. Was there anything new in this article?"
"&gt;Look at the Harden trade - Rockets didn't get anyone back to build around.  2 things wrong with this  1. Rockets gave up their 2024 and 2026 picks to the Thunder in the Westbrook trade so that is why they had took the Nets deal which replenished. Portland has all their draft picks except 2022 which is lottery protected until 2028 so they dont need a pick centered package 2. Everyone litterally says that the Harden trade was awful and the Rockets made a mistake lol  Portland can get back a bunch of picks if they trade all of CJ,Nurkic,Powell,Covington and Nance but from a Damian Lillard trade they need a star they can build around like Brandon Ingram or Jaylen Brown"
I would like to announce that the Los Angeles Lakers are also looking at Damian Lillard
"First of all OKC would have to agree to do it and they have reasons not to do it. Unprotecting that pick means that Philadelphia is a better team and can thus make the pick they recieve from them even worse, a top 8 and then top 6 protected first round pick without Lillard sounds better than a unprotected first with Damian Lillard  Also lets say you do manage to unprotect that pick, adding an extra first and a swaps that likely wont convert is still not enough for Lillard"
"Sixers looking at Damian Lillard, Blazers also looking at Damian Lillard"
Ok I’m just gonna spell this out for Daryl Morey in plain simple English: YOU’RE NOT GETTING DAMIAN LILLARD YOU STUPID FUCK!
Which is why they're trying to trade him for the low price of Damian Lillard 🙄🙄

"“Sixers looking at Lillard” is such click bait by shams lol  &gt; Philadelphia has its eyes set on Portland All-NBA guard Damian Lillard, sources say, but the Trail Blazers have fully focused on continuing to build around Lillard. As of now, Lillard is continuing to evaluate the Trail Blazers’ present and future and is slated to begin training camp with the organization. In some ways, the 76ers are stuck between deciding whether to make a move now with Simmons — or waiting until a star like Lillard shakes free."

"I think you should consider **Damian Lillard** for shooters, while he isn’t a catch and shoot shooter like the others, and he does the vast vast majority of his work on-ball, he’s still one of the greatest shooters ever, one of the few approaching Curry in some statistics- for example Dame is the best deep shooter of all time, as evidenced by his last two to three years where he contains to push further and further out.  He’s also incredibly automatic at the line, like other great shooters, his TS% is still great as he gets to the line well and converts his looks, and he is one of the highest volume three point shooters ever, being the one to take the highest ratio off the bounce with a defender on him rather than creating looks offball through the offense.    Like obviously Curry is better than Lillard, but beyond that?  I’d take Dame Time with the game on the line and the clock running out before anyone else, he’s up there with MJ for the most clutch shots and Dame has some incredibly iconic shots and moments as a shooter- half court franchise destroying buzzer beaters, the works."
Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard  without question.   I deeply respect his loyalty to the city / team but I’m also kind of glad it’s gotten a little messy there because we need to see him on a proper loaded playoff run.
"I went looking through the advanced stats, focusing on the top 30 single season rankings for PER, Total Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus and VORP. A couple folks jump into the All-time Top 25 conversation.   I was a bit surprised at how many top notch regular seasons Kawhi has had-- I tend to think of him as a playoff monster. But he's a dominant contender for bursting into the all-time ranks. And Giannis is already coming on strong, too:  **Kawhi Leonard (2017 &amp; 2021 PER, 2019 Win Shares, 2016, 2017 &amp; 2021 Box Plus/Minus, 2019 VORP)**  **Giannis (2020 PER, 2020 Box Plus/Minus, 2021 VORP)**  Chris Paul, Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis each have had dominant years that could be considered top 25 all-time:   **Chris Paul (2008 PER, 2008 Box Plus/Minus)**  **Damian Lillard (2021 PER, 2021 Box Plus/Minus)**  **Anthony Davis (2020 PER, 2020 Win Shares)**  I'm not sure if Dirk Nowitzi and Dwayne Wade are already considered top 25 all-time, but based on their dominant year in 2006, they probably should be:  **Dirk Nowitzki (2006 Win Shares, 2010 Box Plus/Minus, 2006 VORP)**  **Dwayne Wade (2006 Win Shares, 2010 Box Plus/Minus, 2006 VORP)**  But all of those folks are probably not big surprises, and will probably be in the top 25 debate eventually, if they're not already. The one that I think really forces his way into the conversation is Anfernee Hardaway, who had a dominant year in 1997:  **Anfernee Hardaway (1997 PER, 1997 Box Plus/Minus)**  There were other players who had dominant years in these categories, but not appearing in the top 30 in more than one category. Unless you count George Mikan, but I know most of you don't..."

Only 17 players have ever averaged 25ppg on 56 ts% in their playoff career. Damian Lillard is one of them.
"it is hilarious because the same people that are vastly overinflating the importance of Nance and this list of mediocrity, are the same ones that diminish the value of irving, pippen, rodman, manu, etc. in those teams.   if you don't want damian lillard on your team, feel free. but i know for sure i wish he was on my team."

What about other era specific advantages Kobe had? Defensive 3 second rule is a big one that Damian Lillard said made international play harder. Handchecking as well of course.
So do you count the Damian Lillard injury for the Lakers run or nah?
Fine by me. I don't want him traded so I hope his value is either one Damian Lillard or absolute zero.

"That's what he put up this season, outside of a clearly injured stretch that completely tanked his stats   Averaged 31/8 on 65 TS% for 50 games this season, outside of when he got [injured against the Mavs](https://www.nba.com/news/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-suffers-ankle-injury-vs-dallas-mavericks) (source because people always think injuries are made up for some reason) and averaged 22/7 on 53% TS% for 15 games, which obviously isn't Dame. Dude got back healthy and went right back to 31/8  Also this playoffs he was at 66% TS% - and if you really really really disagree with ignoring that injured stretch, he was still at 30/8 on 63% TS% last season  Dame just plays through injuries instead of sitting out because he's stubborn.

"nothing wrong with that. Damian Lillard will make well over half a billion dollars by the time his career comes to an end. He's got at least 7 more years to go, maybe more. His next major contract is likely to pay him something close to probably 250 million dollars for the duration.. which would bring his career earnings to nearly 600 million dollars before we know what kind of endorsement money he has made, is making, and will make in the future.  He's a fool to stick with Portland from a basketball perspective, but over half a billion to play basketball is a hell of a W. Never gonna get that ring though smh. I guess he can dry his tears with million dollar bills 😂"
"Damian Lillard seemed to bust right out of the gate as, at worst, an upper tier starting point guard."
I have no idea where you found a 28-32 foot stat but that year he shot over 39% from 30-40 feet.  The link below covered it at the time and there's a shot chart Goldsberry tweeted which shows all of his shots within that range. Many are well beyond 30 feet.   If you've got links to back up your claims go for it. I don't think there's such a huge difference between 37 and 34 feet though. Dame was very confident from super long range and continued to be very effective on those shots after the 2019 season.  https://hoopshype.com/2019/04/24/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-37-feet-deep-three-pointers/

"OP's inspiration, since it's removed now:  [Paul George has a higher career playoff true shooting percentages then Damian Lillard](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pann4f/paul_george_has_a_higher_career_playoff_true/)  &gt;Paul George often gets the reputation for being a Playoff choker while Lillard is seen as being clutch or elevating his game, however, throughout their playoff careers, Paul George has a higher true percentage of 56.2% to Damian Lillard’s 56.1%.  &gt;Now the difference isn’t that big or even noticeable but it just highlights how people find a narrative and stick to it with reality often telling a different story.

Compare their shot charts   [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/damian-lillard-shot-chart](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/damian-lillard-shot-chart)   [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/paul-george-shot-chart](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/paul-george-shot-chart)  PG takes way more shots and shoots more accurately from the wing. Dame takes many more shots and shoots more accurately from the top of the key.    Dame is the Point Guard, primary shot creator and best shot maker for his team. Portland positions primarily have him at the top of the key, creating shots for others or himself.   PG is a small forward, and not the primary creator or best shot maker on his team. Since he left Indiana (and even in Indiana to a large extent) his teams' have used him on the wing, kicking out to him once there's an opportunity or asking him to create for himself on the wing.   If you think the roles are even close to being similar, you're delusional."
But Dame clearly isn't a wing player lol   Look at their shot charts:    [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/damian-lillard-shot-chart](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/damian-lillard-shot-chart)    [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/paul-george-shot-chart](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/paul-george-shot-chart)
Nuggets trade Murray + Multiple FRP for Damian Lillard around December.  Atlanta gets the 2 seed and Trae is MVP.  Zion declines the max extension and takes the QO at the end of the year.

"&gt;This is the analogy I'm looking at rn   &gt;Trae is Curry, Tatum is PG   &gt;Curry is better than PG   &gt;Hence Trae is better than Tatum   This logic is incredible. It is truly amazing.   &gt;In fact I'm being ultra-generous to Tatum giving him the defense of PG   You're being out-of-the-universe generous giving Trae the offense or defense of Curry. He isn't in the same hemisphere at either.   This is so disrespectful to Curry.   What happen to your comparison if I give Tatum the offense and defense of KD?   What if I give Trae the offense and defense of  Damian Lillard?   KD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lillard   Therefore, Tatum &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trae, right?   &gt;Trae ... just needs to be average on defense   He is one of the biggest defensive liabilities in the NBA. Its extremely unlikely that he ever becomes average.    &gt;Tatum has not been improving on anything what so ever   Holy shit, this post just gets funnier."

"This is talked about too much, and the Kings picking Thomas Robinson over Damian Lillard has never been talked about enough"
Honestly they might have.  The story around that trade is that Portland wasn't actively shopping Wallace and got a call out of the blue from Billy King who was trying desperately to put pieces around Deron Williams.  The offer was crazy enough they'd probably still do it even if they were a contender as they had already been scouting Damian Lillard and needed a PG themselves.

"I was downvoted for this take a couple weeks ago so I guess it's controversial. Damian Lillard is one of the more hotly-debated picks to be in the NBA top 75 list but he deserves to be on that list a hell of a lot more than Pete Maravich does. This isn't just some ""modern guy is better than old guy"" take - Maravich's career compared even to his contemporaries wasn't anything that would blow you away. His peak was very short-lived and he never did shit in the playoffs.   Lillard has twice as many career win shares as Maravich does. Maravich's BBref similarity scores include guys like Ty Lawson (who nobody would even think of arguing deserves a top 75 spot) and Bradley Beal (who is still only 28 and will blow past that Maravich comp by the time his career is done)."
"There's a whole generation of guards that I hate just because at some point some pundit, or analyst, or rando on this site said was better than Dame.   Kyrie Irving, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, to name a few. Most of these dudes are good guys and very fun to watch, but a part of me loves seeing them have a bad game in the pettiest way, because I know that at some point someone said with a straight face that they were a better player than Damian Lillard. These days Dame usually gets the respect he deserves, but like pre-2019 everybody was trying to act their favorite player was actually better than Dame because of some stupid shit and I still hate those players, just a little bit, because of it."

"Lol ok man. I’m not really sure how that is particularly relevant to the very specific scenario we are discussing here.  I am intimately familiar with Oakland, and spent extensive time in that area growing up, and went to high school around the same time as Damian Lillard, played sports against Oakland high and various other teams in the area. I know people to this day that play in runs with Lillard when he is in the bay.  That doesn’t just somehow give me some magical insight to be able to confidently declare what I find “likely” or “unlikely” some dude I’ve never met was getting up to when he was a teenager.  I’m not sure why you think it’s like some crazy unrealistic scenario that a guy who plays ball with a ton of aggression and emotion might have gotten into a scrap or two on the court growing up. Especially when we’re \*checks notes\* *literally in a thread about a scenario where he got a tech for squaring up with a dude* lmao.   There’s a big gap between being some hardened criminal who brawled with fools every day of their life or whatever ridiculous strawman you brought up in your comment and getting into a couple scraps on the blacktop growing up.

I'm a big fan of Damian Lillard tbh.

Damian Lillard
"Also we already changed our general manager, whose first two picks have been Tyrese Haliburton (an obvious BPA who’s looking like a great offensive player) and Davion Mitchell (a player questioned at first but whose defense has been able to give Damian Lillard an opening night where he missed every three pointer he took)"
"Damian Lillard is actually a dementor from Harry Potter, and is slowly sucking the skill out of Westbrook every time they play."

"As a scoring guard playing second fiddle to his point guard, yeah, he gets passes, doesn't usually need to make them. He's got tunnel vision but you might too if you were passed a ball and told to shoot by Damian Lillard."

It’s Donovan’s fault that he decided to trap Ricky Rubio but not Damian Lillard. Also not going small against Houston twice was stupid
https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html  I know what I said. Folks wanna downvote me but it’s cool. Here the receipts
"Entire team's second jump speed improves 30% in a week leading to an increase in putback shots. Kings increase average scoring by 11% per game and get more defensive rebounds keeping opposing teams down a few easy buckets a game. Morale grows as they reach 5 seed by all-star break and end up the 3 seed by playoffs. They ultimately win a long series against the Mavericks when it comes down to a game 7 layup attempt over Luka Doncic. Bagley blows a layup over Doncic because of course he does. Marvin comes down just as Doncic goes up for the rebound, and then it happens  Vlade shows up with a stereo blaring ""The Final Countdown""  Doncic rises but it's too late, Marvin Bagley the Third is already springing past him from his second jump, gathering his own rebound and tipping his shot in  The basketball world erupts. Doncic is exposed as a fraud and the 2018 #2 overall draft pick has defeated the imposter and claimed his place in history. Vlade is vindicated, tears steaming down his face. Kings fans rejoice - there is nothing that can slow this momentum. Ultimate victory is within their grasp, if only they just take it.    Kings are then swept in the second round by the Portland Trailblazers led by Damian Lillard and Ben Simmons"
"The Lakers and Clippers used to be a big reason the West was considered strong. The first has turned out to be an ass team and the latter lacks Kawhi. Damian Lillard is also underperforming.   Look at the teams outside the playoffs in the East. They still got Bucks, Hawks, and Celtics. Once they get their sht together it's clearly favoring the East."

"Chill, ""only be a better Damian Lillard"" at the minimum would be the best PG in the league."
"Damian Lillard  Also, the media seems to overrate him too. How the fuck he in the top 75."
"OBPM is a box-score derived stat. Is Damian Lillard a better offensive player than Bird? Is Barkey a better offensive player than Chris Paul? Barkley &gt; Shaq? If you believe everything that this stat entails then I cant argue with you because then atleast youre consistent, but if you dont then you're just picking and choosing. Kobe is better than Dirk in essentially every aspect of the game minus of course shooting and rebounding."
"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.	Stephen Curry	6.23   4.	Kevin Durant	6.03   5.	James Harden	5.95   6.	Magic Johnson\*	5.93   7.	Damian Lillard	5.48   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.35   9.	Chris Paul	5.18   10.	Larry Bird\*	5.12   11.	John Stockton\*	4.90   12.	Kyrie Irving	4.83   13.	Tracy McGrady\*	4.69   14.	Julius Erving\*	4.64   15.	Anthony Davis	4.64   16.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.62   17.	Kawhi Leonard	4.55   18.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokić	7.45   4.	Kevin Durant	6.44   5.	Stephen Curry	6.37   6.	Tracy McGrady\*	6.17   7.	Magic Johnson\*	6.08   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.42   9.	Larry Bird\*	5.40   10.	Kawhi Leonard	5.35   11.	Julius Erving\*	5.33   12.	James Harden	5.26   13.	Giannis Antetokounmpo	5.23   14.	Chris Paul	5.23   15.	Dirk Nowitzki	5.19   16.	Damian Lillard	5.14   17.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	5.04   18.	Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."
Steph prior this season was just average. Damian Lillard is a horrible defender. Luka is neutral at best. Harden at his peak wasn’t even trying.
"Completely agreed with you. If Steph only played when the ball is in his hands, he would only be a better Damian Lillard. But he does WAY more than that."

"I'm now convinced the injuries to all our bigs was actually an ingenious ruse by Koby Altman to pump up Ed Davis's stock while we have a monopoly on all the big men, so that we can get three first rounders and Damian Lillard for him"
"Morey is so delusional  first of all he's banking on having the best offer for Damian Lillard when the best return that Portland could get for Damian Lillard would actually be Jaylen Brown which any team would take over Ben Simmons. Also Dame might actually choose to go play for a guy that's looking to bring greatness to a franchise he's been loyal too, much like how Giannis said if he left Milwaukee it would be to play in Portland with Dame. Dame would probably want to play with another lone star guard who has been far too loyal to his franchise..a guy that many know as...Bradley Beal.   Like what if Morey thinks ""Portland has to say yes"" and Dame says ""I don't want to play for Philly"" and Portland is actually on board because they'd rather have picks than Ben Simmons?  Morey better pray he can grab Fox from the Kings, it really is looking like the best possible trade for them."
"Well if the 76ers keep acting as if Ben Simmons return value is a top 15-25 player then yes, this will be a multi-year deal in which 180m rots on the bench. They're kidding themselves if they think they can get a Damian Lillard caliber type player for Simmons who literally isn't playing basketball right now lmao"
"I would take out damian lillard unless his numbers go up and put in dejounte Murray. Both players teams don't look like playoff teams.   Murray, is dropping a cool 19ppg 8rb 8ast 2.1stls.  Lillard is 20ppg 4rb 5ast 0.7 stls .  Other then that. A perfect list. Oh Booker over lillard as well. All his numbers are better"

Unless we get a Damian lillard caliber player then no.
"I'm just going to start making insane trade ideas at this point. I'm done for the season.  Let's trade Zion for Ben Simmons 3 firsts and Matisse Thybulle cause why not.   trade Ingram, Kira, Hayes, and 5 firsts for Damian Lillard.   Move the team to Baton Rouge and change the teams name to the Red Sticks."

They could trade for Damian lillard but they would have to give up 2 or 3 first round draft picks with Westbrook. Like they to have 2025 2027 and 2028 first round pick plus 2025 or 2027 second round pick plus Westbrook for Damian lillard.
When the Sixers fans were chanting for Damian Lillard a little part of me died
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Morey is fighting the wrong battle. Getting Simmons to play doesn't really do anything for his value. This guy is going to chuck up shots from everywhere on the court as soon as he gets the ball, why not just let him sit? You can still do this ""we're waiting for Damian Lillard"" pipe dream thing you guys got going on right now, but this would at least keep Ben and the sixers out of the media for a bit."

Damian Lillard.
Damian Lillard is back
"CJ ""Damian Lillard"" McCollum"
Damian lillard 100%. No chance he is making the finals
"Not bad but either way this guy will always have my appreciation for being the first person within 6 degrees of the NBA to speak the truth about this bizzare over praising of Damian Lillards music career. Why was lillard allowed to get away with this, not even shaq got this treatment"
"One of my favorites is damian lillard: 5pts on 1-13 shooting and 0-7 3pt, 18 rebounds"
I can’t even comprehend the comparison to Damian Lillard lol
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Dončić  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
"&gt; i think so, but i think the same for all top-10 level guys.  I remember Joakim Noah was top 5 in mvp voting one year. A lot of it is based on narrative. I have little doubt that Luka will win MVP one day because of how much volume stats he puts up and how great of coaching his team has.   &gt;a range or level you think luka actually is vs. what people think he is?  Last year Luka started with like 60% TS and the Mavs were like a middle of the road playoff seed team at the very start of the year. His reputation immadetly went to a top 5 MVP player and he carried a lot of that reputation for most of the year despite his efficiency cooling down and his team going down the rankings. His stock is lower than this point of the season last year. The Idea that Trae may be a comparable player wasn't even entertained but this year at least it is discussed. However, the Mavs got on a slight tear where Luka did amazing recently. I think prior to this year people thought he was a top 5 player but he is like a top 12ish player. I think he is considerably worse than those players who can play both sides of the ball like Kawhi, Lebron, Giannis, and Embiid, and he is also worse than those players that can both play make and shoot well like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard. I think he is closer to Kyrie Irving than he is to James Harden in terms of how good he is."
"Damian Lillard is a top 5 player, CJ is top 5 skilled player, GTJ is lights out, kanter is a bucket on the block, Carmelo is lowkey a most improved candidate,  Suns in 6"
"Yup, 2007-2010 Kobe was that dude. Numbers weren't the same as Lebron but he just knew how to win. I akin the comparison to today's Damian Lillard and Luka Doncic. Surely you take Doncic's numbers just on paper but Dame just knows what it takes to win better right now."
"And such is the case for Damian Lillard, Giannis, Lebron, Luka, Hoel, Steph, Kawhi etc, yet Beal is the only one"
Lillard with that shirtless suit vest thing was a charming mix of self-aware absurdity and Right Said Fred  [https://www.nba.com/blazers/forwardcenter/blazers-thoughts-damian-lillards-shirtless-suit-look](https://www.nba.com/blazers/forwardcenter/blazers-thoughts-damian-lillards-shirtless-suit-look)
"LeBron 2007 and 2009. 2007 was held against him for a long time but LeBron carrying the Cavs to the finals was seriously amazing. Bron vs Detroit was absolutely crazy.  I appreciate PGs ECF run a lot as well. Similarly Jimmy Butler in last year's finals was insanely good. He matched LeBron for 4 out of 6 games, including that one crazy game where Bron would hit every 3 and scored at legendary pace just to face Jimmy Butler doing the same while playing almost the entire game. I thought Jimmy was a winning player for a long time now but winning the battle of 40 point games against Bron with an undermanned squad is an all-time great performance in my opinion.   Jokic last season was crazy as well. He was the player that truly held the Nuggets together and brought them to the WCF.  A couple of Damian Lillard post season runs. A couple of Harden playoff runs as well as Westbrook carrying OKC past the Clippers when Durant was struggling. Prime Westbrook with KD in OKC was a reliable player that brought key buckets and defensive stops. There were many games where Brodie was the best player 2014-2016.  Tim Duncan in the early 2000s. He averaged something like 28/15/5blocks in the finals. One of the best finals performances ever period. When talking about the great 2000s playoff runs usually Shaq Wade and Bron are brought up but Timmy was just as good invidiually and not just a product of an all-time great player playing for one of the bestfranchises. Generally I believe Duncan was quite clearly the best player in the 2000s."
"Yeah, Steve Kerr is waaaay better than Damian Lillard."

holy fuck his name is Damian Lillard
That’s all-star starting guard Damian Lillard.
"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-10814/  he says this stuff because the blazers organization is paying him through 2024, he wants himself and the blazer to look like they can win without another star. He is putting the other star teams down to put himself and the organization up, and thats not a bad thing, but over the past year he has repeatedly said this same line and different forms of sentences , which has made it boring for my taste.   don't get me wrong he is a talent but damn just stfu, youre just sounding real dumb, but hi, im not here to get in a argument with a lillard fanboy im just saying my 2 cents."

For example, De’aaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he’ll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn’t good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He’s a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I’d assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."

lol Dillon talks sooooo much fucking shit for shooting poor shots and having horrible court vision.   dude thinks he damian lillard
"his assist numbers aren't even that high, but his ability to knife into the lane and fire kick-outs to the perimeter that are on time &amp; on target and his capability to make the right read consistently do mean that he's an excellent passer.  [I'm done with you, enjoy that troll lyfe](https://tenor.com/view/damian-lillard-lillard-goodbye-bye-dame-time-gif-13997094)"
"The point system is bad, like you need Kawhi + one of Siakam/Zion/Towns just to be as likely to win a title as a team with Giannis or Anthont Davis? I would argue having Kawhi is more valuable to winning a title than either of these two.  Similarly switching Kawhi Leonard for Damian Lillard changes almost nothing in your ranking, but i think that swapping Kawhi for Lillard hurts the Clippers title odds drastically.  Basically Kawhi for -200 is insane compared to the -250s, and for what you can get for Kawhi plus 100 points is probably better than lebron, ie.  Kawhi/Siakam/Towns vs Just Lebron"
"&gt;playing better is arguable.  Nah, he's definitely playing better. Dame is getting to the line though so it looks kind of comparable. Them shooting percentages say otherwise.  &gt;this blazers roster isn't better than the Warriors  Ha. This supporting cast is lackluster as it is and they haven't had a center for several games.  &gt;one game is meaningless  Not this season. The Warriors are not capable of that.   You said Damian Lillard has the same gravity as Stephen Curry. Do you watch Steph play often ?"
"It doesn't. If that's your argument, it's a terrible one.  No one gives a shit that Dame's at 39 or 40% instead of 45%.  They trap him the moment he calls for a pick because they know he's just as dangerous.   Again, do you genuinely believe that there are scenarios where teams willingly concede an open shot to damian fucking Lillard? That's insane."
Damian Lillard is A5 Wagyu that's served a la carte unfortunately
I can agree that Steph with Damian Lillard defensive attention and Damian Lillard respect from refs might average 50

Damian Lillard is a guard. What are you talking about?

"Lula Doncic is a forward, not a guard. Damian Lillard should be starting as a guard in the All-Star game"
One thing a lot of people don’t know about Damian Lillard is that he is good at playing basketball
a mutual hatred of LA is one of the things that's made it easy for me to adopt the Blazers as my mistress team (I live in PDX so they're who I get to watch).  Damian Lillard is the other major contributing factor that makes it easy to root for the Blazers

"What even does “MVP candidate” mean?  Everyone is technically an MVP candidate.  Even if you say “serious MVP candidate” I’m pretty sure there are only maybe 3 to 4 of those a season and like, has Damian Lillard ever been one?  But he’s clearly a superstar?  Mitchell is a top 20 player (with an argument for top 15) who has carried his team since his rookie year.  He has a signature shoe deal, an incredible National presence, he’s the face of the Jazz and is on a Max contract.  He’s an All-Star, a slam dunk champion, and will probably be a 2x all-star and all-nba this year.  Wild to me that that somehow doesn’t qualify as a superstar just because he’s not on a shit team where he doesn’t have to score 40 a night and/or flex other absurd stats (which he’s PROVEN he’s more than capable of) to be competitive."

"What’s stopping him from being better than someone like Damian Lillard? It’s all just reputation, someone’s who’s averaging Mitchell’s numbers and is at the seed he’s ya deserves more recognition.  I consider a superstar someone you could build your team around and that someone could also lead you to a title. Mitchell checks both boxes. 1 shot is all that separated the Jazz from beating the Nuggets."

"&gt;Lol you're using the ""product of their era"" argument, which is true, but players today ARE JUST MORE SKILLED than players were 15 years ago, so yes. It is an era thing, but 1. Curry had a lot to do with that revolution and 2. Players are just more skilled today, so the ""era"" argument proves my point. Bob Cousy is considered a top 10 PG ever, and he couldn't dribble w his left hand.  Kobe as we knew him playing today would still be more skilled overall than Curry. So I'm not just banking on the product of the era argument, I'm only saying his long range shot 3 point shot wasn't an emphasis due to the style of play at the time. (And if it were an emphasis, I'm not necessarily saying I would expect Kobe to have the range and efficiency of Curry at that deep end part of the floor).  &gt;not this season: Stephen Curry : 11-24 FG (45.8%)   &gt;Trae Young : 9-25 (36.0%)   &gt;Damian Lillard : 14-45 (31.1%)   Yeah, now how about we wait until the entire season plays on and see where that ends. Sample size matters. 42.4% off of 125 shoots is far more impressive.  &gt;Curry's shooting as good from 30-40 than Kobe shot for his career. Again, the 30 footer is the hardest shot in basketball, if a turnaround fadeaway was harder, Kobe would just take 30 footers. But he was a 33% 3PT shooter on normal 3's.  I'm not taking away from Curry's insane efficiency but it is pretty obvious you aren't aware of the type of shots Kobe took on a daily basis. For better or worse, he took ridiculous contested shots every game, and you can knock him for that. But his top tier skill set still allowed him to make those types of shots from any part of the floor in ways Curry could never.  &gt;lol more favorable spacing ? Have you seen Curry's team this year ? Oubre, Wiggins, Draymond, and Wiseman are the starters he plays with and he's STILL putting up 30 on almost 50/40/90 shooting. Stop the cap, PLEASE  Yes, more favorable spacing. Again, it is crystal clear you weren't even around to see the style of play of 2000s basketball. No one who's been around to see basketball from the 90s and 2000s would argue that spacing today is far more favorable to shooters than it was back then, regardless of who you played with. I don't know what ""cap"" means... We're clearly significantly different in age."

Threes from that range used to be bailouts only. Now, they are by design, even in clutch situations.*  [https://twitter.com/antonin\_org/status/1357412450023464962?s=20](https://twitter.com/antonin_org/status/1357412450023464962?s=20)  not this season: Stephen Curry : 11-24 FG (45.8%)   Trae Young : 9-25 (36.0%)   Damian Lillard : 14-45 (31.1%)      Curry's shooting as good from 30-40 than Kobe shot for his career.

"I mean, that's debatable. The turnaround fadeaway is so uncommon because it's one of the most difficult shots to master and shoot at an acceptable efficiency. Couple that with top tier footwork and the ability to drive to either side with the same effectiveness, and even the ability to make shots with the wrong hand or off the wrong foot... That's the type of overall skills that get you into the most skilled discussion. You say it's ""so common"" but only a handful of players today have that skill set to on a game to game basis have that as their go to shot.  &gt;Clearly the 30 footer, it’s worth more points. If a 30 footer was easier than a post fadeaway, Kobe would’ve just shot 30 footers. To put it another way: sooo many players have a midrange fadeaway in their repertoire: Kawhi, Bron, Wiggins, Irving, Paul George, Tatum, Brown, etc  It is disingenuous to say this because the 3 point shot just wasn't a strong focal point for the bulk of Kobe's career. It's for that same reason bigs would never develop a 3 point shot... They're a product of their era.   &gt;Almost no one has the 30 footer in their bag: Steph, Lillard, Trae... none of which shoot it at near the proficiency that Steph does.   That's factually incorrect.  https://www.skysports.com/nba/news/36244/12053087/damian-lillard-is-unguardable-and-his-ultra-long-range-shooting-is-changing-the-game  *Shooting from 35 feet has been normalised by him almost single-handedly - he has shot 42.4 per cent on 125 such attempts from between 30-39 feet this season, and both the volume and efficiency from that range are historic.

Now, they are by design, even in clutch situations.*  &gt;Another way to put it: Steph shoots 43% from 3 (again, the hardest shot in basketball, that’s why it’s worth the most points). Kobe shot 45% from the FIELD. Curry makes the hardest shot at near the proficiency that Kobe shot it.  You're better off using TS. Yes, Steph is more efficient because he's just that good of a shooter. But he's also playing a league with more favorable spacing for wing players and the league itself is significantly more efficient because of the style of play and rule changes that favor offense. Kobe's era was iso heavy and also shooters had less space to work with."
"In no order:  LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Jokic, Doncic, Embiid, Giannis, KD, Harden, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, KAT.   That's 17 players any sane person would take over him just on the basis of being strictly better at basketball. Then when you factor in his questionable mental state I could add on another 15-20 easily. I would say he's around top 30 at best, top 40 at worst."
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I’d put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That’s 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There’s 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."

Kawhi insane defense a great scorer, Westbrook dunking and passing and rebounds, klay catch/shoot 3 easily averaging 23-25ppg. Chris paul insane passing and great scorer and defender, larry legend survived in a more physical era one of the greatest shooters in nba history, impossible shot maker, rebounding, passing insane, Magic survived a tougher era, un human passing, good scorer, rebounding, anybody else? Oh Kareem unblockable skyhook, all time great defender, leading scorer, won mvp while not even making the playoffs more to say? Damian lillard logo 3, passing free throws, young star trae young logo threes and passing. More Dwyne wade fadeaway, AI for god sake 38-40ppg a game in 1990s crossover, jumpshot handles, IQ, passing, Ray allen leading in 3s."
"I understand that but Webber is more cringe than anything. It’s more about the content of what he says than the flow in which he commentates.    One time Damian lillard hit a gw shot and Webber yells “Dame where’s ‘0’ because no one believes in him!” which is 100% false. it’s actually the letter “O” for Ogden, Oakland and Oregon.    It’s just stupid shit like that where I can’t stand him. It feels like he just says shit just to say shit and idk how much that has to do with the play by play guy."
Yes. Do you get it though? Do NOT mention them together in the same sentence unless the sentence is “Stephen Curry is better than Damian Lillard” or “Damian Lillard is worse than Steph Curry”  You don’t want to anger them

Damian Lillard 61 vs Dallas. He carried so hard that game for a 3 point win
I think it was Kyle Lowry or Damian lillard.
"Bottom of the barrel trash. CJ and Nurkic are obviously key pieces too, but without Damian Lillard, the Trailblazers are garbage."

If you wanna look at just the last 4 seasons, Steph's 2021 is 11th in 3PM through only 49 games played, outranking the likes of Klay Thompson's best season in that span (78 GP), JJ Redick's best (76 GP), Dame's 2018 all-NBA first team season (73 GP), Dame's 2019 all-NBA season (80 GP), etc .

"oh it was very, very real in Portland.  [Here's a Woj piece from when Aldridge left the Blazers in free-agency for San Antonio that, as usual, has all the dirt](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/five-days-in-july--inside-the-free-agent-courtship-of-lamarcus-aldridge-225556837.html).  Some excerpts:   &gt; Throughout the final, formal meeting in late June, it became clear that Aldridge hadn’t completely let go of years-old issues with the way he believed ex-Blazers Brandon Roy and Greg Oden had overshadowed him in the early part of his career. This was part of Aldridge’s personality that everyone surrounding him understood – that the teams recruiting him had researched and debated internally on how to navigate in the recruiting process.  &gt; Leaving that meeting in Dallas in late June, perhaps little was more telling than the fact Aldridge never raised one particular name: Damian Lillard. Ultimately, this was the enigma of LaMarcus Aldridge. He wanted talent around him, but never too much that it might cast a shadow on his own marquee. Pleasing Aldridge was never easy, and nobody knew that better than the Portland Trail Blazers.   &gt; Aldridge loathed driving around Portland and seeing those Lillard billboards that adidas had mounted for him – even when the Blazers made Aldridge the centerpiece of every franchise marketing investment.    All of this tracks as a Spurs fan, right?  Aldridge never wanted to play the 5 even though he should, always demanded to start, and demanded a trade in 2018 because he was unhappy, right?"
"not quite end of thread. Just before bailing Portland, he had said something along the lines of ""I want to retire as the greatest trail blazer of all time"".

Dame admits it. So should everyone else.   https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-says-steph-curry-greatest-shooter-ever-play-nba  &gt;Damian Lillard says Steph Curry is the greatest shooter to ever play
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players.

"&gt;Playstyle wise, Damian Lillard and Trae Young are the most similar players to Stephen Curry  They're similar player in that they're small, (kind of) skinny and happy to pull up from anywhere, but their playstyle as in how often they run what sort of actions on court is very different. Curry famously engages in a lot of off-ball movement where fewer fouls are generally called and even then are less likely to not lead to FTs (pre-bonus), and less PnR/iso where it's the ball-handler that's getting fouled. But when he runs PnR/iso plays, he gets fouled at similar rates to the other guys mentioned.  *This isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*  (Data from this season, just as a sanity check, not as a be all end all. Using the 4 players mentioned above and a few other notable high usage ball-handlers/non-bigs.)  [PnR Ball Handler](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|7.5|11.0| |Dame|12.8|11.9| |Trae|14.3|11.9| |Harden (BKN)|8.4|11.6| |Luka|13.5|10.8| |LeBron|5.3|12.8| |Booker|6.2|10.9|  &amp;#x200B;  [Isolation](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|1.6|15.1| |Dame|4.8|13.4| |Trae|2.1|15.5| |Harden (BKN)|8.3|14.9| |Luka|4.9|7.7| |LeBron|4.6|7.9| |Giannis|4.5|15.1| |Booker|3.1|13.7|  Curry doesn't exactly stand-out in terms of how often he gets a foul call. He does stand out in terms of how often he runs an action he's likely to get a shooting foul on.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry does however lead in how many handoff plays he runs -- [let's look at the top-10 guys in terms of handoff possessions](https://go.nba.com/mc0m) and Booker since he's close and appears in tables above:  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Murray|3.2|7.2| |Curry|2.9|9.8| |Duncan Robinson|2.8|3.3| |Beal|2.8|9.9| |McDermott|2.4|5.9| |Jaylen Brown|2.3|8.8| |Jerami Grant|2.1|10.9| |Hayward|2.0|9.3| |LaVine|1.9|7.1| |Dame|1.9|8.1| |Booker|1.6|6.7|  Two things to note -- Curry is not low on the list of Shooting Foul frequency. Also, the overall shooting-foul-frequency is lower than on PnR/Iso plays -- defenders know not to foul the 3pt shooter.  This is just a quick, sanity-check look at why Curry probably has a lower baseline of foul calls and FTA than some other players -- running plays with a lower likelihood of a shooting foul more often, not simply getting calls less often on the same kind of plays.  *Again, this isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*"
"Just to play devil's advocate... I can see how people could dislike Dame. He's always insisting on how he doesn't care about what people say about him, but he absolutely does. Not saying he's thin-skinned but he always uses any perceived slander as motivation. This is absolutely fine but some people dislike that about him.  He's also way too fond of whining to the refs and he exaggerates contacts for calls no matter how much he says he doesn't flop.  I say all this as a huge Damian Lillard fan, mind you. I just think it's fair to acknowledge his flaws even though I think there's way more great things about him that bad."
"Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Damian Lillard? I think he might be washed now.... He clearly can't floor raise. He's been getting carried all this time. I think he's no longer a great shooter, Seth Curry might be better."
"In 2 games without Damian Lillard, the Blazers are 2-0 in those games. One of them is againsts 76ers which has healthy Joel Embiid on the court."
"I think the key is Damian Lillard. Without him, the Trailblazers wouldn't be so good."
"Really? Im not good at finding specific stats for advanced stuff like this, but I swore that Dame was so dominant in the clutch statistically &amp; via the eye test that it's not even close.  [https://ca.nba.com/news/stat-just-happened-damian-lillard-has-taken-dame-time-to-another-stratosphere/qsbaren5il201qs1dqk70ieqg](https://ca.nba.com/news/stat-just-happened-damian-lillard-has-taken-dame-time-to-another-stratosphere/qsbaren5il201qs1dqk70ieqg)  I think he's leading the league in clutch scoring along with guys like Zach Lavine with an 80 TS percentage... which is insane. Correct me if Im wrong tho"
"Counterpoints: Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Damian Lillard"
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
"Blazers, because Damian Lillard."
"Damian leads the subreddit in comments on how he “isn’t criticized fairly enough because he has cool playoffs moments and seems like a cool loyal guy to a small market team”  You’ve surely seen how often people say Lillard is coddled and not criticized enough. Like anything there’s a small yarn of truth to it, but on here this is frequently referenced that he isn’t criticized enough and then people go into his playoff performances comparing his numbers to CJ’s (even though Lillard is the primary focus of defensive game plans and help) and how Dame’s defense doesn’t get enough criticism."
"I do think to a degree the big market vs small market discussion is overblown these days in some respects, especially with the way both casual and non casual fans can easily seek out watching whoever they want to watch on the internet.... If a Celtics fan wanted to watch Damian Lillard highlights for example it's easier than ever to do that. The Knicks while doing better this year have been more or less irrelevant since the 90s when the Patrick Ewing era was winding down and that's a massive media market. Especially in LeBron's case he's the kind of player that he could've been playing in Sacramento or Minnesota for example and everyone would still watch him/he'd still get all sorts of offers at endorsement deals. So yeah there's a bit of truth to what you're saying, certain stars will get paid both by the team and with endorsements regardless of where they play."
Damian Lillard gets a pass for his defense when players like Harden get crapped on

I remember something like that related to the KD situation. I think KD said something along the lines of perk telling him “you know how the tv stuff goes” privately KD confronted him.  Damian Lillard also talks about [confronting skip and him backing down](https://youtu.be/dHdqzJWoi9s)

"On offense he’s great. I wish he’d work in the low post more instead of settling for fade-away all game and shooting Damian Lillard 3’s, but all his issues are on the defensive end"
"**TEAM DRJISFTW**  Fans are excited when the Dr. Jisftw used his vast medical fortune to buy an expansion team. Moreover, Damian Lillard fans are excited that the roster appears well-suited to his particular game, particularly in regards to 3+D wings in Royce O'Neal and Mikal Bridges. Due to the owner's flair, the team is slated to join the Eastern Conference.  Armed with Ben Simmons (well known defender) and those two (underrated defenders), the lineup immediately clicks together and becomes a top 10 defensive unit. Lillard thrives as a result, averaging 25-8 and emerging as a potential MVP candidate due to the stats and the team record, as the group vaults up to the # 4 seed in their first year of existence.  That said, the Eastern Conference is no joke this year, leading to a very difficult matchup with # 1 seeded Brooklyn in round two. As expected, Damian Lillard is a monster in the series, averaging 33 points per game. The team trades punches and trades wins with Brooklyn all series long, going down to the wire tied 3-3 headed into Game 7.  Unfortunately, the game is marred by some shaky officiating, as the refs call quite a few fouls on Dr. J's wings for their physical defense. James Harden ends the game going 12-14 from the FT line, which may be the difference in their 109-105 win. The team goes home salty and disappointed, but confident that they can contend with the best of the best down the road."
I’m from Walnut Creek and I claim Damian Lillard
"PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Royce O'Neale  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: Ben Simmons  C: Nicola Vucevic   Is this a championship contender? It's an odd ""Big-3"" of Dame/Ben/Vooch, but Vooch provides spacing for Ben to work in the interior. Dame and Vooch aren't the best defenders but you're surrounding them with two 3&amp;D guys and one of the best defenders in the league right now."
"Bay Area, Damian Lillard"
"&gt;Remember four comments ago when you were arguing stats from 35-40 feet shouldn't be used to evaluate a shot from 37 feet because it's the wrong ""grouping"" and that it was the equivalent of comparing 12+ feet stats to 3s. Good times.  No, I said stats using all shots from 30+ ft shouldn't be used for shots from 37 ft, because a 31ft shot is significantly different from a 37ft shot.   So stop lying please.  The first three pointer Lillard hit in the game was from 30ft. I think you mean the one from the start of the third quarter which was a 34ft shot.  I don't care who uses a lot of 31-32 ft shots to justify a 37ft shot, it's lazy and bad statistics. If you don't think even 3 ft matter (much less 7 ft if you think that using any shot over 30ft is useful) then you should tell all those nba teams that guarding the corner isn't important because there's no real difference between a corner three and an above the break 3.  I was using a hyperbolic example of how uncontested warm up shots are different from contested in game shots.  Also Damian Lillard needs more than 1 season shooting above 40% from 3 to be called a top 5 shooter in nba history.  Paul George just wanted to stop being memed by fans who think every shot that goes in is a good one and every shot that misses is a bad one. He's also speaking with two years of hindsight that wasn't available at the time. At the time Lillard was 1 for 8 from that range.  I'm comfortable being in a minority on the point, people mocked PG when he said Dallas wasn't playing great defence on him in that series. If you go break down the stats you'll find he was getting a lot of open looks and missing them, but people don't care.  So yeah, if I'm on defence and a player wants to take a shot from a range he's never hit in a game before, I'm comfortable thinking it's a bad shot and giving it to him, because based on the information at the time that's true.  But we're not going to convince each other so might as well leave it there. Goodbye."
You thought the Lakers were signing Damian Lillard to a ten day?
"Remember four comments ago when you were arguing stats from 35-40 feet shouldn't be used to evaluate a shot from 37 feet because it's the wrong ""grouping"" and that it was the equivalent of comparing 12+ feet stats to 3s. Good times.      Now you are comparing Dwight Howard, a notoriously bad shooter, and his proclivity to not be able to translate practice to the game, to a top 5 shooter in NBA history and arguably the most clutch player in NBA history. Hardly the same.      ""I didn't want to put it into the referee hands,"" Lillard said. ""Where if there was contact or maybe they get away with contact or I end up having to take a **tougher shot** because there was contact and they don't want to decide the game. So I was standing there looking at the rim and I was like this is a comfortable range.""   ...  For most anyone else, it probably is. For Lillard, it has become maybe his most lethal. Per Second Spectrum, Lillard is 8-of-12 from 30-plus feet this postseason, compared to 6-of-38 for everyone else. ""  Source: [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26592185/lillard-37-foot-buzzer-shot-last-word](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26592185/lillard-37-foot-buzzer-shot-last-word)  "" Yet if Lillard can play anywhere close to this level going forward, it requires at least a brief reevaluation of everything. He had 34 points in the first half alone on Tuesday and hit three of his four attempts from 30-plus feet, including the one that sent the Thunder packing.  Lillard’s ability to sink those shots — paired with Oklahoma City’s surprise that he’d even have the audacity to try them in some cases — was one of the key reasons Portland ran away with the series 4-1. The Thunder allowed him too much cushion, largely because defenders haven’t adjusted to the realization that Lillard, with nearly limitless range on his off-dribble jumpers, has arguably become the closest thing we have to [Golden State’s Stephen Curry](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/basketballs-other-3-point-revolution/).     ...   And unfortunately for the Thunder, that one — **which might have been a bad shot for just about anybody other than Lillard** — was enough to end their season in the most brutal way possible.

And like you said, it’s not like it’s a half-court heave. **These are shots that are well in their range. They probably could shoot them deeper**,” George said per [Tomer Azarly](https://twitter.com/TomerAzarly/status/1368782815001604096).

For comparison, if I remember correctly, Damian Lillard, steph's son, is shooting 44/38/93 from the field this year. Yes you read it right, 44 FG% and 38 3pt%. Sorry for the long post, skip bayless just gets on my nerves at times."
&gt; some reason  aka Damian Lillard
"There was a story about it in The Athletic a couple days ago.  &gt; In May of 2020, he checked in on the Portland-area home of his cousin and personal chef, Brandon Johnson, and found him dead on the kitchen floor. Brandon, or Chef B as he was called, was 35. &gt;  &gt; “I stood over his body, man. Like, he was dead. Minutes. I’m standing over his body,” Lillard said. “People don’t know what type of trauma that is, and what that is to have somebody that close to you laid out and you stand over him. Like, I still struggle with that. You know what I mean? Like, I still struggle with that. That’s a battle for me.” &gt;  &gt; That morning, Lillard called teammate CJ McCollum, who was also close to Johnson, and when McCollum arrived, the two cried together in the kitchen.

"How do you ""ban"" super teams? How do you make a bracket when there are only 30 teams? Your suggestions make no sense.  No, here's what you do:  1. Don't count super-max extensions against the cap. Make it easier for teams to offer the super-max. Players like Damian Lillard could then earn amounts competitive to bigger markets without leaving smaller teams. I know Lillard hasn't left, but it would make teams like the Trail Blazers more competitive in the FA market.  2. Move the 1st round of the playoffs back to a best-of-5. Upsets would occasionally happen in a best of 5 format. It no longer does. This change that occurred around 2000 in no way made the game more exciting.  3. This one is more opinion, but allow defense again. Allow hand checking. Touch fouls 30 feet from the basket aren't good television viewing and do not exist in leagues besides the NBA. It's just bad.  4. Change the way the game ends. There is too much fouling to end games. The two ways you fix this are, either you end the game on a TIMER, or you go to a 1-and-1 free throw shooting like in college. The timer method is you basically play ""first to 10 points beyond 48 minutes."" So if at 48 minutes the game is 120-110, the first team to 130 points wins. The benefit here is there is ALWAYS a game winning shot. Way more exciting. The alternative is the 1-and-1 free throw system, which places way more importance on making end of game free throws. This system allows teams to come from behind in the final minutes in a way that the current system prevents."
"I see a lot of people in the comments saying that PG was right in that it was a bad shot. At that point in his career Dame was 30.3% (37-122) on shots between 30-40 ft. That season he was 39.2% (20-51) from that distance, and that playoffs he was 66.7% (8-12) from that range. Using the first number it was a decent shot, the second number it was a good shot, and the last number it was a fantastic shot. It was not in any way--mathematically speaking--a bad shot for Dame Lillard to take based on his prior shooting percentages. [Sources](https://hoopshype.com/2019/04/24/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-37-feet-deep-three-pointers/) would be Hoopshype, and Kirk Goldsberry among others who covered it at the time."

Draymond has always refused a DNA test so Damian can't claim child support.  But this is why Damian has a tattoo of a wild donkey on his right arm. It is a symbol of his never fulfilled relationship with his father
"LeBron ""Damian Lillard"" James with the game winning mid court 3!"

"Damian lillard hits that too, he gets no respect"
"Only he and Damian Lillard, you mean."
Damian Lillard: And I took that personally.
Have you ever heard of Steph Curry? Or Nikola Jokic? Or maybe you’ve heard of Damian Lillard?
"23 fga without Dame, missing Damian Lillard does that to a guy who’s not a #1 option scorer (Sexton isn’t good enough to be a #1 right now either btw). Your arguments based on fga and there’s more to basketball than that. I’m sure Sexton will keep improving and will probably surpass CJ in the future, but right now CJ’s the better player."
"It's not arbitrary **if they were literally injured**. [Here's an article talking about him getting injured at the end of the 4th on 3/19](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-plays-through-knee-pain-says-hes-just-dealing-stiffness-and)...you know, right before having all his stats majorly drop off  It would be arbitrary if he didn't have a known injury dude. He even sat out some games trying to get healthy."
I disagree. I know I’m being a homer as a blazers fan but there are zero situations where I’m taking late 30’s chris Paul over prime Damian Lillard.
"Damian Lillard, pretty clearly. No doubt CP3 deserves a big share of the credit for Phoenix but somehow he’s getting 90% of it."
"He's a terrible shooter yet jacks up a ton of shots. In the modern NBA, that's extremely exploitable. He doesn't play defense or move well off the ball. He's extremely predictable, which makes him easier to scheme for. Wb isn't a dude who can beat you in a million different ways. The things he's really good at aren't necessarily the things that win NBA championships. His efficiency is bad, yet he shoots a lot. The simple fact is that he's overrated. Sorry wb fans but he's not incredible. He's a very good player with some glaring holes that plays like he's an MVP. People's expectations of him are too high. Defense and shot making win championships. High BBIQ wins championships. Patience and emotional control win championships. Wb doesn't do any of those things. This happens literally every year, where people are blinded by the fact he's putting up triple doubles and forget that he can't shoot and doesn't play hard when he doesn't have the ball. Then every year the playoffs come, and he doesn't only disappoint, he's bad. The thing that really kills him is that he doesn't know how to step back and play in a way that covers up his weaknesses. Forget the time that he literally laughed at the idea that it was hard to guard Steph and then got absolutely roasted, what about the time he did the same to Ricky Rubio? Or Damian Lillard? Wb would be a really, really useful guy if he shot the ball less and tried harder on defense, and not just at the end of games. But he won't do those things, and then you've got a walking brick who's shooting like he's a walking bucket instead. But everyone gives him a pass because he's sassy and confident and plays through injuries, and that's admirable. But he's simply not a winner. Now, we can debate what that means for his legacy, but the truth of the matter is he's just overrated. He's a regular season star who plays in a way that just gets exposed when it actually matters. Every year, we go through the same damn cycle. I was getting blasted with downvotes yesterday because I had the temerity to suggest that he wasn't one of the greatest scorers and playmakers of all time. I'll say it again, if you're below average efficiency-wise and take a lot of shots, you're gonna lose against above average teams. Maybe not every night, but enough to kill you when it counts. He's just not that good.  The best metaphor I ever saw for Russ was this: watching him is like watching a guy eat ten cheeseburgers. Is it healthy? No. But God, do I want to watch a guy eat ten cheeseburgers."
People really get on this website to say Russell Westbrook is a better basketball player than Damian Lillard💀
Damian Lillard disappeared?
"He's a top rebounder for a PG but Westbrook getting 15 rebounds is less valuable than someone like Klay Thompson or Damian Lillard grabbing 15 rebounds.  Just watch the game, are you really that impressed by Westbrook being right under the rim with every Celtics player already back in transition after a shot attempt goes up, and he grabs the board with all the other players cleared out?  Clearly his team schemes for him to grab a ton of rebounds to initiate offense faster, not necessarily stat padding, but it's not THAT impressive.  Edit: He just got a sick putback, like I said he's an outstanding rebounder for a PG, but his RPG is definitely inflated... he averages more boards per minute than Tristian Thompson who is clearly a better rebounder."
Blazers(Damian Lillard) This team has the highest potential in the league. The reason for that is Dame. Dame can go from a 9 point game to a 50 point game in two games. The defense is honestly underrated at sometimes. It can be a top 15 defense if stotts is willing to coach. So what i'm pretty much saying is this team will go as far as dame goes and if what dame is saying is true then this team might be a wcf or finals contender.

I love Damian Lillard so much. Even with this year feeling like our year if Portland beats us I don't even think I would be that mad.
"Damian Lillard for me.  Giannis is unstoppable at scoring in the paint, but Lillard has infinite range and draws double teams wherever he's standing in the halfcourt."

Damian Lillard saved a man from becoming homeless tonight.
Damian fking Lillard
"Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr., man of the people."
You might be a little too short when Damian Lillard is backing you down.
"https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-plays-through-knee-pain-says-hes-just-dealing-stiffness-and  ""No evidence.""  Now go look where Dame's ""slump"" started. Maybe 3/21? Right after that knee injury?    Curry sat out when he got hurt. Don't you remember? Dame played through."
"That’s not true though. Dame is probably the closest player on earth to Steph. Maybe Kyrie because of his efficiency.  Imagine being Dame, growing up in Oakland and watching Steph roll in there, win 3 rings and now he forever will be reminded that he’s “not Steph Curry”. If Steph didn’t exist, we’d be saying “Trae young is a great value of Damian Lillard”."
"Let me set the stage here folks:   On April 18, a guy who goes by the name *LordTreeSap* on Twitter, sent out a tweet to Damian Lillard that he needed the Blazers to win 42 games in order for him to keep his house.   This guy presumably bet the over on Portland’s win total before the season, which was set at 41.5 wins per Westgate Las Vegas and most sportsbooks around the country  So on April 18, the Blazers had a 32-23 record. 55 games played, and 17 to go...all this guy needed was for Portland to finish 10-7 or better and he wouldn’t lose his house. (I’m guessing he bet the mortgage on his house, which was a horrible decision, but hey, some of us are extreme degenerates when it comes to gambling)  Fast forward to April 26 and Portland had lost 5 straight, they were 32-28 and things were NOT looking good for our guy.   But then a miraculous thing happened. Portland won 4 in a row and 9 out of their last 11.   This man needed them to go 10-2 over their final 12 games to get to 42 wins and they’ve gone 9-2 with 1 game left!   He’s still got a chance!   Now I don’t know about you but I’m not sure how I would be surviving knowing that Portland needed to win 10 out of their last 12 games for me to avoid losing my house and living in my car but holy crap what a roller coaster this must be.   I’m praying for this man, and I hope Dame delivers"
Damian Lillard is my favorite rapper turned NBA Star.
"Not after 50 games. The 50 games he was healthy - the first 40, and then the last 11 to be precise.   Dame was averaging 31/8 on 63% TS% in the 40 games prior to [getting hurt on 3/19 against the Mavs.](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillard-plays-through-knee-pain-says-hes-just-dealing-stiffness-and) He then played 15 games while injured (3/23-4/25) and averaged 23/7 on 53% TS%  He didn't get healthy until the Indiana game (first time he tried to dunk and looked remotely himself), and again went right back to averaging 31/8 a game, but on 72.2% TS%  Aka 40 games of 31/8 on 63% TS%, an injured 15 games of 23/7 on 53% TS%, then back to healthy 11 games of 31/8 on 72% TS%"
What does everyone here think of Damian Lillard as a rapper?
"PG had 5 points on 16 shots (2/16 from the floor). Melo had 7 points on 7 shots  Russ shot better from the field (42%) and from 3 (37%) than Damian Lillard has shot in the playoffs his entire career (40%, 36%)  also Russ did not “literaly have as many shots as points” it was 46 points on 43 shots, along with 10 rebounds and 5 assists. Russ had a 50% TS, PG had a 14.8 TS%, Melo had a 44% TS.   Kawhi had 41 on 39 shots in the game 7 vs philly (48% TS) because nobody else could hit shots that game. him needing a lot of FGA doesn’t make it less of a legendary performance.   it’s a playoff elimination game dude efficiency is always going to be lower. you can’t just salivate over efficiency numbers as a way to nullify all their other contributions."
Damian Lillard punching the air rn
"Damian lillard isnt a top 5 guard, maybe top 25 at best /s"
"I don't need to watch him to know he has neither the tools, desire, or reputation.   For what its worth I went looking on a few metrics for him and my finger got tired from scrolling.  Hes 234th out of 250 in defensive raptor, for example. In the same area as Demar Derozan, Carmelo Anthony, DeAngelo Russell, Damian Lillard and Trae Young. Tell me defensive Raptor isn't on to something."
I believe you’re thinking of Matthew “Damian” Lillard
so he's Damian Lillard?
This dude really thought he needed to sell a blazers fan on Damian Lillard.

About as good as Damian Lillard
Damian lillard probably. Unless you're in okc
"Considering Damian Lillard is my favorite non-bull in the league right now, it’s definitely possible."
You might be right and you might be wrong. There's really no historical support for so the entire thing is speculation and pretty pointless to argue about.   It would be like trying to determine if Damian Lillard + Bradley Beal should be a more successful combo than Damian Lillard + Jayson Tatum.
"***All-NBA 1st Team***      C: Nikola Jokic      F: Joel Embiid      F: Giannis Antetokounmpo      G: Luka Doncic      G: Steph Curry      ***All-NBA 2nd Team***      C: Rudy Gobert      F: Julius Randle      F: Zion Williamson      G: Damian Lillard      G: Chris Paul      ***All-NBA 3rd Team***      C: Bam Adebayo      F: Kawhi Leonard      F: LeBron James      G: Jimmy Butler      G: Paul George"
I would assume non-Damian Lillard minutes overlap with those non-Jokic minutes though?
I feel like this is a true statement for every player not named steph curry or Damian lillard.
"I disagree. The guy instills zero playmaking into the team. Every possession is Iso or pnr, and there is no defensive identity.  You can absolutely make it to the playoffs 8 years in a row when you have a player name Damian Lillard. All Stotts does is let the guys do whatever they want, and when you have exceptional guards that leads to winning.  They may have made it to the playoffs 8 years straight, but have never won more than 1 game in the rounds they are eliminated. They have been swept 3 times and and have lost in 5 games every other year. That is ABSOLUTELY a sign of a bad coach, zero ability to adapt and evolve players.  When it comes to management of any kind, certain people are good at certain things and almost no one is good at everything. Terry is a decent coach for a team  like the Blazers were 8 years ago. He is good at getting young players to be confident and find their game, he is atrocious at being competitive at a high level."

He's always been sassy as fuck. I love his attitude. He's light hearted but chooses the perfect words when he's being serious or trying to get into it with someone. Hope he's a blazer forever more than anyone not named Damian Lillard.

Damian Lillard should be castrated for passing the ball when his shot wasn’t falling. What a fucking moron
Shit I guess damian lillard can't complain either because hes a multi millionaire even though hes had multiple family members and close friends die to covid. Theirs always going to be people with a worse life than you.

Stop it get some help. Damian Lillard is not by far the best player in 2021.
Curry is just crazy man. The fact that the all-time record came in a season where curry sat like every other 4th quarter is seriously amazing. This season coming in 4th all-time in a shortened year is a great feat as well. Sidenote I expected more Damian Lillard here

"That's a ton of time lol  I just watched that team hit 4, very tough 3s in a row. 3.2 seconds to rebound, run down and shoot a 3 is plenty of time for Damian Lillard."
"This game really was the ultimate 2021 Portland Trailblazers experience.     \- Damian Lillard splitting the defense to hit wide open wings who proceed to throw up bricks     \- Jusuf Nurkic, knowing his team's only chance of staying in the game is with him on the floor, removing himself from the game by committing a pointless boneheaded foul with five minutes left      \- Terry Stotts deciding the best way to handle Jokic over the final five minutes is by bodying him up with Carmelo Anthony and Robert Covington (!)     \- CJ repeatedly sagging off of Austin Rivers as he drills open three after open three"
"Either Clyde Drexler or Damian Lillard, depending on who is #1.  Bill Walton would have been had he stayed healthy.  Three Hall of Famers. Not bad."
"You have guys who were drafted after 2012 and never won shit over NBA champions, Finals MVPs, and Olympic gold medalists whose careers are done.  Lots of guys don't score as many points as Damian Lillard but I still consider them better, winning players."

"I also think Ben Wallace and/or Billups should be on that list. Howard ABSOLUTELY should be there.  Especially with Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Damian Lillard making it ahead of him. Not that they're not deserving but they're definitely less deserving than Howard"
"And they both made it. Nowhere did I say Damian Lillard shouldn’t have made it, maybe you should read better. I’m just telling you that your criticism of Reggie Miller is unfounded- you literally said “all he could do was be a great individual scorer for a long time!”  You Blazer fans are insane lol. I didn’t even mention Dame and you had to defend him lmao."
"I mean the 1 name I've seen thrown around a bunch who Dwight is obviously ahead of is Damian Lillard.  Don't get me wrong - love me some Dame, but their resumes aren't even comparable."
"For me, it’s like this:  **OUT**  Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard  **IN**  Dwight Howard   Grant Hill  I accept Carmelo Anthony’s inclusion on this list, he is one of the great scorers of his generation, but if he has to be replaced, I would replace him with Tracy McGrady.   And honourable mention to Vern Mikkelsen."
"Stackhouse was a 2 time all-star and made zero All-NBA teams (he did make all rookie in 1996).  He scored about as many points in his career as Damian Lillard has already.  Sorry but no, he was not even close to a snub"
"Dwight Howard: 8x NBA All Star, 8x All NBA, 1x NBA Champion, 3x DPOY  Tony Parker: 6x NBA All Star, 4x All NBA, 4x NBA Champion, 1x FMVP  Damian Lillard: 6x NBA All Star, 6x All NBA, 0x NBA Champion, 0x FMVP         Tell me how Dame is a top 75 player ever but Parker or Dwight are not. I'll wait."
"Delusion is alluding to the Sixers acquiring Damian lillard without Simmons.   Either way, we will see what happens. Sixers will def trade Simmons. I just agree it’s better to wait than trade him right now."
I’m sorry but I just don’t see how Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard deserve to be on this list over Dwight Howard.
&gt; despite him accomplishing jack shit as a number one option.  Other than embarrassing Damian Lillard in the playoffs
"Damian Fucking Lillard and Dennis Rodman over Dwight, TP, Bosh? Fucking kidding me. Dave Bing, Dave Debusschere, Bill Sharman and Pistol Pete stay on? What the shit."
"I wouldn’t doubt it one bit, especially considering the semi-of-the-moment picks like Damian Lillard.   I’d bet Dwight and Vince’s legacies both grow the further we get from their retirements. Not hard to imagine voters hitting up that decency bias where Vince and Dwight seem less great because they do recently played while out of their primes."

"&gt; And Morey might actually be the only GM in the league that has the balls to understand that this is a game of chicken, and as long as he doesn't swerve, he isn't losing.  You see, you are right, it is a game of chicken. But, the defining thing about a game of chicken is that if neither party swerves, they both lose! Right now, Morey is playing a game of chicken with Ben Simmons and it's absolutely possible that they both lose.  Also, it's not purely black and white. This is not the stock market. There's actually people involved. So let me ask you this. If I'm the type of player that the 6ers want in exchange for Simmons, and I just watched Morey drag an All Star player through the mud for trade value, why would I risk my career with you?  If I'm Damian Lillard, and I have a similar contract to Simmons, I play in Philly for a year and it doesn't quite work, am I going to trust you to look after me?  Nobody fined James Harden when he didn't show up. The Spurs continued to pay Leonard even after he was medically cleared by the team staff, and even after he asked for a trade. Nobody, until now has dragged a star player through the mud like this. This is the cost of ""playing hardball"" with Simmons. Just because something is in the contract doesn't mean it's in your best interest to enforce it."
Damian Lillard
The difference is you know that Zendaya is out of reach.  Morey is still living in some fantasy world where Damian Lillard somehow comes to the Sixers and Portland is okay with that.
"Damian Lillard, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Webber, Ewing.   Bench:   Westbrook, Oscar Roberston, Vince Carter, Ben Wallace, Dominique Wilkins, Gobert, Karl “Kid diddler” Malone (Since I just hate his sorry self)"
"To say nothing for the fact that [Dame](https://theathletic.com/2901000/2021/10/19/damian-lillard-says-im-not-leaving-portland-and-one-reason-why-is-chauncey-billups/) has made it sound like it's very unlikely he leaves, the only way they are in play is (1) if they demand out and (2) they also demand going to Philly. That's two big ifs, and screwing over Portland or Washington on the way out the door is a tough look. If other teams are in the mix as trade partners, Philly might be out of luck if Morey's trade demands stay crazy."
In this case one of those parties could be realistic about how much value his piece has instead of asking for a Damian lillard sized price for extremely damaged goods.   You can’t say you want to trade him then ask for the fucking moon for a player whose value is in the dump
"On Friday he said ""[I'm not leaving Portland](https://theathletic.com/2901000/2021/10/19/damian-lillard-says-im-not-leaving-portland-and-one-reason-why-is-chauncey-billups/),"" but even if he went back on his word, it would mean (1) Portland sucks enough that he wants out, which isn't a given, and (2) Philly being the only named location. There's a good chance a few teams would be in contention, especially if Dame is not trying to screw Portland on the way out the door. All of that could happen, but I wouldn't bet on it."
"I suspect Morey had some reasonable options over the summer. The issue seems to be that Morey wants to trade his disgruntled star for a player who's even better than him. He wants to turn Simmons into a Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard, which is probably what he wanted to do anyways.   A lot of front offices would have traded Simmons over the off-season. I guess we will see how Morey's approach pans out."
But I thought they could force him to play so it would be easy to trade him for Damian Lillard
Shame time. But in all seriousness I love me some Damian Lillard
"I believe the final 25 will be:      11 Locks: Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Kawhi Leonard, Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Dolph Schayes, Dwyane Wade, Dominique Wilkins  6 Probables: Carmelo Anthony, Billy Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Robert Parish, Russell Westbrook  2 Likely but on the bubble: Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman  5 Squeaking in: Ray Allen, Dave Debusschere, Grant Hill, Bob McAdoo, Tracy McGrady  10 Biggest new omissions: Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Dikembe Mutombo, Tony Parker, Ben Wallace   4 Omissions from top 50: Dave Bing, Pete Maravich, Earl Monroe, Lenny Wilkens"

He's like a lesser talented Damian Lillard who also doesn't play defense. They should've traded him 4 season ago.
Is it time to worry about Damian Lillard?
I hope sixers management should looked up maxey as their future starting pg replacing ben simmons.. That guy is legit. They dont need damian lillard.. Maxey is enough
"With no research, just off the top of my head, I'd have  Unquestionably above him: Magic, Isiah Thomas, Steph, Steve Nash, Stockton, Oscar.  Above him but the gap is smaller: Kidd, CP3, Gary Payton, Harden (debatable since he played SG for a while), Allen Iverson.  I rank them higher but I acknowledge it's open to debate: Tony Parker, Damian Lillard, Westbrook.  That's 14 names and I'm assuming I forgot some of the older greats from the 60's-80's. So I think 15-20 is a reasonable landing spot for him."
"Just cuz I’m bored at work….  I’d say Kyrie is in the top 20 discussion, id have no problem leaving him out and no problem with those that include him  In no particular order and help me as I’m sure I’m leaving some out (maybe even obvious ones)  1.	Magic 2.	The Big O 3.	Isiah Thomas 4.	Stockton 5.	Steph Curry 6.	CP3 7.	Steve Nash 8.	JKidd 9.	 Gary Payton 10. Bob Cousy 11. Walt “Clyde” Frazier  12. Nate “Tiny” Archibald 13. Allen Iverson 14.Sidney Moncrief 15. Dennis Johnson 16. Chauncey Billups 17. Tony Parker 18. Russell Westbrook 19. Penny Hardaway 20. Tim Hardaway 21. Lenny Wilkens 22. Damian Lillard 23. Dave Bing   I can see an argument for Kyrie over a number of the guys on the list and certainly not an argument for top 10. Kyrie has a chance to still build to his legacy, but the last few years he’s absolutely torpedo’d his legacy…  We shall see"
"Trade suggestion:  * **PHI gets**: Damian Lillard * **LAL gets**: CJ McCollum, Norman Powell * **POR gets**: Russell Westbrook, Talen Horton-Tucker, Tyrese Maxey, Ben Simmons, 2022 FRP (via PHI), 2024 FRP (via PHI), 2026 FRP (via PHI), 2028 FRP (via PHI), 2025 FRP (via LAL)"
If we take our FG% the only other person is Damian Lillard.   I included that to show how much of a plus he was in almost every efficiency category/stat. Not to cherry pick.  Being above 50/40/80 &amp; 60% is insanity.
So who are the new 16 then if we assume those 9 are in.  Thinking the locks are:  LeBron Steph Kobe D Wade Westbrook Kawhi Dominique  Bob McAdoo Kidd Gary Payton  Then 6 spots left for:  Carmelo Dwight Howard Vince Carter Alex English Adrian Dantley Pau Gasol Bernard King Tracy McGrady Reggie Miller Luka Doncic Damian Lillard Anthony Davis
"Deaaron Fox   Damian Lillard   Ja Morant   Draymond Green    Just off the top of my head, those are some more guys who immediately come to mind as dudes with the “dog” in them."
Russ let them down I think the old guys played well. I think LeBron needs to trade Westbrook for Damian Lillard or really any allstar level guy that can shoot.
"I think its both. Imagine you're Damian Lillard and you were already on the fence about the FO trading away your buddy McCollum for Simmons, and now Damian is seeing news that Simmons doesn't want to practice, than Embiid is implies Simmons needs a babysitter. He might just tell the front office not to do it. Both because he doesn't want to play with Simmons and also because he doesn't want to subject his buddy to a coaching staff that talks crap about their own players and suspends them."
"Damian Lillard babysitting Portland, confirmed."
"&gt; Paul George is a better player than Damian Lillard, including in the playoffs   Except for the fact that Lillard has never had the stacked teams George has consistently had in his career and splashed a series game winner in his face."
"Yeah dude, height matters. But it doesn't matter much when you're guarding Damian Lillard lmao.   It's almost like you have to use context.   Dame wouldn't be able to tell Bev he's too small, because Bev is the same damn height Dame is lol.   At the end of the day, Dame was vastly more efficient, and anything else is just making an excuse for his stats being worse. Believe it or not I don't care what his stats would be if he had made shots he missed. Because he missed them.  I could also decide to make his 3P% lower like it normally is but you'd say that's unfair. Make your damn FTs man.  They count"
1972 Lakers  PG: Damian Lillard (Gail Goodrich)  SG: Paul George (Jerry West)  SF: Tobias Harris (Jim McMillian)  PF: Jarrett Allen (Happy Hairston)  C: Rudy Gobert (1972 (not 1962) Wilt Chamberlain)
Greater than Damian Lillard
"I can perfectly understand your argument, but I’m just saying that it’s a flawed one. Scottie Pippen is 100% a better player than Damian Lillard, but the furthest he ever got as a first option was the second round."
"Damian Lillard, Paul George, Deandre Ayton"
"if only there were some other basketball event which we could look to for examples and data about what happens when dumb fouls aren't called.  perhaps a tournament populated almost exclusively by elite players.  it would be really interesting if someone like, let's say, Damian Lillard, happened to have worse production in such an event."
"i was heavy on both williams and trob too lol, can't get them all right. but i was fortunately right about these two guys named Steph Curry and Damian Lillard so..."
OP could have used Point per shot and made it more clear. Now you can see how KD is way  ahead the curve.  PPS	        NAME  1.45	Kevin Durant  1.38	LeBron James  1.36	Oscar Robertson  1.36	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  1.34	Damian Lillard  1.34	Wilt Chamberlain  1.32	Jerry West  1.32	George Gervin  1.31	Michael Jordan  1.28	Kobe Bryant  1.26	Larry Bird  1.25	Carmelo Anthony
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
"Guard Damian Lillard, will make the Portland Trail Blazers' opening night roster and then ask to be traded around mid season, source tells ESPN."
"Stephen Curry and LeBron James, as well as Kevin Durant, Giannis, and Damian Lillard."

Right now it's Damian Lillard. Not because of his skillset but Portland just isn't a a major FA attraction
How can you expect Damian Lillard to request a trade to the sixers? He has five years on his contract left.
"I was looking at [ESPN's top 74](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/29105574/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-74-41) recently.   Damian Lillard was 72 and I think that's a pretty decent benchmark. Dame being right on the edge of making the list sets the stage for a lot of current players missing out.   The other borderline guy I liked was Mutumbo. With 8 All-Stars and 4 DPOYs and still only being borderline, it sets a decent precedent for guys like Rudy Gobert, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard."
"Elite of the elite in this league is LeBron/AD/Russ, KD/Harden/Kyrie or Giannis/Khris/Jrue. The Sixers would have to be keep Ben and then add Damian Lillard to the roster to get to that level."
"Top 5 Now Steph Curry, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Trae Young.  In 5 Years that’s tough, but I say. Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Cade Cunningham."
"&gt;Vaccination Status and Star Treatment:  &gt;Yet team management and ownership figures across the league have voiced frustration about double standards for players like Irving, whom the NBA does not require to be vaccinated.   &gt;Meanwhile, the league does require basketball and business operations staffers to be vaccinated, and they are subject to close contact with unvaccinated players.  This has nothing to do with ""star treatment"" and everything to do with collective bargaining.   I'd note there's also no mandate on owners being vaccinated.  &gt;Proposals have varied, but they largely center on something that would be a reverse trade kicker of sorts, where players can receive a maximum bonus of 15 percent of their salary if a team decides to move them. Some team officials want to see a player who requests a trade forfeit upwards of 70 percent of his salary. Others have told B/R about what seems like a far more realistic scenario, where the player in question would only make 60 percent of his guaranteed money once he requests a new team.  These are pipe dreams from owners. There is no formal definition of a ""trade request,"" and there is no workable definition. Players can very easily make it be known that they want out without ever directly requesting a trade, and encouraging players to do that through the media rather than directly with the front office doesn't resolve any problems.  &gt; Paying a player up to 35 percent of the salary cap when rival suitors cannot hinders a front office's ability to surround that player with the supplementary talent needed to win a championship. And when that team drifts out of contention, that player has typically requested a trade, such as Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City and James Harden in Houston. Many rival executives hope the same eventually occurs with Damian Lillard in Portland.  The OKC and HOU front offices cheaping out by refusing to pay the tax to compete is not an actual problem the league needs to resolve. Giving superstars a smaller portion of the cap will just lead to superteams fitting more stars onto their rosters.  &gt;But executives are curious about adding a budgeted waiver system that would allow teams to bid on bought-out players similar to the popular free-agent budgets in fantasy sports  This sounds fun, but I'm not sure many players would agree to buyouts if they couldn't control their next move."

Its time for people to start talking about Jayson Tatum over Damian Lillard..
It’s 100000% personnel issues that can’t be solved with coaching. Unfortunately the big dumb idiot making the decisions thinks it was coaching so we’re wasting yet another year of Damian Lillard
"Luka is not better all time than Carmelo, he very likely will be but if he had a career ending injury he’s nowhere near melo all time. I love embiid but he’s not either, Damian lillard isn’t either. Carmelo is 10th all time in scoring and look at the context of who he was competing with for nba first teams at the forward position"
"I'd put a 25 year old 6'10"" freak athlete in the same value tier as 32 year old Harden/Damian Lillard. I don't think its that big of a deal. Being in the east i'd rather have Simmons. Easily one of the best player's to slow down Giannis."
"Yes. I'm sure some athletes are coddled during their youth, but not all are. Why don't you look into a guy named Damian Lillard. Which is why I'm asking if there's evidence to this or it's just a misinformed generalization."
"They have Carmelo Anthony below Damian lillard, joel embiid, McGrady, and luka doncic. That doesn’t make sense"
"1.Steph Curry  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 1st &lt;=&gt; 3rd  2.Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 1st &lt;=&gt; 5th  3.Nikola Jokic  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 1st &lt;=&gt; 5th  4.Kevin Durant  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 1st &lt;=&gt; 6th  5.Kawhi Leonard  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 2nd &lt;=&gt; 6th  6.Lebron James  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 2nd &lt;=&gt; 9th  7.James Harden  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 6th &lt;=&gt; 9th  8.Joel Embiid  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 7th &lt;=&gt; 9thh  9.Luka Doncic  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 5th &lt;=&gt; 10th  10.Damian Lillard  * Range (Optimistic &lt;=&gt; Pessimistic): 10th &lt;=&gt; 10th   Factoring health in:  1.

"There isn’t 2 tiers and that’s just ridiculous to say that. Maybe an S tier? With a close tier 1 to follow, then clearly there’s role players after that.  If you genuinely think a bench player is better than Damian Lillard I don’t know what to tell you other than your evaluations are horrible."
"&gt; Portland   “If you’re so interested, why don’t you trade us Damian Lillard and multiple picks?” - Morey"
"&gt;The Sixers [] are only open to trading him for one of the few players in a tier above Simmons, such as Damian Lillard, or James Harden before him.  This may be one of the stupidest things I have ever read.  Morey: We only want to trade you for someone BETTER than you.  Uh....how does that trade work, exactly? What is the incentive for the other team?"
"&gt; The Sixers have stood firm that they don't necessarily want to move Simmons and are only open to trading him for one of the few players in a tier above Simmons, such as Damian Lillard, or James Harden before him. The Sixers still believe the dominant defensive pairing between him and Embiid can be the backbone of a 2022 title team.  This is definitely the message that Morey wants to send to the rest of the league because it gives him the most leverage in trade talks.  Whether reporters should be acting as credulous messengers is another question."
"&gt;and are only open to trading him for one of the few players in a tier above Simmons, such as Damian Lillard, or James Harden before him.  Someone should tell Morey his tiers are wildly simplified."
"So which of the big three is going to run into Damian Lillard and have a career ending injury? If we're sticking with historical precedent, it should be Westbrook, but I'm pretty sure Anthony Davis once tore two ligaments sneezing so I'm tempted to guess it'd be him."
"&gt;yeah but a few have softer touch(without naming any) and GIANNIS is more mobile  Damian Lillard doesn't have better shooting than Steph, why would anyone pay him the max? /s"
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Blazers have only signed 13 players to the roster. The 14th spot is still open, and the 15th spot will remain open. Blevins is on a 2 way contract, is not the 13th man on the roster, and will not be the 14th.   ""Two-way players are “extra” signings in addition to the normal 15-man roster for each franchise."" [Here's this link to the Blevins signing.](https://www.blazersedge.com/2021/9/23/22690741/trail-blazers-sign-keljin-blevins-two-way-contract-2021-22-damian-lillard-cousin)"
"MVP: Damian Lillard  MIP: Wendell Carter DPOY: Anthony Davis 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Davion Mitchell  Not outright predictions, but if the stars align I think these players could walk away with some awards.  Dame is the backbone of Portland, and if they end up in a 1 or 2 seed come playoff time, I could see Dame walking away as MVP.  I was high on Wendell when he was drafted, but he has never really lived up to my expectations. I could see him taking a big jump offensively coming into his first full year in Orlando, if he gets his 11PPG up closer to the 20 mark, he will be a MIP candidate.  AD has always played third fiddle to Giannis and Rudy when it comes to DPOY. If he can stay healthy and get his BPG back to the 2.5 range, he could finally end up as the DPOY.   Cameron Payne is a little bias from me. but after the playoff run he had, I think monty will use Cameron Payne a lot more to give Chris paul some rest. He could win it   Davion Mitchell has just about everything he needs to be ROTY except for maybe the name recognition. Elite defender, and not a slouch on offence either."
"Bitter 76ers fans: Ben Simmons isn’t a star. He choked in the playoffs, etc.  Also 76ers fans: We will take nothing short of Damian Lillard and 6 first-round picks."
"Yes, Damian Lillard is bringing a championship to Portland, the start of a three-peat that brings Kevin Durant west."
Westbrook’s decline began with a wave from Damian Lillard.
Damian “Old Soul” Lillard
"Ok, TJ McConnell.... his rookie year he had more assists and less turnovers per 100 possessions than LaMelo.   If you discount per 100 possessions, and prefer just totals per game balancing assists and turnovers:   Damian Lillard  Elfrid Payton  Ricky Rubio  Ben Simmons Trey Young  Lonzo Ball MCW   So not a ton, but certainly not groundbreaking/generational"
"Of course, you have Stephen Curry, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard. Above them is future HOFer Trey Murphy III."
Let me first state that I am talking about the Damian Lillard of today. Not Dame from a few years ago who I consider to be a worse player.  Second: I don't think it's fair at all to use rTS% when the league now shoots better as a whole. It's quite disingenious.   Third: Why do we only look at post-season performance if you're skeptical about the small sample size? Dame's last two seasons have been 38.1 and 39.2 points per 100. The most Nash ever scored in a regular season was 27.8 per 100.  I still believe Lillard to be a superior scorer than Nash. It's possible that Nash would be better but I am skeptical. Nash is the better playmaker of course so I believe them to be on a smilar tier offensively.   The point being that in my opinion **it's not unreasonable** at all to suggest Nash might not be better than Dame if he were to play in today’s league.
Isn't the logo 3 more associated with Damian Lillard nowadays?
"Wasted depends on what you want. If your goal is to trade Simmons then yeah, time wasted. If your goal is to get a [star player](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10009930-76ers-rumors-goal-is-less-to-trade-ben-simmons-and-more-to-acquire-damian-lillard), then not necessarily, you're just buying time and making the most of a crappy situation.  Morey seems to be very cool with waiting. Maybe someone like Lillard or Beal becomes available, but I wouldn't bet on it. Either way, he probably thinks that better returns will come from waiting, otherwise Simmons would be gone already."
"""That's a bad thot""  - Damian Lillard"
"I'm surprised you didn't already drown yourself in liquor after seeing Westbrook, Draymond, Dwight Howard, and Damian Lillard over Wade."
The only one that gets me scared for them is the sixers if Joel goes down at all and they have to rely on a Drummond who wants to prove he's better than Embiid. I think they'll be well seeded and get Damian Lillard with a Ben + Maxey + something + picks package tho so.  This year is so damn difficult because a lot of teams are actually good  Nets  Heat  Bucks  76ers  Hawks    ____  Jazz  Lakers  Suns  Mavs  Warriors
"That’s not a better comparison lmao. Draymond Green is not a zero on offense, he’s one of the better passers in the league. On top of that, I’m talking about PRIME IT, the one that was in MVP talks.   All the players you named are all POSITIVES on offense. As great as Draymond is, his peak is considered when? When he could shoot the basketball and was known as a top 20 player.   There are plenty top tier players who are only good at offense. KAT is one, Trae, Luka, Curry, Lavine, even Damian Lillard is literally one of the worst defensive players in the league. All these players are considered slightly below average to flat out garbage.   There’s nobody on these guys level who is only good at defense, and Gobert is the only one who even comes close. He averaged 14. Come on bruh."
"Love that draymond is ahead of people like Allen iverson, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Patrick Ewing,Kevin Garnett,Steve nash, Isaiah Thomas, Ray Allen and dirk. Laughable"
1. Damian Lillard 2. Kevin Garnett 3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Penny Hardaway 5. Tracy McGrady
"Kobe, Jason Williams, IGGY, Damian Lillard, Shaq"
1. Reggie Miller 2. Darius  Miles 3. Jordan 4. Stacey Augmon 5. Damian Lillard
1. Rasheed Wallace 2. Charles Barkley 3. Tim Duncan 4. Damian Lillard 5. Dirk
"&gt; ""No matter how unrealistic it sounds, Portland's Damian Lillard remains the type of starry target Morey seeks.""  Man this is the most boring/weird standoff I've seen"
Paul George &gt; Damian Lillard. PG over a lot of guys tbh
There are very few defenders worse than Damian Lillard. Trae is one of them which is sad
&gt; Philadelphia 76ers receive: Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal  Confirmed. The author is a 76ers fan. :)

https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-on-portlands-head-coach-opening-jason-kidd-is-the-guy-i-want-043651102.html
Damian Lillard made a big fuss implying the Wolves organization was racist because we didn't consider David Vanterpool for our HC position and now that he is in a position to ensure that Vanterpool gets an interview he's out here lobbying for Jason Kidd.  I really like Lillard but that shit bothers me.
"maybe. it was during Rondo’s third week with the team   from AP:  &gt; The Clippers harassed Damian Lillard into 2-of-14 shooting for 11 points, well under his team-leading 29.6 average.   &gt; A frustrated Lillard earned a technical foul in the third. He had just four points in the second half.  &gt; “Just trying to keep ball out of his hands and really trying to make everything tough on him,” Jackson said. “It was a great game plan.”  also (on offense)  &gt; The Clippers scored 47 points in the first quarter, the most in that quarter in franchise history, while shooting 64%.   &gt; George’s 22 points were the most by a Clipper in the first since Blake Griffin had the same on March 10, 2014, against Phoenix   &gt; Portland coach Terry Stotts called his team's defensive effort in the first “embarrassing.”  and to think Clippers could have played Portland lol  is why I really doubt LAC purposefully tanked—why would they “choose” DAL when they spanked POR all year lol 🍑👋"
"Woj: ""Damian Lillard to be player-coach of the Blazers in 2021-2022 season"""
"Well with franchise corner stone Damian Lillard being voted to all-defensive team so many times, it's obviously the coach's fault."
"I have semi mixed feelings - mostly feelings that it was time for him to go.   He obviously did at least okay, getting the Blazers to the playoffs for 8 outta 9 years, but that’s not what teams shoot for, especially a team with Damian Lillard.   It just feels like a Mark Jackson and Steve Kerr kind of situation. He was good, but not Portland’s championship coach"
"The athletic is reporting Lilliard wants Kidd, lol.  https://theathletic.com/2634209/2021/06/05/terry-stotts-out-in-portland-and-damian-lillard-says-he-likes-jason-kidd-or-chauncey-billups-the-two-likely-choices/"

"The dude's actually just a bad coach man. There genuinely isn't another way to say it  He failed miserably for the Bucks and the Hawks. He just lucked into a rookie Damian Lillard here, and that's carried him ever since. Because you could plug any coach in the league into that spot and get a top 10 offense"
"&gt;Damian Lillard wants Doc Rivers as his next head coach, reportedly willing to do whatever it takes to get to Philly  - sources"
Damian Lillard is inarguably a top 5 individual skill player in the league  He can score and pass just as good as Steph.
"Damian Lillard.  I've lived in Portland for his entire career &amp; gotten to see him turn into a superstar.  It's been incredibly rewarding &amp; fun, cannot lie."
"Damian lillard said it best, as long as you keep working when no one is looking, it always comes to light."
They’re going to trade Paul George to the Warriors in a three-way trade that gets them Damian Lillard.
Damian Lillard is also in the convo imo. Everyone knows he's getting the ball at the end of the game
Because James harden is better than Damian lillard
&gt; is James Harden a better player than Damian Lillard this season ?  yes
I would like one Damian Lillard to go please
Coming to the Knicks with Damian Lillard in the trade package  just kidding. i just want him to get a ring i dont care where
At this point I’d say Damian Lillard is a better individual player. Him putting up 8 assists on the season is really overlooked.  BUT Luka fits into his system better and is actually forcing his team to succeed which puts him slightly above.  I believe that swapping CJ and Melo for THJ and Richardson would put Portland in the conference finals lol
Now do Damian lillard
"Lakers already went all in, they got nothing to trade. I don’t think Lebron interested in chasing rings anymore. They just need AD to get healthy and try it again.   I believe this will be slow offseason, Kawhi will sign his Super Max with Clippers. Most clubs cannot give him a max contract over Salary cap threshold.  Portland can only trade Dame to Knicks for draft picks and start rebuilding for next decade. Knicks has a legit chance to sign Kawhi only if they get Lillard but less likely Kawhi would be ready to move out of LA.  Dame to Denver make more sense but Denver has to move on from Jamal Murray + picks, Murray is only 24 not sure Denver would mortgage the future for 31 year old Damian   Most teams made number of trades in past couple of seasons left them with no trade assets including picks in next 5 years"
Not for Damian Lillard?
"Damian lillard has averaged, over the entire time we’ve had tracking data, 42 percent from open 3s. Harden has averaged 41 percent. So according to your reasoning, Damian lillard is just not an elite shooter. Ok thanks, looks like nobody should listen to this guy lol"
"[@Dame\_Lillard  if you had the opportunity to sign with any team in the league today other than trailblazers what team would it be?](https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard/status/875041412332478464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E875041412332478464%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2715685-damian-lillard-i-would-play-for-the-jazz-or-lakers-if-blazers-didnt-want-me)  I mean if you want to know where Dame wants to be, he's already answered it."
Is there another guy named Lillard in the league? Because Portland isn't getting KAT without sending Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr in exchange.
Everyone not named Damian lillard
"I mean making a trade packages heavily implies that you think that. I think it’s more likely Portland fires their entire front office, coaching staff, and trades everyone not named Damian Lillard before they trade him.   He’s made it very clear that he hates players looking to get traded for rings."
"The title of the post is ""realistic Damian Lillard trades"", not ""theoretically possible Lillard trades"""
"This is stupid. If you 3 peat twice you can say whatever the fuck you want. If you whine like a baby about not being selected for an all star team during the most stacked point guard era in the history of the league and then get SWEPT by the Pelicans, you're gonna have to take the L. Maybe you're right and Damian Lillard is saying all of that to force himself to compete. The point is, it's not working."
"You shouldn't.   Wiggins knows his role. CJ doesn't and that's the problem. Hes a liability on defense who thinks he's a Damian Lillard on offense, when he's really more like Lou Will"
"Think about it this way - It's literally just replacing MPJ for Damian Lillard on their current team   That's a huge upgrade, and MPJ is honestly their biggest problem on defense. Dame hunted him relentlessly"
And do you hold the same views about Damian Lillard for walking off after his loss?
"Max said ""You could offer me the entire Knicks roster, every asset they have, would I give up Damian Lillard for THAT? No.""  Lol"
"An asinine trade for the second best PG in the league? It’s a lot to give up, but Damian Lillard is worth the price. That kind of scoring ability next to MVP Jokic’s play making would be amazing.  Take a breath lol it’s too early in the morning to be that heated. You have a long day of r/nba ahead of you. Want an orange slice?"
"Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, Kira Lewis, Naji Marshall, and some picks for Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic?  Pelicans Starting 5: Dame, NAW, BI, Zion, Nurk  Blazers Starting 5: Lonzo, CJ, Cov, Naji, Aquaman"
Damian Lillard and Jared Dudley?
Jamal Murray for Damian Lillard trade. Let’s just get it out of the way
"I’m sure Jokic being a chubby white guy is apart of the media not really being into him but I also think another factor is he isn’t really big into the fame of basketball. He just wants to play and go home. Luka is a white dude and the media has been loving him, in part I bet because he’s kinda a hot head talking shit to the other team.   Lillard is a great player who also makes music and does commercials. To the media he’s cool and Jokic isn’t and they can promote Damian to the casual fan."

"Dame's career vs. Steph's career: not close. Dame's performance right now vs. Steph's performance right now: somewhat close (the two best point guards in the league, putting up absurd performances). I'd agree with that. I mean no disrespect to Damian Lillard. I'm frequently amazed by Dame when I watch Portland play and I was rooting for you guys more than I've ever rooted for any team that's not the Warriors exclusively because of him. I hope he doesn't ever leave Portland and that he gets some help next season."
"On the Nuggets he wasn't. Just like Mason Plumlee starts for Pistons now, but was role player for Nuggets. Because there was **a better player** than him on that team.   What the fuck are you talking about, Jokic didn't bench him. If player A outplays player B and crown knows it, player A did not bench player B. Benching him behind Jokic is not honest? WHAT?! Do you REALLY think that they didn't make him aware that if (more like *when*) a better player comes by, he would get benched?! Jesus Christ.  You din't have to be an All star to have to right to save the career, but you have to be an All Star or more than that to make demands. And one player expecting to have a guaranteed starting spot sure sounds like a fucking demand. Nurkic didn't have the cards to play that game. And he lost. Expectedly for every one but him. He played for goodnes sake, what drugs are you on? Didn't they try Balkan Twin tower shit, what proved that Jokic can't and more like shouldn't play at PF?! Were you even watching NBA then?! And when Malone realised that Jokic is more effective as a C and Nurkic can't play PF to save his life, therefore made Nurkic come of bench, the very next week Nurkic started complaining. And he continued to do that, and would you guess that that type of shit wares off team chemistry. Malone wanted no part of that and basically cut him, which is his right as a coach. Tim Connely stood behind that decision.    Yes, Nuggets ruined Nurkics life, they killed half of his family and threatened to kill other half too. I never blamed Nurkic for asking a trade, I blamed him for acting like a damn bitch after he got traded. You have to be petty with petty people like Nurkic is, because as I said, he continued with petty shit after he got traded.   &gt;As if what you did to him wasn't enough.  I did nothing to him. Nuggets did nothing to him except finding him a great home. He OWES the Nuggets for his situation. Pairing him with Damian Lillard and making him look somewhat good. Nuggets would be bottom feeder if they traded Jokic instead of Nurkic. No one wants to be the bottom feeder."
"I am willing to debate it. Before the ankle injury LeBron put on many great defensive performances, especially in the clutch.

Trust me, I get it, though. Once a narrative catches on it's hard to turn it on its head.   &gt;I only picked TLA's channel because he has non-highlight gameplay.  He also seems to love omitting minutes of gameplay. That along with reading his channel's name makes his agenda clear.   &gt;He's NOT actively finding players to guard, let alone the ball handler  As I clarified in my previous comment, my point was that he's participating in the switching of the defense and switches onto ball handler when needed."
"Don’t do it, Dame.  Think of Damian Lillard Toyota."
"Damian Lillard hugs his teammates (even after how they performed), shakes the opponents hands and walks off. Lebron doesn’t shake hands, doesn’t look at his teammates and storms off. Losing teaches you respect for the league and the game, something that’s pretty foreign to Lebron"
"Ah yes it's been about 15 minutes since the last ""Damian Lillard is loyal"" media story"
"Damian Lillard was eliminated out of the playoffs today with a statline of 28/4/13.  On the same day, the Lakers were eliminated out of the playoffs"

"BREAKING: NEW GM/HC WalksWithKemba trades Damian Lillard for Kemba Walker, immediately fired."
"Well, I'll be honest. I just don't think that the CJ Dame backcourt can work anymore. CJ is just not consistent enough, and quite injury prone. Thought they were getting Rockets Covington, just didn't turn out to be the case. Carmelo and Ant really surprised me though, and I feel that Norm Powell can be a big piece moving forward. I feel like he needed to take a lot more shots in the series.  Everyone has their own opinions, but I think CJ and Stotts have to go if the future of this team is to move forward with Damian Lillard as the man."

"This is exactly why NBA players should not be voting. They’re idiots. They voted the most hood player in the NBA since Allen Iverson as the teammate of the year. Damian Lillard is one of the most overrated players in the league. He’s like every stat-padding, no value adding player that each era has...Jerry Stackhouse, Nick Van Exel, Mitch Richmond. They will score you a lot of meaningless points but never win you championships as the guy. Damian plays Chuck ball, he’s chucking wild shots as if he has a 3-pt percentage like Curry. He doesn’t not even close, mostly because of talent but also because of terrible shot selection. This past season he shot 39% from 3-pt and has a career % of 37%. Why does he act like he’s 50/50 from downtown? He makes nobody on his team better, plays defense half the time but gets the title of Dame Time because he’s makes clutch shots from time to time. I hate hood ball. I would rather have a player like Shane Battier or Ray Allen on my team who play smart disciplined basketball than a hood player who never gets anywhere in the playoffs. Damian and Carmelo are made for each other because they’re both hood players. If I was CJ, I would get the heck out of dodge. You ain’t winning these street ball players. Damian is the most overrated player in the league. There, I said it."
"Damian Lillard... what a great player. Shame Portland couldn't really put the best pieces around him.  Nikola Jokic showed why he's MVP. 36/8/6 in a close-out game, and his teammates stepped up hitting big shots like MPJ (who kept them in the game in the 1st), Monte Morris (who hit the shot to end the 3rd) and Austin Rivers and Aaron Gordon (who hit key 3s to put the game out of reach)."

"Dame just posted a 10 point game with 70% of his points coming from free throws. Yet you’re digging on AD for not being able to score points without getting fouled?  Get the fuck out of here.   Neither players are bad, they’re actually both quite good. But all players have bad games sometimes, even Damian Lillard.  P.s.    Dame did it in 31 minutes. So by average, if he had only played 20 minutes, it would have been roughly 7 points. Much much better than ADs offensive performance."
I stan the love child of Steph Curry and Damian Lillard

Damian Lillard did this. This move was 100% to appease our star.

"You should always maintain confidence in your shot and I admire that about Trae Young. That being said, just because they're clogging the lane and taking away your MO, you don't just keep settling for 30 footers when you're 1-7. You're not Steph Curry or Damian Lillard. Trae is just a 34% three point shooter."

"Not really. It was a good game but most superstars can score 40 on 34 shots. What made the difference was he was able to penetrate the Bucks defense over and over again on the pick and roll. He was making the shots that we would normally expect for him to make (layups, floaters, mid range shots etc.  Getting hot would be Damian Lillard against the Nuggets or KD vs the Bucks where he’s just hitting difficult shot after difficult shot"

"Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr. (born July 15, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Weber State Wildcats and earned third-team All-American honors in 2012. After being selected by Portland with the sixth overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft, Lillard was unanimously voted the NBA Rookie of the Year. Nicknamed ""Dame Time"", he has received six NBA All-Star selections and is one of two players in Trail Blazers franchise history, along with Clyde Drexler, to become a six-time All-Star."
Imo teams should be trying to trade for Kemba Walker not that fraud Damian Lillard

"I think the list is much smaller. People go see games to watch LBJ, Steph, KD, Giannis, and Luka. Those other players are great, but don’t have the same draw that the 5 above bring. Edit: Damian Lillard maybe."
"And is anyone going to discuss how Reggie Jackson has basically been Damian Lillard for the past ten games. At some point he will come down to earth, in fact he’s due to come down to earth. Yes Kawhi went down which is horrible luck for them, but a lot of situations and players have way over exceeded expectations. Their first 2 series the best player who controls it all for the other team was really hurt. Doncic was not right in that game 3 and 4. Besides the horrible loss of Kawhi, everything else has worked out for them to a crazy extent."
"Just to add on, he is not maybe the most versatile defender in the NBA, he actually is. BBall Index Defensive Versatility has him first this season in versatility + second highest for the stat, with his percentage guarding each position being as close to even as you can probably get, for reference they were;  &gt; PG: 21.1% &gt; SG: 17.8% &gt; SF: 18.4% &gt; PF: 27.1% &gt; C: 15.6%  A legit 1 through 5 defender who can defend your teams best defender to great success whether it be Luka through to Embiid.  &gt; Joel Embiid:  9/33 (27%) – 51% for the season &gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo:  27/54 (50%) – 58% for the season &gt; Damian Lillard:  15/37 (40%) – 44% for the season &gt; Luka Doncic:  4/11 (36%) – 48% for the season  OG should legit be in the DPOY conversation he is that good on D, forget about all-defence which he got robbed of last year because apparently we had too many good defenders (weird how that didn't apply to the Sixers this year or Bucks last year) or this year (not enough team success which is the opposite reason he was robbed last year)."
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"You’re so right and it’s one reason why I’ve stopped regularly following the nba. Their marketing is so whack    The only population that actually cares about individual players are kids and teenagers and the only reason they market to them is because that population has a lot of purchasing power. I live in Oregon and most of the people here are blazers fans, not Damian lillard fans. Sure everyone here loves him, but it’s not like people would stop watching the blazers if he left lol.    It’s so annoying and it only gets more annoying the older you get"
"It's just not captivating watching an amalgamation of a groupie's wet dream and some kid's 2k All-Star team. Nothing about that Nets team is interesting or impressive to me.   But the Suns-Bucks potential? Oh my God, to see Chris Paul win a ring like this, or that from-ground-up Bucks team finally go all-the-way? Yes, please. I can only hope the same for Damian Lillard someday, because this shit is organic and genuine."
Damian Lillard and that’s about it.
"To your point about college:   Russell Westbrook averaged 2.5 Assists for his 2 years at UCLA, while Jimmy Butler averaged 1.7 assists for 3 years at Marquette. Both were also SGs and Westbrook had Jrue Holliday &amp; Darren Collision as teammates.  Damian Lillard averaged 3.5 Assists overall in 4 years at Weber State but has always averaged more in the NBA.  We have to keep in mind that in the NBA, everybody is good. So guys are going to put up better assist numbers if they are passing to better players. A guy's college numbers are not always an indication of his pro numbers.  I expect Cunningham to blow that assist number out of the water as a pro. He was the only guy on Oklahoma State that could get his own shot. Without him, no way that team makes it to the Tournament."
Oh no two NBA players trash talked on the court..boo hoo. Damian Lillard totally has never done that before
I'm too lazy right now because it's 4am but look up damian lillard shooting stats from long range. In the past few years he has really accelerated his 3 point percentage and attempts from deep despite being guarded harder there now. He does not shoot 20% on that shot lmao
"&gt; Explain losing in 5 to the pre KD Warriors with Steph Curry out for 3.5 games then? Or losing to the Kawhi-less Spurs by 40 points in an elimination game (after getting blocked on a game tying 3 by 40 year old Ginboli the game before)? Or losing to baby Damian Lillard in his 2nd year?  Literally none of these happened to MVP Harden, the best version of Harden."
"You’re acting like he said Dame is a dogshit person who’s not good at basketball lol. He said it was a bad shot, if Dame missed it everyone would have been like wtf was he thinking. A 40 footer for the game winner when the game is tied is obviously a bad shot and as the defender u can live wit it, Dame is jus a monster.   Then the other trash talk was jus smt like “You getting sent home this year”. How soft do you have to be to be so offended by that, it’s normal trash talk by players. People claim they love when the league was tough and everyone talked shot and then theyre so fuckin quick to get offended on other people’s behalf.

All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
"I read a [solid article](https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/) explaining what kind of coach she is. Basically a player's coach in the mold of Pop (obviously) and someone who's not afraid to push her players. Not to mention she was instrumental in developing the young guys in SA. From the article:  &gt;She’s a noble leader, one who connects with players and teaches them to be the best versions of themselves. Her imprint has made a noticeable impact on the growth and development of young players like Bryn Forbes and Derrick White. Hammon’s guard expertise in her own playing days made her a one-of-a-kind point guard and now, she’s instilling those floor general qualities in the next generation of Spurs.     I'd imagine her background as a guard should help her work with Lillard and, should the team decide to blow it up and trade Damian, she'll be around to mentor any young players they get back."

Also [this](https://twitter.com/CJMcCollum/status/716107313891778560) tweet from CJ, and Dame has been quoted as saying he told AB he was the ""best perimeter defender"" in the league.  And don't forget about this [clutch defense](https://streamable.com/bcy74) on Kyrie to seal a win, that's about as well as you can hope to defend Ky. He was in his bag.  Avery Bradley had the reputation because he earned it"
"""Lemme speak about Damian Lillard! Now we know that this BROTHAA is a RUFF RYDAA! He can pull from THURTY and is one of the most clutch SHOOTAS in the league next to Steph Curry! He is a BAAAD MAN but how can he sit there and let a WHITE MAN manage him after the last one failed!!!! After all that's happened in the UNITED STATES OF MURICA over the past year, it turns out *dramatic pause* us brothas arent united at all."" - Stephen A Smith"
As a New Yorker I will give one Nets Mike D'Antoni for one Damian Lillard to the Knicks please.
"Unless D'antoni has changed his style, this isn't going to change much for Portland. They become a higher seed in the regular season but will have the same issues when the playoffs arrive. They would basically be the Houston Rockets.   That being said, I can see why Damian Lillard would want this appointment. It basically increases his usage and puts him in top 3 of the MVP race every year like Harden was."
"It would be interesting to see what Toronto's coaching &amp; development staff could do with Simmons, and maybe teach him to shoot (and get him to actually do it).  But I don't think the basic math of it works, because it's a bad contract that Toronto doesn't need.  Simmons is due to make:  $31,590,000  $33,930,000 	  $36,270,000 	  $38,610,000  ...over the next 4 years.   He's simply not worth that salary.  And Toronto doesn't need to take-on that salary. --  In contrast, a team like Portland has CJ McCollum who isn't a good fit next to Damian Lillard, and McCollum has a big salary too.  So Portland does need to do something with that salary, and Simmons is a better fit than McCollum.  Philly and Portland are both stuck paying those high salaries, so they may as well do the swap.  But Toronto doesn't need to take on a bad contract."

"Post from yesterday “Portland gets: Ben Simmons, Mattise Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, 2 future 1st Rd Picks, 2 future 2nd Rd picks Philadelphia gets: Damian Lillard” lmao"
"Woj: ""Damian Lillard has informed Trailblazers brass that he would like to be traded.""  ESPN: ""Is Damian Lillard a sexist??!?"""
Damian Lillard?
"Imagine being a star player on another team, let’s say Damian Lillard for example. I’m sure he’s thinking “keep that motherfucker away from me” as all the analysts suggest trading him for CJ MCCollum. I can’t imagine any player on any team wants their owner to trade for Ben right now."
What has Damian lillard accomplished in his 12 years that Trae young hasn’t in 3
Damian Lillard
"We would riot if the Blazers traded Dame, unless he actually asked to be traded. Absolutely not. Why trade Dame for Simmons when you can trade CJ, and keep the superstar? And its the meme of that future talent could be anything, even a Damian Lillard. Dame is the blazers right now, he is the franchise GOAT, no way at all we trade him, the support around the team would go way down. Especially when he has been so loyal to us."
Damian Lillard is repeatedly talked about as a phenomenal teammate and veteran star. Just saying.
there's no market Lmfao he makes damian lillard money
"agree, it's not a binary decision, though.  There are other jobs available this year and if the right one isn't out there she can wait another year if she wants &amp; get the right opportunity.  It'd be great to coach Damian Lillard, I just wouldn't be in a rush to get hired by a GM on the incredibly hot seat who just meat-shielded the last coach to save his job."
"good series, bad series, it doesn't matter. you'll never win a championship with Damian Lillard being the best player on the team.  hell, there's an equal chance that you're getting swept in the first round as there is that you'll get past the first round with Lillard as your best player.  i'm only stating facts."
&gt; Doncic was too good too fast. Kinda the LeBron James problem.  Same thing happened to Damian Lillard but he carried even worse rosters than Luka had on the Mavs this year to higher seeds in the playoff than the Mavs.
trae young &gt; damian lillard
"He’s a good player. Just not a superstar you build a franchise around. I mean He could’ve won dpoy this year.   He is what he is. And that’s not Steph curry or Damian Lillard. He’s A defensive minded, borderline pass-only point guard. Who’s got great court vision, and is very good at running the offense.    Everyone whines about giannas taking and not making 3s. But then gets on Simmons for not taking them."
"An act of god or the leadership of Damian Lillard. CJ for Simmons, let's fucking do this."
Well Portland would have Damian lillard so I don't see how it's not similar especially right now
"Some players just don’t care, eg. Damian Lillard has never gotten a triple double either"
"Doesn't Simmons have any coaches? Is he so special that he needs  Damian Lillard as a coach?  That's like me saying the Math HW is too hard, I need Fermat to help me."
In what world do the Trail Blazers trade Damian Lillard for Ben Simmons. Even with hella picks it's a tough sell
"Personally, I'd just sit him for a year.  He might be a generational talent, but he doesn't have the desire to grind to match it (ex. Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard).  Too rigid and too demanding?  Imagine saying that to Kobe and Michael.  They'd rip you to shreds.    He's a below average defender.  Maybe he should work on that and get everyone on his team to do the same.  That's what their biggest issue was this season that Van Gundy kept saying they needed to focus on and it fell on deaf ears.  At this point, it's the players who are sabotaging their own success and they can't blame anyone but themselves.  Perhaps being benched for a year will humble him and gets him out of this immature mindset.  They need to draw the line in the sand to him and his family.  You want out?  Fine, but you're gonna sit a few years and I'm not sure how good he'll be without having played competitively for that long potentially."
"I wonder what Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum are doing?  Oh yeah, pelting bananas at their TV this entire game."
"I swear Harden stans must not know how to read. I picked his biggest choke. He has choked like 10 times but that was his worst.  Some more:  2012 Finals vs Miami (the first of many)  2013 vs OKC (7/22 in lost elimination game)  2014 vs Blazers (destroyed by sophomore Damian Lillard)  2015 vs Clippers (one of his worst)  2015 vs Warriors (before they signed KD, classic Harden elimination game with 14 points and 12 turnovers)  2016 vs Warriors (before they signed KD, Curry missed 3 games and Houston still lost in 5)  2017 vs Spurs (probably his worst. Jonathan Simmons destroyed him lmao)  2018 vs Warriors (Harden misses 10 straight 3s in game 7, Rockets blow 11 point halftime lead. Was against Warriors with KD so I give him a bit of a pass)  2020 vs Thunder (4/15 1/9 on 3s in game 7, carried by Russ and Eric Gordon)  2021 vs Nets (5/17 and 2/12 on 3s)  In 5 career game 7s he has shot 34/91 from the field, 11/49 from 3, with 21 turnovers  He has choked far more than any other player who is considered a superstar. Every year he shrinks in big games. It's ok you don't need to defend him anymore. He's embarrassing the Nets in the playoffs now."
Booker is 24 years old and you consider him downhill from now on? Meanwhile Damian Lillard (my fav non-Suns player) is 30 and you have him in prime for another 1-2 years. Wtf
Ok so you’ve named Damian Lillard as the only player in the league you’d be interested in trade Simmons for and I’m the delusional Simmons apologist? The only trade package you came up with for Simmons was for a top 5 player in the league lol.
"Respect the effort, but why not just use Game Score?  &gt; 1. Damian Lillard - 55.90 - 2021-06-01 - POR  &gt; 3. Kevin Durant - 50.40 - 2021-06-15 - BRK  &gt; 28. Jayson Tatum - 41.80 - 2021-05-28 - BOS  &gt; 48. James Harden - 40.50 - 2021-05-28 - BRK  &gt; 56. Devin Booker - 39.90 - 2021-06-03 - PHO  &gt; 81. Khris Middleton - 38.70 - 2021-06-17 - MIL  &gt; 85. Kevin Durant - 38.50 - 2021-05-30 - BRK"
"Same energy when Dame does it, (same when anyone does it), but he didn’t play this evening.  Harden did.  I posted this during a Bucks-Nets game.  Like, *right* after Harden flailed into a foul.  If you wanted a diatribe on Damian Lillard this evening you should have talked him into a postseason run."
"AD says hello. citations: AD on Damian lillard, harden, westbrook, butler in 2020 playoffs"
"They're going to get Damian Lillard this offseason, aren't they...?"
"Kevin ""Damian Lillard"" Durant"
Why the fuck is Jrue dribbling out the shot clock like he's Damian Lillard?
Damian Lillard has improved his game every single season and is known for his workouts. From Weber State to All-NBA doesn’t happen without putting in massive amounts of gym time. Plus he’s put on at least 20 lbs since his rookie season and hasn’t lost a step.
so damian lillard (but not tonight)
Damian Lillard can eat my ass.
He’s actually pretty good I feel like Blazers fans shit talk him so they can prop up Damian Lillard by pretending he has no supporting cast  Edit: 23 ppg with 57% TS is pretty great lol
"You're right, my point was dismissive of what you're saying. I agree that Westbrook's play at very least seems to define every team he plays on - however, I don't think we honestly have seen Westbrook on good teams enough to make those conclusions. When OKC was a good team, he made it to the NBA finals with the highest playoff usage rate on the team. Even after Harden left, his team made the WCF and went up 3-1 on the 73-9 warriors. Both of those alone are more ""winning"" than someone like, e.g. Damian Lillard has ever done, despite not being labelled a ""non-winning player"" like Westbrook.  And it is true that Lillard never had a team as good as 2012 OKC, and that's why he gets a pass - but Westbrook's reputation as a ""losing player"" was developed under similar/worse circumstances. His MVP season team had a pre-breakout Jerami Grant as its second best offensive option. Making the playoffs with that team was an outright miracle. The PG seasons were disappointing, but they were never considered real contenders during that time regardless. And when he went to Houston, I wouldn't say that team re-adapted itself to be a ""Westbrook-style"" team - so I don't think he necessarily can't fit into systems, and I don't think we can call him a non-winning player for dragging bad teams to the playoffs since he has in fact been an NBA finals point guard."
My opinion? Damian lillard will definitely play NBA basketball this upcoming season
"Damian Lillard came into the league like 3-5 years after guys like Steph, Harden, Durant, Westbrook, etc yet he’s basically the same age.  I’m also surprised to see that Jayson Tatum is still 19."
"I agree, Damian Lillard is a good example of that."
"&gt;10. Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers) Stats: 28.8/4.2/7.5 with 45.1/39.1/92.8 splits and 62.3%TS Team Performance: 42-30, 6th seed in the West, 4-2 loss in **the 2nd round** to Denver  /u/Rockstar408 Portland lost in the first round btw. but thanks for the informative and high-quality post."
Damian Lillard kids wanted to leave because he hit a series winning buzzer beater in their face
Bucks with Damian Lillard beat the Sixers with Lowry.  Checkmate.
"Sounds like you graduated with really good grades, helping small market nba teams make it in this competitive league.  This is such a good idea. Do you think Anfernee Simons would sign the exact contract that dame has if he had to change his name to ""Damian Lillard""?"
Might as well put every young player in the league there then.  There's no reason to think either player ever has the peak of Damian Lillard.
Just trade everyone and everything for both Beal *and* Lillard. Find some scrubs off the street (like Damian Jones) to play bigs while having 4 insane guards on your team.
Damian B Lillard trade piece incoming.
Taj Gibson for Damian Lillard straight is the best deal the blazers can get. Its 100% even
"I wouldn’t trade a Happy Meal for Wiseman, 7 and 14. Let alone Damian Lillard"
[Dame 6s](https://www.kixify.com/product/adidas-dame-6-gca-damian-lillard-black-pink-gold-men)
"\#11, #12, #14, #18 are the most talented. But most likely #12 would win between all these because they have a combination of size (AD, Draymond, Middleton) for rebounding, Shooting (Damian, Khris), slashing with Beal, and at least *some* playmaking with Draymond and lillard. AD and Draymond would make the interior defense legendary, but Lillard would handicap the perimeter defense a bit.   \#18 has insane playmaking potential but not enough rebounding. #14 is really good but not enough shooting. The lane would be too clogged. #11 is the most stacked offensively but too small."
"Aka ""we will only accept players with the first name 'Damian' and the last name 'Lillard'"""
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
He’s nowhere close to jokics current level and their is 0 scenarios where he gets there.  “How close is Fred VanVleet to Damian Lillard?”
My respect for Jrue Holiday launched to next level when he single-handedly shut down Damian Lillard in that first round pelicans-blazers sweep
"Damian Lillard, Perfect situation for him to win, Dame leads the blazers to the 3rd seed and shocks all of the haters(Fans who want him on their team) and averages 35/5/10 on 48/40/92."
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors."
"As long as you have Damian Lillard, you trade only to make your current roster better and not for future picks.  Means, they can give up future picks, but not collect future picks.  Once they give up CJ for 1st Round Picks, Lillard is guaranteed gone. The only possibility to keep him, is to make this year a push.  Means trading all your future assets away to make your current roster better."
Damian Lillard joins the sixers
"Sorry, 0/4.   &gt;!damian LilLard!&lt; &gt;!bam AdeBayo!&lt; &gt;!kevin DuRant!&lt; &gt;!khris MiddleTon!&lt;"
"yes he faced better teams. He literally beat the team that destroyed giannis that year….  he also beat james harden and russell westbrook, Jokic, and damian lillard. 3 of those players are mvps now…"
"i know y'all hate CP3 but if someone say that CP3 is slightly better than Damian Lillard, y'all shouldn't be mad.  CP3 defensive capability is very underrated. Dude is shorter than dame but doesn't get abused by anyone not named giannis"
"I feel like people look at the 2014 Rockets-Blazers series and assume Damian Lillard was the best player on the team for those games, but LaMarcus Aldridge was unstoppable at times against a still elite Dwight Howard. I think he deserves the recognition of getting the team to the conference semis."
As in I think Tatum can be in the Paul George/Damian lillard/Russell Westbrook tier but I think Zion can be in the Durant/Shaq/Curry tier
"For someone he has been labeled as bad or mediocre shooter before, Mitchell has one of the cleanest strokes in the league and can go full Damian Lillard when he's hot."
"Damian Lillard makes the Blazers a ton of money though. The Blazers are like 13th on revenue, there’s a good chance they drop towards the bottom of they commit to fully tanking"
watching damian lillard is fun. i bet they want to go all in.
1 Giannis or 2 Lukas Luka   1 Giannis or 5 Bobby Portis Giannis   1 Giannis or 3 Javale Mcgee Giannis   1 Giannis or 2 Damian Lillard Dame   1 Giannis or 2 Anthony Davis Ad   1 Giannis or 6 Larry Nance Jr Giannis   1 Giannis or 3 Chris Pauls Giannis   1 Giannis or 5 Hardens Harden   1 Giannis or 2 Kyries and 3 Bol Bols Giannis   1 Giannis or 13 Dwight Howard's Giannis   1 Giannis or 3 Sexlands Giannis
"""Portland Gives McCollum - gets 2 first round picks and wiseman""  Yup this will make Damian Lillard stay. /s"
"Overrated overall - Damian Lillard. He is a high volume scorer on a large volume shooter, but he hasn’t won, he is short, can’t play good defense and isn’t an exceptional playmaker for a point guard."
Paging Damian Lillard…
"An inorganic collection of superstar Talent, I'd say three Superstars or two top fiveish players combined with another perennial All-Star       Like I don't consider Duncan, Ginobili and Parker to be a super team, that's just damn good drafting    I don't know what the hell Stephen Jackson was thinking saying that Milwaukee of Greek Freak, Chris Middleton and Jrue Holiday wasn't superintendent      The Nets were not a super team until they added James Harden     The Golden State Warriors were not a super team, until they added Kevin Durant       I don't consider the late 90s Bulls to be a super team, now people might push back on that I will say they were a super team from a defensive standpoint, but Rodman just wasn't going to give you anything offensively and it was looked at as a super risky move at the time but if you want to call it 1, I'm not going to have a huge monster debate with you          And I would not consider the 2020 bubble Lakers a super team now if they had Westbrook or Damian Lillard or whoever the hell they're planning on adding this year, then yes that elevates them to super team status"
"2 Lukas. Trade one for a better complimentary star. If that's cheating, I still think 2 Lukas is just too crazy good.   Giannis &gt; 5 Bobby Portis. You can get Bobby Portises in free agency. You can't just get a MVP.   1 Giannis &gt; 3 Javale Mcgees. My dude.   1 Giannis &gt; 2 Damian Lillard. This is close. 2 Dames don't compliment each other that well, and Giannis is so much surplus value over a max contract whereas Dame is worth his max, maybe a little more.   2 Anthony Davis. One will be healthy, right?  1 Giannis &gt; 6 Larry Nances Jr. See Portis  1 Giannis &gt; 3 Chris Pauls. Assuming current CP3. Prime CP3 a different matter.   5 Hardens. I will exchange one Harden for one Gobert and collect my championships until the team blows up.   1 Giannis &gt; 2 Kyries and 3 Bol Bols. I'd rather have 2 Dames.   1 Giannis &gt; 13 Dwight Howards. 13 Dwights would bring so many baby mommas to the game we wouldn't have seats for paying fans.   1 Giannis &gt; 3 Sexlands I'm too tired for a good meme answer here."
You hear that Damian Lillard? Stay loyal and true.
"It amazes me how easy people think getting a triple double is. Like you just walk on the court and grab it easy. Damian Lillard has 1...in his whole career. I understand they are completely different players. But, I think Russ is unreasonably disrespected. And I'm a Blazers fan. Nothing better than watching Dame wave that Thunder team into a rebuild. But shit...gotta respect his hussle."
damian lillard took the most shots in the all star game
Kevin Knox for Damian lillard Julius randle for fuckin korkmaz Ben Simmons for Elfrid payton
its the fucking championship you'd better believe if damian lillard won finals MVP i'm gonna fucking drive after him into the drive through the morning after
"Uhhhh no. I'm going to name 11 guys, and then ask how the fuck you justify ranking Devin Booker ahead of any of them (in no particular order):  1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Nikola Jokic 4. LeBron James 5. James Harden 6. Anthony Davis 7. Joel Embiid 8. Steph Curry 9. Damian Lillard 10. Kawhi Leonard 11. Luka Doncic"
"Of course they can, just read instagram and youtube comments. Kuzma, KCP, and 2 firsts will land them Damian Lillard"
Can they make a Damian Lillard order?
Trade Damian Lillard to the knicks for Kevin Knox and Taj Gibson 🤑🤑🤑 it would be a steal
"1. Lebron 1 ring as only super star 2. Curry 1 ring as only super star 3. Giannis 1 ring as only super star 4. KD 0 rings as only superstar 5. Kawhi 1 ring as only superstar 6. Westbrook achieved an unimaginably impressive feat of averaging a triple double, then did it 3 more times. Hes on his own shelf as a unique all time talent.  7. Harden  8. Damian Lillard 9. Chris Paul 10. Carmello"
"Yeah my basketball knowledge is shocking for properly rating Damian Lillard, one of the deadliest scoring guards we've seen in league history. FOH."
"&gt;  Like look at the undefeated pats, if they just lost in the playoffs/not superbowl it would've been bad but not as bad as it was.  I was ready to follow you down this road but then you put this. If they lost in the first or second round it would have been even worse than it was. This is like the 72-9 warriors losing in the 2nd round to Damian Lillard. People would absolutely still be talking about that choke job today (and not for Damian), whereas because they made the finals people talk more about the team that managed to beat them."
"Happy Giannis won, this is great for the league. Damian Lillard once mentioned players now a days “running from the grind”. And it’s true. Players all joining up and running to the same 3 states is tiring. Giannis proved himself by staying loyal and believing into himself, his team and city. A part of feels LeBron ran off from Cleveland by panicking after a flameout in the playoffs. Bron was like 26, same as Giannis. Giannis certainly had his flameouts. But as you can see, a injury here, one trade there etc Things worked itself out. This ring honestly hold more weight than any LeBron Miami ring, KD ring, or even AD ring."
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
Damian Lillard to the Suns? He can replace CP3
"This ain't Kevin Love, it's motha fuckin Damian Lillard.   If he wants to get traded, he'll get traded."
"I know this post is a few days old but when I say build around Dame what I mean is stuff like:  A) Wasting time and money on old bums like Carmelo Anthony to ""win now"" instead of developing.. anyone else.  B) Signing CJ to a long, big contract extension shortly after Damian Lillard signed his supermax.  This one is very damaging.  This extension is just now kicking in, despite being signed shortly after Dame signed his supermax.  If Dame forces his way out this summer, they will be left with CJ's extension kicking in and they'll have to find a way to unload him now, possibly giving up assets just to do it because moving contracts like that isn't easy, despite him being a good player.  So not only will it be work to get rid of him they were also robbed of actually getting assets for him a year or so ago.  C) In a ""win now"" move, traded 22 year old rookie contract Gary Trent Jr for Norman Powell who just opted out and is now a FA.  What happens if Dame leaves?  Worst case they just RIP'd an asset, best they sign Norman to a big new deal and try to move him in the future.   We could rattle off examples for days, like how they don't have a 2021 draft pick because they traded it for Robert Covington.  So to respond to your initial statement, which offers a valid point but imo comes to the wrong conclusion.  They indeed did build around Dame, they just didn't do it very well.  It's also worth noting, given CJ's extension following shortly after Dame's that Dame himself very well may have been a vocal factor in this move.  As he was in wasting time on washed up Melo.  It's not something we haven't seen before, if franchises completely give in and essentially make their star the GM of the team it can backfire in the future (ie lebron with cleveland, and I see you with that lakers icon, if they aren't careful them too).  At least with LeBron he might leave your franchise desolate but you get a ring out of it so can't complain too much."
"Acting like Lillard wouldn’t have made a difference in the series is hilarious. It just goes to show you can’t even have an objective conversation.   And again, if you didn’t catch it the fist time. Comparing Damian Lillard being injured to rondo and Avery Bradley is just pathetic. The Lakers played one healthy team all playoffs, those are facts."
Work on a jumper before Morey trades your ass to Oregon for Damian Lillard.
It ain’t happening if they’re not included lol  This is Damian Lillard we’re talking about. Ben’s stock is garbage right now and those picks are likely going to be dogshit with how good the Sixers would be with Lillard and Embiid.
"Among today's players: Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard are the two players where if you blacked out their face and jersey numbers and just had me watch their shadows onscreen, I'd still be able to tell it was them. I don't know if they're the most aesthetically pleasing but they're very distinctive in the way they shoot."
What does the word Damian Lillard mean to you?
100 times less vomit inducing than the garbage we saw during the Zion draft  - Rachel Nichols also tried using Kobe’s death as a valid reason lebron should win MVP  - she also asked Damian Lillard if he felt bad trying to win on a night dedicated to beyond which is beyond ridiculous   - she also sounds like a prepubescent hamster  So yeah I’m pretty comfortable saying Taylor is better at her job than Nichols is
They have Damian Lillard and Kevin Durant....that would be enough playmaking for the NBA Finals. It should be enough playmaking for the Olympics.
"Lots of comments about point guards and 3s, but the us brought Damian Lillard and shot almost 42% from 3.  The us lost on the boards at -12, think about how 12 extra possessions in a close one"
Wasn't Damian Lillard playing?
Y’all know Damian Lillard is on this team right?
……Damian Lillard?
Wonder if Damian Lillard stans were still saying he had no help when US lost to Nigeria
Damian Lillard not a point guard anymore?
Lol. Imagine thinking Damian Fucking Lillard SHOULDN’T be on the Olympic team.
Maybe but I’m picking the team led by Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard over the one led by Precious Achuiwa and Ekpe Udoh
You’re surprised a team led by Damian Lillard underperformed?
lol zack Lavine really thought he was gonna get to play with kd Damian lillard and jt when he’s only playing with the garland and draymond
"Chet is more than lanky lol, my man looks malnourished   Banchero is a legit 6’10 forward with the skillset of Lebron, shit is insane. And Jaden Hardy reminds me of Damian Lillard &amp; James Harden combined. Not to mention Nikola Jovic: Jokic with hops. Next years class is insane"
My mom thinks Damian Lillard is adorable.
"I said this earlier, but what if the Nuggets offered Murray and another piece, like a lightly protected first round pick, for Damian Lillard?   Portland can get started on a rebuild since it doesn't appear they're going anywhere, but also lock up a young player and maybe get another pick out of it. They also have to sit Murray for a year, so they can be real bad and get their own pick pretty high.   For the Nuggets, they get a star, one whose shown he has no problem being in a small market, and take some pressure off of Jokic. They get someone who's a real closer. It's a win-now trade for the Nuggets, but I think it's a good move for them."
Jrue has been somewhere between bad and awful scoring wise every series other than the Hawks   R1: 15.3 ppg on 53.2 TS%  R2: 15.1 ppg on 42.8 TS%  R3: 22 ppg on 55.4 TS%  R4: 10 ppg on 36.3 TS%  Nobody’s asking him to be Damian Lillard but it’s unacceptable to be that inefficient as a third option being spoon fed open looks most of the time as well as missing bunnies at the rim.
Damian Lillard or Zion Williamson from this list. But realistically I don't think we see any big swings this off season.
Makes me feel like I could be an access journalist by calling up reception at the Lakers FO and asking if they’re aware that Damian Lillard is a player who exists and currently plays in Portland.
"Chris Paul is not leaving the Suns and the Suns sure as hell aren’t gonna trade him for Brooklyn’s garbage. If Chris Paul is getting traded for anyone, it’ll be for Damian Lillard, and that probably won’t even happen. Suns in 4."
"Not everyone is deserving of a shot at being a head coach.  If the wolves defense was looking good then he would certainly be the wolves HC right now or the HC on some other team.  Yeah maybe he'd be a good head coach but again, not everyone deserves a crack at it.  And he certainly didn't give much of a reason to give him a shot at it.  The biggest positives about him is Damian lillard likes him , thats the only reason Wolves fans were excited about him in the first place."
"No, I think *you're* lost because it's a Dame comparison thread and people are trying to compare style of play, not levels of success at their relative ages.   From the OP.   &gt;What young player in the nba is most like Damian Lillard, who plays with a similar **playstyle**.  Bolded the keyword for you in case you miss it"
"He wanted the reporter to say ""What it;s like to guard Damian Lillard?"", not ""What it's like to TRY to guard Damian Lillard?""."
Here's to hoping for a Damian Lillard meltdown lol
"This is classic Damian Lillard. Guy is such a fuckin fake. He comes out with this huge article with Haynes about how ""Lillard hasn't been feeling great especially with the beloved Portland fans talking shit about the Billups hire. Dame doesn't wanna leave but he may have to!"" And then he acts like ""oh I never said anything."" Like dude, just say you want out because the team sucks at building and their options are extremely limited. Don't beat around the bush and pretend to be on a moral high horse just because the media jumped on the Billups hire. He's clearly so concerned with his image and is manipulating everyone here."
"Damian Lillard is another example, he's missed 47ft in his playoff career.  Kyrie Irving was the other notable I could find, he missed 36ft in his playoff career.  Nash is easily the most impressive though, he has the interesting combination of elite ft%, and large number of games played, while still getting to the line so infrequently (3.7/game) that he was able to play 120 games and only miss 44."
"he do be in the finals though, im sure it could be a whole lot worse (see: damian lillard)"
Devin Booker would be a true superstar if he was a better three-point shooter. Someone like Damian Lillard would've pulled up on that play without hesitation
There's a non-zero chance he's on the injured list next year with case of hysterical blindness.   Maybe Portland will trade Damian Lillard for this almost an all time great project?
Damian Lillard sold his soul to the devil for basketball skills confirmed.
"I'm not for a second saying he has an obligation to be honest. it'd be better to say nothing than say ""words have been put in my mouth"" days after Haynes writes this:  &gt;The enormous backlash from the Portland Trail Blazers' process to hire a new coach and his concerns on whether a championship contender can be built have become factors that may push the franchise player — Damian Lillard — out the door, league sources told Yahoo Sports.  &gt;Lillard has remained loyal to Portland in large part due to the tremendous fan base. But over the last few days, he’s seen some of those same fans attacking him on social media for a pending coaching hire he played no part in consummating, sources said.  lie, deny, ignore, whatever, but being indignant about a story you planted is pretty funny."
Doesn’t matter. Difference between greatness (team accomplishments) and who is better (real raw talent/ability). Damian Lillard at his peak is one of the best pgs of all time.
Damian Lillard is the Antichrist confirmed.  What was the devil’s sons name in the omen? Coincidence? I think not!
Damian “Satan” Lillard
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
The criteria that I way very little is how many championships they have. A player like MJ can stand on his own without the rings argument. Something I weigh heavily is how many series clinching 3 point buzzer beaters a player has. This is why Damian Lillard is in my top 10.
Tell that to the untold legions of Lakers fans on Twitter who refuse to stop photoshopping Damian Lillard in a Lakers jersey.
OP go use the search feature and type in Damian Lillard then filter it to recent.  Count how many threads there were and tell me in 3 weeks once you’re finally finished
Jrue Holiday (already is tbh)  LeBron James  Damian Lillard  Nikola Vucevic  Kyle Lowry
"As a Knicks fan, Damian Lillard plus Myles Turner."
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
Damian Lillard
Damian Lillard will be early in his prime at age 33?
"So fair warning I think the bucks are a shit team with GA and I highly unlike them with Giannis, they form a give Giannis the rebound play to pad the stats sheet. Their current record after winning the ECF with Giannis being largely missing is just 6–5. Call me ignorant, etc. But after watching Game 1 with ""injured"" Giannis (compared to Dragic who played with a torn plantar fasciitis last year a real injury)  I now believe after watching the Bucks all post season they would need to trade Giannis + DiVicenzo for Damian Lillard to win a 2nd chip even if they do win it this year. Lopez has more blocks per game than Giannis and is a far better shooter at the 3 point line and free throw line. Sure Giannis scores more points per game and assists per game but seeing GA play and stunt the Bucks was a very boring match Both KM, JH and BL score less ppg than in ATL series and going back to their ""former self"" after the 8th minute in the 1st Quarter vs Suns, the bucks beat a ""full"" ATL team that was hungry for its first final with Trae Young without GA speaks volumes of the talent and bench they assembled this year vs Last year bubble bucks.. I find it dull and lethargic when Bucks play with Giannis and that's what destroyed them this Game 1.      I don't discredit the fault of Bud and his coaching staff but unless he's let go of his position after winning this NBA champ (if they do beat Suns) Bucks have switched their entire team minus Giannis, Khris and Lopez in the past 3 seasons several times and have come up short. I'm not hopeful of them retaining their Chip title after beating pretty much injured and shell teams next year. But if the east is going to be ""competitive"" for the west and make it harder for the Heat to get into ECF i think Giannis has to reinvent himself or be traded to make room for a better talent Bucks need overall regardless of the coach."
"“Do you want to talk about the black careers that he put a foot on because he was threatened by ... do you want to talk about the news readers - with an S - of diverse backgrounds that have reports with players that Adrian doesn’t have ... but he (Adrian) can’t talk to Lebron, he can’t talk to Chris Paul or Damian Lillard, or some of these other guys. He doesn’t have report with them”.  It’s not really hard to see what he is getting at is it? Woj destroys black careers because they can connect with black players and he can’t."
Whatch Damian Lillard Game 5 performance in the playoffs this year. That sums up basketball and how it's played today
What if we tanked our game against the nets in the shortened season 2011-2012 and draft damian lillard. Then without doing the lowry trade in search of a new pointguard we use our draft pick in 2012-2013 to pick Giannis.
"Sometimes If you don't join a superteam , you dont' even have a chance to compete.  Exhibit A : Damian Lillard  He played his heart out , but never got a real chance to compete with Warriors.  I really hope He can join with Embiid"
"Damian Lillard, the very definition of empty stats. .350 win percentage in the playoffs, swept in the first round 2 years in a row, knocked out in the first round 4 out of the last 5 years."
Yeah it’s pretty white lol. Diverse in opinions and backgrounds but not so racially. Although I think Orem (or Ogden can’t remember) is where Damian Lillard went to college which is why he likes Utah so much
"&gt; If by ""real point guard"" you mean ""James Harden, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, or maybe Damian Lillard"" you might have a point; otherwise, you have no idea what you're talking about."
"Well James Harden has been better than Westbrook over the last few years, so probably. If by ""real point guard"" you mean ""James Harden, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, or maybe Damian Lillard"" you might have a point; otherwise, you have no idea what you're talking about."
"Yes you are misconstruing   &gt; “I’m not saying Mike D’Antoni doesn’t deserve to be a head coach,” Smith added. “But let him go and get one of them retreads and make them relevant. Why does he always gotta get a Damian Lillard caliber…why do you gotta have someone like that in your stable, because there are plenty of coaches that don’t have that!”  That’s not saying white people shouldn’t be hired. It’s almost the opposite. He’s saying they shouldn’t be given more leeway than other black coaches."
"Even if you don't think he's a staple there, I'd certainly put him in the top 3 for perimeter defense. For the record, Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Paul George (all outstanding offensive players) have all suggested he's a top perimeter defender. Holiday flies under the radar even when he's playing like a madman."
"I mean... props for at least not going with the ""oh yeah they could definitely trade Kuzma, THT, Harrell, and a first for Damian Lillard, that makes perfect sense from Portland's perspective."""
Would the Blazer even talk about trading Damian Lillard to LA?
"The Damian lillard rumors are the worst, why would the blazers trade a stud for 4 bums? No one wants any Knick not named Julius randle"
"If you’re going to use “without him the team is bad” as the reasoning (which is what I think MVP SHOULD be) then Damian Lillard, Jokic, Embiid, Steph, Luka, and many others have him beat.  AD carrying those games while he was out doesn’t help the case"
Damian Lillard?   Pretty sure he's #2 in minutes during that timespan after Jokic...and he's 30 lol  What about Luka?
"I would package him and LeBron for Damian Lillard and Covington. This way, my Lakers would have Lillard and Davis as the younger tandem that will be very good for 3-4 years. LeBron’s been significantly declining on defense each passing year. He’s also getting blocked by guys who could have never blocked him before. I wouldn’t mind selling high now while he has value. It will also free us from having to succumb to the wishes of Klutch of signing their worthless clients like McLemore, Waiters, and JR Smith. Another year of that THT hype that we had to do just because he’s from Klutch and it may become unbearable."
"Chris Bosh wasn’t a superstar bro. An all star obviously, but the guy a total of 1 all nba team in his career and it was a 2nd team.   A lot of people don’t even consider a guy like Damian Lillard a superstar, let alone a Bosh level player"
"Yes, have you not heard Damian Lillard??"
"&gt;I would really dispute that. Those Kings teams were dire.  2016 squad had Gay, Rondo, Collison and some solid roleplayers like Seth Curry, Bellenelli, Koufus. Not world beaters by any stretch but Jokic just had MPJ/Gordon/Rivers + d-leaguers and still beat nuclear mode Damian Lillard.   At the very least it's the same ballpark and that Cousins team had no business being as bad as it was (\~30 wins) if he was anywhere remotely close to the All-NBA level player people are saying he was.   &gt;It's much easier to be efficient on better teams.  And it's easier to volume score on bad teams. Cousins simply wouldn't have been a 25ppg scorer on a contender, and if he's not leading the team in scoring then his other flaws (defense etc) are just highlighted even more."
"Lebron washed friend. Hopefully you guys get Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, and reincarnated prime Michael Jordan to make a run next year."
The two names are: Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard
Damian “Snubbed” Lillard Klay still salty
"I'm overseas. Definitely AI. People know Curry for his highlights but other than that he has pretty much no influence whatsoever.  AI transcended the NBA culture at a time where there wasn't all the social media bs. All over Europe you saw his jersey worn by people who never watched the NBA but knew AI, even counterfeit jerseys were massive on Ebay. If someone was wearing a Curry jersey in a blockbuster i dont know if anybody would show any kind of reaction over here. At the period where Jordan was fading and Kobe took over, Iverson came before Bryant and then was just barely behind him. When you showed someone who Iverson is, there wasn't the question ""is he the best in the NBA"" or something like that, it was Iverson, the style was off the charts and when you watched his highlights you were blown away by what this small dude was doing. You wanted to know who he is and who he is with.  Now compare that to Curry. Curry looks as generic as a human can look. All he is known for is his shot. Some people will say ""Curry transformed the game"" . and it is not true. The 3 has become increasingly important before Curry, already established stars went to the rec center to work on their 3 before Curry. When he arrived there already were others trying the same thing he does. If Curry was on a team like the Kings but did perform exactly the same, he would most likely even be less than a Damian Lillard. Lots of Currys popularity can be attributed to the GSW situation."
"He hasn't added a single all-star to the roster to play with Damian Lillard in nine years. None via trade, draft, or free agency. Worst GM in the league."
if im Sixers GM i'll trade Embiid for Damian Lillard straight up
Damian Lillard then
"I would take this for a grain of salt. Going vegan probably didn't have this much of an effect. For every CP3, there's a Damian Lillard who went vegan and then switched back because it was counterproductive.  Essentially just tryna point out, veganism ≠ increased athletic performance."
can easily get way more if thats what theyre starting with. also smart to just hold on to ben for a while to see how this damian lillard situation unfolds.
"Lmao this one caught my attention   &gt;Its simple, really.  &gt;I move to Ogden, Utah. I’m a new transfer student at Weber State. Who else is there? Damian Lillard. He’s attending an alumni event. I stalk him and learn his routine, and then the next day I bump into him and drop all my books. I apologize profusely, he helps me pick them up. We make eye contact. It’s love at first sight.  &gt;Now this is where things get tricky.  &gt;I invite Dame out to dinner, but I want to do something fancy that isn’t too flashy. We settle on Olive Garden. The date is a success.  &gt;At this point Dame should be in love with me. I confess my love for him too. We elope. I convince him to run away with me to the big city so we can escape our disapproving parents. He agrees. We go to LA.  &gt;Now we’re in the home stretch.  &gt;We get to LA but money is tight. Each of us works 2 jobs but neither can afford rent. We need money, and we need it fast. I meet with the mob and borrow $2 million with an exuberant 200% monthly interest rate. We get in deep with the sharks. After 3 months we owe $36 million and they want their loan back. Uh Oh. I convince Dame he has to work some odd jobs to pay off what we owe. Hiding bodies? Dealing out torture?  &gt;No.  &gt;Theres only one job in LA with a starting sallary of $36 million  &gt;I sign Dame to the LA Lakers.  &gt;we should stay in debt for years so he can never leave.  &gt;Boom. 2020’s Lakers dynasty."
Damian Lillard went vegan a few years back and then un-went vegan
I'm hoping Damian Lillard will join my pickup game team
"&gt;They traded for Dwight Howard  Poverty Lakers franchise managing to convince a player who demanded a trade and threatened to leave for nothing to play for LA, not sure how they did that. Because who wants to play in Los Angeles?  &gt;Why don't you bring up other famous ring chasers who went to other orgs in their twilight years like Barkley? How bought all those ring chasers on the Heat and Cavs with Lebron? The ring chasers on the Warriors. Like bringing up ring chasers is your big argument? Shaq and Lebron are their big free agents acquisitions.  Because LA does it more frequently than anyone else. They don't have nearly as many issues as other teams do when it comes to luring free agents. I guarantee if they traded AD right now, they'd have no issues luring 2022 top free agents to LA and I'd even expect them to be in the mix for Damian Lillard.  &gt;Shaq and Lebron are their big free agents acquisitions.  Poverty Lakers only managing to sign two top 10 players of all time in free agency in a \~20 year span"
"Here's the snippet from the ""report"" in question:  &gt;The Blazers **have shown no inkling they intend** to move on from Damian Lillard or C.J. McCollum, and have a slew of their own free agents—Norman Powell, most notably, plus guaranteeing the $12 million for the final year of Jusuf Nurkić’s contract, which Portland is expected to do—to deal with. Ex-Blazer Nicolas Batum is on Portland’s radar, per a source, with the Blazers projecting to be limited with what they can spend by their $5.3 million mid-level exception.  This is simply speculation from Mannix on what the Blazers might do based on what he had (or hadn't) heard from his or other league sources. The problem with that is that while our FO has its issues, the one thing it has been very good at is keeping roster moves under wraps until they happen. The last time anyone in the org leaked accurate news ahead of time was when LMA was leaving and that assistant got fired.  Essentially, when you hear the Blazers are involved in a trade, it's either not happening or it's already a done deal. It's when you don't hear anything that a trade comes out of nowhere."
I don't necessarily think they have to get rid of CJ. I just would've expected them at some point to make a real win now move.  So far the biggest win now move they've made with Damian Lillard on the roster is... What? Trading for RoCo?

"&gt; I didn't make the Allen comparison you did.  ...and it speaks for itself.  I can't believe you're trying to argue this. Your response was ridiculous and we both know I'm right.     &gt;  But you really can't argue that defense doesn't equally impact the game.  Individually, which I've stated multiple times, I absolutely can.  There's 10+ players in the league right now that are more impactful on offense than Gobert is on defense and he's a 3 time DPOY.  Shit he's better on offense than Lillard, Jokic, Luka etc are on defense....and yet guess which side are the better players?  Shit idk how many examples you need but look at Thybulle.  He's a top 10 defensive player in the game right now.  He plays 20 minutes a game.   A top 10 offensive player is Damian Lillard."
I think that Damian Lillard fellow could really help my squad.
"Back on topic of Ben Simmons... I suspect it has to do with matchups.  In the regular season, he can score. He has the speed to blow by most of the league's defenders. The problem is, he hits a wall vs the elite defenders. And come eastern conference finals. The opposing team will most likely going to have elite defenders.  This isn't only limited to players like Ben, who can't shoot. I suspect Damian Lillard has the same problem. Despite being one of the best shooters in the league. A lot of his points actually come from stringing a run of 2's/getting to the line.   At least in the regular season. Come playoffs. Once you put an elite defender on him. His game is limited to shoot 3's well or lose the game."

"People don’t watch basketball. When they do watch it is a lot of steph curry, damian lillard highlights. They think 3pt is the only way to win and That is not how Lakers, nor Milwaukee won their rings. Ofcourse 3pt shot is important but if you have the best defense in the league paired with extreme half court , transition sets and you are scoring every damn time you come up the court, its going to be real damn hard to stop you. You need someone like Klay Thompson catching fire to stop you and unfortunately neither Klay, nor Steph, nor Damian, or beal or whatever class shooter is available for Kuzma/Kcp."

&gt;4-time NBA Finals MVP Damian Lillard is today.  If the finals was played during the first round and being eliminated is the goal then yes.
"And delusional and casual fans dares to compare this man with Damian Lillard, lol such disrespect"
"I get it, but it’s all relative.  The following generations always have a head start. They get to “stand on the shoulders of giants.”  They get to start where the previous generation left off, after it took a lifetime to get there.   In 50 years, Martian Basketball Association 3rd string point guard D’Jaylen Šploööńgébõrger (old-fashioned Martian name) of the last-place Mars Sector III Digiwaves will be better than HoFer and 4-time NBA Finals MVP Damian Lillard is today."
Damian Lillard. His fans act like he's paying their bills the way they talk about him.
1. LeBron 2. Steph 3. KD 4. Harden 5. Kawhi 6. Westbrook 7. Anthony Davis 8. Damian Lillard 9. Chris Paul 10. Paul George
Damian Lillard and Draymond Green is a reasonable facsimile of Curry/Green
"Then Damian Lillard what? Post the the rest of the text, please."
"I’m not sure how much I have to repeat this, this isn’t so much above their stats or who is better. You’re ok to choose who you think is better. It’s just one a stats and also to point out that for the last few playoffs Paul George has been memed to death with the Pandemic P. Remember his game 7 vs Denver. Well Damian Lillard got a pass for an even worse performance. Obviously because his team won nobody remembers but I’m pointing out that this stigma or narrative that people run with based on who is the more likeable or who has flashier highlights or this perceived notion that since Dames team wasn’t expected to win we should just forgive his shortcomings when we made fun of Paul George for struggling despite surgery on both of his shoulders.   And as for the teams that Paul George went up against in the East. He went up against a 66-16 Miami Heat at the peak of their powers. He went up against a 2017 Cavaliers team that would probably be champions in most years if not for the Warriors and gave them the best fight out of everyone in the East that year while putting up 28PPG for the series."
"I mean there’s tons of evidence a google away, like [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.nba.com/amp/news/stat-just-happened-damian-lillard-has-taken-dame-time-to-another-stratosphere/qsbaren5il201qs1dqk70ieqg) one"
then damian lillard what?
Trail Blazers just because I don't want to repeat teams that others have said  Damian Lillard  Bill Walton  Clyde Drexler  Scottie Pippen  LaMarcus Aldridge  Definitely could give a lot of teams a run for their money
1. Stephen Curry  2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Trae Young 5. Chris Paul 6. Ja Morant 7. Jrue Holiday 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Ben Simmons 10. Russell Westbrook  That's their top 10
"In 2015, Damian Lillard was a two-time All-Star who averaged 21 points per game. I don't know how they could miss him, even back then."
"The fact people think Damian Lillard is a top 10 player is ridiculous when he has only played 3 great playoff series in his career (2014 first round, 2019 first round, 2021 first round).  Even Russell Westbrook and Paul George are better playoff performers for their careers.  Dame is borderline top 15 tbh and guys like Jayson Tatum and Trae Young have already proved more in the playoffs at this point in their careers."
I think there’s a debate between him and Luka but Trae Young isn’t better than Damian Lillard
"I think it’s up to the fan, if you can separate “the art from the artist” you should. Your favourite player is your favourite player. Time to find a new favourite current player though, there’s lots of exciting talent in the league and maybe you’ll find someone who you like more than Chauncey. Then you won’t even have this question. He’s coaching the Blazers and Damian Lillard would be an excellent candidate for your next favourite player."
"Damian Lillard saying that what he as a professional basketball deals with isn't pressure. Pressure is the homeless dude not knowing where his meal is coming from or the single mother trying to provide for her kids. One of the realest interview quotes ever. I paraphrased it but my respect for Dame jumped so much when he said that, as high as it already was."
"“Damian Lillard was spotted eating at a restaurant right outside Portland, does that mean he wants out?”"
Damian Lillard was also a recent non Nike team USA member
If Simmons goes to the Warriors then wtf are the Blazers getting for Damian fucking Lillard lol

"First team all likable:  Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Klay Thompson, Giannis, Nikola Jokic"
[Serious] Is it time to be concerned about Damian Lillard
"Their best players are 26, 24 and 23 years old, and all of them will most likely be locked up long term as soon as they're eligible. Why would they trade all of their assets, and lock themselves up for a 3 year championship window?  Jamal Murray was better than Damian Lillard at the same age, while he might not reach Lillard's peak he's definitely on the right track. Trading Murray &amp; MPJ + assets for Lillard right now is the equivalent of trading Klay for Kevin Love back in 2013, that's the type of stuff that could set your franchise back for years if you don't win RIGHT now."
"Yeah but Damian Lillard is a legitimate MVP caliber player in his prime. Murray is coming off a season ending injury and MPJ is only a rising star at this point in his career. Anthony Davis required Lonzo, Ingram, Hart, and effectively 4 draft picks. My point is not that those 2 guys aren't good or valuable in a trade but with the way the trade landscape is these days, I can't see them not wanting extra picks to aid in their rebuild."
"Lebron   KD  Giannis  Steph  Harden  Kawhi  Luka Donic  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum   For 14/15 I could care less  I just think that you’re comment about him needing to be top 5 when healthy to be top 15 is complete bs, if I read it right.  If we’re considering Kyrie a PG and James an SG now I hold heartedly believe Kyrie is probably the best SG in the league (yes over Bradley Beal)  He had an absolutely amazing season this year, 9 in points per game, 11th in PER, and is the 9th player to make the 50/40/90 club, he also was having a good playoff run before he went down, and yes I do think Nets take the chip if Kyrie is healthy.  The Nets are a top heavy team that prides themselves on having 3 players who can go off at any moment and are borderline unstoppable when they do, I’ve seen you say it’s best they trade Kyrie, and no offense, that’s BS too.  There aren’t 15 players in the nba better than Kyrie"
Anthony Davis is not better than Damian Lillard because of one playoff series lmao.
"Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, and Rudy Gobert come to mind."
Anyone who thinks Damian Lillard is a better basketball player than Anthony Davis does not watch playoff basketball

"The most recent take of mine that seems to be the most controversial is I think AD deserves to be in the top 75 over Damian Lillard. Frankly, I don't know why AD is getting so much shit but Damian Lillard is given a pass. If Dwight were to get in the top 75 over anyone it should be over Dame, not AD."
"Low key? Damian Lillard shouldn’t be anywhere near that list and everyone should feel very comfortable saying that.   He’s there because he has a fun nickname and is currently playing, not because his career actually puts him remotely close to one of the 75 guys worth putting it."
"The lakers have openly tampered with AD, Westbrook, Lillard, and now Derozan.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;“Bron asked what I was thinking with my situation, and I told him what I’m telling you: that I just want to be in a position to win it all,” Lillard told Yahoo Sports. “He painted the picture to me that if I were to leave, the situation could look like this. He didn’t tell me to come to L.A., and he didn’t say anything to me that I didn’t already know other than what it could look like. I told him, ‘I know if I were to play with y’all, I know it would work out because of my skill set,’ and who I am and who they are.”   &gt;   &gt;They all addressed their respective first-round losses, and what each team needed to improve its roster. Davis explained his transition to Southern California. Lillard expressed his hesitancy to join any iteration of a super-team.   &gt;   &gt;“I was just saying, I don’t know if this is the route I wanted to go,” Lillard told Yahoo Sports. “And that was pretty much how the conversation went.”   &gt;   &gt;The meeting lasted for an hour and a half. Lillard promised to keep them posted on what he decided to do, but the Lakers were already privately evaluating their options on potentially landing Lillard, sources said.  [https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html)  &gt;About two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook went to LeBron James' home and together they and Anthony Davis had a conversation about the All-Star guard joining James and Davis on the Lakers   &gt;   &gt;James and Davis talked about the two of them changing positions if that was best for the team — James moving from small forward to power forward and Davis from power forward to center.

[https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1177717804952367105](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1177717804952367105)"
"There's no guarantee at all that Damian Lillard ever requests a trade.  But from Morey's perspective, the absolute LAST thing he would ever want to do is trade Simmons for role players before an actual legitimate game changing star like Dame becomes available.   He'd rather stick with the status quo than preemptively make a trade and lose out on the chance to acquire a superstar, even if it's an incredibly small chance."
"&gt; i think the misunderstanding is that he thinks he will be get a top 20 player straight up for Ben. I think the play is going to be using Ben as active salary filler instead of dead weight, and add into it multiple young players/picks to get the guy they want.   Exactly, if/when Damian Lillard asks out, you know Morey is going to throw the farm at them, Simmons, Maxey, Shake, Thybulle, all the first-rounders you have. Maybe not *all* of that, but the point is he will offer whatever it takes."
"Well then if you're aware of what he's trying to do, I don't understand where the criticism comes from?   Seems like you want a resolution to this saga now.   Let me spin that question you asked me onto you, who is outbidding the Sixers in a potential Damian Lillard trade that has the combination of assets, desperation, and is a legitimate championship contender with the acquisition of Dame?"
Scottie Barnes is overrated and will flame out of this league.  Damian Lillard is a better player than Steph Curry because of his intangibles and leadership.
"&gt; how has Damian Lillard basically escaped any kind of blowback by his inclusion on the list?  simple, he hasn't"
"Most Career Games With 9+ 3-Pointers Made,  NBA History  Stephen Curry - 37  James Harden -  9  Damian Lillard - 9  Klay Thompson - 7  JR Smith - 5  Kobe Bryant - 4  So, yes, I'll save you the math: he has more than the next five guys combined (34)."
"I feel like of all the factors discussed, All-NBA can be the best indicator of overall peaks and longevity. How many seasons a player was considered top-5, 10 or 15. And when you look at that, it becomes evident I think that Dwight &gt; Dame and AD.  Player | 1st Team | 2nd Team | 3rd Team | Total :------ | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | -----: Chris Paul | 4 | 5 | 1 | 10 Russell Westbrook | 2 | 5 | 2 | 9 Dwight Howard | 5 | 1 | 2 | 8 Damian Lillard | 1 | 4 | 1 | 6 Anthony Davis | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4  Dwight was the best centre in the league by this account 5 times, and in contention several more seasons. AD was 4 times. But there's nothing else. The rest of it is either injured or underwhelming."
"&gt;This sub loves piling on the Lakers, but why is no one talking about the defending Western Conference Champion Suns being 1-3?  &gt;I didn’t realize until now that the Suns are currently 1-3.. why is no-one talking about this?  &gt;They lost to a mediocre Kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the Trailblazers with a struggling Damian Lillard. And from what I know they’re just about fully healthy.  &gt;For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what’s the main reason for the early season struggles? You would think they’d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing Finals run..  This thread reminds me of this. Incoming 9 game win streak for the Bucks."
"A+, Damian Lillard has been fantastic this season."
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard: .277 ws/48 3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.   I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt; Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.   Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.   As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts per hundred when he checks in, that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.   &gt; Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.   I don't know what your point is here with the whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team. Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.   &gt; And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.   3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.   I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.   Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.   The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.   If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.   [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"

"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"best mid range shooter in the Chinese league, maybe. He cut down on his inefficient 3s but he still wasn't a good shooter.

What if the pistons drafted melo/Dwade  What if Damian Lillard was traded to a contender like 5 years ago.  What if kobe got traded  What if okc kept their big3  What if KD never joined the warriors
"Might just be showing Lillard had the opportunity to join the lakers and didnt, so he wasnt virtue signaling.  &gt;All these fake-ass NBA players coming out and saying they wouldn't join super teams are full of shit.  &gt;Best example is Damian Lillard saying that he wouldn't join a super team in an interview this week  Also still fun to laugh at the whole hardest road thing"

Two reasons:   * Damian Lillard can make so many shots from 35 feet out * Anthony Davis is a guard in a center's body
The Dennis Smith - CJ McCollum - Anfernee Simons - Damian Lillard - Jusuf Nurkic lineup gonna take the league by storm.
so this is damian lillard and the portland trail blazers 4 years in the future after we trade him
"&gt;And some people in 2019 and 2020 discussed Damian Lillard as the best point guard in the NBA over steph curry.  And some people discussed Steph Curry as a better player than MJ during the 73-9 run. Someone, somewhere, making a nonsensical comparison doesn't make every other discussion illogical.  KAT was in that discussion because his offensive package is astounding but his defensive presence is sorely lacking, similar to Jokic. It was only last year that Jokic separated himself offensively from KAT and Embiid. And all that is to say, Jokic is still not a defensive presence."
And some people in 2019 and 2020 discussed Damian Lillard as the best point guard in the NBA over steph curry.    Dosent mean that it is true because it was a somewhat common take that people had.    Yeah some people tried to argue KAT as the best center in the league but the argument was weak

"Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, and James Harden all see his potential. If you watch, you can see the talent he just needs a lot of fine-tuning with ball security and shooting."
"Shit yeah, maybe we can tank for 5 years and maybe get someone as good as Damian Lillard"
"&gt; There’s a reason Klay was the one guarding James Harden,Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving during those warriors playoff runs  The question is about the Regular Season.   Likewise there can be other reasons why Klay guards opposing PGs - to conserve Steph's energy on offense, to prevent Steph from getting into foul trouble, etc.   Same reason Battier sometimes guarded the best opposing wing over LeBron."
"Steph is okay on defense but he’s allowed to roam way more since he’s always on the weakest offensive guard. There’s a reason Klay was the one guarding James Harden,Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving during those warriors playoff runs"
"&gt;I don't know if he's hurt or not  ""Blazers announce Damian Lillard will be out for Sunday's game at Denver because of his abdomen.""  https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1459652225731637248?"
"Exactly, on/off and advanced stats are not good at evaluating defense so the numbers OP posted should be taken with a grain of salt.   Jokic also had the worst rim protection numbers of any starting centre in the league last season. Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, CP3 had historically great playoff series attacking Jokic. Nuggets actively tanked one season to avoid the Harden/Jokic matchup in the playoffs."

"Damian Lillard is becoming the most overrated player ever. He can be sensational at times, and I think that leads to seeing him as higher all-time than his overall output warrants."
"Who the better player is isn't determined by who gets more double teams lol  Damian Lillard gets doubled way more than LeBron James, does that make him a better player?"
The idea that 2011 Derrick Rose was as good as the Damian Lillard of the last season or two is comical. One of the most overrated players of all time.
"Dwight been good for 10 years. Dwight in these 10 years managed to carry an orlando magic team to the finals.  Got 8 allstar appearances, 5 all nba first team selections, 1 second and 2 third.  3 times named defensive player of the year and 4 times all defensive first team, 1 time all defensive second.  Lead the league in rebounds 5 times and in blocks 2 times, won a dunk contest and got an olympic gold medal.  If damian lillard with ZERO achievements and accomplishments is in there, if street clothes is in there , there is absolutely NO reason Dwight shouldn't be. Being goofy or after your 11th season starting to decline because a franchise and its base basically pushed you to ruin your body shouldnt disqualify you from this."
Don't forget when he won the game guarding Damian Lillard. Dude is winning games in the clutch guarding some of the best players in the game.
"Okay let's see(in no particular order):  1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Curry 4. Giannis 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Harden 10. Doncic 11. AD 13. Butler 14. Donovan Mitchell 15. Trae Young 16. Chris Paul 17. D Booker 18. Jason Tatum 19. Damian Lillard  I guess I'd have him at 20, because everyone else I think of is either a bit young and unproven(Morant) or debatable(Bradley Beal)."
Top 3 point guard? LOL get out of here. I can list a couple that are DEFINITELY and NO DOUBT better than Trae:  James Harden Chris Paul Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Kyle Lowry    Now which 4 are you kicking out to put Trae as top 3? LOL
Brain dead idea lol. Damian Lillard has never won an MVP and he was unquestionably better than Rose.
Lonzo Ball &gt; Damian Lillard   As a rapper
"Was trying to name 20 point guards or ""combo"" guards better than him all time. Could only get to 18.      Stephen Curry   Chris Paul   John Stockton   Jason Kidd   Steve Nash   Allen Iverson   Dwyane Wade   Isiah Thomas   Magic Johnson   Russell Westbrook   James Harden   Damian Lillard   Gary Payton   Jerry West   Oscar Robertson   Walt Frazier   Bob Cousy   Nate Archibald"
At this point I’m confident in saying that Jrue Holiday is a better defender than Damian Lillard.
"I totally get why people have a problem with it for sure. I think another part of it for him was that it was his eighth season there and might’ve just needed a change of scenery after being that close and still coming up short. He’d been in the league close to a decade at that point and I bet by then he just wanted to give himself the best chance at ensuring he wouldn’t retire without a championship. The move from Oklahoma to California was probably a factor too.  I guess I’ve never had a problem with it because I think if I’m him in the same position with an opportunity to join that team, I’d do the same thing.  I think fans tend to look at it like a soft move, but for him I bet the decision was pretty easy. Of course he’d want to join Steph Curry on a team that just went 73-9.  In rare cases you’ll have guys like Damian Lillard who find a sense of pride in team loyalty, which I think is great, I just don’t think that’s the norm. I think most players in Durant’s shoes given the opportunity would’ve made the same choice. Impossible to know of course, but for him it seems like the move made a ton of sense and it obviously worked out for him."

"And in fact that's probably another positive in dealing with Ben. ""See look how highly we rate him. We won't trade him for anything less than Damian Lillard, because that's his level, alright."""
It is absurd to me that people tend to forget that not long ago they were asking for nothing less than Damian Lillard. There is no way you get rid of Simmons unless you understand that at this point he is a negative asset. Not because he is that bad of a player but because with the way he is acting he is not worth the risk
"Cut him some slack, he’s Damian Lillard- with a Pacers flair. He’s just confused."
"Hey, new Blazers FO guys, we'll take one Damian Lillard please"

Plus, you only have 6 downvotes and one comment explaining why you were wrong. That's hardly ""torn apart"".  Also, you can't possibly be a Blazer fan and think that 20 years later (and after nine years of Damian Lillard) anyone is still thinking the Jailblazers era has any bearing whatsoever on what's going on now.

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

"“They know they don't have the pieces to give Daryl Morey that are immediately going to help him win a championship. The hope is that maybe if Daryl Morey gets pressed into a corner, maybe he would take a draft pick heavy package from the Wolves and then use some of those picks later on down the line to go get a Damian Lillard or a Bradley Beal.”"
This whole situation makes no sense at all. From the reason they ran with I believe in the Athletic to the adjustments being made by the organization.  If Damian Lillard is really on the block I don’t see why you can do a three team trade for Kyrie to Portland Simmons to Brooklyn and Lillard to Philly.. maybe other players and pics as well
"Honestly I don’t think Ben can be blamed to an extent for wanting out, this isn’t really like a normal situation   He got thrown under the bus by a teammate who can’t stay healthy for good playoff runs who has his own problems and his own damn coach   The coach comments in particular with both the trump supporter thing and the original things were wildly unprofessional and not something that should be said to the media   Imo it would either have to be a Simmons goes or the coach goes almost immediately once those comments are made   You can make fun of Simmons and his play and be right to criticize him and his lack of improvement on offense but I don’t think you can really blame him  for wanting out when he was thrown under the bus the way he was, why should he want to play for a coach that disrespected him so blatantly like that? And honestly embiid didn’t help much either.   It’s not really his problem if they tried to trade him but tried to ask for Damian lillard and more on top of it or some wild shit when literally your own coach put him on blast for not being able to win with him lol"
Philly fans really convinced themselves that Ben’s value has dropped so low the best they can get is Damian Lillard…
It’s reasonable the clippers get Damian Lillard?  It’s 7:30 am and I have to read this to start my day? I’m going back to bed.

"I remember being at work when this game happened. The thunder were up big I think near the end of the third so I stopped checking the score and had a big smile my whole shift. Then came my dickhead manager with a shit eating grin on his face telling me Damian Lillard just made a game winning 3. I was like first of all Mark, you should be helping us down here not watching the game, and second of all let me see the score cause I don’t believe you. He showed me and my mood did an instant 180. I avoided watching this clip for months and every time I saw Dames damn face all serious on the thumbnail I aggressively scrolled past it. It hurt me in a way I didn’t think anything could hurt me again after Curry’s shot on game 6 2016. Damn all these shooty shooty point guards. WHY must they hurt our inverse shooty point guard like this? When my kids are acting up one day, I’ll tell them there’s a dagger 3 hiding in the closet. If they don’t shit themselves I know I will."

The purpose of the shot isn't for it to go in at a good rate, the purpose of it is to expand his range and shift defenses and hit a few.  Like I said, very few of those are side step shots with a hand in his face. They're off screens, they're in transition, they're late shot clock. If he took that same shot against the thunder a hundred times it's not going to go in 40% of the time, like it's an incredibly difficult shot that he already shoots below the typical average 3pt shot (36/37%) He doesn't hit them with good efficiency, it just helps the overall offense and his game"

"That thumbnail pretty much encapsulates the kind of player Damian Lillard is. If there was ever a top NBA photos ever list, this would be up there. I mean, it's just too fucking cool."
Steph being a bystander to the Jordan Poole and Damian Lillard duel pretty much sums up the pre-season so far
very common. These guys practice shooting 3s with a hand in their face after 2 hours of cardio. Shooting open set 3s in warmup is like free throws for most elite shooters. Damian Lillard can easily shoot 10 in a row 10ft behind the 3pt line

"Still kind of surprising since they were drafted 4 years apart, but Mitchell just turned 25 while Giannis turns 27 in early December, so it's much closer to a full 2 years older than it is to 1 year older.   Damian Lillard being 3 years older than guys like Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal is something I find myself forgetting since they were all in the same draft class (Lillard was a 4-year college player while Davis and Beal were both one-and-done)."
"all the passes he gets are totally fair and justified though. its not like aaron rodgers where every year he underperforms and people make the same claims of how the front office cant get him help, he was in contention for the chip every year till he got hurt and his team showed without him and klay they are literally the worst team in the league and then he comes back and turns them into a borderline playoff team instantly. like i dont think its fair to call him overrated because of the past couple years. as i was making this reply i came up with a dark horse overrated player: damian lillard. every year he comes up short, and people make excuses about his team so as a consequence he is still seen as one of those top superstar players. i guess it really depends where you rank him but i think most people put him in the tier just below the lebron tier and with 1 conference finals appearance with where he is at in his career idk if thats really justified"

"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer’s newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons’ availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly — and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season’s $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons’ absence: It’s ‘borderline kind of disrespectful’  The Sixers’ position that they’re not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They’re trying to win a championship, and believe they’re in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who’s in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren’t as blindsided by Simmons’ desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons’ trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons’ camp don’t believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they’re just determined to do it on their terms.

Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta.YONG KIM / Staff Photographer Destined for a messy divorce  Publicly, the Sixers talk about wanting Simmons to return and be part of a championship team in Philly. The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has “run its course.”  “They know that,” a source said. “They’ve been known that. It doesn’t matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He’s going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.” Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can’t blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can’t blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  “But that doesn’t negate that the relationship is done,” another source said. “This is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That’s what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it’s not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.”  » READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers’ starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers’ tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons’ skills was more lovely, it’s hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers’ lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly’s steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn’t honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  “This entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,” a source said. “It’s not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It’s not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. …. It’s never been smooth at all.”  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player’s former team got worse. That’s something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid’s squad, not Simmons’ team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team’s go-to player.  “What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. “I’m just [speaking] facts. But because he’s Australian, because he’s a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.”"
"Not sure, but I think it's possible. At the very least he is not really interested in raising it. Some people say things like ""he should come back and play better so he rehabilitates his value"", and I don't see any incentive for him to do that. Unless he does something crazy, his value will remain high enough that there'll be plenty of suitors regardless. He doesn't care if those suitors offer damian lillard or two 2nd round picks. If anything, it's better for him cause he goes to a better team, like you said."
Lol this sub is fucking delusional. This is boning the shit outta the sixers. They can tell themselves whatever they want but this is absolutely not a “good for them” situation with the team. If they claim they tried to look for trades in good faith effort by shooting for only Damian fucking lillard and then being like “oh welp we couldn’t trade you Ben sorrryyyy”
"&gt; We’re all just bugs in Jeff Bezos’ terrarium  His wealth compared to even people with like hundreds of millions of dollars is just absurd.  Lillard has made $150M over his career so far from his contracts. Obviously, you need to take tax out, but he's also made a ton from endorsements. Let's assume he didn't throw away too much money and his net worth is $200M.  Let's compare Bezos' net worth to Lillard's compared to a normal retiree worth $1M, a large amount, but something actually attainable for normal people with a good job saving like $500-$1000 per month.  $5 to someone worth $1M is pretty much nothing. You'd spend more than that on a random lunch. It would be 0.0005% of your net worth. That's the same as $1k to Damian Lillard. That's a much more significant amount, but still not a ton. It could help with some bills, maybe rent for a month depending on where you are, but it definitely isn't life changing. With Jeff Bezos, 0.0005% of his net worth is $1M. That's just absurd. He could literally lose millions of dollars and not be impacted whatsoever."
Good.  Morrey is being an ass not trading him already.   Each day gone is another day of his value getting lower and lower.  Simmons trade value was higher a week ago than it is now yet this idiot still thinks he’ll get a Damian Lillard for Ben at this point.
"There’s no reason to be scared at this point. That’s not a valid excuse. Lebron, Damian lillard, Steph curry, Anthony Davis all took the vaccine. 184 million people have taken the vaccine so far. Any sensible Doctor will recommend them taking the vaccine. I’m worried that they are sending a bad message to young fans and influencing people into not taking the vaccine. Testing does nothing to help with reaching herd immunity and finally getting past this pandemic. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. If they don’t want to take a vaccine they just can’t be employed by the nba. Which is a private business protecting their old coaches and staff. They got through a whole season but there were some many precautions taken and players still got COVID about 63 players last year got Covid in the league. So I don’t know where you’re getting information that they were “fine”  Listen you thinking that reading fake information online from Twitter or Facebook makes you know more than an actually health professionals is just ridiculous."

"Battle between Pacific and Northwest. For the Northwest division I'd do:   Damian Lillard, Anthony Edwards, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Joe Ingles, and Nikola Jokic."
"All-time: Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Shaquille O'Neal  Current: Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic"
Straight up for Damian Lillard.
"Even if Ben had positive trade value it would still be an uphill battle because it requires dame wanting out. The way Philly is framing this trade is so weird because just from reading the headlines you’d think that ben is the superior player and they’re angling to get a haul for him, when in reality he’d need to be the centerpiece of a huge package because they’re asking for fucking damian lillard"
there was nothing on tv while i was home (basketball is on around midday in Australia) so I just started watching it and Damian lillard had 60 points so I started supporting the blazers.
"Klay Thompson and Damian Lillard were picked immediately after Fredette and Robinson too... Kings could've been in contention with a lineup of Dame, Klay, Gay, Williams, Cousins.  Or they could have got Klay and Kawhi and had Tyreke, Klay, Kawhi, Rudy, Boogie."
"Always wondered why more people dont see this. Cant imagine Dame having any ideas about 'hey maybe i ought to go to Philly'.. got to be 10 teams at least he would be more interested in going to. Philly other than some idea about getting a championship with a solid player like Embid, just doesn't make any sense regarding Mr Damian Lillard."
"and the blazers wouldn't do that. RoCo has been the most important blazer not named damian lillard since he joined the team, not to mention their front office holds all the cards not philly"
"Damian Lillard stayed 4 years in college and turned out fine, all depends on the guy."
Damian Lillard would have been Nik Stauskas and Kawhi Leonard would have been Stanley Johnson if they went to the King
"[A refresher] (https://www.blazersedge.com/2021/7/29/22600696/damian-lillard-henry-abbott-twitter-beef-portland-trail-blazers-trade-demand)  Do you really think a reporter who tweets like that is a victim? He dug himself in on a bad story and THAT’S why he became Ab🤖  Holding water for this dude is just so weird, especially when you admit you don’t remember the whole situation clearly"
You really think other teams wouldn't outbid that? You can't even find anyone willing to part with a McCollum level player for Simmons. Adding Maxey and Thybulle isn't going to get you Damian Lillard.
He's shot better from three than Damian Lillard 5 straight years with a difference of less than one attempt per game
I still laugh at the thought that Philly fans thought the team was gonna get Damian Lillard for Ben Simmons. Philly is gonna get from Simmons whatever Sacramento wants to offer.
"And that's why he's worth Damian Lillard, right?"
Damian Lillard a real one.
"In order to have any argument for someone being ""obviously"" better scorer to someone else, you shouldn't have close to same TS, let along the other person having slightly more. Obviously better scorer would be like comparing Damian Lillard to Jrue Holiday."

"[I looked it up because I thought I was too.](https://people.com/sports/blazers-star-damian-lillard-lost-6-family-members-18-months/)  Dame lost 6 family members over the course of covid stuff, but it wasn't all covid.  Found his cousin/chef dead in his home May of last year (he walked in on the body and was just standing over it in shock), had an aunt die of cancer, family friend died of covid, two cousins got shot."
yeah... because they have Damian Lillard lol
I'd love to see Damian Lillard do that with his teammates!

"The Los Angeles Lakers may have landed Russell Westbrook this offseason, but he wasn't their first choice.  Bill Oram, Shams Charania and Sam Amick of The Athletic reported the Lakers initially wanted to target Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard to team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. When it became clear they weren't going to get either Beal or Lillard, the team shifted its focus to ""more realistic"" targets.  No shit"
"Excerpt:   &gt; In the two months that followed their first-round playoff flop against Phoenix, when Davis’ groin injury left them pulling up lame, the Lakers explored the prospect of trading for such stars as Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook. The process unfolded well beyond the team’s front office’s search, with James setting up a war room of his own at his Brentwood estate for some in-person player meetings while leading remote communications in other conversations."
"It would probably be smarter to use ""Simmons"" as the audible for a deep throw. I don't know if anyone on defense got it, but I feel like there's a chance of picking up on ""Damian Lillard"" being a deep bomb."
"That would be very confusing for him to call out Dame Time in this situation, Damian Lillard (DL) is a deep left route.   Dame Time (DT) is actually quite a bit different, and is the primary audible Carr uses in the hotel room with his mistress. Meaning deep throat."
"I don't understand why philly fans are expecting much in exchange. All they talk about is how awful he is, but theres some cognitive dissonance happening here because they seem to think although they believe he's awful he's somehow still worth a Damian Lillard level player in exchange 🤣🤣"
Damian Lillard = Deep Left
"Yeah, his name is Damian Lillard."
To be fair I love Norm. He’s been my favorite pickup in the Damian Lillard era
"Luka has been 1 and done in the playoffs though. If 1 playoff series is enough, Donovan Mitchell last year looked like a god and Damian Lillard is the best player in the NBA this series. Trae Young has better TS than Luka if you average out the three years Luka only was more efficient his rookie year than Trae."
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."
tl;dr:   1. Giannis is as loveable and amazing as you think he is and even more.  2. Some of the quotes that you see from this interview are clickbaity in the sense that the meaning of what he is saying is significantly different when taken out of context.   3. He is hungry for more.  4. He is a big fan of Damian Lillard (see what I mean with no.2?).
Yeah but you’re not gonna trade Damian lillard for a guy who can’t take constructive criticism.
"2x ABA champions, bear in mind the ABA wasn't just some G league, and included top talent in the 70s right up until the merger. Moses Malone, Dr J, Artis Gilmore and countless others. Also, why would championships matter in a discussion like this, were u even alive in the 90s? Omg, were you on the Houston rockets, my bad g, as an ex pro you know soooo much more about leadership than I do.  Either way, this isn't a discussion about franchises, or you resting on some 25 year old laurels. This is about Chamberlain's leadership and his character. An example of a guy taking responsibility for team failures would be Damian Lillard, countless all time playoff performances,  this year he was totally let down by a disastrous team OT performance, still stays loyal to Portland and  accepted the fault that he had in that loss, however little that fault was. That's leadership, Chamberlain wasn't that. Just read Kareem's open letter to him, he was a whiny little bitch who was so insecure in his own legacy that he would constantly tear down other players, MJ included. His fanbase is one of the most cultish and deluded I have ever seen, matched only by Kobe Bryant stans."
"Watch those 4th quarters and tell me that's a top 20 player who's worth max money and good enough to be the centerpiece of a James Harden or Damian Lillard trade and I'd laugh in your face.   Those were the expectations for him, because that's how highly we all thought of him and he failed miserably."
"NBA News, September 26  Ben Simmons' feelings still hurt, Doc Rivers attempts to soothe situation by saying the only certainty on the 76ers roster is that he is a championship coach  NBA News, September 27  Hearing rumblings that Ben Simmons attempted a 3pter in practice, and indications from multiple sources are that went in, after hitting the backboard  NBA News, September 28  It is rumoured that the Sixers might be possibly considering redoubling efforts to trade Ben Simmons for Damian Lillard  NBA News, September 29  No new news the Blazers front, but Blazer fans on the internet have indicated they would likely accept such a deal if Daryl Morey was also part of the package to Portland"
"NBA News, September 28  It is rumoured that the Sixers are redoubling efforts to trade Ben Simmons for Damian Lillard  NBA News, September 29  According to sources, the Blazers are still not interested but Blazer fans would consider the deal if Daryl Morey was also part of the package"
"Well that’s just nonsensical. There’s only one Anthony Davis and one Damian Lillard that existed in the 2021 NBA season, and Lillard was the better player.  And my point here is is that it’s silly to use Davis vs. Lillard as an example that there is more to how good a player is than PPG when Davis and Lillard have very similar PPG numbers minus this injury riddled season for Davis."
"Its not just ""get this guy a PG"", they need the right team mate. Ben Simmons who can be a shooting option is the best player for their team. But unfortunately, he has not developed that part of his game.  There is no other player in the league who is as good a passer and defender as Ben Simmons. The problem for Ben is that he isnt a shooting threat, if he could be an option like Draymond Green then he would change the whole dynamic of their offence. You cant bring in someone like Damian Lillard and expect the team to be the same  because dame is not the player they need. Someone like Rondo would be perfect but hes on the lakers now."
"Yeah I get what you’re saying and don’t disagree. You obviously aren’t able to grasp what I’m trying to get across here but whatever. Let’s not have a nuanced conversation I guess. Lebron is perfect and always has been, there’s no reason to to look closely at his game.   3pt% definitely tells you everything you need to know about a shooter. Damian Lillard, one of the top 5 greatest shooters to ever exist, has a .375 career 3pt%."
Lillard is now tied with Steph Curry with the most points scored in an Overtime period.Steph Curry scored 17 points in 1 OT ... against Damian Lillard's Blazers back in 2016
"Dudes like Damian Lillard, Steph, Russel Westbrook, etc, deserve that praise. They don't run away or turn their back on their teams."
"&gt;Damian Lillard is averaging 36 points and 10 assists with just 1.7 TOs on 67.4% TS%.  It should be clear this is referring to the playoffs, why would this be referring to the regular season?  And if top players score more than 20 PPG increase the cutoff number next time, first person to bring it up."
"CJ is like a brother to me, he's the father to my 2 children, BUT in the 4th quarter, with the game on the line, NOBODY, I MEAN NOBODY else on this team other than Damian Lillard should be allowed to touch the ball. CJ and other dogs should have been locked in a closet in the parking lot until the game is over."
"There’s been plenty of talk about firing Stotts or trading CJ, but I think win or lose going forward, it’s time to move on from Neil Olshey.  Start there, find a GM who has a plan to get another all star level player on this team and go from there.  The parts of this team not named Damian Lillard are all replaceable pieces, but Dame’s window is closing fast and running it back just isn’t an option."
"Rumor has it they wanted Thomas Robinson lol. He was drafted at 5 so he wouldn't have been there, but Billy King taking Robinson over Damian Lillard would be a beautiful bow to wrap up his tenure as the Nets GM."
"&gt;Damian Lillard after scoring 55 and 2 buzzer beaters to send the game to OT after his team has sucked throughout the game: ""I still believe we can win in Portland""   and the Nuggets are not even at full strength.. Missing their main perimeter scorer and ball handler"
He told KD that he had like 4 tweets he wanted to write to describe this masterpiece by Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr.

"Nah, I'm pretty sure he's named Damian Fuck-Russell-Westbrook Lillard, Jr."
"No, he's Damian Houston Lillard Jr"
Imagine Damian Lillard with good teammates. Unstoppable
"Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr. &gt; Michael Jordan. I don’t care, fuck it. This is unreal. Nothing is real. HOLY SHIT."
Damian Lillard is clearly the story of the game and deservedly so - an all-time playoff performance. But very few ITT are also acknowledging how fantastic the Nuggets played.
Damian Lillard is the best Blazer of all time. Man is elite as fuck
"How does the NBA reconcile or defend the difference in officiating between guards outside the arc pulling up for 3s and what goes facing up or back to the basket within the arc   &amp;#x200B;  OR  &amp;#x200B;  The difference between damian lillard getting this call pulling up for 3 but larger forwards not getting calls when getting hacked or bumped on the way to the basket?  &amp;#x200B;  It's getting infuriating at this point.  &amp;#x200B;  Just look at the difference between what defenders could do to Jokic on his post ups or face-ups - BTW, I totally agree they should be able to do this. It's the playoffs. - but they were forearming shimmying him, bumping him, hacking him, and he wasn't getting those calls.  &amp;#x200B;  Then they call this garbage.  &amp;#x200B;  There was a play in OT Blazers down 5 or 8 or something, and Lillard crosses Rivers up and gets a tiny little sliver of contact and they get the and 1 call. Then next play Jokic posts up and gets two hard forearms in the back from Melo or Covington then Melo clearly bumps him off his spot while shooting on the move and no call.  &amp;#x200B;  Again, I don't think that Melo play should be a foul at all. This is the god damn playoffs, man. But if you aren't calling that then little guards pulling up for 40 foot 3s don't deserve ticky tack calls either."
"Hmm, I guess that must mean that Damian Lillard played quite well, while the Los Angeles Lakers did not play quite as well"

"People will talk about other players missing crucial shots this game, but won’t talk about them having to take those shots off-rhythm because they had to stand around and watch the Damian Lillard Show for the last 5 mins.  He’s basically icing out his teammates with hero ball until he gets tired, then he defers to his teammates who can’t make the shot because now they’re cold which leads to Dame getting all the love, while his teammates get all the hate."
Clutchness and shooting ability aren't the same. Advanced metrics and eye test love Dame. Think of how many game winning playoff shots and game tying playoff shots Dame has to Steph. I mean 0 disrespect to Steph but Dame is one of the most clutch players all time. Just google most clutch player you're going to get way more Dame than Steph. Now can we please stop comparing the two and enjoy them both for what they do!  https://bolavip.com/en/nba/damian-lillard-and-the-5-most-clutch-players-in-nba-history-20210215-0006.html  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2940661-ranking-nbas-most-clutch-players-this-season

Damian Lillard + 1-4 flat = clutch buckets
"&gt;That’s false, he had one good series against the Celtics in 2017.  19-12-2 2016 First Round  19-13-3 2016 ECSF  15-6-3 on 64% TS 2016 ECF  16-10-2 2017 First Round  23-12-3 2017 ECF  21-12-2 2018 ECSF  &gt;I also find it funny how you feel it’s okay to exclude the good defenses love went up against to somehow make a point? There’s no excuse for being consistently useless on the offense end if you’re some superstar player, regardless of who you’re up against.  It's as if you don't understand how much of an outlier those Warriors teams were on both ends of the floor. If those Warriors teams can heavily slow down the likes of Damian Lillard and James Harden, I don't see how you can fault Love heavily for not being able to defend or score well against the arguable GOAT team in history. That's the only team I'm putting a caveat on, not ""every good defense Love played against"". Those Warriors are just an anomaly in how good they were.  &gt; score inside at a better rate  But their difference in rTS% was around 1-2%. An alright difference, but not really a huge chasm.  &gt;bosh is better than love  Agreed. But that doesn't mean Love wasn't an All NBA level talent when he joined Cleveland.  &gt;Regardless, if you’re calling the heat a superteam it has less to do with bosh and more to do with wade.  That definitely wasn't the narrative back then. The Heat were considered a superteam because they had 3 All NBA level talents on the floor. Wade and LeBron wouldn't have been considered a superteam, just a high level duo.   &gt; Kyrie was a rising star when LeBron returned.  This is fair. But Kyrie was a borderline All NBA caliber talent during his pre-Bron Cleveland stint. He was a 22-6-4 guys in the 2 seasons prior to LeBron's return and didn't get the awards because of his shitty team, not because his individual talent wasn't good enough.  &gt;So if you ask me, the heat weren’t a superteam  Then this is where we end our discussion, since we have different barometers on what a superteam is. The Heat by nearly every account was considered as a superteam when they teamed up. Dirk's biggest boost to his legacy was beating the ""superteam Heat"". Both former and current players have called those Heat teams a superteam."
Last night when he was Damian Lillard
"i don't understand how this is even controversial  if defense was anywhere near as valuable as offense, paul george vs damian lillard would still be a debate (hint: it's not)  not to mention richardson isn't even lockup like *that*"
He's better than just about everyone except Damian Lillard.
"Luka ""Damian Lillard"" Doncic with no help"
Damian Lillard energy
"This was the best regular season Damian Lillard has ever had. Steph Curry still had a better regular season this year in everyones opinion except for Portland fans while playing for a team that has the worst record in the league without him. Still not even close, mate."

"Damian Lillard. Degree of difficulty on his triples is insane, I think only Steph throws up more ridiculous threes and hits them as consistently.  I’d like to shoutout Zach LaVine though. He’s not on that leaderboard, but he did shoot 40+% from deep on a fuckton of attempts per game, has a 13 three game to his name, and regularly creates for himself on the perimeter. He’s elite elite but the lack of regular season success for the Bulls clouds people’s judgment of him imo."

Here's some proof for you. I'm guessing you'll just say the journalist who wrote this is wrong too?  https://nz.news.yahoo.com/news/nba-playoffs-nuggets-blazers-foul-call-damian-lillard-austin-rivers-double-overtime-042358900.html
It was super fucked. If damian lillard made the shot I guarantee you they wouldn't have had to balls to call the foul on the floor and take away the shot. Dame basically got 2 tries to make the final shot in regulation. It was utter shit. And it got glossed over because he went nuclear in OT.
but Damian Lillard is Damian Lillard
"It's fun to sit back and watch people argue Curry vs anyone who isn't Damian Lillard. Dame gets discredited for the same shit people excuse Curry for. I'm not making a dame&gt;curry statement, just an observation. Seeing shit like ""But he didn't have KD"" around here lmao you guys are great."
"I wouldn't use this to hate on Steph, he's an all-time great player and the GOAT shooter regardless imo.  *But* I would use this to defend guys like Dame who are criticized for not moving off-ball like Steph. It is easier to rely on off-ball movement when you play with an elite playmaker like Draymond Green, something a guy like Damian Lillard has never benefited from."
"Meanwhile Damian Lillard busts his ass to try and keep his team from losing. Fails, but fails honorably."
"Damian Lillard did everything he could to keep his team in the game.  &amp;#x200B;  Meanwhile LeBron, the self proclaimed GOAT (in his own deluded mind) did...nm"
"it also reminded me of when the trail blazers decided to play drop coverage on steph in game 1 of the 2019 WCF. i was watching the game and yelling for them to double dame. i’d much rather have robert covington or norman powell shooting a wide open shot than damian lillard getting an iso when he’s hot, and that’s just how good damian lillard is"
"For real. I remember this one time I was expecting my team to have a respectable record, but then they only ended up winning 7 games and clinching the worst record in NBA history. But in my head, I was thinking well at least we got the 2nd pick in the draft! Turns out that instead of drafting Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, or even Harrison Barnes, we ended up drafting a guy whose shooting form looks like a pretzel.    Oh wait that's not my team..."
"I totally get your enthusiasm, what Dame did this game is something I've never quite seen on a playoff game. Clutch Dame can be an absolute monster. But when we compare players we have to take more into account than just one playoff game. This was the best regular season in Dame's career and Steph was still better in most people's opinion. And Steph's been doing it for 7+ years. Obviously I'm biased here but I think most NBA fans would agree with me.  Damian Lillard is my second favorite player btw, even though he doesn't play for my team."
"Give Damian Lillard Draymond, Klay, KD etc and he’ll “show up” smh  Steph without his supporting cast was a 9th seed this year"
can we call him Damian or Lillard? Whenever someone says Dame in written language I think of the song “Baka Mitai” instead

That's just not true.  If the Blazers would actually be willing to trade Damian Lillard but it would require both Simmons and Maxey along with some first round picks then you make that deal.

"Way too soon to think about the guys on that list…   Is Damian Lillard a superstar (probably)? That’s his absolute ceiling, IMO. Not seeing enough offensive versatility to make up for for his size and defensive deficits. Without adding more to his arsenal he could be a borderline top 5-10 player some years but never in serious consideration for best player in the league"

Play him with Damian lillard
"This super long, sorry but I had a lot of feelings. I had so much joy watching Tyrese light it up in the first half while Ben sat on the bench.    Earlier this season when he dropped 39 points against the Nuggets, I posted this: Tyrese Maxey isn't an unearthed precious mineral recovered from the depths of the earth, needing hours and hours of intense labor and hundreds of degree of heat to take form and value. He is a cracked-screen industry-setting next generation phone released 5 years early, akin to an iPhone 6 in 2011. The shards have their bite and it's uncomfortable to use but the daybreak of a new era is only a tempered sheet of glass away. That screen, that window or barrier to the greatest works of humanities brightest minds is a corrected hip sway. It throws his jumper off and leads to inefficient numbers. Once that's resolved, defenses will respect him as a shooter and passing lanes will open up for him in a new way.     This season has proven it's Joel's team, and I think if they don't win a chip this season, it's going to come down to what Joel wants. Tyrese is cheap and he **is** better than Ben but will he be a championship caliber point guard in his second year that can find Joel and Seth in their spots, shoot to keep defenses honest and not lose his cool when the defense focuses on him?    Obvious he's incredible but if the Sixers want someone like Damian Lillard, they'll probably have to trade him to make it work. But I still believe that if Morey attaches enough picks to Ben, the Sixers can get someone decent in return, like CJ McCollum who can be an explosive scorer but isn't a great defender and has injury concerns.    But it comes down to Joel because this is all on his timeline. Does he want to take the risk of having an immature/not-ready PG next year while he's trying to go for a championship or does he want to risk cratering the cap and missing out on playing with a guy who could fulfill all their needs next year. It's a thinker    My goodness! Tyrese! He's been incredible but he used up all of my surprise when I watched him play for Kentucky :)"

This is the same argument people use when detracting Damian Lillard. The West was *stacked* when AD was playing.
"Bro, I glanced and saw ""Wizards star Bradley Beal,"" and underneat ""Portland's Damian Lillard,"" and got anxiety."
"You would never- I repeat NEVER- get Damian Lillard for only one of those two players, as each player currently stands.  It doesn't matter what picks you offer, and it doesn't matter what other roster piece you offer.  This could obviously change as year(s) pass and the level of each player changes.   As it stands, Portland rolls their eyes as they politely decline."
"I don't think that's remotely delusional, plus it wouldn't even make sense financially to swap two for one when MPJ is about to get a max extension.  The Nuggets have a very ""young"" timeline.  Their oldest core player is Jokic at 26.  Lillard is 30.  They wouldn't give up both Murray and MPJ for a 31 year old Lillard.  That's not delusional, no NBA team would do that.    They would try to work a deal like Murray + Monte + several draft picks for Damian or something like that.  If it didn't work, they'd keep riding with this team that has continually finished as a top 3 seed in the West and is already considered a title contender for the next few years.  This is just basic logic, dude"
"Once the bulls get Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson, and Lonzo Ball this offseason, LaVine will easily"
"My eyes just went to ""Beal joins Portland's Damian Lillard..."""

Both halves are not played the same. You don't foul guys on purpose to get extra possessions at the end of the second quarter and Damian Lillard isn't going into Dame time to close the first half. Obviously the points still count but the second half of NBA games (really any sport) is played differently than the first half and is more important.
"Lol a great coach would use Giannis like any traditional superstar big. In the post and moving him off ball, getting him the ball in the paint. And actually utilizing the pick n roll. Not trying to use him like he’s Damian lillard like bud does   Tatum can definitely score from anywhere, but he’s inconsistent as fuck, 3/15 6/20 3/12 will never ever cut it, ever."
Damian Lillard is an overrated and similarly more efficient version of Allen Iverson.

"Collins' qualifying offer is $7M for one year, in what universe is he taking less than that?  If the Blazers don't offer him the QO he's a free-agent &amp; gone, so at a minimum he's making $7M next season and then who knows beyond that.  When you trade up to #10 overall to take a guy, you hope for more than ""bench enforcer to use 6 hard fouls,"" especially when you have a top 10 player in Damian Lillard and a core that's ready to win ASAP.  If you aren't holding onto the 11 games from 2019 when we last saw him, what gives you hope that Collins is actually an NBA player?  In his first 2 years he had problems beating out Meyers Leonard, Moe Harkless &amp; Al Farooq Aminu for minutes and his play was really, really inconsistent.  He's a stretch 5 that doesn't actually stretch the floor, has poor touch around the rim, doesn't rebound particularly well and can't defend without fouling.  Even when he's been on the court, we haven't seen Collins put together 2 solid weeks of play.  And I mean... you replied to me when we're talking about how Dame needs help &amp; I brought up a bad miss from the FO to get Dame quality players to help out with ""he's an enforcer and we can keep paying him at an unrealistically cheap number"" so yeah, evaluating Collins vs. the opportunity cost of drafting someone good matters.  And again, even if we take away who else the Blazers could have drafted, he's basically given the Blazers sub-replacement level play over 4 years."

Damian Lillard.  Super talented offensively never seems to have quite enough help.  Can throw it in from anywhere.
I believe it 100%.  I've heard from solid sources that many in the locker room were not a fan of this guy during his Portland days while Dame was there.  The funniest I heard was Chris Kaman couldn't stand his ass lol.  Great article on his relationship with Dame [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.blazersedge.com/platform/amp/2015/3/16/8225339/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-chris-kaman-friends)
"Can’t post the charts put here’s the text if you don’t wanna click:  Damian Lillard had reason to believe that Portland’s fans would make a difference in his first-round series against the Nuggets.   The Trail Blazers were the last NBA team to start allowing fans into their home arena this season—much to Lillard’s chagrin. But once they did, the Trail Blazers went 4-0 in home games with fans, including crucial wins over the Lakers and Nuggets that helped Portland avoid the play-in tournament.    The Ringer’s NBA Odds Machine  So good, it should come with a spoiler alert  Moreover, Portland has seemingly benefited from an extreme home-court advantage in recent playoff history. From 2013-14, Lillard’s first postseason, through 2018-19, the last postseason before the home-court-free bubble, the Trail Blazers were a miserable 6-21 on the road in playoff games—but against those same teams at home, they were a much better 13-11. That gap represented one of the largest home-court advantages in the league.   So in advance of Game 3 in the Blazers’ first-round series, with the Moda Center allowing four times the capacity that it did during the regular season, Lillard conveyed confidence in his home crowd. “We know that our crowd is loud, our crowd has pride, they really care, and they gonna come ready,” Lillard said. “I know that’s going to play in our favor.”  And then the Trail Blazers lost Game 3 in front of those loud, prideful, caring fans, before winning Game 4 to salvage a split at home—just as they’d split the two games in Denver to open the series. It turns out neither team’s home-court advantage mattered at all.  But it’s not just Lillard, and it’s not just Portland vs. Denver. Across the league, home-court advantage has disappeared in this postseason—even as fans flock to arenas in their greatest numbers since the start of the pandemic, and even as players, coaches, and owners express excitement to play in front of the cheering masses once again.   “It’ll be pretty special for our fans, just to have our fans in the building and make us proud,” LeBron James said before the first Lakers’ home playoff games in eight years, and his first in Los Angeles. “That’s what I came here for, is to play a playoff game in front of the Lakers faithful.”  Except like Lillard’s Trail Blazers, LeBron’s Lakers split their two home games—just as they’d split their two road games in Phoenix. Home-court advantage didn’t matter one bit.  Through 32 playoff games thus far, two home and two road for each club, home teams are 16-16. In the 16-team playoff era, home teams’ winning percentage has never been close to this low—except last year, in the bubble, when “home-court advantage” by definition didn’t exist.    The same is true for point differential, rather than pure win-loss record. Historically, home teams have won their playoff games by an average of four to five points per game—but this postseason, that average is down to 0.9 through 32 games, in line with the bubble playoffs (1.0) for the lowest by far.    Typically, the NBA’s home-court advantage is one of the strongest across the major North American sports, and it tends to increase in the postseason. From the expansion of the postseason bracket to 16 teams in 1983-84 through the 2018-19 season, home teams won 61 percent of their games in the regular season and 65 percent of their games in the playoffs. (That pattern holds even accounting for the fact that better teams play more home games in the playoffs. FiveThirtyEight’s Neil Paine calculated the same playoff boost of 4 percentage points even with this adjustment.)   But this postseason has been different. Since the introduction of the shot clock, 88 best-of-seven series before this season had started with the home teams winning four games in a row. For comparison, only six had started with the road teams winning four games in a row, meaning a home sweep of games 1 through 4 was 15 times more likely than a road sweep. Yet this year, no series started with four home wins in a row, while Clippers-Mavericks saw four consecutive road wins.  That’s just one data point, but it sure fits the larger pattern.  Best-of-Seven Series to Start With Four Road Wins  2021 First Clippers Mavericks ???  2017 First Celtics Bulls Celtics 4-2  2005 First Mavericks Rockets Mavericks 4-3  1995 Conference Finals Spurs Rockets Rockets 4-2  1994 Second Rockets Suns Rockets 4-3  1969 First Lakers Warriors Lakers 4-2  1963 Conference Finals* Celtics Royals Celtics 4-3  *Unlike the other series in this chart, which used the standard 2-2 format for the first four games, the Celtics and Royals alternated home courts for every game of their 1963 series. The sudden diminishment of home-court advantage could wreak unexpected effects on this postseason. Game 7s might not favor the home team as much as usual, for instance, and the presumed powerhouse clash between the Nets and Bucks in the second round might not hinge on the Nets’ home-court advantage. The Lakers could win the title without hosting Game 1 in any round.   It’s still early in the playoffs, so the advantage could still tilt back toward the home teams in a Game 7, or in later rounds. And all this analysis comes with the caveat that injuries to stars have seemingly affected teams more at home thus far: Donovan Mitchell missed a home game for Utah; Anthony Davis missed half a home game for the Lakers; Kemba Walker and Robert Williams missed the same home game for Boston. (Injuries do go both ways, though: The 76ers’ Joel Embiid missed most of Game 4, helping Washington to a home win.)  Yet this phenomenon fits with a recent trend in the regular season, too. From 1984 through 2013, home teams’ winning percentage in the regular season never dipped below 60 percent leaguewide for more than one season in a row. But it’s been below 60 for eight regular seasons in a row now—reaching an all-time low, of course, this season, when most games had no crowds at all.    ESPN’s Kevin Pelton found that home-court advantage was stronger in games with fans this regular season, but in the postseason, teams with more fans aren’t benefiting from the extra crowd size. In fact, the correlation between attendance and home point differential is negative-0.22 so far, meaning more fans are associated with a worse performance from the home team.   Don’t read into that figure too far. The quality of the teams allowing larger crowds somewhat scrambles this analysis—for instance, Miami could bring in 17,000 fans per home game, while Milwaukee was allotted just 9,100 in its first-round sweep. But as this graph shows, there’s also no evidence that larger crowds have helped the home team this postseason.    Crowds have helped the overall product, as players clearly enjoy competing in front of fans and the television viewing experience improves immensely with thousands of chanting, cheering mouths working in unison. (They’ve also exposed a considerably uglier side, throwing popcorn and water bottles, and hurling spit and offensive invectives toward players and their families.)  But improving the general NBA experience is distinct from improving a specific team’s chances. Consider the Clippers and Mavericks once more: After much discourse around Mark Cuban’s desire to pack Dallas’s home arena, the Mavericks found enough legislative leeway to get to more than 17,700 fans for both home games—the highest attendance for any team in the postseason. Dallas proceeded to lose both home games anyway.  As Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said before those losses, “Just because you’re home doesn’t mean you’re going to walk out there and win a game. You’ve still got to keep doing the things that you’ve been doing well in previous games   I didn’t particularly care for this article that I read"
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Kevin Durant 7. Trae Young 8. Joel Embiid 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Lebron James 13. Ja Morant 14. Mike Conley 15. Derrick Rose
AD lost ROY to Damian Lillard actually  Tyreke was 3 drafts prior to AD
"Okay.   1. Kawhi Leonard. Averaging 33 ppg on 10/21 from 3 and 2 double doubles so far  2. Luka Doncic. Averaging 33 even with only scoring 19 one game with a neck injury. Also has a triple double so far  3. Kevin Durant. Averaging 33 ppg on very efficient shooting  4. Joel Embiid. If you take out the game where he got injured and only played 11 mins, he's averaging 29 ppg with great defense  5. Jokic. 31 ppg, and 2 double doubles  6. Harden. 26 ppg and 11 assists per game so far  7. Trae Young. 27 ppg and 10 assists  8. Damian Lillard. Had one stinker where he only scored 10, but before that was averaging 37 ppg.   9. Lebron James. Not his best series, but still putting up 22 ppg and 8.5 assists  10. Giannis. In a sweep, put up 23 ppg and 15 rpg  Bonus. Both Devin Booker and Chris Paul. I didn't even mention Anthony Davis. Ayton is the fifth most impactful player in his own series"
"The “people” you speak of are mostly media pundits or casual fans. Everyone in the NBA knows and understands Jokic’s dominance because they witness it first hand.   It’s all a moot point though because DEN has already committed to Jamal Murray and likely will do so with MPJ. It’s unlikely they will have any salary cap room left over to attract anyone besides MLE tier players for the next 4 years anyway. It’s sad because we would be witnessing some awesome basketball if Jokic ever got paired with someone like Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, or Trae Young."
Damian Lillard.
I really like watching Damian Lillard play.
