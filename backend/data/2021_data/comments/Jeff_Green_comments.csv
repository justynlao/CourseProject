Wait so  KD - batman  Harden - Robin  Irving - Alfred  Jeff Green - Bat girl  Joe Harris - Cat woman
"Good physical defense and he was able to hold his position on post-ups due to his strength. They ran Jeff Green at C against the Clippers so the expectation was that you had guard who you were on, regardless of switches. Defense looked smoother, albeit still scrambling to recover. They forced the Clippers to play Marcus Morris at C, which likely helped the Nets play better switching defense."
"I’d even place him a cut above. Jeff showed so much (albeit reconstructed w a pig valve) heart against the baby Celts in game 7 ECF 2018, Bron couldn’t do it alone and the Celtics win that game if JG doesn’t go off.   I was perpetually frustrated with his celtics youth as he’d go from beating the miami big 3 on the best buzzer beater of the 2010s, to flirting w TS% around 40 for weeks, but that G7 w the Cavs was so efficient and professional, I couldn’t help but feel proud of how much he’d grown, all he’d overcome to get to be a top performer in the biggest game of his life.   I cursed when we traded him for Ray, then cursed again when we got him back for Perk, but I’ll always love Jeff Green for all I rose and fell with every hill and valley if his career."
Jeff Green is an 80%+ FT shooter as well.
"It's not that, but Jeff Green at the 5 is not a winning solution.  Fix that and they're fine"
And then two possessions in a row in the fourth were Jeff Green bricks. Balance.
I envisioned that Jeff Green would be doing the bulk of the scoring
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"I love how much of a vet Jeff Green is. Watching him on the Rockets last year, he is always calm, collected and I always feel comfort in that he's gonna make the right play in any situation."
Wiggins is looking like what I thought Jeff green would be
Clippers might have won without Reggies pull up 3 and his foul on Jeff green
"Awesome!  I know you guys don't care about this story, but I did something like this once as a player. The opposing team was pressing so I went into the other side of the court for the long pass and easy layup. It was awesome! Jeff Green is going to remember this moment for the rest of his life."
You can tell exactly when the Clippers knew they fucked up by leaving Jeff Green all alone under their basket.
"Now that we're not playing Jordan to close out games, yeah. He's historically bad, but he's only playing like 15 minutes a game, Jeff Green getting the bulk."
Jeff Green revenge game. Sign me up
Jeff green of all people with the clutchest shot
"  Imagine Kevin Durant getting hot. You have to focus on him. Then there’s James Harden, one of the greatest scorers of all time. You have to focus on him. Kyrie Irving, one of the most efficient players of all time. You have to focus on him too. Then, that’s not even the end. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the league. You have to focus on him. And then there’s, Jeff Green. He’s not gonna do anything, right??? Other than shoot over 45% from 3......  This Nets team might be as good as the 2017 Warriors."
Jeff Green has been redeemed by Batum.
Why jeff green
"If they manage to lose this shit is all on Jeff green, make the fuckin FT man"
Jeff motherfucking Green
U gotta foul the fuck outta Jeff Green there   Silly shit
Jeff Green 2000 iq play to seal the game.
Jeff Green the best closer on the Nets
Jeff green idiot
"Fuckin Jeff green man, make that shit"
HARDEN TD THROW TO JEFF GREEN
JEFF GREEN WE KNEW IT ALL ALONG
got got by jeff the green
Clippers really left Jeff Green unnoticed on the other side of the court lmfao
Does Harden get the assist for that Jeff Green touchdown?
LMAO JEFF GREEN
Wow what a smart play. Jeff green waited to get fouled lol
That’s a great play by harden and Jeff green
JEFF GREEN
I didn’t realize Jeff green was on the nets too. They def need to get Westbrook and just run okc back as  adults in New York
No dude he’s watched every single Jeff Green game in his career. Who would make baseless assumptions off of one game? No one in this sub and I know that for a fact.
Jeff Green is such a bum
Jeff Green need to come home
Jeff Green and Landry Shamet keeping LA in it
I remember OKC had a year where they almost got Tyson Chandler. But something with physicals that stopped that trade (Jeff Green heart condition IIRC).... That team was always what might have been.
Nets have one guy out there playing defense right now- jeff green.  KD is even laying off everyone.
I feel like the Nets don’t want Jeff Green shootin 7 shots with this many weapons (especially since he’s only made 1)
KD PLEASE TOUCH THE FUCKING BALL YOURE LITERALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST WHY IS JEFF GREEN TOUCHING IT MORE THAN YOU
If the nets lose Jeff Green won’t be the sole reason but he’ll be a big one
"Got KD, Harden, Ibaka, Jeff Green here. All we need is Russy, Nick Collison, and Eric Maynor."
"There is literally no one on the Nets that can reliably defend at the 5 position, and it's baffling that the organization hasn't picked up any rim protector better than Jeff Green or DJ."
Seems like the strategy is to let Jeff Green beat you.   Hope those shots don't start falling.
"Much like Rudy Gay, Jeff Green is one of those guys who has all the tool to be a star player but never puts it all together"
Jeff green is a really really good role player.
Jeff Green is in a different time zone from the nearest defender and can’t hit.
Jeff green MAKE YOUR OPEN SHOTS
"it’s true, but there are tons of role players who have not had anywhere close to the career Jeff Green has had"
Jeff Green at the 5 - yikes
Man Jeff Green has to hit these
[Jeff Green looks like that actor from The Terminator 2](https://d3d8y6yhucfd29.cloudfront.net/sports-product-image/1-t8003309-.jpg)
Glad to see Jeff Green doing well. He balled the fuck out for us last year.
Has Jeff Green missed as a Net?
where my boy jeff green at
"Harden, KD, Ibaka, Jeff Green, Paul George, Patrick Patterson, and Reggie Jackson all played for OKC at some point. Am I missing anyone?"
"At no point in the last five years did I think I'd watch Reggie Jackson, Paul George, Ibaka, Harden, Durant and Jeff Green all on the court at the same time I hate it"
"&gt; Roster's not yet finished  They just signed Norvel Pelle and Iman Shumpert. This alone should give you an indication of the ""talent"" that's available out there. They're also thinking about converting their 2-way contracts into regular ones so they can sign 2 more 2-way contracts, and are reportedly looking at their G-League affiliate for candidates.  Also people keep repeating they'll be able to solve their problems on the buyout market with their tax-MLE of $5.7M and DPE of $5.7M (which cannot be combined). Who on the projected buyout market is going to be available for such limited salary that can legitimately solve their defense and depth issues? They can't just sign a bunch of meh players either because most of their roster isn't composed of 2-way players, so they're going to have to work wonders with the $5.7M MLE and $5.7 DPE.   Given that Kyrie/Harden/KD score a combined 90-ish points, just 1 of them missing a game means that Joe Harris and Jeff Green are going to have to go nuclear.  The buyout market signings, whenever they happen, are also going to require another ""geling"" period... I'm not sure when this team is going to finish geling and actually become a finished product. It'll probably be closer to playoff time than comfortable."
"As someone who watched a ton of Houston games the last couple of years, Jeff green at the 5 in short bursts works wonderfully. Something about playing with harden just seems to unlock his ability to play at his best. That said, they definitely need a legit 5 to hold the fort for most of the game"
If **Jeff Green** can hold up in the postseason I’ll have his name tattooed on my ass.   I’ve witnessed the breakdown more than once. He’s one of those players who annoys you when he’s on another team (cause he’s solid in the regular season) but annoys you so much more when he’s on your’s (postseason).
"What's interesting is our small ball lineups with Jeff green at the 5 and Harris, Durant, kyrie and harden have only allowed 106 points per 100 which would be elite while scoring 123. If that lineup can hold up defensively it will be absolutely devastate teams in crunch time"
I want to see:  Kyrie/Harden/Harris/KD/Jeff Green   vs.  Lou/PG/Batum/Kawhi/Morris  Gimme all the offense.
Love me some Jeff green
I’m not sure KD goes to the Finals with Jeff Green and TT
Pleasant: Jeff Green  Unpleasant: Landry Shamet
Pleasant: Jeff Green  Unpleasant: Shamet
Jeff Green I guess
"I love the Nets matchup for us. They have absolutely nothing to stop Giannis one on one in half court or transition, nor are they remotely capable of building a wall and zoning him out as currently constructed. Middleton they might be ok with but I don’t see their guards having a very good time with Jrue driving to the rim either.  KD and Harden can pull up for days but if I’m picking between literally anybody taking pull up jumpers over Lopez drops and Giannis taking on Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan at the rim that’s not a contest."
"You got downvoted, but the proof is there in the +/-. Jeff Green played for much of the 3rd and is -19 despite a great shooting night. If a team gets a run of 10 straight points (with or without answer) more than once a game, it reduces morale of the opponents a LOT"
"Deandre Jordan plays \~20 mins a night. The backup center is a rookie so they just play KD or Jeff Green at center half the game.   Kyrie is small so he can't affect shots as well even if he's putting in the effort on D.   Broadly speaking they have a very small and light team, even on the bench a lot of their players strong enough to be great rebounders for their position or box out every play as well. Harden was actually an upgrade in rebounding from Lavert, but he didn't play tn,"
"Excuse me, Jeff Green 23 points? What the actual fuck was this game"
Jeff Green was there and thought to be a cornerstone.
Lol we had Jeff Green at 5 last year in the playoffs against OKC  Yielded some interesting results.
Jeff Green
Must be talking about former star Jeff “my name is Jeffff” Green. He was also a teammate on OKC.
Jeff green is just a better player honestly
What happened to DJ? Jeff Green is replacing his role as a small ball center. Morey-ball is slowly taking over
"The trade only works with one of DJ, Dinwiddie or Joe Harris in it (excluding the big 3). Everyone else on the roster adds up to about 10 million (that's including Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green who will only be tradeable next month).  So realistically, only way it gets done is if the Nets trade Dinwiddie+filler for Redick just from a contracts perspective."
Jeff Green at the 5 seems likes a disaster come playoffs
he meant jeff green haha jk
"I don’t think they would’ve scored more. If Harden played, Joe Harris and Jeff Green would not have scored as much"
Two many time all stars out there and Joe Harris and Jeff Green combining for over 50 and they still can't beat the worst in the league.
"The loss doesn't even matter.  Even if they won by getting the ball in and hitting two more free throws, it would have meant that they needed to score 148 points in regulation to just barely get by a 3-12 team. KD, Kyrie, Harris, and even Jeff Green all had great games, but they still would have needed to put up historic scoring numbers to beat a 3-12 team.   The thing is that they don't even need to be good on defense. If they can score like this consistently, they can even be a bit below-average and still win. They need to do something to get to that slightly below-average level instead of the league-worst level they are right now."
Oh Jeff green I was finna say man
"As a DMV resident that followed KD to the Thunder watching my favorite player on the Wizards with Scott Brooks coaching against KD, Harden and Jeff Green is so weird"
Looks like the wizards are not deterred by the rim protection of Jeff Green
Jeff Green having himself a SEASON 😤
Jeff Green eh
Jeff Green deserves a fucking BAG
Jeff Green is the real superstar.
Jeff Green has been everything.
I know he doesn't but your PF rotation is basically KD/Jeff Green. The fact that you need to start a SG at PF says a lot.
Kyrie/Bruce Brown/Joe Harris/Jeff Green/DeAndre Jordan is honestly kinda good in this scenario
I can see Kyrie Irving or Jeff Green becoming coaches in the future.
"It’s embarrassing that people think Jonathan Clay Redick would be useless on the Brooklyn Nets. He would for sure get ~20mpg in the playoffs off the bench.   There’s currently only one player on the bench that I trust to be part of the playoff rotation in Jeff Green and he’s going to get most his minutes at the 5 in the playoffs. Bruce Brown is decent, but Jonathan Clay Redick would be an upgrade.   If all it took was Spencer Dinwiddie and a second round pick... I’d do it instantly. The Brooklyn Nets need a power forward, wing or guard more than a center. The center position is overrated in 2021. Not worried at all when they have 5.7M to offer to two players (each) in the buyout market.   The Brooklyn Nets have only one open roster spot left? I didn’t know you couldn’t waive players on teams anymore...."
Honestly I'd rather Jeff Green back up big by a lotttt
"He'll play some, but Jeff Green is already a small ball center. DeAndre is still the starter and Nic Claxton is already forcing the issue.   In all honestly, I don't think Blake is going to play all that much unless there's an injury"
"So outside of the obvious guys that will still see a lot of play (KD, Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Brown), it boils down to whether or not it's possible that Blake ends up being better than any of these guys:  -DJ: 22mpg  -Jeff Green: 26mpg  -Landry Shamet: 20mpg  -TLC: 20mpg  -Claxton: 15mpg  Some of this comes down to the matchups(Claxton and DJ) but I can realistically see Blake getting a decent chunk of the Shamet/TLC minutes, or at least Nash experimenting with that.   It's a low risk/potentially solid reward move. There's very little downside since he's on a vet min contract and even though he's having a bad year right now, I think he's still probably a better overall player compared to TLC/Shamet.  He's a pretty good passer/playmaker, so having another one of those in the second unit alongside Harden (mostly to punish double teams) is going to be really helpful.    It also lets them play a little bigger when they are still playing small."
"It’s subtraction by addition imo. DJ is already a good fit offensively, and Jeff Green is perfect. If you could stick a controller up his ass and make him be all star Clint Capela then yeah he’d be great, but I don’t think a rookie head coach who has already shown to have a guard heavy system is gonna be able to make him play like that. Even if it is a first ballot HOFer."
"We'll need to start rotating our lines like in hockey.  KD, Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ is the first line.  Shamet, Blake, Drummond, Jeff Green, Clax is the second line.  Then we need a roster expansion and our third line can be: Roberson, Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC.  Our 3rd line is defense and hustle guys.   We should do line changes after made baskets or during fast breaks.  Shamet probably drops to third line and it becomes a big deal that Bruce Brown or TLC make top 10."
"They weren't all on the roster at the same time (mostly talking Jeff Green+Perk), but that was one of the first teams I thought of (after the 04 Lakers)"
[2010-2011 Celtics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2011.html)  Rondo/Nate Robinson/Carlos Arroyo  Ray Allen/Avery Bradley/Delonte West  Paul Pierce/Jeff Green/Marquis Daniels  Kevin Garnett/Glen Davis/Nenad Krstic  Shaq/Jermaine O'Neal/Kendrick Perkins
"Already know 2011 celtics is the best ever. KG, Pierce, Allen, Rondo, Shaq, Perk, Bradley, jeff green,"
"While you make a bunch of great points, i just think you're not realizing he's taking up a playoff slot. The #1 need for the Nets is not necessarily veteran presence, but defenders. No one on that team that will be playing in the playoffs rotation needs a veteran around for the locker room. Jeff Green and DJ already fill the useless/slightly useful veteran presence.  I just see it as a bad pick up that takes away another vet minimum in a very cap strapped team and playoff slot for a team that needs additional help on the other side of the floor."
"Jeff Green is waaaayyyy better than old man Blake.    Blake’s PER for the Pistons was at 13th, only above 3 Pistons g-leaguers"
Jeff Green and Claxton have been better than Blake this year
"&gt; Even the worst Blake Griffin is better than those guys.  As a Pistons fan, I can confidently inform you that Jeff Green is considerably more effective at NBA basketball than Blake Griffin.   &gt; People need to realize that this team is better with Blake than without him  That remains to be seen. The Pistons are one of the worst teams in the NBA, yet they were better without him than with him."
"good signs!! lets see what happens in the playoffs! Jeff green is great too, not surprised to hear he lead that meeting. Nets will need him to keep that leadership role."
Please explain with Jordan and now Griffin there as well as Jeff Green who plays a lot of small ball 5?
"Plenty of contending teams all called Blake when he got waived   I think it’s safe to say the Lakers, heat, Nets, etc. All know more than you   He was still trying to create shots and yeah he doesn’t dunk, cause he’s a high post player now. His athleticism isn’t there but he’s a ball handler and a jump shooter now   All he has to do is do what Jeff green does. Sit in the corner and wait for open shots, maybe if he’s good enough, create a shot or two a game. And stay in front of his man at a decent rate   Blake can do what Jeff green does. I’m sure of that. Is he gonna be all nba level? Definitely not. But is he gonna contribute in 10-20 minutes a game, yeah he will. And that’s what all these other contending teams believe as well  Don’t think you’re smarter than the leagues best"
"We’ve already seen how they responded when things don’t go as planned. After the odd game where KD was ineligible, then eligible, then out again we hit a 3 game skid culminating in a loss to Detroit. After that game, there was a team meeting led by Jeff Green. DJ was called out for his effort. Since then we’ve won 10 of the last 11 games and are one of the hottest teams in the league."
With everyone playing it has been and will be Harris-KD at the forward spots.   With KD out it's been Bruce Brown I guess. They play a really small lineup. There's also Jeff Green who plays either at the 4 or small ball 5.
"I mean...   We’re not expecting him to be the old Blake, leading the team as the #1 option.  He’s our Jeff Green insurance. He does everything we need. He’ll be able to pick n roll, and either pop for a shot, pass it out or roll. He’ll be asked to make the right play and keep the ball moving or take the open shot kyrie or harden create for him. As the 10th man on this team, on a vet min deal... it’s such low risk/high upside. This doesn’t move the needle for a championship, but it improves our depth. We had 3 open spots, so why not?"
"His defense is alright. He’s got good positioning and help defense. He’s gonna at least be as good at Jeff green on defense, probably better tho  Depending on how good he can get his catch and shoot shot up. But he’s gonna get open corner shots all day.   So playmaking, a big who shoots better than Perry/DJ/Claxton, defense better than Green. And that’s if Blake is bad. If he’s good then you’ll get a decent rim runner, a good shooter and experience"
"I don't think people understand the context of this signing.  He went from being the #1 option to being the 11th guy on the bench, as insurance for Jeff Green. He'll be fighting for minutes with Claxton. We had 3 backend roster spots open. Plus we got him for the vet min. Such a low risk/high reward signing."
"Im talking about the nets can sign another good player like drummond in the buyout market, that moves blake griffin to the pf position, and lets be honest, he is better than claxton how has never been in the playoffs and is too skinny to play pf and c , griffin is also better than jeff green  if you think blake griffin doesnt help the nets bench , you're severly mistaken"
"Bruce Brown and Jeff Green will out-avg BG, calling it now"
"Yeah I don't think he's not gonna start. I feel like Bruce Brown or Jeff Green are probably gonna be the ones left out. It'll be Harden, Kyrie, KD, DJ, and Harris starting.  But then again I became a Nets fan like 6 weeks ago so what do I know."
"The supporting cast beside the Big 3 is better than you think. Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Claxton have been solid. Joe Harris is putting up some of the best shooting numbers in the league. Bruce Brown plays great defense and picks up a lot of easy buckets off cuts. Small sample size for Claxton so I won't speak on him. With the big three, Jordan, and I guess Griffin if he can still move, that's still 8-9 deep which is all you should run in playoffs. Very few teams run 10+ players every night during playoffs."
jeff green deserves to play
"Blake is going from being asked to be The Man in Detroit to become insurance for Jeff Green.   We had 3 open roster spots, so why the fuck not. We had the MLE and DPE to spend. As a 10th man, BG can still contribute.  I'm excited to see Brooklyn Blake. Our rehab team will be able to get the best of whatever he has left."
lol are you serious. have you seen Blake this season? He was legit one of the worst players in the league playing heavy minutes. He's gonna back up Jeff Green and play against other bench units.  i wouldn't be surprised if he DNP the entire playoffs. he's too much of a defensive liability.
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3. Bobby Simmons 4. **Matt Barnes** 5. Grant Hill 6. Lamar Odom 7. **Jared Dudley** 8. Danny Granger 9. Antawn Jamison 10. Stephen Jackson 11. Hedo Turkoglu 12. Reggie Bullock 13. Dahntay Jones 14. Jordan Hamilton 15. **Paul Pierce** 16. Lance Stephenson 17. **Jeff Green** 18. **Wesley Johnson** 19. Josh Smith 20. **Luc Mbah a Moute**"
"Bruh you’re just in denial. I’ve been saying why they’re better this whole time. The three stars are way better, we have the best 3 point shooter in the league, we have Bruce Brown and Jeff Green playing better than any of your role players, Claxton is emerging as another great role player, we’re going to get Blake Griffin. Are you really unable to see that? Have you even watched the games? Or do you just think the Lakers are good because the won last year? News flash: Last year is irrelevant now since the Nets created a super team"
What’s crazy is guys like Bruce brown and Jeff green are also at like 62% true shooting.  I think Nash and dantoni deserve a lot of credit this offense is truly ridiculous
"The whole interview was really good. Love hearing stories of the Sloan days because the organization and its players never opened the proverbial curtains to the public when Sloan was coaching.   It definitely stings hearing Deron basically say what we all knew though with respect to player recruitment. I know Donovan and Conley have put some effort into recruiting, but as far as I know the best the Jazz have done was get Jeff Green and Ed Davis, both of whom were terrible."
"I was taking a weighted average of the Celtics roster.  Theis=5th man.  Semi, Javonte Green, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters &amp; Jeff Teague are all 11th-14th men to out of the league so they drag him down with them."
"Yeah that's why I hate all the ""there's no defense in today's NBA"" talk, no there's just so much talent that you can't take away everything.  Like your team, you can't afford to close out to Jeff Green for example, and he's shooting great from 3 this season, but you just can't take him away when you already have that much talent around.  Same for say DiVincenzo in Milwaukee"
"Not really. Jeff Green is solid and proven. Claxton is actually talented, same as Bruce Brown. It's the little shooting guards who are inconsistent and that's our strongest position. A bigman addition for insurance in the front count and we are an ok bench."
Rudy Gobert would get abused when they go small and play Jeff Green at the 5. Brooklyn is a bad matchup for Utah in my opinion.
"DeAndre Ayton was abused down the stretch vs the Nets, Ive never seen a 1st round pick big man like him get absolutely neutralized like that. Harden picked up on him deliberately  Jeff Green and other smaller players were easily boxing him out for boards under the rim and he couldn't get any lift to get his hands on the ball once, nor did he take advantage of any size mismatch he had under the rim. Players were driving right at him at the end of the game, and he was even more ineffective on offense"
I think Jeff Green is gonna get the start over Clax and DJ when he's 100% again.
Yeah very interested to see the changes. Think Embiid was even hotter than normal today so perhaps don't want to overreact. I think the Jazz do struggle a bit with their help the helper defence as Gobert almost never needs it. Royce is a monster but a bit undersized to be helping under the rim and giving Gobert support. Weird to say it but the Jazz could really have used a Jeff Green (I know he was awful for you guys) but his size at the 4 spot is invaluable.
"Just went back to check. The starting five of the 2008 Rookie Team was composed of Al Horford (21), Kevin Durant (19), Jeff Green (21), Mike Conley (20), and Luis Scola (27 years young) lol"
"Every time someone mentions X player is playing pretty good this season, 9 times out of 10 dude is averaging 40% from 3.   Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nicholas Batum, and even Jeff Green are all averaging above 40%.  Frank Kraminsky is averaging 42%.  Even Kent Bazemore.  Come on."
Jeff Green is still pretty valuable but I guess he is expendable now Claxton is emerging
"Browns my favorite but the Nets offense is all about spacing, like we need at least 4 capable 3 pt shooters, and as much as I love Brown I have to acknowledge the 3’s he makes are way more luck than anything haha. But his role as a small ball Center with Jeff Green on the floor as well for size could be super interesting.  I think it’s TLC at the bottom actually but he might be able to scoop up some wing minutes considering he’s a long lanky body. He’s just the most inconsistent player, he’ll go 5/6 from 3 vs the Lakers then 1/7 from 3 vs the Mavs, but I guess that’s just the nature of role players, especially ones that are getting paid the minimum."
"Even if he gets it together and turns into some version of current Jeff Green, he's still a bust."
"I wonder if the coaching staff gets some props for coaching up the rest of the squad as well. Aside from Harris, and young deandre, the rest of the team is whatever. Lol of course with those 3 players maybe you need just bodies and that is it. Oh and jeff green. He has been playing well"
"But it'd be better than Jeff Green guarding Embiid 40 minutes, and him being on Embiid with a double coming anytime he gets low post position would work well enough to force the other Sixers make plays. That's why Embiid's numbers have dipped when teams brought help against Embiid and the Sixers had to adjust.   They probably won't be good enough to win with Embiid forced to give it up in the playoffs vs KD and Kyrie. It would be Nets in 6/7"
"Randle, Green, Griffin and Siakam all have had more opportunities than him? They've been  ball handlers on their team while Zion just started doing so. Before this month he rarely dribbled the ball up court. AD, Jeff Green, Thad Young and Batum I just don't agree with, especially since a guy like Batum's natural position is the 3. Never thought of Nance but he is a good passer, Love as well."
"Green, Randle, AD, Love, Griffin, Siakam. Sabonis, Nance, Thad Young, Jeff Green, Batum and probably more. He’s a good passer, but most guys don’t get the opportunities to pass like he’d does and they don’t have the easy reads that his offensive ability makes for him."
Feel like he and Jeff Green are pretty redundant. Jeff Green is playing well this season too.
"You’re making up more then half of these lol ‘weak East’ doesn’t make sense bc with 3 disgustingly elite all nba players it’s a weak *league* compared to them. No one measure against them. Everyone understands this   No depth- yes and no.  Johnson and Shamet, inexplicably, weren’t playing. Jeff green and TLC are solid. Claxton doesn’t even count. So they do not have a big. So even with the guys listed they kinda don’t have depth. However it may not matter bc come playoffs teams gon down to 9,8 man rotations. And they’re so good with the big 3. Again, people understand this   ‘Nets will struggle to re-integrate KD’. Again, who on earth has said this? KD is universally known s the most maleable, water-like star. Not to mention all 3 guys have been in and out anyway"
I don’t think you’re wrong. Johnson and shamet are just decent player. But if you compare them to like a Wesley Matthew it’s not that different. Johnson in particular has been consistently solid.   Besides we have 7 players that are gonna see mins in the playoffs who have been solid all year. Big 3 - joe Harris - Jeff green - dj - tlc.  Tlc and dj are obviously weaker players but they’ve shown they can at least 10-15 against top teams   The rest of the guys will play 30+. We also have Bruce brown who has been fantastic for us.   We are deeper than we seem right now
"As someone who's all aboard this Nets train. Some of these criticisms are valid. But the Nets have too much talent for it to really matter.  The depth thing... The starting 5 + Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are a solid first 7.  But let's not pretend Claxton is a sure thing. We've seen absolutely nothing from him in his first year and a half because of injury and he's thin as a rail. The Nets depth issue is another strong interior player not guard play and it affects the teams issue to get defensive boards and end possession.  It's a legit concern, but I mean KD/Harden/Kyrie makes it almost irrelevant."
Jeff green seems like a cool guy
"Yeah and Jeff Green was hyped for it, the opposite of this lol."
I also love Jeff Green waving him off and you can see DJ's thumbs down creeping into the pic while he's on the court lmao.
"Lakers (I’m assuming LBJ) didn’t want him back... Now they have Gasol who literally does nothing on the court but be tall... Watched the Nets vs Lakers game... Jeff Green, Harden, Kyrie, and everyone else made him look like a caution cone... Then they laughed at him during the timeouts..."
going with bballref   PG: Jokic but guarding the worst player on the floor  SG: Jeff Green cause apparently he is a center and someone needs to defend the guards  SF: Bam  PF: Embiid  C: Gobert
"It gets illustrated even more when you putdown the depth charts:  **PG:** Walker/Dragic, Pritchard/Nunn, Teague/Bradley.  **SG:** Smart/Robinson, Nesmith/Herro, Green/Vincent.  **SF:** Brown/Butler, Williams/Harkless, Strus, Okpala.  **PF:** Tatum/Olynyk, Theis/Iguodala, Ojeleye/Precious.  **C:** Thompson/Adebayo, Williams/Haslem or Silva, Tacko/Haslem or Silva.  &amp;#x200B;  Pretty loose because they use a lot of guys in different positions, but once you get past the starters on each team the Heat can still put out Nunn, Bradley, Herro, Iguodala, Precious who are all more than capable of producing quality minutes. Once you go past the starters for the Celtics, you're banking on unproven rookies and Theis, Williams^(2) and Jeff Teague to do the heavy lifting."
"No Jeff green Tonight, would love to see clax guard vuc as he’s probably going to do a better job than DJ"
What kind of gm even makes these comments?  I left the Celtics fanbase when they traded Perkins for a guy coming off open heart surgery (I love Jeff Green btw) and Nenad Krstic.  I just felt like they stopped caring about winning a title and more about money.
"Tbh yes I did see the potential in Bruce Brown, Shamet is still playing worse than he has in past seasons, and Jeff Green was really good this year without Harden too. This is not to say Harden isn't one of the best floor raisers, but those are kind of poor examples. The example I would've used is DeAndre Jordan who was a bona fide scrub this season before Harden and has turned into a passable starting center with Harden."
It's because DeAndre Jordan gets a lot more minutes in games vs sub .500 teams.  While the Nets best defensive lineup has Jeff Green in for DeAndre Jordan as a small 5.
"If Harden has a lob threat then he can handle Gobert fairly easily - I don't think Jeff Green is tall enough to be an effective lob threat, so will be interesting to see if DJ gets a lot of minutes and how effective that is, or KD at the 5 and just spam Harden-KD PnR's (KD probably can't catch and dunk lobs over Gobert tho, or maybe only a few max per game, he hasn't really regressed in terms of production but you can tell he's lost some explosiveness/speed)."
"Well he attacked Russell Westbrook's knee and caused him an injury that plagued him for years. Just this last week he mocked Jeff Green after injuring him.  He comes across to me as a petty, dirty player who is annoying to watch, and if you're willing to play dangerously and hurt people, then my opinion doesn't change if you're nice off the court.  I don't follow other teams' role players' off court actions, the same way when people call Lowry a flopping crybaby Raptors fans don't talk about how he and his family serve meals to the less fortunate at thanksgiving.  To me, Beverley the player is a serviceable guard and positive defender, Beverley the human is the kind of guy who will play recklessly, injure someone and then be all ""wooooow why are all these people so salty at me I just play hard""."
"If AD &amp; Schroder come back 100%, it's theirs to lose, even with Brooklyn in the mix.  The Lakers have as many bodies as anyone to throw at KD &amp; Harden and the tools to expose &amp; punish the Nets weakness.  If any of Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan or Bruce Brown are seeing significant playing time as the Nets nominal 5, AD &amp; LeBron will eat them alive inside.  Without AD at 100% the Lakers don't have the firepower to compete and you could see them losing to Utah or the Clippers."
"Luckily Harden is easily the 2nd best floor raiser in the league. Look at how much better the role players are playing post Harden trade. No hate to any of these guys but a month ago would u really believe Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, and a 300 year old Jeff Green who looked like a shell of himself were gonna play important playoff and probably even finals minutes?"
"I honestly have him even with KD right now. Harden is making guys like Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Ty Johnson get so many open looks and they are cashing in."
Yeah that's dumb but I'm not sure the claim that Utah has the offensive firepower to match Brooklyn is a smart one either.  Nobody has Brooklyn's offensive firepower.  They have 3 of the 15 best scorers in the NBA on their team.  2 top 5 scorers.  They have a top 5 3 point shooter on their team.  Sure the fifth guy may be Jeff Green or Deandre which is less than ideal but as long as they stay out the way it shouldn't really matter.
"Nets have Mike D'Antoni and Harden, and these two have a much better team to work with now than what they had with the Rockets. They'll likely utilize a forced switch-iso situation on Gobert like with the Rockets, because Gobert cannot guard the perimeter and drawing him out nullifies his paint presence.   The Nets can also decide to go ""small"" and field Jeff Green and Durant at PF/C. They'll stretch the floor (again forcing Gobert to come out), but they don't actually give up a lot of height in the process.   Nets are the one team that I feel are perfectly designed to counter the Jazz defense."
"i think you mean 2018 cavs, even they had a good offense  korver jr smith jeff green klove could all shoot, just had trash defense"
"People focus so much on the Big 3 and seem to forget about Joe Harris (averaging 70% TS), Bruce Brown (one of the best wing defenders in the league, also putting up a 60%+ TS) and Jeff Green ( 64% TS, one of the most versatile and switchable bigs)."
My totally unbiased list:  Atlanta Hawks - Al Horfort  Boston Celtics - Bill Russell  Brooklyn Nets - Pierce  Charlotte Hornets - Kemba  Chicago Bulls - White Mamba  Cleveland Cavaliers - TT  Dallas Mavericks - Mavs legend Rajon Rondo  Denver Nuggets - Isaiah Thomas  Detroit Pistons - Billups  Golden State Warriors - Jonas Jerebko  Houston Rockets - Mchale  Indiana Pacers - Larry Legend  Los Angeles Clippers - Marcus Morris  Los Angeles Lakers - Shaq  Memphis Grizzlies - Tony Allen  Miami Heat - Kelly Olynyk  Milwaukee Bucks - Ray Allen  Minnesota Timberwolves - KG  New Orleans Pelicans - Jameer Nelson  New York Knicks - Nate Robinson  Oklahoma City Thunder - Perkins  Orlando Magic - Big Baby  Philadelphia 76ers - Fultz  Phoenix Suns - Aron Baynes  Portland Trail Blazers - Bill Walton  Sacramento Kings - Tiny  San Antonio Spurs - David Lee  Toronto Raptors - Jared Sullinger  Utah Jazz - Gordon Hayward  Washington Wizards - Jeff Green
"It’s not about total games played. Having a couple extra days off in early January cuz of COVID does not make playing so many games in Febuary any easier. And looking at Boston’s top 5 of Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, and Theis, every single one of them has had injury problems and have had to miss games. No team has had to consistently play without 2+ of their top 5 players (but different guys missing each time) all season. You also just ignore Boston’s lack of depth in general makes a more condensed schedule much harder on them than other teams. Boston has had guys like Javonte Green, Jeff Teague, Carsten Edwards, Semi, and Grant Williams start games this season. The Pacers haven’t had to stoop that low this season."
For real you have to be blind to think he's mocking Jeff Green here
"Regular season games in February cant really answer those questions. If you believe in Bruce Brown/Jeff Green, great. But many people wont and we wont really know who is right until the playoffs."
Bruce Brown dropping 27 yesterday I think answers the question of the Nets depth. He has really proved himself this year. Along with Jeff Green
"definitely some PTSD. Trust me, nothing is sweeter than looking at our current roster and record then doing the same with the Celtics. There's one player on our team that we actually drafted, the rest have come through free agency and trades. Basically got Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and TLC for free, picked up Jeff Green and Tyler Johnson for next to nothing, traded a G leagues and a second rounder for Bruce Brown, then of course signed Kyrie KD and Jordan and traded for Harden. Only semi-questionable move was trading a mid first for Shamet but he has turned it around lately and that's technically part of the Bruce Brown trade so it was a net positive.  Celtics on the other hand have had a million draft picks over the last 6 years and are under 500"
Just because he's out rn doses't mean you can exclude Jeff Green.
Jeff Green
"Force Harden to score. I know that sounds dumb for the scoring champion of the last few years, but it's a better gameplan than letting Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris get in a rhythm with scoring. I don't think any team has a chance when the ball is flying around and everyone is super hyped and full of energy. It's just human nature if you're getting involved on offense to play harder D and move around on offense, and when that happens it becomes all but impossible to stop that wave of momentum.   These guys are NBA players. If you're in the NBA, you can get hot and put up 30 if the opposing defense doesn't want to match your energy or really get in and guard you."
"Him and Jeff Green have become everything a team could ever want in role players. Between those two and Joe Harris we have some fire power for the playoffs. Once claxton gets his feeet under him too oh baby   I’m still not sure how we got him for what we did but hey, I’m not complaining."
"Real big 3 is Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and Jeff Green"
"&gt;Just like Kawhi?  Kawhi just wanted to play in LA, not in another country. It's a pure geographical reason as to why. I don't think Harden loved living in Brooklyn more than he did in Houston, so I doubt that's why he wanted to get traded  &gt;Jaylen Brown is likely to earn himself some All-NBA honors, starting this year.   Cool? Siakam was All NBA 2nd team last year, was he a superstar? Or anything close to it? Lmao  &gt;It also in no way would be a 1 for 1 Brown for Harden. The rumors were minimum Brown, Smart, bench players, and picks.   No, there were also rumors that you didn't need to throw in Smart too; the focal point was Brown and throwing in Kemba with some of your bad bench players (who aren't fucking helping you anyway, as most Celtics fans even admit) and picks (which you've miffed on for a while now) woulda been a better offer than Brookyln's. Just depends on if Ainge is willing to give up his war chest  &gt;So there's a future All-Star/All-NBA, a first team All-Defense, and then the picks you'd need to refill the bench you just traded away.   Still worth it, even if you gave up Brown. You're trying to tack on accolades to make it seem like you're giving up an insane amount but you're really not. DeAndre Jordan was 1st Team All NBA in 2016 or 17 I believe but he's nowhere near superstar level even in his peak.  &gt;Tatum and Harden cannot win the championship with role players.  Harden *alone* is capable of taking a bunch of bum role players to the 2nd round at least, and in the East that would be the Conference Finals, which has been your ceiling with the Jays. Do you fucking realize what he's doing with the corpse of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and other forgotten role players like Bruce Brown, TLC and Tyler Johnson?  Harden, Tatum, Smart, Tucker (assuming you added him as a solid vet rotational piece at the wing position who works well with Harden) and any Center who knows how to catch lobs is much better than you have now. It's also arguably better than the Nets pre Harden trade  &gt;Their primes are 5 years away. Everyone compares them to players who are 28+ when Brown is only 24.  Lmao, this is what's wrong with fanbases of this sub. Everyone says ""THEY'RE ONLY 24, THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR PRIME"" when defending their coveted young prospects as an excuse not to take the necessary risks to win when in reality being 24 means you're already in your prime.   This is about as good as Brown is going to be, especially considering his super hot shooting numbers are arguably statistically unsustainable and will continue to fall by the end of the year into the playoffs. That'll be the case pretty soon with Tatum. You need to realize you're in win now mode, and if you haven't made the Finals in the next couple years they'll want out  I get it; you're attached to your guys. Jaylen Brown is a stand up guy and great player. However, if your goal is to win a Championship, then you'll take the risks you have to in order to make it work."
"We don't have KD/TLC/Jeff Green so the rotations could be really funky. Also, I have more faith in us to beat top tier teams than I do below .500 teams. We are not nearly as good against worse teams"
"I'm not guaranteeing anything, still the lack of size is has the potential to be a major problem.  Nets need another big and for DeAndre Jordan to un-wash himself.  Embiid might average 45 against the Nets over a 7 game series if it's up to Jeff Green to slow him down."
Yeah Jeff green plays our center. That doesn’t mean he’s good at it but yeah he’s the center and Durant provides additional rim protection. Harden and Harris are good rebounders for their position. Obviously we’re always not gonna be good on the boards but works out because nobody can guard that lineup on offense
"they were getting eaten alive by the Clippers on the glass, regardless of where Brown plays/guards on defense it means the Nets are going to be small out there.  Who is protecting the rim on defense and getting rebounds?  Jeff Green? Bruce Brown? KD?"
There’s basically nobody for lebron to guard on the nets is the issue. He’s avoided guarding Durant and harden in the past. He can’t chase around joe Harris. He’s not guarding kyrie. I’d guess they put him on Jeff green and Davis on Durant. But that pulls all the rim protection away.
If you blitz these guys tho Harris or kyrie is gonna get an open jumper. Your best bet is to leave Jeff green open. He’s shooting 42% this year on 3s but that’s likely your best bet
"Not really. He averaged 25.7 points in that series which was just 1.2 points under his regular season average.   I still get what you mean though. You’re basically saying you need multiple all-defensive caliber big men to stop Giannis, basically like the Heat and Raptors. Who do the Nets have? Deandre Jordan? Jeff Green? The Nets are better than us and probably beat us but I guarantee you it won’t come at the hands of Giannis underperforming"
"That's flattop Jeff Green to you, Mister."
"When OKC drafted Durant, Jeff Green, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka in 3 straight years the team was called Thunder University by some members of the media because of their youth and inexperience.  Presti built that team, and he looks to be attempting to recreate a similar dynamic.   Hence: Thunder University."
"You can see which teams are switching a lot, harden is more getting switches to get off players like he was in Houston.   while OG, Ben, and Tate are more switched onto the teams best offensive player no matter who it is, showing how those guys are confident defenders from 1 to 5.  Haven't watched a lot of Tate though so maybe assuming, from his comparison to PJ Tucker I assume this is his role though.   Jeff Green is kinda getting the same run as harden, where the team is always switching harden because he can't get around a screen, so Green also has to switch.   Pretty sure this is just who defends the widest range of positions, not quality of defense."
It is very well because of it.  Their big rotation is basically a mix off Jeff Green DAJ Bruce Brown KD and Harden.  None of those is a true PF and only one true big man in Jordan.  Joe Harris and Harden have to guard bigs loads of time and get switched onto bigs.  If youre arguing its by design he guards bigs sure but the only reason is because their big men rotation is awful not because hes an insane defender down low or anything.
"Well in the context of basketball he’s a thug imo. Don’t get me wrong I’d love him on my team. But he’s not, he injured Jeff Green and he mocked him for it. Nice of you to use words so I could understand your take though."
"to tell you the truth, i see nothing wrong with what adams did in this instance and i saw nothing wrong with what bev did to jeff green. but this league has forced people into being soft. unfortunately there are players like james harden who feed off of it. shit sucks."
is it enough to offset injuring Jeff Green? stop pretending like the mock is the main issue lol
I like how former Celtics played a role in preventing them from making the Finals-Jeff Green in 2018 and Crowder/Olynyk in 2020.
"Why are you jumping to personal attacks when I brought up a neutral perspective, did he steal your lunch money or girl or something? his whole upper body shook when he re-enacted what he saw jeff green do, pat bev has mocked people in the past, you think it usually looks like this?"
"Always loved Jeff Green. Had high hopes for him when he came to Boston. Never reached his full potential (probably in part due to his heart surgery), but he was a good player and a good guy. Will always remember his big game against the Heat and his game winner off the cross court inbound in the corner"
The guy has missed most of the season with injuries and yet he’s trying to mark Jeff Green? Everyone remember when he was mocking the stadium workers last year? The guy is a piece of shit
"forever respect jeff green, being a celtics fan, that man puts a lot on the floor"
Fuck Pat Bev. That asshole injured Jeff Green on a bullshit dirty screen earlier this season that fucked his shoulder up.
Jeff Green
Ahh like when jeff green got injured and pat bev was making fun of him afterwards?
"&gt;Another observation is that he clearly is more inclined to not defer even when better options are on the floor  How do you people come on here and be so confident in being so wrong? This is so obviously fucking false if you watched one game. There are stretches where Kyrie just sits in a corner and doesn't do much because of how Harden plays. And he's been perfectly happy in that role, taking over when Harden goes to the bench  If Kyrie gets locked up, then he has KD, Harden, LMA, Blake, Joey, Jeff Green, and Shamet to pass it out to. We'll be fine"
Why the fuck is Jeff Green always on a minimum contract?
maybe? We'll see in the playoffs. Some of the Warriors teams underratedly had guys like Livingston that could score on their own without needing a creator. Not sure thats the case with Joe Harris and Jeff Green
"Hardens best teammate against the 2020 lakers was Jeff green and he still put up 30 and 8 on 65% TS. Lebron is better, but harden is capable"
You do realize LeBron’s best teammate in game 6 and 7 of the ECF was Jeff Green right?
"Jeff Weltman used to be Masai’s GM before Bobby,  I’m sure if they green lit it it’s not really tampering."
Jeff Green
Now find a clip of KD getting a dunk and Jeff Green being guarded. We all know the real MVP of this squad.
"All the teams you mentioned never had a chance to win in the first place. He took Jeff Green to the finals and got swept. He made the finals because the East was horrible when he played for the Cavs and 5 of the best 7 teams were in the West.  In 2018 the Warriors only swept one team, the Cavs, but no one wants to talk about that."
"Lebron took a team assembled at the deadline with Jeff green as the 2nd best player to the finals  He took 2 games off 67 win 2015 warriors with mozgov Thompson shumpert delladova  Their ORTG with him off the floor was 50.  KD basically has never had so little to work with, and while is a better scorer than lebron, lacks the elite level of playmaker to be a better floor raiser.  The only time I’d take KD over lebron is if I already have an elite primary ball handler who is bad off the the ball, because you would be wasting that players potential  But please don’t say that ‘lebron system’ doesn’t work because he’s taken dogshit teams to the finals as well as won chips with it and his drive and kick/elite finishing at the rim is probably the most efficient offense generated by 1 person for a whole team ever"
"There were some dumb takes but this level of fun is more than even I expected. Outside of the stars, guys like Joe Harris, Landry Shamet always keep the ball moving and fly off screens. Jeff Green just does everything and never forces it. Blake is a really good passer. Him and LMA bring some post up punch to the team. Claxton's a big ball of energy. Basically everything you'd want in an ideal offense. It's not just 3-4 guys standing around.   This is like D'Antoni's dream."
"Any team with harden would not have any issues with their offense.  Just have to fill the team with decent players like - Durant, Kyrie, Joe Harris, LMA, BG, Jeff Green, ..."
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
Crazy that Jeff Green is having the best season of his career in 13 years. I am curious what fans being back will do to some of these dudes that are shooting well above their normal averages.
U talking about the team whose second best player in the playoffs was george hill?  That 2018 cavs?? The one that needed a career jeff green game and 0/12 3 pt shooting from rozier to beat the celtics?
"No one thought they had enough assets to get Harden and they made the trade without giving up Kyrie/Harris. But even ignoring that trade, he added Jeff Green/LMA/Blake on cheap deals, made a great trade for Shamet/Brown, and resigned Harris who is having an exceptional year. And that's not mentioning the Nash/MDA additions which have worked out well."
Jeff Green
"You don’t think a team of Durant, Kyrie, Dinwiddie, Harris, Allen, DeAndre Jordan, LeVert, Jeff Green and Taurean Prince would have been competitive with the Lakers?"
replace jeff green with prime jordan. DO NETS GET BETTER OR WORSE!?!?!?!?
"They overachieved and hit a wall. I'm not asking you to list what they've done I'm asking you to look at the fucking roster beyond Brown and Tatum and most of these guys are hardly NBA level players currently. Why WOULD you expect them to make a run? Philly added guys like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard. Real experience and depth. Boston lost Hayward and added more rookies, the ghost of Jeff Teague, and a Covid ridden Thompson."
"What makes you say warriors KD is better than Brooklyn? KD, albeit in limited action, has been putting up some of the best numbers of his career. Avering 3 more points than he ever did on the dubs, shooting a career high % from 3 and doing everything extremely efficiently. His defensive ratings haven't really gone down either.   There's nothing suggesting that KD is worse now than he was other than the narrative that players are worse after getting hurt.   Also the difference is that after Klay and Dray, they had absolutely nothing off the bench, their next best player might've been ezeli. With Brooklyn, you have Kyrie, Harris, then you go to guys like Jeff Green, Blake, LMA, TLC, Shamet, and DJ who can all come in and give you an efficient 20 while playing high IQ, low mistake basketball.  That's the point of contention, a team that's historically top heavy usually doesn't have one of if not the best benches in the league, and probably shouldn't if you care at all about the idea of parity.   The Warriors had two guys who could go out and create their own offence, Brooklyn has 5-6. That alone is invaluable come playoff time when the game slows down and you rely on your halfcourt offence. You can argue that the sum of their parts was better in Golden State as we haven't seen this nets team over a full season yet, but in terms of pure talent, Brooklyn is clearly the most talented team ever in my eyes."
"I’m more of an effective field goal percentage kind of guy. It rewards more skillful and talented players than those who play for the refs whistle. Kyrie is doing much better in that category because he is a more skilled player. And I would hope a player who has the ball in his hands as much as harden would get at least double digits assists with guys like Kyrie, Joe Harris and Jeff Green shooting lights out this year."
Were the nets any good before getting jeff green? Jeff green &gt; kyrie irving
RJ might just become a better Jeff Green lol
i really wish Morey could have convo card Jeff Green to come here this offseason   not only would he not be on brooklyn but having an actual small 5 option would be so nice
"Also Jeff green was getting calls whenever he drove to the rim, I get they were scrambled from doubling Kyrie but some of those calls were fucking stupid. Oh well, at least rj had a hell of a game"
"Manu , crawford , nyk jr or Jeff green"
I feel like every team could use a Jeff Green
"What ? Those are our only two nba caiber players on the floor tn. Joey Harris got outplayed by bullock lol. TLC played 41 mins tn lmao. We played 3 g-league guys in tlc chiozza, and Alize. Then two second round picks in claxton and brown, then minimum player Jeff green. And you can see why Aldridge was bought out tn he was a non factor.   Y’all lost against a team missing 6 key rotation guys. You’re not a terrible team you’re a 500 team. You should’ve won this game"
Jeff green was the signing everyone should’ve had a meltdown over
We were playing good defense but man we had sent Jeff green to the line a little too much
"The reporter was clearly asking Bullock the other day about the Nets' Big 3 of Jeff Green, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, and Alize Johnson."
And jeff green
"Jeff Green looked pissed off all game lol, he was definently playing through some emotions"
Jeff Green is such a fucking good role player
I love you Jeff Green
Uncle Jeff Fucking Green
"Imagine you can’t double kyrie because of Jeff green, imagine when KD and Harden come back"
Nets Legend Jeff Green
WHAT A JOKE!!  They gave them more free throws.. This shit is so unfair it's absurd.  Bullock had ALL BALL on Jeff Green and they called a foul on that bs.
Uncle Jeff Fucking Green
Jeff green gonna get paid
Jeff Green really stepped up tonight
I hate Jeff Green.  So hard to tell what year he's gonna be good or trash.
"Isn't Shamet always bad in the playoffs? And Blake never plays in the playoffs and will need a miracle to get through 16+ games if they play the Lakers. LMA is nice but for him to start against AD + Gasol/Drummond would be tough on him, especially if he just went through a series of Adebayo/Giannis/Embiid. Their team is absolutely capable of going 16-0 in the playoffs if everyone played to their peak but those deep guys are all over performing when in the playoffs they won't even have the ball or the same type of minutes. I mean, I consistently see Jeff Green being relied upon when no team has ever had success relying on him."
So happy Jeff Green turned into a knock down 3pt guy. Been money all season
He's Jeff Green with a bad attitude.
The Sounds throwbacks that Vince Carter/Jeff Green-era GnG copped (2015-16?)
"Jeff Green has an underrated dunk reel, hell he's still adding to it"
Jeff Green. Dude comes out of nowhere with the poster/dunk
"I know the pundits are going to put this one on Kyrie saying they can’t win if the 3rd best is running the show, hopefully this doesn’t damage his mindset too much and turn him into hero ball mode   But IMHO, the reason they lost has less to do with Kyrie taking the lead and more so with Aldridge and Griffin getting 27 and 23 minutes, and being a -12 and -10 respectively.    When it was just Durant and/or just Harden, you had Green #3 in minutes per game in the NBA.  You had Brown playing a ton of minutes, and then Claxton getting 25+ minutes  This is important with the Nets switching defense and is especially important tonight because neither Aldridge or Griffin can switch.    Claxton getting 9 minutes and Jeff Green getting 25 against stretch 5 like Vucevic was just a bad coaching call.  Hopefully Nash watches the tape and remembers why no one wanted Griffin or LMA"
Jeff Green had heart surgery and remained a quality NBA player which is pretty cool
Nah cause Jeff Green reasons
'Me and jeff green are the same age and i cant do that'  Stacy king: but you can do it on 2k
"Nobody in the NBA as currently constructed has a chance against a fully healthy Nets team. Idk why we’re even pretending lmao.  Starting Kyrie-Harris-Harden-KD-Claxton(?) and THEN having Blake, LMA, Shamet, DJ, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, and Jeff Green coming off the bench is stupid deep and talented.   All of those guys listed on the bench are at MINIMUM above league average players."
He's just getting worse and worse. It's crazy to witness.  But I don't even know why Nash is going with these full line changes and a 10-man rotation...I guess it's because of the back-to-back but damn this is hard to watch.  Jeff Green is playing really apathetic today too for some reason.
"Dude it's 2021, everybody plays small in the playoffs, bigs get run off the floor all the time, you either have to be mobile and switchable on defense or you have to shoot 3s, and if you can't do at least one of those things, you're not playable in the playoffs. The Clippers are going to close games with Marcus Morris at the 5, the Nets close games with Jeff Green at the 5, the Suns close games with Saric at the 5, the Blazers close games with Melo at the 5 etc. that's just how teams play now to maximize offense.   The only 2 contending teams in the West who won't remove their center from closing time are the Jazz and Nuggets.   Guarantee you that when it comes playoff time, all 3 of Gasol, Drummond, and Harrell will see considerably less time on the court in favor of smaller lineups and more Markieff."
Did I miss something and Jeff Green became a hofer somewhere in his career?
"Alright so you would agree that a rotation of Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Chris Chiozza is bad?"
"Also before KD got hurt their big man rotation was DJ and Jeff Green, since KD got hurt, Claxton came back + they added Blake and LMA.   From the nets games I watched the difference between Claxton and Deandre has been massive.   Blake has been really solid for them too, LMA looked really good his first game."
"the irony is, they traded jeff green (didn’t want to pay him) for perkins, thinking they needed a big defensive 5 like perk to anchor their defense. when in reality, green would’ve been that swiss knife forward to be able to counter small ball lineups. then to make shit worse, they doubled down on giving up assets by paying him to re-sign. which had a ripple effect in how the harden negotiations went down, cause they were capped out and penny pinching on his deal. brooks has been a bad coach, even with good teams. durant, harden, russ literally carried him to the finals."
"I think when Scott Brooks took over as head coach in his second year he put KD at small forward and Jeff Green at power forward and ended the shooting guard experiment. I do remember KD taking some heat for not looking amazing at shooting guard, forgetting he was 19 or 20 and on a terrible team with PJ Carlesimo as head coach. I remember posters on RealGM claiming he was just going to be another Jamal Crawford at shooting guard!"
"Was at that game. Pain, but man LeBron was incredible. I couldn't believe it was Jeff Green (of all people, a former Celtic) murdering us too. Game was a total rock fight. Don't think either team hit 90 points, though I'm going off of memory on that part."
Jeff Green in a random playoff game
Jeff Green was their second best player when Love was healthy
Kevin Love (basically) didn’t play in game 6 and 7. Their second best player was Jeff Green lol
Get ready to see lots of Jeff Green
"K-Love, TT, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, old Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, young Ingram, young Randle, young Lonzo, young Kuzma, Rondo, and KCP... There are a lot of names there I would take over pretty much any of Steph’s current teammates apart from Draymond and maybe Wigs"
"LeBron with g-leaguers 😂😂  oh pls, they were way out of their league vs gsw, but the definition of g-leaguers is this warriors team. not george hill, kevin love, jr smith, jeff green, korver, clarkson. I’d kill to have ANY of them on our team over mfing Nico, Poole, JTA, Mulder, Wiseman, Oubrick."
"Remove two of the top 3 players from any team along with important rotation players like Looney. And tell me. What team in the nba would stand a chance?   Seriously imagine if Kawhi, Lowry and Gasol went down. They would have a starting lineup of Vanfleet, Norman Powell, Danny Green, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. That team would get obliterated in a finals game.   Though i do agree that warriors roster construction wasn’t great especially when guys like Jeff Green or Luc Mbah amoute are signing for the vet minimum"
"In my opinion, that has to be the greatest playoff run ever. I have never seen a collection of teammates seemingly conspire against their best player like that. I mean there is so much about that run already lost in history. George Hill, Clarkson, and Nance had straight up like complete dissociations with thousand yard stares all around. Rodney Hood had a nervous breakdown in the playoffs. TT had the whole kardashian drama that year and didn’t even play decent until the second round. Kevin Love got injured in the ECF. LeBron winning games with his next highest scorer being at like 12 pts. Scoring or assisting on nearly ever basket, etc. LeBron drug that Cavs squad kicking and screaming to the finals. There were games that Jeff Green and 36 yr old Korver were his 2nd and 3rd best players during that playoffs, and it wasn’t even their playmaking or shooting. They were just the only ones who looked like they cared on defense.   It’s funny now to see some of that squad’s careers play out. Like that playoffs forever has altered my opinion of Clarkson, George Hill, Hood, etc."
"They're not superstars. That's like saying Gary Payton on the 2006 Heat was a superstar. That's like saying Tracy Mcgrady on the 2013/14 Spurs was a superstar.  IF the nets go far in the playoffs (a big IF considering the Heat and Bucks are on par and them+76ers+possibly the celtics are all definitely better if KD is not 100%) then LMA and Blake will be far down the list of players who contribute the most to their success.  Here, I'll order it:  Tier 1: Harden, KD  Tier 2: Kyrie  Tier 3: Joe Harris, Jeff green, Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown  Tier 4: Landry Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nic Claxton, LMA, Blake  That means Blake and LMA will be somewhere between the 8th and 12th most valuable contributors in the postseason when that level of player usually gets 8 minutes a game.  Really? Have their not been enough changes to benefit small market teams?  Apparently it's impossible for small market teams to win. Only big market teams like the... San Antonio Spurs can win a title or 5.  You know, if a front office focuses on player development, asset management, coaching and infrastructure rather than whining to the league when the nets or lakers sign a guy to play 14 minutes per game in the postseason, (god forbid giving up a 2029 2nd rounder to take Drummond away from the Lakers buyout option) then they too could succeed rather than infringing on freedom of player movement.  Honestly, the small market crocodile tears are pathetic."
"Why does it have to be title teams?  Derek Fischer 2012.  Birdman 2013.  Boris Diaw 2012.  Joe Johnson 2016.  Enes Kanter 2019.  And in 2020 we have a ton of guys who made contributions including Marvin Williams, Jeff Green, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson."

"His 3 point shooting was a bit underwhelming but 20 PPG on 52 TS% as a 19 year old as the number 1 option with either Chris Wilcox or Jeff Green as your team’s second best player is pretty impressive.   Look at the shooting % of Anthony Edwards this year for example, and Edwards has better players surrounding him."
"Seems like Jeff Green always outperforms what you’d expect from a vet min player, but he just keeps signing one year better min contracts too"
"Idk if it's kendrick fucking perkins, you don't double a role player sharing the court with Kyrie, Joe Harris, and Jeff Green. Seriously it's never worth doubling a role player with much better teammates on the court unless he's the Michael Jordan of turning the ball over."
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"Great recognition, move, and pass by LMA, but I think the defense fell apart because of Biyombo. I get Biyombo wants to help and needs to keep an eye on the lane. However, he needs to commit to either doubling Aldridge (sensible because of the LMA on Hayward mismatch) or staying in drop coverage but with an eye on Jeff Green, but he gets caught in no man's land: he's not between LMA and the basket and he's really only kind of denying a passing lane to Kyrie. #25 does a good job picking up the cutter and denying the easy basket there. You can also see Rozier (#3) takes over guarding Kyrie, and he tells Biyombo that Jeff Green is now Biyombo's responsibility. #4 (Graham?) is kind of covering two people at once for a moment there but his man is Joe Harris in the corner, especially considering Harris is the more dangerous shooter. I think it's safe to say Rozier assumed Biyombo would close out on Jeff Green, but Biyombo kind of just stood there like a statue. Rozier wasn't great here either (hips completely turned in the wrong direction of the shooters on the floor), but Biyombo could have tightened up the lane better.  Also, people saying Griffin and LMA are washed are kind of right, but mostly wrong. Their athleticism is sapped by age, but the effect of high BBIQ and making the right play is multiplicative on offensive power. It only takes one weak guy on offense for the defense to find something to exploit (like Roberson or Tony Allen being left alone at the arc or with some players' inability to dribble without losing the ball), but when all five guys can pass, shoot, dribble, and make smart plays, the offense can go nuts. It's like how in baseball, if you just play a bunch of dudes who don't get out easily, that just magnifies the strengths of the lineup. Of course, their defense could be questionable, but we'll see if they turn it up in the playoffs because they have little incentive to go super hard (or even play, in some instances) during the regular season."
"So it’s looking like KD gets another easy ring and Kyrie gets one too. At least harden, bg, and Jeff green get one I guess"
"ah thanks, I always saw him as a rather calm type, but his physical build is the one of an enforcer or bullytype, glad im wrong, nothing bad against mr Green, just couldnt really figure him out /bow uncle Jeff"
"Jeff Green 12, Charlotte Hornets 11"
"As much as the Nets are easiest road shits for Harden, LMA, and Blake, you have to give them credit for pick ups like Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, and Jeff Green."
Jeff green on fire
"Literally been carrying scrubs, sorry Bruce brown and Jeff Green couldn’t get more touches"
"Taking Rozier 16 and Timelord 27 is nowhere near as good as taking Allen 22nd and Levert 20nd   You made good moves like thies, morris and IT, but you also made awful moves like sign Hayward, kyrie and kemba. The Nets didn't. We signed guys like Dinwiddie, Harris, Jeff Green and Tyler Johnson, all for minimums at the time. Shut the fuck up with ""the Celtics did everything right"". You didn't, and that's why you have a worse record than the Grizzlies and Hawks"
"I was too lmao. I watched LeBron defend Rose that entire 4th quarter game 6 of the ECF. But you gotta be delusional if you think the 2011 Miami Heat with 3 all-stars were the underdogs vs that Mavericks team. That’s like saying Steph Curry, KD, and Klay were the underdogs vs LeBron, Grant Hill, and Jeff Green in the 2018 Finals."
Tristan Thompson Jeff Teague Daniel Theis Javonte Green and semi ojeleye and 2 2nd round picks all for JJ . Or we could keep Thompson and Ojeleye and deal the rest of the players for Fournier Wagner and Kornet.  Ill take the younger guy who might sign with us for the future
"Harden, CP3, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and PJ Tucker.   Pretty damn decent"
"They might in regular season, but in playoffs one of them is probably going to be nailed to the bench, and neither one should ever be closing games. Jeff Green at center should still be this team's best option."
He’s already as good as Jeff Green. His ceiling is higher.
Rui’s already better than Jeff Green though.
James Harden makes people who weren't even on rosters look like fully viable rotation players. Also makes already viable rotation players (Uncle Jeff Green) look really good.   All the people that Harden has played with over the years and then got paid on a nicer than deserved contract over the years really owe him a cut of it ngl
"It wasn't even a stretch tbh. Ford and Givony had him that high. Besides, people knew that OKC was going to take fit not BPA. Seattle/OKC was already invested in Jeff Green, they weren't going to take Kevin Love. SEA/OKC was always going to take a guard at that spot. So the only question was whether they would take Bayless or Westbrook. But if you were paying attention in March and at the combine, that was never a choice. Rose and Curry were the only other guards besides Westbrook that were getting people talking (Curry didn't declare)."
"Harden was absolutely not considered a reach. He was a consensus top 5 pick. Most expected him to be top 3 or 4 depending on how high you were on Rubio. I remember because I was writing on realgm suggesting for the Raptors to trade up for him. Here's Chad Ford mocking him to go top 3/4.  https://www.espn.com/nba/draft2009/columns/story?columnist=ford_chad&amp;page=MockDraft-090519  Westbrook wasn't a reach either. He shot up during the predraft process. I remember people hyping up his physicals as being better than Rose. Going into the draft, he was a consensus top 5 pick. OKC already had Jeff Green who had a decent rookie season so nobody expected them to pick Kevin Love even though Love was the star on UCLA. The only other guards that were hyped was Bayless and Augustin but Westbrook's physicals and combine blew them away."
Unrelated but why is Jeff Green always on a minimum contract?
"You didn't mention Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Shumpert, and Joe Harris  for the Nets. You didn't mention Haslem or Chris Andersen for the Heat. Anyways, I'll"" go with Miami."
Jeff green has been doing that for us this year
"The only reason I'm not picking Nets out of the East is because of their defense.  Durant being one of their main helpside rim protectors might hurt down the stretch, especially if he picks up a couple fouls early.  Jeff Green and Bruce Brown have been helping them out doing the dirty work, but I'm really interested to see what the rotation is with Harden Kyrie and Durant all healthy."
WHY DOES JAMYCHAL GREEN LOOK EXACTLY LIKE JEFF GREEN FROM THIS ANGLE
"I mean, clax was better than any big on the lineup before Blake, unless you planned on running Jeff Green at the 5"
okc has a very short history  but if i tries it would be   1-westbrook  2- durant  3- ibaka  4-steven adams  5- nick collison  6- paul george  7- james harden  8- chris paul  9- thabo sefolosha  10- shai gilgeous alexander  11-kendrik perkins  12- jeff green  or somethingh like that
Because that's not the point of the post. AD is an allstar and can play just fine without LeBron. Jeff Green is less than sublime without Harden.
"To think the OKC Thunder once had James Harden, Kevin Durant and JEFF GREEN on the same team. Just imagine what could have been."

"I think they’d go Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Durant, Claxton. That being said I think it’s gonna change a lot depending on the games, they’ve got so much talent. Green can be relied upon in crunch time, so can Blake. Even guys like Shamet and TLC may be options down the stretch. The real question is who’s guarding Giannis?  As for Milwaukee, I think their final rotation’s gonna be Jrue, Donte, Khris , Giannis, Portis/ Lopez. I don’t think a guy like Tucker is worth using in that point in games because offensively, he just doesn’t offer nearly as much as Lopez or Portis. I honestly could see Portis getting the most minutes there because that front court would be giving Brooklyn fits, and he’s still relatively mobile. Forbes, Connaughton, and even Jeff Teague could get spot minutes as well.   Overall, i’m excited for this potential matchup, and narrative wise, I think this is Giannis’ best chance to really change how he’s viewed in the playoffs. He could absolutely dominate against Brooklyn, who’s guarding him? Durant? Durant is good defensively but he can’t body a guy like Giannis to the point where it’s a reliable matchup. If Giannis were to average like 35 12 and 6 on great shooting and beat Brooklyn, his bad playoff rep may go down the drain right then and there, unless he got shut down by Philly (Which is actually possible)."
"Agreed. And not only lottery, all were top 5 picks. Durant 2, Harden 3, and Westbrook 4. Really the only pick that deserves some credit is having the sense to go Harden over Tyreek Evans.  Durant was the obvious #2 after Oden.  In Russ' draft. Rose was the clear 1. I'll give them credit grabbing Russ over Love, Gallo and Eric Gordon although PG was the biggest need since they had just grabbed Durant, Jeff Green and had Collison and Thabo  In Harden's draft: Blake and Hasheem Thabeet were the clear 1 and 2. Here's where I'll give them credit for scouting Harden as the better player than Tyreek Evans.  So yeah, to say this was some insane level of scouting seems a bit much. It was more or less just not fucking up 3 back to back top 5 draft picks."
Shawn Marion is a comp I’ve been hearing lately.  Also reminds me of Jeff Green in a way.
I never know which team Jeff Green is on but  I know he’s on a team
I've said this for a few years now but it makes no sense that no team is giving Jeff Green more than 1 year minimums
I fucking love how 34 year old Jeff Green has been on a mission to catch as many bodies as possible this season
"Every single time I've seen Jeff Green play this season I find myself thinking ""huh, he looks better than I thought"". And every single time it happens to be James Harden making it happen."
Harden’s court vision is ridiculous. The way he has found Jeff Green all season has been incredible.
Harden reviving Jeff Green and Landry after weeks of them ghosting.
The Harden/Green connection is real.  He gets Uncle Jeff so many good looks
3rd year was a team option but it looks like the clippers picked it up for some reason and then traded him with a 1st for Jeff Green.  18 mil guaranteed in 2 years or 44 guaranteed in 5. I thought it was the right decision at the time too.
James Harden and Jeff Green  Nets fans and Rockets fans will understand
"I think that's revisionist history as well. In those days, it was a known fact that we were desperate for a legitimate center; you needed one in order to compete in that era's Western conference. We were starting players like Nenad Krstic and spamming #freecole hashtags because fans were convinced Cole Aldrich could be our center. Perkins brought us a legit center to go up with the Western juggernauts.   In addition, the players are on record as saying Perkins was a veteran leader for our young-as-hell team and helped turn them into the defensive powerhouse we were when we were contenders (people like to forget that the contending Thunder were a defensive team that relied on Russ/KD heroics to get by on offense). Serge Ibaka especially says that Perkins was a mentor to him and that he'd often call Perk in the middle of the night for advice and to vent frustrations.  Perkins gets hate because Scott Brooks insisted on playing him heavy minutes against a Miami Heat team that was way ahead of their time (playing a small ball 5 in Chris Bosh and loading up with shooters to support ball-dominate stars), but we wouldn't have gotten to that Finals without Perkins to bang with guys like Zach Randolph and the Gasol brothers.  People also like to complain about the Perkins trade and forget that all we really lost in that trade was Jeff Green (who was taking up minutes and preventing Serge Ibaka from developing) and Nenad Krstic."
"Do people think I am hating on Westbrook here? Also KD probably could in 2010 he carried a team to the playoffs, second best player was Jeff green.  I was giving Russ his props"
This sub doesn’t even mention how like a 21 year old KD carried OKC to 50+ wins in the bloodbath West in 2010 with Jeff Green as his 2nd best player.   You won’t find arguments that actually hold KD true to his value on this subreddit because they are mad KD will have more rings than their franchise. He spent most of 2010’s the 2nd best player in the league and it wasn’t even close aside from Curry’s 2016 season.
"Kevin Martin, Jeff Green, thabo sefolosa, royal ivey   Thats 4 over perkins but 3 are retired"
Jeff Green
Do you? This matchup reeks of Jeff Green syndrome - the idea of it is better than the reality.  It will be clear after one quarter what's gonna happen. Warriors get demolished and some late baskets will result in a not as close as it seems 10 point loss.
Its just nice seeing Durant and Jeff Green ball together again this year
Harrel has been deployed poorly in the playoffs by glen rivers. Jeff green is like 46 years old...
"Maybe they will. Kinda depends on where they’re drafted though. Are we still talking about Kawhi in the same way today if he wasn’t drafted to San Antonio?   If these guys are drafted to OKC, they’re likely to become superstars. That organization has produced Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Domas Sabonis, Jeff Green, Steven Adams, and now they’ve turned guys like Dort into productive NBA players. Their player development is off the charts.  If these guys are drafted to somewhere like Cleveland or Sacramento, chances are they’ll be squandered in a bad organization."
the one with jeff green
"Jeff green, better then harrel? That’s a lot much big dog."
"Having another star and basically minimum players is not stacked. Without all 3 stars their depth is really bad. They have to start guys like DeAndre Jordan who is washed up, minimum player Jeff Green, minimum player Bruce Brown, TLC, Tyler Johnson. Joe Harris is a great spot up shooter but his defense is terrible and can’t do much else. With only 2 Stars the Nets are not stacked at all"
"I don't think, at this point, that anyone questions who the best player in the world is. But MVP is a regular season award and we have to reward regular season effort and accomplishments with it. I know we all know he's the best but with all the plays and games he takes off, you just can't give it to Jeff Green every time."
"The Nets will still probably beat everyone and are obviously amazing but Blake is not playing like this even close to most nights, there's just no way. Also Kyrie Durant Harden and then 2021 Blake and Jeff Green is a hilarious sentence (not attacking you just found it a funny list lol)"
"Did anyone see the replay of the play that led to the last jump ball? It looked to me like jeff green just grabbed jokic's arms. I don't think there was a foul on that last shot, but if I saw the replay right I get why Jokic was pissed enough to get the T"

Jeff green mvp
Jeff green and Blake amazing today
Jeff Green swaps from trash to All Star from game to game and has those hidden All NBA 1st team level games. The ratio of good to bad games is also inconsistent like everything about Jeff Green
Jeff Green simply cant let a game happen without a poster attempt
Every few weeks Jeff Green reminds the league he's capable of murdering someone on a poster
Why does Jeff Green choose violence literally every time he drives?
Jeff Green finally got his dunk tonight.
Jeff Green on the Nets is the ultimate Jeff Green
I'd say Jeff Green from the Jazz was better. He was awful there and he turned into a major piece for us when he got here.
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
happened to Jeff Green once  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxnPQMhHW8o
"what were you saying when he brought a team of scrubs to the playoffs a few years back w gerald wallace, jeff green, etc.?"
Same thing with Lance Stephenson 2 years ago on Jeff Green
And Shamet and Jeff Green are literally a threat to go for 20+ any given game too with Harden feeding them. It puts a lot of pressure on the opposing team and helps free up Kyrie and KD to do amazing stuff.
"Jeff Green AKA Absolutely dat dude who crashes the boards hard, even on your airball."
You have Jeff Green. Powell isn't a bully ball player
"Jeff Green, 3-point Machine"
"Not as serious as Bjorkgren or Herro but KD supposedly complained about playing the four too much. Anecdotally, it does seem like he's playing with Jeff Green and a big more since he's returned from the hamstring."
"Every time I watch Jeff Green, I wonder how he gets the vet min every year"

"Let me follow on from this point. A lot of people's history of the Thunder goes like this: Young Promising Team - Harden traded - KD Leaves - Westbrook never gets out of the first round. The reality is so much more nuanced than that.   People fail to understand that the Thunder were ran to make a profit in the franchise's early years, OKC did not have a billionaire on board who could stomach financial losses. The billionaire came later in 2014/5 in the form of George B Kaiser. It is one of the reasons why the Thunder were so risk-tolerant in the Westbrook-PG era, they had the muscle to deal with losses.   You can debate whether the owners are right or wrong to run the team like this until you're blue in the face but the fact remains that the NBA retroactively applying the Rose Rule to Durant's extension hurt massively. The increased max meant that the Thunder would hit the repeater tax year after year if they chose to pay KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka. The Thunder could have amnestied Perkins but getting to the Finals required an elite interior defender who could match up with Duncan. It is not as cut and dry as it is made out to be.  Furthermore, the Harden trade was not solely about money. Money was a big factor but the Thunder held concerns about Harden's partying habits. Harden partying during the NBA Finals was not a good look and did not benefit the team against a tough, veteran Heat team. Moreover, Harden wanted a bigger role and this would have been unlikely in OKC. Harden would have hit RFA in 2013 and posed serious questions about the Thunder's ability to retain his services. It is still a stupid trade but you can understand some of the justification of the decision to trade Harden.  Post trade was an injury-ravaged spell. The 2013 team won 60 games and looked to be a better side that the year before. Patrick Beverley inexplicably ran into Russell's knee in the playoffs and that was a year gone. In 2014, Ibaka was injured against the Spurs and those fine margins make all of the difference. In 2015, KD suffers a Jones Fracture and OKC miss the playoffs entirely. 2016 was the only time that the Thunder were fully healthy and we saw what the Thunder were capable of.   The Thunder's failure to win a championship was pretty poor in the last decade but the team went to 3 Conference Finals, an NBA Finals and made the playoffs nine times. The reality is that the ceiling for small markets is lower than big markets. The Spurs are the only small market team in the last 20 years to win a championship.   When you look at all of these conditions, the Thunder were pretty successful.   I haven't even mentioned the failed Chandler trade in 2010 which would have changed the calculus for the Thunder. Tyson Chandler would have meant no Perk and Jeff Green staying.   OKC could have blown it up after Durant left, Presti did field calls for Russ and was close to a deal with the Celtics. The paperwork was filed with the league office but he got cold feet and worked on a max extension for Russell. That trade was something like Jae Crowder, Olynyk and the Celtics' pick in 2017. If that trade happened, the Thunder would have been in a painful rebuild.   The Thunder and Russ did the best with the hand they were dealt. He probably won't win a ring but that's life."
"I wouldn’t say that means hes bad but more that he may struggle with shifty ball handlers like CP3, role players usually have weaknesses or things that they’re not great at on both sides of the floor. A guy like PJ Tucker may be well suited to guard someone like CP3 due to his quickness and anticipation but he may struggle guarding guys like AD or Durant because of they’re ability to shoot over the top of him and thats a matchup where you may find much more success with a guy like RoCo. Players who can do it all are usually all nba level defenders like OG Anonouby   Also perimeter defense is much more complicated than just switching out onto ball handlers, being able to rotate properly and close out to the perimeter or just fly around in general is equally as valuable. And that’s something RoCo was elite at  Vertical spacing would be nice for sure but when RoCo is shoot 50% from 3 on 5.7 attempts a game i think all of that goes out the window lol, that’s added value to the offense that Capela could never provide  Gerald Green was an awful defender on the 2018 rockets, probably just as bad as Ben so its not like that team didn’t have its fair share of issues. Both him and Benny mac were on the floor because of their shooting ability   Did Jeff Green get cooked? I recall him actually being fairly solid while guarding DS and CP3   PJ was just as good on defense to me, getting older doesn’t guarantee you get worse"
"Ok ill take your word for it  That’s because PJ Tuckers shot attempts sky rocketed in 2020 and so naturally his efficiency numbers will drop off especially since the lobs to Capela are now spot up 3s in the corner for him. Still being able to shoot 37% from 3 in spite of this drastic change is actually kind of impressive   Id argue that Roco was a way better perimeter defender and still a capable presence at the rim, he was also a much more valuable offensive player for them. So he might not provide value in the exact same way as Capela, but he still provides significant value probably even more so than Capela overall. Especially considering that he can never be played off the floor  Im just not seeing how a supporting cast of EG, PJ, Green, Capela, Ariza and Moute( who only played 9 games out of 17 in the playoffs and averaged a measly 16.6 minutes per game while shooting 20% from 3) is all that much better than EG, Tucker, House, Covington, Mclemore, Rivers and Jeff Green   Those supporting players are equal at worst imo  Im sure rockets fans feel the 2018 supporting cast was substantially better but id argue Thats winning bias"
"The Clippers. The Hawks would be fun to watch with T-Mac, Stackhouse, Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Hinrich, Jeff Teague, Marvin Williams, Radmanovic, Erick Dampier, Zaza, and Willie Green."
"Were they? 2018 rockets had Gordon, Capela, Ariza, Tucker and Gerald Green as rotation players   2020 rockets had Benny mac, Rivers, Danuel House Jr, Robert Covington, Tucker, Gordon and Jeff Green as rotation players"
"yes, I agree, when you look at productivity and efficiency of guys like bruce brown, Nic claxton, jeff green and joe harris with harden running the offense its notably better.  Harden distorts the defense from the point, and finds these guys for easy shots.  Kyrie and KD score regardless of harden being on the floor, but even they are more efficient when harden runs the offense.  And opponents have to double harden, guys like Jrue Holiday do well against a smaller less physical Kyrie, but harden is a beast physically so holliday has his hands full, leaving a better mismatch for kyrie in that one case.  If harden doesnt come back healthy, I dont like the nets chances against the 76ers or Bucks.  You really want simmons and Jrue Holiday guarding harden, not kyrie.  this forces thybulle or others to guard Kyrie and I really like that matchup a lot better."
Robert Covington is a terrible rim protector and on ball presence his value is from his help defense. Jeff Green is meh and so is Trevor.  The only good defenders from that list that work in a traditional PF setting are Jae and Tobias.
"Lol, taking a lot of flack here for calling Deandre Jordan “good,” as though that’s high praise. Jeff Green is maybe better but I’ve also watched Jeff Green for long enough to know he can be really not good too. Blake is…pretty old and kind of healthy?   I’ve watched plenty of Nets games but not enough that I’d consider myself an expert. Don’t know a lot about Claxton besides what the stat sheet says. The only reason I called Jordan “good” was because he’s got more size than anyone else on the team and size = rebounds more often than not, which the Nets desperately need for the big 3 to be effective.  Anyway, I ain’t tryna pretend to be able to have an in-depth conversation about the efficacy of the Nets bench any more than you’d probably be able to do about my team. My initial point remains: outside of the Harden/Irving/Durant all staying healthy going into and during the playoffs, the Nets probably don’t make it past the second round, almost definitely don’t win the ECF.  Now folks pls quit blowing up my inbox I ain’t got more to say."
"The fuck? DeAndre Jordan??  You just exposed your lack of knowledge bud. Jeff Green, Claxton, and Blake are easily better."
"Here’s their likely playoff rotation:   1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Joe Harris  5. Jeff Green  6. Blake Griffin  7. Claxton  8. DJ  Reserves: Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Chiozza  That’s an all time great rotation."
Jeff green
"Having Harden changes our whole offense. Without Harden it’s pretty obvious that the bulk of the scoring is coming from KD, Kyrie then either Joe or Jeff Green. The thing with Joe is that he can’t or sometimes refuses to shoot if he has a guy glued to him. Having Harden back frees up guys like Joe, and other role players like a Clax, or a Bruce Brown to get easy looks. That makes it harder for the opposing teams to get stops. If you have the Big 3, Joe at the 3 point line and a big around the basket who are you gonna help off of?  In terms of defense, yes Harden isn’t a great defender. But I absolutely think his communication and IQ helps us big time. I just like how he keeps his team mates accountable."
"I think it was 2015. Warriors vs. Grizzlies. Round 2. They had Tony Allen and Zbo still. And I think Jeff Green and Courtney Lee were there. This was probably the last time we saw the Grit and Grind grizzlies playing at a high-ish level.  At this time people weren't really respecting the Warriors. The Grizzlies had a lead on the Warriors, 2-1 series lead. Chuck and all the old NBA heads were talking about how the Warriors wouldn't win cuz all they do is shoot jumpers whereas Grizzlies were an old school, grit and grind team.  Anywho...I don't remember when or how it happened, but the Grizzlies had a lead and it started slipping away. To me it was a bunch of ticky tack fouls (and yeah some nice jumpers from Klay and Steph). But you could see the Grizzlies started to get dejected. However it didn't feel like they were out of it.  It was the end of the half and Grizzlies inbounded the ball with some minor amount of time left. Jeff Green got it and someone was in front of him so he jumped into them to draw the foul (it was a foul) but the ref didn't call it.  The ball bounced to Steph...time ticking off the clock...and Steph patiently just chucked it from halfcourt and hit that bitch.  And that's when I knew it was over. Warriors won all the other games after that. Wasn't even close."
"I mean the only guys who can shoot on their roster are: Kyrie,Harden,KD,Jeff Green,Joe Harris and Blake. And a lot of these guys positions overlap so kinda hard to put up a lineup who can play 5 out. Also the big 3 has barely played together."
trash? joe harris is trash? blake is trash? jeff green is trash? bruce brown trash?
My gut says they'll trust Blake Griffin and Jeff Green as smallball 5s -- teams love to fall back on VETS! (good or bad) in the playoffs.
"I’m going to play devils advocate here (I don’t necessarily agree with it but just making a case and am interested to see how it plays out in the playoffs):  Yes the Nets didn’t have Harden but they scored 118 points on 84 shots yesterday. That’s 1.4 points per shot attempt. That’s absolutely absurd. Until the 4th quarter KD and Kyrie were making seemingly every shot, and they did quite a few open looks. KD did miss shots down the stretch but those were still open looks and both him and Kyrie shot over 50% from the floor and 50% from 3. How much better can they even get from there offensively even with Harden? Is 50%+ 3 point shooting sustainable?   Jeff Green is absolutely not a Giannis stopper but he’s a tall forward that at least forced Giannis to take a few fade away jumpers rather than getting to the rim. Giannis didn’t even shoot that efficiently yesterday. Adding James Harden would take away minutes from guys like Green, Griffin, Jordan and Brown who aren’t exactly defensive stalwarts by any means but they at least present some size that makes things a bit harder for Giannis.   What I’m getting to is that are there diminishing returns with Harden as they are already absolutely elite on offense and I think he’d certainly make the nets play smaller and make things even easier for the Bucks to score?"
You aren’t the only one.  Fuck patty mills  Fuck Jeff green  Fuck Terrence Ross  Fuck PJ Washington   And a lot of others.
&gt;	Rudy Gay/Jeff Green **hybrid**  Gay Green is a mid-tier strain.
"Claxton, Bruce Brown and honestly even Joe Harris all need Harden to come back. They are a noticeable step down without him. And Jeff Green is still good but but damn he really stretches teams when Harden is out there, their chemistry is fantastic.   People were claiming the Nets role players were elite and acting like Marks built the greatest depth in NBA history. Marks is great, I love him, and I like this team, but a lot of these players were getting elevated heavily by Harden. If we still had LMA that isn't even as important because that's a guy that can do it himself too, but without him it's really tough because Clax is obviously our best 5 and he badly needs Harden out there."
"&gt; Aside from the big 3 who on their team can they depend on to score enough to matter?  “Aside from two top 5 All-Time scorers and Kyrie, who can they depend on to score?”  You realize they have the #1 offense in the league with KD and Harden missing significant time right?   And honestly yes, there’s a real chance all 3 might average 30.  And to answer your question, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin"
"I love Jeff Green, dude is a soldier."
Jeff green selling
KD primarily generates offense for himself and occasionally creates shots for others.  Harden generates shots for other players first and foremost on this team and also can create his own shot.   Harden makes guys like Joe Harris and Jeff Green shine.
"Right, but people thought Jeff Green could be a 20+ guy and he’s just not. Just like Wiggins, they wanted him to be all-nba and 28+ but he isn’t that type... but at the end of it both guys are good, effective players that will have great careers."
The ole jeff green memorial award. The jeff green lifetime achievement award.
Jeff Green type beat
He’s better than Jeff green though.
"I think Wiggins is treated much more harshly than Jeff Green because he was a #1 pick. I don't think Wiggins is disappointing but more stuck on bad teams and was pressed into being a #1 scorer instead of being asked to be a competent 2-way. Maybe he should have figured it out himself, but Kerr has found his niche and while people still look at the Wiggs contract as a bad one, he's about as high end of a two way player you can get in the league right now (that isn't just untouchable), which is kind of ironic considering his Minny years."
"I feel rudy is more like a 6'9"" JR Smith than being like Jeff Green. Jeff and Wiggins are guys who are good band didn't live up to their potential but don't necessarily make bonehead plays. rudy and JR are the guys who will throw the ball out of bounds to nobody but then hit the game wiñner the next play, that's how I see them"
Rudy Gay/Jeff Green hybrid
Jeff green 2.0. A disappointment for most of his career until he's just accepted for what he is
It’s not a very good data point if it implies that Jeff Green is a better player than Giannis
"About to drop some knowledge on you from a different thread, please hold:  I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
Doug Christie is like younger Wesley Matthew’s   Olowakandi....well....it’s not the best news for him   Damon Stoudemire was a median level starting PG for a while basically   Derek Anderson had some Jeff Green in him hed trick you at times into thinking he was gonna reach another level. Looked the part
"So, Jeff Green is more valuable than James Harden with his ''decent D''. They dont have to run a same lineup every game dummy they can go big with benching Joe and starting Kyrie-Harden-Kd-Green-Jordan. And Its fucking James Harden he won and an mvp just with his offence you think he gonna give more points to Bucks than his own points. What a casual"

Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
He could play a similar role to Blake but prolly wouldn’t start over Jeff green in bk
Who tf is Jeff Green? Oh you mean NBA legend Jeff Green?
Jeff Green since he was a rookie
"Somehow had Isiah Thomas, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, and Jae Crowder, a weird fucking injured mix of malcontents.   Then trade them for Clarkson, Nance, George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jeff Green, who all promptly have their talents stolen by the Mon-Stars."
"Lol bring on Jeff Green or Joe Harris. They’re not bothering anyone. In fact I imagine we’ll be hunting both of them quite a bit on switches. KD and Claxton are the only two above average defenders in the nets regular rotation. The issue with the nets is they have 2-3 average to below average defenders on the floor at all times, the heat were able to hide Robinson and Herro because they rarely played together."
"Jeff Green sitting at 8/8 from three and getting a wide open, no one within five feet of him corner three in the closing minutes of the game because the guy defending him left him to half-heartedly double a driving KD was my breaking point. Doesn't matter that it was Green's first miss, just absolutely crushed any hope that this team can learn and change under Bud."
"I mean, yeah, KD can get his shot off versus pretty much anyone, but doubling him still bothers him significantly -- there's a reason why his playoff numbers on the Warriors (w/ all time spacing) were very good whereas his playoff numbers in OKC (w/ no spacing) were poor for what he put up in the regular season. Nets had some spacing (Jeff Green was scorching hot, you have to respect Harden/Joe Harris regardless of their shooting numbers) but you could still definitely try to rotate over.  As far as the shooting threat goes, most of the players you double are pretty big shooting threats, because they are very good players. You gotta stay disciplined in your rotations and prevent the pass back to Durant, sure, but it's better than letting him shoot over Tucker/Middleton or blow by Brook Lopez on the switch for the 10th time in a row.  Not taking anything from what KD did though -- man was possessed last night."
"He's too stubborn to adjust, the numbers say it's okay to give up those open 3s, but anyone with common sense would say oh shit Jeff green has his 4 swished 3s in a row we shouldn't leave him open. Or oh shit kd us cooking, lets double him.  I don't mean any insult but I genuinely wonder if he's on the spectrum. Or he has some narcissism disorder"
A superteam where Jeff Green is the 2nd option?
"My bet is the Sixers. That's now two straight games that they've choked away a big lead and this one was especially embarrassing. The Bucks were bad down the stretch of game 5, but were victims of a historic KD game and an out of body experience for Jeff Green (plus both teams haven't lost to the opponent at home all season, this series feels destined to go the full 7) and despite a poor second half, the Jazz hung in there versus a Clippers team that's still pretty strong even without Kawhi and I can easily see the pressure of trying to reach their first Conference Finals in history at home getting to the Clips."
"Ya it was a PG game, it’s like calling yesterday KD game the role player game cuz Jeff green has 27 and Blake has 17"
"If people knew Jeff Green, they would've known that was coming. Dude always has a random God mode game and is not heard from again until a series or 2 later."
"The suns are in the wcf, the bucks choked a 17 point lead while Jeff Green became Steph Curry, the sixers blew a 26 point lead against an atlanta team, and the clippers won game 5 without Kawhi. This is truely the dankest timeline."
"just get it to bojan ""jeff green"" bogdonovic"
Not to mention Jeff Green
Morris is pulling a Jeff Green tonight
It's not the posters fault that Jeff Green absorbed Joe Harris's powers and turn into Game 6 Klay Thompson. It was hard to see that coming.
Who the fuck does Marcus Morris think he is??….Jeff Green?!
The duality of Jeff Green
Also Jeff green numbers
Bogdanovic started 6-6 from three? Those are Jeff Green numbers
Jeff Green from the top rope!
"I know a lot of attention is on KD for his performance. But I kind of expected a huge game from him. Jeff Green having a career night was not what I was ready for, and does not get the attention it deserves."
"personally, home teams have won every game. i expect that to continue tomorrow, mainly because it would be hard for kd and jeff green to play as well as they did again. that being said, harris and harden wont shoot a combined 1 3pt tomorrow.   i am a wisconsin sports fan after all, so anything negative is possible."
Jeff green
I know this is the wrong thread but I'm still wrapping my head around Jeff Green hitting 7 straight 3s in a must win playoff game.
I mean you can do the exact same thing with last nights game.   KD and Jeff Green scored 76 points on 24-33 shooting. Rest of team scored 38 on 14-43 shooting
i never woulda thought there was another 3pt shooter as good as Jeff Green. but here Bogey is!
"Bojan ""Jeff Green wannabe"" Bogdanovic"
Should've swapped him for Jeff Green at the deadline
At least the hawks are healthy though. Bucks lost to KD and Jeff green.
Jeff Green mvp
Man embiid looking like Jeff Green out there
"Based on the fact their top 3 players are all healthy while the nets are basically kd, blake, jeff green and a quarter of harden"
"Game 3 was terrible basketball, but the Bucks played well for game 4 and just over half of game 5. If KD didn't heat up (plus Jeff Green going 7/8 from 3!?!), Bucks would have won game 5. Game 4, KD folded in the fourth. I still think it's the Bucks to lose due to health and injuries, but they need to pull their heads out of their asses. Right now, I think the Nets are going to live and die by KD having huge games."
I wonder how an Ish Smith/Wayne Ellington/Trevor Ariza/Thaddeus Young/Jeff Green team would do
"The nets winning the championship being carried by Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris while their big 3 are all injured would be pretty hilarious."
"I'm reminded of the luck aspect everytime I watch two teams that shoot a lot of threes (so basically every team) and one lives by it while the other one dies by it. You can creat open looks and collapses the defense, but if your 40+% shooters don't hit their open looks you'll lose, and stuff like that just happens. So much of it is luck, KD could have had 60 and they would still lose unless Jeff Green shows up."
Jeff Green 7/8 from 3. FYI.  But Kareem is right. MIL need to play to their strengths not whatever the hell they were doing last night.
Jeff Green scores 60 and goes 20/20 from deep
"what about game 2? No Harden, and the Bucks lost by 50. The nets were toying with them, if they kept the starters in it would've been a 70 point blowout. that's just embarrassing.      not to mention game 5 which wasn't just ""a total mess"", they blew their best chance to take control of the series in an extremely embarrassing and disappointing manner.      &gt; Part of what makes the Nets a superteam is that they have the luxury to afford to lose one or two key players and still be contenders.      Actually they don't have that luxury, because Harden and Kyrie are their only competent playmakers. well, KD is good too, but expecting him to be a full-time ball handler on top of everything he's been doing is too much. I doubt he'll be able to repeat that all-time great performance from last night.      there is NO REASON for Milwaukee to lose game 5. up 17 at halftime, nets role players (with the big exception of jeff green) are playing like trash, harden is at like 30% and can't defend the perimeter well, and so on and so on.      the bucks are amazing on paper but they just can't get it to work in game. they play like a pickup team. just random isos and terrible shots all-around. no mismatch abusing, no adjustments, nothing."
Imagine if KD goes out but Jeff Green carries them past the Bucks. The Dankest Timeline
This series now depends on harden.   I don’t see KD doing that again like he did last night that shit was just legendary. I don’t see Jeff green hitting every 3 he shoots either. If harden plays like he did last night I think bucks have a good chance of winning both but if he even comes back like 80% it’s over.   But imo it depends on Harden.
"Fairly reasonable? Ignoring Kyrie played in games 1-4, and Harden being back for the rest of the series.. Then proclaiming BG and Jeff Green as part of the ""big 3"" just to overinflate KD's value is weird. Just call it what it is, KD is the best player left in the playoffs."
"No we didn’t wtf are you talking about? Lol  Without harden and Kyrie, yes we are the better team. People just look at the final score and how many KD got but don’t realize he had an all time playoff game and Jeff green hitting so many 3s, neither will happen again.   From the most part bucks fans have been saying this since game 1 about not winning a chip with Bud, not sure how we are seen as “delusional”. But whatever gets you some upvotes though.  In fact before this series even started I believe it was this sub saying we had the best chance to beat a healthy Nets and win the title so if anything this sub is delusional."
"It entirely depends if we get the harden we got last night or if that was just rust.   KD isn’t gonna have that good of a game and Jeff Green sure as hell isn’t gonna be Steph curry. Also Blake isn’t gonna score almost 20 again more than likely.   So really it depends on Harden and how he plays. Idk if that was his hamstring still bothering him that’s what it looked like atleast, or if it was just him being rusty."
"It might not be Jeff Green next game but it could easily be someone like Joe Harris going off for 3, he's well past due"
Jeff Green scoring 7/8 from 3 was pretty important too. I don't think KD is going to get that level of support from him in game 6.
"The more I think about it- that was the worst performance by a coaching staff I’ve ever seen. Why not double KD. Make Harden beat you off one leg. Make Jeff Green beat you. I know he was killing it but if you lose to jeff green oh well.  They allowed the nets to play KD the whole game and Harden almost the entire game on one leg without attacking him and making him actually work on the defensive end. Make the nets switch and exploit the matchup. This is basketball 101. I have no idea what they were doing.   And then when they finally get Giannis being guarded by harden 6 feet from the basket, Giannis takes a 180 turn around fadeaway. Wtf.   The bucks are the team that really needed rondo last off season. Not because he’s capable of playing big minutes. But because he’s a fucking psycho that would kill you for playing like the bucks did last night."
The 2012 Thunder with Jeff Green at center instead of Perkins would have won.  (or even do green-ibaka as the 4-5)
The Bucks will still win this series. KD and Jeff Green aren't having career games again.
"Jokic is the only guy besides Kareem and Wilt to put up 30/20/10 in the playoffs. If Jeff Green doesn’t turn into Houston Josh Smith, KD loses this one as well."
I would be surprised if Harden didnt play at least mildly better. I dunno if KD can do what he did in back to back games or if Jeff Green will become MJ again though.
"Sure but the excuse is weak as hell when every other team is missing key guys on top of role players being injured. If everyone else was healthy then maybe it would matter but that's not the case. Th Bucks are the ONLY team left in the playoffs without an injury to a top 3 guy aside from the Hawks (who are missing 2 key role players).   Jazz: Conley out, Mitchell hobbled  Clippers: Kawhi out, Ibaka out for the playoffs  Suns: CP3 Covid?  Nets: Harden missed 4 games and is still injured, Kyrie inured, Jeff Green missed time, Dinwiddie injured, LMA retired.  Hawks: Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter are out 76ers: Embiid is playing injured.   It's pretty clear why Donte being out shouldn't matter considering they're supposed to be a contender and every other team is missing someone or has an injury to someone of more importance.   Lakers, Nuggets, and Celtics were missing their 2nd best player as well this playoffs. If you aren't missing a top 3 guy you have no excuse.   You don't see Clippers fans saying ""Ibaka is injured! He's very important to our team!"" Because it doesn't matter, if you have your top guys you have to get it done when EVERYONE is missing players."
jeff green is a goat role player tbf
"LMAO if missing him is the reason the Bucks can't win the Bucks never had a chance at winning in the first place. Especially when every other team is missing a top 3 guy or has an injury to a top guy.  Ibaka is out, Dinwiddle is out, Deandre Hunter is out, Will Barton missed time, Jeff Green missed time, etc."
"If you use his criteria, then Jeff Green also got snubbed."
Rest him and hope Jeff “Ray Allen Reggie Miller Steph Curry” Green shows up again.
"First team all-hospital:  CP3, Kyrie, Kawhi, AD, Embiid  Second team all-hospital:  Conley, Murray, Harden, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams  Honorable mentions: Kemba, Cam Reddish, Donte Divincenzo, Jeff Green, Jayson Tatum for like half of game 2"
"I mean let's be honest they won yesterday only because the bucks quite literally choked it away. KD had one of the best playoff games ever to just barely manage to win. Combined with Jeff Green going 7/8 from three. If bucks manage to find a brain they are going to absolutely defeat them for two games in a row. KD won't be able to pull a 48 min game at insane efficiency three games in a row. Unless Harden gets significantly better for game 6, it's bucks game to lose"
Meh losing Harden and Jeff Green gives you an advantage I’d say
Him or Jeff green. 100% let one of these Nets role players have to beat you. You live with that
Jeff Green slowly morphing into early 2000’s Robert Horry.
I think Jeff Green being a clear GOAT pod listener is the confirm here
No where did I say the bucks defensive scheme was good   My entire argument is the performance they put up wins most games.   The reason that performance didn’t work tonight is cause KD and Jeff Green had great games.
nah Jeff Green shot his load for the next 3 years last night
"I think this is a very interesting argument to keep Giannis off of KD for the majority of the game, but i dont think it excuses Giannis being off of him in crunch time. Maybe you keep Giannis off of him for the beginning of the game, but in the possessions that really matter where the teams are tied or separated by 1 or 2 points, you need a multi-year DPOY on the other team’s best player and you let a hobbled harden or jeff green try to beat you."
"&gt; I think the Bucks biggest issue is still whatever's going on with their offense right now.  Bingo. No one was stopping Durant last night and even with the Bucks laissez faire three point defense, I don't anticipate Jeff Green hitting 7 3s in a game too many more times, but the Bucks offense was a complete mess. It wasn't that they were missing shots that was most problematic, it was that I knew most of their possessions would end badly based on how they were developing."
"Jeff Green is like manna from heaven for contenders  He's positionally versatile, athletic, can shoot and will take a minimum contract to join your star-laden team and can contribute in the playoffs"
Jeff Green did miss a 3 last night.
"It took KD to have an all time performance and Jeff fucking Green to not miss a shot from 3 to beat us though. Both of those are very unlikely to happen again especially at the same time. Harden isn’t anywhere near 100% and isn’t going to be playing 45 minutes a game.   You can blame Giannis all you want and the Miami series last year I’ll agree with you somewhat but to not say Bud is the main issue is absolutely fucking stupid. We were ahead by 17, started to iso and that’s when the lead began to slip and Bud didn’t do a single thing to counter it."
"I don't get how Jeff Green can transform into prime LeBron for games/quarters, then be a meh roleplayer the next night, for this many years now"
"The bucks had a 17 point lead dude and literally let KD iso onto whoever he wanted. They shouldnt have been in that spot in the first place. If kyrie and harden were healthy I would completely understand, but the bucks have 0 reason to lose this series now. For fucks sake man they let jeff green drop 27 on them. Bud needs to go."
"Goddamn I wish I could have your optimism. I guess it is unlikely that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin go nuclear from 3 again, but the margins are so razor thing for the Bucks. Will Harden be as ineffective as he was this past game? I doubt it, so KD doesn't need to do as much.  I think it's less *that* the Bucks lost and more *how* they lost. When it came down to crunch time, the Bucks just looked lost. They panicked, didn't play any semblance of offense, couldn't figure out any way to slow KD down (though it's debatable that slowing KD was actually possible), and just looked like they had 0 BBIQ when the pressure ratcheted up. Nothing about that warrants optimism when you're faced with 2 must-win games"
Meanwhile Jeff Green who came to play with Conley on the Jazz was complete garbage and was barely playable as a 3rd stringer
"I think the momentum was firmly in Brooklyn’s favor at the point, but you’re right—that was an atrocious shot to take at the time.  Jeff Green/Blake in the 3rd quarter was what changed the game IMO."
&gt; To be fair if Jeff Green is 5/8 from 3 instead of 7/8 then that's all it takes for Bucks to pull out the win  And if Harden is 4/8 from 3 instead of 1/8 that's all it takes for this to be a blowout loss.
Yeah KD and Jeff Green really have cemented themselves as the best this generation has ever seen
KD is the superstar and had the game everyone expected.   We all knew he was getting at least 40 after the last game.     Who really beat the bucks was Jeff Green.   27 points on 7/8 3 points goal  Reg Season  11 ppg  4 rb   Post Season 6 ppg  3 rb  27 points in Game 5 in 34 minutes.   He took up the scoring slack.
"To be fair if Jeff Green is 5/8 from 3 instead of 7/8 then that's all it takes for Bucks to pull out the win, but yes, it was an embarrassing effort down the stretch"
"This was by far Bud's most inexcusable performance he's had. After all season of experimenting with adjustments and not riding and dying with the scheme I though there was maybe a chance in the playoffs he'd adjust.   But nope.   1) Harden played more than Giannis which is UNBELIEVABLE.   2) The team was making off-ball movement in the first half which made it exceptionally easy for the ball-handler to drive and dish. We completely went away from that in the second half. There was several possessions with Jrue, Giannis, and Middleton where they get the ball at the top of the key, NOBODY moved, and they waited until 5 seconds left on the shot clock to promptly throw up a contested shot.  3) Bud left Brook in the game while he was the reason for 5-6 open threes in a row while he hid in the paint. Bud went big, okay great, so we were at least abusing the only benefit of this and posting him up right? Wrong, Brook didn't get to post up his 6'8 center defender Jeff Green a single time.  4) Bud played ELIJAH FUCKING BRYANT in this game, who has played one NBA game before this playoffs, instead of Bobby Portis or even just Pat in the first half, this allowed the Nets to go on a solid little run when we were streaking in the first half.  5) And to top it all off, KD is going absolutely nuclear, best game of his career. Absolutely HUNTING Brook(who should've left the floor after the first 4 KD mid-ranges) and Pat(who tried his best but was too small) and Bud hides Giannis in the corner on Joe Harris. Doesn't double KD off of Harden who literally looked drunk out there.   I get a lot of people are saying ""Giannis can't fight around screens, KD would probably cook him"". Great, can we at LEAST FUCKING TRY IT. He's obviously cooking everybody else, and you have a DPOY AT LEAST SEE IF IT WORKS. We saw this exact case with Jimmy last year, Giannis never guarded him, he torches. Giannis demands to guard him a year later, absolutely locks him down. I'm not saying he would lock KD down, but that pattern has to make you think ""hey maybe this could work I'll give it a shot"".  For me this is peak Bucks disappointment. I barely came in with high expectations this year, with this current team I will never again expect us to win anything."
"This was very on par for playing vs. the Bucks though. Bud's scheme has a history of leaving role players wide open on the corner, and Jeff Green was absolutely abusing Brook's refusal to leave the paint. He's just another FVV or Tyler Herro to us. At a certain point when the same thing keeps happening, it's not a coincidence."
Joe Ingles vs Jeff Green as the marque matchup of the night between two backup versatile forwards suddenly thrusted into the limelight due to an unfortunate string of circumstances.  We’ll be back with more coverage of the NBA finals on tape delay stay tuned to ESPN 8: the Ocho.  Where if it’s almost basketball then it’s kinda a sport.
Oh shit! The other team played bad offense despite leading 17 at one point even though KD posted a 50 point triple double and a game winner with Jeff green as his second best player.
*revert to Jeff Green
"KD and Jeff Green had one of the best games in their entire career. Giannis played good but made some mistakes in the end, rest of the Bucks didn't really show up either."
I mean that’s certainly a reasonable take. Bucks could have won despite KD playing well and Jeff green going insane.
very true. also nets probably don't win without jeff green stepping up big time. extremely efficient game from him
"This is, IMO, the best take. We witnessed one of the greatest basketball players of all time to go god-mode in what was basically a do or die game - align with an old vet popping off.       Really unlikely we see Jeff Green go 7/8 from 3 and KD put up 50 with 48 minutes played for the next 2 games."
The Warriors were a great team on both sides. Check the stats for that postseason. They were the #1 defensive team. Strictly in defensive personnel the Bucks are better but the Warriors were so much smarter and also had all defensive players like Klay and Iggy. Bucks have better D but don't underestimate the Warriors. They're comparable.   But anyway that's not even their biggest strength like you said. They were also #1 in offense by far.   KD had to keep up with an offense that can't figure out how to get past a hobbled James Harden to attack a center rotation of Blake and Jeff Green. LeBron had to keep up with an all time great offense that included 2 MVPs in their prime flanked by a top 2 shooter of all time. And he had to go through the best defense of the playoffs too.   KD was unreal but that LeBron performance man. Just something else
Super star Jeff green is in the house lol
"Jeff Green probably won’t go 7/8 from 3, either."
"Look at the process for the bucks:  They didn’t know how to target harden defensively the entire game, in crunch time they give it to Giannis and he either does something stupid or gets fouled and misses free throws.   Your mistake is that your entire analysis is based on pretending the bucks are going to be in the exact same game in game 6.  They might not be up 22-9 in game 6. Sure, someone like Jeff green was hot but Joe Harris hasn’t made a shit for three games now. If he gets going, if harden is more useful, there are numerous scenarios where the nets can play a better game outside KD going forward. And all they need to do is win 1 of the next 2. What if the bucks have one of their games where they can’t hit a 3? It’s just ridiculous to ever treat a 3-2 deficit as not a big deal, specifically when the team down 3-2 massively blew game 5"
"I know he is bad at Free Throws but a foul and and two free shots is never the worst outcome. Even if he only makes one each time it's still a modest PPP and racks up fouls on the Nets dwindling bigs. Jeff Green finished with five fouls. I would think Giannis being aggressive and going to the line a lot, while maybe inefficient, would have other benefits like getting Green and Griffin on the bench."
Jeff Green should be Piccolo since he’s been doing it just as long as KD (Goku)
"Well damn, the premiere Finals matchup is gonna be Jae Crowder vs Jeff Green."
"The double was there if he drove.  Jeff Green was standing at the basket.  You don't need help defending him 8 feet out, and if he drives the defense looked ready to collapse."
"Hell no.  Game 6 is just as important for the team up 3-2 as it is for the one down in the series.  If you lose Game 6 you're just swinging momentum to the other side and rolling into a 50/50 toss up game 7.  Always close it out as quickly as possible.  I hate this idea even more because the Bucks should've actually won that game last night.  It took a collapse full of horrible basketball by the Bucks, *and* Durant playing the best game of his career, *and* Jeff Green shooting like Steph Curry from deep just to squeak that one out.  Harden isn't magically going to be way better by Game 7 - the Nets still have an uphill battle here, even if they're winning the series 3-2."
Jeff Green had/has strained plantar fascia. It’s amazing he can run and jump.
&gt; The Nets needed Durant to have a perfect game and play every single minute to barely beat the Bucks at home  They also needed Jeff Green to shoot 7-8 from 3. I bet in the next 2 games he shoots it like shit
Role players laying bricks?? Jeff green hasn’t been so wet since puberty
"KD had 49 so that's not a 50 point game. Can't round up to 50 lol.  I'm going to have to disagree with you. There was literally no pressure on KD to win that game. Sure, he had to play well to save face, but with Kyrie out and Harden hobbled nobody was expecting a Nets win. If Durant put up his normal statline, nobody would blame him for the loss.   The Blazers were down 20 in the second quarter and Dame went nuclear to bring them back. He hit a stepback 3 over Michael Porter with 4 seconds left in regulation to tie it up. Then we were down 9 in OT and Dame pulled it out, hitting a turnaround, fadeaway 3 with 6 seconds left.   Also, Jeff Green had 27 points on 11 FGA so it's not like everyone else on the Nets was trash."
I feel like he's going to have a Jeff Green-like breakout soon.
"Harden at 10%, Blake Griffin and Jeff Green &gt; KLove, TT, and JR Smith"
"Yes, because they are just taking shots away from Jeff Green at this point"
"he was a huge help in KD's 49 point game 5. He shot like 5/5 from the 3  he's a good role player that can get hot from the 3 and provides a strong body on defense. Also he has like 1 monster dunk almost every single game he plays  yea he's inconsistent but if he wasn't he'd be a star, Jeff Green is definitely worth more than a vet minimum"
"Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Jackson, Keif Morris"
Jeff Green!
"I remember when he was on the Jazz someone gave me a wonderful quote, ""The idea of Jeff Green is better than the actual Jeff Green""  He got bought out of the Jazz, revitalized his career as a small-ball 5 and instead of looking for a bigger bag he took another discount to play with KD and friends."
I never understood why Jeff Green never gets offered a better contract. Wasn't he on a vet min too back then with the Cavs and the Wizards?
"The reason for me making this post is because I thought of Jeff Green. Mans has been a great role player everywhere he goes - Cleveland, Houston, even Brooklyn! When is he gonna get a better deal?"
I’m biased but I genuinely believe it’s Jeff green
"Just gonna quote a comment of mine from the other day because I don’t wanna find it all again…  &gt; He put up 40/13/5 on 15/24 shooting in game 7 against the Nets, including 7 points on 3/4 in the fourth and one of the Bucks’ two made baskets in OT. Meanwhile the rest of the team shot 38% from the field with Middleton and Holiday combining for **14/49**.  &gt; He scored 31.2% of the team’s points in that series (to KD’s 33.8%), grabbed 23.6% of rebounds (to KD’s 24.4%) and created 19.8% of assists (to KD’s 25.1%), as well as being the team’s defensive anchor. And of course, he won. Despite KD’s best efforts, but it is worth noting for all the carrying he did the only game he won without Kyrie was when Jeff Green and Blake Griffin combined for 44 points on 15/26 shooting (so, the only time he got serious help).  We can look at the rosters on paper forever but in practice, a) KD had Kyrie for three and a half games and that’s where two of their three wins came from and b) Jrue couldn’t hit a layup all series and Middleton came right by the end but looked like total shit for half the series. Forbes and Portis played themselves out of the rotation and Lopez spent most of his time getting abused defensively.   For all our superiority on paper Giannis was the only guy who actually showed up with any consistency and the sheer volume of his contribution shows it pretty clearly."
"If everyone’s healthy the Nets also have Dinwiddie and Aldridge, and Jeff Green missed the first few games of the series too. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
Jeff Green too.  Dude keeps getting minimum contacts for some reason
or The Jeff Green Roller Coaster (with a higher floor)
Jae crowder and Jeff green are wayyy better than george hill or Trevor ariza
jeff green because all he keeps getting is a 1 year contract everywhere.
Jeff Green
"Jeff Green, Ariza, (old) Dwight Howard, George Hill are all in the same boat here   Every team loves the idea of having them, but they are obviously still ~low to mid tier role players. Which means no long term role and new interest from teams"
"He’s point guard Jeff Green. Every playoff contender seems to want him, but he rarely sticks around for more than a couple years these days."
"Jeff Green had a bigger game than any Jrue game in that series, Kyrie played 3 and a half games, Harden played in the other 4 games although hobbled. But I'll give you that KD probably would have won if roles were reversed, that doesn't prove anything tho besides KD and Giannis being similar level"
Funny thing is they tried to trade bench players to NO for Tyson Chandler in like 09 but he failed a physical so they traded Jeff green for perk like a year later.  could have swapped perk for Chandler and had old man Green coming off the bench.
"The Bucks are not deeper than the Nets. Outside of the big 3 Nets have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Claxton, and Bruce Brown. Bucks have Brook, Divencenzo, Tucker, Portis, Forbes, Teague, and Connaughton. The Nets were 1 shot away from going up 3-0 without harden playing at all. Its not to discredit the Bucks, I had them as the 2nd best team going into the playoffs but don't discredit the Nets for not having a deep team like the Bucks."
"The Nets don’t operate effectively with all (3) playing together. If so they sweep an empty Celtics team. Bucks likely win regardless, keep in mind with all (3) there’s virtually never going to be key offensive contributions from the bench and role players given they’re so ball dominant and they don’t seek out setting up teammates as a priority. Hence Joe Harris, Mike James, Bruce Brown, Shamet, and further a Jeff Green 27 points (7/8 from 3) in game 5 wouldn’t happen with all (3). Brown and Griffin were the only two who could exist off of lose balls and put backs. That team wasn’t setup for all 3 but did best with 2 stars. Don’t discount Harden as a facilitator in game 5 either. But as he looked more for his offense it hurt the team when he didn’t make or get to the line.   And for once understand that a team assembled of (3) health question marks is gonna be risky. Kyrie injury history is very lengthy, Harden was so out of shape to begin the year and never recovered. And they had a plan for Durant but had to sacrifice at the end of the regular season just keep the #2 seed due to Kyrie (8) game sabbatical, was great to him finish how he did."
"07-08 celtics trade for Allen beats it pretty easily.  Sczerbiak, West, and Jeff Green (technically 5th pick that became him) for Allen, which convinced KG that the Celtics were committed to winning so led to his trade.  Instant championship, a team that probably should have won the next year without KG getting hurt, another appearance and game 7 the year after, a 3-2 lead in the ECF against the Heatles in 2012.    So they got the same success in one year plus longer termed success."
"Jeff green isn’t neccesarily streaky , but on 3-5 random nights a year he becomes a top 5 player."
"This is the same team that barely lost to the best KD performance ever, only because Jeff Green shot like 90% from 3 and Bud made some questionable decisions.  The fact that we win anyway against competition that's not as good as KD even when they play their absolute best should surprise exactly no one."
The disrespect to Jeff Green.
Bucks path to their mickey mouse ring pop:  Heat with a 60 day offseason + Oladipo out  Nets missing Kyrie/Harden/Jeff Green. Stadium at 50% capacity  Hawks missing Trae Young and Deandre Hunter  Suns third best team in the west + CP3 playing through injury  10 all stars missed at least 1 game this postseason. New NBA record. Previous record was 6. Most unique starting lineups in a single postseason in NBA history  Win a real finals

i love how you added jeff green into that list. take my upvote
"Compared to facing Durant, Harden, Kyrie and Jeff Green yes it is"
"Please, everyone knew the Cavs were gonna be bad   Just go look at the thread of the initial announcement of Love getting this contract   Everyone knew it was a bad move but they were just paying him for the sake of it. Not a single person said anything close to ‘the Cavs are still trying to win games’. It was clear as day their time was over, having Kyle Korver, Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson isn’t a long term plan and if you or Love thought that, you are on the edge of delusional"
"This just proves my point even further, yes they had bad games but we still only won by 4 in OT because Khris and Jrue were shit aside from a few good plays in the 4th  KD did not take a game off us on his own, Jeff Green had like 22 pts and 6/7 from 3."
"We won 3 of 4 games when it was KD why are people acting like he dominated us? It took one of, if not the greatest playoff performances of his career to beat us and he still wouldn’t of had Jeff green not went 6/7 from 3.   Sick of the “KD almost beat y’all himself” when by himself he only won one game and had help, even in game 7 he had help Harden had 22, Griffin 17, Harris 10, brown 14."
"Pretty much. Even in 2k there’s no way you beat them, take out their starting 5 and the reserves are Dinwiddie (to be replaced by a ring chaser vet point guard next season), Bruce Brown, Claxton, Jeff Green, Shamet (who isn’t in the game for some reason), and we can just expect some ring chasers next season to be replacements and there’s no way they win if healthy."
"Wiseman is already looking like a potential bust. Wiggins is a high volume, low efficiency scorer that adds nothing to this team Draymond hasn't been Draymond for years. At this point of his career, he's more like a Myles Turner or Jeff Green level player A Steph-Wiggins-Klay backcourt is still way below average defensively.  One above average 3 and D wing doesn't turn a team who misses the playoffs into a Finals shoo-in"
"The current Pels franchise only includes 2002-2013 Hornets and 2013-present Pelicans, the Charlotte Hornets history was claimed by the current Charlotte team upon their inception and the Jazz history is part of the Utah Jazz franchise.  If you were curious, the Pels coaches are Paul Silas (black), Tim Floyd, Byron Scott (black), Jeff Bower, Monty Williams (black), Alvin Gentry (black), and SVG. If (when) Willie Green gets hired, he’ll have been the 8th HC, and 5th black one."
Yeah KD actually got doubled this year way more than this sub said he did  There's a reason why Jeff Green was like 8/9 from 3 in game 5(hint: not because he was taking contested shots)
"You’re acting like KD himself took us to 7 games by him self. Kyrie was there for 3 and half games. Had Jeff Green not hit 6/7 from 3 the series would’ve been over in 6 even with KD going off like he was.   Our run has been anything but a cakewalk, easier as far as the Nets series? Sure but it wasn’t a cakewalk series."
"Jeff Green and Joe Harris, who says no?"
Break out year for Jeff Green post-Big 3.    Rondo and Green will be the top duo in the league.    Jared Sullinger will be a star.    Delonte West is just as good as Devin Harris.    Glen Davis will have a breakout year similar to Rondo during the Big 3.    James Young will develop into a 6MOTY kind of player.    Jordan Crawford will be like Jamal Crawford.
That kind of implies Jeff Green would’ve commanded more than vet minimum anywhere else. He averaged 9 points in 19-20 and originally joined Houston on a 10-day contract. I don’t think there was a huge market for his services.
Jeff green was there from the beginning
"They’re gonna get a ton of ring chasing vets this summer and the deadline  We said that after the Harden trade and they got Blake, LMA and Jeff Green in 2 months"
"I need to see Middleton, PG, and Jeff Green on a team. If they all get hot at the same time that team is waxing the ‘96 Bulls"
We already have picks that year. 2045?…yeah. We have two firsts. I think we picked them up in the Jeff Green/Perk trade. /s
"Wizards got all the PG County boys let’s gooooooo. KD, Oladipo, Uncle Jeff Green, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Markelle Fultz, Quinn Cook, the list goes on."
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
Suns Celtics. Jeff Green was on the C's and IT and Dragic were on the suns
If he had Jeff Green going 7/7 for 3 he might
"Jeff Green. You never know what he'll do, but it sure ain't gonna be pretty."
Jeff Green over Gerald bold take
Jeff Green
"Len is so ass that Jeff Green needs to be C. With that being said, probably a conference finals/finals berth. I don’t think it’s championship worthy, but it’s very good. 2 all stars, a fringe all star, and 2 good starters IMO."
"Combo forwards went from a con to a pro as the game modernized. Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, Rudy Gay, etc became more relevant players."
"During the Snyder era, we've only run a 5 out lineup on two occasions.   The first was with Boris Diaw at the 5 in 2017. I don't remember how those lineups performed, but I do recall liking them because we surrounded Diaw with skilled wings (Johnson, Ingles, Hayward, Hood), which made us very versatile. The downside was that there was no rim protection or rebounding on the floor.  The second time the Jazz ran a 5 out lineup was when Jeff Green played for us last season. Snyder only brought that lineup out on a few occasions. I remember the offense looking pretty good, but the defense was awful. Much of that was because Jeff Green was awful for us, even in small ball situations."
"Harden was out the first 4 games, and played with a grade 2 hamstring tear the next 3.  Kyrie played 3 and a half games (all without Harden) and then got injured and missed the rest.  Jeff Green was also injured IIRC.  The Bucks were getting blown out by 30 with just KD and Kyrie. They played the last 3 games of the series with basically just KD.  Can we please not revise the entire playoffs like this. It literally happened like a month ago"
"Yeah, casually pretend Kyrie and Harden werent injured all series lol.  The Nets roster outside those 3 is ass.  Hell, even Jeff Green was injured"
"Hes in that sweet spot where hes good (or *was* good) so he gets paid alot (leaving you open to criticism), and has bounced around teams so that no one fanbase will ever stick up for him.  Similar to like jeff teague (before he became a really bad player) or Jeff Green before he became a vet min type guy  Those types of guys are often scapegoated"
The 2022 Nets are going to end up like Mr. Burn's ringer team.    James Harden: Arrested for narcotics in France  Kevin Durant: Hypnotized into believing he's a snake  Kyrie Irving: Fell off the edge of the earth  Blake Griffin: Gets into a car accident while filming a KIA commercial  Joe Harris: Refuses to shave his pubes and gets kicked off the team  DeAndre Jordan: Gets dwarfism eating a special brain and nerve pizza developed by team doctors  Jeff Green: Too buy rescuing people during a hurricane  Spencer Dinwiddie: Knocked out by local oaf over argument about who's the real NY team
"Wouldn’t the Nets have Jarrett Allen in this case? I feel like a healthy team of Kyrie, Caris Levert, Joe Harris, KD, and Jarrett Allen (or put Bruce brown as PG and let Levert play 6th man) would be able to take it, even have a guy like Jeff Green who wouldn’t have to play as major of a role on defense if Allen was there.  Dunno, i guess i might still take the Cavs in that series but it’s a little closer than i thought."
"I think a lot of my worries for him is that his ability did not get better as the season went along. He peaked in his first two games, and then progressively got worse as the season went along, and had a lot kid trouble generating easy shots off the dribble, at the rim or anywhere else. He does have a lot of Jeff green on him, and also a more above the rim josh Jackson, both good ball handlers"
"Agreed there.   He has a good handle, and his ability to attack the basket got better but he still gets tunnel vision on offence.   Definitely one of the more “project” players in the draft. With his frame and athleticism though he can be a guy that ends up playing a 12-15 year career though while being underwhelming for most of it, or he could be a star.   The guy has the Jeff Green mould all over him."
"If you can get outplayed by someone like Jeff Green, than yes you're only worth the vet minimum."
"Yea they really weren’t crazy trades at the time. Twolves in particular got a bunch of what we’re considered at the time really promising players. Like it didn’t work out but Big AL and Gerald green were considered to be like near top of their class prospects.  Telefair was still pretty young. I was a huge Ryan Gomes fan when he was in college, like he was good. Tweeners like him are really coveted today. Plus 2 1sts, I forgot who they drafted. Maybe one of them was Randy Foye? Also considered like a can’t miss prospect. Just didn’t work out. Rashad McCants maybe, really can’t remember how those picks shook out.   Thunder got Delonte West and Jeff Green. Both at the time considered can’t miss players. Both memes now but Green was seen as like a future point forward with range and defensive potential. Delonte West was a monster.   Didn’t work out but these were better trades than people would understand today. Took Celtics a long ass time and a lot of luck to have that many quality young assets."
"I know. I’m just saying how insane it is that anyone at the time thought that trades centered around Kevin Garnett for Al Jefferson/picks, or Ray Allen for Wally Szczerbiak/Jeff Green, were in any way more balanced than Pau Gasol for Marc Gasol/picks. But that 100% happened."
with Jeff Green and Al Jefferson
"As a Nets fan, the Bucks are the dumbest team you'll ever see play basketball IQ-wise. They didn't punish Bruce Brown/Blake Griffin/Jeff Green at center down low the whole series, the Suns will be fine"
"The Nets are going to have signed 3 former all-nba PF's, and Jeff Green will continue to be their best option at the position.  Jokes aside, if Love does end up there, yikes to the NBA. We can talk about how they'll never be healthy, but I don't want to have to actively root for injuries just for a competitive championship."
Jeff green is a better comp to loss of production than any of those others. Donte is like pretty good thats all
"Why does that matter? Even if it did, Hunter is the best defender on the list  Also forgot to mention Jeff green in that list"
"Nate Robinson along with Kendrick Perkins were traded for Jeff Green, so they would not be on the same team."
You're right with Jeff Green we wouldnt have havw had a chance!!!
"I wouldn't say Chandler was better than Ibaka, like Chandler barely beat Ibaka in 2011-12 for DPOY. The Thunder were just trading spare parts for Chandler and we would have still have Ibaka and Jeff Green.  So the main core for those early thunder teams would have been:  PG: Russ SG: Thabo/Harden SF: KD PF: Ibaka/Green C: Chandler/Collison  Dallas also wouldn't have had Chandler, so we would have gone to the finals a year earlier than we did."
"Nash did pretty well considering the big 3 hardly played together this season. He got a lot out of their role players - Bruce Brown, Claxton, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, and even Mike James looked pretty good.   And yea Stevens maybe lost the locker room a bit and maybe that's why he's stepping down so maybe he wasn't a great example."
"Kareem said this before the Nets series and in it Kyrie and Harden got hurt, and Jeff Green was also playing hurt so he couldn't have predicted it"
Ik I was mainly talking about 2017 as well tho even without Paul the Warriors managed to win 2 straight. I would take the 2018 Rockets without Paul over the Nets without Kyrie AND a hobbled Harden and Jeff Green
Jeff Green signed with the Nets because he knew Harden was going to end up there. Convince me otherwise.
"&gt; Drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 ahead of Harden, Curry, DeRozan.  It's been widely reported that the Grizzlies owner at the time demanded Thabeet to be the pick.   &gt; Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night.  Would still do that trade 10/10 times. The PF starting spot went to Zach Randolph. Would not even want to think of the Grizzlies without Zach Randolph, plus Kevin Love would have demanded a trade eventually like he did in Minny.  &gt; Signing Chandler Parsons to a max contract.  It was either that or Evan Turner and Chandler Parsons was deemed the better prospect. If we didn't sign Chandler Parsons, Mike Conley was ready to sign with Dallas.   &gt; Trading the farm for 1 season of Jeff Green.  Trade a protected first for a player that we thought at the time could take the aging Grit N Grind team over the hump. Ended up being the #14 pick. Playoff teams take that risk all of the time.  &gt; Sitting but not trading Tyreke Evans while he was averaging 20/5/5 on a team that was tanking.  We had lowball offers, the Celtics wanted two seconds for him. I don't blame him for waiting until the last second to see if a playoff team flinches and offers a first. I am not losing sleep not having the two late 2nds."
"Plausable behind the scenes possibilities on these takes:    Heisley insisted on taking Thabeet.      Conley pushed for acquiring Parsons as the missing piece, when we were looking to get him to re-sign.    Jeff Green was considered the missing piece that you take a home run swing on with that roster.    Tyreke was literally smoking crack when he returned to Memphis, and the trade would require disclosures that made no one look good."
"We had open looks in games 4-7,just that the role players missed most of them,with the exception of Jeff Green in G4.People gave crap to the Bucks coaching staff for not doubling KD,but they did try for a while in G5 and Jeff Green cooked them.Even though Harris and Harden couldn't hit anything they were still too scary to leave open constantly"
"I mean, yeah. ringless guys are going to be begging to play with them. Guys like jeff green can be had on minimum deals. As long as the big three stay healthy, they'll be fine. I mean, they were on their way to embarrassing the bucks in five with just durant and irving."
Rudy Gay and Jeff Green are both names that have been thrown around due to their connections with Udoka
Nets about to get some Houston firsts for Jeff Green
"I really don't know how this guy continues to get a job in scouting of all departments lol.  Here are a list of examples that made absolutely no sense:      The Grizzlies shipped out a first-rounder, Tayshaun Prince and Quincy Pondexter for Jeff Green, Russ Smith and a 2015 second-rounder.      Drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 ahead of Harden, Curry, DeRozan.      Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night in a 8 player trade.      Signed Parsons to that god awful max contract.      Sitting a 20/5/5/ Tyreke Evans on a team that wasn't good, in which he also defended his stance on the team slowly picking it back up, even if they weren't tanking.      **Draft results:**      2007: Mike Conley      2008: Love for Mayo swap      2008: Donte Greene      2009: Hasheem Thabeet      2009: DeMarre Carroll      2010: Xavier Henry      2010: Dominique Jones      2010: Greivis Vasquez      2012: Tony Wroten      2014: Jordan Adams      2015: Jarrell Martin      2016: Wade Baldwin IV      2018: Jaren Jackson Jr.      Looking pretty pretty bad.... So he hit on like what, 2-3 picks?"
"Some examples of Chris Wallace's talent evaluation include:   Drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 ahead of Harden, Curry, DeRozan.   Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night.   Signing Chandler Parsons to a max contract.  Trading the farm for 1 season of Jeff Green.  Sitting but not trading Tyreke Evans while he was averaging 20/5/5 on a team that was tanking."
Bruce Brown also lost his mind at the end of game 3 and Jeff Green was injured for half of the series as well.
Shit was unreal. I don't think I've ever seen a better individual run. Even Iverson had some good defense behind him for the Finals run...that Cavs team had....Jeff Green..?
Forgot about all of the help Lebron had in Jeff Green
"&gt; Also saying role players have no structure with Lebron is just completely wrong. Players in Lebron led teams have defined roles from the moment they’re signed to the roster. Lebron isn’t just calling an iso every play he’s callings actual plays &amp; uses the PnR etc.  This hasn’t been true since he left Miami.  &gt; Role players don’t need to dribble to score, there’s absolutely no reason for Kuzma or KCP to ever initiate the offense when LeBron is on the court.  1) They don’t have to initiate it, they just need to be involved in a more meaningful way. Jeff Green and Rodney Hood don’t need to run the offense but they need the occasional touch and some actions.   2) It would probably help Lebron a lot as he ages if he let the offense work for him more instead of trying to just drive past everybody like he used to. They did it a little with Schroeder this year but I think that’s cause Schroeder is pretty useless off-ball."
Ah yes trae young and 2018 lebron with their elite second options of bogdanavic and jeff green.
1 Jeff Green  2  Kawhi  3 Dirk? 4. Paul Millsap 5 Super TT 6 Jimmy Butler with a jumper  7 Harden.    Looking at upside.
"Role players need structure. They’re not good enough to consistently ad-lib their way into buckets. You have to involve them in the game to get value out of them.   Lebron, for all his ability to find open teammates, doesn’t involve them enough because the offense is almost always him and one other player taking turns ISO’ing and just telling everyone else where to stand.  Jeff Green is great when you use him in the PnR or let him be a passing swing point. Houston discovered this immediately and he’s been an awesome partner for Harden. If all you do is have him stand and wait for a 3, he’s not very good.   Same with Clarkson, Hill and Hood. They need to be involved with the ball.  There’s some exceptions, with great shooters, but even then you’re almost always running actions for them and involving them that way.   Crowder is the rare guy that all you want him to do is wait in the corner and play D.  TL;DR: Lebron’s role players consistently underperform because his teams don’t have offensive systems and rotational guys really need consistency. People weirdly recognized this with D’Antoni’s Rockets but have ignored it with Bron’s teams."
I watched that whole 2018 season lol. All guys who seem to be pretty good now were absolute shit with the Cavs. D Rose looked cooked. Clarkson was unbelievably bad. Jae couldn’t shoot a rock into an ocean on a boat. Whole team was just not good. Only Jeff Green was ok.
"I think Khris's performances cancel out with Jeff Green, Kyrie, and Blake Griffin's performances throughout the series. That leaves Jrue as the one real advantage the Bucks had, and he was nowhere to be found. That's why I believe the playing field was still even in a Giannis v Durant perspective."
Or Jeff Green.
"People who say this haven’t watched Jeff green for long… he showed out at the end of the year but there is a 13 year sample size that has lead to him being the journeyman he is at this point. And that’s fine, he’s pretty good at what he does. But it certainly wasn’t criminal that he was on a minimum this year."
This is the Nets w/o Harden and Kyrie healthy right? How can you say this years Nets were all time great when Jeff Green was their 2nd best player. Idk I feel like the 60 win 2011 Bulls squad w/ MVP Rose is pretty close to the 2019 Raps.
Ya that reminded me of the Jeff Green game in Bucks Nets where Green was like 7/8 from 3 and then didn’t make a 3 the rest of the series.  Let’s not get too reactionary over an unsustainable 3 point game. He looked good on defense though consistently.
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.  Suns: Prime CP3, Booker, Ayton, Crowder, Bridges, 76ers Saric, Hornets Kaminsky, Pelicans E'Twaun Moore.  Warriors: Steph, Klay, Draymond, T-Wolves Wiggins, Hawks Bazemore, Wizards Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee, Paschall.  Heat: Jimmy, Iggy, Oladipo, Dragic, Bam, Ariza, Haslem, Herro, Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Bjelica.  Blazers: Lillard, Melo, CJ, Nurkic, Covington, Kanter, Norman Powell, Hollis-Jefferson.  Bucks: Giannis, Lopez, Holiday, Middleton, Teague, Portis, Tucker, Forbes.  Knicks: MVP Rose, Randle, Barrett, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel, Pistons Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks, Quickley."
Jeff Green on a min is criminal
It's insurance in case Jeff Green or Blake get a decent offer elsewhere
Prime Jeff Green.
"Jeff Green is like one of those facebook memes where you pick a superpower and someone picks a downfall. Jeff Green picked ""Greatest bball player ever"" and someone picked ""only during a full moon."""
Always forget jeff green was on that team. He still randomly can go off sometimes lol
"Exactly, people act like LeBron did it on his own and manhandled Toronto (obviously was amazing that series) but these were his teammates' averages for the series.

"I feel like a very very good role player could possibly do this. If you told me PJ Tucker of Jeff Green were close to this, I’d believe you"
"They traded for Jeff Green in 2011 and he's in the video, it's def not 2008"
The year we tanked with Jeff Green.   Our draft selection after that year? Marcus Smart.
"The bucks played KD 1v1 even though his teammates were down. According to holiday they were not help defending and if the net got to beat them KD should score 60 and he nearly did.    We all knew KD is an elite scorer but that serie highlighted his great passing. In the second half of game 5 when he wasn't missing the bucks decided to double him and he found the open man everytime and that led to that Jeff green monster performance.they returned to playing him 1v1 afterwards.  I think a lot of credit should be given to Jeff green . Bruce brown and Blake Griffin, nobody was expecting that of them but they stepped up big and outplayed the bucks starters outside of Giannis khris offensively.   The analyst were hyping up the bucks because that what they always do against great teams. So many teams were supposed to be a great challenge to the Heatles. The nets are a better team Top down against the bucks . better starters and better bench even without this year's addition."
"Kd was creating shots for Teammates all series. He literally averaged 9 assists the last 4 games of the series. Why do you think Jeff green had 28 points? And Kd to Bruce brown in game 3 almost won theme the game with those short roll passers. I think you’re looking at the result, and framing a narrative based on the result. That’s like saying if lebron is such a good playmaker, why didn’t he make his players shoot better than 30% against the suns? If Jokic is such a good playmaker why did the Nuggets shoot poorly against the suns? No, they were just outmatched, same as Durant.   What Kd did vs the bucks is prime lebron level tbh. If he had kyrie they win the East"
"Nets: Jeff Green  Hawks: Gallinari  Bucks: Overall, either Portis or Pat.  Suns: Bridges  Clippers: Jackson"
"&gt; KD was the Nets only offensive threat.  Jeff Green had 27 in the one game y'all won without Kyrie lmao. Not to mention a guy like Joe Harris who was trash still has to be guarded cos he was the best 3 point shooter in the fucking league in the regular season  &gt; If that were true he would have been on him rather than worrying about help defense on their scrubs and role players.  Anyone can score in the paint and Giannis helps stop that, which is why he's the best help defender in the league.   &gt; He made that block because he's a freak athlete  Yeah a freak athlete with lateral quickness, hence him being a freak athlete. He literally wouldn't have been able to pull that off without lateral quickness he guarded Booker and then shuffled over to Ayton and got up to block him. But you said in another comment that Giannis can be guarded 1on1 so I was probably right in saying the Nets series was your first time watching him, you clearly weren't even watching basketball the last few years"
"“Alone”  He had Kyries help for 2 of those wins lol the series would have been over in 5 games if it was KD. We beat KD 3-1. Game 5s win wasn’t just because of KD either, if it was for Jeff Green over performing from 3 that game would have been a blowout."
"I’m not saying KD didn’t play amazing because he did, even as a bucks fan it was amazing/infuriating to watch. But he had two amazing games, game 5 and game 7 but Giannis also had an amazing game 7.   One thing that bothers me is people only wanna give KD credit for game 5 when Jeff Green had an amazing performance also and without that KD still would have lost and it likely would have been a blowout if he didn’t perform so well."
Lol my favorite excuse people use is “but KD almost beat Giannis by himself” when like you said he was 1-3 by himself. If Jeff green didn’t over perform he would have been 0-4 by himself
they signed Jeff Green so probably
He'd be a good Jeff Green replacement. Idk how to pay him tho so 🤷‍♂️.
"No? LeBron has four titles, was he only the best player on the floor for four years? Was MJ only the best for six years? Was Paul Pierce better than Kobe in 08?  Middleton and Jrue shot a combined **14/49** in that game 7. Meanwhile the only game KD won without Kyrie was when Jeff Green scored 27 points on 11 shots. If being the best player on the floor is enough and KD’s better than Giannis why’d he lose three of four without Kyrie? Don’t tell me about disingenuous."
They played KD 1v1 and dared him to beat them and he nearly did.  I still think they respected his teammates too much or maybe I'm wrong because when they decided to let Jeff green open he killed them in game 5
"Oh nice, you found an example of KD taking two dribbles to the right and pulling up for a jumper, that looks really hard to stay in front of lol   How about this example where Giannis can't stay in front of him?  https://streamable.com/tuj6ex  Why did they hide Giannis on Jeff Green all series if he can cover KD, thats the real question."
Can you give me evidence of him being exceptionally dirty? Only incident I can think of is the Jeff Green thing
Lmao can’t wait for Bucks fans to come back down to earth. Guy said since Jeff Green had 27 one game it was a legitimate win. The Nets are far and away a better team and so are the Lakers
&gt;After Kyrie went down the Nets won one game when Jeff Green had 27 so I don't see how that qualifies as KD almost dragging a weak team anywhere.  Come on.
"&gt; Losing to Durant+Jeff Green was seen as an awful loss. You guys weren't the underdogs after the injuries.  Yeah, can’t imagine why I keep going on about Jeff Green (mentioned him once). You certainly never brought him up obviously.  Indeed, KD’s game 5 was the best game either player had in that series. They still would have lost had Green not had by far the best shooting performance of his entire career. It was also not the best game either player had for the whole playoffs, because Finals game 6 Giannis happened. Nor does one game make a series, if it did that’d mean Green performed better than anybody on the Bucks not named Giannis or Middleton and you’re *clearly* not making that argument.  You’ve also still completely failed to explain how this was seen as an “awful loss” when the spread was one point, nor did you at any point tie that back to which of KD and Giannis was better because you didn’t mention anything about Giannis’ individual performance in that game or any other. Are you actually high or just dumb?"
"Yes I think 538 is much less reliable than bookies who are trying to make money off the odds lines they give out and have incentive to ensure they don't make the likely winner an underdog and give that team better odds.  I honestly have no idea why you keep going on about Jeff Green. Durant was 16-23 for 49 points and was involved in creating for himself, others, acting as a decoy and playing great defense. That's why people rate him as the best after the series loss because while watching the damn game you could tell how well he was dominating it."
You think 538 is a) *less* reliable than bookies and b) not taking injuries into account when giving the Nets a 55% chance at home in game 5? Like that’d totally be all they get if fully healthy? Yeah alright.  Even with your own link our “awful loss against KD and Jeff Green” was in a game where the spread was **1 point** and Green scored 27 points on 11 shots. That’s an awful loss? What are you on.
"Jeff Green only has 1 good game consumable every season, you can't count that."
"Defenses don’t change their schemes when a good player like Holiday has a rough series. They’ll give him the same attention no matter what. Same with Jeff Green. He can go 10-13 one game, but he’s only impacting 10 possessions because the defense isn’t going to sacrifice help on KD to cover him. They will, however, guard Holiday on every possession because the odds will even out.  Giannis, in the playoffs, is a top 4 player in the league (too close to rank) and he’s way closer to 1 than he is 5. I just think too many people are looking at the results instead of the process."
583/976 games Jeff Green has started 59% isn’t consistent imo.
This may be the best description of Jeff Green imaginable
&gt;	1 Player who hasn't made an All Star team in the 4 years  De’aaron Fox   &gt;	1 Player who currently doesn't average more than 11 PPG  Draymond Green   &gt;	1 Player who has never played a series that went to 7 games  Anthony Davis   &gt;	1 Player who has never been a consistent starter  Jeff Green    Fox / BI / Jeff Green / Draymond / AD
What did he lead them to? His costar Kyrie got hurt and then they won a single game when Jeff Green had 27. That's the bar for proving you're the best in the league?
After Kyrie went down the Nets won one game when Jeff Green had 27 so I don't see how that qualifies as KD almost dragging a weak team anywhere.
Bucks were being mocked for losing/not dominating the nets after the Kyrie injury. Losing to Durant+Jeff Green was seen as an awful loss. You guys weren't the underdogs after the injuries.
"Jrue had some okay games offensively, Khris had 1-2 great games offensively. You know who else had a great game offensively? Jeff fucking Green, like 27 points on 10-13 shooting. Don’t pretend the Bucks supporting cast were anything close to stellar that series, for a good part of it they were actually pretty terrible, pretty much outside of Middleton’s 38 pointer and 35 pointer.   And again you’re just diminishing Giannis’ buckets for no reason. He got to the rim and scored. You do realize that Bud got destroyed for never doubling KD all series long, right?  For the most part we had Tucker’s 6’5 ass going one-on-one. Did you even watch?   Again, I’m NOT claiming Giannis was better that series. All I’m saying is he was very fucking good, and his supporting cast collapsed outside of Middleton for a couple games.    This is a take that is true by the numbers, is true by the eye test, and is true everywhere but in the minds of people like you who can’t possibly grasp that two players can be all-time greats in a single series. It’s sad really."
Imagine playing Shawn kemp and drexler in the finals LMAO  What fake GOAT only makes 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history  Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than jordan does vs literal PE teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec
"It's still a first, and the lakers won't be in the bottom 10. You gave away another first too but luckily that's also lottery protected since you probably won't make the playoffs. I can't imagine thinking these are good moves. When we traded first round picks for Jon Leuer and Jeff Green I didn't defend it lmao and we were actually in the playoffs then."
Both. It’s not like he had anyone else aside from Jeff Green and Blake offensively and Harden to sometimes facilitate for 2 games. Your defense should suffer dramatically when you’re taking the offensive workload on top of longer minutes but KD’s didn’t.
Imagine making 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history   There wouldn’t be a Jordan era if even Durant played in the 90s  Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals and a million times better performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did by pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec
"Jeff Green, Gerald Green, Shannon Brown, James White JR Smith - HOF basketball athleticism"
"People hang on to the scalabrine thing too much. When I lived in Maryland my friend’s parents often took me to Cole Field House to watch organized pick up games with the UMD basketball team, sort of a mini pro-am thing going on. The skill level would range from Georgetown and other local d1 university players, overseas players, and NBA regulars such as Michael Beasley, Jeff Green, Steve Francis, Ty Lawson and KD even made the rare appearance. The first time I ever watched one of these games Cliff Tucker (RIP) must have gone like 90% from the field and torched Juan dixon, Mike Beasley and Ty Lawson who were NBA players on the other team.  The only NBA player on Tucker’s team was Steve Blake. After that game I was so convinced Tucker was going to be an NBA star I sought out his autograph cuz I thought it’d be worth something in the future. Long story short - I’m convinced a top 5ish college team will win at least 1 game in an nba season."
"I can't find the clip anymore but I'll never forget when KG said he thought Jeff Green had all the tools to be one the GOATs and a reporter asked Green about it and he let out the saddest little ""did he really say that?"" as if he couldn't care less. That's when I knew it was over for him."
"Jeff Green being out for an entire season for open heart surgery on an aortic aneurysm and then coming back and playing 10+ more seasons is like HOF resilience and HOF love of the game, in my opinion. Part of the reason he spent so many years getting one-year minimum contracts is that nobody believed he'd come back from that and still be able to contribute for so many years."
"&gt;You can get a better return for Harden.  We asked for Klay and Beal lmfao.  &gt;You can get a more playable than Kanter for a first round pick  Where was this energy when our Adams/Kanter line up help us beat the 67 win Spurs? Or when it helped us go up 3-1 vs the 73 win Warriors. I'll just answer for you bro. It was non-existent.   &gt;You can get a better player than Waiter for another first round pick (maybe not I actually liked Dion)  He played really well for us though?  &gt;You can get a better return for Jeff Green/Not extend Kendrick Perkins before seeing he's not the same than before the injury)  We got Kendrick Perkins so we can contend with the best team in the West at the time, the Lakers. You can't put Jeff Green on Bynum or Pau. Jeff Green would have been unplayable.  &gt;You can have a good coach that's actually gonna let Jeremy Lamb develop instead of playing a washed up Caron Butler in front of him  You just came at us for not getting better role players and then we got one in Caron ... but now you're saying we should have developed Lamb over Caron. Lamb got better as his FGA went up because he needed that for his development. You can't have guys like Russ/KD on your team and worry about giving Lamb more shots.  I'll agree with the coaching.  &gt;Or a coach that could actually play Ibaka at center in the match up when it's needed unlike Scottie Brooks.  I wish this happened but this was pretty unheard of before 2016. He played 16% of minutes at center with us (2016 being his last year). The league started to change with switchability. His % jumped to 56% at center post 2016."
"You can get a better return for Harden.

I see  Still doesn't change the fact we didn't play against Blake.  Neither against Jeff Green.
How? The Nets were killing the Bucks the first two games and still went to 7 with KD’s 2nd best teammate was Jeff Green. You just can’t comprehend
"Jeff Green - Sometimes looking like he has all the tools to be a star (athleticism, built, shooting, playmaking) while sometimes looking like he learned how to dribble four hours ago."
Reminds me of how Doc would sign players that busted the Clippers up like Josh Smith and Jeff Green (who they traded a frp for lmao)
"Collins has been getting a lot of hate, but it was his first playoffs and the teams Atlanta played all had good to great veterans at the PF rotation.  He was a young guy going against Blake Griffin, Giannis, Bobby Portis, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, and Julius Randle. That would be a tough gauntlet for any PF's first playoff run."
"Jeremy Lin, JR Smith, Nick Young, Jeff Green, Andre Drummond and a bench of whoever I can find  It will be called the team of heat checks surely we will get one game where all those guys turn into prime Michael Jordan and we win in a 200 point blowout.   If we get another blazing hot game just feed tge ball to Drummond in the post and led him take care of it"
I understand the rest but Jeff Green? Not even close to his prime
"Patty already has a ring and is a career 38% 3PT shooter come playoff time. Losing Jeff Green was a loss, but Patty shouldn’t be overlooked as Kyrie insurance"
"Dude, Patty Mills doesn't make this team that much better than they were before. If anything losing Jeff Green is worse for them because he was basically a small stretch five and could switch onto multiple positions. Patty Mills is 6-1 and will get hunted on defense in a playoff series."
Much respect to Jeff Green for taking it in stride and not complaining or moaning which would have sorta ruined one of the greatest bench mob clips lol
"Absolutely, guys with playmaking, handles, decent touch, decent shooting, and solid athleticism are definitely high ceiling.    Also (not saying this will happen), plenty of high ceiling guys do not become stars: Brandon Jennings, Tyreek Evans, Jeff Green, Gerald Wallace   Wallace and Green had high ceilings for different reasons then stated above, but they had the physical tools to be star Forwards."
Imagine if he was drafted one year after Russ and Russ was drafted first.   This twat honestly thinks his chips mean anything.   Goddamn Jeff Green could have signed with the warriors that season and won a chip. Fucking delusional.
"They went 73-9 and Steph had to choke for them to lose in the finals   With the Rocky relationship in cleveland they were 1000% title favorites with Danny Green, Gerald Green, or Jeff Green at SF"
"KAT  KP  Jokic (maybe)  Thats the list. Everyone else is really a 4 moonlighting as a five (ala Jeff Green or Bobby Portis) or isnt being guarded out on the perimeter enough to justify the moniker ""Stretch 5"" (Embiid, Vuc, Lopez)"
"After game 7 where nobody could score in OT and Gianni's demanded the ball to score over KD in the post, The Greek freak said that KD is the best player in the world.   It is honestly the only time I Remember someone recognising their opponent after a win and it speaks to how much KD is respected.   Honestly KD has been the best 1v1 player since like 2012. Kobe said he is the only player in his career he couldn't figure out. No matter what you do KD is gonna get his.   Jrue said that their game plan was to clamp everyone else and let KD beat  them if he is gonna score 60. And he nearly did.  In game 5 he score every difficult shot and whenever they sent help he punished the bucks with his passing and that led to that Jeff green monster performance.    Looking back at some of the OKC teams I wonder If they had more success if KD stopped playing basketball the ""right way"" and just significantly upped his usage rate."
"KD does defend lebron   They do put Jeff green on SFs  And not everyone guards PG or Kawhi well, they are in the top 1% of players   One of the kings guards would come off the bench as it's going to be matchup dependent, not sure what you're going on about"
Yeah cus KD and Jeff Green could defend LeBron and Paul George or Kawhi. Mitchell and Haliburton are traffic cones for star SFs
He injured Jeff Green and then mocked him. Fuck off Pat Bev's burner.
"Come on man, he had a messed up quad and had recently recovered from COVID. The only reason why he played at all in that series was because the Rockets could not get it done against the Thunder despite the likes of Jeff Green going off."
Watched both it’s not even close   Lebron has a million times better finals performances vs million times better competition   More 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Jordan played in the weakest era in nba history   Also he wouldn’t even sniff the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 cavs teams lebron took to the finals   Talking about in the modern era not the expansion era where Jordan made the playoffs going 30-52  There wouldn’t even be a Jordan era if Durant played in the 90s
"LOL. His shot release was literally noticeably weird because he was shooting off one leg, that’s how bad he was. He put up 22/9/9 on one fucking leg, if he was healthy they get destroyed. You’re hilarious claiming an injured player is healthy. Literally just watch him the series before against Boston where he put up 28/8/11 on 76% ts  Yes he absolutely is on one leg. Jeff green missed 4 games"
"You do realize that youtube exists right?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ3BuTSsOrU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ3BuTSsOrU)  You gonna watch this and tell me that James Harden is out there limping around? Decoys don't take 17 shots, he just sucked. His defense looked just as bad as it does when he is playing 100% though.  Also Jeff Green played for 12mins in game 7."
"Lmao nobody gives a fuck about donte, 2 superstars didn’t play. If you want to talk about role players, Jeff green didn’t play.  And lmao wow. Thanks for telling me you didn’t watch the series at all. You’re on crack if you think harden was “fine”. He was literally limping around the court unable to drive or do anything, literally just there as a decoy. He was refusing fast breaks and anything that involved sprinting. There’s a reason he missed 4 games. Miss me with that bullshit. Bucks got bailed out. Harden + Kyrie destroy them"
Jeff Green went back during the summers to get his Georgetown degree after he left for the NBA.
We already have Jeff green and jamychal green too
Don't forget they already have JaMychal and Jeff Green now to add to the fun
"A name people often bring up is Dwight Howard. Despite all his accolade his game remained limited, and he failed to reach the potential many people expected. Others argue his achievements throughout his career prove he in fact reached that potential.  Others I had in mind: Jeff Green, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Jennings, Michael Beasley, Rondo, Derrick Williams, and I always though Eric Bledsoe would be better"
"Jesus Christ this is the worst comment I’ve ever seen  You start of by comparing donte to harden and Irving.. nice. Not to mention Jeff green getting hurt.  &gt; you have no idea what harden would have done  *what*?? On one leg in games 6 and 7 the bucks barely won and harden was playing 50+ mins and contributing. If he was healthy they absolutely get shitted on lmfao. Harden was the best player on the team before going down, gtfo with that"
Nets didn’t have Spencer dinwiddie or Jeff green. Not sure what your point is.
Jeff green
I'll play along because I too am bored.  Bold players are my starting 5.  **PG Stephen Curry (2009; All-Star)**  **SG James Harden (2009; All-Star)**  **SF Kawhi Leonard (2011; All-Star)**  **PF Kevin Durant (2007; All-Star)**  **C Nikola Jokic (2014; All-Star)**  PG Chris Paul (2005; All-Star)  SG Klay Thompson (2011; All-Star)  PF Anthony Davis (2012; All-Star)  C Joel Embiid (2014; All-Star)  PG/SG Jamal Murray (2016)  PG Ja Morant (2019)  SF Jeff Green (2007)  C Clint Capela (2014)  SG J.J.

"Nets get an A- for bringing in Patty Mills(awesome addition) and James Johnson, while losing Jeff Green and not addressing any defensive concerns? I’d give them a C, then again, a lot of teams got a weird grade."
Jeff Green I believe is at 10 past 7 yrs
"Which fits in nicely with the Jazz's ""Sign a potentially useful veteran free agent and then cut them in December"" trend of the last few years. The real question is if he'll contribute more than Jeff Green and Ed Davis did before he gone."
I agree. I’m a Gonzaga fan tho so I’m pretty bias lol. I just hope the wizards can help him hone his skills and maybe get some veteran players like Jeff Green or someone similar to mentor him
The fake GOAT wouldn’t be relevant if he was guarded by athletes instead of pe teachers   Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs subway sandwich makers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Also LeGOAT has the best game 7 performances in nba playoff and finals history.   Think before you type my dude
"He maybe wasn’t thought of as a top 5 potential type dude initially but Jeff Green showed flashes of being able to play at that level throughout the first few years of his career. He was just so frustratingly inconsistent. Like with OKC and even when he was in Boston later he would have some games where he could ball out against like Bron or KD and stuff the stat sheet, 30/5/5 on great shooting, legit looked like a potential all-star. And then the next night he’d put up like a 1/5 for 4 points and 2 rebounds in 30 minutes played against like Charlotte or Sacramento or something. And he’d keep this pattern up for most of the first half of his career, where he’d have like a few monster games every once in a while, and then just do absolutely nothing the next few.  Idk if his heart condition had anything to do with the inconsistency, or if that’s just the kind of player he is, but he definitely was often thought of as potentially great but just couldn’t put it together and became a role player."
"I mean Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Shamet are pretty much better shooters than anyone left on the Warriors in 2019 after Klay got injured. Blake was also very good once he moved to Brooklyn.  Pretty much everyone outside of Draymond/Iggy were like out of rotations the very next year. Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, injured Boogie weren't rotation quality players. And the two guys who were in Dray/Iggy are poor shooters who defenders will happily not guard - even an injured Harden receives more defensive attention.  The 2019 Raptors were also a better team than the 2021 Bucks. Kawhi was at the height of his game and EVERY single player on the Raptors was a very good defender and a good shooter and most of them good playmakers too. FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol all good passers for their position while being able to shoot and defend, and then Danny Green, Norman Powell, Ibaka all being more 3 and D (+ more for powell)."
"I only watch the Warriors, so Jordan Poole and Kevon Looney are the 2 most underrated on that team. Vets like Jeff Green are also pretty undervalued."
Jeff green missed 3 games too. Bucks got so lucky
The funny part is Jeff green missed 3 games too
Without any help he was 1 inch away from winning 2 games. He only won one without Kyrie and Jeff Green had 27 in that game so I wouldn’t even say that was without help
"Jeff Green made open shots. Theoretically, you are supposed to make open shots."
Kyrie and Harden were healthy to begin the series. Durant and Jeff Green on their own don't take the Bucks 7 games.
"im sorry sir, but you have forgotten about the killer role player Jeff Green."
Yet lebron has more 40 point games than him in the finals vs Defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny ainge and Jeff Hornasec
"Lol you act like you guys weren’t the better for the first 3 games. KD and Kyrie are a better team than us. After he went down we won 3 of the next 4 games and the one we lost KD had one of his best performances of not his best and that really wouldn’t of mattered if Jeff Green didn’t shoot 7/8 from 3.   It’s fine to say we would’ve lost to a healthy Nets team because I don’t believe there’s a single nba team right now that would beat them 4 times if they were healthy but this whole “KD took y’all to 7 games by himself” narrative is fucking dumb.  I honestly dread facing the healthy Nets (if that ever happens) not because I know we will lose but because this sub will never let the bucks live it down, especially the annoying ass bandwagon fans they have."
"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6n2jrw  jeff green ""i played like poop"" with jared sullinger laughing"
The nets with the same roster minus jeff green just took the champs to 7 in a series where harden couldn’t run and Kyrie played less than half. They’re hefty favorites

"Somehow, what if Jeff Green doesn't shoot 7/8 from 3 in game 5 never gets asked lol.     Bucks were victims of the variables in Bud's 1st season and won it all with them in his 3rd.  Not to say you can't criticize him but most of the criticism here was straight up inaccurate and purely results based, not that he won the title it's just due to luck lol.     (IE.   'adjustments'.  He made adjustments, Bucks just didnt win so they dont count)"
"Jeff Green was available and DNP to finish the series. Dinwiddie was out all year. Neither would have started.   The Bucks were without their starting SG.  Yes, depth matters."
If you think the depth argument is legit your actually deluded. The nets nearly beat the bucks with missing 4 key players for most of the series. Jeff green/dinwiddie/kyrie/harden. No other team would’ve been even close with missing those players. That team by itself is a contender and we nearly beat the bucks with that team not even playing.   This bucks depth argument is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Would the bucks have been anywhere if jrue and middleton were hurt ? They would’ve gotten swept

"When LeBron joins a team, he becomes the system and the team builds their roster around him. So naturally when he is off the court those players will struggle considerably and when he leaves, his teams become terrible as they have to reconstruct their roster entirely. Bosh and Love both had to take steps back as players when they joined LeBron, Wade had to after 1 season give LeBron the keys so he could play better. Many of the Cavs role players ended up improving, like Crowder, Clarkson, Jeff Green and even guys like Ingram on the Lakers once they were given more freedom to operate. Now of course LeBron is an all time level playmaker, but the idea that he always makes everyone better seems like a stretch to me."
Houston Jeff Green was really solid
feels like I'll be the only one to remember that Jeff Green would attempt a poster dunk at least once a game
jeff green
He shoulda fed….   *checks notes  Joe Harris and Jeff Green more.
"In the short term, yes, but now we're starting to see it actually pay off and the strategy is making more and more sense. Listening to the recent media availabilities from guys like AG and Jeff Green, it's clear that players are beginning to view Denver as a safe and healthy option for their careers. They trust Denver and that helps outweigh factors that would typically attract them to a larger market or coastal city.  Also looking at Monte and Will is very important. I think we all agree that both of them could have gotten more money elsewhere. Would you take less money to go to a team that might turn around and trade you a few months later? Of course not. Then you could end up with less money AND in some shitty place you don't want to be. Most players would go for more guaranteed money, so for them to choose Denver really highlights how much players trust Denver on their word. It kinda sucks that Denver is in a position where they have to roll over so much, but I don't think acting more ruthlessly would have gotten us to where we are now."
"Nets aren't unbeatable even if healthy. Their defense was crap and their loss of Jeff Green only made it worse.  People use a useless stat of an irrelevant sample size to defend this point.  I know they were 3rd in DRtg in the playoffs. But that stat is meaningless. In the regular season DRtg is useful because everyone plays the same teams (not the same number of times but it roughly balances out).  In the playoffs which offenses you play are going to completely skew your DRtg.  So in round 1 the Rockets played the Celtics who had a 114.0 ORtg in the regular season (with Jaylen playing 60 games). In the playoffs against Brooklyn they had a 118.3 ORtg with no Jaylen.   In round 2 the Bucks struggled offensively, but they also only shot 30% from deep as a team, after shooting 39% in the regular season. Studies have shown opponent 3PT% is more luck than anything else.  If you just normalise 3PT% then Milwaukee would have had 114.3 ORtg in round 2 against Brooklyn, which is only slightly worse than their regular season 117.2 ORtg. But beyond that part of the reason Milwaukee struggled offensively was because Brooklyn wasn't playing Kyrie and Harden at the same time, and used lineups with more defensive talent.  So all in all :  They were a crap defense in the regular season (23rd in the league), they were crap defensively against Boston (who outperformed their regular season ORtg despite slightly unlucky shooting and missing fringe All-Star Jaylen Brown) and were mostly just very lucky defensively against Milwaukee (only slightly held them down offensively, in part thanks to the Kyrie/Harden injuries forcing better defenders on the floor).  So I still don't see any evidence whatsoever that Brooklyn's defense can even be league average, and there's literally no precedent for a team that bad defensively to win a title, no matter how good they are offensively.  I'd pick Milwaukee to beat them in a rematch even at full health."
Yeah and he had Jrue/Khris while the other had Joe Harris and Jeff Green.   Did him going off against the Suns change your ranking of him? Or was he always number 1 for you?
"Not good business for a small, traditionally undesirable market like Denver. Tim Connelly has meticulously created a reputation for doing right by his players. It's the only chance for a place like Denver to retain players and attract free agents. If the Nuggets betray Murray like that, what message does that send to MPJ? Does AG decide to sign an extension? Does Jeff Green come over in unrestricted free agency? Do guys like Will Barton and Monte Morris take pay cuts to stick around? It might be good business for a season, but it would be a suicidal business decision after that."
Jeff Green in game 4 was outrageous.
"I can't describe the emotions seeing Joe Harris shoot open 3's in that series. ""NO! No wait maybe it's good! No wait it's still Joe Harris on an open three!"" and then I'd usually experience relief.  That said only *two* Bucks players shot better from 3 than Harris did that series. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin were basically stealing everyone's ability to hit 3's."
"Yoo I'm straight up not having a good time right now  If he was just a liiiiitle bit better man, couldn't hit the far side of the barn...KD became the literal only scoring option for the whole team after Kyrie went down (besides Jeff Green magically coming back from injury and dropping 27 in Game 5 lol)"
He thinks after vaccination he will end up like Jeff Green from the all star he is today.
"The point is it wasn’t just KD the entire series. If it was the series would have been over in 5 games easily.   People wanted to talk about how much depth they had last season but since everyone not named KD, Harden or Kyrie now y’all wanna say he had no help lmao. He wouldn’t have won game 5 if it wasn’t for Jeff green and he wouldn’t have got close to winning in game 7 if it was for Harden getting some our guys in foul trouble by foul baiting for 7 FTs in the first quarter. Let’s not sit here and act like KD scored every single point for the Nets and had absolutely no help “kid”."
“Barely beat Durant”  Do people not realize we beat him 3 out of 4 games? The one game he won Jeff Green stepped up huge.   But yeah let’s keep going with this stupid narrative.
"&gt; Lmao why are you compring them to Milwaukee when they aren’t the Cavs matchup?  Because KD in those last 4 games played as well (if not better) under similar circumstances vs a much better team. Yet you and all the clowns in this thread are saying he wouldn't even get past a 48 win team led by Victor Oladipo lmfao. Just put 2 and 2 together.  &gt; So KD aint gonna be playing with 27 points Jeff Green cuz he wouldnt and didnt show up in that series vs Pacers.   And you know that how exactly? Do you live in some alternative universe where KD underperformed vs the 2018 Pacers?    &gt; Man, you realize that was the 1 time a teammate played efficiently during the 7 games right?  Korver also scored 18 points on 75 TS% in a close game 4 to avoid going down 3-1   &gt; But how about the other 2 guys also averaging 10 a game?   I like how you keep spamming so and so player's PPG while completely ignoring the lower pace of the series lol. LeBron scored 27.5% of his team's points while KD scored 26.1%. But ya I'm sure that extra 1.4% that KD got from his teammates made all the difference, amiright?"
"We are talking about if KD goes to the Cavs in 2018. So those guys will be the competition he will be facing. Lmao why are you compring them to Milwaukee when they aren’t the Cavs matchup? The point is those guys aren’t scrubs either. A league leader in blocks and an all-star was part of the supporting cast.   If you forgot, Jeff Green showed up in game 7 of the ECF in 2018 lmao. And they didnt change they way they used him as well. But he didnt in the 1st Round. So KD aint gonna be playing with 27 points Jeff Green cuz he wouldnt and didnt show up in that series vs Pacers.   Man, you realize that was the 1 time a teammate played efficiently during the 7 games right? You had to go all the way to the last game just to find a good performance, and the fact he only had 15 just shows how low that team’s supporting cast was.   Oh yeah 2 points per game difference. Not that much, yea. But how about the other 2 guys also averaging 10 a game?   Are you trying to say both teams’ supporting cast were on the same level? Cuz one had 7 guys shooting 45+% while the other had 4. The Nets’ defense were also miles ahead of that of the Cavs.   And if you’re trying to say KD actually used Jeff Green better than Lebron did, lmao. Cuz KD completely iced all his teammates out of the game in the 4th and OT of game 7, including Jeff Green.    Yea the man aint gon win with the cast the Cavs would give him."
"&gt; domantas sabonis, miles turner, lance stephenson, thad young  Are you suggesting that those guys are better than Middleton, Jrue, Lopez, etc?   &gt; For KD in the last 4 games, Jeff Green dropped 27 in a pivotal game 5  LeBron had Jeff Green in 2018 too, not KD's fault that Bron didn't make the most of him. Isn't one of the popular narratives about your guy is that he supposedly makes everyone around him better?   &gt; In game 7, Harden dropped 22 (with bad shooting)  In game 7 TT put up 15/10 (with great shooting, 86 TS%)  &gt; K.Love with 11 per game  KD's second best scorer averaged 13.5 ppg. And the difference is only there because of the much higher pace this year compared to the 2018 series"
"Ok then lets focus on the 1st round. The oladipo pacers werent just oladipo. They also had domantas sabonis, miles turner, lance stephenson, thad young etc. Some great defenders and good on offense as well. They were no joke. Now lets compare the Cavs team. Second leading scorer: K.Love with 11 per game. No other teammate reaches 10 ppg. NO teammate scored 20 throughout the entire 7 games.   For KD in the last 4 games, Jeff Green dropped 27 in a pivotal game 5. In game 7, Harden dropped 22 (with bad shooting). And that was in 4 games. Throughout the series, 4 guys were averaging 10+ points per game. Way better supporting cast than what the Cavs had.   So no, he wouldnt get past the 1st round, and if he somehow did, he wouldnt make it all the way to the finals. There, happy?"
Well in that hypothetical I don't think kd would feed Jeff Green as much and would just drop 55+ himself
Okay let's look at it this way. KD could've dropped 49 in game 5 like he did but if Jeff Green doesn't shoot like 80% from 3 on like 9 attempts they lose in six. How's that for a hypothetical?
Jeff green signing was great. And I'm a huge fan of Bones hyland. He can straight up ball.
"The Cavs 2018 supporting cast was garbage. They were literally the worst defense in history to win a playoff series (much less make the finals). And outside of the Raptors series they weren't good on offense either.  KD would be forced to do a TON defensively on that Cavs team. And instead of getting covered by the likes of Jeff Green, he's now getting guarded by Iggy/Draymond.  Warriors could switch a ton too."
&gt; Jeff Green to Denver 2 years 10 million ---- chasing that bag ... greedy; don't care about ring  &gt; Jeff Green to Brooklyn vets minimum ---- chasing that ring... greedy; don't care about his family  People here just want to shit on players or see players fail. Every time there’s a trade request or a contract negotiation it’s the same thing. When Schroeder fumbled the bag people were gleeful. I don’t personally understand it but I suspect it’s jealousy.
"Not to shit on you but who wouldn't if you're a role player? How many players get that type of money in their mid 30s as a role player? It was his last big contract to secure some more money for his family. If the planets were aligned, he wanted to be in the Northeast especially during the pandemic, chase a bag and a ring.   We can make an example out of Jeff Green then...  Jeff Green to Denver 2 years 10 million ---- chasing that bag ... greedy; don't care about ring  Jeff Green to Brooklyn vets minimum ---- chasing that ring... greedy; don't care about his family"
"Jeff Green and I overlapped for undergrad, I'm just happy he's still in the league. Makes me feel less old."
"They win a title. Horford is still a good starting center, PJ is a good 3&amp;D wing and Millsap is somewhat serviceable. Start Jeff Green instead of him"
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
"Ok I am not fine with the fact Jeff Green is 35, what the fuck"
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
Jeff Green is on both teams lol and he's 3 years younger on the Cavs.
Nets. Both have fairly equal supporting casts but the role players on the Nets stepped up better (i.e Jeff Green scoring 27 in game 5) than the Cavs role players did with Bron.
I’m glad to see Jeff green finally got paid.   I’m unhappy that Bol isn’t getting more run
"it's called not being prisoner of the moment  they were always good players, they just didn't have time to get acclimated to the system  george hill has been a solid guard in the league for years  larry nance been a promising young lob threat  rodney hood was balling in utah, what you forgot?  jeff green was good even in cleveland  clarkson didn't become this nice until recently, but he was still a microwave guy off the bench as a laker  only lebron apologists shit on his 2018 supporting cast to big him up  they shouldn't have blew the rose/wade core up in the first place though"
Jeff green was solid in Cleveland he didn’t play bad
Nets. Blake Griffin and Jeff Green were great
It’s only because all those guys at the time sucked ass and now they’re all quality role players.  George Hill with the Bucks helped take them to the ECF being a top 4 player for them.  Larry Nance became really good afterwards.  Rodney Hood on the Trail Blazers was amazing.  Jeff Green turned out to be a really high quality rotation guy.   Clarkson became a 6th man.   At the time they were all playing like ass. Pretty sure Clarkson was statistically like the worst finals performer ever.
Agreed completely. He was a much better fit for what they needed than Perkins and they would have still had Jeff Green
I like bringing Rivers back. I love adding Jeff Green and he's so much better than Millsap. He's starter quality. Bones Hyland is a great pick and a steal. He's going to be a real scorer.
"Neutral. Nothing too crazy, Jeff Green &lt; Paul Millisap, but barely, because of the positional logjam being cleared up at big"
"The off-season moves were solid, but Jeff Green and Bones Hyland are not going to be difference makers this year. It's all about Murray coming back healthy and MPJ continuing to improve."
"I like the Jeff Green signing. He’s a solid Vet and can really show up in the playoffs in crucial moments.   Bringing back Barton, Green, and Rivers were good moves as well.   My only gripe is the AG contract. Yes they kind of needed to bring him back but I see it as a big overpay. Not sure what AG has shown to deserve that kind of money. He’s solid defensively, but that offensive production is going to have to come up or that contract could look bad in a couple years."
"Jeff Green is good, that’s it"
Jeff Green is a good if not better Paul Milsap replacement.
"LeBron James and Jeff Green.  Their skillsets are similar, their talent gap could not be much wider."
Imagine having less 40 point games than lebron in the finals while being guarded  by literal pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec than he had vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green.   Paul pierce would have had 6 rings if he played in the 90s  K enough about the subway sandwich maker era
Robert Horry is on a short list of guys who don't seem to age at all;  \- Richard Jefferson  \- Andre Iguodala  \- Jeff Green  I'm sure there's others but they seem to have looked the same age forever
Jordan has less 40 point games in in the finals while being guarded by pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec than lebron does vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green
I think your home field advantage was really strong mainly due to your guys being able to play really physical defense which wasn't flying in the nets stadium. Ofc on the flip side your perimeter defenders not being able to use the full scope of their ability at the Barclays center is a boom for our offense. But mainly I wasn't feeling super confident at y'all's stadium even with kyrie. I think you guys were the better team than KD only nets but by the margin of taking one away game by the skin of your teeth.  Also don't forget the only reason Jeff green had to make Steph curry look like Westbrook was because joe Harris was making Westbrook look like Steph curry out there lol.
How do you want to count it here? Depending how you’re looking at game 4 we were either 2-2 when KD had Kyrie in support and these “Bucks/Giannis woulda been washed” takes are stupid or we were 3-1 when Kyrie was out and even that one win required Jeff Green making Steph Curry look like Russell Westbrook from three.
"With regards to the Nets series, double Durant all the time, make hobbled Harden and old Blake/Jeff Green/ and Joe Harris beat you. On offense, attack Harden and Blake in PnR's, make extra passes because the old stiffs in Brooklyn can't keep up. Be physical with Durant when screening him off to tire him even more. Now obviously I can't MAKE the Bucks players listen to me as I don't have the experience, but I would have done these at least."
"To be honest Giannis’s defense has taken a hit for me these last few playoffs, he has never once guarded the other teams best guy, never guarded Jimmy, didn’t guard KD, he’s been an off ball defender in the playoffs, not to say he’s still not a great defender but I can’t put him up there with all time greats if he’s sitting guarding Jeff green in the corner while KD is cooking his team"
Flat top Jeff green 😂😂
Okay but Joe Johnson was an elite clutch shooter. Him saying this supports his practice and mindset but it may not be the case for Benjamin. It's like when all time greats become coach's or announcees and tell other players yeah just do this or just do that. Like yeah it's easier to say than do. Remember when Magic said Lonzo would be all time Laker great? James Worthy supported Jeff Green when an announcer said he was the next James Worthy? Like these dudes are supportive but it has no bearing on facts as much as you'd think.
"This^  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dl5udb/wojnarowski_boston_celtics_forward_jaylen_brown/  some comments  &gt;He averaged 13/4/1 last year and just got 29 mil/year lol what the fuck  &gt;Overpaid but had to  &gt;For 13/4, it’s an over pay. For his performance two years ago without kyrie and his playoff performance, it’s an okay pay...  &gt;28 mill for 13 ppg and 4 rpg yikes  &gt;holy massive overpay lmfao   &gt;they gave 30 big ones to flat top jeff green  &gt;I like Jaylen but thats an overpay and a half"
We won 3 out 4 times when it was just KD.. I think that’s pretty easily. And again the one game he won he had help from Jeff green.
Lmao stop and be objective for a minute man. When people say he didn’t have help we mean relative to the competition. Having Kyrie half the series is not the same as having Khris Middleton for the whole series. Blake Griffin is not comparable to Jrue Holiday. Bruce Brown and fucking Jeff Green going off in one of the four games he was healthy enough to play in is not comparable to Brook or PJ lol. They were so desperate they let Harden play absolutely terribly on one leg for 4 games for crying out loud. Like try and be objective for a second. That is not a good supporting cast.
"So you just agreed with me about Jeff green lol   My point is people keep saying “KD almost beat y’all with no help” when really he had Kyrie for 3 and a half games and was up 2-1. The one game KD won without Kyrie or harden, Jeff green stepped up. Without that game for Green it would have been a blowout loss for the Nets.   After game 3 we were 3-2 with KD and Kyrie in the season so no it’s not a for sure thing we would have lost."
Jeff Green played well in 1/4 games and was not much of a factor at all really. Blake and Bruce Brown were probably KD’s second and third best players throughout that series. Maybe Kyrie over Brown in the 4 games he got to play in. If he or Harden were even sort of healthy the entire series it’s really unlikely you win. I’m not sure what to tell you if you think otherwise. I hate the Nets but you gotta be realistic.
Lol why do people keep on with “almost lost to KD himself”?   It’s not like KD was by himself the entire series and when he was by himself he literally had to help to win the one game he did from Jeff Green. If he didn’t hit 7/8 from 3 that game would have been a blowout even with KD going off.
Jeff Green was tossed around a lot for the same reasons.
"Who are his teammates?  We transporting the likes of Jeff Green, Mo Williams, and Ira Newble?   Or is he going to get one of those top west like teams. He'd run through a lot of shit if he had like a Nash + 20 pts scorer Finley on his team..  Is he going to get a Spurs-like team, Lakers-like team???  The fact that we're even having the pretense that he'd play with the  Cavs like team against these absolute stacked ass teams shows just how high a standard we hold this guy too.   Give LeBron a western conference type of team and he's making a lot of those finals."
I’ve wanted us to get Jeff Green for the past two years now
Same Puerto Rican that swept kobe?   Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did vs subway sandwich makers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Get over it. Lebron passed Jordan in 2016  He would be dorezen outside the expansion era
"That second half was nightmares. And deeply underappreciated is that Jeff Green had 27 points on 8-11 shooting (7-8 from 3, 4-4 on FTs) that game. You can't really say that Jeff Green won them the game when KD was playing like that, but maybe Jeff Green won them the game just a little bit."
"That’s the reason why I’m so worried about playing against Jokic and Embiid. They’re just so big and strong, but you can’t put all your chips into a big post defender when most other teams will just got small with Batum or Jeff Green at the 5 to abuse him on he perimeter.   There’s only a few guys in the league that can play good defense against Embiid and also against small ball 5s. Then you’ve got guys like Porzingis that are too thin to defend against Embiid but also too immobile to defend on the perimeter either"
"“Barely handle”  We beat them 3 out of 4 games after Kyrie went down lol hell we even beat KD and Kyrie before the injury and was still  ahead a little before Kyrie got injured.   Yes KD went off in game 5 but people act like he won that game by himself lol if Jeff Green didn’t turn into Curry that game would have still been close to a blowout loss for the Nets even with KDs 49 pts.   Game 7 Khris and Jrue shot 30% FG and like 20% from 3, had they not done that, that game wouldn’t have went to OT.   So again, their biggest challenge will be getting those two guys atleast somewhat consistent."
"I feel like Jeff Green always have this kind of game, once in a while in the playoffs. He just pop off"
I believe this was also the quarterly game that Jeff Green showed up for
"Jeff Green, anyone?"
Watched nba since the early 90s   Lebron is better and it’s not even close   Million times better finals performances vs million times better teams  More 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like leonard and green than Jordan did vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   There wouldn’t be a Jordan era if even Durant played in the expansion era 90s  Imagine only making 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Somehow Jeff Green gets traded to all of these teams.
Jordan had less 40 point games in the finals vs Pe Teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   than Lebron did vs defensive players of the year Like Leonard and Green  Not starting an argument just stating a FACT
"This is my hottest take I guess but I don’t think KD was undoubtedly the best player on the floor, he and Giannis were roughly equal.  KD *looked* better because he was hard carrying and taking all the shots while the Bucks were still playing team ball and that’s what people focus on but the results were very similar. People also *wildly* overrate the disparity in support casts because KD was doing so much and the Bucks should have been much better on paper, but again as far as actual performance goes there wasn’t a big difference.   We had two bench players play themselves out of the rotation because they were so bad while also missing a starter, it was Lopez’ worst matchup and consequently worst series of the playoffs, Holiday played great defence but he was doing it on an injured James Harden who wasn’t doing much anyway while he put up Bledsoe-tier shooting splits, and Middleton disappeared every time we played in Brooklyn.  On paper Jrue/Middleton/PJ/Lopez/Portis/Connaughton takes the fattest shit on the cast KD had around him, but all those dudes fuckin sucked and while KD’s cast certainly didn’t turn into world beaters they played alright. And in the one game KD actually won without Kyrie he had Jeff Green and Blake Griffin absolutely turning into world beaters for the night.  Giannis carried the fuck out of the Bucks in that series, it’s no coincidence the one actually bad game he had we lost by 40. But in the modern NBA nobody gets credit for a carry job if they’re not spending half the game isoing at the top of the key and their support cast still looks ok on paper."
"Danny Ainge would probably be a pretty good player in today’s era. Give me prime Jeff Green though, he was really good for like one year"
"few others that came to mind are Gerald Green, Dante Cunningham, Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Tyler Zeller, Hollis Thompson, Ty Lawson (i understand this one but dude can BALL), Dion Waiters, John Henson, DeMarcus Cousins, Amir Johnson, Jarrett Jack, Jeremy Lin, Jeff Teague, Bismack Biyombo, Courtney Lee, Brandon Goodwin, Ersan Ilyasova, Brandan Wright, Mo Speights"
"Jeff Green.   He had it in him to take over games and it would happen every now and then, but he just never was able to bring it like that every night. He'd go off for like 40/10/3/2/2 and then score 15 points combined over the next three games.   Now it seems like he's got the intensity more consistent as a role player, but the athleticism isn't there anymore."
Paul Millsap and Jeff Green were both designed to be big 3 superstars. Big guys with decent jumpshots who can guard just about anyone? Yup
Not a one hit wonder but Jeff green is a great role player most of the playoffs then has one random ass crazy game
The salary cap is almost triple what it was then. Danny green was a 5ppg guy at the same phase of his career as herro is now. If Jeff green didn’t miss an entire season with a hear condition when his value was highest hed be paid a lot more.
"Sure it’s possible but is it that likely? He’s not a star nor a star in the making. Jeff Green’s lengthy career is gonna hit $86M at the end of 2021-22, Danny Green will be at $91M at the end of this season. Obviously pretty random comps, but both Greens are certainly not nobodies and have been around a long time."
"If there's a word that combines the disposition of being both naive and delusional then I want to know because that's what I would describe you as. Anyway.........                              &gt; Imagine only making 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history               Weakest era? In the original top 50 players of all time, 19 of them won championships or MVPs in the 80s &amp; 90s. 29 of them played in the 80s or 90s. If you look at the top 20 players of all time, 12 of them played against Jordan in the 80s and 90s. That era was stacked with all time greats, you should probably put that narrative into the bottom shelf where it belongs.              With the Bulls, Jordan literally played only 11 full seasons, two were cut short by injury and retirement. His years on the Wizards are an afterthought in any reasonable thinking person's mind and should be disregarded. So he basically made 6 finals in 11 seasons, a 54.5% rate. If we take a similar tone with LeBron, we disregard his rookie season as he was just out of high school but he soon hit his stride in year two averaging 27/7/7. That's 17 full seasons. He's made the Finals 10 of those, a 58.8% rate. Impressive but not a night and day difference, *and* he's been building superteams that entire time, basically breaching anti tampering and collusion guidelines in the process. Hardly something that deserves the respect of fans aside from those who are equally bereft of morals and ethics. If we take that further and look at championships won, well Jordan remains on 54.5% while LeBron falls to just a 23.5% success rate on his custom built superteams.                &gt; But he sure did beat Shawn kemp and Drexler.                    And LeBron sure did beat DeRozen &amp; Lowry on his way to the Finals in 2018. Yet you'll talk about him carrying that team to the Finals like some kind of superhero, how he beat 19yo Tatum in the Conference Finals like it was some kind of historical achievement.                    &gt; Lebron has more game winners in the playoffs than Jordan, Kobe and Curry COMBINED                Define 'game winners'. This thread is about buzzer beaters and the sample size is so small that it's a ridiculous statement to make. What if LeBron had 2 and Jordan had 1? You'd probably come out and say 'OMG LeBron has TWICE the game winners as MJ!!'. It's just dumb.                &gt; Million times better finals performances and more 40 point games in the finals   Now you're just plain embarrassing yourself. You honestly sound like a 15 year old. Both Jordan and LeBron have been phenomenal in the NBA Finals, both have stratospheric stats. There is no way any rational thinking human being could summise that LeBron was 'a million times' better. It's a nonsensical conclusion given the evidence at hand.             Sure, Lebron has 8 40 point games vs Jordan's 6 in the Finals but he has played 55 Finals games to get those 8. Jordan played 35 Finals games. Also, LeBron averaged 28.4ppg in the Finals. Jordan has averaged 33.6ppg. Despite the disparity in ppg, the TS% is negligible, 55.9% for Jordan vs 56.2% for LeBron.                   &gt; vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and Green than jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec                              In his 6 Finals appearances, Jordan faced a player who was named All Defense *that same season* five out of six times. The only time he missed facing one he still had an opponent who was an all league defender just two seasons earlier. Also, it's a *team* game. Jordan's Bulls faced a top 10 defensive team in all but one series. LeBron has faced a team outside the top ten three times.                     &gt; Best finals and playoffs performances of all time                 *Some* of the best. But so does Jordan. What the hell is your point here?                 &gt; Scored more than Jordan on 2k less shots                     This is such a dumb argument. LeBron literally has twice the number of shot attempts within 3ft of the rim than Jordan has. This stat is simply a reflection of their playing styles. Jordan has ten scoring titles, LeBron has one. Nobody on this planet is stupid enough to think LeBron is the superior scorer simply because he took less shots to make his points. It's insane.                      &gt; Jordan wouldn't make the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 Cavs teams LeGOAT took to the finals. Im talking about in the modern era not the expansion era where Jordan made the playoffs going 30-52.                 Oh, we're making purely subjective points now are we? How the hell do you know what Jordan would have done on those teams? It's impossible to say. Also, that 30-52 team was his freaking *rookie* season and nowhere near the expansion era.                  &gt; There wouldn't even be a jordan era if even Durant played in the expansion era 90s                     More subjective nonsense.                         &gt; Literally never won 1 measly playoff series without Pippen guarding the opposing teams best players                        You have no idea who Pippen was guarding. Bulls won their first playoff series with Jordan averaging 45/5/5 with 4.4 stocks. Pippen was a rookie averaging half of Jordan's minutes and had a worse defensive rating that series. In fact Pippen never made an all defensive team until 1991, meanwhile the Bulls won 5 playoff series prior to that season. You're just straight up making stuff up right now.                 &gt; Played with way more ALL NBA AND ALL NBA Defensive teammates                    More straight up lies. LeBron has played with 26 All NBA &amp; All Defensive players in his career. Jordan played with 9. In case you are wondering, 26 is greater than 9.                    &gt; Its not even close anymore bud, and i watched nba since the early 90s                       Well it is close, kind of, but it isn't Jordan who is running second here. He is still sitting on the throne. Most sane people realise this, it's why 70% of respondents on average, across many surveys with 100s of thousands of respondents, all put Jordan as the GOAT while just 15% have LeBron as theirs. That's a landslide victory. Those surveys not only include fans but NBA players, NCAA coaches etc. If it were an election result it would be an embarrassing loss for LeBron.             Not only is public opinion heavily in Jordan's favour, so are the important aspects of a basketball player's legacy. I'm talking about stats, accolades and team success. Team success is an easy one, 6 championships vs 4....and LeBron got his four by stacking his teams with All NBA talent (as evidence above) building superteams everywhere he has played. It's a shameful act of deceit how he has in fact accumulated the team success he has, literally by breaching anti tampering rules and talking top ten talent into joining up. How can you admire a player who does that? He is taking the easy road to the Finals every damn season and somehow you think that is praise worthy? It hurts my brain to think about.           In terms of personal accolades, it's quite clear who is on top. 5 MVPs vs 4. 6 Finals MVPs vs 4. 1 DPOY vs none. 9 All Defensive 1st teams vs 5. 9 scoring titles vs 1. 3 steals titles vs none. The only thing LeBron leads in is All NBA teams and he has one assist title. But Jordan did pretty much all that in just 11 eligible seasons on the Bulls while LeBron is going into his 19th season and still won't catch up. Hard to beat 13 All NBA 1st teams when you play just 11 eligible seasons and another 2 as a near 40yo on bad knees.              Finally, MJ has LeBron beat in just about every advanced metric which aggregates box score stats and which can be applied to career numbers. In terms of *per game* numbers, he leads Lebron in BPM, WS, VORP, PER, RAPTOR +/-, RAPTOR WAR in *both* the playoffs and regular season. Hell, if you want to apply game score to their career numbers then MJ is ahead. The only statistical argument LeBron has is in longevity biased stats, so career totals...but that will happen when one guy plays 61k minutes in the regular and post season and the other plays 48k.           For someone who claims to have watched the game since 1990 you sure seem to be struggling in your analytical skills. I'm thinking maybe Jordan torched your teams in the 90s and stopped your favourite players from winning chips? There must be some kind of stupid bias here. Oh wait, I've got it, you must be a Cavs fan. MJ ripped your team's collective hearts out several times while LeBron is your cities greatest champion. No wonder you're so blind to the truth. Makes sense..."
"East: 1. Bucks- consistently great regular season team under Bud, don’t see that changing. They were right in the mix last year even though they had that one horrid stretch where Jrue/Khris were both out.  2. Hawks- bold take, I know, but they were on 56-win pace with Nate in charge and Hunter missed most of the season. They’re insanely deep and should be a good regular season team.  3. Nets- they’re the best team in the East IMO, just don’t see them killing the regular season due to lack of depth and resting Harden/KD/Kyrie.  4. Heat- they played well with Jimmy last year, and Lowry is a nice add. They got better without giving up much.  5. 76ers- think they’re a good team, but the Simmons absence/inevitable trade make them worse than last year. Also don’t count on Embiid staying healthy, and Drummond’s a bad add.  6. Pacers- they were a solid playoff team before Bjorkgren, and I think they’ll bounce back with Carlisle. I also rate Duarte as a draft pickup.   7. Celtics- think other teams did more to get better, they’re probably better than last year but just got leapfrogged.   8. Knicks- let’s be honest, they overperformed expectations last year. I think the Celtics/Pacers/Heat/Hawks all got better and had less go wrong last year than the Knicks.   West: 1. Jazz- proven regular season team, Mitchell should get better and I like Paschall and Gay as bench adds.   2. Nuggets- I love the jump Jokic took last year, and I think Murray comes back 100%- ACL isn’t the killer it once was. They were the four seed even with Murray and half a year of Gordon, and Jeff Green is a solid bench add.  3. Suns- I think they fall back a bit, but they were still an elite team in the regular season last year, and hopefully they go to Ayton more in the regular season.  4. Clippers- I think the Clippers are being way underrated, and I think their non-Kawhi run last year wasn’t a mirage. PG can be that guy on a playoff team, but with Kawhi he’s been more of an overqualified Robin. Lue is a good coach who has good rotations, and the Clippers have a fairly deep squad. They didn’t get the most out of Luke Kennard last year, and they’ll hope Terrance Mann can be the guy he was in the playoffs.   5. Warriors- Klay being back is good, but two years off won’t help him. They’re still a thin team, maybe their young guys grow a bit and help them but I don’t think they’re title contenders. What I like about them is how good the defense was down the stretch, Kerr really got the most out of them defensively.   6. Blazers- we know what they are, great regular season team. Think they’re about as good with Billups as with Stotts, but not much better.   7. Lakers- controversial, I know. But I just have serious issues with this team’s roster construction. Russ has been pretty wildly inconsistent the past two regular seasons, and there are injury concerns with all three of Russ/Bron/AD. Who can you really count on from the bench? It’s a bunch of old guys who are 15-20 MPG players but the Lakers will want more. The defense will take a huge step back with these additions, and I don’t have a ton of faith in their bench offense; it’s just Monk/Nunn/Melo.  8. Timberwolves- the D’Lo/Ant/KAT lineups have been really offensively potent, Finch is a good coach, and I think teams like the Grizzlies/Spurs took a step back."
"Lebron has more game winners in the playoffs than Jordan, Kobe and Curry COMBINED  Million times better finals performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and Green than jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Best finals and playoffs performances of all time  Scored more than Jordan on 2k less shots  Get over it. There wouldn't even be a jordan era if even Durant played in the expansion era 90s"
"Funny, that's how Jeff Green once got a big contract from Orlando."
"Not to mention we traded perk, maybe our most important role player, for Jeff green who immediately needed open heart surgery.   When we took the Heatles to 7 games in 2012 Mickael Pietrus was our sixth man and he put up a fucking .383 TS% and our backup big was Greg Stiemsma. Green wasn’t a world beater or anything but losing him for the season really fucked our depth."
Which is funny because there was a time in which the Celtics were the favored trading partner of the Grizzlies.*  \* Pretty much due to Chris Wallace's relations to the Celtics FO having previously been there and before he became superconscious of Ainge giving him the worse end of their deals (Jeff Green chief among them) and finally culminating in the refusal of a proposed Tyreke Evans trade purportedly for two second rounders.)
"i don't know it's a fake on timothy luwawu cabaret, jeff green is not a defensive player and bruce brown comes in to help.  you got do down vote it just off that."
"Probably would've been a reverse sweep if the God Jeff Green didn't bury the Bucks with 3s in game 5. He scored 27, 2 more than Middleton and 8 more than Jrue, that game."
Sonics Rookie Jeff Green
"Rebound and block stats can be extremely misleading.   Not only was Jordan often times the only big man on the court, the nets also gave up like the 4th most fga per game. He also played almost exclusively at or around the rim because his lack of speed was easy to take advantage of. All of this inevitably leads to more rebounds and blocks. A much more telling stat is the nets defensive rating when he played real minutes vs when he sat. Our defense went from horribly bad to actually pretty good.   Basically yes, he was terrible at guarding the pick and roll (which pretty much every team bases their offense around) and lacked the strength to guard competent offensive big men, which is a problem when he also lacked the speed required to guard better centers who are a threat from beyond 10 feet.   Basically a black hole on defense. All the other players had to try and compensate leading to a ton of open looks from deep / easy layups.   This word gets used a ton, but he truly is washed. When a player makes Jeff Green and Blake Griffen look like Rudy Gobert at the center position defensively, there’s a problem."
Kevin Durant and Jeff Green
"He's definitely not one of the best but I like referring  to averaging 10 ppg via 20 points one night and 0 the next as a ""Jeff Green"""
"I think the wings suck.   Looking at their playoff bench, it's probably   PG: Mills  SG: Bruce Brown or MAYBE Cam Thomas if he breaks out  SF: James Johnson  PF: Paul Millsap  C: Whichever big is appropriate for the matchup (either LMA or Claxton)  Losing Jeff Green was a big blow. I like Brown and Johnson but neither of those guys are shooters. But hopefully if you're running a bunch of other sharp shooters on the floor the gravity will be too much to ignore.  Overall, the bench is a bit deeper than I expected but if they have to cut down to an 8-man group it may be rough."
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"Love Patty Thrills and LMA coming back, but man Jeff Green was so strong. Gonna miss him."
"Jeff Green too. Also if I remember right, Westbrook was drafted by the SuperSonics like 3 days before they moved."
Jeff Green too
"Yeah LeBron his teams are too old I bet for the streak to last long enough. However an interesting one is Jeff Green due to duration and being on a billion different teams.   1999: Kurt Thomas  2000-2002: Shaq 2003: Richard Jefferson 2004: Shaq  2005: Nazr Mohammed  2006: Shaq 2007: Ira Newble/LeBron 2008: KG 2009: JJ Redick 2010: KG 2011: Tyson Chandler  2012: Kevin Durant  2013: Ray Allen 2014: Ray Allen 2015: LeBron  2016: LeBron 2017: LeBron 2018: LeBron 2019: Kevin Durant  2020: LeBron 2021: Jae Crowder   His streak I bet lasts a long time. Teammates already with: Durant, LeBron, Jokic(about to be), Westbrook, Harden, Donovan Mitchell, Gobert, Beal, CP3, Kyrie. That streak will probably last a fair bit. He has ties to all the top teams this year: LAC(Ibaka), LAL, BKN, Den, Utah, Phx, Mil(Bobby Portis), Atl(Lou Will) etc"
"As someone that watched him play at IU while working security, he's kind of a jack of all trades type big, but very inconsistent in each department. he would have nights where we would just dominate the other team (shooting, rebounding, scoring inside) and other nights he would just kind of be there. like a big Jeff Green. but even when he did dominate, it felt a lot like he was just overpowering the competition. even at the time i knew it would be hard for his skills to translate to the pros.  edit: read agentzerosmyhero's post and he made a great point i can't dispute: he has a GREAT feel for the game. even when he's not on, he's usually in the right spot and making the right decision, just doesn't go in all the time. love the poor man's boris diaw comp."
"Mateen Cleaves. I've been pretty good over the years with sussing out college stars turned NBA busts (Kaminsky, Aaron Craft, etc), but I loved Mateen and thought for sure he'd translate. Broke my damn heart.  Edit: also Jeff Green. Mind you he's at least managed to stay in the league."
"I think if the Clips get an asterisk mention in Tier 2 then so should Denver. Denver with Murray, another year of development of MPJ, Jokic doing Jokic things and some good fringe moves like Jeff Green ? That’s a Finals contender in the West if anything happens to the Lakers."
The Nets have more issues than just “starting slow”  Their defense is weak and they seem to lack depth. They downgraded from Jeff Green to Milsap and rely on below average guys like Bembry Carter and Johnson to play minutes
Jeff Green fans back in the day def were a bit like this. Gotta say that he’s carved out a career for himself as a really reliable vet presence off the bench.
"Well, let’s see. Jeff Green, or Kevin Durant. I’ll take Uncle."
Jeff green a pretty big loss tbh. Griffin lost a step on offense maybe. Joe in a slump. kyrie out. IDK But with 2 top 5 players they should be better
"With Jeff Green, Shamet, Kyrie and Meth Curry all gone and Harden and Harris playing like fucking idiots, the Nets shooting has gone from a major advantage to a serious liability.  This team blows right now too many washed vets and unskilled bums. KD and Mills are the only ones really bringing it. Harden has to wake his fatass up."
"To be fair to Jeff Green, he seemed like he was on his way to taking the next step before his heart issues put him out of action."
"I like the Jeff Green comparison, but I do think he gets a bit of a pass because of his heart condition."
"Don’t go that far. He’s Jeff Green 2.0   Jeff Green would wow folks for 10-15 games a year and the rest he just slept walked. He went crazy in the playoffs for Boston one year. Think it was back to back 40 point games. But then disappeared way too easily in rest of series.   Wiggins has that in him and lacks a little dawg. He can blend in while in GS because he’s not asked to do much beyond defend. His points are gravy. A little easier being 3-5 in the pecking order. When Kay gets back, Wiggins gets to blend in more."
The nuggets had a whole year of having no wings and went out and signed Jeff green who played the 5 for the nets. The double smallball bigs with 3 guards works horribly on both ends
"It's always funny when there's a thread on a player and fans of the team have to give everyone else a reality check on that player. I don't know if there's a name for this phenomenon yet, but if not, it should definitely be named after Jeff Green"
"If he does I hope the Bucks get him next, I don't want a 46 year old Jeff Green."
"“Stagnated” suggests he’s had a peak to begin with. Imagine being 21 in your third year and your coach still gives minutes to guys like Austin “can’t play offense to save his life” Rivers, JaMychal “lead footed goof troop” Green and “Uncle” Jeff “gets burned by even the simplest inside offense” Green, while you rot away on the bench after continually showing out in opportunities. When Bol gains momentum, Malone nips it in the bud and sits him for ages. When he shows out in practice and gets praise from said coach, he receives literally no minutes at all. The Bol hate in the Nuggets community, especially when compared to the praise this derpy fucking coach gets is egregious."
"I know he’s not the best but just to match the size I’d put him in instead of a 6’8 forward  they were doubling a lot, if they’re doubling I’d rather have like Jeff Green and Bol Bol than both Greens  Bol my guy so definite bias. This is why I’m not a coach lol"
"I mean, Australia changes prime ministers more than Jeff Green changes teams.   Obligatory shoutout to my manly brethren, Gladys. Looking out for the real ones and making sure they get no consequences while the peasants in the other areas of Sydney suffer. /s"
That's why Jeff Green didn't last in Utah. He is soft and didn't want to play D. What a dive.
Jeff Green has no idea what he's doing on defense this quarter
Nets rather pay Patty Mills with the MLE than give that to Jeff Green
"Jeff Green, JaMychal Green, Javonte Green, Jraymond Green, who else?"
Maybe Jeff Green is a serial killer and wants to movie cities frequently 👀👀👀👀
They dont call him Jeff Green for nothing
jeff green been a keep getting dem checks guy going on 7 years now
"I remember being absolutely LIVID we didn't draft Quincy Miller in 2012. I thought he might be a lite version of Durant, like what MPJ is now. Turns out I should've been madder about missing on Draymond Green or Khris Middleton for Jeff Taylor. Turns out Quincy Miller wasn't even the best Quincy picked in the late 30s of that draft..."
Klove about to skip therapy this week after he's done with Jeff Green. Who knew beating on Jeff Green for only being good once a month would be so cathartic?

flat top jeff green does it again
"This moreso LeBron than the Lakers tbh  I remember when MCW looked like a HoF against the Heat in his first game  The multiple 30,40 point games from Jeff Green  Pat Bev dunking on Bosh, Manu dunking on Bosh etc"
"They're deep at certain positions, but they're weak at the wing behind KD and I really can't believe they let Jeff Green go like that. I thought he was great for them at times."
*Jeff Green
OKC's Big 3. Even before the Harden trade. They vetoed a trade for Tyson Chandler over a toe injury and then traded away Jeff Green for Perkins. They couldn't draft any supporting cast or shooters for the life of them. Held on to Scott Brooks for 3 or 4 years too long. I know I'm missing a handful of other situations that aren't very well known because NBA internet culture wasn't so all-telling back then.
Jalen Green  Josh Green  Javonte Green  Jamychal Green  Jeff Green
"Then you're either an above average NBA player's alt or delusional lmao, the only Nets with at least 1000 minutes to put up better numbers than him last year were KD, Harden, Kyrie, and arguably Harris, tho Brown does lead him in WS/48 and most defensive metrics by a decent amount, and Brown had significantly better number than the likes of Shamet, TLC, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Tyler Johnson, Prince, etc."
"Lost a bunch of guys like shamet, Jeff green etc, and got millsap, Aldridge, carter, Johnson etc. the second unit is completely different"
"“For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”  God and Jeff Green"
Jeff Green is a poor man’s KD. He’s a great player
"Ya after I wrote this I remembered they were tanking hard and when they ended up with Jeff Green that's when they made the trades to create the big 3.  I guess a charitable way to rephrase is, it's funny how playing on a good team made Pierce a better player lol.  I'm not saying he didn't deserve his all-nba nods in 2008, 2009, that Celtics team was beastly.  But I don’t think he’s getting those end of career all star nods without the 08 title."
I hated the Lance Stephenson and 1st for Jeff Green and I still do.  As for the topic I didn’t really like Gallinari on a big contract to the clippers. Injury prone and at the money a major risk. He was still pretty much injury prone but he played with a ton of heart and effort when he did play.
"This is true, but to add to it- the *idea* of Jeff Green is much more appealing than the reality of Jeff Green (or at least it was, we're probably well past that point of his career now). For years and years he seemed primed to take a leap and become a true all-star caliber guy, but then would come out and just be...pretty good, I guess."
"I don't have a particular team I root for nowadays, but I do like a few teams and follow a ton of players like Steph+Klay on the Warriors, Giannis, Trae, Luka. Former Sonics players like KD+Jeff Green. I also root for alma mater UW players like Thybulle, Dejounte Murray, etc. Fantasy Bball always helps too.   After the Seattle Kraken debut a couple weeks ago, I've been down bad missing my Supersonics."
Why has Jeff Green bounced around so much?
"ECF in 2019 was hardly a disappointment given that it had been 20 years since they'd been there. The Bubble was a letdown, sure. Obviously losing in the second round would be a disappointment.   You don't just get to simulate all the positive results, ignore any higher-risk negative outcomes unique to a team, and say that the better teams on paper or the odds-favorites in Vegas should've won if everything was perfect. Of course, but underdogs DO win. Lower seeds overcome the odds. And speculating about the Nets injuries is hardly unfair given their track record of playing together. It was pretty clear going into the playoffs that these Nets could get derailed by injury and that's exactly what happened. Yes, Harden was unexpected given his history, but he'd had hamstring issues in the regular season. Jeff Green and Kyrie getting hurt should not have been a surprise.  We also know that injuries and other factors are part of the game. I push back on this shit for the same reason I push back on people trying to delegitimize the Raptors win due to the Warriors's injuries. You've got to win the games, and discounting teams for winning the games in front of them is foolish."
Jeff Green had some huge 3s
Jeff Green had some huge 3s
And the one game they won Jeff Green gave them Kyrie level production dropping 30 points on like 7/8 from 3.  It's like when Boston went to the Ecf with scary terry playing cracked. When Kyrie was their the next year they weren't really better because his production wasn't that much better.
Jeff Green did just fine.
"Fun fact Jeff and Jamychal Green are not brothers, but they were also both on the Grizzlies at the same time before, confusing box score watchers everywhere with the ""J. Green"" conundrum"
"Jeff green gotta call it on his hair, shave it and save ur dignity man"
"I don’t get why Jeff Bezos didn’t incorporate “Key” into the arena name. I mean, I guess he didn’t care, but I feel the name could be better.   This makes me fear that whoever brings an NBA team to Seattle will not use the Sonics branding or colors. Imagine if we get the “Seattle Sound” with gray and neon green jerseys of something."
"Putting someone away in sports means to beat them, like putting toys away when you're done playing. And it was easier without Kyrie, 'KD and the hobbled Nets' won a single game without him when Jeff Green scored 27 and outplayed everyone but KD and Giannis. Either way this goes back to the original comment, Bucks won and you're going out of your way to talk about what should have happened to try and praise a dude that lost"
nets are REALLY missing jeff green
Their defense with the same core was really good against Milwaukee in the second round last year.  Jeff Green is the only real loss and he wasn't anything special defensively.  This is the regular season.  Brooklyn didn't lose because of defense last year.
they really thought they could replace Jeff green with Paul Millsap
Absolutely love the fact the Nets replaced Jeff Green with fucking Paul Millsap lmao
Yeah Jazz fans had the bad side of the Jeff Green experience
"They've shown that their defense is actually really solid when they lock in, we saw this in the playoffs.  And no, Jeff Green wasn't some defensive anchor, so his loss doesn't really matter at all defensively."
*Jeff Green in shambles*
"Yeah but Donte is actually on the team (and was incredibly important to the Bucks defense against guards before he got hurt) and Kyrie might not be coming back. Its a different argument if Kyrie comes back.   It's hard to even acknowledge Spencer as a part of last years nets team (and hes not on the team anymore). Jeff Green isnt on the team anymore (he's been replaced by milsaps corpse). We will have to see how/if Aldridge provides any problems for the bucks but thats TBD.   As of now there isn't any real gap between the two teams if Kyrie isnt playing. If they manage to trade Kyrie for another ball handler (or get kyrie back) then yeah, the nets will clearly be better on paper, but there's no guarantee. Especially with KDs age and injury history."
Donte doesn’t compare to kyrie and harden. Don’t forget Jeff green was out and so was Spencer. The bucks just aren’t nearly as good fully healthy
Off topic. But Jeff green. Is severely underrated.
Only because of Jeff Green? So Jeff Green making some threes was a fluke but Joe Harris forgetting how to shoot wasn't? By that logic I can just say the only reason tu Bucks won game 4 and 7 was because of Joe Harris. That's some confirmation bias right there. Kyrie went down in the second quarter of a 2 point game in game 4
"game winner vs. the Pacers, game winner vs. the Raptors, and the insane fast break to end game 7 vs the celtics as he's being dragged down (with Jeff green as his second best player).   not to mention the 51 pointer game 1 in the finals.   All time playoff run for LeBron in 2018. Never seen anything like it."
The series went to 7 because KD had Kyrie for 3.5 games lol the only game KD won after Kyrie went down was 5 and that’s only because of Jeff Green but you Nets fans won’t admit that.
Pov when you ask to get traded and then u get eliminated by Jeff green who’s on your old team
"&gt; This is a 7 game series that went to OT in the final game. The series features a top 5 player injured and a top 15 player injuries.  Except all of this involves counting sleight of hand. Because when the series involved a top 5 player injured and a top 15 player injured, it was 4 games that the Bucks won 3-1. It wasn't KD on his own taking the Bucks to 7 games, it was KD and Kyrie taking the Bucks to 7, with KD squeaking out a single win on his own, that came off a performance that *could not* have happened with Harden or Kyrie next to him.  I have zero issue with someone saying that they think the Nets would've won - *I* think the Nets would've won; but the argument that it was a given is exhausting, features zero imagination and picks and chooses the parts of the series to keep (Bucks were still winning Game 3 while Kyrie was there, Harden's decision making was poor outside of his injury, Jeff Green still gets to take 8 3's and make 7, KD still gets to take 23 shots on insane efficiency with another ball dominant player). If you want to think it, think it - but saying the Nets winning is inevitable isn't consistent with the entire history of the playoffs."
"Not really lol  Deserves no more hate than Jeff Schwartz, Bartelstein, and Austin Brown  Maybe people are just jealous and green with envy"
"Ahh, the Jeff Green career trajectory"
No no no no and Hell NO I’m not letting this shit slide lol  He was brought in to bring in championship culture  and a hard working mindset to the team. Let’s get the first thing out the win that Doc Rivers as a head coach only had 1 more regular season win in his tenure with lob city (57-25) 2013-14 Vinny Del Negro who at the previous season went (56-26)2012-13. The team already showed it could win regular season games the goal was to get over the hump to the WCF at minimum.  Reggie Bullock was hit with injuries so playing him was going to be difficult but Doc never went out of his way to play him.  Some ways through year two and Reggie is gone and thankfully found a lane in the league.  The Eric Bledsoe trade was botched in a few ways considering the hype and trade value Bledsoe had at the time. In hindsight the clippers never deal with Phoenix  and use Caron Butler to get JJ who was a S&amp;T and Butler ended up going to Bucks anyway  weeks later to return home. In the moment I’m still confused why Jared Dudley was a core piece in a Bledsoe trade.   Trading Dudley after 1 Year in a salary dump basically made no since at all. This move began the habit of wasting first round picks to just remove players from the team Doc didn’t like rather that using 1st to create stability on rookie contracts or add legitimate upgrades to the roster.  Jeff Green DID NOT play a big role for the team. Doc hated Lance Stephenson and wanted to play Austin Rivers more minutes (the one young player that was almost out of the league). Jeff Green joined the team and this was peak Mr. Inconsistent but he was a former Celtic so Doc loved him. By the playoffs Jeff Green went from starting 10 of 27 games to being benched and only saw his minutes kick up because Blake and Chris went down. You know what Jeff Green did after the season that we spent a 2019 first own? He left in free agency and another wasted clippers pick.  2018 was about a retool but likely rebuild. Chris Paul we going to leave and was fed up with Doc and issues with Blake. Doc did his best work with a rebuilding situation but even then let egos get in the way of the championship situation HARRELL
"Doc Rivers was brought into compete for a title with Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. He wasn't brought in to draft well and develop late first rounders and second rounders. Clippers had a legit shot at winning it all from 2012-2017 including 2 division titles, 57, 56, 56, 53 and 51 win seasons.  As an executive, he drafted Reggie Bullock at #25 (great pick), and then traded a late second rounder and Bledsoe for a package including JJ Redick who was instrumental in their 50 win seasons.  In 2014, he traded a dissapointing Dudley and a late first rounder to Milwaukee for a second rounder, Carlos Delfino an expiring was waived for cap space and Miroslav Raduljica.  Later, he selected CJ Wilcox at #28, hard to blame him for a #28 pick not panning out.Traded a late first rounder for Jeff Green, who was only 29 and played a big role on their 2016 team. Drafted Brice Johnson at #25 who didn't pan out, again, late first rounders hardly ever do.  In 2018 he traded a late first rounder for Danilo Gallinari who was coming off an all star esque season and would go on to be their best player the following season.  So in the what 8 years that your stat encompases they were competing for a title and werent focusing on developing late first rounders or second rounders, or going through a quick rebuild and contending again with Kawhi/PG, this isn't that surprising IMO."
Teams would just dare Ben Simmons to beat them because Brooklyn doesn’t have a reliable enough stretch five with Jeff Green gone.  It’s either Ben Simmons beat us or Blake/LMA/Paul Millsap beat us with jumpers.  With Kyrie you don’t have that luxury especially if Joe Harris plays like he did in the Milwaukee.
Because Jrue played nervous as hell. Won't have that pressure anymore. And they only won game 5 because Jeff green had the game of his life at the same time as durant. And bud didn't go small at the end of the 3rd which let durant score on Lopez like 5 possessions in a row that when up 15.
When did Jeff green go to the nuggets
"I vividly remember texting my Celtic fan friend in the 4th quarter, “Who the fuck is Jeff Green?”"
Jeff Green has actually bounced around quite a bit but got a solid career. Can you believe Rodney Stuckey was out the league at 30?
The Jeff Green one surprised me till I remembered he was on that 2011 Celtics team that lost to the Heat in 5.   He would be out the next season because of open heart surgery.
"And rightfully so, not trying to downgrade what they’ve done, but I’m just trying to be real. We can’t act like the bucks are world beaters when they almost lost to Kevin Durant and Jeff green. I get health is a factor, but Chances are they get destroyed by the nets next year."
🤣🤣🤣🤣 time to get Jeff Green back. And maybe Tarik Black.
"Bones as the sixth man and monte starting, move campazzo down a bit in the rotation, more Jeff green minutes"
Jeff Green and Avery Bradley are still in the league
Jeff Green for most of his career
"jeff green was like this earlier in his career  (when he was younger and people thought skillwise he should be a perennial all star). this was when he'd put up 30 one night and follow it up with, like, 6, 8, 6, 12 over the next few games, maybe then go for 20, drop back down to 8 and 10 before exploding for 30 again a few weeks later.  fans wanted him to just be aggressive and create his shot. instead, he was passive. or, as the saying goes, ""letting the game come to him."""
"Being able to fit anywhere doesn't mean you have the talent level to start everywhere.  Guys like Seth Curry, Ish Smith, Jeff Green - they can always carve out a role, but you may be in trouble if you give them 30-35."
"Jeff Green has always been an inconsistent playoff performer, if you get him it’s because you hope he can give you a random 20 point game because that’s what he’s always done, be an X factor"
"No, if we get to choose a game where Jeff Green falls asleep at the wheel, WE ARE GETTING IT. He even used to play for us then turned out to be the only player to help Lebron in game 7 in 2018."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
To me the big outlier game is actually that Jeff Green game. People bring up Joe and Brynn but both those guys are streaky shooters who have had issues in the playoffs. I don't think anybody expects Jeff Green to bury a playoff team with threes ever. Pivotal game and Jeff Green showed up huge in it.
Jeff Green has been traded for 30 first round picks on this alone
Jeff green
Then again if Jeff Green doesn’t go unconscious they don’t even make it to 7
"Lebrons second best player is Jeff Green and loses: ""get this dude out of here""  Now KD: ""wow KD, such a good effort!!!!!"""
"KD played great in that series this statement is true for me. Saying KD carried is a statement I don't consider true. I don't think I have brought up LeBron anywhere in the discussion. If Jeff Green did not go on an unbeliavable hot streak from 3pt they lose the series in six, lets not play this game you can say that for every game."
"I think the issue here is that in any given series, 3 pt shooting is so variable that some players hit + and some hit -.     Harris was missing, but Jeff Green hit like 7/8 in game 5 IIRC.  Its fair to make the what if argument if the whole team is bricking open 3's (or if the other can't miss) - but picking and choosing certain players that shoot under their normal percentage is something you can do in every series"
Jeff Green could be the answer every season.
Jeff Green
"Jeff ""Consistently Inconsistent"" Green also went bananas that game"
"I think you’re overvaluing Luka’s MVP step up and the blazers step up as well and undervaluing the nuggets lol, I could say literally the exact same thing.   MPJ started terribly and missed a bunch of games due to COVID, he’s due for a step up this year after getting his max. He was great at the end of the season after coming back and it reflected in the nuggets win percentage, expect that to continue.   They also started winning much more with the addition of AG which was midseason. Got a much better backup 5 in Jeff green too now."
"I mean not necessarily, the Bucks were leading by 4 when Kyrie went out in the 2nd half of game 4 anyway, Jeff Green went for an uber efficient game 5 that probably more than made up for Kyrie’s absence, by game 7 Harden was dropping 22/9/9, nets would’ve won that series healthy, obviously, but the Bucks probably take at least 2, if not 3. Offensive output becomes less valuable the more of it you have, Kyries middlingly efficient 22ppg is a lot less of a difference maker than you think, especially when he’s taking shots away from KD."
Looks like Jeff Green got caught ball watching!
"my take away from this game, jeff green is on the nuggets? wtf"
Jeff green
"Dude is like Jeff Green, everyone forgets."
Yea they're pretty good but injuries have hurt the depth. Also they lost Jeff Green who won them game 5 and Griffin went from amazing to horrendous
"Sorry, prepare for a long one....  MPJ was amazing for the 18 games after Murray went down, yes. But in the playoffs he was basically a 3&amp;D role player. Had some really great quarters, some really bad games (game 3 (or 4?) against Portland he scored just 3 points for instance). Put it this way - MPJ to this point in his career has not shaped a playoff series in the way that Jokic completely controlled the series against Portland, or against LAC / Utah, or Portland and SAS 3 years ago, or in the way that Jamal Murray completely changed the Utah series / Game 7 vs LAC, for instance. Hell, MPJ's never even affected a playoff series in the way that Aaron Gordon has (back with Orlando he actually did a good job defending Kawhi in their series vs Toronto, Orlando was just so overmatched it didnt really matter).  So to your point - there are a lot of guys stepping up in ways that they werent able to last year. Aaron Gordon has been terrific all year. Defensively he's been incredible, guarding 5 positions and usually the best player on the opponent. Offensively he's really blossoming in the last two weeks since MPJs injury - he's punishing switches when he has a smaller wing or guard on him (which is most games), and getting to the rim relentlessly. He didnt really get a chance to show that stuff last year. Will Barton is CLEARLY much healthier than he was in the playoffs against PHX - people will say he and Monte were healthy against PHX but they clearly are moving better, more explosively this year, etc. It's really not close. So until Jamal Murray comes back the big fill in's for MPJ will be AG and Will Barton who have been terrific all year, again, and some others here and there.  Bones is fun because he gives them a dynamic off the bench that Denver just hasnt had, maybe since JR Smith? Or since Will Barton was much younger? He can come in and immediately just fill it up and score in bunches, plays with such enthusiasm and energy. They definitely didnt have a guy like that last year off the bench.  Last point to be made as well - right now, they're starting Jeff Green at the 3/4 in place of MPJ and while the ceiling is *so much lower* for what he can do and what those lineups can do compared to the possibilities with MPJ, the frontcourt of Gordon, Green, and Jokic is something like +26 in net rating so far - 130 offensive rating, 104 defensive. That rating will come down. But Green as a smart vet who's been around just understands how to play on both ends. Understands where and when to cut, and he's enormous, and can also punish switches just as AG can, which opens more avenues for Jokic and Gordon. MPJ is more talented than Green. No doubt. But MPJ also very clearly doesnt really understand 5 on 5 basketball yet for whatever reason, at least not consistently... That's part of why he has had stretches where things look great, and stretches this year where things look bad and super clunky because he doesnt really know where to move without the ball to open things for himself or his teammates. Or he's hesitant which makes it a beat too slow.  So all that said - the Nuggets really just need to hover around 4th-6th until Jamal Murray comes back. My bet is he's back in March. And when he's back, they'll go on a big time run (partly because he makes them that much better, and partly because after ASB, the Nuggets have 23 games, 14 of them at home, and only 2 b2bs in that stretch... it's the easiest schedule in the league post ASB)."
"feel like i am crazy, but is there any reason he wasn’t always playing 3 other than people saw he was white and that he would be too slow?   he’s weak on O, but that doesn’t matter when you’re 5 inches taller. the guy is a legit NBA athlete, he moves as well as any big in the NBA and the posters are ferocious   feels like when Jeff Green was always played as a 3 and then Ty Lue made him a 4/5 exclusively and it opened up his game a ton"
I meant the rest of Denver team is kinda cheeks. Their #2 and #3 are injured and have to rely on AG and Jeff Green to be their other primary scorers.   This was definitely a winnable game for you.
"It’s only because we’re missing Kyrie. LMA, Patty and Bembry were great signings and upgrades over last season. Jeff Green is better than Millsap though."
"Come on now…Ya’ll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they’re all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don’t know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that’s the MVP."

They won’t just magically flip a switch against contenders with this incomplete roster and some marginal tweaks around the edges.

"The same exact team they have now? Harden was hobbled, but still Harden. They had Blake, Jeff Green somehow splashing 3s, and Joe Harris who Middleton shut down. KD was dropping 40 like it was nothing with PJ Tucker and Jrue on him. Nobody can do that but Durant. And who is beating the nets even without Kyrie when KD is playing that well?"
"He's probably talking about that Cavs team that had DWade, D Rose, Love, Isaiah Thomas, Jeff Green, Korver, JR and I believe Deron Williams too"
"With Nikola out, I’ve been watching more so to see if there is anything positive to take away from these games instead of watching for wins. The 3-point shooting of late has been encouraging. Monte and Jeff Green had good 3-point shooting games today and the last couple. AG has looked really, really good with an increased offensive load, which is something to watch when the big man comes back (18-7-4 on 63% from the field in the last 3 without Jokic). Free Zeke movement continues to build up steam with his great defense and his 3 point shooting has been good. With JMyke looking like a disaster on both ends, Nnaji might play himself into the backup 4/5 role soon. Hopefully, a lot of this stuff can carry over when Jokic returns and we can make a run. The hellish part of the month is over after Miami on Monday and a relatively soft schedule in the next couple of weeks despite 7 straight on the road."
"Jeff green didn’t touch him, but the other guy did hit his arm underneath"
"I often talk about the ""Hall of Very Good."" The logo is Thaddeus Young with Jeff Green in the Top 10. But Aaron Gordon doesn't even make that team. Instead he is in the Hall of ""Oh Yea, he was in the NBA"""
"Jeff Green, unfortunately."
They’re probably waiting for the post season to bust out the KD/Harden pick and roll. You could run it either way tbh. We used to run an inverted pnr with Jeff Green as the ball handler and Harden as the screener that was kinda successful.

"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills
"&gt; Top 100 in win shares, everyone else in top 100 is in hall of fame unless it's an active player  That's not true. There's a lot of players in the Top 100 who aren't in the HOF. Here's some examples. Laimbeer, AC Green, Jeff Hornacek, Otis Thorpe, Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Buck Williams, Horace Grant,  Terry Porter, Elton Brand, Larry Nance, Detlef Schrempf, Sam Perkins, Rasheed Wallace, Andre Miller and Eddie Jones."
"I normally can not stand either Van Grundy, but Stan had a great point during the Blazers/Nuggets game last night about Jeff Green and how are teams letting this man go when he still so productive. He was great in Hou 2 years ago, great for BK last season and was hooping last night."
James Johnson is like 70% of Jeff Green while Patty Mills is 1000% of Mike James
"Surely Monte Morris continues to start ahead of Campazzo for the foreseeable future. I would pair Morris and Rivers, and Campazzo and Hyland, as backcourt duos. I think what Dozier's injury does is now make Barton and probably Jeff Green spend more time at the 3 spot (a bit of a change for latter-day Green)."
How are Patty Mills and Jeff Green even remotely similar players?
jeff green literally shooting as bad as griff right now
nets gonna regret letting jeff green go.
I'd much rather start Jeff Green and let Monte run the bench than play Barton at the 3 again.
"Fair to chalk it off to shit luck with injuries. Making the conference finals when we weren't ever favourites to win the finals isn't terrible.  I could recount how if Tyler herro &amp; Iggy didn't play so well in game 6, maybe we would've made the finals or maybe if Jeff green missed for Cleveland but that's unproductive. They deserved it. Good for them.  Especially considering that of all of Hayward, Kyrie, Kemba, Morris &amp; Fournier, the only two to ever give us quality minutes in the playoffs were Morris &amp; Fournier. (I say quality minutes because kyrie was fit in 2019 &amp; so was Hayward barely and they, Kyrie especially, so shit against Milwaukee in the 2nd round 4-1 exit)."
"It is not like that bro  Jokic- Gordon- Barton- Murray- Monte  + 2 very talented kids Zeke and Bones + Jeff Green is not bad at all + thay will bring some new body before the end  That is dangerouse for anybody if Murray can be on even 80%  I didn' t count JMG, Facu, Cancar, Bol Bol, Rivers"

Jeff Green
Seeing Jeff green as the featured nuggets player in the thumbnail tells me everything I need to know about this game
This game is enough to get Jeff Green another minimum contract for the next two years.
"CAN I FUCKING CELEBRATE JEFF GREEN THO. I only have 2 guys left, and Uncle put up 24 points after pregaming at the assisted living home."
I hope Jeff Green comes back to the nuggets. Looks good on this team
Jeff Green has my highest watched minutes of all time.
I need to find someone to love me the way SVG loves Jeff Green
Jeff Green doesn’t deserve this kind of punishment.  Rough game game for him.
I thought he was talking about Jeff Green?
Who is Jeff Green??? Why does he only do 1 year stints with teams? Is he just trying to make the most of his NBA experience?
Jeff Green is the type of guy you tell the grand children about even though he's not one of the great NBA players of all time
At age 34 Jeff Green started nearly half the games last season. Not saying he is a bench guy but he I see more of role-playing gaurd who pops off every now and then
"I think a playmaking PG might be unnecessary because the offense revolves around giving the ball to one person and getting out of the way.  I think the best real life example was the Sixers team that made the finals. Even though Iverson was the SG the ball was pretty much just in his hands. That team just surrounded him with elite defenders who didn't care about being getting the ball. Eric Snow was the ideal PG since he really only needed to direct the offense if Iverson was likt triple teamed.  Of course this worked due to no zone defense so you'd probably need people like KCP, Danny and Jeff Green who can hit open threes."
The bad old players are retired. The ones that are left are obviously the good ones. Except Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson.
"If you think picking up Millsap's $30M team option gave the team the best chance to win, then idk what to tell you. That is just some insane bias.  &gt;No other notable free agent has come to Denver in a while.  The vast majority of NBA teams aren't frequently adding stars in free agency or something, this is just a serious victim complex to act like free agents uniquely hate Denver for some reason.  Jeff Green signed a 2/10 deal there this offseason, could have signed a couple Jeff green caliber players instead of paying a 34 year old role player $30M in 2019."

"Denver’s FO is horror. In 2019, they gave Millsap 30 million for 1 year, while his game and statistics were at the level of 7-8 million maximum. They are too emotional and soft when composing a roster they behave too empathetically. They have Jokic as the main organizer + Murray, Monte, Dozier on pg but they bring ultraundersized pg Facu--- unreal  Barton is a very injury pro, it's only a matter of time before he gets injured again. Barton literally doesn't have 2 good playoff games due to injuries, but they give him 16 million again  Plus they bring in and overpay a few more veterans who aren’t worth even 2-3 million  They let Hartenstein and McGee to bring Jeff Green to the position of reserve center with the height of the wings, chaos  After 2018, they were supposed to replace Millsap, Barton and Mason, that was half their budget-- and those players didn't even come close to justifying their contracts.   Jokic / Murray's deadly pick and roll gave them the illusion of everything. That brought them to the WCF, they misjudged everything.   Bringing Gordon has mitigated other bad assessments and contracts, although now all the bad assessments are coming to them. It’s so sad how badly they had trades and assessments  And then they rush unnecessarily with the max contract for Porter"
Great win and all thatbut something I took away again from the Nuggets is how Jeff Green is causing match up problems for the Suns right now.   The small ball five role is the biggest hole on the roster. Suns want McGee in drop but Green pops and then it becomes really rough on the point of attack defender to close off that pass and recover. Suns made some interesting adjustments to it but hard to really judge when they were up big most of the game and it becomes a lot more deadly for Denver if Murray is the ball handler.   I hope the Suns can leave San Antonio tomorrow with Thad Young because that would help solve that problem.
"Nah, I’ve watched him since day one. He has cold stretches but I wouldn’t say that’s inconsistent. He isn’t like Terrence Ross or Jeff Green or Andrew Wiggins who look like prime MJ one day and then look like a fan stumbled out on the court the next."
"the bucks had a 105 offensive rating that series. that isnt good at all. bucks offense was bad that series their defense kept them alive mostly because nets were missing kyrie, harden, aldridge, and jeff green for large parts of that series."
Thought that was Jeff Green
Derrick Williams and Jeff Green were both awesome for us. A new Mini Lebron every season!
Cant believe that team went to the finals off a jeff green scoring explosion
Jeff Green has been horrible in just about every advanced stat I can find
"and even that team had some really good roleplayers who went on to play well elsewhere: Crowder, Clarkson, Hill, Nance, Rose, Jeff Green..."
Jeff green
"&gt; LBJ has to take the blame.  lmao he'll happily take the blame. People on this sub have such a weird perspective about player empowerment. Lebron spent the first 7 years of career stuck without any means to control his career/destiny, Cleveland wasted that. He learned his lesson and made sure every single following move in his career/team was largely dictated by him. He made 9 finals off that and won 4 championships.   Bron took the blame for firing Blatt and ended up pulling off the greatest upset title in NBA history, he took the blame for Kyrie requesting a trade and still made the finals with Jeff Green as his next best player in 2018 when Love went down. He took the blame when he traded all the Lakers talent to get AD.   And he'll happily take the blame now, he wouldn't have it the other way, and for good reason."
"I’m sorry... Jeff Green is still in the NBA, and starting?  Dude played for the SuperSonics"
Tony Bradley vs Jeff Green. A big man duel for the ages
"The Jeff Green experience: One night, a goose egg; the next night, 20 pts on high efficiency."
"we all was jeff green fans at one point, no shame in that"
I used to be a big Jeff Green fan back in the day
rudy gay is like jeff green if jeff green was good and not a complete mirage
"Needs to be with the Say Ahh crew. KD, Harden, and Jeff Green together are an all-time trio"
I hope it goes better than Ed Davis and Jeff Green. Those were Mike's guys too and they both failed here.
Jeff Green almost got the all 0's stat line
Jeff Green in peak Celtics form
Welcome to the Jeff Green experience
Jeff Green with 0/0/1 in 23 minutes
I’m such a dumbass I really thought Jeff green signed with you guys and not Denver
"KD took the Bucks to 7 games despite   - Harden missing 4 games with a injury. Then coming back at 20%.  getting hurt with grade 2  hamstring strain 45 seconds on GAME 1. That injury takes months to recover from. Harden came back in 1.5 weeks  - missing multiple PGs. Dinwiddie  ACL tear 3rd game of the year. Kyrie ankle injury.    - Joe Harris led the NBA  in 3pt percentage at 45%. Vs the Bucks, he  shot worse than Giannis  - Jeff Green missing 4 games. CHECK back game 5."
"Gordon took too many shots, bones got cocky, Morris didn't look for any shots despite being the third option, Jeff green did absolutely nothing, jamychal was okish in limited minutes, and rivers fumbled a great jokic pass"
Hey hey 2018 Jeff Green was either the best or second best non LeBron cav in that playoff run (especially against the Celts).
This is the quintessential Jeff Green experience. When you have expectations for him he’s terrible and when he has no expectations he’s a great role player.
Tony Snell ran so Jeff Green could stumble. Unfortunate he grabbed the board.
"Jeff Green with 0 points in 23 minutes, can’t say I’m surprised"
Jeff Green played 23 minutes and he only has a rebound to show for it
This dude Jeff Green went to work for 23 minutes and got zero points  Out here doing cardio in the middle of an NBA game
Jeff Green was sitting at home after getting cut by the Jazz until Harden revived him. I think he finally got more than a minimum this year.
"I kinda am, he'd be a massive upgrade over Jeff green lol."
Those are good picks.  They made a mistake by letting Jeff Green go.
"1. It was an inch from conference finals, not finals. 2. It was only because they already had two wins in the series before kyrie went down. If it was that way from the start bucks win in 5.  3. They also lost jeff green who was an impact player for them.  This isnt even close to the same team right now."
"Yeah, no wonder, we have Murray, MPJ and now Barton out. Surprisingly Campazzo, Austin Rivers and Jeff Green don’t shoot as well"
"&gt;	But if I’m an OKC fan, I’d be so fucked off. Horford was about to sign with them if KD stayed.  Eh 🤷🏾‍♂️ I’m a fan of basketball way before I’m a Thunder fan, and I understand the competitive standpoint, but in a vacuum I loved seeing that brand of ball in GSW. I really only had hate for GSW in 2016, and never for KD. We will probably never get to see that ball again at THAT level.  There are ppl who have told me they would run him over if they saw him crossing the street, like wtf. I understand, damn near every time I talk basketball with an OKC fan, that I am an anomaly in my feelings 😂. Don’t even get me started on my feeling toward Russ (as a winning player)  Edit: I’ll take Russ, Harden, KD, Jeff Green, and Ibaka over that lineup 10/10. But that’s another story for another day"
He’s always just been Jeff Green with better media coverage
"The Nets do miss Jeff Green, but FIBA Patty was such a great pick up for them."
"Issue is offensively. Aside from the elephant in the room, they really miss Jeff Green and Blake looks washed this year. LA coming back really really helped"
"Probably either Jeff or Jamychal Green, depending if you want to go big or small."
"It’s like when people get drunk and order random shit on Amazon, he’s gonna get wine drunk and trade half the team.  *Wakes up*  *Reads Headline*  “Lakers pull off 10-team trade to acquire Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, (the other) Brooks, James Johnson, Tyler Herro, and Andre Drummond (again). Enough to convince DWade to come out of retirement and join the Lakers.”  “Who the fu-… Did I…?”"
"Might be Jeff Green, cant think of anyone either but that's still solid  Not Grayson"
"Grizzlies used to have a bomb ass ex team. But still have Conley, Lowry, Gay, JV. Torn on who the 5th would be. Not Jeff Green, not Grayson, I dunno."
"The bench is Bruce Brown,TLC,Shamet,Jeff Green and an as of yet unsigned Vet big.(Nets have 3 open roster spots atm)   Thats 3 dudes who were starters last year and TLC. That doesn't sound like a bench thats a problem to me. And that's before you factor in Spence possibly coming back for the playoffs"
"Who gonna build the wall on the nets? Laundry Shamet and Jeff Green? As currently constructed, the Bucks would sweep the nets assuming Middletown shows up"
"Forgot about Joe Harris, but I still like the construction of the 76ers team better assuming they give up Simmons, Maxey, and Thybulle plus picks for Harden. The Nets team has a better offense, but are way worse defensively. As for Dwight, I'd take him over both Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan. He played good minutes for the Lakers during the playoffs. DeAndre Jordan is pretty washed up imo and only reason why he's still on the team is because he's friend with Kyrie and KD. Jeff Green is pretty limited as a player. Beyond that the rest of the team is pretty thin especially with Dinwiddie out."
Jeff Green
"You mention Seth, Danny Green, Milton and Dwight as part of the Sixers core but for the Nets Joe Harris is a G leaguer?? And is Dwight even better than Jeff Green or DeAndre Jordan at this point?"
Better finals performances vs million times better competition while being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and  green instead of Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec. God what a joke   It is what it is   Jordan on the 2007 and 2018 cavs teams = lottery not finals
"They still have Jeff Green, Shamet, Bruce Brown, and Dwinwiddie when he comes back next year. Will also be a buyout / vet min destination and have the TP-MLE"
Yeah Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan will defitenly figure out Giannis in the playoffs..
"Stopped by Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Bam Adabayo, and Jae Crowder vs stopped by Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan"
Let's actually go through it: Big 3 + Harris.   Then: DeAndre is serviceable as a big (if they don't get Dedmon)          Shamet is fine as a rotation guy          TLC totally fine as a guy coming off the bench           Same with Jeff Green giving you 13-17 minutes  They can also stagger the Big 3 to play alongside those bench guys.  They also have available open roster spots. 3 to be exact.
"You put Giannis up against elite defenders like Bam, Gasol, Kawhi, and Crowder and he crumbles. That’s a far cry from washed Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green"
"&gt; Their strategy of leaving people open for three isn't going to work against the Nets though lmao  That's usually because of the bigs that can pop since Brook can't step up and drop fast enough. And if Joe Harris or Jeff Green beats them instead of the big trio, that's a win for the Bucks defense I'd say.  On the other hand, idk whose lifeforce Nets will drain to get DeAndre to play 30+ meaningful minutes."
"Well on the plus side for them, they're going to be preeminent favorite to get whoever is bought out because they have playing time and open roster spots up for grabs.   I think your team is the only one that stands a chance because of Embiid, however I'm not sure you have enough perimeter scoring from the likes of Seth Curry/Shake/Maxey/Tobias to win 4 out of 7 vs. this team.   Like Jeff Green, for all his notable flaws as a player, isn't actually THAT bad as a man defender, he did a very good job on Giannis in their game last year in the bubble, and if you look at how much Crowder gave Giannis trouble, you can imagine Jeff Green being able to pose the same problem.   When push comes to shove at the end of games, they are probably going to switch 1-5, which is why they probably need one more 3&amp;D wing as Joe Harris is probably too much of a defensive liability on quick guards. However, I won't put it past them to get like, a Trevor Ariza, or somebody of that ilk."
"Starting 5: Kyrie/Harden/Harris/KD/DJ  Bench: Bruce Brown/Shamet/TLC/Jeff Green  Closing 5: Kyrie/Harden/Harris/KD/Jeff Green (LOL) &lt;-- this lineup is hilariously unstoppable and hilariously bad on defense  Nash and MDA really are the perfect coaches for this team, they always like to test the limits of how far offense and small-ball can go."
"No doubt, will be a completely different look. I could see KD coming off a lot of screens. Could also see him as a partner to Harden PnR and pick and pop.      Another thing that Houston did was kind of an inverted pick and pop, where Harden would screen for a driving Jeff Green then pop to the top of the key. If the defense helped on the drive it left Harden open for a kick out 3. Replace Jeff Green with KD and that play becomes even harder to defend"
"They have all 3 guys signed till 2022-23 when their player option kicks in. I think they have a good shot to make the finals on talent alone but their depth is a massive concern, especially in the front court. Relying on a washed DJ and Jeff Green to guard some of the bigs they'll run into is a terrifying proposition. Not to mention that KD is really going to have to guard high profile players on a nightly basis like Tatum, Bron, Kawhi, Gianni's, etc. That's a lot to ask a guy who's coming off an ACL injury  I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to add some depth at some point to round out the edges."
Jeff Green
"so you really think that jeff green, austin rivers, ben mclemore, danuel house, etcetc are better than Jrue Holiday, pLaYoFf RoNdO, Boogie, etc?  &amp;#x200B;  or that harden shoulda been able to do more with an injured russ or an injured cp3? lmao harden did way more for the rockets than AD did for the pelicans"
DeAndre Jordan or Jeff Green when we go small. Give our rookie Reggie Perry some run. Hopefully sign Dedmon.  DeAndre's only skill nowadays is setting monster screens and tapping out o-rebounds haha
"Yea I understand that the Heat and Raptors personnel is vastly superior defensively to the Nets, but I disagree that the biggest part is about the initial defender, I think it's more about the scheme. Jeff Green and KD aren't top tier defenders, but it's still gonna be 2 almost 7 footers double teaming you.  And imo, if we do get matched up with the Bucks in a playoff series and the Nets don't have any big acquisitions I think the best bet is to try and emulate the 2011 Mavs defense on LeBron. Have a guy like TLC, who's long and fast, but skinny as fuck defend Giannis and have him flop like a fish and see if the refs call offensive fouls. Dare him to shoot open jumpers, and double/triple team him every time he sets foot into the paint. If refs aren't calling offensive fouls guard him with a bigger body like Jeff Green."
"I think he did what he could without a reliable jumper and playing a defense where 2 guys come help to defend him every drive.  I understand that the Nets don’t have good defenders but why couldn’t they also just make a wall... they’re not premiere defenders but I’m pretty sure DJ, Jeff Green, and KD have the knowledge and ability to make a wall every time Giannis drives and force other Bucks to beat us. Pretty sure a lot of the walls the Heat made to stop Giannis were comprised of Hero and Robinson helping who aren’t the best defenders.  Also the one game where the Heat kinda strayed away from the wall strategy Giannis scored 19 in 11 minutes haha"
He would've done more than Jeff Green lol
"But will they get a center? Dan Tony and Harden already went a season without a true center, and they have Jeff Green. Personally I think they should go after Dwight. Would be entertaining."
"Their depth isn’t that bad though.  Kyrie/Harden/KD/Green/Jordan is an outstanding starting 5.  Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan are weaker starters, but decent vet role players, and the big 3 is insane.  Joe Harris is a good 6th man.  And then other guys like Shamet, TLC, Bruce Brown, etc. are decent bench players.  Also, I’m sure they get the odd buyout ring chaser as the season goes on.  Off-court stuff is a big risk.  Kyrie is a complete wildcard, and KD and Harden are both primadonnas.  But if they can keep the locker room functional, and stay healthy, I think they’re strong championship contenders this year, and even stronger next year, with an offseason to stock up on ring chasers."
Yeah huh I was thinking of the 7th game of the season. The Jeff Green corner 3. IDK why I've always remembered that as opening night. Should have known better too. The NBA would never give that Celtics team a premier matchup on opening night.
"No, they didn't tank. They had that one year where they missed the playoffs, but it was lack of talent stemming from the big trade and not an effort to gut the team. a tanking team would have gotten rid of Jeff Green in a separate trade or played their 1st rounder (Olynyk) more.  in fact, there was criticism that they were trying too hard to win in the short-term. they passed on Giannis in the draft (really raw, with a low floor and high upside) for Olynyk, who had a high floor and low ceiling. the criticism at the time was that a team that wasn't going to win any time soon should be taking a big swing on someone like Giannis rather than drafting a guy who projected to have a solid, 10-year career."
"Trading Rondo and Jeff Green at the deadline in '14 was 100% a tank move. They were around the 7th 8th pick iirc and that move was clearly a bottom out and get a top 5 pick move.  But Ainge had always been high on IT and couldn't pass up getting him for a pick projected in the 25-30 range.   I remember after a little win streak, Crowder apologized to the FO if they were trying to tank but he only knows how to play one way or something like that."
Our depth is fine it's our big man rotation that's ass. We still have Joe Harris Jeff green tlc Bruce brown shamet. Those are decent players to have around 3 stars.
Good luck guarding Giannis and AD with Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green being your 5th best player
Jeff Green aka most important player on the Brooklyn Nets
Jeff Green is the starting center?  Yikes.
Is so great to see Durant and Jeff Green reunited...
Why would he do that over KD and/or Jeff Green?
No but Jeff Green can.
He said the same thing about Jeff Green too
AND Jeff Green ....
"I don't even think their bench is that bad honestly except at the 5 spot.  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown / Chris Chiozza   SG: Harden / Shamet / Tyler Johnson   SF: Harris / TLC  PF: Durant / Jeff Green   C: DeAndre Jordan / Nic Claxton  With Kyrie being out, they have a bit of backcourt flexibility which is nice. Their center depth is atrocious though. Get Whiteside for a second rounder or something."
"Look. I like Deandre. But he averaged 18 mpg last year. Having him starting just plain isn't ideal. He isn't near as good as he used to be. Calling the others playoff rotation good is stretching it personally. Especially the bench. Losing Allen and Levert is seriously going to affect their play. Secondly, you do know Jeff Green is 34 right? Finally, lets say they get unlucky and pull the sixers in the playoffs. Defensively, what are you going to do against Embiid?"
"I agree, the starting 5 is gnarly but then their best bench player is like a 34 year old Jeff Green. They just seem too top heavy to win. Also who is going to be the clear vocal leader (and by that I also mean the defensive leader) of that team? Chemistry can trump talent... just look at Denver LA this past year"
"Don't forget.... Jeff Green played for OKC,HOU and now Brooklyn."
DJ did well today.  He still has a playoff or 2 run in him..  Bruce Brown is good &amp; Jeff Green can hold his own.  Would like to see a Kyrie/Harden/Green/KD/DJ lineup.    Nets also have some exceptions where they can sign a big or veteran SF.    Marks isn’t oblivious to their roster.  He’s a top 5 GM in the league. They’re not done making moves yet...
TLC and Jeff Green first team defense so I’m leaning no.
Can he score on TLC or Jeff Green tho????
Jeff Green and Bruce Brown
If Jeff Green wins MVP this year it can be 14 out of 14!
"At wing/guard I’m still ok with our depth. After our big 3 we have Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Jeff Green, plus Shamet and Tyler Johnson that are playable, and Chiozza who is decent but severely limited by his size.   Unless Perry (and Claxton when he comes back from injury) seriously surprise us though, our center situation is FUCKED. Nets will probably be looking to find a starting caliber center somehow before the deadline if they wanna contend this year.   Next year a FA or two, plus getting Dinwiddie back (I think we’ll have to re-sign him but with bird rights), will be the year we really go all in."
"Don't sleep on Jeff Green, he could win MVP one of these years. Then KD will have had an MVP every season"
"Jeff Green, TLC, and Brown are all solid players that deserve bench minutes on a contender. Shamet has to find his stroke from deep again, but if he does then he’s in the same boat. Tyler Johnson, Chiozza, and Perry are all lower end but have still been a net positive when on the court, but could use upgrading if possible obviously. Claxton looked good in what few minutes we’ve seen in his young career, but he’s been hurt all season so far.   The huge hole is at center, where we now have to start a fairly washed DJ. He has moments where he looks focused and motivated still, but that’s more match up dependent than anything as he can’t guard floor spacers for shit.   If we get a solid starter level center somehow, I’m happy with the depth (esp when we get Dinwiddie back, but that won’t be till next season). And if we do get that center, then I’m definitely ok with the depth considering the ridiculous talent on the starting five, which can have staggered minutes to help them along.   After the center, highest priority is to get another wing defender. But we can contend without adding one. I don’t think we can truly contend without grabbing a center, though."
This is a good offensive team. But not on defense. Who even is their second best defender on that team? 32 year old DJ? or 34 year old Jeff Green?
I would actually bet money on this but I'll wait to even see if they're a viable contender first. There's no way they're beating the Lakers in a 7 game series. AD alone would average 40 a game being guarded by old man Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green. Hell I think the Clippers would beat them too.
Jeff Green
Jeff Green
It worked for teams with Kawhi and Gasol and Siakam and Butler and Iggy and Bam. It’s not going to work for Joe Harris and Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan
I mean even Uncle Jeff Green is already there too!
"Nah, he played that for Warriors. Jeff Green also has played there a few times. It would be a team effort."
Big four if you add Jeff Green lol
our bench wont even be that bad   Joe Harris or Bruce Brown/Shamet/Jeff Green/TLC/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton (when healthy)/Reggie Perry/Chiozza   will probably sign a few more players to fill it out
He set a ton of screens for Jeff green in the playoffs
Because Jeff Green stands a chance against Embiid
"Lowkey would love to see KD at center. Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Jeff Green, KD would be fireworks."
"Guard defense doesn’t matter much when you have a elite backline. The Nets have Deandre Jordan and Jeff Green....who tf is guarding the paint for them?  KD is then going to have to be your main help defender at the rim, which means whatever wing he’s guarding is going to be open very often. And since they don’t have other elite wing defenders he basically will be guarding the opposing team’s best wing lol. This is going to end up a swiss cheese defense - they’re going to struggle guarding dribble penetration and won’t have anyone at the rim as backup."
Ben McLemore is one of those players where if you knew nothing about the NBA and you watched his highlights you'd think he was a superstar  Same with players like Rudy Gay and Jeff Green
They should run a switch everything scheme. KD and Harden are both good at it and you could run Jeff green at center to close games
Nah Jordan will be playing 25 min max or he gone need a stretcher to leave. Embiids gonna be feasting on their back up center Jeff Green😭
"I think a lot of people will change their mind about this Nets team in 40 games. Yeah, they aren’t a perfect team, but offensively they have 3 players that can give you an efficient 30pts every night and then they have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Shamet, TLC... This is with Spencer being out injured.        This is a team with MDA as an assistant coach, they have the potential of being one of the best offenses we have ever seen."
"By gawd, that’s Jeff Green music."
Jeff Green also on the team to add to the nostalgia.
The question mark wasn't meant to imply that OP didn't know if Draymond was better than 34 year old Jeff Green. The question mark was because no one knows who is going to be the starting power forward on the Nets now that their depth is gone
I'd say Jeff Green or Chris Chorizo.   I just hate how the BK court looks on TV
"Draymond &gt;&gt; Jeff Green if you take intangibles into account (things like locker room, defensive presence, etc.)"
No lol  Curry &gt; Kyrie  Klay &lt; Harden  2017 KD &gt; 2020 KD  Draymond Green &gt; Jeff Green? lol  Zaza/McGee/Jones = Jordan
They already have Jeff Green again too
They already have Jeff Green again too
Also important to remember that 48 year old Jeff Green is now the Nets 5th best player.
Yeah I don’t know about that man. If the best player off my bench was 34 year old Jeff green or TLC I’d be pretty concerned
Jeff Green a real G
"Man, Jeff Green has been one of the best role players of the past decade"
"Don’t forget Jeff Green is on the squad, too. All they need to do now is trade DeAndre back to the Clippers for Ibaka, and you have the 2011 OKC Thunder."
"Depth is overrated for playoffs, all you need is 3 great guys and like 4 average dudes  They have 3 all nba players, Harris is good, DeAndre is pretty ass but meh i mean he can play 20 minutes, Jeff Green can get you 15 minutes of good play, TLC looks okay   So they have that plus the 3 open roster spots with DPE and tax ML"
"Our center rotation isn’t much better, to a greater extent considering that Jeff green is our only true (using that lightly) PF. We’re gonna be in trouble with any big we play"
"The Nets have a better bench than people are giving them credit for. Harris is an elite shooter, Jeff Green is still a versatile and solid role player, Shamat is decent, Bruce Brown is a decent young player, and DJ is at worst as good as Javale was last year. They will also be a popular buy out destination"
Future MVP Jeff Green of the 07-08 SuperSonics would like a word... *tucks away sports almanac 2042*
"Hey have no bench, kyrie may sit the season out and Jeff Green is a liability."
Why do players like Jeff Green just get nice against us
"i mean, at this point their best defenders are KD, Jeff green, and a washed deandre. it’s not too inconceivable, unless they pull some bullshit where they use their stars’ offense to tire out the opposing team and make them play bad on offense in some 6d eels and escalators move"
"People claim we have ""no depht"" yet Bruce Brown is incredible, Jeff Green is good and so is TLC. We need a backup center and our bench will be better than 60% of the leagues bench."
"Somewhere, Jeff Green is shaking his head at this."
"Kyrie, Harden, Joe harris, durant, Jeff green..tell me a better starting five! Bench with shamet, TLC, Jordan, Bruce brown. Its a decent bench. The lack of defense is the problema i see."
"honestly this team looks more than deep enough everywhere except at center. if they pick up a big stiff or two they will be fine, just play jeff green (or even durant) at 5 in the playoffs when they need to and give deandre a few minutes this team is STACKED"
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Funny thing is jeff green already playing for brooklyn lol
Get jeff green and nick collison comes out of retirement to form exodia
They aren't winning shit until they figure out that defense.  Who is stopping LeBron and AD?  Joe Harris and Jeff Green?  DJ is old as dirt. KD might be their best defender.
"Cuz that offense is likely going to be a pain in the ass for every team to deal with. 3 guys in the top 20 with two of them likely in the top 5 of players in the league? That’s scary stuff man. Their defense is a legitimate concern, cuz atm they don’t really have options to check the the tandem of LeBron/AD, or Giannis, or Embiid for example because Deandre is their center, I guess along with Jeff Green (which isn’t good enough to remotely slow down the names I gave).  There’s still the buyout market and Nets will have plenty of space to spend on making their team better. Plenty of time before playoffs too. Personally I think this team is gonna be quite troublesome for many teams, but I do think how much they improve their defense is a big factor in if they’ll win or not. Just have to wait and see"
Don't forget Jeff Green
"Bruce Brown is an elite win defender, Jeff Green literally started for us for a lot of games, TLC is solid. The Nets bench is still better than the Celtics bench."
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Plus now our back up C is Jeff Green.
"I honestly hate this trade. We gave up two perfectly good pieces for what? Sure Harden is one of the best players on the planet, but it doesn't make up for losing our frontcourt. Allen was playing leagues better than DJ. Plus LeVert was such a great piece at getting plays going when neither of our stars were on the floor. At least we finally got rid of Prince. But what is gonna happen with our frontcourt. We can't play KD for all the minutes at the 4 every game. And DJ ain't gonna cut it. Jeff Green better be able to play big at 6.8 (but he ain't no Draymond). I hope we get better with this trade, at least when Kyrie and Harden aren't clubbing together while COVID is showing its ugly head still."
"What if the Nets go small tho?? Jeff Green at center and put Embiid on an island defensively?? Sure Embiid scores every time, but so do the Nets and 2&lt;3  Just an idea I'm throwing out there, this could work or just be a disaster."
Jeff Green
"Yeah it was an issue but with Kris Dunn on the floor i think it wouldnt be as big of an issue.  In the 4th maybe but Hawks I bet would run with a Trae, Dunn, Reddish, Hunter, JC lineup that would be more than decent.  We lost in large part because Capela was gassed and couldnt keep up with Jeff Green offensively.  Think this lineup solves for that and makes trae less of an issue."
Jeff Green: 8.3 on 54.7/43.9/85.7
"2018 Cavs  DRose, Kyrie, Deron, Isaiah, Calderon DWade, JR, Clarkson, Hood, Shump Bron, Korver, Crowder, Jeff Green Love, Thompson, Frye, Nance Perkins  I mean that team can run any kind of lineup and pretty much matchup with anyone"
"Yeah.  He's not horrific, but any stretch 5 will absolutely destroy us with his cement feet.  For now, I do like playing small with Jeff Green since that makes the offense even more ridiculous and allows them to switch on defense."
No doubt the Russ trade fucked y'all but he's doing most of this with Jeff Green at the 5 who y'all had last year.
Jeff Green
"Cavs had Lebron, Wade, Rose, Love and IT in 2017-18 with Jeff Green, Korver and JR Smith"
"Also Jeff Green, Avery Bradly, Nate Robinson, Perkins, Delonte West off the bench."
"OMG good point. KG, Pierce, Allen, Shaq, Rondo, Jeff Green, Avery Bradly, Perkins, Big Baby Davis, Nate Robinson, Delonte West, Jermaine O'Neal."
I think that going from current barely-an-NBA-player DeAndre Jordan to peak Clippers DeAndre Jordan would be such a massive improvement that it would be the Nets. The current defense and rebounding weakness they have would be largely erased. They'd also get Heat Tyler Johnson and whatever the best version of Jeff Green was.   The 2013-2014 Nets could be another answer for the second question.  Deron Williams/Shaun Livingston   Joe Johnson/Jason Terry   Paul Pierce/Andrei Kirilenko   Kevin Garnett/Mirza Teletovic   Brook Lopez/Mason Plumlee
"Harden, KD, and Jeff Green got next"
Jeff Green is still looking great this year reunited with Harden.   The dribble dribble shoot guy has made a habit of feeding the shit out of shooters while being labeled selfish.
Jeff Green and big centre
A second rounder should get it done but peope seriously expect too much from McGee. DJ and McGee aren't going to be good for 48 minutes combined come playoff time. They'll need more wing depth to slide Jeff Green down to pick up as many as 20MPG as a C. I don't think it's as much of a no brainer as it's made out to be unless KD and Kyrie are okay with DJ being used as salary filler for a C to complement McGee.
jeff green?
Dude Jeff green plays the 5 so does dray in spurts. Collins Is not a full time center and would not work with dray. 18% lmao
"im still upset presti traded ray allen for jeff green we could of had kd, russ, and ray allen"
"idk if it’s laziness, but they seem to take possessions more seriously and usually run small ball lineups w jeff green at center for more switchability to close out games"
"And someone who's been on a shitton of teams, Jeff Green? Solomon Hill? Ed Davis?"
The good: nets big three looks great. James harden is an amazing facilitator. He is the quintessential scoring machine point guard. Harden is doing great in his role. Kyrie had some beautiful circus shots. KD is a bad man. Jeff Green is alive and a great small ball center.   The bad: DeAndre is showing his age. We need better low post defense. This team needs to stop giving me a heart attack in the Fourth Quarter/OT. Trae is a bad man who flops too much.
Jeff green
Jeff Foster cheap shot on Derrick Rose 1  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lynrCDw3W6A  Jeff Foster tries to injure Derrick Rose in the air  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TKZcnkIQxY  Lebron James steps on Draymond Green  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrBgdV1wy_Q  Dwight Howard concusses Jimmy Butler with a cheap shot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQI1vlulm0I
"Yes, but with Jeff Green they were playing 5-out and Capela would be taken out of the paint is more what I’m getting at.   Nets are just a tough matchup for traditional centers when they go small like that."
"I mean, to be fair Capela would be completely ineffective on defense with Jeff green standing on the perimeter and KD, Harden and Kyrie doing their thing."
"Seems like a coin is flipped every time Jeff Green joins a new team, heads he's good and tails he's bad. So far Nets got heads."
Jeff Green is playing out of his god damn mind this season. A career 44% shooter is shooting 56% from the field. And 48% from three!
Didnt expect Jeff Green to be the guy to bury us. Oh well
Give Jeff Green a fucking award
"sorry but why is jeff green shooting 3s in crunch time with Durant, Harden, and Irving on the floor"
JEFF GREEN AGAIN!!!
JEFF GREEN AGAIN HOLY SHIT  (Also that was a great pocket pass by Harden - go figure)
JEFF GREEN!
"Bro, DeAndre is literally unplayable against any stretch 4-5. He will not get out of the paint, dude.   Just bring out Jeff Green."
Jeff Green was more valuable to the team than Kevin Love
"In playoffs, the only good role players were Jeff Green, Kyle Korver, George Hill and Larry Nance."
"Jeff Green, Korver, George Hill, and Thompson were good. Love and JR only showed up against the Raptors and were terrible outside of that, Hood got benched cus he threw a temper tantrum, and Clarkson was irredeemable dogshit awful"
"this is very role dependent  like George Hill for that dude who could bring the ball up, get it to lebron, spot up, he was good   JR obviously fucked up in game 1 of the finals, but he was fine in his role, not as good prior years, but fine for his role   i thought K.Love played awful  Korver for his role was good   Larry Nance and Tristan i thought were solid   Hood, Clarkson were big yikes   jeff green was ok.."
"George Hill was pretty useful until his finals choke, game 7 against Indy, when Lebron was on the bench the Hill/Love PNR gave them a  big boost.  Jeff Green was huge in the game 7 against Boston.  Korver was good too.  Love wasn't good but wasn't a drag either."
Jeff Green was pretty good that year
Jeff Green was a great pickup that year
"I mean for this year that's 1 if and in Hardens mind him and Durant and Kyrie is enough to better than HOU even if HOU has 3-4 of those ifs come true.  Drummond seeking a buyout should be enough to consider that there will be quality players seeking out and BKN will probably be at the top of the list for those players this year. Jeff Green is a valuable depth piece for BKN and he resurrected his life in the NBA off the back of buyouts.    PG is better than anyone HOU had to pair w/ Harden. Is this the time when you make the argument Leonard is better than Lebron because Lebron has always had a clear #2 on his title teams? Leonard himself went to form his version of a super team after the TOR run because everyone in the NBA knows while runs like that happen ala Dirk Mavs, they are the exception not the rule."
"That finals run is probably the biggest carry job of all time. His best teammates was an out of his prime K Love. Jeff Green, JR Smith, etc were ok role players."
The east was just atrocious that year. That bucks team wasn’t that good either and the sixers were led by a rookie in simmons  and embiid in his second year playing  The Cavs team outside of Lebron was awful. Next best guy was Kevin love and then third best guy was Jeff green?
"I agree but this game definitely felt like an outlier. No way he'll be tied in attempts with the likes of Jeff Green on the regular, and the 3s will drop sooner than later once hes acclimated. He'll likely get settled around ~15fga average with games he gets cooking sprinkled in here and there. The sample is way too small of course but less volume with an increase in efficiency is what I'm expecting. This situation hes in is already crazy entertaining, it's gonna be nuts once he strikes a balance between the overly passive game we saw today, and the aggressiveness we know he can bring when want/need."
Jeff Green and they kept attacking this matchup
"Not really? Joe Harris is elite and Jeff green is solid, Deandre jordan is a backup at best but I gurantee they find help before the playoffs."
"Lmfao what, calm down buddy you’re not on some complete different level of intellect when it comes to basketball.  I don’t know what youre even going on about, skip to 1:15 and you’ll see Sexton hitting a smothered three in Kyries face to send it to overtime, another pull up 3 in his face, and out of control fade away mid range, and back to back stepbacks over 7 foot KD and 6’9 Jeff green. I never said the nets aren’t a bad defense, they definitely are, but there’s not much they could have done in that overtime, Sexton just went crazy.  “Casual take” my ass. You’re not some basketball expert because you watched one coach nick video, calm down you’re not special lmao  https://youtu.be/NqqHhvCs5lc"
"I get that, but my point is that although there may be chemistry issues at the start and learning to gel together, the Heat still had the elite defenders that allowed them to be one of the best defensive teams in the NBA. The Nets don’t have that, like at all. They’ll have to be able to have impeccable rotations and communications on the defensive end to be a good defensive team, and even at that, the other team’s star player will still most likely go off due to the lack of a lockdown. Not to mention the obvious lack of experience outside the big three and Jeff Green."
Exactly what I was thinking if you have Jeff Green covering Embiid for a series Joel gonna average 50
"Yeah it was just the poor overall defense lol, but seriously Jeff Green tried his best so I give him credit for that. Bam definitely made tough shots"
They did jeff green dirty lol. they weren't even doubling bam they just left green on him.
"As of now no, it’s clear they need another defensive wing and center. They have DeAndre Jordan and Jeff Green serving as their centers, that isn’t good enough to be a good defense.   But they will address those issues and be much better defensively. All they need to do is become an average defense to get to the next level."
"Not an outlier, they have to play Jeff Green at C for large portions of their game and it's their closing lineup. Offense is tough to stop though"
you are an actual idiot if you thing Jeff green is significantly shorter than bam
Duncan hits even two more threes and it’s a different ball game. Nets have two wins against a miserable shooting night by Milwaukee and a Miami team without Jimmy or Herro.   Bam needed to take it right at Jeff Green the last couple times he had it on the block.
"Jeff Green is listed at 6'8""   Bam is listed at 6'9"""
they're guarding adebayo with jeff green. this is to be expected.
Jeff Green is 34 years old
uhhh yea dragic Id much rather you leave jeff green wide open than KD lol
&gt;	Nets best defender (considering who’s on the floor in the clutch) might be Harden or Jeff green.  No KD?
Jeff Green and Joe Harris are the Splash brothers lol
"It's unlikely to happen, but I really want to see a Clippers - Nets finals.   First off, the offense in that series would be absolutely ridiculous, they are 1 and 2 in eFG% by a lot.   Then, we'd finally get the battle of Kawhi vs. KD, which we've not really had since 2016 and Kawhi wasn't Kawhi yet then, and 2017 was ruined by Zaza, and 2019 was ruined by KD's Achilles.   Pat Bev trying to lock up Kyrie and them going at each other would be funny.   Also so many former OKC players in that series, by my count, at least 5 with KD, Harden, Serge, Jeff Green, and Reggie Jackson."
"Joe Harris. Their other guy is non-existent right now, unless you want Jeff Green."
Jeff Green too
Jeff green alwyas quietly good wonder why he can’t get more than the min
"Yeah, we ended up with Barnes who was decent but not preferably starting caliber, Wes Johnson who was awful, Jeff Green who was inconsistent, and Danny Granger past his prime. Just was never quite enough to put us over the hill."
"nets got kyrie, jeff green, kd and joe harris"
You know our only forwards right now KD and Jeff Green. They both on the older side. We need another forward no matter how bad the d is
It's either make a trade or you put Jeff Green at the 5 and go small and hope you win games 130-128
"&gt; Million dollar head coach for a team that always has one of the best records in the league, refuses to use a certain type of play.....hmm   yeah you haven't watched a lot of Bucks basketball over the last few years. Bud cooked up a great offensive system 2years ago and has barely changed it. Bottom line is Bud is stubborn and always has been even in Atlanta. His failure to do something new on offense and defense has always been what's held he team back.   Not saying All our disappointments have all been his fault (bledsoe shrinking, role players not being able to hit a single 3) but a good chunk of it has been him. Also statistically the Khris/Giannis pnr has been great and why your allstar level guard Jrue only has a usage rate of 19% are all things a coach has to change. When you have Giannis of Jeff Green instead of KD that's a coaching decision. And choosing not to use a top 3 finisher who's 6'11'' in a pnr is something that should be a no brainer especially since you have 2 other great ball handlers is also just bad coaching"
Russ was picked and technically had a jersey. uhh... trade Harden for Jeff Green and the spirit of Ray Allen?
"...So is Harris the one that's going to end up shipped away for a big, or does Jeff Green still carry enough value?"
"they might be, if he were willing to be Manu, he could get the same minutes and they'd be able to have Jeff Green and Joe Harris as solid defenders to balance it out; but he wasn't ready to be LeBrons Robin, much less Alfred off the bench lol he's starting and getting his minutes either way. they might be better but it's never gonna happen so it doesn't matter. they'll just be going back and forth between green and harris all season and hoping for the best, unless they decide to put green at the 5 over DJ."
"Such a good point. His agent’s name is Jason Glushon and the list of other players he represents or once did is interesting - Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Jaylen Brown are his 4 big contracts all over $100 mil. He also represents Dinwiddie who just signed that $32 mil Bitcoin contract. All his other clients look to be vet min guys but hard to believe he never got Jeff Green paid more."
"Jeff Green must have the worst agent in all of pro ball. I know he is on the older side,  but his size and skillset is tailor made for the modern NBA game. Yet year after year he bounces around the league as a journeyman making vet min money while other less productive wings get multiyear contracts.  It is mystifying."
Way worse. The heat had almost DPOTY Lebron. Nets best defender (considering who’s on the floor in the clutch) might be Harden or Jeff green.
Zubac was one of the better rim protectors in the league last year. Nets have a washed up DeAndre Jordan and Jeff Green as center
"People can't seem to grasp that the Nets are basically a new team after the trade, its like their season just started   and they are currently lacking options, they have been playing Jeff Green like it's 2007. Give them time to fix these issues. The Cavs are not bottom feeders anymore, most players have improved every season and they never quit. Nets are the team to beat in the East."
They’re lucky Jeff Green is playing as well as he is. One injury and that roster gets dire.
Ya I really don't understand how this is even a debate. Kyrie/Harden/AD with guys like KCP/Schroeder/Harrell/Kuzma off the bench is far superior to LeBron/KD/Joe Harris and guys like Jeff Green/ TLC/ and Landry Shamet..
"Turner too. Who’s stopping them, jeff green?"
Poor nuggs have no depth. Great starters who have to play more mins than they prob should and get cooked when they sit.  Honestly reminds me of us last year with Tony Bradley or Ed Davis at center and mudiay plus jeff green on the floor
Lebron took Jeff Green to the finals he'll do it again
"Jesus, I never thought about the fact that their thoughest rotation player might be Jeff Green."
Lol they got DeAndre's corpse and Jeff Green fam.
"It's not just that. Almost every champion at least in the last decade or so had great role players. Currently, DeAndre Jordan or Jeff Green (or maybe TLC) is their 5th most important player. I'm not sure if any of them would get major minutes on the last 4-5 championship teams."
"Eh when Harden was on the floor tonight without Kyrie he was deferring to guys like Jeff Green and TLC and letting them shoot threes. He was mostly just facilitating, not driving to the rim and being aggressive like we’re used to seeing from him. Maybe he was gassed from the 50 minutes he played Wednesday, but definitely something hampered him tonight. And yes this team was playing defense like they didn’t want to be there, bad body language."
"Look at what Philly did in one offseason. They added Curry, Green, Howard. We got Jeff fucking Teague. Look at Milwaukee, they got Jrue. Look at Brooklyn.... they got JAMES HARDEN. Like we need talent not young players"
"Taurean Prince had way less touches and wasn’t as involved as he was tonight. Last game he wasn’t as envolves and nobody was commenting about not including him on a trade. Oh, and every year some asks how is Jeff Green playing for the minimum, which feels like the same comment as “why did they include Prince in the trade?” But both are usually answered pretty easily as the season progress."
Haha Jeff Green and Kyrie don't know where they are supposed to be. They really need to fix a lot of things.
Jeff Green has been tricking teams into playing him since day 1
"Harden needs to look more for his own shot. He is trying to get Jeff Green, Shamet, Jordan etc going but they cant do shit even with the ball on a silver platter"
"Jeff Green is in for Harden to defend Lance, but I'd bench Harris instead. You lose playmaking a lot sitting Harden."
Jeff Green has been the best most dependable vet for this team so far
"The issue is the paint protection for the Nets. KD at C with Jeff Green as his PF would get absolutely cooked by the Lakers rim pressure. Guys like Shroeder, Trez, AD and Bron all attack the rim a ton in the playoffs (when Bron/AD aren’t coasting). KD will either foul out or give up a ton of paint points. No one else is even a decent weak side help defender in that closing lineup."
"Actually think it's more likely Harden guards AD he did at times in the playoffs last year. Kevin Durant and AD couldnt guard each other before the KD achilles I wouldnt want to try it now. Jeff Green on AD last year in the playoffs was no good if Green is out there rather have him on LeBron.   Think Lakers would put Schroder on Kyrie, KCP on Harden, LeBron on Durant with some Anthony Davis also."
"Harden isn't actually an horrible match up guarding Lebron, he was in 2012, but now he's became so so so strong of course Lebron can just call a screen and he'll never get over it but KD sucks too at getting trought screens.  I guess we'll see a ton of Jeff Green on AD (bad thing) and Lebron (maybe not that bad).  On the other end KCP has always been good on the Kyrie type guards, and both him and Caruso are mostly good on Harden. That leaves KD, and it will be AD and Lebron, I guess more AD to free up Lebron a bit.  But overall expect a lot of small small pick and roll to target the Joe Harris, Shamet from the Lakers, and on the other end Harden will probably try to attack Schroder with small small PNR"
"Yeah they had him on Allen in OT, when they go small with Jeff Green at the 5 youll see him on bigs alot. One issue with that will be rebounding but you gotta live with trade offs.   Thing about BKN is their personnel defensively is limited enough there will be certain matchups Harden has to guard good players. Like you play Boston with Tatum/Jaylen/Kemba either Kyrie or Harden is going to have to guard one of those two when DeAndre is starting. Thing last year was Harden actually defended the 2nd most shot attempts in the NBA amongst guards in the entire NBA teams just went at him repeatedly in that Hou switching scheme. I dont think itll happen to the same degree this year but like you said the key is always attack Harden in the pick and roll and perimeter not in the post on switches. Teams still take the bait of posting him up too much."
&gt; Jeff Green  TF? Jeff Green is still in the league. TIL. Reunited with KD too.
"Plug in a player who can shoot very similarly to Steph and has for almost as long as him with a much worse supporting cast? Prime Steph has always played with at least 2 All NBA players (and often an all star caliber player off the bench) until now, where has 1 All NBA player and several other good role players (revitalized Wiggins).  Give Dame a bunch of low post split opportunities by rotating around Klay or coming off moving Draymond &amp; Bogut screens and he's putting up stats nearly as good as Steph. Not 2016 regular season Steph, but damn near close considering his stats are comparable and he's been rotting away on the Blazers for years  I'll take it one step further; Dame wins just as many rings as Curry does in his exact situation  Put Dame on the 2015 Warriors (vs 4 straight injured point guards, no Kyrie or Love in the Finals, 2017 Warriors (Kevin Durant on his team vs a historically bad Cavs D) and 2018 Warriors (with KD vs LeBron and Jeff Green as his 2nd best player) and he's very likely winning 3 rings too. I know I'll get downvoted, but it's true."
jeff green vs juan T at center you mean XD
Jeff green will guard draymond prolly
Jeff Green is like 50
If teams just paid for potential then Jeff Green would have four max contracts by now
They don't need to do that. Jeff Green as a small ball 5 and Harden at the 4 is better than having Bruce Brown at the 2 and Harris at the 3.
"Meanwhile he's the dude that was in a front office that traded a first round pick for Jeff fuckin' Green so yeah, he may want to start sitting out on a couple of his takes."
"He was only here half the year and literally turned the bench around immediately.   Getting Favors back and keeping Clarkson turns the bench into an entirely different beast. At this time last year we were relying on guys like Jeff Green, Emanuel Mudiay, Ed Davis, and even hoping Tony Bradley could develop and help out.  I'll be eternally grateful for Jordan Clarkson getting the rest of our fanbase off of Exum Island and onto Clarkson Cay."
wasn't aware jeff green+joe harris are averaging 25-30 together
"Harris and Jeff Green are good for another 25-30, then it’s just a matter of who they get to shore up the defense"
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"&gt; just saying that Harden isn't exactly a Ricky Rubio type player with hit ahead passes and pushing the pace.  He doesn't push the pace often but he absolutely does throw passes ahead in transition.  We see it a lot with him and Jeff Green, as an example."
That cracked me up lol. I recall them playing the Raptors and he saw Siakam slowing down the ball then Kyrie pushed off Jeff Green to guard Siakam by himself. Siakam proceeds to have an easy layup off the post. Weirdest shit I’ve seen in a while
"I am just trynna expose this stereotype and narrative man, i sound like a hardcore hater but shit just gets annoying. I want an accurate prospect comparison, like a young Paul Milsap or prime Jeff Green for Williams."
&gt;What do you guys think about James Harden Jeff Green and Joe Harris and their attitudes towards the situation  It's hard to sympathize for any of the Nets big 3 when all of them have been caught not wearing masks in public
Thon Makur MVP!!!!!!!!!   Jeff Green too
"I like him as a slightly bigger Jeff green for them. Not the same offensive player, but they don’t really need that from him. He’s an ok defender at the 4 and 5, not a bad pickup for them"
"I mean, he's traded for KG, Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving, and IT, among other deals he's made (Crowder, Jeff Green when people still thought he was good, then shipping Jeff Green for a pick), and without a doubt his best moves (other than maybe KG) were holding on to the Nets picks and taking Tatum and Brown. This has nothing to do with Ainge leaking information, other people are saying Ainge is trying to make a move. How can you fault Ainge if it doesn't happen here? It's not like he's putting this out"
Sixers fans will do anything to try to convince themselves that ~~Lonz..~~ Ben is a star😂😂😂. All that this shows is that the sixers starters&gt;&gt;sixers bench. You could probably find a stat like this for somebody like Jeff Green or something too.
"My god, Jeff Green is going to get murdered playing the 5 against Embiid lol. Poor man is only getting paid a vet min as well 😭😭😭"
"I've been trying to explain this to people. Are you really telling me that Kyrie, Harden, Jeff Green, Durant, and DJ cant muster up average defense with more effort?"
"They definitely don't need more floor spacing with their big 3 and Jeff Green. It's ironic that the Horace Grant/AC Green archetype of player doesn't really exist anymore, cause this Nets team could use that type of guy more than any other contender in recent history"
"But why? The Nets get did nothing to nobody. Durant didn't leave to make a championship team with Irving, he left because Golden State  trainers and medical staff didn't properly find an injury that should've sidelined him for half a year at most and that neglect caused KD to aggravate it into an almost 2-year recovery and the Nets, despite their history of bad coaching staff, bad scouting staff and just bad staff, have always had the best medical staff in the league, bar none.  I get the Kyrie hate though. He's what happens when an intelligent person refuses up get educated. Like he knows just enough to have facts that he thinks back up his terrible points, when in reality, those same exact facts are what disproves it if he bothered to read just a little bit more about it. I'm clearly taking about the flat earth thing, but I think it can be applied to him more generically.  As for Harden, I didn't really like him much before he became a Net, but I also only watched him play when it was against my team or in playoffs. I didn't like his beard and thought he was sort of a shot chucker. He's proven me wrong, I absolutely love him now. I love pass-first point guards that make everyone around them look like superstars à la Jason Kidd in the New Jersey Nets golden age. And Harden is actually out there looking like Jason Kidd with a nuclear jumpshot. He's my favorite of the big 3 now and I used to hate him... KD is still the best player on the team obviously, but I love me some ball distributers.  And the rest of the Nets, Jeff Green, Joey fist pumps, Dinwiddie, TLC, Bruce Brown, they're all likeable guys, every one of them.  I'm conclusion, I sort of get the Kyrie hate."
yea i watched it multiple times. could he be mocking jeff green? sure. but none of us know what he was saying so all this speculation is silly to me.
"I hope there's some context missing there or something, because if he really was mocking Jeff Green, that's pretty shitty."
"You’re right, what Jonas did was bad too. Doesn’t make Pat Bevs play on Jamal Murray any better. I agree his screen on Jeff Green wasn’t dirty but kicking out your leg on a defenseless player in the air, already at the rim with no chance of stopping him is 100% not a clean play. I’ve been undercut going to the rim unintentionally and seen people get undercut unintentionally and it does not look like that so idk what you’re talking about"
"I think Jeff Green was hurt, and I think Pat Bev is a little punk ass bitch, and yes, I'd say that to his punk ass bitch face"
"KD is the GM of this team. That's why DeAndre is on the team, same with Jeff Green, Andre Roberson."
"None of this is that bad. Jonas V literally yanked Chimezie Metu down after he dunked on him (breaking his wrist in the process). But nah, making a hard (but  clean) foul when the game is over and the other team is trying to disrespect you in the final seconds is bad. Sayings it’s an undercut is such a stretch. Gtfo lol. This shit happens all of the time, it’s just you casuals that love to latch on to these narratives. Oh and he accidentally hits Parker in the face when trying to poke the ball away. Lol gimme a break.  Edit: and even his screen foul in this last game was overblown. How many times does a guy that is 100 pounds heavier than him do this? Again, gimme a break. He’s probably talking shit because Bev (at175 pounds) somehow injured Jeff Green at 230 or whatever. You guys are ridiculous."
"It's supposed to be blindside.  It's a backpick.  That's sort of what they are.  Not dirty at all, and Jeff Green obviously would have seen it coming if he caught Kyrie calling it earlier."
Clips had plenty of soft calls go their way too just didn't happen to be on the last possession.  Plus we can Call it even for Jeff Green  (Fuck pat bev)
what has Pat Bev done here exactly? it was a normal play that unfortunately ended up as an injury.  then people started to claim Pat Bev was mocking Jeff Green over a 3 second clip that you can’t even hear.
Avery Bradley on Kyrie Lu Dort on harden Shane battier on kd Bruce Bowen on Harris Giannis on Jeff green
Lol if you think Jeff green is better than bobby portis. Thanks for the morning joke
jeff green is soft af
"""Jeff Green tricked y'all man""  \- Pat Bev probably  (fuck Pat Bev)"
love me some Jeff Green; what an underrated player!
"My mans had heart surgery and got back on the court ... Jeff Green is as fucking tough as they come. Getting tired of Beverley’s antics, I used to really like him."
"This is a play on to me, but since Beverly injured and mocked Jeff Green, I’ll take the karma dub."
If You look at the 4 second mark you can see that Jeff Green gets in better position to make it a difficult catch for PG. If JG doesn't hustle there PG gets an easy rebound. The whole play is made by that single extra effort/ fundamental positioning.
"The rest of the players don't do anything though, and truth be told it's not my job to worry about or feel sorry for millionaire athletes. That's on them.   If some dude is being reckless and dangerous, they, as the player's union, should get him kicked out of the league. They don't want to do that, so they can suffer with that if it's a real problem.  Obviously I'm not happy Jeff Green got injured. I don't want to see someone get injured, but if it's really that big of a deal, someone would headhunt PBev. In hockey they have enforcers precisely so this type of thing doesn't happen. The crappier teams often try to act up when they're losing badly. That's when you put in your enforcers and put them in their place. Otherwise, you get crisp, high level play from elite, skilled teams going against each other."
You see when Pat Beverly injured Jeff Green with one of his classic cheap shots? Can't hate someone more than that
"Never thought I'd see ""love"" and ""Jeff Green"" in the same sentence."
Markannen is out with a shoulder sprain for 4 weeks. It was declared as a shoulder contusion on initial diagnosis but later was termed sprain. Hopefully Jeff green isnt out for too long
If Jeff Green doesn't get hurt no one is talking about this play.  Pat Bev leaned into it...yes.  It is absolutely a foul.  But those are the same hard screens we see every night that don't even get called.
All I see from this video is that Jeff Green is soft as hell.
"Bruce brown, Jeff green, Joe Harris are good players then the rest of our bench is shooters"
Jeff “Buffalo Bill” Green
"Harden beat you guys with floaters and 3's though, did the last play make you black out the other 47:30 of the game... Also Harden has usually gotten double teamed in the playoffs, cant see that happening much if he's flanked by Kyrie, KD, Joe Harris, Jeff Green."
The irony here is that they used the challenge that would have helped them at the end on Pat Bev's obvious foul that injured Jeff Green.   Call it karma.
I'll take that over a bitch ass player who shoulder checks someone from behind. It's karma they loss their only challenge on an obvious foul (from a player with injury causing history) for when they really needed it.    More than not liking how the game ended I'm more concerned with the health of Jeff Green.
So many storylines   Lebron KD  Lebron Kyrie  Lebron and Cavs legends Jeff Green Joe Harris  Basically Lebron with everyone and then AD and Harden are there too I guess
Ouch that sucks! I hope Jeff Green is OK and recovers quickly!
"“Just an illegal screen”  Tell that to Jeff Green writhing on the floor in pain and having to be taken out of a close game.  And then Pat Bev had the nerve to mock him.  Never had a problem with him before this, but come on."
"Screening is when a defender is coming to you, Jeff Green is hasn't even move his 1st step yet when Bev throws his shoulder at him and you think it's not foul? lmao seriosly?"
Damn yall really hate Harden for balling the fuck out! Its funny af seeing disgusted LA fans. Bev had 7pts and assaulted Jeff Green. Very good guy!
"It’s definitely not malicious and you’re proving my point. If your argument is you think Bev tried to hurt Jeff Green at least own that.  The truth is these screens are set many times a game. Guys lean in, plant themselves, stick out their hips, etc constantly. It’s rarely called. This one was only controversial because a player got hurt and it’s Bev. Period."
Lol. That’s basic stance for setting a pick and taking a charge. Protect your chest and balls.  Jeff green does it too.  Doesn’t look like pat bev shoved his forearm though
Jeff Green got injured from a move by PBev but it wasn't dirty. Illegal screen at worst but it's a normal basketball play that had an unfortunate result  I hate the guy as much as anyone else but let's not result to slander.
Karma for Beverley giving Jeff Green a cheap kidney shot
Using a challenge on a Pat Bev dirty play is like one of the worst plays you can make in basketball lmao.  As a Nets fan who loves Jeff Green I’m glad it came back to bite them
"Game should've gone to OT. Great game that ended with some bullshit reffing.  Either way, Nets/Clippers is always a good time. Hope Jeff Green isn't hurt too bad"
"Jeff Green and Durant both played for the Sonics.  Westbrook and Ibaka were both [drafted by the Sonics](https://i.imgur.com/D9SJWtJ.jpg), before they were moved, so were a “Sonic” at one point too."
"Pat Bev is dirty, but tries to veil it under “hustle.” To be fair, sometimes the line between hustle and dirty is fine, but we have enough evidence that he has crossed over into the dirty side. It’s unfortunate that Jeff Green has to deal with the repercussions of a dirty play. Hope his shoulder is okay."
"The Clippers wasted their challenge on the Beverley foul, so costly, especially because it such an obvious foul.  Bruce Brown is very good, he's got so much hustle. If the supporting players continue to step up when KD (And Dinwiddie) return this team will be nigh impossible to beat.  Fingers crossed for Jeff Green too."
"Honestly, thank PBev and Ty Lue for challenging that injury-inducing screen that Pbev set on Jeff Green."
Honestly i would be pissed if I was on the opposite side of that Harden foul but Pat Bev injured Jeff Green. GG Clips and fuck Pat Bev
Y’all can thank Patrick Beverly for injuring Jeff Green to take the clippers challenge away.
"You can dislike the call, it probably should have been a no call, but the Clippers wasted their challenge on that dirty screen by Pat Bev that hurt Jeff Green."
Wasted the challenge on the Beverly foul on Jeff Green lmao
Hopefully Jeff Green is ok.   Huge to get a win against a fully healthy Clippers team while we are missing a bunch of guys
"Just realized this Nets teams are the MDA Rockets on steroids and crack.  Fitting because MDA is on this Nets team and they have an amazing small ball lineup.  Harden- is playing CP3’s role but still scoring at a insane level  Kyrie- is playing Hardens role  KD is just overkill.  Jeff Green was also playing small ball 5 for us a lot too  last year  We say defense wins championships but this Nets team can get stops when they are focused. Just like MDA Rockets (were even 7th in defense)  Just two of the three stars would be huge contenders, all 3 together are just unstoppable. Helps that they have an elite shooter in Harris and a scrappy player like Brown. Imagine if Dinwiddie didn’t go down, just crazy"
Sooo what the hell happened to Jeff Green? Dislocated shoulder?
Would be nice to have Jeff Green in the game now....
I’m still worried about Jeff green ngl
Absolutely... I hope Jeff Green isn't out for a long time... But something has to be done about Pat.
Dude Jeff Green was pissed. Kicked a bunch of shit walking to the locker room
Omg Jeff Green is such a diva. You got folded by a 5'9 guy and now you want to act tough? Wow lmao
Fuck not my man jeff green...
wait Jeff Green is on his 10th nba team????
Green looks like he’s in a world of pain...get better Jeff
Jeff Green is so weak. How are you gonna let a 5'9 guy told you like that
Man this sucks I love Jeff Green and we can't lose anymore depth.
Jeff Green not moving his shoulder at all is scary
"Just realized this Nets teams are the MDA Rockets on steroids and crack.  Fitting because MDA is on this Nets team and they have an amazing small ball lineup.  Harden- is playing CP3’s role but still scoring at a insane level  Kyrie- is playing Hardens role  KD is just overkill.   Jeff Green was also playing small ball 5 for us a lot too.  We say defense wins championships but this Nets team can get stops when they are focused. Just like MDA Rockets (were even 7th in defense)  But no team in the league can stop Kyrie-KD-Harden. Just two of the three stars would be huge contenders, all 3 are just unstoppable"
"i think it finally hit me - this team is basically the houston rockets except better in literally *every single way*.  Especially where the old team was flawed especially in this small ball lineup.  Better shooters, spacers, ball handlers, one-on-one defending,  bigs (still shit but better),  role players, like damn.  No wonder Mike said hell yeah ill come over and be assistant coach.  Harden plays the PJ role but is multitudes better on offense.   KD shouldn´t even be compared to anyone on the Rockets but you could say he plays the Jeff Green role in this offense (and they also have actual Jeff Green).   Kyrie is a better fit than either Chris Paul / Russell Westbrook.   DJ is a better Capela and then you top that off with a 3 point shooter on a level that Houston never had in Joe Harris? JEsus christ"
Lukewarm take Bruce brown is better than Jeff green and I would close games with him over jeff
Bro it’s kyrie James Harris and Jeff green vs the clippers and the rest of the nets players
"Harden, Jeff Green , Harris, and Kyrie are all shooting career highs from three. Green is 10% above his career average. Harden 4%. Kyrie 3%. Harris 7%.  I have to imagine they’ll regress some when fans are back and playoffs hit."
That's Clippers legend Jeff Green
Jeff Green is shooting 43% from three. His career is 33%. He’s gotta regress to the mean soon right?
"Assuming you mark out Giannis on KD, Dort on Harden and Simmons on Kyrie,   how is Bam keeping up with Joe Harris running around the floor?   and Gobert is getting dragged out of the paint by Jeff Green when Brooklyn goes small and we know how Harden can pick him apart when he's out of the paint."
"Does ESPN's trade machine take any of this into account? It let me set up a trade between NO and Brooklyn where I traded Adams for Dinwiddie, Jordan, and Shamet.  Edit: yeah ESPN takes restrictions into account.  For example Joe Harris or Jeff Green can't be traded until March 1. Since Adams doesn't have anything I'd say he's free to be traded anytime."
"Think he’s one of those players like Jeff Green that resurfaces when some team plays tries him at center because he can’t play perimeter defense? He’s 6’8”, bulky with a 7’ wingspan."
don’t forget Point God Jeff Green
"I’m taking a core of KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe harris, and Jeff Green any day over Mitchell, Gobert, Clarkson, Conley, and Bog. Playoffs come in and their a different beast, as you’ve seen with harden against you guys"
Jeff Green saved them tbh
"A lot of people were pretty critical of that trade. Perkins was seen as a key role player was traded during a last chance title run in exchange for players that would help them more the next few years. Maybe it was defensible from the potential of Jeff Green at the time, but they knew they were on the last fumes of the Big 3 era."
Either Jeff Green or Chandler Parsons.
"Although I was really excited about it, trading for Jeff Green was not that great...  Trading Pau for Marc didnt look great at the time, but it worked out great."
"&gt;Can we give this man Jeff Green a long term contract?  Ah, I see you are unacquainted with the enigma that is Jeff Green"
Jeff green is a journeyman nobody Is giving him a long term deal at age 35
"Wow, Rockets legends Jeff Green and Harden on the Nets, and Rockets legends Cousins and Harrell on the Lakers."
Jeff Green truly is a player
With a banner written Gracias Jeff Green.
"&gt; The Warriors can overload to stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making them pay for it.  Yea and if you replace the Warriors with the Lakers in 2020 the statement still holds true. You could even count Russ as one of those ""frontcourt players"" because the Lakers defended him like one.  The Rocket's equivalent of the Draymond play the article describes would have been something like Tucker or Jeff Green rolling to the middle of the floor to receive a pass from Harden when he was doubled. Just by doubling Harden the Lakers forced them into that action SO many times. But Tucker and Green were limited by their ball skills in that situation and did not want to dribble or hold the ball for long. The Lakers helped very aggressively off of shooters and then other defenders would rotate to wherever the help came from to basically nullify whatever advantage the roller initially had. They would also help off of Russ very liberally so often AD, who usually was on Russ, would be pestering the roller as well, making their job even harder. Tucker and Green just aren't quick decision makers and neither were any shooters that they may have gotten the ball to. The Lakers played in the gaps so well that they were always able to recover to wherever the ball went next and no one was quick enough to exploit an advantage.   The Rockets kept going to that action though because they just didn't really have any other options. The only other thing they did try, and it was actually decently effective, was just letting Harden or even Russ work in the post. I saw a lot of people talk about how they should have gone to that more and I think I mostly agree, but I don't think it was terribly efficient offense and the Lakers could consistently run lineups with multiple solid post defenders."
Yeah Jeff Green and Jeff Teague this coming Sunday
After the fourth I was convinced Jeff Green was just KD in a skin suit
And Jeff green and Joe Harris and Tyler Johnson. They were all so damn good
that behind the back bounce pass to Jeff Green works 85% of the time
"Their perimeter defense isn’t that bad tbh. KD, Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are all solid defenders on the perimeter. It’s their interior defense that is a huge problem."
"Yeah people talk about KD and Kyrie, but most of Harden's assists are to Joe Harris and Jeff Green."
Tbf Joe Harris and Jeff green are doing their parts. Green has been the perfect pnr partner hitting 40% 3s and being able to finish at the rim with huge dunks. Harris has been absolute gunner
"when KD and Kyrie sat earlier this week, it was basically the Houston Hardens with better shooting. Jeff Green at center with 3 quality shooters (Harris, Shamet, Johnson) surrounding them.  I only worry about what will happen in the playoffs, when offenses slow down and defenses pick up. But that's what KD and Kyrie are for."
jeff green is one of the most underrated players in the league
"What a nonsense post, lol. Hey everyone look the players this guys thinks are ""thriving recently"":  George Hill  Rodney Hood  Jeff fucking Green  c'mon now. If anything the opposite of your post title is the truth, FOH."
"Jeff green is shooting 43% from three this year and has got some big shots for us this season. If the plan is to let him fire, please believe that’s one of the worst mistakes you can make"
Jeff Green taking shots on that Nets team is a good thing. He would be largely ignored.
"Jeff Green is an enigma. His performance is independent of who is guarding him, even if it's the DPOY."
"To all the ppl who think they won’t make it to finals cuz of defense. Ur team has to pray that 2/3 of their big 3 has multiple off nights, then u have to double them which leaves joe Harris open. DJ brown TLC Jeff green are role players who do their job. They prob aren’t done making moves and they have 3-4 solid defenders who can get timely stops in the playoffs. Feel like a lot of ppl are underestimating the impact of having 3 generational scorers on one team, and at the same time 1 of them is one of the best playmakers in the league. They gonna win the East and give the lakers an even finals(or whoever comes from west)"
"If you lose in the finals because Jeff Green started killing you, you probably were going to lose anyway.  Better to be beat by Jeff Green than be beat by anyone else."
Jeff Green shooting 50 / 42 is by far the most impressive of all of these.
"he probably wont, mostly because jeff green will. Our lineup with jeff, harden, durant, kyrie, harris has blown teams apart. If we need additional defense i wouldnt be surprised if he does tho. Nash has alreayd had him closing games. There is a chance LA eats into his play but LA definitely will not close."
Jeff Green
"We gotta give credit to OKCs player development staff too.  They are developing young talent really well: Brodie, KD, harden, ibaka, Adams, Jeff green.   And this guy Moses brown. I remember him not being alright in college. Now he’s getting 20 20"
"Putting on my salty sonics hat here, Presti also gutted the Sonics almost immediately after becoming GM, trading Rashad Lewis and Ray Allen for garbage (not you Jeff Green, you're cool) and put the most pathetic product he could on the court for what would be the last season in Sonic history."
"23 games without KD and 7 without Kyrie, I just told you.  Kyrie is great, but have you ever stopped to consider why Jeff Green, Brown, Jordan, Claxton are shining?  It’s literally because of Harden. Jeff Green gets 80% of his points from Harden PnRs, and has literally doubled his averages since Harden’s arrival.  All Jordan and Claxton do is catch Harden lobs for all their points.  Brown gets the majority of points from Harden PnRs and pocket passes.  All these guys are doing better because of Harden. The guy came to a 7-7 team who completely killed its depth to make room for him, then lost KD for 2 months (and going), and had to play a bunch of games without either KD or Kyrie.  Despite all of this, they’ve gone 25-7 with him since then, and Harden has been putting up insane numbers. He was player of the month for February and is averaging a casual 29/10/12 in March."
&gt; but he's at best 5% the player claxton is.  This is probably one of the worst takes I've seen on this subreddit in recent memory.  You really think Claxton is 20x the player Jeff Green is?
Jeff Green is good enough to close games for Brooklyn.
If he can just be what Jeff Green has been this season - but a much better ball handler and passer - then that's a very good piece.
"Jeff Green is averaging 12.8 Points over his career and not 9.6 as you claim. He also got diagnosed with a serious heart condition after having 3 very good years to start his career. It's absurd to criticize Presti for picking him. Given the circumstances, Green had a great career."
We all fell for Jeff green at some point lol
"I’ve listed a few here. Thought the George Hill for Kawhi Leonard trade was a mistake at the time, didn’t think Kawhi would be as good as Hill lol  Thought we should’ve grabbed Fultz on draft night.  I thought Lance Stephenson was going to take off after Indy but thought Charlotte was a bad place and thought his next stop is where he’d really break through.  Fell for Jeff Green a few times."
Ok so do you want to talk about the other 8 players you listed? If all you have is Presti drafting Jeff Green as being an average player at #5 then your argument is pretty weak.   All those other names mentioned were low draft picks and you're literally going to casino with those.
you're right and those were all very low picks compared to being top 10 in a draft. After the first 10-11 picks you're really just rolling the dice usually.   Also since when is Jeff Green a bad draftee?
"Presti also picked Jeff Green, Cole Aldrich, Perry Jones, Mitch McGarry, Cameron Payne, Josh Huestis, Alex Abrines, Terrance Ferguson and Dakari Johnson.  So, there's that."
"Kd, Lamarcus aldridge, blake griffin, nicholas claxton, bruce brown, Jeff green. I think our front office is smart enough to know we can beat the best bigs 1:1 on defense. But with enough front court depth, we can replenish stamina in shorter minutes and keep em on their toes."
"He had 25 possessions at the time, there was a lot of room for error.  Turns out it was the case.  He's probably near the 50th percentile (just eyeballing, so there's room for error) for anyone taking over 1FGA in isolation per game at 0.96 PPP.  I could understand if it was a Harden or Kyrie isolation but it was Jeff Green, he's probably the last one on the floor I would want Edwards to isolate against."
"Also, yeah man, Durant leaving in free agency and Westbrook demanding a trade. And Jeff Green is definitely a major needle mover."
Jeff green is and was garbage
"Not a big fan of an Anthony Edwards isolation on Jeff Green as the play they drew up after a timeout.  Green isn't some lockdown defender, but that's not some big mismatch either."
Still will be....adding griffin and Aldridge at this point will hurt more than help... They were doing just fine with Jeff Green  ..he knew his role and performed admirably
"Heck yeah, and bring Jeff green, thabo, and serge with them"
I guess it's too early to tell but still don't think he's any better than Jeff Green in the role that only one of them can have when everyone is playing.
"Of all the veteran Sean's Marks has bringing in aside from our Superstars, Jeff green has to be the most underrated signing"
"If a GM gets Durant, Harden, Westbrook, Ibaka, and Jeff Green it seems like they did a good job.  Also, just because a GM works for an ownership group that doesn't make him fully capable of retaining all those players, it doesn't mean the GM squandered the talent."
"I couldn't support a guy that squandered having Durant, Harden, Westbrook, IBaka, and Jeff Green. Doesn't seem like someone who's very good at their job."
"Prest gets praised for turning Durant, Harden, Westbrook, Ibaka, &amp; Jeff Green into trade exceptions.   Funny stuff"
"Igoudala has 12 mill(11% of cap, Dany Green has 15 mill 14% of cap) Blake has veteran thats like 2m, and Drummond 800k for the rest of season, so if you had LMA, Griffin and Drummond at same time it would take 6% of your cap space. And considering that base max is 25% 30% or 35% of cap if you had 2 stars on young team it is 55% 60% of cap, and on expirienced team it is 70%. On nets big 3 takes up 100% of cap space. So it is not the same like Rondo, Jeff Green, Ingles or Iggy signing."
"Green's been in closing line-ups for almost the entire season; barring injuries, BG and LMA will not.  Jeff Green does way more for the Nets than you're giving him credit for."
"""Super star talent"" is a buzzword. The things that made Griffin so good in next level athleticism and shot creation are gone. If anything, his skillset isn't optimized for being a role player like other players are. Jeff Green is shooting 40% from 3 and a very versatile defender, that's why he's so impactful as a role player despite not having ""superstar talent""."
"The 2011 Celtics have to be mentionned  KG, Shaq, Pierce, Ray, Jermaine O'Neal, Rondo, Jeff Green, Bradley, Krstic (who was good in his prime), Troy Murphy (yeah that sound dumb now but he was a 15/12 guy in Indy)."
Jeff Green was big for us.
"Thats a big stretch. Super star talent has super star talent and Jeff Green isn't a super star. Now, they are both older and not able to go 100% all the time, which is why they couldn't carry teams, but Blake Griffin is going to be able to give the nets a lot more when he is the 4th option or off the bench and playing against second unit guys for reduced minutes."
"He'd get those offers, but those teams would end up regretting it and he'd get bought out again if his deal is longer than a year.   Jeff Green is better than him."
"So he's basically in the same role and contract as Jeff Green/Bruce Brown, but just a lot more outrage"
"Seriously, he's had good games on the Pistons this season but once he dunks once with the Nets he's the devil. Him and LMA are going to be about as important as Jeff Green, i.e. good rotation players who will provide minutes and flexibility but not giant game changers like fans are pretending they are."
Not really for dudes like Blake. He just has name recognition.   Why do role players like Jeff Green get the minimum every year. Hes a quality role player.   They dont have any leverage. Vets will have to take the minimum if they want to stay in the league
the nets in a way can have better spacing because we play 4-5 shooters at all times. warriors essentially had 3 at all times. Nets can run 4 with harden joe kyrie and durant and also jeff green whos been shooting 40+ this year.
They might not even get serious minutes. Jeff green and kd are gonna get most of our forward minutes
"I disagree, I think it's about relative value. Yes, those guys are past their primes. But they're still above average bench guys. Most teams run an 8 man rotation in the playoffs. That woulda left the Nets with Jeff Green as their best backup PF/C. He's been playing well this year but I'd still take a washed LMA as my backup C over a washed Jeff Green. Same with Blake Griffin and whoever the nets were planning on running as their backup at that position.   Those two guys are better than most teams' backup PF/C, so they have positive value."
"&gt; I mean it’s very likely neither will touch the floor much in the playoffs if everyone’s healthy.   Considering Nets' depth, I'm 100% sure they will see the floor. But I can't say what impact they will have though. It's more likely Jeff Green plays 30 min to Blake/LMA 10."
"How is Jeff Green gonna guard bigs like Embiid, AD or even Giannis lol"
"Clearly you don't watch games either, Joe is no slouch on defense, and if you want to call 48.7% from 3 icy hot then I guess you do you. The biggest sign you don't watch basketball is you forgot about Claxton, his defensive impact is crazy good. Jeff Green and Bruce Brown have been a thorn in the side of anyone we play against.   We hated Prince, we were glad to see him go."
"Im confused, did you just tell someone they don't watch basketball and then said you had some of the best role players in the league?  Um you kinda traded them away, in case you aren't aware. Allen, Prince, LeVert, Kurucs.  You only have like.. Jeff Green, Dinwiddie and Joe Harris who is like an icyhot with no defence..  lmao.."
Everyone needs a Jeff Green on their team.
"Ironically, Nuggets are one of the teams Jeff Green didn't play for."
Jeff green the hawks killer
"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it's a totally valid opinion.  I would have thought the same a month ago but right now the Nets just look so offensively dominant.  Joe Harris could legitimately be a third option for any contender that has decent ball-handlers.  Deandre Jordan isn't great, but he also isn't trying too much. I would expect a marginal uptick from him in the playoffs. Jeff Green, Griffin and LMA aren't amazing but they all provide depth and versatility to the 4/5 spot.  Then you've got two guys who are top 10 scorers in the league: Kyrie and Harden.  I think they could win the East without KD, and I don't see any team beating them when they're at full strength."
"I think they would have to get rid of Dlo if they got cade. Way too many dudes who shoot the ball so much isn't going to work out. Especially on a really young team like the wolves  Beasley AE Cade ? Towns  Also the wolves are gonna have to start letting some of these young guys go. Too many young guys on this team aren't going to allow for them to get out of the gutter. You need guys that know their role in order for the players you actually value long term to blossom and be those players you envision. Too many young guys on a team is just going to leave a lot of problems of fit with guys not knowing their roles as a player yet.  If the wolves got cade I would shop Dlo, okogie, and culver for a good defensive forward that can play next to KAT. Just off the top of my head OG or Brandon Clarke make sense but would require trading for them. I think Thad, Jeff Green, and DJJ can all be fa's next year depending on opt outs so maybe overpaying for those guys would also be an option although it depends if they actually do hit fa.  And just getting players that know their role and aren't going to be taking shots away from the guys you care about long term which is cade AE and kat.  Some vets along with rubio would be nice too."
"See that’s where you are wrong. Claxton is arguably much better than THT. The nets have shooters every where on the bench with Jeff Green, Landry, TLC and Tyler Johnson. I’d argue that the Nets bench is even better tbh."
"If he’s even on the court. I’m expecting the nets rotation is mostly gonna be Durant harden kyrie Harris Jeff green. Then dj will probably get a few minutes and claxton as well. There’s gonna be a few minutes available for the next guys. Shamet, brown, Aldridge, Blake, Tyler Johnson will all see DNPs some games"
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Nicolas Claxton 6. Jeff Green 7. Bruce Brown 8. DeAndre Jordan 9. Blake Griffin 10. LMA
"Lakers : signed a center that's worse than the 2 centers they already had (better fit than Harrell tho), knowing that AD will be at center in most match ups in the playoffs  Nets : signed two bigs who can't move, and can't play defense, they already had the most talented offensive team of all time, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and Claxton are all better fit than those 2  Haven't watched enough Rondo this season, but at some point being bad in the regular season may not just be because he waits for the playoffs, great for him for doing it last year, but shall we expect a 34years old injured undersize point guard to do it every year ?"
"It is just a fact teams win because they are stacked.  Aldridge, Griffin and DJ are all massive negatives in the court. Jeff Green is by far their best center and he will get cooked by someone like AD or Bam.  If this was 2019 then yes this team would be historically stacked. But as it is it has 2 top 6 players. A top 25 player and a top 75 player. Then a whole bunch of guys in the 150-250 range.  That's not close to as stacked as the warriors in say 2017 with 2 top 4 players, a top 15 player and a top 25 player. Oh and add in another all-defensive calibre wing and top 100 player.  The nets are a super team but generally there are 2-3 super teams a year. 2019 sixers was a super team. Top 15 in embiid, top 10 in butler, top 25 in Simmons, top 40 in Harris. They lost in 7 in the 2nd round.  This nets team is incredibly flawed and I don't think they will win a ring. But even if they do it isn't a detriment to KDs legacy to be the best player on a team with Harden and Kyrie."
"Jeff green is our worst center defender by a good bit, even though he is quicker he is undersized. LMA would probably be a better option against traditional centers"
"Have to think this team has the most players that have scored a 40 point game... You can add JR Smith, Clarkson, Jeff Green if you drop the qualifier down to 40"
"And while Jeff Green wouldn't have seemed as flashy, as a 7th name? That's a pretty quality piece."
"Jeff Green is a comparable shooter, if they wanted to go 5 out they had him already and he can actually move his feet unlike Aldridge.  And they 've been already unstoppable even with a non shooter (their centers or Brown)"
"Don't you guys get tired of all this whining and all these arbitrary rules about ""super teams""? Like seriously, this is worthwhile subject matter? Half of it doesn't even make sense - Jeff Green is likely better than half of Brooklyn's ""all stars"", same for guys on other top teams like Schroeder and Harrell... Where is this set of rules that defines what's a morally acceptable way for a team to construct its squad?"
"Wizards fan because I grew up outside DC. Jeff Green and KD fan because I was born in the same city / grew up in the same county. John Wall fan because he made me love wizards basketball even when it was total pain and suffering. Will probwbly follow Beal for the same reasons if he ever leaves DC.  So I follow the nets, wizards, and rockets."
"I don't like the signing, it doesn't address our defensive needs, takes away minutes from Jeff Green and Nic Claxton at center, and offensively takes shots away from our KD, Harden, Ky, Joe, etc. Best case scenario is all of his minutes come from DJ, but even DJ can be serviceable at times on defense (against other non-shooting bigs). I barely liked the Blake signing, but LMA makes even less sense because at least Blake is versatile enough to play the 4 and can kinda move defensively. If he chose Brooklyn, it's with the expectation of playing, and I don't really see a role for him."
" I mean if you add antawn Jamison to kyrie, KD, harden, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Deandre Jordan then yeah it’s a super team"
You sound like you don’t watch the games. Blake isn’t playing over Claxton. He’s barely playing over Jeff Green  Edit: actually I didn’t realize Jeff Green has been playing a ton lately. In Blake’s last two games he has 19 and 20 minutes. Clax is at 22 and 26 while Green is at 35 and 30
"4th option is Joe Harris, a top 5 shooter in the league.   5th is LMA (maybe?), a borderline hall of famer who, while a shell of his former self, still puts up 10pts/5rebs in his sleep who can get a quality shot off of anybody in the league. 6th option is Blake, another borderline hall of famer who is still a very good passer, decent finisher at the rim, and has developed a very respectable 3 pt shot.  This doesn’t include guys like Deandre Jordan, Jeff Green, or Bruce Brown, who are literally 7/8/9 off the bench. I don’t think I’m overrating the talent on the Nets whatsoever."
"Regardless, he's better than DJ. After the harden trade DJ was our only big outside of Jeff Green. 2 months later we got Blake, LaMarcus, and Claxton (back from injury) ahead of DJ.   I'll take the depth 😂"
"Joe Harris,  Nic Claxton and Jeff green"
"People act like LMA is this crazy add, he’s a starting caliber player. Jeff Green is probably better, and maybe Blake Griffin.  Now, all of the Nets players in their prime? 😳"
Joe Harris Jeff Green even Claxton might all be better than Griffin and Aldridge. Thats their core imo.
"Not even. Joe Harris, Nic Claxton, and Jeff Green are all clearly ahead of him."
"“Wow the clippers traded Chris Paul, JJ Reddick, Jamal Crawford, Luc Mbah a Moute, Paul Pierce, Jeff Green, Josh Smith, Lance Stevenson, and how many of their 1st round picks for the next 20 years for KD, Kyrie, Harden, and LMA????” - me five years ago if someone told me that"
jeff green and claxton would be the players building the wall they play important minutes
Who is going to be in the rotation over BOTH Aldridge and Blake? Jeff green? Alize Johnson? Deandre Jordan?   Claxton is the only one that might. But he’s young and probably won’t play in the playoffs.
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
"The nets have Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Nic Claxton looking like top tier role players when they play next to Harden alone. Sure the experience of a vet is nice from a leadership perspective, but it doesn’t mean all that much when the player’s body is broken down a la Blake and Aldridge. In big games down the stretch when Kyrie Harden and KD are all playing, the Blake and Aldridge duo are gonna be splitting what 18-20 minutes combined? Vets in the buyout market going to the nets is hardly the parity altering move that people in this thread are pretending it is"
"So where does this roster stand all-time?    LA and Blake are but peripheral pieces ffs.   They still got Harris, Jordan, and a resurgent Jeff green. Bruce Brown. Dinwiddie chillin on the mend. Roberson too I think?  Shamet and Tyler Johnson have been disappointments but still.   This is ridiculous."
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."
You are correct but people are acting like this locks in the championship without realizing that Jeff Green and Nic Claxton will start and close more games than LMA and Blake.
"I'm a nets fan, but it's unlikely Aldrige gets any real minutes. Claxton is better than him and Jeff Green spread the floor. Also Griffin is in a bit of a resurgence and Aldrige looked washed for the spurs."
"Lol why not, Nets were the laughingstock of the league and in pick hell, built a playoff team off developing draft picks in the 20s and taking DLo in a salary dump, and then used that foundation to acquire stars.   Plus Griffin and LMA will likely be solid role players but they're not what makes the team stacked. Jeff Green is legit more valuable than them in Brooklyn's schemes. It's getting Harden that made the team stacked despite plenty of people insisting that it wasnt gonna work"
"This team is more stacked than the 16-17 Warriors  KD - KD  Curry- Harden  Klay- Kyrie  Draymond- either Aldridge or Blake ( Draymond easily)  But Nets have better role players in Jeff Green, Shamet, Brown, Jordan and Claxton  Plus Dinwiddie but he’s been out"
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc  This is a finals lock, it would be an absolute embarrassment if they do not win the title this year."
"Ideally you would want to hold down the paint first and foremost. Next, I would play hard defense on James harden like the lakers did last year and run the three pointers off the line. I’ll live with James Harden floaters all day knowing that Lebron or Ad can easily get a bucket inside to match that. I would relentlessly attack KD, and Kyrie in isolation on offense. Kyrie/KD can’t contain bron I’m not even sure they can contain Schroeder. Kyrie/KD would be gassed trying to hold it down on both ends.   Later on In the game, Jeff Green/Blake griffin is another weak link on offense to abuse. If it got into a point into the game where harden or Kyrie are getting to the rim at will I would be more than comfortable letting Jeff fucking green being the one that beats us.   I think it ultimately comes down to limiting the three’s and staying out of foul trouble. You need to attack them at their weaknesses defensively and limit three point opportunities."
"I don’t want to hype ourselves up too much, but our starting four is unguardable. Harris is looking like he’s gonna have a GOAT shooting year which makes it impossible to double or switch because we have lob threats for bigs. Add to that, Bruce brown looks great, Jeff green is a great bench player and DJ and Clax are looking serviceable. I hope we get McGee or Drummond because Embiid scares the shit out of me, but I really don’t think anyone is gonna match out offensive output"
"Idk, seems inexcusable for a team with harden, kyrie, Blake, Jordan and the likes of Harris, spencer, shamet and Jeff green to lose in round 1-2.  Even without Kd that team should at least make it to ecf."
"Jeff Green  Olynik is a better shooter tho, but Jeff Green provides better versatility on both ends"
Except for jazz Jeff green. Love the guy and he’s a great vet. But he was awful for us
Nah. He was the guy who bricked 97% of his shots. Well along with the rest of Lebrons teammates except for Jeff green in that game but him especially.
Jeff green lol
"Are we talking currently, career-wise, or during their primes?  Just kidding, it’s Jeff Green for all three."
Jeff Green
To be cut after 10 days when Brooklyn realize Jeff Green already does everything they want Blake to do but better
"Well, Jeff Green shot 56% from the floor and 37% from three (43% in the playoffs) in Houston.   I think there's a component that is related to playing with James Harden, as Rivers, Tucker, Faried, all had career highs across the board playing with him."
"It's clutch time. Kyrie brings the ball up the court.  KD and Harden are standing at the wings.  Jeff Green and Bruce Brown in the corners.  Ben Simmons, accepting the defensive challenge: *oh fuck yeah spread it*"
Yeah no it definitely wasn't  The second best player in the playoffs was Jeff Green if you ask me
"Well KD has barely played since Harden got there. Honestly the shooting percentages for the Nets seems unsustainable. Jeff Green has played with a lot of good teams is a career 44% shooter from the field and 33% from three. This years he’s shooting 51% from the field and 43% from three.   Kyrie, a career 47% shooter from the field, is shooting 52% from the field. Joe Harris, and career 44% shooter from three, is shooting 50% from three.   These are mostly games where they’ve only had two superstars, not three. I think the Nets are the clear favorites. But I’m curious if some of this performance is related to having no fans in the stadiums. Shooting overall is on a historic pace."
"I don’t know how the season will play out given how close all these teams are to each other, but I do think there’s some context missing about our losses to you. Not only didn’t we have Kemba in both our losses, but we were also missing Smart (who we’ve been missing all year) and in our first loss, we also didn’t have Theis. As a result we had Jaylen Brown as point guard in our first game against you in a lineup with Tatum/Javonte Green/Semi Ojeleye/Tristan Thompson. This was against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela. In our second loss, we were on a back to back on the road having played four games in six days and we had Jeff Teague starting. In the one game Kemba played, he led our team in scoring, plus minus, and steals and really was the difference throughout the game."
" people will always find a way to discredit his finals wins and highlight his losses. People can just bring back the OKC argument and say that the sixers were too young to stand a chance. Win a finals against Ben Simmons will rapidly turn into a meme. If the nets get there, Dinwinnie ain’t playing so it’s a fake ring Lol ""twitter"" won’t give him credit for that unless he beats the whole squad. If AD gets to dominate against a team with Jeff green and DJ at center, then Bron got carried."
"Harden just elevates his teammates better. Jeff Green, Joe Harris, DJ, literally everyone gets a boost from his playmaking."
jeff green
Jeff Green still does that relatively frequently
"Harden, Durant, and Jeff Green?"
Draymond averaged 10 PPG on 42/31/71 shooting splits that season. Jeff Green is a better offensive player than Dray.
The nets had a ton of turnovers though. With harden back playing pg that will probably not happen  I get what you're saying but i don't think Jeff Green is better for the overall team than harden lol
"I remember when Jeff Green said he was “The Jeff of the East”, after he went off one night against the Cavs. It was fucking weird."
No it doesn't. KD probably can't shoulder the burden of creating that much offense over the course of multiple series'  They need Harden healthy and back to most of his usual self for those possessions where KD/Kyrie aren't isolating.  He's so much better at getting the others involved and having Jeff Green or Joe Harris show up for 20 in some random game is what could win them a championship
Everyone who freaked about how adding Blake Griffin broke the league failed to mention Jeff Green who is shooting nearly 40% from 3 and has been a versatile defender. Was a litmus test for who has actually been watching the nets play and who has been freaking out from just reading box scores.
"Jeff Green has always been a pretty good player. He's not ""#1 player on a championship team"" good but he's good"
"""Great"" is a stretch, but Jeff Green has been legit good this year too.  He's far exceeded my expectations of what he would be."
Orlando Magic legend Jeff Green
He’s angling for jeff green to be his backup 5 at the minimum next year
"Y’all laugh but Jeff Green was the only reason Lebron made it to the finals in 2018, only other guy that didn’t gag under pressure"
Lol Budenholzer taking a timeout when Jeff Green is on the floor injured is the most Budenholzer thing ever.
Jeff Green with that rebound while in extreme pain
"Man Jeff Green has taken lot of damage this year. Almost every game, he is on the receiving end of a collision. Love this dude."
"Jeff Green fighting through the pain and still getting the rebound, he’s tough"
Someone please clip Jeff Green putting his ass out there
Jeff Green post up with Kyrie and KD both on the court is not good offense
"Uncle Jeff going for his damn near daily ""oh wait, Jeff Green can still do that at 34?""  He's done it so many times this year but every time he throws it down like that I'm surprised."
Jeff Green went for a monster poster there
Lebrons has a million times better finals  performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green Than Jordan did vs plumbers like Jeff hornasec and Danny Ainge  You are a joke
"That’s because we didn’t have Blake yet and Claxton was still out at that time so we didn’t have any bigs other than DJ and Jeff Green (and our late 2nd round pick Reggie Perry). Also, Shamet was playing terribly back then"
"Blake, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet, Deandre Jordan, Luwawu-Cabarot, Claxton are all solid rotational pieces.   Steph/Draymond will show up but if that Nets team caught us on a day when Oubre/Wiggins aren't having good games then I can legitimately see us losing"
"Ye, a wall of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan are really gonna slow Giannis down"
Calling Jeff Green an average defender is being **majorly** generous. He's really bad on D.
Jeff Green is a four
Just want to let all blazers know that Jeff Green never ever shoots this well
I compared pre-Max Wiggins with last season Julius Randle before Randle took the step from high volume low quality offense to offensive star. The potential was there but I didn't really believed that he would get make it.  I am usually skeptical about players taking that step. Most players with the potential to take that step don't take it.  Deandre Ayton is useful for a contender as a role player center.   Other players that should have been better than they were: Jeff Green  and Monta Ellis.
"The line-ups have been a product of a sensible rotation of Kyrie/Harden/KD (they've only played four games without any of these), and three players (Harden/Griffin/LaMarcus) who've come into the starting rotation, and finding better options than DeAndre Jordan. Not all line-up changes are born equal. The core outside of the big three (I'm saying Jeff Green/Joel Harris/Bruce Brown) have missed a combined 10 games out of 189.  I am not saying Nash is a bad coach. I am saying that he has a core of self-coaching superstars during his first year coaching in any capacity, during a unusual season. I am saying that Nash hasn't yet had the opportunity to prove much at all."
"im bringing up the warriors as an example of how having one star on the court just doesnt magically make you win games. TLC has played more minutes this year than duarnt for us. Bruce brown and jeff green have played more minutes than harden. Again you're seriously overselling how much our big 3 have played and how  little salary we have tied up outside of them. We basically have ran a one star with minimum salary players or no star lineups for half the season.   and I never said marks was the best executive in the league. plenty of guys who have won EOTY and arent best executives in the league. Im just saying what marks did with no picks was a historic rebuild, there was nobody who thought that team could exit that disaster as well as it did and was actually asset rich at the end of it with a bunch of good tradeable assets and young players.   Toronto and Denver also have some of the best front offices in the league. you saying theyre better isnt a knock against marks for EOTY. also look at recent winners. i mean clippers won it last year and the year and the warriors won it in 2017. getting big free agents is cledarly a big part of the award."
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.   Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining. If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
"How about shamet, Bruce brown, claxton , Jeff green, Tyler Johnson ? Marks got all these guys for virtually nothing and they’ve all been exceptionally good for us.   EOTY is always a bit of a lifetime achievement award. How about developing levert,Allen, joe Harris, dlo, dinwiddie?  Like we haven’t had our stars together for most of the year. Look who was on the court yesterday for us. We’ve been picking up wins all year with our top guys out. When you’re as top heavy as us and you’re missing guys you usually end up sucking but we’ve still been exceptionally good."
Uh Jeff Green??? Hello??
Uhhh joe harris? Jeff green? Shamet was pretty good?
Jeff green just stays Dunking on people at 34 like it’s nothing
"I swear, the Nets' fourth star is either Joe Harris or Jeff Green depending on the weather"
Jordan literally wouldnt make the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 Cavs teams LeGOAT took to the finals  IM not talking about in the d league expansion plumber era late 80s and 90s where jordan made the playoffs going 30-52. Im talking about in the modern era  You obviously don't care about facts  None of Jordans finals performances was 1/10 as good as Lebrons vs the Spurs and Warriors. Even though Lebron was being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and Green instead of Pe teachers  like Danny ainge and Jeff horansec  Learn something before you start yapping non sense
"G&amp;G Grizzlies will forever be my favorite basketball, but yea if you upgrade Jeff Green, Tayshaun Prince, or even Rudy Gay to Kawhi Leonard, I think you’ve got the recipe for a ring.  PG - Mike Conley SG - Tony Allen SF - Kawhi Leonard PF - Zach Randolph C - Marc Gasol  Geez. Hard to imagine many teams scoring +100 against that defensive starting lineup."
Jeff Green. Super underrated player.
"Joe Harris, Jae Crowder, Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green"
* When he won 50 games with his second best player as Jeff Green. * When he carried his team to the one seed without Westbrook in his MVP year. * When he led his team to finals at age 23. * When did you start watching basketball dude?
When he won 50 games with his second best player as Jeff Green.         When he carried his team to the one seed without Westbrook in his MVP year.      When he led his team to finals at age 23.       When did you start watching basketball dude?
"The 2018* but I kinda disagree. Love, Clarkson, Jeff Green, Korver, Hood, JR, Hill, Nance is actually not a horrible team talent wise. Yeah they played like shit that year, but they all seemed to have flourished before and after. Weird anomaly"
"It goes far beyond Kyrie/Harden absorbing his scoring and touches tho. Really it’s about who’s gonna be guarding the bigger wings/ forwards of PHI and MIL. You got Jeff green, and maybe Blake. That’s it. KD is really essential for those matchups"
"let me clarify u/puffx0r and u/makaveli80  I watched every game Harden has played in Houston. I didn't have a team and started following them after.  I didn't say his teamates were bad. I said overall the team had below average OFFENSIVE players. Or the players were extremely one dimensional  A great example is PJ Tucker. With the spacing of D'Antoni and Harden's scoring gravity and creation he got some of the easist possible three pointers, wide open corner 3's. That is literally the only thing he is capable of doing, he is well below league average above the break, his jumper isn't fast. He has an incredibly rudimentary handle, can't pass and bc he is groundbound and slow he has to shoot a tough low percentage floater instead of a layup  How did PJ look offensively without Harden and D'antoni? 4.4 pts on 36.6% from the field and 31.6% from three. All numbers are a career low.  We saw the limitations of the role players against the best defense in the league with the Lakers. When they doubled Harden the team was in trouble. They were comfortable shooting contested threes, attacking the closeouts, passing, cutting or finishing. Same issues against the zone looks.  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  To be clear there have been some good offensive role players like Ryan Anderson, but they were still limited. He went defense first on his minimum salary guys  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  It's not just Joe Harris. Shamet, Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are all very good, and versatile role players on offense"
"Congrats, Jeff Green"
That's a terrible way to define plug and play imo. By that definition westbrook is more plug and play then someone like Jeff Green the past 2 years who could fit on any team
"Russ &gt; wall  Covington &lt; wood  Pj tucker = KPJ  Jeff green, rivers, McLemore &lt; Tate, olynk  The rosters always been pretty bad besides the chris Paul + Capela years and even then the supporting cast was bad"
"And they still had Horford, Brown, Tatum, Smart, and Rozier...   Meanwhile the Cavs had LeBron and uhh Jeff Green, JR Smith, George Hill, etc"

Someone get Jeff Green some help
"I may go top 5, the versatility is huge. Definitely top 5 if you include Spence. You got Blake and Claxton as bigs. Jeff Green is balling and may be the closing 5. Shamet and TJ sniping. Plus Bruce for defense and cutting. They can matchup to almost any style. Losing LA hurt for Embiid minutes but no one really stops him."
He struggled against Jeff Green
"Joe ""Just a Shooter"" Harris with 6 assists and really good defense  Nets with 7 out of 8 players scoring double digits, none of which were Kyrie Irving lol  I love Jeff Green so much, if we win a ring he will damn sure have earned his"
Adam Silver will get your account shadow banned if you try to discuss where Jeff Green got his new Heart
How is Jeff Green still so athletic months away from 35?
Jeff Green really makes that look so easy
"I’d disagree and I’m biased but context makes Rose’s mvp really impressive. Comparing MVP cases year to year is idiotic in the first place but I’m really sick and tired of people who never watched the NBA that year talk down what a player he was.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"He mentions Cedi Osman, so this isnt 2015 it's 2018. Jeff green was also only on the cavs in 2018. I mean KLove wasnt trash in 2018 but I think it's pretty fair to say that he had fallen off a bit by that point.  &amp;#x200B;  In 2018 KLove was a 2nd option on 17.6/9.3/1.7 on 46/42/88 and like 61.4TS%. Which are decent numbers but no where near 26/12. And really below the level of what i'd think you need in a 2nd option for a team which was pretty much ass outside of Lebron and KLove.  &amp;#x200B;  And just in general 2018 cavs = garbo is a pretty common take. imo it is pretty fair to say that it was one of the greatest carry jobs of all time."
Losing LeBron obviously. It's the only time the Cavs have been relevant. Wouldn't be surprised if he got this Cavs team to the Finals. Man made the Finals with a Love. Thompson. Hill. JR Smith line-up. With Jeff Green being their best bench piece.   Let that sink in. Swap him with any player and they don't make the playoffs. LeBron is so far away the best player in NBA history it's insane.
"Possibly Harden. It's gonna be a while before we see someone who can average &gt;36 ppg over a season, but also able to average &gt;11 apg over a different season.   My real answer: Jeff Green, who has gotten more athletic and become more of a poster machine as he gets older."
"Yeah it gets overshadowed because of how bad Houston shot in their game 7, but Boston had an all-time terrible shooting performance too. We were ahead with 6:30 to go in that game 7, could not score down the stretch. Got beat by 48 minutes of Bron and Jeff Green."
Jeff Green
Love has never played well against the. Warriors. The three best players would be Draymond / Wiggins/ and random Jeff Green game / then Love  Warriors in 6
He was more Jeff Green than Blake Griffin
"A lot of guys on the Nets honestly.   Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Nicolas Claxton...  I can see any one of them stepping and making a big contribution."
"Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Paschall   Over IT, JR, Love, TT, Jeff Green"
"The same thing is happening with the Nets though.   People are talking about “overpowered role players” like... Jeff Green, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and Blake Griffin."
"And when people say 'oh it's because Bron was holding him back as he was the 3rd star!', K Love didn't get much better in 2018 when he was the 2nd option with Kyrie gone.   He still sucked, and was a damn near net negative in the playoffs. Jeff Green was better."
"Steph Curry, one of the greatest players of all time, is a 10th seed with a better version of wiggins and draymond green. I don’t see how you can expect KAT to do good when he had a shitty version of wiggins and ig jeff teague as his third best player. It’s way harder then you think to carry a shit team to being good."
"Suggesting Russ was elite help in those early years is pretty wrong. KD averaged 20, 25, and 30 in his first 3 seasons with little help. Russ could barely get above 40% field goal percentage and Jeff Green was the only other mid-teens scorer on the team during those years."
Nobody can guard Kyrie KD and Harden. Teams can barely guard Jeff Green and Joe Harris. I doubt Embiid can keep up with the nets scoring
And Blake Griffin and Jeff green
Even shamet is a good shooter and Tyler Johnson and Jeff green aren’t bad shooters. All those guys are going to be wide open next to harden/kyrie/kd
Lately Jeff green has been throwing down nasty dunks !
Jeff Green aging like Lebron out there wtf lol
Jeff Green with two monster dunks today and Burke says he has ‘quiet nine points’...
Jeff Green has been super dependable this season. Always surprised no team ever kept him long term. He’s not great but he’s everything you want in a key role player.
The annual Jeff Green “wow this guy’s really athletic” dunk (2009-2021)
Jeff Green woke up with a mission today
What did the rim do to Jeff Green?
jeff green the ultimate journeyman
Isn't Jeff Green like a senior citizen.. how is he doing that.
jeff green literally tries to poster someone every time he drives the ball its hilarious.
Bruce Brown and Jeff Green always blow into their hands before shooting a free throw  Not sure who started it and whose copying who
When Jeff green posters someone
The classic Jeff green syndrome
"Jeff green for nets is up there as well, I thought he was done after the jazz cut ties with him"
Harden and literally anyone. Harden/Bruce brown was the most efficient pnr for a while. Harden/Jeff green the same.
"Harden, Jeff Green and Hakeem"
The worst team LeGOAT faced in the finals is better than the best team Jordan faced in the plumber era   Lebron has had a million times better finals performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did vs Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec  There wouldn’t even be a Jordan era if even Durant played in the d league expansion era  Old lebron &gt; prime Jordan as we saw again in last years finals.   Get over it
Kyrie didn’t even play that good it was fucking Jeff green who killed us
"That was nasty, almost as good as Jeff Green put last game."
People were freaking out about signing Blake to a vet min meanwhile Jeff Green and Bruce Brown are absolute steals making the minimum that nobody cried about
Jeff Green is the exact kind of guy who would blow up against the Celtics
"Rondo on Clips, LeBron on Lakers and Jeff Green on Nets give it a good chance"
Jeff Green?
I just think threads like this suggesting Randle as a serious MVP candidate are insulting. The gap between Jokic and Randle is larger than the gap between Randle and Jeff Green.
How bout playing teams in the finals in the WNBA d league era that wouldn’t make the playoffs today?  Imagine being guarded by Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec in finals after Finals yet not even coming close to the finals performances LeGOAT has vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green  Imagine thinking Jordan is the GOAT after 2016. Old lebron &gt; prime Jordan as we saw last year
"All those years of Marv Albert calling Jaylen Brown “Jaylen Green” by confusing him with Jeff Green, and now there’s gonna be an actual Jalen Green"
"Teams need solid reliable guys  like Shaq, CP3 and Jeff Green."
Yeah that’s true I imagine they are going to start with Forbes but harden will hunt him every chance he gets. A positive for the bucks is that Jeff Green injury cause I think he was the Nets best shot of playing small against the bucks and reducing Lopez minutes. It should be an interesting series. I’d probably take the Nets but could go either way.
"They likely won't have Jeff Green, either, though."
... no it’s not.  Harden is coming off an injury.  Durant has missed multiple games this year with (different) injuries.  Kyrie is not the most durable player.    Missing a few games of Jeff Green suck but its way less important than the overall health of the big 3 going into another series.
"Harden, kd, Blake, Joe, kyrie and you want to bring up Jeff Green.  Lmfao like the old warrior fans that brought up bogut in 2016."
"&gt;Did you even watch the game?  I watched the whole game...   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; They were up 20+ in the 4th and left their starters in for like the whole quarter.   That's on Nash, idk why he left them in for so long. Shoulda sat them way earlier but it's whatever  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The Celtics suck right now and still put up 126  I want to point out that most of these came during garbage time. The Nets defense is obviously a concern but they're missing Jeff Green and more importantly their lack of defensive consistency is balanced out by the big 3's insane scoring ability"
"Weird hearing the announcers compare the Nets not having Jeff Green to the Celts not having Kemba, Brown and Timelord like they were even remotely comparable."
"&gt;This is he first time all year we're seeing the nets at full power,   Spencer Dinwiddie is still out and Jeff Green is out now"
I'd be less skeptical about it being mainly fashion if it wasn't the most iconic band shirt in band shirt history.  But who knows! Jeff Green def looks good in it :)
Don't you know? Jeff Green &gt;&gt;&gt; Jaylen...
This series wouldn't even be this close if Jeff Green was available. The Celtics aren't getting the Nets best punch.
6 with Jeff green 7 without
any chance jeff green is actually a pink floyd fan?   I'm thinking no lol
Jeff Green has a check mark in my book as a Cavs fan but seeing him coast on this all-time team contrasted with how much screetime he’s getting is a bit odd and distasteful
"I love Ian Eagle. They showed Jeff Green wearing a Pink Floyd t-shirt and Eagle said ""The Nets forced the Celtics to put up yet another brick in the wall"""
"And Giannis averages 40/11/5 against the Nets this season,and they’ll be without Jeff Green"
Bruh. If Jeff Green is the difference y’all doing something wrong
"If Jeff green is ya downfall on team with Durant, harden and Kyrie than they never deserved to win. They gave up their role players to be top heavy🤷🏽‍♂️"
"damn jeff green yawning at the celtics, massive disrespect"
Y'all accusing Jeff Green of being a Pink Floyd poser?
"Jeff Green rockin the Pink Floyd shirt! Put on some Echoes live in Pompeii if you've never listened to it before, that is some good stuff."
i don’t think you know how important jeff green is to our team
They really going on about Jeff Green like it’s putting their playoff run in jeopardy
"If the Nets can't beat the Bucks without Jeff Green, they deserve to lose"
"Yes, this team can’t beat the bucks without Jeff green"
Yea it is. They need Jeff Green back
Jeff green or Blake LMAO
"No Jaylen, No Kemba, No Rob Williams versus..... No Jeff Green.... And we still hangin"
And we are missing nets legend Jeff green
Jeff green is goated
if i see another nets fans act like missing jeff green is the reason theyre losing im gonna lose my mind. LOOK AT UR ROSTER MY GUY
"I just need a whole summer of Nets fans talking about how a Jeff Green injury cost them a championship when they have KD, harden and kyrie on the same roster. I need it"
Jeff Green
"Yeah, maybe we can give them Giannis for Jeff Green so that it's not such a ""tough tough road"" for the Nets. And Holiday for Joe Harris if you still think KD's road is so tough."
"""resting"" Jeff green and alize, that's even"
"Which team that went deep suffered lots of injuries? Lakers just have AD out. Nets have Jeff Green out. Nuggets have Murray out. Most teams have one or two players out, not lots of injuries."
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
Is Jeff Green hurt??
I just realized nets are playing jeff green at C lmfao
"KD, Harden, and Claxton are all lightyears better as defensive options on Simmons. Hell, even Landry Shamet was better on Simmons than Green was this year. Maybe you've attributed some defensive attributes to Green because he still has crazy hops, but he is legitimately a bad defender. His absence hurts Brooklyn on O, but the only effect it has on D is reducing depth. There's not a single person in the Nets organization or fanbase that has Jeff Green pencilled in as ""defensive stopper/paint deterrent"" against *anyone*, let alone Ben Simmons."
Jeff Green defending Ben Simmons on the perimeter is the Nets best shot at defending him with 1 player  What single player is preventing the Simmons’ drive?
When did Jeff Green become some kind of paint deterrent? His value is on offense. He's probably the 2nd worst defender on the team after DJ.
Nets might have to drop another game to the Celtics so that Jeff Green can recover from his plantar fasciitis to be ready for the Bucks
Jeff green is more important than Donte in that series. Bucks can roll with more Tucker who is a better shooter and is a better option for KD and switching in general. Green is by far their best big and was likely going to see a chunk of time guarding Giannis if not most of the time.
"The Milwaukee Bucks are a much better basketball team than the Boston Celtics, both on offense and defense. They have the personnel to match up with the Nets better than any team other than maybe Philly. They have no interior presence, especially without Jeff Green. The Bucks have Giannis. On top of that, the Bucks are an elite shooting team. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that they will put up a much better fight than the injury ridden Boston Celtics.  I also said **can**, *not* **will**."
Nets may not have Jeff green and he’s their biggest body
Bryn Forbes is a man on a mission and Connaughton has given them good minutes on both ends all year. Nets also might’ve lost Jeff Green. Donte is a loss but not an insurmountable one. Fear the Dear.
"i honestly think the bucks have the best chance to beat them, with the exception of maybe a healthy lakers team. they've basically turned every playoff weakness they had the last few years into a strength. losing donte hurts but the nets are down jeff green and all their stars have been vulnerable to injury"
"Jeff Green against Giannis, Brook, Bobby Portis &amp; PJ Tucker  I dunno the front court for the Nets could be a legitimate problem."
Jeff green is injured. it’ll be deandre/claxton/blake at the 5
Nets will probably not have Jeff Green so the teams are even /s
Blake can make outside shots however(38% from 3 with bkn) and wat happens when bkn goes super small with Jeff green at the 5?  This is going be the series when tucker will have to play some heavy minutes
Jeff green out. He's gonna bully Claxton until he cries.
"I preferred my hometown Detroit Pistons games. Did you watch NBA in the late 80s when MEN played? The game has become one big advertisement. You don't even need to know the game, just memorize some stats. I think Jeff Green called them ""box score fans"""
No Jeff Green at least to start for Brooklyn is a massive part of it.
"Jeff Green should be back by then, right? I think he could alleviate a lot of problems but Brook is going to get what he wants."
jeff green has the biggest heart on the Nets
"Yeah, not having Jeff Green is going to be a key factor vs the Bucks."
Celtics didnt miss the playoffs in 2018. They lost to Bron and jeff green
"Nets can't do much about the switches without Jeff Green. Claxton and Durant aren't fast enough to get under those screens and you can't really put Harden on Tatum. The only guy they can put on Tatum who the C's can't switch is Brown, but he's honestly not really tall enough to guard Tatum that well. It's a perfect situation for Tatum."
I swear Jeff Green is just chilling and then when he plays with Harden in the 2nd unit he turns into prime Vince Carter  Dunks on everyone and everything and then swishes a 3 the next possession
"Also missing Jeff Green, he’d be getting a couple easy pnr assists with him out there"
I mean if you add Harris to that list with Jeff Green out that makes up for like 80+% of their scoring
"Jeff green is really the glue guy in this team in my opinion. Big guy who can drive, shoot, rebound and defend."
"Welp... I kept saying we needed to keep our foot on the gas &amp; get this sweep to be as prepared as possible for the Bucks. Kyrie has to perform better, especially in front of this crowd who wants him to fail so badly. Claxton can't disappear like that. Joe Harris has to look like the guy who lead the league in 3pt percentage. And we need Jeff Green back. Oh, and of course Tatum's 50 burger.  Hopefully we can correct some of this for Game 4."
"18-9 as a stretch big with 41% 3p shooting is a borderline star if not. Plus, they had guys like George Hill, Crowder that they traded, Jeff Green. Flawed and lacking some upper level talent but not dog shit."
"I don’t think their roster is shallow at all. They have great roll players  Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Nick Claxton, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet  Hard to ask for more than that"
"Really happy the Celtics didnt just lay down, if we can force this to six games I’ll count it as a huge win.  But if I’m Brooklyn I’m fucking terrified of Philly and Milwaukee. Kevin Durant and Jeff Green are the only defenders on that roster that aren’t complete negatives. Embiid will get unlimited points against Blake, and they’re not about to wall off Giannis the way Miami did."
Is Jeff Green better than Kevin Durant 🤔🤨
Claxton is not ready for the moment quite yet. Jeff Green really makes a difference because he makes heavy rebounders sit on the bench because they can’t cover him.
I don’t think ppl are talking about Jeff Green being out enough. Without him the Nets legitimately only have 5 players who are playable in the playoffs and one of them is Blake Griffin who was a corpse three months ago.
No Jeff green and Kyrie selling
Jeff Green clearly the mvp of the Nets notice how they alstart losing now.
"What if this is a 4D chess move by the Nets to make this series longer, and thus push the start of the Bucks series to later - allowing Jeff Green to join in time?"
"Ideally Jeff Green,"
Nets bench got exposed today without Jeff Green. Absolute garbage from Shamet and Claxton. It's gonna be rough without him
"Dinwiddie hasn't even played 1 minute this season, DAJ is one of the worst centers in the league who won't get any minutes in playoffs either. Blake is okay as a bench option but bad as a starter. Jeff Green is decent tho but thats it."
"Joe Harris, Blake and DAJ on a veteran deal if need be plus claxton.   Jeff green is also a good rotational piece.  Meth curry, Brown and shamet are nothing special though."
Jeff Green was a fan favorite. Kyrie is a hoe
Wasn't Jeff Green on the Celts? Why all the hate for Kyrie?
"Genuinely hilarious that people thought this Nets team could just suddenly start playing good defense in the playoffs. Milwaukee could/should beat them, especially if Jeff Green is still injured"
Jeff Green was the key to everything
The Celtic Jeff green
we're really missing Jeff Green right now
Jeff Green helped them a lot
nets are missing jeff green right about now
Is Jeff Green injured?
Nets losing on purpose to give jeff green time to get healthy for 2nd round
Yeah but why would you risk more of a workload on your stars (mainly KD who has a history with injuries) for Jeff Green?
Jeff Green is hurt; Claxton is gonna see extended minutes and gonna hafta sink or swim a bit
Will Jeff Green be able to play at all in the second round?
I hope jeff green gets back for the bucks series. Kind of sad watching blake play tbh
Not necessarily... I can see the Nets being extra careful since plantar issues can linger. I would assume it's one of those things that the least amount of pressure Jeff Green puts on that foot the faster the injury will heal (or at least avoid making it more serious).
They don’t need Jeff Green to beat the fucking Celtics.
If the Celtics win tonight they are taking this series in 7.   Jeff Green is a huge loss for Brooklyn.
"Rookie Lebron would have taken that OKC team to 6-7 championships.  Damn, imagine that team...Lebron, Russ, Harden, Ibaka, Thabo, Jeff Green."
"So much anger in this post, Jeff Green is far from washed btw"
lol.  Washed Jeff Green is gonna be such a game changer.  Now they only have KD Harden Kyrie Harris Griffin etc..  They go from massive favourites to 0.1% less massive favourites without Jeff Green.   Could possibly take 5 games instead of 4 to beat the Bucks.  Soul crushing loss.  KD in shambles and calling up Curry
This is also how we feel about facing the Bucks without Jeff Green. I wish both teams were just healthy.
"i heard Jeff Green is out, i think we got this one gang"
Everyone. Mainly KD/Claxton/Jeff Green
Don’t disrespect Jeff Green
No wonder Jeff Green scored 7-8 from three... I mean jesus.
"KD in all honor, but Jeff Green was fire tonight."
Jeff Green*
Then Jeff green would have dropped 50 instead
Where was Portis all game? Brooklyn is out there getting physical and you don’t put “Crazy Eyes” in? Jeff Green said it all in the post-game interview where he said they didn’t make any adjustments and the Nets made them pay. Lopez should have come out in the 4th and MIL should have gone small with Portis.
"So Giannis put on all that weight so he could shoot uncontested 3 balls? Where is this man’s post up game? If you’re gonna iso in the playoffs make sure you’re taking high percentage shots(obviously relative to your skill set) and if you get doubled/tripled then kick it out? Like why does he not play like he’s huge and imposing? Who’s gonna push him around in the paint? KD? Nope. Jeff Green? Nope. Claxton?? He’s amazing on the fast break and in PnR, but man it’s really gotta be frustrating for Bucks fans to witness your star player thinking the only hole in his game is shooting from range. Maybe if he started closer to the basket he would actually develop his touch for the ball with those massive mitts of his. Idk maybe I am ignorant with my analysis, but watching the ending of this game last night was painful and my in-laws are the Milwaukeeans not me."
"How was it embarassing?   It was a 1 possession game with a minute left  Yeah, they had a double digit lead at one point, but then KD went Nuclear, and Jeff Green couldn't miss from deep  They still went basket for basket in the last 4 minutes and lost because of a couple bone headed possessions + KD being KD  If KD misses that top of the key bailout possession, or Green goes 5/8 instead of 7/8 from 3, Bucks win"
"I think people are ignoring that it took a Jeff Green top 10 talent in the NBA game to get this win. Usually when he has a game like that, he will have several d league material ones afterwards. I don’t think there is a player with a higher ceiling and lower floor than him.    Love the guy because he has the ability to be a star randomly, but you should never depend on him being your 2nd best player."
Somebody at some point has to put some respect on Jeff Green.
"Jeff Green is a guy who will give you the world when you need it, but not if you expect him to."
Harden has 1 leg. Its not going to get better. Jeff Green played out of his mind and Kd played the game of his life. Bucks are gonna win the next game.
It took Kd to have the best game in nba history and Jeff Green to become the 2nd coming of Steph Curry to win this game. I dont think Harden will get any better and I doubt Kds play 48 min a game for the next 2. Bucks can still win this series.
Jeff was 7/7 for 3 at one point. dude was fucking money. he’s the only reason the game wasn’t an unreachable blowout in the first. nobody else was hitting shots. nets only had 4 scorers in the first half and KD and Jeff Green we’re 2 of them.
"Someone told me a long time ago that the idea of Jeff Green is better than the actual Jeff Green.  That being said, that comment was made before he got waived from the Jazz and he's reinvented himself as a small-ball 5."
"Explain to me why a few days ago KD was a choker and PJ Tucker and Giannis were the best defenders in the world? Explain to me why Jeff Green all of a sudden is a sharpshooter and Harden on one leg isn't exploitable at all? Joe Harrison and Harden went 1/15 on 3s. And you lost. KD is KD but your team didn't even make it hard for him. If that's the best game plan your team's got, you're donezo. This isn't an over-reaction. It's also not overhyped because it's the fourth year the Bucks look legit and seem to shit the bed in the playoffs. And Giannis is so fucking limited as a basketball player it's not even funny. His BBIQ is nonexistent. Watch the postgame press."
Obviously KD's performance is the highlight of this game but huge shouts out to Jeff green dude was swished every shot in the first half it felt like. Also holy shit Joe Harris was bad
"Spot on, I think Jeff Green is there for his SuperSonics bro KD. They go WAY BACK."
Jeff Green Curry
Jeff green was *7 for 8* from 3 - not too much room for doubling
Jeff Green was better
"LeBron isn’t living in anyone’s head. You giving more credit to Jeff Green for getting the team going shows how rent free KD is in yours, though."
Sorry bucks fans but this is over. Harden scores 5 points and y’all still lost lol. And how do you let Jeff green score 27?
Nets fans better be glad Jeff green came to play cause other than Blake nobody else did anything productive. Budenholzer need to be fired today after that tragedy
"The only reasonable thing is Harden looked beyond awful and who knows if this will change in game 6 and 7, Jeff Green won't be Stephen curry every game and Durant probably can't go the full game dropping 50 each night. So the Bucks still have a good chance to win despite complete other incompetence"
I disagree with you. Harden was not good in game 5 but the bucks treated him like he was healthy and guarded him like he scored 20 points instead of 5 points. The only teammate KD could rely on was Jeff green.
"This is KD's ""2012 Game 6""  But no you don't deserve an apology, because as amazing as he was he doesn't have that stat line nor win the game without James Harden and a crazy outlier game from Jeff Green.   You mentioned Joe Harris going off. That didn't happen.  Enjoy your downvotes. If you repost this I'll downvote you again"
"Jeff""designated Big 3"" Green... XD"
"So if the Bucks choke, that means KD really didn’t win the game, because even with a 49 point triple double, he should’ve lost   Jeff green going 7/8 from 3 doesn’t make up for their poor performances either because we expect him to do that right"
Bucks have it this good?  Blake went 7/11  Jeff Green was 7/8 from 3  KD had one of the best playoff performances of all time  I doubt the Nets have all of those happen at the same time again
"Harden was playing much slower than normal, but was still in control when he was handling the ball or passing the ball. It caused some timing issues between him and Durant early on, but after the half they seemed to both clamp down on the risk taking.  Harden missed some good looks and they all looked a bit short. The bucks couldn’t completely leave him alone. He was still a threat. He had a good 3pt play off a foul on a drive and it pretty much showed they couldn’t completely ignore him.  Defensively, the nets did a good job of helping him and he never really guarded anyone any different than when he was on the rockets teams. He mostly stuck to perimeter defense and switched a lot.  Ultimately his basketball IQ was on display. He moved the ball well and found Jeff Green a bunch of times. I also noticed he wouldn’t feed Blake behind the 3pt line too often. His decision making and control of the game was on full display. The bucks have a problem if he can hit shots in game 6"
This is not a normal performance from Jeff Green
i'll never forget him preventing the celtics from going to the finals in 2018. lebron dominated that game with jeff green.
"but he reinvented bruce brown, uses jeff green beautifully as a small ball 5, and helped create our defensive switching scheme which honestly gives a lot of teams trouble."
"Literally a minute prior, he backed Jeff Green down bit by bit until he was in the center of the paint. Hook shot, money. Don't need to skill your way around, don't need to go through him either."
"He'd literally gotten 2 hook shots over Jeff Green in the previous 4 or so possessions. And he didn't even really play bully-ball, he just won a bit of ground every time he backed down towards the center of the paint until he was in a good spot to release.  So he didn't even need to use footwork to get around the man on one leg -- that the footwork isn't in his bag isn't a problem. He didn't even need to run the guy over -- that he doesn't want to have to shoot free throws isn't a problem either. He literally did what he needed to do against a better defender minutes before."
I’m not sure where else we would’ve put Jrue defensively anyway. Maybe Jeff Green but he was catch and shoot anyway so not like he was driving past anyone.
"As a Celtics fan I feel like I should be rooting against the Nets, but I will never root against Jeff Green. Love seeing him light it up. Also love seeing Durant prove the doubters wrong. I hope Harden heals up and it's Nets vs Clippers in the finals."
"Come on guys. Nets didn't win 4 yet. If harden is still a shell of himself, you expect Durant to have another 50 pt game? And Jeff green to have 25+? Joe harris should play better though.   Bucks in 7, gotta believe it."
Jeff Green won't play the game of his life two games in a row. Bucks in 7
"Watched the entire second half  You can’t be up 30 no matter how well you play if Jeff Green is nuclear and KD is playing the best game of his career   No team would be up 30   Not the KD warriors, the 1993 Bulls   Not the Heatles   Not this Bucks"
If the Bucks lose this series Bud should be fired immediately and they need to make some major player moves. This series is literally being handed to them on a silver platter. Both Harden and Kyrie are hurt so all you have to do is outplay KD. You are supposed to be a defensive team but yet no one can do anything to KD and Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are still being highly productive as well. Losing this series would be like the Warriors still winning the Finals vs Kawhi and the Raptors with Klay and KD out. The Bucks HAVE to win these next 2 games.
Dude just had a damn near 50 point triple double and won with everyone but Jeff Green playing like absolute trash.   The entire world is thinking he’s the best player on the planet.   There’s no way the team that just experienced that is stupid enough to think “if our best player thinks that guy is the best player on the planet then he doesn’t believe in us anymore”   Do y’all think teams were avoiding calling Bron the best player alive when they had meetings and game planned against him?
"Did you come out of that first half thinking KD was playing poorly...? IIRC he had 9 boards 5 assists and was 6/10 from the field for like 17. Him and Jeff Green were literally the only people making shots that first half, and by literally I mean LITERALLY. Maybe he was a bit passive in that first half... but we see why. He played 48 mins and reserved his injury for that absurd second half. Doesn't mean his first half was even close to bad tho."
Giannis get off Twitter.   This is explicitly not what you want.   KD and Jeff Green can’t reproduce that game every night. Just win the next two by sticking to the plan.
"This game I feel is being blown a bit out of proportion. Did the Bucks blow a lead, yes. Is this a hugely important game, yes. Did we have a chance to win the game, yes. But I wasn't even confident we would win if Kyrie and Harden sat. I said it on other comments. Refs love to cater to home team. Home crowd is huge advantage especially this season. Kd had (probably) the best game of his life. Jeff Green started off 7/7 on threes. Harden played. And we still almost won. Everyone here acts like the bucks are prime Warrior's or Bulls. We're not. We're a better than average team with a fantastic star and a coach who can't make adjustments or teach basketball iq to a guy who grew up with zero basketball iq. Almost every win we had this season vs a good team was while the star of the other team was out. Our record is better than we are. Let's not forget people thought we'd get swept by the Heat. Now we supposed to beat the Nets or else the world ends?People act like this was Rockets vs Spurs when they lost by 40 in game 6 and Spurs didn't have Kahwi. I wouldn't call this an epic choke job. I wouldn't say this tarnishes Giannis's career. Does Giannis need to improve in more spots then one? Absolutely. Kd wasn't like 28 till he won his first ring. Are we gonna say that because of OKC his career is ruined and he won't be an all time great? Hell no lol. Fuck didn't the 76ers just blow a 16 point lead to the Hawks.....God damn this sub pisses me off. The hot takes get the most attention. Oh forgot to mention there's still at least a game 6! Lol end of rant sorry"
"Joe Harris has been major cheeks. It’s been one game of Jeff Green, one game of Bruce Brown and one game of Blake Griffin"
Don’t disrespect Jeff Green with a monster performance as well
"I know Jeff Green was making them pay, but seriously, double team KD at half court and let someone else on the Nets beat you."
Rofl I actually like Jeff green a lot. This guy just comes to work and gets on with his shit.
Jeff green went 7-8 from three dummmy made up for it
"The Bucks couldn’t guard the perimeter that wasn’t KD or Harden.  KD did what he had to do with 40+ points. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin provided scoring and 3-point shooting.  It is infuriating to see the Bucks be awful at the perimeter shooting defense, when they should be better than what they are. Jeff Green was hot from the field, how about you guard him? Blake Griffin is hitting a high percentage of 3, why not guard him? They couldn’t even take advantage of Harris hitting bricks, because he was open on a few."
Jeff Green
"Because the Nets are somehow, almost inexplicably, one of the deepest teams in the league. If one or two role players isn't on don't worry they have more. If you told me someone who wasn't KD or Harden went 7/8 from deep I would have said it was Harris. No? Shamet? Really? Well I guess Mike James has been playing we--oh it was Jeff Green. Of course it was.....  You can't just leave these dudes wide open and expect nothing to happen they aren't the Sixers."
Congrats on the win tonight. Durant and Jeff Green played amazing.
"So many things wrong with the Bucks I don't know where to start:  Jrue Bledsoe is not a very smart playmaker. I never knew he was this much of a stupid shot chucker. He was part of a lot of the boneheaded ""plays.""  Giannis once again nowhere to be found in clutch time. Add on top of that the terrible butterfingers turnover in the last minute of the game. If he had a little more patience in the paint, he could be deadly, but he's always either rushing his shot or attempting some ridiculous jumpshot because he can't find anything inside because he can't create anything himself when he's not in transition  Bud should've been fired a long time ago. That dude should never coach an NBA team again. The garbage lineups he was rolling out there in a game 5 was criminal. Plus, playing Giannis like it's a regular season game. Plus, letting KD cook Lopez over and over again. Plus not calling a timeout when the idiots on the court didn't want to close out and just let the Nets' shooters shoot wide open 3s. Get this dumpster fire out of Milwaukee.  With all that being said, KD is a monster. I just wish he could do this more often without superstars all around him (and that includes the deadliest shooters Blake Griffin and Jeff Green)."
KD and Jeff Green both had one of the best games of their entire lengthy careers. While Giannis had actually a pretty good game but mistakes were made in the end and everyone else on his team played below average.
3 on 5. How did they leave Jeff Green open that many times?
Anyone else cringe how they kept trying to say Jeff Green touched it? Giannis just drops the pass.
It’s because Jeff Green does not have the reputation as an elite 3 pt shooter like Joe Harris does. When Harris goes 7-8 he’s doing what the nets paid him to do. If green goes 7-8 it’s amazing because he’s an old journeyman by this point in his career. Kinda like how iguodala used to step up in the warriors later title runs
"And it would've been like Lillard putting up his 55 -- he did everything he could and it wouldn't have been enough.  The Bucks had a 17-point lead earlier in the game and going into halftime, even Barkley was acknowledging how the Bucks were stupid in spite of their lead because it should've easily been between 20-30. They did everything possible down the stretch to lose the game combined with Durant having one of his best games of his career along with Jeff Green shooting lights out for this to occur so I disagree with that assertion."
How sway??? KD just dropped 49 and came back down 17 with Jeff Green and a bunch of trash. Ain’t Nobody that can check KD but any forward that has any pride in their defense steps up. Ain’t no way Draymond watches Wiggins get torched all night the way Giannis left PJ and Middleton
"The Jeff Green slander must end. This man is legit, in his twilight years balling tf out. When he was the Cavs 2nd option he was also on point. Underrated"
"I agree. That's why I made my initial response. I didn't think it was a ""good pass"" I thought it was more of a ""oops I already jumped for a layup but I change my mind coz Jeff Green is such a great defender in the paint, so here you go Giannis"". Giannis was probably expecting him to finish, of course Giannis was looking straight at Middleton, he had the ball. Always keep your eye on the ball."
"&gt; Jeff Green’s best game in his career potentially?  hah, this is the bi annual green game"
"And Jeff green and Kevin Durant both had career nights. Both played one of the best playoff games they have ever played in their lengthy career.   Giannis is only 26 lol the bucks will have plenty more chances in the next 3-4 years, even these next 1-2 games lol. This sub is so over dramatic and negative lol"
"Yeah goddamn, I saw the stat line and was like ""wait Jeff Green is still in the league?"" You love to see it, pretty fucking insane to see them both ball out like that all these years later."
"Yeah, his weaknesses can cause him to come up short. However, are the Bucks in this game, do they gain that massive lead they had, if they don’t have Giannis? Hell, how much different would the game be with a replacement level player for Giannis vs KD going god mode and Jeff Green having the best shooting night of his life. Meanwhile Giannis’ two costars are 15-38 (39.4%).   Multiple bad shots, he was 14-22. Missed free throws, he was 4-7. The turnover was bad, one play. The post fadeaway is brutal, but when you’re 12-17 from 2 it’s one you live with on your second or third last possession, even if there are much better shots.   He came up short. He has flaws. But don’t act like he wasn’t dominating the pace and doing damage for 90% of this game. It’s not a night to hang your hat on, but don’t get it twisted that it was a top 10 player performance. KD just happened to do KD things, and Giannis ain’t KD"
jeff green..... once every 3 years he has a game where he tries
why not switch him on to jeff green at least?
Turned back the clock to pre-draft Jeff Green
Numbers can lie. Khris played pretty good. Giannis was actually good. KD and Jeff Green were nuclear.  Bud was a gimp.
"Everyone forgets Jeff Green was the 2nd best player on the 2018 Cavs roster lmao. Kevin Love disappeared and Jeff Green showed up big against the Pacers, Raptors, and Celtics en route to Golden State."
The first half was basically just 5v2 with KD and Jeff Green playing alone
"Coach Bud, KD, and Jeff Green in that order"
Jeff green turned into klay Thompson
"Attack harden, run actual plays, put giannis on KD more and go small if Jeff green starts to go off again. And try to limit mental mistakes: there were so many stupid fouls, bad/dropped passes, or that pj tucker inbounds play where they threw the ball away for no reason"
Jeff Green got hot from 3 and bucks offense was pretty mediocre
Yes but I also expect Jeff Green and Blake Griffin to not hit every 3.
"Conveniently ignoring that Jeff Green went 7/8 from 3 for your narrative, lmao"
I get struggling to find an answer for KD but Jeff green was absolutely torching them and he just left his big slow center on him the whole night when he clearly couldn’t keep up
"How bout next time, you guys figure out a way to keep a 17 pt lead vs Durant and Jeff Green playing 2v5 for 48 min."
He posted up Jeff Green and used his height advantage to hit a jump hook just a few plays earlier (to cut the lead to 2).   That would be much better than the fadeaway he took.
Bucks vs. KD.  And Jeff Green.   And the Bucks lost lol.
"Someone drug-test Jeff Green, then pregnancy test his significant other."
"Yeah this is dumb, they don’t win this without Jeff Green but it’s not even a game without KD putting up an all time performance. I get that KD is always good but this is still a massive outlier performance."
"Jeff green and KD were like the only 2 players who could buy a bucket in the first half. If Uncle Jeff doesn't step up, nets lose this game by 20+ easily."
"KD's amazing carry is overshadowing it, but Jeff Green had a great game too"
"No one:  Absolutely no one:  Jeff Green: ""I'm Steph Curry"""
Solid bench would be accurate if more than just Jeff Green scored off the bench.
"Jeff Green is awesome, loved him on the Cavs too.  He's clutch in big games"
Defense is not really the issue you live with KD getting hot and if Jeff Green goes off you can't do much.    Offensively it's a true and dishonorable shambles. Tears continuously flow but the offense does not.
KD is also 32. And is coming off of a devastating injury. Blake has duct taped knees. Jeff Green has heart issues.    How tf Bucks coming out here losing to three geriatric dudes lmfao
I still say people highly underestimate Jeff Green lol
"funny thing is, the next play he attacked Jeff Green who is a decent tall decent defender but didnt do it against a 30% shorter Harden thats when I think they deserver to lose that game"
Jeff Green was in the same draft class as KD
"Coach Bud is the worst Coach I’ve ever seen in my life. You ALWAYS force the others to beat you, especially when you’re starting with a 17 point lead. The star always gets doubled &amp; blitzed, you don’t play KD 1 on 1 &amp; let him get into rhythm. Harden is playing with 1 leg, the role players were bricking besides Jeff Green &amp; you gotta live with that. KD should’ve been getting denied for 80% of this game."
"Harden was a straight up negative in this game and KD absolutely balled out with basically only Jeff green. Like damn, I’m a Cavs fan and remember the hurt KD put on me, I don’t know why a Celtics fan this salty lol."
Giannis for Jeff Green
Jeff green just had the game of his life and no ones gonna remember it
"We had no one stepping up the last two games. Even in his masterpiece of game 5, he was throwing passes to Jeff Green and setting up Joe Harris with easy inside layups. And even then he had to pop off for 49 points lol"
"Reassess what? Passing it to an open Joe Harris for him to brick another 3? I much rather have KD playing hero ball. Jeff Green, Kyrie, Harden were all hurt. Is KD supposed to rely on Joe Harris, Landry Shamet and a washed up blake griffin?"
Scottie didnt even watch the matches or something. 6th game KD passed to Jeff Green cuz he was already scoring on his own. Game 7 nobody was hitting anything why would you pass. I rather go out with my best player shooting than the 4th best player shooting an air ball.
"Yeah thats kinda the whole point. I disagree with it being a good look given the context. Yeah it's a good look during the course of the game..not in this scenario being down 1 with 20 seconds left and he hasn't hit a 3 all game. Yeah it's a good look if he had at least hit a few 3s during the game like Terrance Mann, Jeff green, and Bojan on the jazz when they all when off. Those 3 were on fire and the jazz ended up losing by leaving a red hot Terrance Mann wide open again and again. It matters if if a player is cold or hot.Was it a good look, when the jazz lost because Royce o Neal was wide open on a 3 ? No , I think it was by design to make him hit that shot over anyone else.. The opposing coach would love a cold , average 3 point shooter taking the shot over a red hot Bojan. Noticed how after the game was out of reach the next possession for the jazz, Bojan drilled a 3 in front of 2 defenders.   Rather than just flipping on sportscenter and seeing this ""good look"". It wasnt a coincidence that Pat was left wide open, it was good coaching by the Hawks. He actually shot it and airballed with 20 seconds left. What a good look for the hawks lmao"
"Lol, hes so fucking far from the truth. KD couldn't trust his teammates because Harden was injured, Harris was ice cold, Bruce Brown is an average shooter and Jeff Green was on and off. KD SHOT 50% FROM THE FIELD. Prime Lebron couldn't have done better imo"
"With how Simmons played this year, they’d be lucky to get Jeff Green&amp;Claxton for him"
Jeff Green never played with Kyrie on the Cavs.
"Lol what??   There was only one team committing murder in that series.   PJ Tucker raking his fingers across the eyes of KD, and then Harden both multiple times.   Giannis throwing 1-2 hard spinning elbows every game, absolutely nailing Jeff Green, KD, Blake Griffin, and Bruce Brown in the face multiple times. That shit causes stone cold knockouts in MMA but for Giannis it's just a ""basketball play"".   Giannis undercutting and injuring Kyrie by ""boxing him out"" while he was in midair. And then doing the exact same thing to Harden in game 5, lucky for him he didn't get injured.   I cannot believe a Bucks fan is crying bloody murder. You have the most reckless, aggressive superstar the NBA has seen in decades."
"If they go small, I would expect to see a lot of him picking on Morris like he did last year against Covington and Jeff Green"
"The list of people I mentioned (plus Jockic and Booker) are the next line of Superstars. As long as they don't get hurt they will be the guys taking over from the Lebron, KD and Curry era which is starting to wrap up before our eyes.  This isn't just fluke Jeff Green 43 point game from 2013.  Trae can perform in the big moments as the beat player like any other ""superstar"". I don't see how saying I would take Trae as the star to build a team around is a knee jerk reaction. Especially with the fact that he seems to be loyal and truly enjoys playing for his team."
"Middleton? It's probably because there's no former Celtic on Atlanta (afaik).  Against Brooklyn, you could've probably just shown him a picture of Jeff Green or Kyrie in a C's jersey, and his Celtic-Killer Mode would activate.  No option for that this series."
"I mean OKC that year was also disgusting. Maybe a little too young to classify as a super team but they made the finals the year after.   KD, Russ, Harden, Ibaka and Jeff Green balled the fuck out."
"What amazes me is that they still had some depth after the trade. Jeff green, Blake griffin, even Bruce Brown and Claxton  stepped up this playoffs. You just can’t win when 2 of your starters are injured, especially when those 2 starters are also your second and third options.  But seriously, the depth they had before the trade was insane…"
2022 Jeff Green
"That’s cool and all, but this dude’s still talking about Jrue Holiday hitting a couple shots in the fourth being “lucky” like he’s some random scrub. That’s clearly stupid as shit.  Could have won the series comfortably in six if Jeff Green didn’t go 7/8 from three in game 5, but Jrue Holiday scoring 8 points in a quarter is lucky. Come on."
"That series was also basically Giannis vs KD. Some nights Middleton showed up, some nights Jeff green, Blake or Bruce brown showed up."
"I have watched Wiggins a great deal this season and he does not look any different than he did in Minnesota. 5 RPG, 2.4 APG, 70% FT, and defensive metrics don't think he's a great defender. He's not an awful player necessarily but he is below average at shooting, rebounding, passing, and finishing. It's hard to say that he's a hustle player when he doesn't get rebounds, loose balls, screen assists, charges, or anything of that nature. He is similar to a Jeff Green type player, a rotational contributor on a good team."
Lol y’all just looking at the scores in those games.   Nobody realizes it was basically a Giannis vs KD series. Middleton stepped up every now and then just like Jeff Green and Blake did for them and even Bruce Brown at times.   I would be absolutely surprised if we continue to play that bad in this series and if we do we might as well not even think about the finals. The team that faced the Nets are not even close to what this team is capable of.   No offense to Trae but going from KD to Trae young will be a huge advantage for this team. Trae is more likely to have an off game than KD was.
It’s Jeff green
Playoffs is a diffferent beast. Having even one huge liability shooting wise can hurt your offense tremendously. Our best lineups were always 5 out with Jeff green at the 5
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
"Completely different from the “win or your legacy is fucked” type pressure bron was facing   Also kd was playing at home and had Jeff green going off  Bron had bosh who was was just coming back from injury off the bench, and wade who was terrible"
Fuck Pat Bev  I'll never forgive him for what he did to Westbrook  I'll never forgive him for what he did to Jeff Green
Not in the playoffs though  God I don’t miss having Jeff Green on the team
"Jeff Green in a Celtics uni had a tough shot in the baseline corner on an inbound vs the Heat. Don’t remember the passer but something says it was Rondo, that’s gotta be up there  e: it was Gerald Wallace lmfao"
I am getting Jeff Green/Tyson Chandler vibe from that dunk
"Tnt has the better halftime and post game show but espn has jeff green, mike breen."
Lol haven’t seen a single person say “bucks won oh well” instead it’s playing the what if game. Injuries are apart of every sport but I’ve never seen people act like it mattered more than y’all are with this series. Why y’all wanted a fucking superteam to advance is beyond me. Let’s not act like it was basically Giannis and Khris vs KD the entire series and some games Jeff Green or Bruce Brown. Hardly any role players stepped up at in this series on both teams.   But to your other point if you haven’t realized Bud isn’t a good playoff coach until now you’re blind.
"They were only one of the best teams when injured because of Durant. One leg Harden was nowhere near his usual self and the rest are role players, the reliable ones being Griffin. Jeff Green has a great game in game 5 but there's a reason he barely played in game 7."
"not when you realize the team he has and the team he was going up against  this is after playing 82 games, and carrying hard in the road to the finals in two 7 game series.   not close at all indeed. KD stans are crazy. Not to mention KD had Jeff green going off and bron had love who went 1 for 8 from three and super trash defense"
I'd much rather Jeff Green
I sure did watch the Bucks lose to 34 year old Jeff Green and Durant with no Harden or Kyrie.
"Tired of the Harris talk honestly. I mean for better or worse that's kind of the Bucks' defensive scheme, give up open shots to not great shooters which mostly was Jeff Green, Blake, Bruce Brown. They all had their moments hitting shots still but they aren't statistically above average shooters. Harris definitely should have hit more but it's not like he was just bricking 30 open threes, he had a lot of focus on him from the Bucks. The handful of wide open looks he got were broken down loose ball plays and he generally shrunk in the moment. Playoffs are a different game and he got in his own head, oh well.  Hawks have more shooters but the Bucks have been helping much less on defense and giving up less open threes from simple ball movement. Sure Hawks will get hot but making the Bucks pay? Wouldn't worry about it for the length of the series, their defense is way too strong."
"Kd still had kyrie for most of the playoffs and harden came back and offered what he could. Nets had great role players like Blake and green.   The lakers had no spacing. The nets have way better shooting. Fucking Jeff green had like 7 threes in game 5, nobody is capable of doing that on the lakers. Joe Harris is always here attention even if he sucked  Kd has never carried a team as bad as the lakers. He wouldn’t do shit on the team without AD"
I’d give the  edge to the sixers support just off of Seth playing amazing. Tobi was alright. Tbf to the nets tho Blake griffin was playing pretty nice and Jeff green was big in game 6. If joe Harris looked like his normal self I feel like it’d be pretty even since the sixers supporting cast outside of Tobi and Seth didn’t do much and Danny was out
"Nah man fuck you. It’s basketball convo, like we can’t have a debate here? Like ok I think Jeff Green best contract in the league hur dur . Fuck off"
"who's in the market this free agency that you could get/would want to get? i don't see Jeff Green or Blake leaving, I think you guys really need some quality rim protection at least."
What do you think about him only playing Jeff Green 13 minutes?
"&gt; Bruce Brown is a 6’5” PF/C   He played 98% of his minutes at one of the guard spots according to BBREF. This narrative that he was playing the 5 is just a narrative. He played the dunker's spot offensively at times, but he wasn't the rim protector on defense.  Of his 1450 minutes, almost 900 were with a traditional center. 800 were with Blake or Jeff Green. 1500 minutes total between Durant, TLC, and Harris (all forwards). There were another nearly 300 minutes with random F/C types.   You get into the data, and he played with 3 other forwards/centers at pretty much all times."
"I think a team of Westbrook, Durant, Harden, Serge Ibaka, and Jeff Green could win a championship. If you want to play on easy mode, then they could sign Nick Collison out of retirement"
Bruce Brown is a 6’5” PF/C who had a great year because he was surrounded by multiple super stars.   Brown doesn’t have nearly the same production on any other team since he wouldn’t be able to operate like he did in Brooklyn. Not even like he’s this amazing Defender who makes All Defensive teams.    Jeff Green will be 35yrs old in August. He was solid but he’s also getting old and nearing retirement with every game. Who knows what his market is.   Blake obviously doesn’t have it in him to be a top 3 player day in and day out for a team competing for a Championship. He’s a serviceable role player at this point of his career who can have a few big games.    Nets this Offseason should have the Bi-Annual and Tax MLE (which can be split in 2) to attempt to sign Free Agents.   Bi-Annual (2y/$7.4m)   Tax MLE (3y/$18m)   Plus if Dinwiddie agrees to a Sign and Trade the Nets can then fill out their roster with a Trade Exception like Boston did with Hayward when they helped him get to Charlotte which led to the Fournier trade.
I think it’s clear next season they’ll win (assuming health which isn’t always a great assumption). When you have three max players your window just gets smaller because guys get paid and you have to figure out how to keep filling in guys as vet mins.   Guys like Bruce Brown and even Jeff Green will want to get paid. Who knows what Blake decides on. Blake gave up $13 million to come to the Nets and could probably command $7-$10 million in the open market. Ask KD/Harden/Kyrie despite the massive amount of money they have made if they’d take a $20 million discount. Doubt it.   So realistically all this season did is take a year of dominance off the table. I assume their window is probably another 2-3 years before they’d need to make some tough decisions as to whether this big three is viable going forward. Anything less than 2 titles is a disappointment.
"The only good players there are Jeff Green and Blake + like you said Jeff Green was injured. Harris is a constant playoff underperformer and Harden makes Bruce Brown look good, other than that he's an average role players. The Bucks are an overrated ass team who've been lucky with their opponents having shit injury luck. They'll get beat by the hawks in 6."
Blake was good. Bruce Brown is good. Harris is good (despite having a bad series). Jeff Green would’ve contributed if he weren’t injured as well. The Nets are not the 2011 Heat. They just had really bad injury luck.  You don’t need 10 good players. The Nets had an elite starting 5 with everyone healthy and at least 3 good bench players (with a couple just ok bench guys as well). That’s more than good enough to win.
&gt; well-rounded supporting cast  Yeah gonna have to disagree here. Joe Harris was a walking brick all series. Bruce Brown single handedly choked game 3. Blake Griffin was alright. Jeff Green was playing on 1 leg and only played like 4/7 games. Everyone else on the team was a nobody + Harden is not built for the playoffs.
"People are heavily underrating that Nets supporting cast.  Blake Griffin, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green along with either Kyrie or Harden is an insanely good roster next to Kevin Durant."
Jeff green too
Jeff Green said I sung like a bird and cocked like a rooster at a restaurant in Orlando
"Blake put up a fight, but if Jordan was playing, it would have essentially been a worse version of Giannis destroying hobbled Jeff Green in the paint.  Giannis might have beat Harden in series scoring."
the role players aren't a problem IMO.  Joe Harris was HORRENDOUS this series but he would be picked up by every team in the league.  dinwiddie was hurt and unfortunately probably will sign elsewhere.  shamet has been a starter around the league.  TLC has been good.  Jeff Green and Griffin are solid.    I think nash needed to switch up from harris in games 6 and 7.  TLC absolutely should have been given some run.
I think Harden really enables a lot of the role players on the Nets to be consistently better.  Having him hurt and not be able to playmake to his normal extent negatively impacted most of the role players outside of that random Jeff Green game where he went off.
"That's the issue tho. Simmons could be a GOAT role player if he stepped into a Jeff Green role and just took minimums for good teams year after year, but his supposed potential is simply too high for him to ever be a non-starter. I would like to see him play the 4 on a non-contender to see if he's salvageable though"
"He did okay. I think he missed a trick by keeping Harris in the game so long and not putting in Jeff Green. His coaching staff is very good so it is hard to tell how good of a coach he is but man management seems to be quite good.   Having said that, with a stacked team like that, the goal was a championship so he failed."
Again he was being guarded by Blake griffin and Jeff green and the incredibly weak nets front line.
"At the time, the Nets were fine and they already had Blake and Jeff Green. Tucker would've been redundant."
Hawks are obviously less talented but the offense could give them a real issue. More of the same perimeter based schemes that got the Bucks beat the last 2 years and almost this year  Also Capela is a great defensive anchor for the team. Gonna be much harder for Giannis to score on him than Blake and Jeff Green
We had Jeff Green last season. He wasn't that good for us.
"You just made me realise there are no Greens left, now that Danny, Jeff and JaMychal have been eliminated this round. First time since 2012 there has been no Green in the finals."
Jeff Green in 2011 when he was traded from OKC to Boston in exchange for Perkins and Nate Robinson  Danny Green was a rookie on the Cavs in 2010 when Shaq was traded (by Steve Kerr) from the Suns to the Cavs
Jae Crowder or Jeff Green?
"Well, how about in the playoff series the lack of adjustments, or failure to take advantage of your strengths over the opponent's weaknesses.  For one, Brook Lopez is a great post scorer, he has been his entire career. The Nets, throughout the series, were guarding him with either Kevin Durant, Jeff Green or Blake Griffin (Occasionally with Claxton), these players should all be food for Brook Lopez inside. To that point, if you go back and look through the games, Brook scored a lot of points whenever he caught the ball in the paint (Except very late in game  7). Why did Bud not set up some plays to take advantage of this size mismatch in the post to draw fouls &amp; score points, especially when the 3 point shooting was failing in games 1 &amp; 2?(Lopez had a great game in the paint, but none of it was from designed play)"
No there is not. Danny green and Jeff green were the other two
Jeff Green coulda made the difference
"I think it's a fairly simple if not a difficult task. They have to resign Conley and pick up a league average small ball 5 when teams play Gobert off the court. Someone like a PJ tucker, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin,  or Batum type player who could come in for spot minutes.  Their best bets:  * Resign Conley * Let Niang walk * Sign some kind of small ball 5  Losing Conley is going to set them way back because there is no other PG with his skill who's gonna sign with them.   I know Gobert is an elite 5, but Snyder has to come to his senses and adjust down when need be."
"So Sean Marks shouldn't have been close?   Traded for James Harden, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet. Extended Joe Harris. Signed Jeff Green. Added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in the buyout market. Put together the most stacked coaching staff of all time in Steve Nash, Mike D'Antoni and Jacque Vaughn.  But your saying that Jones adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder to the roster is such an incredible feat, that despite every roster move the Nets made, ""no one should've been close"" to what Jones did?"
Jeff Green is one that comes to mind
Jeff green?
KD almost hit two game winner / game tying shots in the same game. Man dragged a one legged harden and jeff green to game 7 against the top seed. Give em some respect.
"it was 4 firsts (and 6 total picks), at the time the Celtics did not have the Kings pick (from the Fultz deal) so the Nets' pick(s) would've had to have been included along with some of the Celtics' own picks and possibly the Memphis pick they acquired for Jeff Green in 2015."
"56 win team in 2011. 3rd in East.  40 wins before 20 losses.  Rondo, Ray Allen, Pierce, KG, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley.  Still a legit team.  2012 they weren’t as great but only 7 losses more than the Heat. They were playoff built. Still a contender in my view"
They gonna be thinking about why Jeff Green didn't get shots in that game all off season.
I guess I just don’t see the point of dogging on a role player for one bad series. That’s why they’re role players.   Jeff Green had exactly 1 good game FWIW and didn’t even attempt a shot in game 7. Harris had two good games to start the series.
Yeah $3-$5 million? He was their starting C. Stretch big. Good passes. Plays good defense if he’s allowed to foul all game which he is for some reason. This is what happens with the stigma of buyouts. It’s why Jeff Green has been on minimums for a while. Once you take a low contract you rarely get a new big one.
"Your roster wasn't paper thin though? Blake Griffin was great for you guys, Jeff Green was solid and had that huge game, Bruce Brown was solid, you guys would've had Dinwiddie if he hadn't gotten a season-ending injury at the start of the year, Aldridge retired midseason, Joe Harris randomly forgot how to shoot, Landry Shamet's a quality bench player.  You guys just got unlucky, I really don't think the answer was keeping additional bench players instead of Harden."
"Indeed its amazing, but that just make KD more of a hell of a player since he carried them. NOT saying he didnt had help (jeff green, blake Griffin) but i wouldnt say the same for Harris or even Bruce brown they were horrible at key moments"
"I got the pressure thing, do believe its real. But they are pros, they got a big bag every year so if they are not buit for this nobody is, and they were not the second best player since Griffin step up, Jeff Green on game 5 and Harden did played something. So i believe the pressure were higher but not enough to be an excuse."
"The original statement makes no sense though. How can Brown take all of Harris' min when they were on the court together? If he said Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, etc or someone who didn't play then sure but not Brown. That's like saying Harden should have taken all of KD's min lmfao."
Who should get those shots instead? Injured Jeff Green? Joe Harris?   Or do you want KD hoisting up 40 shots a game despite being gassed with the amount he was already putting up?
"Never once in any of my 20 replies in this thread did I say KD and Harden doesn't get BS calls for them. I'm saying KD was held 6 times and didn't get the call.  Of course Harden flops. I never typed I like that crap. It's horrendous. Middleton flops, Holiday flops, Blake flops. I can't say who else on BRKLYN may flop, ya know why? Because Nash is an idiot and can't comprehend rotation...every player flops and throw their arms because the refs call it.   Jeff Green was held on the wrist 3 times when Giannis went baseline and giannis wasn't called for an offensive foul."
"Well all these guys had plenty of rest. Harden maybe should have rested even more to prevent that hamstring injury coming back. Kyrie was stepped on to roll his ankle. That not a conditioning fault on his part. And KD was clearly fine after his rest.  Look at the minutes played on the bench...ya 3 max contract guys getting enough rest and staying healthy is absolutely all you need for the playoffs. Not to mention the bench for the Nets was quite good, Jeff green, Claxton, Shamet, Bruce Brown, hell the nets should’ve had Lamarcus Aldridge if he didn’t have medical complications."
Jeff Green is a weird case since he always has 1-2 Jeff Green games in the playoffs. He’s never really been a reliable role player though.
jeff green needed to play more
No idea why Jeff Green didn't play more. Take Harris out
"Love, TT, Korver who was great that run? It's also weird that you think 34 year old Jeff Green is more likely to show up than 31 year old Jeff Green.   &gt;So you're making your choice off of one game where Bron had his best game ever and still lost despite KD having an off night (26 points on 8-22)? What if KD plays like he did on game 5 and LeBron has an off night, do the Cavs still beat the Nets?  No, I'm making the choice based off the consistent dominance he had the entire run. In a 2018 Cavs vs 2021 Nets hypothetical, people might assume KD will match LeBron as a counter. I'm using the extreme example of Game 1 2018 to show that LeBron made that game competitive (and basically won) against KD + superteam, so take away the superteam and LeBron wins convincingly. Give KD a great night instead of an off-night, it still wouldn't close that gap enough. That was the year where LeBron put up a historic scoring run, and still had his elite playmaking where he raised everyone else on his team. That puts him in positions to win as long as he isn't going against the greatest team in NBA history."
It's no different as Jeff Green going for 30 and 90% for 3pt
"&gt; Who do you think would win, 2018 Cavs or 2021 Nets with their Game 7 team? No Kyrie, Harden playing injured on a Grade 2 hamstring sprain.   Could go either way, I'd lean towards Nets because Blake and Jeff Green are more likely to show up than any of the role players on the Cavs   &gt; Considering what LeBron did against the Warriors in Game 1 who had KD along with Steph, Draymond, and Klay, I lean towards the Cavs.   So you're making your choice off of one game where Bron had his best game ever and still lost despite KD having an off night (26 points on 8-22)? What if KD plays like he did on game 5 and LeBron has an off night, do the Cavs still beat the Nets?"
Jeff Green is the one of the most likeable dudes in the league. Every team would want a guy like him too.
"Freak injury with Kyrie, four seperate incidences with the same hamstring  for Harden (grade 2 apparently), Jeff Green missing 4 games with a plantar strain, Dinwiddie injury, LMA retirement (glad hes fine and with his family).  This is what it takes to point at our decisions and say this idea is flawed."
The Nets seemed like they would be unstoppable (&amp; probably would have been without the injuries). 2/3 of the big 3 plus Spencer. Jeff Green also had an injury. This series almost had Warriors vs Raptors vibes.
I get hating Harden/Kyrie/Blake and even Joe Harris. Jeff Green and Spencer Dinwiddie are cool. Bruce Brown’s hustle is respectable too. The rest of the role players just don’t get enough exposure to hate lol
Absolutely criminal of Steve Nash to leave Jeff green in that long claxton should have gotten way more minutes
"I don’t think it was a more talented team…(Cavs 2018) harden was hurt and was terrible (justified) and harris Griffin and Jeff green is definitely comparable to…Jeff green, hill, Korver, Clarkson, love"
"Jeff green was hurt too, he pushed it in g5 and wasn't able to make an impact the rest of the series."
"Jeff green was our closer all year and was too hurt to play in crunch time after g5, harden was injured, dinwiddie was injured, and Kyrie.  Shit was brutal, KD had to go fucking ballistic for it to be close."
Why even include Jeff Green?
"I said to my friend before the game the Bucks would win because the Nets only won game 5 due to Jeff Green shooting 7/8 from 3, not KD's 49, and in order to win this game Joe Harris would have to make his 3s.  1 minute left in OT, 111-111, Joe Harris wide open 3 he missed."
Anybody else notice that Jeff Green just standing there in the corner just watching after KD shot that ball?  He needs to hustle and be ready for a possible rebound /put back.  Witch I think he might have been in a great position to do.  I feel he almost should be at fault for this outcome for the lack of effort on that final play witch could of been the difference between winning and losing
"A super team Nets team needed an injured Jaylen Brown, an injured Kemba, an injured Robert Williams, and the refs in order to beat the Celtics. We can come up with hypotheticals all day long. Nets are going to probably lose Bruce Brown, Dinwiddie, and possibly Blake Griffin and Jeff Green in the off season. Also Kyrie Durant and Harden are getting up there in age and it’s no guarantee they will stay healthy. I think this was the Nets year to win it"
Jeff Green and Mike James and Spencer Dinwiddie. Jarret Allen and Caris Levert were also super likeable during their nets stints.
"Well I mean....Jeff Green, Harden both playing injured and Kyrie got taken out of the game. Let's not act like the Bucks didn't get very lucky with the Nets being injured"
"Vince, MJ, Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Rose, JR, Gerald Green, Jeff Green, Blake, PG."
Don't forget Jeff green tho
"Ray Allen for Jeff Green  Cs got their Big3 and Thunders (Sonics at the time) started rebuilding with KD. Jeff Green alone wasn't impressive, but as a consequence, they got to draft Westbrooks and Harden in the following years. It won't happen if they had kept Ray Allen + KD duo. So eventually the rebuild was super successful."
"When did Jeff Green win MVP 😳😳  If we're gonna be even more technical, Jeff Green was a draft night trade, was drafted more recently than KD, and because he came off the bench while KD was in the starting lineup, he's your most recent rookie"
"I know that posting up Brook creates spacing issues with Giannis on the floor, but I was legit screaming at them to give him 1 post touch when they were guarding him with Jeff Green against the Nets."
"Once a player takes a pay cut once, it's hard to escape that image to GMs. Players like Jeff Green, who should be paid well above the vet min, will continue to get those contracts and nothing more due to their past contract history."
Jeff Green would show up one day and one up Lebron and come back the next day as a guy who seemed to have no recollection of what the game of basketball was
Jeff Green is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma
"idunno, jeff green is similar (or better) and he’s been making minimum money for years."
"I do not mean this as an insult, but you need to understand how the cap works in the NBA.   Hard caps are only triggered if you use the non tax payer MLE, sign and trade, or bi annual exception.   Otherwise, you can resign your own players and go over the cap. Your penalty is the luxury tax.   160m is a lot but they wouldn't even be the highest in the NBA.   Next season if the Warriors do not resign Kelly Oubre or Kent Bazemore, they are at 168m.   The Nets if they do not retain Spencer Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, they are at 150m with 7 players on their roster."
They didn’t have Jeff green but they did have Reggie Jackson in 2012 which is interesting. I’m thinking they win at least one ring but it would’ve been tough competing with golden state.
He injured Jeff green and mocked him. Mocked Chris Paul last game. Broke bookers nose. Injured Westbrook. Injured Lebron. He’s clothesline’s Conley. Do I need to go on? Open ur f eyes
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"So you're ignoring how important Deandre Hunter was for the Hawks as a perimeter defender, how injured Bogi had been for the last two weeks, and how Trae looked after getting his injury even if he played? I won't even mention Reddish.  Embiid having a torn miniscus isn't a key injury? What about Danny Green?  You don't think CONLEY is key for the Jazz? You didn't see Mitchell's ankle?   Harden, Jeff Green, and Kyrie were all injured.  The Lakers had Lebron trying to recover from his ankle sprain and then AD goes out with a groin injury.  The Clippers lost Kawhi, just lost Zubac, and Morris had been hobbled.  The Nuggets were never even close to 100% going into the post season.   Like, you're just wrong lmao.  In literally no way is this like ""any other yeae."" It is OBJECTIVELY the most top players to be hurt in a single playoffs.  This season is an outlier. Get over it."
Don't forget Jeff Green and Spencer Dinwiddie
"1. That is for players who are guaranteed a spot on NBA rosters. ""Players that are signed by to standard G League deals currently make $7,500 for the month or $35,000 for the year"".

You forget that most NBA players, if not all, have expenses and people they're beholden to that you and I don't. What might seem like a lot of money to you or I is not a lot to them. People live their lives on different levels. What Jeff Bezos might casually decide to buy is unfathomable to you or me as a casual purpose. Have some empathy for people who aren't in your *exact* monetary situation; life isn't automatically easier because you have more money, of course. 3. The point isn't that NBA players are richer than average people. Of course they are. The comparison is not between NBA players and regular people, but between NBA players and NBA *owners*, who are absurdly wealthy compared to the players and always underpay them. The players are on the side of labor here. We should be supporting the labor side. 4. I'm not making NBA players ""appear helpless"" or ""stupid"". NBA players are accomplished human beings who work extremely hard for a number of years to reach the level they have achieved. But the CBA negotiations are designed for them to fail and not get paid what they're worth. The fight for NBA players to be paid more and not overworked as much is the fight for *all* workers to get paid what they're worth and not overworked as much. If you can't see that, then you're blinded by some illogical need to suck up to billionaires."
kevin love is no better than Jeff Green was for the Nets this postseason
"Lakers - AD, LeBron (played through injury)  Nuggets - Murray, Barton  Clippers - Kawhi, Morris (played through injury), Zubac, Ibaka (out for series)  76ers - Embiid (played through injury), Danny Green  Hawks - Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Bogdanovic (played through injury)  Bucks - Giannis, DiVincenzo (out for series)  Knicks - Robinson  Nets - Kyrie, Harden (played through injury), Jeff Green  Jazz - Conley, Mitchell (played through injury)  Mavs - Luka (played through injury)  Heat - Oladipo  Celtics - Jaylen, Kemba  Wizards - Avdija, Thomas Bryant, Bertans  Suns - Payne, CP3 (played through)"
Some poor personel decisions in the playoff series against an opposing coach who was renowned for incompetence.      Why waa he playing Joe Harris so much? Jeff Green so little. Overall really poor given their talent.
Not your stars tho. That’s like saying Sixers lost Danny Green and Nets lost Jeff Green..
Jeff Green?
Gallinari and Jeff Green are the kings of randomly playing like stars
"Why would you start all 3 of AD, Ibaka, and Zubac? Bench Zubac, start KCP or Barton. That Eastern team is also super tiny, don’t forget that Jeff Green was also injured, I would start him and move Dinwiddie to the bench."
Don’t forget Jeff green. But somehow all of that is nullified by the bucks missing donte
"Idk this bucks team really isn’t that good, remember they just blew like a 20 point lead to Kevin Durant and Jeff green"
Jeff Green too
Fucker did the same thing when he injured Jeff Green earlier this season  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwC6rXkEXGo  He's an absolute douchebag.
"Lots of people thought that the Bucks were the only team capable of beating the Nets prior to that series.       Bucks played poorly and shot terribly, and won in 7 with the nets missing 1/3 stars each game. (and hobbled Harden)  You can't change one what if at the literal start to the series and then assume everything else stays the same.  What if the bucks shot well?  What if Jeff Green didn't go 7/8 from 3 in game 5?     The nets should be favored in a rematch with the same lineups for sure but its not like the bucks are incapable of beating them.  This sub just has an infamous recency bias, and a team's most recent performance is how this team thinks they always play"
"Caron Butler, Matt Barnes, Luc Mba Moute, Danny Granger, Reggie Bullock, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, Josh Smith, Lance Stephenson, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson. Who was their missing piece in my opinion? Joe Ingles who they had and cut from the team without even touching the floor."
"I was just wondering who could possibly be the last person Shaq played with that could keep the streak going after this season, strangely enough it is probably LeBron. But Avery Bradley was the youngest player he played with as far as I can see born in 1990.   The only possible people would be Rondo, Robin Lopez, Jeff Green and Dragic. Everyone else I think is out of the league. Only other person would be Wade if he unretired, but that ain't happening."
"Yes, decimated.  They went up 2-1 missing Harden, Dinwiddie, and Jeff Green.  Kyrie got hurt midway through the second quarter of game 4.    &gt; Harden + KD last 3 games  lol. Gotta be kidding me with that shit^"
"Pat gets the attention he does because of the players he's injured. Devin Booker (broken nose), Jeff Green (shoulder contusion), and Russell Westbrook (torn meniscus). He might not be trying to injure people but he's also not trying to avoid injuring them.  He makes high risk plays because at worst for him he gets a flagrant 2 and he's out. He might injure someone but that's the role he's created for himself in the league"
"Ayton's biggest weakness is this  I remember the Nets Suns game in February where the Nets came back from down 24 as being the biggest indicator of this weakness by Ayton. The Nets had no Kyrie or KD (of course Suns played another contender that was unhealthy), just Harden and had to play guys like Tyler Johnson 33 minutes.  Ayton looked absolutely useless out there down the stretch when the Nets put smaller Jeff Green on him in the clutch. Green boxed him out, outrebounded him in the clutch, clamped him in the post, made Ayton follow him on the perimeter and essentially neutralized him. **One time Tyler Johnson switched on to him and Ayton couldn't do anything against him offensively in the post, and cost the Suns the game.**  He's not aggressive enough in beating mismatches, creating his own offense and reaching that next level. He needs to work on that if he wants to reach the next level, because he's not on the level of AD/Embiid/Jokic, or that close to it."
"Monte Morris, Christian Wood, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin (stupid), Reggie Jackson."
I swear some team always lucks into getting Jeff Green for a minimum
Jeff Green was a steal on the minimum this year.  We'll see what he gets in free agency.
"The difference in quality between Durant and the rest of the team was massive. When an injured Harden who cant even run is clearly your 2nd best player, you know you’re in deep shit.  Bruce Brown and Joe Harris are decent role players, but you cant expect them to win you a playoff series. Joe Harris especially, was completely shut down because he’s such a one dimensional player (ala JJ Redick) that he will always struggle to make shots in the playoffs.  And Im pretty sure Jeff Green was injured too."
Did you even watch Love in 2018? Dude averaged 10 points and was hurt during the most crucial game 7 lol he was not better than Jeff Green
Did you even watch Love in 2018? Dude averaged 10 points and was hurt during the most crucial game 7 lol he was not better than Jeff Green
"significantly how? Kyrie missing 3.5 games, Harden missing 4 games and averaging 11PPG on 31/19/89 shooting, Jeff Green missing 3 games"
That man is a walking bucket and it’s still fun to watch from afar. I was cheering for y’all but KD and game 5 Jeff Green were still amazing to watch.
Jeff green could also be on the way he’s been a solid glue guy for many teams
Jeff Green was a big one too
"Serge Ibaka opts out and joins us on the MLE  Sign and trade Dinwiddie for a solid bench piece or a trade exception  Re-sign Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake  Kyrie, KD and Harden go on a vacation together and develop an ability to speak only with their minds"
"First of all KD was the leader of the Nets team this post season, when he led the Sonics to 50 wins in 2010, with Jeff green being his second best player he was also the leader of that team  Also some of y'all seem to think being vocal seems to equal being the leader, it does not."
"&gt;light work of the MVP  You mean the 14th defensive ranked Denver nuggets. KD was averaging 43 with Jeff green and Blake Griffin, kyrie and harden for 3 games each.   Much different to Jokic with nothing but g league players. If the suns had played that nets team, under the circumstances-the bucks did, they loose. We’re seeing what PG by himself is doing, KD would have bounced them. Bucks are winning the chip"
Thats how i feel about jeff green too.  Has been floating thru the league on vet mins for like 4 years now but finds himself as a solid rotation piece on a playoff team every year.   I get why no one wants to give him long term money but im always surprised how long he has to wait to catch a vet min from somewhere each year
The thing is I get what they’re saying. In theory you shouldn’t win based off just that   But if you get a dude as athletic as him and as long as him playing in the age of small ball…then wouldn’t that be the easiest way to win? That wouldn’t work in the 90s for sure but in today’s era where you can have Jeff Green as your big?   What’s holding Giannis back isn’t really his shooting. Shooting makes people respect him for sure but nobody is stopping him when he’s aggressive. He only doesn’t score as much when he’s not running and dunking  So I say what’s holding him back is conditioning. Free throws too for sure but if he gets people in foul trouble then free throws become whatever. He needs to get his conditioning up. Imagine how many opportunities he could open up for his team if he got his conditioning together and got the other team in foul trouble. If the other team is afraid to be aggressive with him because he’s nonstop in the paint then they can’t waste fouls on anyone else  So fuck free throws. Conditioning.
"It’s just that more often than not the bench players are of little consequence and can bring the median age down. All I care about is if a star still carries in his 30s.  I don’t care if other ancillary players bring the age down. Take the 2018 Cavs for example.  All 30+ :   Lebron, JR, Korver, Jeff Green, George Hill ages 31-37   Averaged 150 mpg   Vs   Nance, TT, Clarkson, Hood (25-27) Love (29)  Averaged 99mpg   Now out of rotation guys like zizic and Osman bring the age down. And so does Calderon. But ultimately the bulk of the starters and impact players were 30+  Did they go up against a late 20s superteam that was like nothing we have ever seen before? Yup   He’ll take the 2011 mavs, they were all old and past their prime but somehow beat the heatles in their supposed prime.   Most players aren’t entering their prime till 26 and it doesn’t mean it ends at 29  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8162ee/oc_the_minutesweighted_and_pointsweighted_average/  You look at this graph and most of the teams in the conference finals are on the older side.  And most of the minutes and ppg ofc are too."
"Yeah. You know who else was shooting good all season? Joe Harris. And he also absolutely slayed earlier in the playoffs.   Jeff Green was clearly rusty and injured. And after watching Shamet all season, I think I’d still take an ice cold Joe Harris over whatever random version of Shamet shows up.   Bottom line. Nash did the best he could with the pieces he had."
landry shamet played better in every game of that series outside of game 1 when joe was raining 3's  he played 7 minutes in game 7!  jeff green would have been better too
"could’ve played Jeff Green more. He did nothing that game and was coming off that injury, but he was shooting pretty well all season and won them game 5"
Jeff Green baybay
"&gt; Joe Harris shot almost 50% from 3 in the regular season and all of a sudden it's KD's fault he chokes?  You're the one talking about Joe Harris- don't put words in my mouth just because they're easier for you to argue against.  It's not KD's *fault* that he's not as good as grooming role players for the playoffs as Lebron is, it's just a fact and why Lebron is widely considered the better player.    Joe Harris is just *one* role player of many- Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Mike James, DJ even Blake and Jeff Green at this point.  Why is it that none of them could reach the stratospheric heights of the All-NBA talents named, let me check my notes...Eddie House, Mario Chalmers, Dellavadova, and Varejao?  I hate this dumbass blame game fans like you play.  It's not KD's **fault** that he's not as good at certain aspects of leadership as Lebron, it's just a fact.  I don't hate the guy, I'm just not so far up his anus that I deny reality."
"This is the 2nd reply to specifically single out only this part of my comment, it feels like politics where the politicians pick the smallest snippet of an overall quote and make their entire argument over that without taking the rest of the context.  So on that note, let me take that part out and say for the record that KD was being mostly guarded by Brook Lopez. Do you still agree with the rest of my previous comment that I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin to create their own shot against the rest of the Bucks? Given the situation, dropping 49 and 48 while playing the entire game is still a great game  KD is not a playmaker, so if that's the point you're trying to make, yes I agree with you. He's a pure scorer and a really really good one at that. He did a great job given the entire Nets situation, and I'm thankful for it as a Nets fan. The guy is not a perfect player in all offensive aspects but the effort was clearly there.   Things can be intersectional (for lack of a better word) and things can most definitely be situational without honing in on one specific shortcoming and then gravitating to an extreme based on that (recalling the strawman argument that politicians do). I encourage you as I did with the other reply to look at the majority of the comments and see how appreciative the fans are for Durant despite the cards the Nets were dealt with during the series"
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
I don't see why Jeff Green would leave Brooklyn for LA. He's got great relationships with KD and Harden and was a big piece for them this past year and honestly Brooklyn looks closer to a title than LA right now.
Jeff Green got those shots because the nets big 3 played together like 7 total times last year
Jeff Green and Melo plz
Why would Jeff Green leave Brkn for LA?
"If all the Lakers can offer is the vet min, I'm not sure why Batum or Jeff Green would pick them over teams that could pay them more or the Nets."
Gonna be so mad if Jeff Green jumps ships like that.
"is batum like a let’s not even try going after him he’s going back to the clippers type deal? cause him next to bron and AD would be amazing   jeff green is good if he can shoot, dwight as a backup C is nice, carmelo i’d avoid.. rudy gay would be good, avery as well"
in what world do you think jeff green is getting more shots by playing with the lakers? jeff green averaged 7.9FGA his season in cleveland and 7.8FGA this past season in brooklyn. this past season KCP averaged 7.6FGA and danny green in his season with the lakers averaged 7.0FGA. what makes you think jeff green will be getting more shots than what those guys got?
why would jeff green want to play with the lakers over the nets
Hey Jeff Green was arguably the 2nd best player on the team in the playoffs!
please Jeff Green
"&gt; The Nets' fit isn't supposed to work either.  The Nets fit works because all three of their superstars are useful off-ball players, and they have Joe Harris who is a perfect role player on a team like that. Jeff Green and Landry Shamet combined to hit 40% of almost 600 threes this season.  The Lakers have virtually no shooting, and none of their big 3 are great shooters."
Except you guys also have AD and Russ whereas we had K Love and Jeff Green
"If Harrell gets play as a 6th guy in the playoffs, that’s probably a terrible. More realistically 7th and 8th after they sign Blake Griffin and Jeff Green back"
&gt; 2018 Cavs second best player was Jeff Green  It wasn't supposed to be
Yea people fall in love with memes but jeff green has been a solid role player ever since he was rescued from orlando and the expectations were lifted
this is the first time in my life I’ve ever heard Jeff Green described as consistent
Inconsistent and injured for the biggest games while Jeff Green stepped up and was the only consistent role player in game 7 of the ECF
2018 Cavs second best player was Jeff Green but sure it’s the same as that
Jeff Green
"It was.  The Perk trade was a few weeks after Daniels got shut down.  Boston basically gambled on Shaq's health in order to shore up wing depth.  Even though he was old as dirt, Shaq was still playing some solid basketball and the team was at its best when he was available.  I believe there was also some hope that Jermaine would eventually be able to come back and provide something, so Kendrick was really the third string center.  Plus, IIRC the team was relatively high on Jeff Green and thought this move would be part of the succession plan as the Big Three aged.  Obviously it didn't work out, we resorted to giving Nenad Krstic minutes in the ECSF, and Green missed the entire next season due to his heart condition, but tbh I don't think the series outcome would have changed with Perk.  He really wasn't that good anymore.  The lambasting that trade gets is pretty unfair, imo."
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"For me it was Perk for Jeff Green. We got absolutely killed on the glass after that and Green came in at a position that was already strong for us, SF/PF"
His agent is literally the worst agent ever smh. Every team wants a Jeff green. I don’t understand why he hasn’t been able to sign a deal over the min
Somehow all the other journeymen players named Green can at least get like a 3 year 10-12 million contract but then uncle Jeff ends up getting signed last minute one year deals. I seriously question the competency of his agent.
"This is a very reasonable take. They can get guys like Ellington/D Green/Jeff Green for cheap, retain Caruso and THT, look at a mid level guy like McDermott or Bullock, and get a couple pieces from a S&amp;T with Schroder. Just like that, they're exceptionally difficult to beat."
Wasn't Jeff Green with them?
is Jeff Green a FA?
If the Nets are getting Kuz + Harrell for Dinwiddie why not flip them for Hield? Kuz is redundant with Jeff Green and Buddy would be a perfect 6th man/Joe Harris replacement if he struggles in the playoffs again
I’d love him as our jeff green from this year man
Jeff Green would be an awesome signing for you
*Jeff green has decided where he wants to go next*
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
Well neither of Harrell or Kuzma provides defense and if Harris goes cold again in the playoffs they need shooting.  Buddy is the perfect sixth man for them.  Also if they get Jeff Green back Kuzma is redundant
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
Forbes is definitely looking for more money than a minimum or he would have stayed with the champion bucks.   Batum could join the lakers.   JJ has made it pretty clear he wants to go to Brooklyn and Jeff Green is either looking for more money or he'll just stay on the Nets where he already knows the system and is more likely to win.
"Brynn Forbes, Batum, Jeff Green, JJ Reddick, etc."
"I dunno just thinking how I’d throw out the matchups. You still have KD on help side, Jeff Green can body up Lebron and take a shot at AD too.   If this year showed us anything it’s that the only games the lakers can win are grind out games at less than 105 points. So just like you thinking the lakers big 3 can’t be guarded the nets big 3 are just as unguardable plus they have Harris, Griffin, and Green as solid rotation pieces already"
"How were they ass? Westbrook shot 20% from three. Dude fucking sucks. Our team numbers don’t look great because eric gordon was launching 7 a game at a bad clip. Our team wasn’t “trash”, we had 2 high level 3 and D switchable defenders in tucker and covington, literally the best offensive player in the league demanding double teams OFF WESTBROOK every play, Jeff green who was playing really well, Eric Gordon, austin rivers, keep arguing that our team was somehow trash and Westbrook is absolved of all blame as if we weren’t up 1-0 on you with the lead in game 2 until Westbrook checked into the game and literally threw it away.  Your fan base was celebrating when he checked in. I was in the game thread. The same guy you just traded for, your fan base *celebrated him checking in for the other team* while on the verge of going down 2-0. That's fucking hilarious"
"Durant on Lebron, or one of their wings like Blake or Jeff green if they are still there. Whatever big on the floor on AD. Russ can be guarded by either harden or kyrie as long as they pack the paint  You can ask the question the other way round too. Just too much firepower and shooting"
Don't forget Jeff Green
At worst?    Jeff Green has been a very productive NBA player.
At worst he'll be a good Jeff Green replacement.
"The Nets still have a rotation even without Jeff Green and Blake Griffin. The Lakers have to fill out their entire roster with vet mins. And at this point, why ring chase with the Lakers over the Nets? Big 3 &gt; Big 2.5"
"Welcome home, Jeff Green!"
If the Nets are getting Kuzma + Trez for Dinwiddie why not flip that to the Kings for Hield since that was what the Lakers/Kings had apparently agreed on? Hield gives them some great wing depth and if they get Jeff Green back Kuzma becomes somewhat redundant
Wouldn’t Brooklyn want to hang on to Jeff Green? He was solid for them
"I wonder if the Nets would be interested in flipping Kuz + Harrell for Hield since apparently that's what they're getting for Dinwiddie  If they get Jeff Green back on the taxpayer MLE they don't really need Kuz and Hield gives them some shooting, youth and competition for Joe Harris"
"As a long time Thunder fan, if Russell Westbrook and Jeff Green end up on the Lakers and they play KD and Harden in the Finals, I'll be at a loss for words."
"We're just talking shooting and nothing else? There's a busload of guys available on the market who are good shooters who probably wouldn't be super expensive.  Carmelo, Ellington, Lou Will, Ennis, Jeff Green, maybe Redick would be willing to make a near-min deal, maybe Korver, E'Twaun Moore, Patty Mills, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Kent Bazemore, Korkmaz, Otto Porter, Temple, Terence Davis, and on and on.  Obviously these are all role players and certainly not the elite of the elite, but they're all guys who can give shooting/spacing on cheap deals."
Lakers would looks to try to bring back   Ben McLemore   Markieff Morris   Wesley Matthews   And maybe try to poach Jeff green from the nets   Theres chatter about Melo going to LA too
"They are gonna be one hell of a good rebounding team with Bron, Westbrook, Davis, any decent center. A lot of bricks but a lot more shot opportunities. Get some guys on vet min like Jeff Green, George Hill etc"
"Good shooting vets are available:Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington, Jeff Green, Doug McDermott, Patty Mills, etc. I’m not sure it would be hard to convince them to come to LA and play with 3 All-NBA players. Especially when 2 of them have averaged 10+ assists"
Same people who had inflated expectations for Wesley Matthews last yr. And nobody guards Jeff Green regardless of what % he shot last yr he's no floor spacer either.
Jeff green MLE
i think teams would happily help off jeff green to cover lebron and russ on drives. he’s shot the ball well the last few years but he’s not like an amazing floor spacer
"Jeff Green isn't getting a vet min this year.  Otherwise, he just stays in BKN."
Jeff Green will win you a playoff game. He was the most consistent player outside of LeBron in their 2018 run.
Jeff green would
I could see the Nets wanting Kuzma if Jeff Green leaves. They'd definitely rather have Green though.
"I mean theres no way of knowing yet, but there are plenty of guys out there who might fight the bill -   Jeff Green, Melo, Forbes maybe, Rivers, Ellington, Temple, Ennis, Redick maybe, E'Twaun Moore, Korver maybe if he decides to return, probably several others I might be forgetting."
The one on Jordan Crawford and Jeff Green is disgusting. Also you gotta love Tim Hardaway Jr just laughing after his grab wasn't enough lol.
"Seth curry with 36, Terrance Mann with 39, Jeff Green with 27 on 7/8 from 3 were some I forgot about damn. Ja with 47 too"
Jeff Green vibes.
"Yeah I didn’t see the “based on what they will get paid” Now it makes sense that Jeff green is in that tier, but I’d be very surprised if it pertained to Bobby and like u/30another mentioned, Kelly Olynk"
"How are players like Jeff Green, Bobby Portis, Nic Batum, and Bruce Brown 5th tier? All these guys are pretty good role players"
Tatum being called light-skinned Rudy Gay and Brown being called flat top Jeff Green.
"Nobody gives a fuck about donte, he’s nothing compared to harden kyrie and Jeff green"
"I was rooting for the bucks. I know giannis has a beef with harden, but harden also dumped us and went out of shape so that we would get no assets for his trade, saying in his last press conference that we didn’t have enough skill, chemistry, or talent. I was rooting for cp3, but that team just has so many floppers it was hard to root for. I’m so happy for pj tucker. Losing him and Robert Covington, and Jeff green hurt me the most :("
Jeff Green would have been a star player if he never had to get heart surgery
"I just don’t get the average defense. I hear Suns fans say it a lot but I can’t see how he’s around the 50th percentile by my eye test or the stats.  For the regular season, epm put him in the 28th percentile of the league with -1.1 making him 360th of 511 in the league. Other 28th percentile guys included Vernon Carey Jr., Jeff Green, Sato. and Okoro. He was 511th in defensive Lebron out of 539 with a -1.58 this past regular season. He didn’t play enough to qualify for their overall playoffs metric (combined multiple postseasons for a better sample size).  His best ever defensive bpm was -1.1 this years playoffs and his best for the regular season was -1.3 in 19-20. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify, he was 77th tied with Rondo His -1.5 in the regular season put him 155th at worst 159th (bballref sorts by the rounded numbers not the ones that go past the hundredth place) tied with CJ, Fox, Joe Harris, and Shamet.  His best stat is d-Raptor which is -0.5 for the full season (regular and playoffs since they recommend at least 1000 minutes for stable results) putting him at 153rd of 250 players. He did very very well in the playoffs with a plus 2 putting him at 27th of 100 qualifying players. That really brought his numbers up because he was at -1.5 for the regular season tied with Garland and Hield for 195th out of 249th."
Jeff Green went so far in the other direction that I actually think he's underrated as a role player now.
The new Jeff Green
Jeff Green Otto Porter …that it at this point? Woof
"Brooklyn's biggest weakness is their lack of size, which is why they leaned heavily into their biggest strength in the playoffs, which was spreading the floor with shooters and letting their big dogs cook. Milwaukee was able to beat them because of their huge size advantage... and injuries.... Anyways, their size and versatility paid dividends against a small Brooklyn team. None of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or KD shouldn't be playing center in the playoffs against either Brook Lopez or Giannis.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know the exact FA pool, but I'm sure a decent center would be willing to take the MLE from Brooklyn in order to compete.  &amp;#x200B;  And yeah I agree Joe Harris sucked in game 7 especially, but he's still a great shooter, and I think he'll step it up next year. If not, the talent of KD Harden and Kyrie is still more than capable of winning it for them."
"&gt; Clown take? Your take is LeBron put up bigger stats with Jeff Green as his second man.  Yes, that is my take.  &gt;So do you think if LeBron had 4 KDs on his team he would have scored even more? Of course not cause then he would have to share the ball more.  I think he would have won the series more easily, which according to you is apparently “showing up”  &gt;You clearly don't know about basketball. Like I said your attempt to make excuses for LeBron shows you don't truly believe he came through but you want others to believe that he did.  Yeah you’re dense as fuck. Dude dropped 50/8/8 against a superteam with zero help and you’re legitimately trying to argue that he didn’t show up. Hilarious."

Jesus are you dense or something? He dropped 46/11/9 and 35/15/9 in those two games despite having  Jeff Green as his second best player.  &gt;You're basically admitting LeBron didn't come through you are just blaming his team.   Absolute clown take.
Dude... Hardens made guys like Capela and Jeff Green look like all Stars while your boy Luka makes all stars look like bums. The second Porzingis gets away from Luka yall gonna see him back and that's a knock on Luka
"yeah i mean look at the 2018 roster, its insane. they have jeff green out there playing major minutes. this is not a finals team by any standard he took them on his back"
So you specifically  implied that LeBron came through but then hit with facts your are saying that his second guy for 2 games of the playoffs was Jeff Green.  You're basically  admitting LeBron didn't come through you are just blaming his team. Either you come through or you don't.
Jeff Green is the king of the Minimum Contract
"Because khris middleton and jrue holiday were trash for half the series. No one on the bucks was really helping Giannis consistently, KD had games where blake griffin, Jeff Green, bruce brown stepped up on top of having 2 games of healthy kyrie. Khris and jrue were hit or miss all playoffs."
Answer my question.  &gt;The raptors series was a good series for the cavs but then they played a C's team missing their best 2 players at the time and it still foes 7 games and then they get laminated in the finals.   You forgot to mention that his second best player in Game 6 and 7 of the ECF was Jeff Green.   Jeff Green.
Jeff Green can't go off against the Bucks if he's on the Bucks *taps head*
Kuminga is all about projection and development. You have to consider the possible outcomes for him and believe that he can get to that Jaylen Brown level eventually or at least become a better Jeff Green type player. If they have no faith in that then it’s gonna be a hard sell.
"It's funny how often he moves around, how affordable he is, and yet there's always at least a couple playoff series that would have had a different winner if you add Jeff Green to the losing team."
29 teams in NBA : I will trade you mason plumlee and Jeff green for Dame.   29 teams: yes that’s fine  Lakers: I will trade you all of our picks and 6 players for Cj McCollum   29 other teams: hmm idk I don’t think that’s enough might need more here
Jeff Green should be more of a priority than Blake Griffin for the Nets right?
Jeff green should stay with the nets.. his chances of getting his ring is better with the nets. He goes to the bucks and the nets end his chances
Jeff Green is the ultimate example of a role player who just turns it on with Harden spoonfeeding him.  Green obviously had a few great games vs the Bucks w James not doing much but his Rockets stint last year and the regular season proved he fits Harden like a glove.
Bro Jeff Green next to Giannis would be amazing. Prefer Bobby obviously but what an alternative
Jeff Green is an NBA anomaly.  I hope he plays till he's 40.
"Jeff ""Different Team, Every Season"" Green"
This was a hilariously painful season. We had:  - Record setting injured basketball team that still made playoffs. I was even surprised we made 7th.   - Matt Barnes Half Court Buzzer Beater against Pistons (at Detroit)  - Tony Allen mopping the floor against LeBron and Kyrie at Rocket Mortgage. We also only went to Cleveland with 8 men that game and left with the W.  - Jeff Green alley oop buzzer beater dunk against Suns  - Mario Chalmers crazy stumbling and-1 against the Pistons to ice the game at the Grindhouse.  - ZBo's first ever triple double and it was against the Clippers   - Lee's buzzer beater at half time against Rockets. It was impressive because he didn't have much time to set himself up.  - Vince Carter full court buzzer beater  - Lance Born Ready Stephenson  - JayMachal Green showed his game   - Birdman  Joerger is one hell of a coach. He adjusted really well.
"He got one win, mostly thanks to Jeff Green tbh"
I really like that team.  I wish they would have kept Jeff Green and just kept the entire team youthful.
"Joe Harris, the best 3 point shooter in the nba by %.  Blake Griffin &amp; Deandre Jordan, former all-nba players.  Jeff Green &amp; Landry Shamet, starters for other contenders. Bench players for the Nets."
"Of course. They LOOKED unstoppable. Turns out they stopped themselves. It's not just Kyrie and Harden: Harris sucked, coached stopped playing Jeff Green after he came back even though he was playing well. They made mistakes too.   What if KD had played more than 35 games, or Harden/Kyrie didn't miss time in the regular season? They probably take over the one seed from Philly and things play out entirely differently.   Luka was amazing but his team didn't advance. Does that mean the Mavs actually won the title? What if Anthony Davis was healthy all regular season? The Lakers obviously have a higher seed and the entire West shakes out differently. It certainly doesn't mean that he couldn't have cooled off or that he wouldn't get hurt in a later round.   You've got to play the games. There's one champion and it's because they outlasted everything else that they and others were dealing with. Roster construction is a big part of that.  The best team in the East is by definition the ECF champ. Same with the West. To look at box scores and historical performances doesn't mean anything. What ifs are just coping scenarios and they always fail to account for any of the negative outcomes that could have happened if bandwagon players/teams had been better."
"Yeah, it's damn close and honestly I think they're two of the three best playoff performances in recent years (LeBron's game 1 against the Warriors in the JR Smith game being the last one to round that trio out), but I think I lean KD's performance in game 5 as well. You can definitely make an argument for either, but the fact that KD did what he did with Jeff Green as his number two just *slightly* puts it over the top of what Giannis did in game 6."
"5.6 AST w/ 3.4 TO per game is not really a great ratio for a lead offensive player... His scoring was amazing, but so was the scoring of plenty other guys...  1.Steph: 32 ppg on 65%TS 2.Jokic: 26.5 ppg on 65%TS 3.Giannis 28 ppg om 63%TS  Steph and Joker much better playmakers than Durant. Giannis similar-ish playmaker, but better defender...  Then we have Bron who put up 27.5 ppg on 65%TS in the 2020 Playoffs. When he's healthy he can be close enough as a scorer to Durant but clearly superior in other areas...  Harden ditto. He's just in a different role now. His Playoff struggles qre overblown. Dude carried biggest offensive load in the league in Houston and got eliminated by much better teams, mostly Golden State dynasty... Durant has been hiding on elite offensive teams his whole career almost...  Bucks series first time since like 2013/14 that KD had mediocre offensive support, and still Blake, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, Shamet were hitting their shots. Kyrie played  half the series too...  Durant was 35 ppg 59%TS... He volume scored like a mf. Playmaking was mediocre, defense was actually better than expected, i will give him that.  Overall great series, but nothing we haven't seen from all the top 10 guys in recent years... Giannis had a better series in the Finals..."
Plot twist: They get Celtics Jeff Green.
Why is Jeff green so undervalued
I hope they are getting Brooklyn Jeff Green and not Utah Jeff Green
The Celtics were missing 3 starters by the end of that series while the Nets were completely healthy aside from Jeff Green.
"Pretty sure towards the end of the season, Houston started having Russ initiate the offense after they traded for Jeff Green and went 5 out. It was when Westbrook looked at his best as well before getting COVID and the quad injury."
When I became a parent it made me the Jeff Green of sleep... I \*deserve\* more than the absolute minimum amount of sleep but no matter what I do I keep getting the minimum... Only after years and years of sleep-deprivation will I get a few years above average and then it will be time for me to retire.
"""Congrats! Who's the lucky guy""  ""Jeff Green""  ""I'll help you move"""
"Jeff Green? Keep moving, never gets comfy in one place?"
He is like the Jeff Green of centers
Kyrie was already out by that season. Their second best player in the ECF was Jeff Green. Rockets absolutely wipe the floor with that garbage team and completely take advantage of their abysmal excuse of a defensive system.
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Seeing the league now really puts shit into perspective. The thunder were young and inexperienced and the lakers put them away handily, showing championship experience is crucial. Back in 2010 i think  Just imagine somehow someway the thunder were able to keep russ, kd, and harden?  Plus jeff green and ibaka were no scrubs either"
Loved Jeff Green to the Nuggets.
Jeff Green is a center now so I'll give him a shout out
"Too bad they got rid of Jeff Green! I feel like a team with Green, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka could be really good! You might even have the ability to trade Green for a guy like Perkins."
"It was part of the trade. Remember Danny Green was shooting below expectation, Lakers wanted to get rid of his 2nd year 15M contract. Getting rid of DG with a 2nd round pick, and received a 6MOY PG condidate was seen as a great move at the time  Same reason we had to start Drummond. He was ""promised"" playtime, so he chose LA over Celtics.  ""Schroder said that he has not spoken to Lakers coach Frank Vogel about his desire to start, however his representatives, Alex Saratsis and Jeff Austin of Octagon, discussed that aspect with the Lakers front office prior to L.A.'s trading guard Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in the draft to the Thunder to complete the deal."""
"If I'm not mistaken, the Nuggets used part of the MLE to sign Jeff Green, so they don't have the full $9.5M, more like $4.5M at max. So they'd have an even worse offer for Dennis"
"We're definitely seeing more of a transition to small-ball in the playoffs if it means that teams don't have to put a player on the court that'll get exploited. Jeff Green, Marcus Morris, Dario Saric and Bobby Portis all come to mind. I would not consider any of them to be a traditional 5.  But as I mentioned, even the small-ball guys got paid."
I’d argue that there’s simply a gap between elite centers and average at this state of the nba. Also other positions are being moved around. Small forwards nowadays sometimes play center. Jeff green was a small forward in his early days but now plays center as well.
Hopefully he's more of a Joe Johnpn for us instead of a Jeff Green or Ed Davis.
"Hell no lmao  Kuminga is an uber athletic small forward with slashing and some post up scoring skill, way higher offensive upside. His comps are Jaylen Brown, Jeff Green  You’re prob thinking of Usman Garuba, the only guy who gets  the Draymond comp in the draft"
"Except under snyder, they’ve consistently signed vets who you’d probably expect to sign with a big market like the LAs or BKs. Joe Johnson, jeff green, now whiteside and gay."
"YES finally   &gt;As sort of an amalgam of the last two points, I’m basically done with fake stretch bigs as topline players. By fake, I mean they aren’t really bigs. They might be tall. But if they can’t do big-man things like protect that rim and/or put smaller players in the basket with the ball if they are being guarded by some random small forward, then they are just slow, often mediocre shooting threes rather than bigs. This sort of walking one-way mismatch doesn’t cut it in modern playoffs.  There is some recency bias with this, like sorry Im not taking Jeff Green over someone like Royce O'Neale if my goal is to win the most basketball games possible next year. Devonte Graham also shouldnt have come this close to missing out is the other thing that came ot my mind."
"Especially since we already have zeke and Jeff green, he’s not gonna get any playing time"
"I mean they're definitely going to suck if they're going to be heavily featuring their young guys, teams led by rookies and sophomores always do horrible. Even in KD's 2nd year when the Thunder had KD, Westbrook, Jeff Green leading they only won 23 games. It'll depend on how much they want to play their veterans, but I have a feeling Wall or Gordon are getting dumped and they let the young guns run the show."
"I did not like what I saw from Mobley. Extremely passive, especially in the first half. He came alive some in the 2nd half only to have a couple real bad possessions at the end there. He seems to have a lot of “Jeff Green mentality” in him."
Put Jeff Green at C.
How would the All Green Lineup do?  Jalen Green  Gerald Green  Danny Green  Jeff Green  Draymond Green
"actually the original three was jeff green, westbrook, durant, no?  OKC drafts so much talent, people forget they drafted jeff green too lol"
Then number 3 this year. Lol. That's seven top 5 picks since 2011.  I wonder what magic Presti could have worked with those? All joking aside... as an OKC fan we were quite spoiled to see our only picks that landed top 5 become MVPs (plus trading for Jeff Green).  I want to see if Presti was just lucky or really skilled. Giddey at 6 this year was the closest we've been to a top 5 pick since Steven Adams was the 12th selection in 2013. I want to see Presti have more cracks at the top 5 to see what happens.
&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if there was some journey man in the nba who was on like eight of the same teams that ariza was on.  The name's Green. Jeff Green.
Pretty sure Jeff Green is one of them
I’m saying lebrons finals performances make him look like dorozen   Cmon man. Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals while being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec    Jordan honestly wouldn’t make the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 cavs teams lebron took to the finals   I’m talking about in the modern era not the expansion era where Jordan made the playoffs going 30-52
"Nuggets signed Jeff Green who was better, not a lot of minutes for Millsap there"
Definitely. The Aaron Gordon trade was a great move by the front office. Also having Jeff Green as a backup I'd nice because that guy can still play
"Jeff Green, Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen, idk why these 3&amp;D wings just don't do well in the Jazz."
Who would get bumped out of the top 10? Maybe Jeff Green or Ronda Hollis-Jefferson.
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jamychal Green, Javonte Green, Jalen Green… who else?"
Also Jeff and JaMychal Green reunited on the Nuggets. They were teammates on the Grizzlies.
I understand your view. It was a very different Net's offense though and one that was vastly less efficient. One that needed any slight boost outside of random Jeff Green 3's and Bruce Brown short rolls. Good discussion though I enjoyed.
Re nuggets. Jeff green replaces Millsap
I think they preferred patty over green. Seems like they got similar deals and we could only have one. Might be a bet that Jeff is gonna be 35 and he will fal off a cliff aoon
Losing Jeff Green is huge. But he was injured in the playoff. Maybe they felt they don’t need him.
"Blake, Brown, Mills.  They're having a great off-season if you ask me. Only better thing would be to keep Jeff Green."
"Missing two? All stars? Kyrie played in 4 games, James harden played in 3 games, miss me with that one leg bs, he was in the court and played 40+ minutes not trying to hear any bs excuses. Blake Griffin was great at home and Jeff green shot 8/9 from 3 in game 5. The nets were good bucks were just better, sorry, I meant Giannis was just better. Plus I don’t give two fucks if you’re impressed or not, you’re a no body"
They averaged similar numbers for the series except y'all love the 'KD went to game 7 by himself' narrative even tho he won one game without Kyrie when Jeff Green scored 27. Then when it mattered most in game 7 OT KD went scoreless and Giannis dropped the game tying bucket over him
"And Jeff green shooting 7-8 from 3!  People don’t actually watch the games.  They look at box scores and follow narratives; if you watched you would know that the bucks were up in game 4 when Kyrie went down. The series was 2-1 with the home team winning each game.  After this game, the beets only won one more game and that was kd’z best game he has ever played.  Couple that with green scoring 27 on like 85% true shooting or something stupid like that, the nets barely won game 5. The nets probably win the series of fully healthy, but it was not a fore gone conclusion"
"Or if Jrue Holiday could hit an open three, or if Middleton didn’t alternate between prime MJ and a G Leaguer, or if Jeff Green only had a good shooting night in game 5 instead of by far the best of his career…  Ifs and buts are all fine but Giannis just capped off an all-timer of a playoff run with a GOAT-tier finals series, it doesn’t matter how he’s perceived. I’m sure he’d be getting shit on if we lost, in fact I’m certain because he *was* getting shit on while that series was ongoing, but the people shitting on him would be wrong because he was fantastic and he didn’t lose anyway. We’ve seen what he can do, and it’s something very few other players in history have been capable of."
"2018 Cavs? LeBron, K Love, IT, D Rose, D Wade and roleplayers like prime Jeff Green, JR Smith, Shumpert, Crowder, Calderon, Perkins, Tristian Thompson, Korver and George Hill  Granted this is kinda cheating as they traded like half the team halfway through the seasons but only Crowder and George Hill would be removed if you didn't count it."
Jeff Green joins the chat
Does Giannis get Kyrie to start the series as well and go up 2-0? Cuz Khris and Jrue were very bad to start the series. I can make an argument that Blake Griffin outperformed Jrue on the offensive end. Even the one game KD was able to win 'by himself' Jeff Green dropped 27 points and went 7-8 from 3 which is all star level production.
Sorry. Didn’t mean to disrespect nba legends Jeff Green and Shamet
The next Jeff Green
"in 2017, Cleveland had: Larry Sanders, Andrew Bogut, Deron Williams, Derrick Williams, James Jones and Richard Jefferson for a little over $5M  In 2018 they had: Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Larry Nance, Jeff Green, Marcus Thornton and Jose Calderon for like $9M"
"It's a redistribution method. The money is collected from the high payroll teams and sent to the non-tax payers.   There are competitive implications:   It's a way of increasing costs for relatively wealthier/more talented teams, acting as a hard cap that can slice players' salaries, in theory. (It's debatable whether slicing salaries is true.)   It's also likely that the tax sends talented role players, such as a Jeff Green or Caruso, away to other teams, diminishing the top team's overall chance a modest amount. Additionally, it does the same in acquiring these types for the same reasons:  they're not going to be worth their salary plus the tax. So tax payers seek out cheaper, lesser options.   It's conceivable that the harden trade to Houston was due in large part to the tax implications. So, it may be that allstars and superstars are also subject to its ramifications.    It's not part of BRI, since the money has already been accounted for. Players already have been allotted their cash. With the income, teams pay expenses, put it in savings, or sent it out as dividends to their investors."
"Didn't they just signed Jeff Green? On top of Jamychal Green and Aaron Gordon, I feel like they just running small."
Jeff Green is Allen Covert
"Your Celtics squad after the KG/Ray trade and before the trade for Jeff Green had some great times too. I didn't root for them of course, yet couldn't help but follow the off court moments"
Kuzma the stretch 4 who can't shoot or defend? Best case is Jeff green if he improved his shot.
"Reggie ""Jeff Green"" Jackson"
"Wade was stuck getting bounced in the 1st round or missing the playoffs every year after Shaq fell off and got traded to Phoenix while Chris Bosh couldn’t make the playoffs at all in Toronto, let alone win in the playoffs.   Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love couldn’t crack 35 wins on their respective teams before LeBron, let alone make the playoffs, let alone win in the playoffs.  Anthony Davis couldn’t make the playoffs in New Orleans, let alone win in the playoffs.  LeBron turned every one of them into champions within the 1st 2 seasons lmao. Chris Bosh missed the entire 2012 2nd round series against Indiana, missed 4 of the 7 games against Boston in the ECF, and was limited to 12 and 7 in only 25 mpg in the 3 games he did play in that series after returning from injury. They still won the East and ultimately the championship because LeBron was the best player in the league by far.  In 2013 Wade was having obvious knee issues through the whole playoff run. He averaged less than 14 points on below 37% shooting in round 1 vs Milwaukee, averaged less than 13 points in round 2 against the Bulls, and averaged less than 16 ppg on below 44% shooting in the ECF vs. Indy. Bosh averaged 11 points and 4 rebounds on less than 38% shooting in that same ECF vs Indy. They still won the East and ultimately the championship against one of the best teams of all time in the Spurs because LeBron was the best player in the league by far. They won the finals against the Spurs in the minutes that Wade was on the bench in favor of Ray Allen.   But yes, LeBron was one “cockriding” them and not the other way around. Can’t make this shit up lol. I didn’t even get into the part where Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder in round 1 of the 2015 playoffs and they still rampaged to the finals without him only for Kyrie to get hurt in game 1 of the finals so LeBron could push one of the greatest teams of all time in Golden State to 6 games with a starting 5 of Delly/Shump/Bron/TT/Mosgov because he was the best player in the league by far.   Also didn’t yet mention the 2016 playoffs when Love averaged 8 points on 35% shooting against the 73 win Warriors who were an awful matchup for him but the Cavs still came back down 3-1 with LeBron putting in arguably the greatest finals performance of all time because he was the best player in the league by far.  While we’re at it let’s fast forward to 2018 after Kyrie was PMSing and forced a trade in which the Cavs got back a pile of garbage and still went on to win the East and make the finals with Jeff Green being their 2nd best player in the playoffs ahead of “superstar” Kevin Love. That same team went on to win 19 fucking games the next season when Bron went to LAL.  Sounds like Bron was really cockriding them hard though lmao.   Meanwhile when MJ retired to play baseball the Bulls still won 55 games, pushed the Knicks 7 games in the 2nd round, and got screwed out an ECF appearance at least by the referees. Anchored by arguably the best coach of all time, MJ had a supporting cast that was still a contender without him. When Lebron left Cleveland for Miami, they won 19 fucking games after winning 61 with the same team the year before plus LeBron. But MJ is WARRIOR for being drafted to an organization that put him in an incredible situation  unlike the COWARD LeBron who only carried Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams to the finals once before leaving after wasting 7 years. Lmaoooo.  Kobe got drafted to play in LA with one of the 3 most dominant players in the modern era while also getting to play for one of the best coaches of all time. Kobe averaged 15 points on 35% shooting in the finals against Indiana and they still won easily because Shaq averaged literally close to 40 points on  almost 60% shooting lmao. THAT is cockriding like a playboy bunny. But once again, What an absolute GAMER  for not leaving the absolutely perfect situation that was brought to him unlike the FRAUD LeBron James who went running from Drew Gooden and Larry Hughes after 7 years. Also Kobe totally didn’t publicly request a trade after they had a couple bad years after Shaq left before they got Pau Gasol and reloaded. That definitely didn’t happen and Kobe would’ve stuck it out for way more than 7 years in Cleveland with Boobie Gibson and Jamario Moon because he was a true junkyard DOG unlike LEBUM.  The LeBron hating cult has gone way past the point of insufferable. Y’all have been bitching about a dude leaving the most incompetent franchise in sports (while Boston was in the conference coming off a finals appearance with 4 stars on one team, mind you) for literally over a decade now. Get over it."
"Yes or he’d trade for washed up d-rose, washed up Wade, and Jeff green."
Yeah that was definitely the vibe I got from their series this past year. Durant really needed all the help he got from mike James shamet joe Harris ans Jeff green.
Lost Jeff Green and the asset of Dinwiddie for mills and some garbage seconds. Nets got worse
"Jeff Green had an aortic aneurysm if I recall, which is a thinning of the lining of the major vessel out of the heart causing an outpouch at risk of ruoturing. That would for sure need surgery to go in and correct. WPW is more electrical, and have found some medicines can control just fine without surgery. Modern medicine is amazing, but the heart is a wild organ."
Didn't Jeff Green have to have open heart surgery to fix his?
"So if a guy can actually get his jumpshot off in .3 seconds it wouldn’t count because it’s not a tip in? I recall Jeff green hitting a buzzer beater three against the heat with like .4 seconds, would they just have waved it off even if he got it off in time?"
Yeah and Jeff Green has been pretty quality since 08
I always felt bad for Jeff Green when he wasn't mentioned in that one KD commercial with Westbrook and Ibaka.
"Denver did very well. Kept Barton, Jamychal Green and Rivers on good contracts and added Jeff Green for cheap.   The Bulls did well but I honestly think this sets this up to be just *kinda good* for the next couple years adding a good but expensive and odd-fitting Derozan with Lavine. They've been *kinda bad* for a little while so I think they made solid moves, I'm just expressing why I don't think it's a home run."
Jeff Green always gives u a random 20 point game in the offs I’d go with him
Jeff Green
Ariza has had a better career and probably better at his peak. Dude's defense was insane on those switch-everything rockets.      Right now it's Jeff Green without much debate
Jeff green obviously
"You should have gotten him. Mavs now have both Sterling and Moses Brown, while Nuggets have both JMyke and Jeff Green. Confusing last names are all the rage in the Western Conference this year!"
"Knicks fan here. I still consider our rival to be the Heat but I'm also an old person who still thinks it's 1999.   Jealous of the Heat for their consistent success. As a Ravens fan, I hate to say it but I consider them to be the closest analogue to the Ravens in the NBA. A relatively young franchise that has found a way to be consistently competitive and built a culture that both fanbases annoyingly hype up  I guess if in 2021, our rival is considered the Nets then I'm jealous of them for... I dunno... Jeff Green is pretty cool I guess? Landry Shamet looks like Waluigi so that's interesting and whatnot"
"They got JR in a trade? I dont even think Miller played for the Cavs or he was washed and they didnt play him. Even Korver was a trade. This IS about big markets and desirable places and LBJ. He got Rashard Lewis, Battier, Ray Allen to come to Miami, Gasol, Dwight, Melo, Monk, Morris, McGee, Bradley for LAL... and basically Jeff Green for the Cavs"
I don't get it how do they lose Jeff Green if he didn't sign with anyone else yet is he retiring?
"can go smaller and use Prince George County, Maryland; population 900k  KD, Oladipo, Markelle Fultz, Michael Beasley, Ty Lawson, Jeff Green, Quinn Cook, Jerami Grant, Roy Hibbert, Thomas Robinson, Jarrett Jack.  They could probably give Slovenia a run"
They are running it back with basically the same roster and got a solid role player with the Jeff Green signing they're depth is fine. Also they had a great record with Murray out.  I think MPJ is a sneaky all-star pick this season and should be a strong contender for MIP
"Got Austin back on a min, sniped Jeff Green for 5/yr, kept Jamychal on good value. Idk what you're smoking man"
Didn't they get Jeff Green off of Brooklyn as well?
Lmao you lost this argument so badly. None of your points are actually valid and you’re not countering any of mine with anything. It’s just MUH BOGUT AND DONTE lol like bro nobody cares. You don’t see anyone mention danny green not playing for the sixers losing to the hawks or deandre Hunter not playing for the hawks or Jeff green getting hurt for the nets or dario getting hurt for the suns because NOBODY CARES  harden and kyrie didn’t play and the bucks lucked out. nothing you say will convince anyone otherwise
"I think people sleep on the 2011 Celtics.   Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal  Nate Robinson, Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Jermaine O'Neal, Kendrick Perkins  Delonte West, Marquis Daniels and Glen ""Big Baby"" Davis for the meme bench players.  But for real, that starting 5 and top 10 players are pretty nutty. All time Jermaine O'Neal as an after thought is pretty crazy. Best all time team ever? Probably not. But it's certainly slept on"
"Because a nice stretch doesn't outweigh an entire career of a dude.  Remember that all of Jeff green, nick young, and Jr Smith had runs of ""hey he's actually pretty effective now!"". Doesn't mean those guys were all incredible.  Everyone's a pro in this league."
"13 was prime for Bron, Melo and Russ. AD was just starting and Dwight lost some of his prime, but still elite players.   Compare that to Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Blake and Jeff Green who were destroying everyone with G-league level bench (and Harris/Brown) - you legit think that '13 team is not better?   &gt;I watched all of that shit.   And in the next sentence you say that Melo couldn't do much at that point, so that's obviously bullshit lmao"
"I'm sure Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Kyle Korver, Jeff Green all went to the Cavs because they admired Koby Altman so much"
Durant Blake Bruce Jeff green and joe put up a betrer fight than the Lakers did against the suns when they didn’t have AD

jeff green at 11 now
"Jeff Green and Ish Smith could have a entire ""Who he play for?"" segment between the two."
"50% harden was better than our other options how does that change anything? And if you're gonna say ""if Jeff green didn't go 7/8"" how about we say ""if Joe Harris didn't brick wide open shots end of game 3 and game 7"""
lol people act like Kyrie didn’t play 3 and a half games where they were already up 2-1. We were ahead when Kyrie went down. It’s funny when they said Harden was coming back everyone knew he wouldn’t be 100% but that wouldn’t matter because “even a 50% Harden would be better than none”. After Kyrie went down we won 3 of the next 4 but people act like it was KD by himself that took the series to 7 games. If Jeff green hadn’t gone 7/8 from 3 game 5 the series would’ve been over in 6.
"And no Aldridge, plus Jeff Green missed the first few games of the Bucks series."
Do the Nets really not have more? I guess one was Jeff Green
"We were up in the third quarter of that game, but people conveniently leave that out.  The nets might have won, but that shit wasn’t a certainty.  Harden has been undoubtedly inconsistent his entire playoff career, but he would have been lebron James this season if he was healthy because??? Durant doesn’t score nearly as much if those other two are around and they do not play the same defense, which is the reason it went 7, if Kyrie and harden are on the court.  Also, remember Jeff green going 7 for 8 from 3 and scoring 28 points in game 5.  You aren’t getting they same performance from him if those two are playing.  No question one of them may approximate what he did, but the man was over 80% true shooting that game.  They don’t get that, they lose in 6!"
Jeff Green was terrible on defense
"bucks had donte divincenzo out  nets had kyrie for a couple games and then One-Leg Harden for another couple, missed jeff green for 3 games, missed dinwiddie  but sure, 'both teams were injured'"
JaMychal Green maybe? Jeff Green? Thad Young?
Donte doesn’t equate to shit when Irving and harden and dinwiddie and aldridge and Jeff green are injured for the opposing team
Jeff Green in absolute shambles
games 5 and 7 were the best games of the entire playoffs  jeff green randomly hitting 8 threes in a row was hilarious
"&gt; Would the Celtics still trade for KG and Ray if that deal happened?   No.  Pierce was at his breaking point with the Celtics burning his prime while trying to rebuild.  It was very much a shit or get off the pot moment for Ainge, and Ainge decided to go all in with the KG/Allen deals.  That made Pierce happy.  If they made this trade, they would've gone full rebuild around Rondo, Jefferson, Jeff Green, and all the assets they ended up with from this trade.  (No idea who, but it was probably a pretty good haul)"
"""Jeff Green's contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap""  How tf do you even know that? The season hasn't started yet. You're only going off what you've seen, and I'm not even sure you saw it enough, because Green had his flaws too. Wasn't much of a defender and had plenty of super quiet games.  It's like anything the Nets did well, you're just tryna discredit because they're not the Lakers. Which... I mean, they signed washed players too. But washed doesn't always mean bad, depending on how the team uses them."
"&gt; I mean, what exactly could the Nets have done in your opinion to even have this supposed ""top 3"" offseason? Like that's ridiculous lol  Nets really couldn’t have. Unless they traded Joe Harris for like Myles Turner or something and ended the league. That’s what happens when you’re over the cap and can only offer minimum deals and a MLE.   &gt; I graded them on extending KD, which is enormous on its own right, because he's arguably the best player in the game right now. If not, top 3 no debate. THAT can't just be ignored, idk what you're talking about there.  But again there are 4 other franchise corner stones who got extended. They aren’t anywhere near mentioned as a top offseason winner. An extension, (unless it’s like Giannis when people think he was a strong chance at leaving) isn’t a big win. It’s a good move but if that’s your best move you’re not a top offseason.  &gt; Second, ""Mills was getting the deal no matter where he went"" What? So because that you think that, that automatically makes the Nets getting him a lesser value. And how does Millsap being a late signing matter? It's a signing in the offseason, who tf cares when it happens?  For Mills It means they’re a top FA destination and didn’t get huge discounts, unlike the Lakers. It doesn’t make it a lesser value but it puts the Lakers offseason over theirs, LAARP or not. Millsap is washed and if he was a hot FA commodity he’d be signed the first week.   &gt; And for as good as Jeff Green was, you're treating him like he would be the sole reason the Nets would win a championship. There's a reason why he's a journeyman.  You’re right but honestly Jeff Green’s contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap."
"OK whoa whoa, I didn't grade Brooklyn on the Harden/Kyrie probability. I graded them on extending KD, which is enormous on its own right, because he's arguably the best player in the game right now. If not, top 3 no debate. THAT can't just be ignored, idk what you're talking about there.  Second, ""Mills was getting the deal no matter where he went"" What? So because that you think that, that automatically makes the Nets getting him a lesser value. And how does Millsap being a late signing matter? It's a signing in the offseason, who tf cares when it happens?  And for as good as Jeff Green was, you're treating him like he would be the sole reason the Nets would win a championship. There's a reason why he's a journeyman.  I mean, what exactly could the Nets have done in your opinion to even have this supposed ""top 3"" offseason? Like that's ridiculous lol"
"&gt; Extending KD highly ups the chance Kyrie and Harden stay  Makes no sense to grade on what might happen. Why don’t we go ahead and give the Sixers an A+ since Simmons wanting out ups the chances the Sixers try to trade him for Dame? This team just does not have the additions to get the best offseason award. They only got a third of their big 3 extended chances or not and they lost Jeff Green. Even the Lakers got guys like Bazemore, Nunn and Monk to take discounts. Heck even the Warriors got two guys who had MLE offers for the minimum. Mills was getting that deal no matter where he went. Millsap was a late signing, James Johnson isn’t a huge addition, LMA shouldn’t even count as an addition imo. Did bring back Brown for cheap so that’s an extra point, but they lost Jeff Green. That’s not a top 3 offseason."
"Extended not re-signed. Curry, Doncic, SGA, Trae Young, Embiid, Jimmy Butler, and Julius Randle got extended. Doesn’t make those teams winners. Also the Nets STILL have Harden and Irving as FAs next season so it’s not like that extension assures their core stays together for multiple seasons or something. Signing solid bench players is just that, solid. Not great and definitely not a win since none of those bench players even took discounts. Also lost a huge contributor in Jeff Green. They aren’t a winner, they aren’t a loser, but they are somewhere in between."
"They also lost Jeff Green, which is a pretty sizable loss considering they really needed versatile defensive role players."
"Did you edit your comment? Could of sworn you put Joe Harris instead of Jeff Green. Nonetheless, I was just giving examples of long, strong players who could help build a wall (which you'd really want 3 players to help execute here). Heat also had Jimmy Butler, Iggy, and Olynik to help Bam/Crowder.   To put it into perspective the Suns had Cam Johnson as their 3rd biggest player at 210 pounds. The Heat had 7 players bigger than Cam playing in that series. Giannis averaged 21 points vs the Heat."
"The Suns were probably like the 5th best team in the West with everyone healthy, like even the Mavs were tougher to beat.     This was just a super weak Finals, we saw Giannis in the 2nd round struggling to score against the Nets with BG, Jeff Green, KD and Claxton as their best defenders lol"
I’m not gonna argue ab Harden cause I agree with 2018 it wasn’t his fault  I do disagree ab KD against the Bucks tho. It was a a amazing carry job but I can’t use KD’s 2 games to override what Steph did all season. Also KD’s help that series was underrated cause Jeff Green and Blake Griffin were really good while Middleton and Jrue were cheeks in games 5 and 7 and almost shot the Bucks out of the game
"Rubio's not bad, I can understand drafting someone who balled out against team USA as a teenager. Even now he's about what you usually expect from a 5th pick.   For reference, other 5th picks from 2005-2015: Hezonja, Exum, Alex Len, Thomas Robinson, Valanciunas, Cousins, Love, Jeff Green, Shelden Williams, and Raymond Felton.  Flynn was a mistake though."
"I think he is the best player, but KD, Giannis, Bron all have legit case, Steph even has one (a bit less legit, 2 way play matters, not that he's horrible defensively).  KD was the best player in that Milwaukee series, but let's not act like it wasn't close 35/11/5 on 59%TS vs 32/13/4 on 59%TS.  And let's not continue the ""KD almost won the series by himself"" while he had Kyrie for 2 of the 3 games he won in that series (oh and btw the one game he won ""alone"" Jeff Green actually outscored every non Giannis Buck)."
"LeBron was an expiring in 2009  If you trade Russ, KD, and four first rounders for him, you have a OKC team with LeBron with a 1 year contract, Jeff Green, Thabo, and Nick Collison  You also don’t have the assets to get a second star  You might win 40-45 games in lebron’s lone year in Oklahoma but you don’t win anything and LeBron leaves the following year and you’re left with nothing, and the Cavs are still a 50 win team with KD, Russ, and the players that won 65 games with LeBron plus they’ll have multiple high picks for years to come  Sure you’d have cap space after lebron leaves but you’ll be left to overpay average players that wouldn’t move the needle and OKC is at the bottom of the league for the next 5-6 years"
"so if Chandler's failed physical didn't bottom out the trade with the Hornets in 09 and the Thunder never need an impetus to trade away Jeff Green for him with a DPOY caliber center already on the roster, better 3 point shooting to surround their young core, all without having to pay 7 million dollars for a starting center who put up under 5 ppg in a finals series; that doesn't change the Thunder's future at all  and I'm the casual here"
Exposed yourself as a nephew with the Jeff green comment
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
LMA and Jeff Green are centers nowadays
Haslem is a cheerleader. same for Varejao. LMA is a PF that moved to C given the lack of mobility. Howard and Gasol are shell of their prime. Baynes was hot trash last season. Jeff green ain't no center.  I'll give you Al Horford.
except for that one time lance stepped on jeff green and broke his ankles. rondo was playing dead on the bench floor lol
No if it was just KD the entire series the series would have been over in 4 to 5 games depending if anyone else stepped up on the Nets. Out of the 4 games it was just KD he won once and would have even won that if it was for Jeff green going 8/9 from 3 lmao. “1 man show” my ass.
"This is false lmao.   He was up 2-1 before Kyrie went down. If Jeff green didn’t over perform in game 5 the series would have been over in 6. KD went like 0-5 or some shit in OT lol Giannis actually made a bucket to tie the game atleast in OT. Also both feet were on the line it wasn’t just a toe lmao.   I don’t think Giannis is better and I don’t think KD is. You can make arguments for both, but your argument is dumb as shit."

"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
The Nets didn't play Jeff Green enough in the playoffs anyway
For a while there I had trouble remembering who was Jeff Green and who was JaMychal. I got it now but that one always confused me.
"I'm not a nuggets fan and I wouldn't necessarily agree. I would reserve the ""terrible"" as descriptor for guys like Trae Young or Luke Kennard etc.  In fact I don't think I could argue for any center with minutes to be terrible at defense currently. Even guys like Enes Kanter or Jeff Green are somewhere from slighly negative to clear negatives.  With that in mind I don't really get why it's so impossible to argue for Jokic to being between slightly positive to neutral player on defense. I'm not even quite sure if he's in bottom 10 centers last season and I'd guess that there are less than 10 centers with decent minutes who actually were even negatives of defense."
Jeff Green was amazing that year on both sides of the ball. Small-ball 5 unlocked so many things for them. You just don't watch basketball
Doubt it. They got Jeff Green in free agency.  He’s actually the perfect fit next to jokic in my opinion
"no. jeff green had some big game for them last year, milsap can't replace the type of production"
"i mean, he probably could at like a fairly ineffective level without it looking like steph curry guarding a center, but he offers basically no rim protection, which draymond does at a pretty high level. He could do im sure as much as Jeff Green, but 1) its not like Green is great at it and 2) youre taking away one of his best assets, which is that hes one of, if not the, best perimeter defenders in the league. WE should've done it over Dwight at center, but it would still be a flawed lineup."
Huge pickup by the Nets they needed a guy to replace Jeff Green who was a solid role player last year for them
Jeff Green played the 4 and sometimes a small ball five. Millsap is filling in that gap where Jeff left
Nuggets got Jeff green from them I feel bad cause milsap helped Denver and went to high school here and yeah but he tries to go bully in the post and it's not working his three is better but he is a really streaky shooter and his d is bad anywhere but the post and he's too small there
"Is Simmons not able to? If PJ Tucker, Jeff Green and RoCo can play Center in the playoffs then i don’t see why Simmons cant."
"This is all hindsight. Before that season it wasn't unreasonable to expect good seasons out of IT and K Love who still should have been in their primes. D Rose and D Wade were both good vet sparkplugs. Plenty of decent to good role players (TT, Crowder, Korver, George Hill, Jeff Green). It looked awesome on paper, just like the current LAL. And the team wasn't awful, just underperformed expectations. Wouldn't surprise me if that happens to LAL this year too."
He’s not their starting center he started sometimes but Blake is worth a minimum to 5 mill he might become like a Jeff green who is serviceable but only gets Minimum contracts.
"definitely not a one for one, Jeff Green essentially got flipped for Patty Mills and Paul Millsap which i'd do any day"
"The difference there though is one team has LeBron, AD and Russ as its 3 best players. The other had LeBron, Love and... maybe Jeff Green, maybe George Hill"
Jeff Green was a big man who mostly played at the 5. Milsap too old and slow to play the 4 as a wing. I don't know what you're talking about.
Seems kinda fucked up to want to replace Jeff Green because of his sexual preference
"Again he’s a not a big man. He’s a straight replacement for Jeff Green, which is great"
"I wasn’t addressing patty mills. I was addressing this specific post and the signing of Millsap. And specifically the role he will play and the person who vacated that role he will play.   It’s fine to think that Patty Mills makes you better than last year. But that is not what the OP is positing. OP is claiming that because Millsap is a former all star, suddenly the nets have upgraded from Jeff Green. Which I think is an incorrect take."
"Jeff Green could ball, imma miss him forsure .. Excited for this signing tho, a nice replacement for Green"
"We got Mills for the same money that Jeff wanted and he’s a better player for us. Looking at it more like Mills + Millsap for Green, it’s a no brainer for us"
"Bruh , Jeff green was balling. U ain't watch any games"
I would bet money they use him as a small-ball 5 the way they used Jeff Green
"Are they better than they were yesterday? Probably. Millsap can give you some decent spot minutes as long as you don’t rely on him heavily.  Are they better than they were last year with Jeff Green in that role? Debatable.  The Denver Nuggets had the option available to them, and they chose to sign Jeff Green over Millsap. And this is an organization who not only was a contender, but has been fiercely loyal to their own guys and bringing them back for continuity.  If they made the decision that Jeff green was a better option for their backup frontcourt than Millsap was, that probably tells you something about where they see Paul at this stage of his career.  So if you believe that the Nets upgraded by going from Jeff Green to an aging Paul Millsap, that’s fine (and trust me, I love dad as much as anyone), but just know that one of the shrewdest FOs in basketball right now is actively disagreeing with that take."
Idk about other fans but I think it’s safe to say that most of us are not expecting that. I like millsap and think he’ll fit in great but Jeff Green was nothing short of amazing for us last year. I was so happy with him I even sent an insta message thanking him when left lmao
"I would agree but mills is considerably better than mike James, or Tyler Johnson. He fills the need for the backup guard we needed. Can Thomas although I’m very excited about him I don’t know what he’s role will be yet. Jeff green is better than millsap but on this nets team that gap won’t be extremely noticeable. Other than that yeah pretty much the same although our end of the bench guys are better than last years."
Jeff Green wasn’t so playable this playoffs either   Care to make a bet?
Hard to say in a vacuum  I think Jeff Green is a better fit for us just because Millsap is pretty redundant with JaMychal Green and our bench is desperate for shooting and athleticism.
The Nets technically swapped Jeff Green to the Nuggets for Paul Millsap
"Jeff Green is actually pretty underrated IMO. He got cooked on occasion because the Nets didn't have a real Center rotation, but I think he'll impress in Denver."
Makes sense. Nets lost their true weapon Jeff Green though.
"&gt; Jeff Green was huge for the nets in the playoffs.  He didnt play in 3 of the games in the series and played 12 min in game 7, just say you only remember one particular game."
Green is definitely better than millsap at this point of his career but the nets essentially chose patty mills and millsap over only jeff green. It’s a good flip imo
Nah we essentially chose patty mills and millsap over just jeff green. Good flip imo
"He is considerably worse than Jeff Green on defense right now. Don't get me wrong, I love Millsap, and he can still give a team some spacing and some very irregular scoring in the post. But his defense is kind of done, besides guarding some centers one on one for limited minutes."
"Jeff Green was absolutely amazing. I can’t believe we let him go especially considering how much he got paid.  He was what we all thought Joe Harris would be in the playoffs. Every time he shot the 3, it felt like it would always go in."
"He can still take some small ball center minutes coming off the bench, but it's still a downgrade from Jeff Green, the guy who was doing it last season. He is mostly there to take DeAndre Jordan's minutes and be insurance against injury and provide veteran leadership."
Gonna Miss Jeff green on this team &amp; Lamarcus Would still be cool but nice move
I disagree I think at this point in his career Jeff Green is better. He was extremely solid from what I watched when I watched Brooklyn games last year i thought they should have kept him
"Oh the same Millsap that shot 43.5% and 34% from 3 the last two years?   That number is going up higher playing with Harden  And for defense, yeah he’s no longer elite and he’s far from it. But he’s not worse than Jeff Green for instance"
"Lol, Nuggets going fron Milsap to Jeff Green is a massive upgrade"
do you even watch basketball lmfaoo what are you talking about? Jeff Green was huge for the nets in the playoffs. in fact he was one of the nets most consistent role players through out the entire season.
Jeff Green was injured
Did we watch the same playoffs?? Jeff Green had a huge role for us in both rounds. I don't expect Millsap to hit huge 3s but he still brings some important defensive energy
"He's a capable replacement for Jeff Green, but I actually think the Nets are gonna miss him. I think people are gonna overrate this Millsap signing, and underrate Green to the Nuggets who can cook as a 4 next to Jokic or small ball 5."
"Jeff Green is a really great roleplayer, I don't think Milsap is better"
You mean the same Jeff green who was out of the rotation for much of the playoffs? Yeah not exactly much of a case he’s going to be playing a meaningful role
so we traded jeff green for paul milsap lol
Jeff Green isn't as washed
Jeff Green. He’s the one who signed for several millions of dollars more than Millsap in the exact same market.
"Jeff Green is definitely better than Paul Millsap, but Millsap is definitely a solid pick up nonetheless."
Great signing.  Jeff Green replacement
"honest question, who is a better role player: Jeff Green or Paul Millsap"
Great replacement of Jeff green.
"Jeff Green is probably more useful than Mills for us ,so in terms of roster changes we lost."
"I'd rather listen to Jeff Green, at least he's pretty talented. Perkins is just big."
Barkley is just being himself and is a respected NBA hall of famer. Perk tries to hard to sound like an og and a role player traded for Jeff Green.
"We beat them without PJ Dozier and Barton aswell lol, plus we added Jeff Green"
"We beat the Blazers with PJ Dozier (our best defender), Will Barton and Monte Motris injured lol. Getting them all back + Jeff Green and another offseason for MPJ to get better, we going to suprise people next year, even without Murray"
At least we got some use out of Jeff green
Except KD didn’t take us to 7 games. We were down 2-1 to KD AND Kyrie. After that we won 3 of the next 4 games. The one game the Nets did win was only because KD scored almost 50 and Jeff green dropped 27 with 7/8 from 3.   Never said we win against them but I would bet money we could take them to atleast 6 games. If Tatum won then a game against all 3 then the bucks could atleast win 2-3.

"Harris bricked so many open 3s all series long, what r u talking about... I remember him missing two 3s I couldn't believe he missed in game 7. In any case, you went up 2-0, check Middleton's and Jrue's stats these two games. No team wins a playoff game with 2 of its 3 best players shooting like that.  You lost 4 of the next 5 games. The one you won was rhat Jeff Green 6 threes game... Yeah, Nets are favorites with Harden healthy and Kyrie playing all 7. Favorites. Not champions. There have been bigger upsets in basketball than this Nets team losing."
Harris wasn’t getting open shots after game 4 because Giannis ran under Kyries ankle. Jeff green played well in game 5 and that’s why we won.
"Jeff Green single handedly won you game 5 with them shots. Harris was supposed to be the best 3 point shooter in the league, too bad you're now trying to change the narrative and make it sound like him taking open 3s is a bad thing because he bricked them.   Its not like Harden hadn't bricked a shit ton of 3s in other postseasons. 0/27. Or check the Blazers, Spurs, Heat, Clippers series he's had. Who's to say he doesn't choke again?"
How about taking shots from joe Harris mike James Jeff green and Bruce brown ?  This argument by bucks fans is hilarious. I get that you wanna believe in the team but acting like somehow harden being there would take shots from Durant is bad is crazy. He creates easy shots for everyone and he was actually still playing and taking shots he just couldn’t drive at all or shoot so he sucked. He’d be taking shots from himself basically and being a lot better on offense and defense e
"Jeff Green was a great stretch four or even a small ball five, who could defend and shoot. Now that he is gone I wonder if they will continue the small ball lineups as often"
"I think Nets are one of my favourites for 'winning' the offseason. Getting Blake Griffin back on a minimum makes me extremely bitter, Patty Mills should hopefully be a strong addition, but really all they needed to do was get KD/Kyrie/Harden to sign extensions and it's looking like they have so far.  That said, Jeff Green is a bigger loss than a lot will recognise imo."
"They didn’t sign much this off season. They let go of Jeff Green and signed Patty Mills in his place. If they get Millsap, they’ll probably let go of one of the deep bench."
"Denver vs. Bucks  If Jamal Murray gets back healthy, there’s no guarantee AT ALL that Lakers are the top team in the West. Denver was amazing post-AG Trade and now they have also added a bit of depth with Jeff Green.  Each playoffs, someone has been hurt (Barton, Murray, Monte Morris, or Gary Harris) and yet Jokic has been great and Denver has had some big wins.   Bucks I think has to be a bet on Nets being injured. Especially now without PJ Tucker who was needed to guard KD, I don’t see any chance the Bucks getting past a healthy Nets team. It needs to be KD that’s hurt for the Bucks to advance imo."
nets didnt have spencer dinwiddie? And jeff green was back in teh second half of that series is why i mentioned him. he wasnt there and we were still beting them without kyrie.
Bucks didn't have their starting sg who is their second best on ball defender and a lot more important than Jeff Green.
What about game 1? Nets didn’t even have Jeff green in those early games. Series was done
They were beating the bucks with just kyrie and Durant and Jeff green was missing for those games.
"Gotta admit, the thought of Jeff Green is a little funny."
"A new year, Jeff Green on a new great team."
"&gt;For the simple fact that Nets has shown that astronomical offense can win you games with lesser defense.  same goes for astronmical D. heard of the pistons? Jeff green went god mod in game 5, played better than Khris IMO And yeah KD didn't really have help, but he also didn't win more than one game without help"
Jeff Green can fucking get up there man
Jeff green
Josh Smith Marvin Williams Jeff Green Batum Marion Harrison Barnes Josh Childress Michael Carter William Richard Jefferson Kyle Anderson Shareef Abdur-Rahim Paul Millsap Brian Shaw Beno Udrih Aaron Gordon Fultz Stephen Jackson Caron Butler Tuerie Evans Lance Stephenson

"Game 5 of the eastern conference semifinals between nets bucks.   Nets were missing Harden and Irving and outside of KD not a single player could make a shot…. Except Jeff Green.   He went 8-11, including 7-8 from 3, scoring 27 points in a game where all other non-KD nets players went 14-43."
"I love KD lol wtf? I have no problem with him.   I’m not saying he wasn’t godly because he was, but saying “he took us to game 7 by himself “ is not the truth. He won one game after Kyrie went down and wouldn’t have even won that if it wasn’t for Jeff Green but no one can admit that."
Jeff Green and the refs carried KD game 5 and 7 respectively.
I remember before game 7 vs the Celtics I was thinking who tf is he gonna rely on and it eneded up being Jeff Green.
"Again, if you woulda actually read it asks how we go from almost getting swept by the Heat to sweeping them in a year. Has nothing to do with the rest of the playoffs.   You can call it the worst “defense” but the Nets would have lost by atleast 10 or so points if Jeff Green didn’t score 27 pts that game."
"&gt;  it wasn’t just a one man thing because green stepped up big that game.   LOL. ""Jeff Green was a monster"" is the worst defense I've seen.    &gt; We can’t help what happened.  1000% true. It doesn't take away from that chip. But it certainly was a huge reason why you guys were able to go from getting wiped in 2020 to winning a chip in 2021.   Same story for the Suns too on making the finals. Yes, they played their best and beat nearly every opponent they faced, but one of the biggest reasons for their out-of-playoffs --&gt; NBA Finals leap is a heavily weakened Western conference playoff field."
Probably the current Bucks championship team. They played well but consider the number of teams who lost players to injuries. Every year a team(s) loses a key player to injury which might have changed the outcome of who goes on to win the championship.  This past season PHX and the Bucks suffered the least major injuries at the time of the play-offs.   In my opinion no way PHX or Bucks make the finals if injuries don’t decimate other teams. I mean the Bucks were 49 points down to the Nets in game two of the play-offs having suffered season ending injuries to Dinwiddie and LMA while Harden and Jeff Green were out of the first games of the series.
Damn Jeff Green was a Supersonic. Props to him for still playing.
Cant wait til (Jeff) Green is being guarded by (Draymond) Green and kicks the ball out to (Jamychal) Green
I feel like that happens with Jeff Green with every other team he's been on.  I forget sometimes that he was on the Clippers.
"[Yep, this was just 10 months ago:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)  &gt; ""I did this off-the-bench stuff already in two years with OKC,"" Schroder, who finished second behind teammate Montrezl Harrell for Sixth Man of the Year for his role with the Thunder, said on an introductory videoconference call with reporters Monday. ""I think I try to move forward, and I think with [Anthony Davis] and LeBron, I can be helpful as a starter in the PG position.""  &gt; Schroder said that he has not spoken to Lakers coach Frank Vogel about his desire to start, however his representatives, Alex Saratsis and Jeff Austin of Octagon, discussed that aspect with the Lakers front office prior to L.A.'s trading guard Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in the draft to the Thunder to complete the deal.  &gt; ""I think my agent talked to the organization before they was trading me,"" he said ""So, that's that.""  I guess the selfish approach didn't work towards getting himself paid so now he's willing to try being a team player and see if that works."
Jeff green for about 2 months into his rookie year
"From the article I linked in my original post:  &gt;When the trade was first reported on draft night, it would’ve been tough to find anyone that liked the deal for the Celtics.   Then-ESPN analyst and writer Bill Simmons, a noted Celtics fan, set the tone for the reaction when the details first emerged during ESPN’s NBA Draft coverage.   “Gerald Wallace’s contract is terrible. It’s $30 million for three years. It’s a big contract to take on for three first-round picks that aren’t lottery picks,” Simmons said during ESPN’s draft coverage that year.   “My first reaction though, Paul Pierce drafted by the team in 1998, played the last 15 seasons, and was somebody I hoped would retire with the Celtics,” Simmons added. “That’s only happened a handful of times where somebody gets drafted, plays 15, 16 years with the same team and retires. So, just to see him another team will be weird. KG’s another guy who’s going to get his number retired.   “I thought this was 35 cents on the dollar. There’s no guaranteed any of those picks will get in the lottery. Look at what just happened with Oklahoma City. They thought they were getting this juicy lottery pick and it ended up being No. 12. \[The Celtics\] are gutting the team, and it’s not like they have salary cap flexibility because \[Rajon\] Rondo makes big money. Jeff Green and Wallace combined make $20 million next year. So, it’s not like they’re gutting the team getting to start over.”   Then-ESPN Celtics writer Chris Forsberg gave any Nets fans that may have been worried about getting Pierce and Garnett at such an old age assurance that they could still be integral parts to a title team.   “The Nets should be pretty good for the foreseeable future,” Forsberg wrote. “Three guys with rings are a nice return for what could be three late first-round picks — and, hey, if nothing else, Boston took Gerald Wallace’s contract off Brooklyn’s hands. There’s a lot to like in this deal for the Nets, and you’ll especially appreciate what they got when the playoffs roll around.”"
"He didn’t single handedly win game 5 lmao if Jeff green did shoot 8/9 from 3 that would have been close to a blowout loss for the Nets even with KD scoring what he did, that just shows you didn’t even watch it lmao.   Again, noones taking about who the best is aside from you lol"
"I mean, I don't think ""it didn't work with a washed-up Dwight"" is argument for ""Simmons can't play with a rim-runner."" There are other kinds of non-shooting centers, though for starters Myles Turner and Christian Wood would both be perfect fits with Simmons. Also a lot of PFs who can play small-ball 5 would be good too - Jeff Green, Millsap and Tucker, at least back before they were this old, Thad Young, Dario Saric."
Jeff Green is so good man.  He’s been such a versatile player.  You wouldn’t blink if he was playing point guard or power forward.
"Sure but it depends how healthy they rest of the squad is. Blake, LMA, not the healthiest frontcourt cats typically. Without Jeff Green this year, they’re lacking depth. Could be worse obviously, and a healthy KD+Harden could definitely suffice."
Unbelievable that there isn't a single mention of Jeff Green in here. I thought he was gonna be one of the best players in the league.
You just reminded me of Gerald Wallace.   Also Jeff Green.
"This is going back a while--Jeff Green. He was the centerpiece of the Perk trade and had these flashes where he looked as good as Jaylen Brown last season (so, a solid all star player).   He just never did it consistently. I'm kind of astounded his career has been as long as it has."
"Jeff Green, Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris?"
"KD making he series close with Jeff Green as his 2nd best player was amazing. Dude was playing 48 minutes each game and barely lost game 7 in OT due to fatigue. KD’s defense is great, and you’re underrating how good ISO ball is with KD one of the most efficient scorers of all time"
"Your comment really confuses me. On one hand (when you're talking about Jordan) you seem to be thoughtful and analytical...but then when you're talking about Lebron you're exceedingly disingenuous.   For example   &gt;For eight years, the only real series Lebron had was the Finals.   What do you mean by ""real series"". I need you to give me a quantitative definition of this so we can evaluate how many real series Lebron had and how many MJ had. Was the bulls-knicks 7 game series in 91-92 or the 6 game series in 92-93 a real series? Why are those real series yet the heat beating a bulls team (that had better regular season records than those knicks teams) isn't?     &gt;He nearly lost twice to baby PG and Roy Hibbert. He got dragged to seven games by a group of rookies and second year players in Boston with Kyrie out.  What does nearly lost mean in this context and why does it matter? Does it mean being pushed to 7 or 6 games like those pacers teams did to the heat? Okay so should we hold it against MJ that he ""nearly lost"" against the 91 and 92 knicks, 98 pacers, 92 cavs etc? Why do any of those wins matter more than Lebron's teams coming from behind to beat the 2012 pacers and celtics without Bosh and a declining D Wade?  Should we dismiss MJ's wins against the knicks because they came against a team with John Starks as its second best player or ""almost losing"" to the pacers who had Rik Smits as their second best player?   How can you honestly say with a straight face that Lebron's playoff wins against the 2018 raptors or celtics teams don't matter when he had Jeff Green as his 2nd best player and arguably put up the greatest solo playoff run of his career?  Like I said earlier, on the surface you appear to be engaging in good faith but then your arguments are clearly biased and one sided. I would love for you to set a quantitative line on what a real playoff series so we can evaluate how many real playoff series both MJ and Lebron had in their eastern conference playoff runs"
"I know Boston fans love to bring up that move time and time again, but both that Sac pick and that Memphis pick from the Jeff Green trade ended up having a lot more speculative value than actual value.  Does Boston take that trade 10/10 times? Yes, but it's not like Romeo Langford has made a huge splash in the league."
My parlay with the over 8.5 on Jeff Green was in real danger there for a minute.
Jeff green lookin bad this game
Jeff Green attacking the basket was exactly what Nuggets were missing last years.
i love how we're attacking rn and once again **Jeff Green transition god**
"The thing is, it's not too hard to be ahead of the curve as far as sports goes. The bar is so low.  1. Most people don't watch lots of games of unpopular teams. If EG was watching every Nuggets game (which I assume he was), that's probably far more views of Jokic than 99% of people on this sub. You can get a really solid sense of how good a player is over that kind of sample size. 2. EG trusted the advanced stats, and most people are dunces that don't. I had a similar experience before last season telling everyone that Timelord (Robert Williams) was the future and that he should absolutely start from day 1. His per-36 stats were off the chart and every time he entered the game he had an immediate impact. If you trusted the advanced stats, it can be obvious that a player is really, really good. Most people don't actually believe the advanced stats. They also make stupid arguments that have been disproven by data like ""yeah but it's against other bench players"" and ""that won't last if he has to do it for 40 minutes instead of 8"". Turns out, per-36 almost always extends as long as you have a decent sample size, like an entire season at around 8-10 minutes per game. Just believing advanced stats gets you a massive edge. I can remember the morons defending the OKC James Harden trade like it was yesterday... 3. Unconventional wisdom is shouted down by sports fans... until it's not. Basically, you could argue that someone played at an all-star level but a mob of people will downvote you unless they were an actual all-star that year or in the past. There's a strong bias on r/nba to confirm what's already known and not anticipate the future. Hence, bench players are perpetually underrated as mere ""bench players"" until suddenly they're starting and everyone now says they're starter material. Anyone who says ""X player should actually be starting because they're excellent"" is shouted down into oblivion. Only after something becomes conventional wisdom is it accepted.  On this final point, I was saying to everyone who would listen to me last year that Tatum was overrated and should be traded while he was still being overrated and the Celtics could get a massive haul for him. People thought I was legitimately insane. Guess who's laughing now? The funny thing is, some people think he's just slumping and still refuse to believe he's not that good because people talked about him like he was the next Kobe and can't get over the fact that he's not. In fact, some people latch so hard and ignore the advanced stats so hard that they'll never get away from this notion. It's shit like this that caused Jeff Green to be traded to like 11 different teams or whatever. People couldn't just give up on the guy and say ""okay he's not actually that good"".  If you avoid falling for these traps you can get a pretty good sense of who is good and who isn't and what a player's peak will be."
"He reinvented his career as a small-ball 5 and I'm glad to see it.   I remember a great quote from somewhere on Reddit a few years ago, ""The idea of Jeff Green is better than the actual Jeff Green.""  Now you can swap that with Kent Bazemore instead."
Imagine Rubio/Jeff Green instead of the Williams in 2017 :(
Harden on 1 leg  Lma  Jeff Green out until game 5
The Harden behind the back bounce pass to Jeff Green for 3 was like 95% i swear
Jeff Green transition god
"Jeff Green with better defense than advertised, but a less consistent jumpshot. Jaylen Brown but much more raw. Bigger Shawn Marion? Idk"
"Players basketball reference lists as centers who take more than that per game: 17 (KAT, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Horford, Jokic, Bamba, Olynyk, Vucevic, Wendell Carter, Jr., Muscala, Sabonis, Theis, Mo Wagner, Bjelica, Jeff Green, Anthony Davis, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl)  And that's just on a per-game basis - if we did per 36 I'm sure that number would be significantly higher.  I'm not trying to disrespect Valanciunas - he's a good player - it just never made sense that people were claiming that he's a floor-spacing 5"
"How is that revisionist history? This was hyped to be lebron's best supporting cast ever, which was then turned into ""trash"" once they couldn't get the chemistry going 4 months before the playoffs (SHOCKING, maybe don't trade half your team mid year), the team was solid on paper, better than any other team in the east, other than the healthy celtics (which missed Kyrie and GH).   Hood, Clarkson, Jeff Green, Nance, TT and George Hill all did great after the team was blown up, and Love would've been good too if he didn't basically miss 2 seasons"
"Yeah, people forget (or just weren’t watching the NBA at the time) that Harden’s talent didn’t just jump out at you his first 2.5 years in the league. A lot of people were extremely underwhelmed by him. He didn’t start taking off until we traded Jeff Green. Then the next year he win 6MOY and the rest is unfortunate history as a Thunder fan."
Let's not do that. Bosh and love were never winning players without him. Jeff Green had always been good. Trezz and Drummond were casualties by Vogel being weird with their lineups.  Kuz definitely has a longer leash now and is playing good.
Jeff Green = 2nd best player in the playoffs on that 2018 Cavs team   Drummond = literally played 3 regular season games with Lebron   Kuz = averaged 19/5/2 next to Lebron   mfs really just get in here and lie lmao Harden went from looking like the GOAT scorer to now barely putting up 20 points a game when he started playing next to KD. i guess Durant makes players worse
"Part of that is on him though. Look at how guys like Bosh and Love were doing before him. Even role players like Jeff Green, Drummond, Kuz and Trezz are doing better without him."
It’s debatable. Nets played a closing lineup of kyrie harden joe Harris Durant and Jeff green that pretty much only had one good defender in Durant and one decent one in green. But it was so offensively potent that it didn’t matter. Similarly the warriors could do that approach and still have draymond and Wiggins for defensive stoppers.    Regardless wiseman again won’t be playing in that lineup so lamelo is still better.
Bad take I’m surprised to see upvoted. I mean he shot 7-10 from 3 the game before. Who thought Lonzo was gonna keep shooting 70% from 3? This is regular variance and is true of about every player in the league. Steph &amp; Klay are the goat shooters they regularly go through shooting slumps/have bad shooting games.       He’s a 42% 3-point shooter on the season. Inconsistent is someone like Jeff Green whose feast or famine.    Plus this is a good defensive team and were missing several pieces including just losing our starting C I’m not sure this is the game you can point to as evidence he’s inconsistent when there’s so many confounding variables.
"you're dumb. Nash coached an excellent series, you might have forgotten but Kyrie got injured after game 2, Joe Harris forgot how to shoot, Harden and Jeff Green were hurt, they didn't have a playable center, and they still were able to limit the Bucks offense and keep the series close.  I mean for FFS Harden came back and played 40 minutes without being able to jog let alone run, and they still managed to almost win g7."
why the hell Nets let Jeff Green walked?
He could be Jeff green jr if he plays his cards right. And there’s nothing wrong with that.
"Expect it at this point. Someone who really shouldn't pops off for 20-30 on us. (See Jalen Brunson, Doug McDermott, rookie season Tyler Herro, Jeff Green, Mo Wagner, etc)."
"Any crossover where the ballhandler steps on the defenders foot, ie Curry on CP3 or Lance on Jeff Green"
"Lol stop with that narrative.   KD had Kyrie for 3 and half games, after that KD lost 2/3 games and only won the one because Jeff green went off. Sick of the “KD took them to game 7 by himself”  Also if you’re gonna use the finals series for the Heat use our final series. You pick probably one of their best series and then pick our worst series lol"
Against JayMychal &amp; Jeff Green?
"how good would the all-color team be  Jaylen Brown  Jeff Green  Draymond Green  Derrick White  Bruce Brown  Bench:  Danny Green  Cam Reddish  Derrick Rose   What if you added LeBrown James, Kelly Ochre Jr. and Bradley Teal"
"Piggybacking off of both what the guy you responded to said and yourself, I believe that we will end up shopping Donte for a backup 4/5. Our lack of depth in that area has been a red flag since the start of last season. We were incredibly fortunate to get PJ and then (mostly) avoid injuries to our frontcourt rotation. With PJ gone, I really thought getting somebody like Jeff Green needed to be a priority, but we didn’t.  So, I wouldn’t be particularly shocked if, with a potential extension looming, Grayson’s hot start, and the uncertainty about BroLo, we end up making some sort of Donte for Thad Young + a 2nd round pick deal or something like that. Giannisly, if he didn’t seem like an entitled kid as opposed to a young player willing to make the most of his opportunities and prove himself, I’d be up for us going after Badgley. But, alas, he is.  Any other backup, quality 4/5 guys y’all could see us going after? I think we basically just need solid D and the ability to at least hit a mid-range jumper."
"Jeff Green has had an open heart surgery and made it back to the league. Don't know if that's a physical disability, but that's some hardcore stuff."
"Him, Jeff Green, Ingles, keeping Pat Bev all are good fits. They are way too young with way too many holes on the roster to be winning anything as of right now"
I am slow but was Cancar part of the trade for Jeff Green?  Was wondering who was 2nd choice C for Nuggs when I saw JMych at C (isn't he usually a PF too?)
Jeff Green is a dumb Lebron
"I’m not sure it’s specific to basketball. I think it’s just guys with congenital heart defects that go unaccounted for until it’s too late. It’s more surprising to me that guys like Rudy Gay (or was it Jeff Green?), Channing Frye, or Aldridge can go through college, combine, and nba medical evaluations without it getting caught until later into their nba careers."
https://thecomeback.com/nba/orlando-magic-leak-offseason-plans.html  Is there anybody else on the list beside Aminu that actually ended up playing for the Magic? He was the only one I could spot.  Edit: Jeff Green too.
"People who have half a brain realize that take fouls happen all the time. It was a 4 on 5 since Bam was on the floor and Jokic himself said he saw him coming in for the foul lmao. The difference is that most basketball players don't throw a temper tantrum when they get fouled hard. Which is what Jeff Green was getting at and why he isn't dickriding Jokic for acting like a child. Shaq and Barkley also notoriously say dumb shit and try to keep up their own tough guy image. I highly doubt either of them would've blindsided Morris in the back, they would've just gotten him back next possession like they always did."
Jeff Green sucks
"It’s gotta be Jeff Green  [When they were both on the Cavs, sometimes you would think Green was LeBron for half a sec lol](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/29/sports/29araton1/merlin_138764076_db20a0a7-b789-4652-af01-b9dc8754335b-superJumbo.jpg)  [Bradley Beal once said Jeff Green was basically LeBron](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2800529-bradley-beal-on-jeff-green-hes-built-like-lebron-and-almost-plays-like-him)"
For sure! I just posted recently that Plumlee was their last good backup center. Good enough to find a starting gig elsewhere and kind of suck for Charlotte. He’s a good backup though. They definitely need a backup center to help spell Jokic a bit and not be terrible. Crazy they use Jeff Green a lot as a small ball center.
"I mean the average person shouldn't fuck with any NBA player including the ones that are the sons of NBA players and grew up with money. They're super human athletes and could fuck up a massive majority of the population.   I'm from the DMV. I'm not fucking with a soul from there whether it's KD, Michael Beasley, Quinn Cook, Dipo, Fultz, Jerami Grant, Jeff Green, etc. Just cause they not from a country that's got it tougher don't mean they ain't with the shit"
"This is the right answer, absolutely the strongest guy in the league right now. He’s usually pretty quiet but he’ll be tough when he has to. Rearranging Pat Bev’s skeleton, that one guy who tried to push him and ending up pushing himself, or making Jeff green crumble the other night"
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Ginóbili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

"Jeff Green is a bitch with that take. Gtfo here, no intent to injure? Morris has a history of intent to injure."
You never know what to expect from Jeff Green.
Jeff Green is lame for going against his own teammate especially when he’s wrong.
Jeff green almost took out bam’s knee earlier in the game.  Maybe he thought it was payback lol
Bam did the same to Jeff Green earlier in the game
"Half time thoughts:  Neither team can hit 3s so the team that put more pressure on the rim has the lead. Jokic doing a good job stopping drives with help and forcing contested pull-up jumpers. Nuggets 14/15 at the rim while Miami is only 6/9. Basically how Denver has managed to win games  No Facu is a key to the bench success. When your ball handlers are scoring threats that puts pressure on the defense and produces open shots.  JMyke looks really good defensively as a backup 5 and Jeff looks great as a 4 next to Jokic. Double Green might be dead after this game  Miami needs to quit switching because it took Robinson out of the game and Nuggets are too good at exploiting switches  Nuggets simply playing more athletic as well. Quicker first steps, faster, and jump higher"
Jeff Green starting for MPJ tonight
For Kyrie it was an accident and a foul was appropriately called but yeah I've seen him do that shit to Jeff Green
Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals than Jordan while being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Jeff hornasec and Danny ainge   Jordan would be a poor man dorezen if he played outside the shit 90s
Jeff Green ISO at the elbow is really the Nuggets best play with the bench unit?
"Bruh, he was there the whole of last season...you sure you dont mean Jeff Green?"
"I think he's suppose to be their PF. But Jeff Green is playing even worst, so they got Ja playing C."
seriously? Jeff Green was an absolute stud for the nets
Jeff Green
Didn't they also lose Jeff Green to heart surgery during this time as well?
The next Jeff Green but hot
"Love played like 19 games the following season. So yes they didn’t have him either. Jeff Green, JR smith, and Crowder along with basically all their vet guys were gone too. It was basically a whole different team.   Yes Lebron took them to the finals in one of the weakest conferences ever, and then promptly got swept. The best team in the conference that season featured Demar as their best player."
"Best thing about this is how long Adams stands there after the screen trying to help Jeff Green up, love Adams for that 😂 Jeff didn’t realize till it was too late though and Adams had to start rolling to the basket"
"Love me an Adams screen.   Also, why does it take Jeff Green 3 seconds to reach the ground? He fell down slower than Eddie Murphy's aunt fell down the stairs."
Like out of everyone on the nuggets roster my guy picked jeff green
he really said jeff green man im creasing
Jeff Green (should have) contemplated retirement after (the 2015 season).
the mavs have porbumgis who's not even playing and nobody else outside of luka while the nuggets have MPJ and jeff green
I miss him dearly. He worked hard to get to where he is now. Plus he’s such a likeable player as well. I remember we waived Jeff Green because they wanted to give Niang more playing time.  He was part of the Jazz death lineup which would just bury you with three’s  Would take him back in a heartbeat
Jeff Green would make the All-NBA AARP 1st team without a doubt
I miss the days of lightskin Rudy Gay and Flattop Jeff Green
"If this Thunder team happened just 5 years later, they probably don't make that Jeff Green for Perkins trade.   Russ-Harden-KD-Green-Ibaka would be their closing 5."
"More realistically, Jeff Green would’ve played the 4, shifting Ibaka to the 5."
With this quote I really don’t understand why they don’t sign Cousins to a vet minimum contract. Nuggets badly need a backup C because Jeff and JaMychal Green are underwhelming and can’t protect the rim whatsoever. DMC can at least provide a cheap option to increase depth and a versatile skill set along with size.
"I feel like you guys will sort it out if you stay healthy. Us, dude, I don’t even know right now. Last year was pretty fucked but this feels like the darkest it’s been since… honestly maybe since 06-07 season. Even the 13-14 year was fun because we were expected to be a tanking team and they had a lot of fight despite being terrible. And that game winner from Jeff Green on Miami was incredible.  This year, after that 2OT against New York, it’s been… not fun."
"Facu, Rivers, Dozier, and two 30+ year old forwards in Jamychal and Jeff Green?  On paper there are some serious issues with the lineup.  Who in the world is going to score the ball?    In theory the bench works *when Murray is healthy.*  Although there is still a notable lack of an actual backup 5.  But when Murray is out, our bench is definitely not ""really good"" even in theory"
"The Chandler one is my biggest what-if because it probably pre-empts both the Perk and Harden trades, especially if OKC wins a chip before Harden is a FA. Plus Jeff Green is traded elsewhere for more bench depth at that point most likely.  The Harden trade, the problem is that there really were no better trade packages out there - Lowe covered it back then and GSW didn’t want to give up Klay, CHA didn’t want to trade the #2 pick, WAS didn’t want to trade Beal, even TOR didn’t want to trade JV. The next best package was ORL built around JJ Redick and picks (which would be a crazy what-if for the league overall).  Waiters was actually fine in that playoff run - the real problem was they didn’t have one last wing who could stay on the floor. Roberson eventually got figured out as the offensive liability he was (although he was mostly average shooting wise at that point he had the most wide open shots imaginable), Singler was a disaster, Heustis was a waste, Morrow was a huge minus on D, and Foye was bad too. Give them KCP in the Kanter trade instead of Singler and they win a chip I’m convinced.  I’ll add one more - what if Kawhi stays in TOR and PG/Russ get traded to TOR as rumored?"
Dos Verdes (Jeff Green and JaMychal Green) have been awful this year so far.
"That and also OKC would've kept Jeff Green in that trade, and he was still viewed as a very promising young player that could've been used in another trade"
"it was really kendrick perkins, believe it or not. ibaka was a lock to get that contract, and was paid rightfully so at the time. they didn’t want to extend jeff green, or pay him; so they dealt him for perkins thinking they needed a defensive c for the playoffs. not wanting to let perkins walk for nothing, they gave him $13m iirc in the offseason. the harden negotiations were off by about $3-$4m, then they trade harden away for kevin martin who quickly faded out of the league after that."
"as a man who's bet the nuggets a lot, i want to assassinate jeff green"
"1. Harden trade, nuff said. (I’d like to see the alternate universe where it’s OKC and ORL built around picks and JJ Redick who would’ve been great on those OKC teams, and the cascading effect on ORL/HOU/Lob City LAC without Redick)  2. Rescinding the Tyson Chandler trade - I put the Harden trade first as a hat-tip to consensus, but this one kills me worse.  3. Jeff Green over Joakim Noah. I’m not a fan of Noah really but he would have been a great C for those OKC teams and it prevents the Perk trade.  4. Draft misses - Byron Mullens, Cole Aldrich, Cam Payne, Mitch McGary, Josh Heustis, TFerg (over Anunoby ugh), trading Eric Bledsoe instead of just keeping him, Perry Jones  5. Promising Giannis to bring him over immediately instead of asking to stash him a year, and then taking him over Adams and Gobert over Roberson  6. Re-signing Kevin Martin instead of letting him walk, and moving on sooner from Jeremy Lamb and PJIII  7. The Perk trade"
Gerald Wallace inbound to Jeff Green for the buzzer
"Jeff Green over Lebron was amazing. As was the pass from Wallace.  The Bradley game winner in the regular season I enjoyed more, only because it was a wild ending with Smart ripping the rebound on a missed FT off Lebrons legs. I can't find the Full sequence of events... but man the Cavs announcers makes the clips for me. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ljBiuA8RU)"
I have two and they have a very similar theme  One is this Jeff Green buzzer beater over LeBron (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jCq6HjIJGw)  The second is the Avery Bradley buzzer beater in the ECF vs the CAVS
"Unpopular one here but that James Harden ""breaking"" Wes' ankles was just a push off.  Jeff Green handled himself ""getting crossed"" pretty well, too in his post game."
Jeff Green showed up like every 3rd game. Korver always looked good in early rounds and unplayable in later rounds
with respect to Korver he was a huge reason along with Jeff Green for why Bron even made the 2018 finals
"The Nets when Kyrie went down weren’t trash at all. It’s just that key guys played like trash in the Bucks after Kyrie’s injury. The infamous Joe Harris choke, then Harden not even being able to run a fastbreak due to injury, and the fact that the bench put up 0 shots in Game 7. Not make 0 shots, they shot 0 times. Of course players like Blake and Bruce Brown played well, and Jeff Green popped off in Game 5, but Milwaukee were just deeper once Kyrie went down. The Bucks could play guys like Connaughton and he provided for them in Game 7. Their starting lineup of Middleton, Holiday, Giannis, Tucker, and Lopez were also more consistent than the Net’s starting lineup barring Kd."
"Lol what, of course he’s a starter, I never claimed otherwise. He’s nowhere near an All Star though. What the fuck are you talking about? You’re bringing up All Stars in 2013 like that shit matters but apparently now you’re worried about current ability? Because on current ability, Khris Middleton is the one and only other All Star on the Bucks and has been for Giannis’ entire tenure.  Giannis lead the team in 4th quarter points by a huge margin, Jrue wasn’t responsible for closing at all. Middleton did, especially in that game 7 (13 points on 5/10 in the 4th/OT to Giannis’ 9 points on 4/5, take your pick I guess) but if he’d not shot **4/16** in the first three quarters we wouldn’t have needed a closer. As for defence, not so much against the Nets. Once Kyrie went down it was KD vs. the world, and PJ was on him. Jrue was mostly guarding crippled Harden and Khris was mostly guarding guys like Jeff Green and Joe Harris. Jrue’s defence was big in the ECF and Finals for sure, not so much the first two rounds."
"All-Greens:  Jalen Green, Josh Green, Jeff Green, Draymond Green, JaMychal Green.   6th man: Javonte Green"
Jeff Green. Guy has a handful of games every season where he looks like a perennial all-star.
"Jeff Green and Rudy Gay  So far into his career, Frank Ntilikina"
"i was wondering the same.. if you did combine Jeff and Jamychal's stats into one J. Green this season and they knew about it, could J. Green win MVP?"
When the hell did Jeff Green sneak off to Denver. How many forwards do they need?
WCS forgot he had arms. How was the view watching Jeff Green just make that layup?
The Nets are missing Jeff Green as well. He was so good for them last year.
"Could be worse, you could be the Celtics.  Lorded over us the first round pick we traded away eons ago for Jeff Green. Finally conveys at 14. Not a great pick, but you can get value. Grizzlies sit with no FRP.  Draft comes and they draft Aaron Nesmith at 14, projected elite shooter. But they have 2 more firsts and a full roster. Pick up Pritchard at 26.  30 rolls around and no way are they bringing in 3 rookies. So the Grizz send over two whatever future second round picks and jump in to nab Bane.  As we sit now Bane has proven to be an elite shooter, is already contributing to winning, and he is still getting better. Pritchard has proven to be a serviceable point guard, but isn't able to carve out a role for Boston. And Nesmith hasn't hit a shot this year and might not be on the roster next year.  Hate to be petty, but years of Boston fans gloating about how Ainge ""fleeced"" us lets me sleep well at night."
"The bulls? Honestly think they’re close and just need some reliable vets off the bench next to caruso. Like a Terrance Ross, thadeus young, Jeff green, patty mills, Alec burks, Derrick favors, etc type vets for a 9-10 deep playoff squad"
Make trades with what assets... Jeff Green? Tyler Johnson? 2030 and beyond 1st round picks?
"Fuck it, Jeff Green is the new PJ Tucker"
I just realized they even have Jeff Green!
"And on the other end both Philly and the Bucks who mainly play drop coverage will get eaten alive. Difference is you can double Embiid in the post, you can show help to Giannis isolating on KD or Jeff Green, not sure what you do when your scheme doesn't allow you to come of the paint when Kyrie/KD/Harden are coming of a PNR, especially because one of the 3 if not 2 will have a favorable match up"
"Replace DJ with Jeff Green to close out games as small ball 5.  Nets better offense, Warriors better defense and team synergy. Tossup but advantage warriors"
Claxton isn’t ready to fill in this much and Jeff Green shouldn’t be at the C spot. Definitely need someone there.
What about when they need to rest? Who’s coming in to score then? Jeff green? Or are Harden and KD playing 48 minutes?   Teams with good defense and depth are gonna pose a problem for them  Also finding guys how? Are guys appearing out of air to come play for the nets?
That’s a weird description of James harden and they have shamet and joe Harris along with Jeff green who all can be very valuable in the nba
Jeff Green at the 5 is lethal especially in MDA’s system  This Nets team is winning a championship if they can gel
"Their best lineup for now is probably what Houston did, small ball with Jeff Green at center. Then hit the buyout market hard for another big."
Jeff Green averaged 10 and 5. I don’t think he met the star threshold
Jeff Green is gonna be the new Tucker in that theyre gonna kill him making him play center
"Imagine having a team with Durant, Westbrook, Harden, and Jeff Green!"
yea even as a rookie he had jeff green
jeff green is already coming off the bench for brooklyn. sefolosha and roberson are free agents too. bring nick collison out of retirement.
"Ah yes, now we need to solve this with Jeff Green in the mix as well and keep the time complexity under O(n)."
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Their bench isn’t that bad. They will have Bruce brown and shamet and Jeff green off the bench. It’s not great but those guys can play a role in the nba  Either way they do have 3 open spots to fill so we will see how they do that
Jeff Green
They *do* already have Jeff Green. Give Thabo and Cole Aldrich a call they aren't doing anything they wouldn't drop for the NBA minimum.
"The Nets have 3 stars though. Harrell has yet to prove he’s playable in the playoffs. Gasol can be ran off the court. Kuzma can score but he’s inconsistent. KCP and Matthews has little worth if they can’t hit shots.  The Nets still have Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and although Jordan is a bit washed, he can still control the paint as the starting center. Jeff Green is pretty solid too."
The fairy tale of Jeff Green continues
"Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Claxton are all good bench players  If Shamet and TLC can get out of their funks they can be good contributors too"
Nets would abuse the ultra big lakers lineups. Lakers I think would have to play AD at the 5. I think montrez and gasol would be borderline unplayable for long stretches against the nets   Lakers have better chemistry but the nets do have some solid role guys still there in joe Harris Landry shamet and Bruce brown. I think they also still have Jeff green who can do some stuff
When you need a wall to beat Giannis you better have something more than Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan to build it
They definitely need another Center at the very least. Playing KD or Jeff Green there extensively will not work in the postseason and they don’t have anyone deserving of any minutes outside DeAndre Jordan there.  Maybe they can flip Joe Harris for more of a defensive player? Not sure if they could trade Dinwiddie still if he’s on the DPE.
"Now just flip Kyrie for Westbrook and Ibaka, and the nets already have Jeff Green. The cycle is almost complete"
So Jeff Green is about to be the East Coast PJ Tucker
"They have enough depth to support that starting lineup though is the funny thing. They also have the 5.7m tax ML and need another big and they are set.  TLC, Shamet, Jeff Green, Tyler Johnson arent bad players and we all know playoff time you only have a 8 -9 man roto. Lookin at a Javale type big on the buyout market too."
Jeff Green
"Now trade Kyrie for Russ. Kyrie would be in a better position to influence social justice reform in DC, and we get to realize the dream of the OKC trio reunion. Even Jeff Green is here!"
"&gt; TLC, Shamet, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and I'm guessing Tyler Johnson  Out of those, only Cabarot has looked good. Can he lead the 2nd unit, or are they gonna have to stagger Kyrie/KD/Harden w/ bench players? Definitely need to get another center. Losing Allen is huge considering how well he's been playing this season. Probably need more bench players at least for regular season for injury and COVID insurance..."
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
"Your best defenders are KD, then DeAndre Jordan who has looked really bad this year. After that Jeff Green and who???? Timothy Luwawu-Cabborat?  Even if it doesn’t end up a problem versus the 76ers I don’t think they can win a championship without more defensive help."
"DeAndre Jordan and Jeff Green lol  Harden Durant Kyrie is a monster offense, so many mismatches they can exploit"
Jeff Green
I'm assuming they might make another trade or sign a 3/D type player later akin to Jeff Green later in the season and trot out a smaller lineup with KD as a false 5.  I think their biggest issue now will be managing defensive rotations against guys like Giannis and AD
"Ehh, they had the deepest team in the league.  They’ll be fine with TLC and Jeff Green and um, Bruce Brown.  Pretty solid bench guards/wings.  Joe Harris at the 3.  Backup Center and frankly starting center is the real problem.  Against most teams it doesn’t matter but against Milwaukee, Philly and the Lakers they need a better big man then Deandre Jordan."
A Harden-Jeff Green pick and roll was often the best offensive option in the playoffs for the rockets last year
Where’s Jeff Green at? Get the gang back together  Edit: oh shit he’s already on the nets
Umm I don’t think Jeff Green at center worked wonders last year
How dare you leave out Jeff Green
"Brown, Shamet, TLC, Jeff Green, Claxton"
Don't count out Jeff Green just yet.
Maybe Jeff Green? Lol
"Kurucs wasn't playing and Prince has been awful since we got him. Losing Levert and Allen is obviously a killer for our depth with Dinwiddie out too. Bench would be TLC, Shamet, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and I'm guessing Tyler Johnson might get some minutes. Claxton seems to be out long term so we need to get another center somehow."
"Shamet, Meth Curry, Jeff Green, TLC, Bruce Brown"
jeff green?
"What’s the depth chart even looking like anymore?   On the wings and SG you got TLC, Joe Harris and Bruce Brown, and Jeff Green   Centre: DJ and Claxton?   This is looking really thin but I guess at all times one of the Big 3 will be on the floor and they’ll probably sign a few vet min guys"
Future mvp Jeff Green was on the sonics with him
"last 11-13 yrs?  wade, bosh, love, irving, shaq, ilgauskas, mo williams, hughes, szcerbiak, gooden, drose, isaiah thomas, boozer, mike miller, korver, mcgee, dwight, birdman, bibby, rashard lewis, battier, marion, rondo, AD, ingram, kuzma, ball, chandler, ray allen, haslem, jr smith, danny green, donyell marshall, david wesley, ben wallace, frye, shannon brown, james jones, hood, michael beasley, clarkson, jeff green, jefferson, snow, etc"
"As we know, only one person can shorten their name as a nickname  It's why Josh Howard is the only Josh allowed in NBA history  Also why I always make sure to say Jeffrey Green lest anyone disrespect Jeff Teague"
"Yea Jeff Green is solid as hell, he's been giving us good minutes"
It’s a team game sure but no one was as impactful as Bron and AD. Not even close. Rondo helped of course but it’s not like everyone else stepped up. And sure it helps having the point god be your second option who can run the offense when Harden sits and then surrounded by amazing 3-D players and an amazing defensive rim runner. While Bron ended up with Kyrie and bums. Love was just pathetic. And then Kyrie leaves and Bron was stuck with Green sometimes being the 2nd best player. Fucking Jeff Green. And no clearly he isn’t and Harden has never been better than LeBron this isn’t a serious question is it?
Jeff green as well who was really good despite his reputation
"Nets starters today: Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, KD, Jeff Green, Jarrett Allen   Nash either starts Bruce or doesnt play him at all, no in between lmfao"
Yeah C's just choked down the stretch. It's difficult playing against a motivated LeBron in crunch time.  Jeff Green also had the game of his career. I ain't even mad about that.
"Underrated?  Ok here's two, about the same team - OKC - less obvious ones than the Harden trade.  What if OKC drafted Joakim Noah instead of Jeff Green? Does a core of Harden/Westbrook/Noah/Durant go on to win a bunch of shit?  Probably.  Likewise, OKC had Tyson Chandler signed up - but didnt like his health check and he got sent back to New Orleans and then Dallas, where he became a vital cog in the Mavs championship winning team.  Does an OKC lineup of Westbrook/Harden/Durant/Chandler win a bunch of shit?  Probably.  OKC ownership  seemingly did everything in their power to NOT win a chip. And fuck em cause Seattle."
"Horford to Toronto is pretty interesting. I don’t think we’re in the running for Hill. Payton Pritchard has turned out to be a really good bench PG, especially for a rookie and Brad Stevens trusts Jeff Teague with reckless abandon. Plus, we still have our tiny toons guards.  We need another wing to be honest. Semi Ojeleye has actually been very good this season so far but after him and the Jays, it’s pretty barren. Javonte Green is an exciting deep bench guy but he shouldn’t be getting many minutes, we don’t know if Romeo Langford will be able to stay healthy and Nesmith just isn’t ready to contribute yet (he looks fine, just needs to be in the nba system to catch up to the game).  Plus, Danny ainge almost NEVER makes roster adjustments mid-season outside of 10-day contracts."
Does this make Roby Jeff Green?
A skinner Jeff Green
"If he wasnt a top pick and didn't have a bloated contract, he'd basically be viewed as Rudy Gay or Jeff Green. Nice enough role player, can get you some buckets. He'd also have been traded a bunch with every team thinking he'd be their missing offensive piece"
"Jeff Green, while not a superstar he would have random games of playing like a superstar and then have like 6 points the next game"
Remember when there were highly upvoted comments saying he was worse than Jeff Green like 2 weeks ago? I would highly recommend ignoring 90% of this sub.
jeff green deserves better
"Well you can look at the Celtics, if Brown, Ojeleye and Green are out due to safety protocols related to Tatum's positive case.   They'd be looking at Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Jeff Teague, Marcus Smart, Tremont Waters, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall.  That's 6 guards 6'4 and under (4 under 6'1), Theis and Fall.  0-7 waiting to happen in the next two weeks if they're forced to play and Brown, Ojeleye and Green are held out."
He wasn't struggling to get by people last year. He completely cooked Covington and Jeff Green in the playoffs. He was among the top iso players in the league last year

I'm pretty sure he wanted him instead of Jeff Green in the infamous Kendrick Perkins trade. But now? No.
"Durant in his like 3rd year took a OKC team with Jeff Green as his 2nd to 50+ wins.   “Volatile”.  When WB missed half the season, he averaged 34/7/6 on absurd efficiency to carry OKC to the playoffs.   Please stop. KD has been doing this since 2010."
Jeff Green   Draymond Green   Javonte Green   Danny Green   JaMychal Green   Josh Green
lebron &gt; jeff green &gt; god &gt; 0-27 from 3 &gt;  jordan  #CMV
"This Nuggets team needs a ton of help.  Harris / Dozier / Millsap are not up to par right now.  Jamychal Green looks like a good contribution.  Jokic is carrying this team, and the rest of this team needs to step up. The west is not f*cking around this season, and the Nuggets are.  edit/ I said Jeff instead of Jamychal out of anger."
and Jeff Green
Kinda of feel like Rudy is one of those guys that everyone around the NBA loves. Same thing with Jeff Green
"I was thinking I just saw Jeff Green in the last game how is he here on the Nuggets, turns out it's JaMychal Green"
Hey Jeff green was kind of amazing for us last year
lol they lost to a team that has JEFF GREEN starting they deserve all the hate
"Same with: Ben McLemore, Danuel House, Jeff Green"
Fuck what a good 3 by Jeff Green
"Austin rivers, nic Batum, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan whiteside, Marc gasol, demarcus cousins,Harry Giles, and Jeff green are all valuable players on minimum contracts"
"i remember jeff green did this last year in a playoff game.  like really, you're protecting your legendary career playoff 3 point field goal percentage in like the 25th year of your career as a role player when you've already made tons of money?  instead of, you know, trying to win the game?"
Jeff green was one of those versatile wings who you saw the potential to become a do it all wing which is what everybody dreams of. Instead he was just a jack of all trade master of none. What you hoped meant lack of weaknesses for him ended up just meaning a lack of strengths at the nba level which is part of why he didn’t develop   But the prototype athletic wing who in theory shows at times the capability to do everything will always seduce GMs it’s why half the league fell for him at some point   Biggest thing with him was I thought he’d end up being a strong passer akin to a Lamar Odom and it never happened at all at the nba level. Opposite tbh people were worried coming out he didn’t look for his own offense enough opposite ended up being true he had tunnel vision took shots you didn’t want and couldn’t pass
"&gt;Jeff Green another guy had a long career I was sure he was a future All NBA player when he came out  So many role players are like this, top draft picks that never put together the skills to dominate other stars, but always had the skills to help."
What about jeff green
Nets have Jeff Green
Jeff Green starting in 2021 absolutely is
I don’t think he’ll be in the rotation in the playoffs. At least when they play a real team. Probably be Jeff Green/Jarrett Allen/KD all playing the 5
Sheesh how old is Jeff Green now.  Edit: 34. This seems unlikely to be accurate since he’s been in the NBA for 34 years.
Jeff Green was a freaking starter today
"So did Bruce Brown and Jeff Green, all for the first time (including Allen). Don’t think tonight is reflective of anything. That said, Allen should start every night but KD wouldn’t like it"
Or Jeff “Walmart pascal siakam” green
"Jeff ""Maple Jordan"" Green"
I can’t  think of no one except Jeff green of who is the most consistent inconsistent player
Jeff “LeBron James” Green  Or   Jeff “Jeff Green” Green
Is this the same Jeff Green that played with Lebron? Never seen him
Jeff Green is definitely still a thing
Jeez the Jeff Green a still a thing?
Jeff Green is going to be the guy in 30 years that unborn nephews will be scratching their heads to. His career makes no sense on paper
"They could win, depending on which Jeff Green they get"
"I mean. To be fair. Jeff Green is practically a world citizen at this point. Who can keep tabs on that guy? So many one year contracts, and so little time..."
He also said Jeff Green played for the Bucks last year.   He did not.
"Can only speak for the Nets because I don't know the bucks roster that well, but the have kd, kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ, Jeff Green, TLC (luwawu cabbarot, no idea how to spell it lol), Bruce brown and Landry shamet as solid rotation pieces. However u slice it, they have 3 solid players coming off the bench imo. They're real weakness is bigs for defense and rebounding, which they desperately need. With how well they shot this game, it should not have come down to the last possession."
Deandre has been a liability but it’s unfair to throw Perry in there and expect him to do much. We can’t put Jeff Green in against the Bucks and Sixers because Embiid and Giannis will eat which forces us to keep Deandre
"&lt;30% 3PT shooting and game almost won? Against the Nets? With Harden and KD?  I don't hate this score. Disappointed it's not a win but players on the Nets who aren't James Harden/KD got way, way undersold on their performances. Joe Harris and Jeff Green combined for 9-12 from 3. Don't expect that to happen every time."
He was also hiding on Jeff Green the entire 4th quarter.
It's a sweep for Lakers. Jeff Green and Jordan 40 minutes a game is not going to stop Davis and Lebron
"Joe Harris is a sniper too. And they have Spencer back next season as well. Nets are much better than /r/nba is giving them credit. Even this year, I think they have an okay bench with Jeff Green, Shamet, and TLC."
why was giannis guarding jeff green down the stretch
Not likely that Jeff Green and Joe Harris go 9-12 from 3 often
Is Giannis seriously on Jeff Green on D?
When Jeff Green is a better lob target than Deandre Jordan
"Is Lopez post game that bad now, to where they wouldn’t even consider posting him up vs Jeff Green?"
"Fully healed we have a decent bench. Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, TLC."
jeff green was awesome in houston and is awesome on the nets put some respect on uncle
"Man, Jeff Green literally looked like he shouldn't be in the league when he played for the Jazz last season"
"It’s crazy how good Jeff Green can still be, even after an open heart surgery"
"Jeff Green living up to his last name with the way he’s shooting tonight, damn"
Jeff green is literally perfect tonight
Jeff Green said Kyrie who?
Looks like Jeff Green is having his annual nuclear game
Jeff Green game
Jeff green and Harris
Jeff green 5-5 from d town?
of course Jeff Green decides to go Curry mode against us
I missed Jeff  Green
jeff green &gt; steph curry
Damn Jeff Green 5/5
"Even if that’s true, it’s his second game and he’s only passed to like 2 of his teammates before: KD and Jeff Green. Call it an excuse or whatever you want, but it’s also a factual reason as to why he’s been turning the ball over. After the Magic game on Saturday, everyone in the post game thread seemed to agree on that too, since they watched most of the game and it was clear as day that his passes   Part of playmaking is getting to know two major things: the plays and your teammates habits. Harden hasn’t played enough with these guys yet. If this was Curry with some other newly-joined player you’d probably be saying “it’s only been ___ games, let them gel together first”... just saying lol"
Will Joe Harris and Jeff Green continue to go 100% from three? Probably.
Jeff Green and Joe Harris combined 6/6 from 3 in the half. Lets see if they stay hot.
Today I learned Jeff Green was on the bucks last year.
Jeff Green and that Harden connection from the Houston days
Jeff Green keeping the Nets afloat lmao..
I'll never understand how Jeff Green has been tossed around to so many teams. Man is a good ball player. I know obviously he's streaky and doesn't always play like this but I feel he's been a plus on every team but they never keep him
Can we guard Jeff Green at some point?
I swear Jeff Green randomly plays like a superstar every 10 games or so.
"Friendship ended with old nets bench, Jeff green is my new bestie"
Jeff green carrying
oh we got allstar jeff green today
Jeff Green is really going to do this shit
We got GOAT Jeff Green today
Jeff green is shooting 46% from there this yea Romeo
Jeff Green on one tonight
they really let Jeff Green guard Giannis with no help lol good luck
Jeff Green either looks like an All Star or a Journeyman with how he plays sometimes.
Bruce brown and Jeff green aren’t bad
"It’s just Jeff Green, Shamet, and TLC. Wonder who they’ll snag."
Ayo is this the same Jeff Green???
Jeff Green playing the other big four
Jeff Green hitting a 3 off the Harden pass  Just like he used to do in Milwaukee
Joe Harris and Jeff Green are ballers
"After CWebb (I think) fumbled over the word ""league"" in league leader thrice, then I believe Marv said Jeff Green was a one-time Buck and was with them last year? When I clearly remember Uncle Jeff shooting lights out with the Rockets against my Thunder in the playoffs? Had to look it up because I really don't remember Green being a Buck. And he wasn't"
If you mean Jeff green was on the Jazz and Rockets than yeah he was on the bucks last year
"And just said Jeff Green played for the Bucks last year.  Jesus christ, get this senile pervert off television."
"Jeff Green perpetually known as ""The Veteran Jeff Green"""
TIL Jeff Green was a Buck
Bucks legend Jeff Green
"What the fuck is Marv talking about, Jeff Green definitely didn't play on the bucks."
Bucks legend Jeff green
Jeff Green definitely did not play for us last season lol
Jeff Green was on the Bucks????
Jeff Green doesn't even remember him being a buck
Jeff Green was not on the bucks lmao
Jeff Green was not on the bucks last season tf are you talking about
Lol Jeff green literally ignored divencenzo
Does Jeff Green always look like he's has healing bruises from a fight
Finally someone who actually watched us. Jeff green gets talked about like he’s current oubre on this sub.
"cmon, they're not THAT bad.  They still have Joe Harris who is a VERY respectable 3 pt shooter.  Jeff Green, who can give quality minutes here and there (not for long of course)  Shamet and Tyler Johnson who are good role players.  TLC is also a plus defender from what I've seen."
"That's fair, who would be KD's primary defender in your clutch time line up with AD guarding Green?  Also Green pick and rolls, would be more pick and pops, especially with AD's prowess under the rim. It'd be hilarious if we do get a Nets-Lakers Finals and with all the star power there the games are swung by if Jeff Green is feeling himself from the 3 PT line or not."
"Not as much of a mismatch as DJ on AD...  And screens from Jeff Green aren’t going to stop AD, LeBron, or Schröder. They are terrific at fighting through screens."
"I mean even in your 2nd unit, I remember last year is when AD really shone in the playoffs. He shot like 60% from mid range in the playoffs and I feel like that came mostly when Bron went to the bench.  Only 1 game sample, but it looks like Harden is gonna be our 2nd unit guy. He's one of the best floor raisers in the league. I'm a homer so I think our bench isn't as bad as people are saying, but if our 2nd unit is Harden-Brown-Shamet-Harris-Jeff Green, yea we're gonna be obliterated by solid big men, but man that's gonna be a lot of 3's."
Probably Jeff Green or Harden
"Our ending line up would be Kyrie-Harden-Harris-KD-Jeff Green. So in this scenario Trez is probably guarding Green, who'll set the pick then... Or he'll be guarding KD from the start?"
"I think our post defense is rightly criticized as terrible but I think the bench thing isn't completely accurate and honestly sounds a lot like how people criticized the Lakers bench last year.  Our starting line-up fully healthy (physically and mentally) against the Lakers will probably be Kyrie-Harden-KD-Jeff Green-DJ (assuming no more additions to the team). The bench consists of Bruce Brown, Shamet, Joe Harris, TLC, Reggie Perry. Joe Harris is obviously a very good role player, and players like Brown, TLC, and Shamet are actually solid (Shamet started the year terribly, but since some random Nets fan called him bad on Twitter a week ago he's been shooting like 45% from 3). Reggie Perry looks aight in the 2 games so far, but he's a rookie who knows. Also, Harden and KD are some of the best floor raisers in the league. Surround those 2 with just mediocre players, and they draw so much attention it makes those average players look extremely competent."
"I know the average users of this sub and website in general are probably young, but a big part of growing up is just having less time and passion for these kinds of things. 25-year-old GH22 could've never have fathomed the idea that I'd someday just mentally check out on the entire regular season. you get a career going, a mortgage to pay, maybe a couple little future shitposters running around.... the interest just sort of fades.  the nba has and always will be a player's league, which equates to LOTS of movement. whenever I find time now to watch a game, I always see at least one player where I'm like.... shit, _______ plays for who now? when did that happen? (for some reason it's always jeff green)  I'm guessing this author probably experienced something like this tbh"
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
Just what every contender needs   Jeff green getting heavy minutes
"Yes Jeff Green will play a lot but he shouldn’t. And Claxton is described as “more traditional” than Jeff Green, not an old school plugger."
"This was written by someone who clearly doesn’t watch the Nets lol.   Jeff green will be over 25 mpg all year, and nic Claxton being described as a traditional big man is just dumb"
"TLC is pretty solid for a a backup, hes shooting 37% from three and shot 39% last year. Shamet is a proven 3pt shooter and bruce brown again is another solid bench guy, hes shooting 57% from the field so far and is a legitimately good defender who locked up mitchell and jamal murray. Jeff green is a decent role player, hes shooting 45% from 3 and has decent size. He thrived last year with harden.  Its just our bigs are horrendous. we're gonna rely on claxton/perry to step up which is asking a lot. DJ is one of the worst players in the league right now. we just have zero bigs."
"Solid write-up and solid recommendations on players to target.  I wouldn't be surprised if a Dinwiddie trade does happen for some more frontcourt depth. I'm in the minority here, but I'm kinda high on Bruce Brown as a perimeter stopper.  There's definitely a major need for some frontcourt depth though; Jeff Green had a resurgence in Houston last season but some more bigs are needed. Opposing teams will feast on DAJ in the playoffs."
"Jeff Green is going to play a lot.  He and Harden had incredible chemistry last year as a small ball 5, but he can obviously play the 4, too.  He is in great shape and I would certainly pencil him in for more than 12mpg... He can do at least 20 and provide great production in them.  I'm convinced he signed there because Harden told him he was going to end up there, too.  Expect that connection to continue to grow."
"When Draymond was in, KD was playing the 4 anyways so he wasn’t really a small ball 5. Also he’ll play small ball 5 in opportune times for a few minutes. Not for super long stretches. In the playoffs rotations tighten which means less minutes for guys like DJ and Reggie Perry and more for the stars and Jeff Green."
One of these days Jeff Green will take off
"Have this image of Kyrie not being there for tip, Nash looking down to the bench, pointing to Jeff Green who starts heading out before Nash stops him to hand off the clipboard, and rips off his tear away suit to go run the point"
"I disagree wholeheartedly with this. Shot selection factors into whether you are a good player or not. But if Trae Young is more likely to make every jumpshot on the floor than, say, Jeff Green, he is a better shooter than Jeff Green even if Green's shot selection is better"
Jeff Green
"I quickly want to question their depth, but if healthy, they're fine. The wing defense will be the main question but a supporting cast around those main 3 of DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and (when healthy) Spencer Dinwiddie isn't that bad. Fit wise it is a bit weird though"
"Let's also not forget that our depth before the Harden trade and Dinwiddie injury was by far the best in the league. After, we still have some depth. Joe Harris is lethal, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown are productive on offense and valuable defenders, Landry Shamet hasn't been great so far but can shoot the lights out at times, and Nic Claxton will be getting minutes when he gets healthy and I'm fairly certain he will be surprising a lot of people with his play."
"I don’t like watching players who make their teams worse.  Period.  Kyrie, Trae Young, Jeff Green, etc."
"Last year the best ones were Marvin Williams, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris, Jeff Green, and MKG. 2019 was the best I can remember in recent years, Wes Matthews, Wayne Ellington, Enes Kanter, Jeremy Lin, Carmelo.  Realistic ones I can think of this year are Robin Lopez again and maybe Aron Baynes? If the Raptors continue to struggle"
Will anyone they sign play over deandre or Jeff green though?
"Lebron, Wade, and Chris bosh played with an old Ray Allen, an old Birdman, an old Shane Battier, and Mario Chalmers.  &amp;#x200B;  Joe Harris is better than all of those players, they have Dinwiddie next year, and Jeff Green/Tyler Johnson/Bruce Brown/Shamet/TLC are all fine, too, right?  &amp;#x200B;  I've never understood why people are so worried about BK's depth."
"No one is guarding Embiid, Giannis or AD.  Jarrett Allen wasn't.  Taurean Prince wasn't.  Jeff Green at the 5 gives the Nets the most switchable lineup.  There is going to mismatch no matter what, but determinations have to be made.  I'm sure the Nets would rather have AD than Harden or Kyrie but they can't get him.    BTW I like Bam, but offensively he is not in the same conversation as the other three."
"Bruh Jeff Green its the new PJ Tucker, cant see him really guarding Embiid Giannis Bam AD etc on crunch time, theres no way thats a missmatch every time on the floor"
all im asking is how tf this dude jeff green still not getting paid lol
right that’s not the issue for me durant can hold lebron well enough i guess. there’s just not a single person who can even bother AD on your team atm. maybe durant with his length but then lebron goes off. Jeff Green and Prince is BBQ chicken for either bron or ad.
"Oh man, you are in the Jeff Green infatuation state. Sorry for what’s to come brother."
"Jeff Green is a nets too, OKC 2.0"
"I swear when the Bucks played the Nets, Giannis guarded Harden and KD for less than 60 seconds the whole game, he spent the entire game guarding Jeff Green on the wing while KD and Harden were shitting on them"
"Not really into favorites, but I do have players that I like to watch all around, besides the obvious ones I'd say Jordan Clarkson, Jaylen Brown, Draymond, Jeff Green, Jeremi Grant  From the new players I liked Quickley a lot and also Cole Anthony since their games against the Cavs."
"Jeff Green, the franchise"
"&gt; Jeff Green hasn't been useful in two years.  You haven't been paying attention then. He was very useful for Houston last year, and has been pretty solid for Brooklyn. He's not a game changer, but is a solid backup."
"&gt; Jeff Green hasn't been useful in two years.  Jeff Green was literally awesome with Houston last year for a guy on a vet min, what are you talking about?"
"It's really not an exaggeration. You're overvaluing those guys. Jeff Green hasn't been useful in two years. TLC sucks. Shamet isn't shooting like he was.   Bruce Brown I kind of like, but he was honestly just getting big minutes at the end of the season last year with Detroit because they were trying to lose."
That is an over exaggeration. Brown and Shamet were both starters last year and can be solid 7th and 8th guys. Jeff Green is a valuable back up PF. TLC is fine for regular season minutes. Then Dinwiddie is injured. They are extremely lacking in Cebter position but they're bench is far from shit. It's as good as the Cavs bench was when LeBron was playing with Kyrie and Love
He just did this last night lmao. Cavs scored a bucket and he looked up at the clock multiple times leading up to the inbound. Got the ball and passed it to jeff green even though there was like 1.7 seconds left
Why not the nets? Harden/KD/Jeff Green all have deep OKC ties
The Jeff Green Trade. That was the beginning of the end of the Grit and Grind Era
Old ass Jeff Green played 45 minutes lol
"I mean, yeah, but that’s the thing. They can get a big body for essentially nothing. They have 1 playable center on their roster, it can not hurt them to just bring a guy in and try it out. Maybe one of these guys gets a new wave of energy playing with these guys. Worst case, they suck and you waive them. But for going against someone like Embiid in the playoffs could really hurt them without another big body. I’m not suggesting any of those guys are Embiid stoppers, but there’s a significant difference between at least putting a center sized player on Embiid and Jeff Green being your backup 5 on him. I just don’t personally see a better route for Brooklyn to get another center."
"Yeah, also I wouldn't do that if I were Nash (or KD). But w/ no Allen, he's basically been the help rim defender while DeAndre or Jeff Green play as the ""5"" (basically absorb the body blows lol). Similar to what he did with us, except DeAndre/Jeff Green are not Draymond."
"It'll be DeAndre until he gets cooked so bad and/or fouls out. Then Jeff Green b/c they don't want Durant to die, even though he's realistically been playing the 5 or help defense for the ""5""."
Love your flair! Man carried us past Boston in that ECF alongside Bron. Crazy that Jeff Green was Cleveland’s second best player during stretches of our 2018 Finals run.
"They need better role players but to be fair KD+Harden+deep team would probably work better than KD+Harden+Kyrie, they have no one outside of Harris and are playing Jeff Green 40+ minutes as a starter."
"I agree, but I also expect/hope Kyrie starts facilitating a bit more. That's the stark difference between James and Kyrie.  Harden isolates and creates for himself *and* others *and* he will find the others.  Kyrie does that too, but he just doesn't find the others as often as he should, in my opinion.  I'd rather have Jeff Green take the wide open 3 over a Kyrie contested midrange pullup most of the time, but I'm about 80% sure if Kyrie makes that decision, he's taking the shot.  James would almost definitely pass the ball to Green."
"Dude, Lebron on the Grizzlies would have been nuts. Defensively they could lockdown whoever they wanted. Shooting wise, Mike Miller came to the Grizz that year, and LeGM would have had Chris Wallace trade for shooters and not Jeff Green. I wished for this so much back then when he left Miami, but I knew it wouldn’t happen."
2008 All NBA rookie first teamer Jeff Green played 48 minutes
"I liked how the Nets were using Harden as the primary ballhander and running screens at him with KD and Kyrie.  Harden did have a few times where he would over dribble and force Joe Harris or Jeff Green into a terrible shot with 2-3 seconds left on the clock.  This offense does look like it could be unstoppable if Harden can speed up some.  Kyrie was gassed in second OT, every shot was hitting the front of the rim.  Sexton looked like the only one with something left in the tank, I think this is the second time I've ever seen him play and that double OT was pretty impressive.  Also, Richard Jefferson is a Cwebb level commentator.  I never really watched Nets games on YES! network much before this  season, but he commentates like a homer who pretends he isn't a homer."
"The *only* problem that I have with Kyrie getting the ball over James is that Kyrie is almost certainly going to take the shot regardless of situation.  James might take the shot, but we also saw him find Jeff Green wide open for a 3 shortly before the end of regulation.  I really don't mind isolations, but I don't like that Kyrie doesn't seem very willing to pass out of them for a guy his size.  He's good enough to create shots for other people out of isolations, he just doesn't like to give the ball up much."
Canadian Jeff Green.
"Sleeping big time on TLC, and Jeff Green as well. But yes I agree we need a buyout depth piece badly."
"The King just got a game off of the Durant super team. Kyrie also put up some monster numbers as the number 2 scorer on his team! Kevin Love, Dellavedova, Jeff Green, Cedi Osman, and Larry Nance were there as support as well."
"Jeff green, shame he ended up joining KDs new superteam"
They’ll pick someone up in the buyout. By the way has anyone noticed Jeff Green is shooting 59% from the field? That seems unsustainable from a career 44% shooter.
"KD passes it to Harden  Harden dribbles for 5 seconds, steps back, jukes, drives, dishes it to Irving.  6 seconds left on the clock.  Irving catches the pass, put the ball on the floor, drives to the hoop. Dishes it to Jeff Green.  Harris sets a screen for Jeff, Jeff turns his body.  2 seconds on the clock. Green shoots.   Clank, off the rim.  KD 42/9/4  Harden 30/11/12  Irving 36/5/6  Kevin pats Jeff Green on the top of his head. ""It's ok little fella""  Nets lose 142 to 118"
Who are they going to have on Embiid? Jeff Green? Good luck Brooklyn
"harden, durant, kyrie, deandre jordan and jeff green to me are better than lakers lineaup considering lebrons age even tho hes still great"
Minutes going into 2nd overtime:  KD:  45   Harden:  45   Kyrie:  43   Jeff Green:  40
"claxton, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown"
"""Jeff Green with a butt naked shot""   a what?!"
As everyone predicted Jeff Green hits the 3 to take the lead in OT
Jeff Green may have called game.
Wtf is this game. Jeff green LOL.
Renowned NBA sharpshooters Larry Nance and Jeff Green
Jeff Vino Green
"""The Jeff Green/Larry Nance show just like we thought""  RJ is fucking hilarious"
Jeff Green best shooter in the league
JEFF GREEN  How tf has he somehow found himself playing closer to his actual potential in the past 1-2 years than his entire career???
"""The Jeff Green vs Larry Nance showdown as we all expected"" - Richard Jefferson is great to listen to on the Nets broadcast."
Fucking Jeff Green
Jeff Green to the rescuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
"Jeff Green taking the key shot, naturally"
"as we all predicted, jeff green with the go ahead clutch trey"
Jeff Green ft. 3 overpaid scrubs!
God damn it Jeff Green. Pain
I need Cedi to talk some smack with Uncle Jeff Green
Jeff Green is one of those players who pisses you off when he’s on the other team and pisses you off even more when he’s on your team.
the rockets already tried this Jeff Green at center stuff bro
"Jeff Green bent over on all fours, in pain   *DeAndre Jordan slaps his ass*"
Jeff Green shooting form looks like Karl Malone
Has Jeff Green missed as a Net?
Jeff green was a ridiculous pickup for these guys
"&gt; Passed to Jeff Green instead  ""You up Jeff, i'm 4-9 rn!"""
Kd just did this to end the half. Lmao. Passed to Jeff Green instead
Jeff Green is on this team too?? 2012 OKC rejoice
Jeff Green is more than serviceable as well. Easy with the overreactions. I did that mistake too. The team has not even played 1 game together.
"Joe Harris, Jeff Green are good  TLC, Shamet, DJ are *serviceable*"
lmao cavs really doubled jeff green in the P&amp;R
Why did we give Deandre his contract when it could've went to the  Jeff Green
if jeff green can continure shooting 40%+ from three the league is fucked
Jeff Green is underrated af
Jeff Green is playing like 10 years younger in this offense.
How is Jeff green always on a contending team every year
yo jeff green is lowkey nasty on 3s now.
"Garland is out so just Sexton coming back, sad.  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (6-7) | [](/BKN)Nets (9-6) ---|--- C.

Jeff green not harris
There should be a Jeff Green tribute video instead tbh
"Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant are from/raised in Maryland. Carmelo was here from 8 years old through high school and Kevin was pretty much all his life until college.  Edit I'm dumb. Born != From. Fun fact Micheal Beasley, Jeff Green, Markell Fultz, and Chase Young are from Maryland too, the same county !"
"It's true, at this point it would be Jeff Green guarding AD most of the game"
So a more expensive but worse version of Jeff green.
Yeah  I mean is it wrong though. Much better than before the trade when Jeff Green was the sub of the game with 3 points once
You can't stop them.   All you can do is slow them down and make them take tough shots. Hopefully they miss or are forced to defer to Jeff Green or a bench player. That's it.   Nothing else you can do.
Zeke’s teammates  - Joe Dumars  - Mark Aguirre - Bill Lambieer - Vinnie Johnson  - Best offense: +3.0  Mark Price’s Teammates  - Bead Daughtery - Larry Nance - Craig Ehlo  - Best Offense: +5.7  Kevin Johnson’s Best Teammates Pre-Barkley  - Tom Chambers - Jeff Hornacek - Armen Gilliam (?)  Best Offense: +5.3  Magic’s Teammates in 1989  - James Worthy - Byron Scott - A.C Green  Offense: +6.0  The offensive numbers I’m providing are how much better their ORTG was compared to league average btw (on bball ref)
I think it may be a more even split between Harden and Kyrie with James looking to facilitate more and provide open looks for the rest of the squad. Wouldn't be surprised if Jeff Green blows up and takes over at the 5 when they play smaller teams.
"I don't think the Nets bench is literal trash. Because A) that's not how ""literal"" works and B) they're not good, but definitely servicable. Shamet/Luwawu-Cabarrot/Jeff Green is okay and by the playoffs maybe Dinwiddie is back."
“Wow and Embiid goes right through jeff green in the post to give him 45 on the night...it is Sixers 94 Nets 120“
"Embiid can be a problem for them, but then again Embiid playing drop coverage against Kyrie and KD is a way bigger problem.  They start two 6'11 guys + Harden who plays big for his position, Jeff Green is pretty big when he's at the 4 too.  They are probably bigger than the Celtics overall actually"
How I feel about Jeff Green right now
"When I hear the name Jeff Green, I think of ""The Bum Bum Song."". Which after googling this morning, I realized is actually TOM Green.  So yea, Tom Green plays for the Brooklyn Nets."
"Jeff green did, joe Harris had an above average night. You’re talking like it was an aberration from a bench guy"
Didn’t say anything about Jeff green but Harris is a career 43% shooter from 3 and this year he has KD and Harden on the floor with him so I would expect to have games where he shoots 5/7 from 3.
"He is an elite shooter but him and Jeff Green couldn't miss lol They don't typical not miss a shot, correct?"
"Bucks:  PG: Jrue / Augustin  SG: DiVincenzo / Forbes  SF: Middleton / Connaughton   PF: Giannis / Torrey Craig  C: Lopez / Portis   Nets:  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown  SG: Harden / Shamet  SF: Joe Harris / TLC  PF: KD / Jeff Green  C: DAJ / Claxton   Am I the only one who doesn't think that their benches are that terrible? I think both teams are in desperate need of a proper backup center, but if you wanted to reduce each team down to an 8-man rotation you could do that with ease.   I will admit though that I am kinda worried about the Bucks bench guys on the defense end; Augustin is a solid backup floor general but is undersized. Forbes and Portis have been known to be black holes on defense.  I get what you're saying about the weaknesses in both of their rotations but I'm decently high on the guys. Obviously the talent is top heavy but they aren't scrubs by any means."
"Well, if Westbrook was Jeff Green, sure."
Both solid points honestly. Jeff green and Joe Harris did shoot out of there minds though.
Nobody is able to create their shots except Harden or KD. If you are actually good though like Jeff Green or Joe Harris people will actively look for you to hold the rock because they trust you to improvise. The other players need to stick to roles or else offense will be a mess.
Jeff Green playing next to Harden and KD under Nash and MDA are gonna look a lot better than any version of Jeff Green in recent years
I don’t think so. Harden was trying to get DJ looks. Getting Jeff Green looks. Obviously Joe. Just seems much more fluid and they haven’t even practiced. The energy is night and day to me compared to some of those Kyrie games.
"'12-'13 Celtics \~ Garnett, Pierce, Jeff Green"
"'17-'18 Cavs ~ LeBron, Cedi, Jeff Green"
I dont he will be much of a threat in potential matchup at least an offensive threat and any moment he will leave jeff green harden can find him
"Rudy Goobert will be exposed in the playoffs yet again, doesn't matter if it's agains 6'8 Jeff Green"
"Just need a center that can defend and we are gucci. Not like we can’t win with the current roster, but Jordan is basically useless, against bigs that can shoot he’s just a huge negative because he never steps out to defend them. His post defense isn’t anything good either anymore. Legit look better with Jeff Green playing at 5 because while he can’t handle bigs either defensively, he’ll at least space the floor and hit his shots."
to be fair it was Vogels fault for putting him in against DJ instead of Jeff Green
"This was the biggest thing from the Harden trade imo. He's going to get other guys involved so much better than KD and Kyrie will, and Jeff Green or Joe Harris randomly showing up and dropping 20 makes Brooklyn a lot more dangerous"
Im glad Jeff Green went to a good situation. Still bummed he didn't work out for the Jazz
Deandre is complete ass but he can defend in the paint a little if he really trys. Uncle Jeff is decent at the 5 and we just signed Roberson who could be a major blessing although he may be completely washed defensively by now. Even if Embiid has 40 a night with curry and green being streaky his only other real reliable scorer this season is Harris. Simmons isn’t a scoring threat. It’ll be extremely hard for the sixers to out score us in a 7 games series with harden KD and kyrie especially with how well they work together and as we’ve seen literally any one of them can drop 40 when it’s needed. Not to mention this is the regular season. I guarantee you KD goes even more god mode in the playoffs
Lebron always does crazy shit like this against Jeff Green. It goes way back
imagine if the lakers closed out on Joe Harris as hard as they close out on Jeff Green
Yeah but on the other side deandre and jeff green are guarding him
EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. Harden does that play with Jeff Green. An I swear every time it works. Amazing. It's silly at this point.
He is still big and 7 feet tall he should be able to score on Jeff Green in the post IMO. He should at least try a little jump hook he basically fades for a jumper every time
lmfao did reggie seriously say jeff green can play 1-5? the fuck is he smoking  imagine jeff green running the point
"I mean, who else is going to guard him in that lineup? He might be one of the better options. It's not like Jeff Green is a lockdown defender."
"that is terrible ""help"" defense by Jeff green"
Now Jeff green fucking watching. The fuck these guys doing.
What is jeff green doing?
"Nets are starting Bruce Brown and Jeff Green, if the Lakers can’t pummel these scrubs they should be ashamed...even without AD and DS. This should be a blowout."
Jeff Green the goat
"Jeff Green is technically bigger than PJ Tucker, who was sometimes the biggest guy on the Rockets lineups last year"
"Yes, Bruce brown, Jeff green and Landry shamet are all playing"
It’s gonna be a 23 threes made by the nets night and Jeff green gonna have a career night
Context meaning that he hasn't played the amount of games Harden or Beal have to solidify their cases and that Kyrie is playing with 2 other all NBA players so of course he's gonna put up good stats (especially since that Nets team has no other scorers besides them and Jeff Green I guess so they rely on those 3 to put 30+ each night).
"No rim protection + no really backup C besides Jeff Green ig, I hope Trezz takes advantage lol and Dennis who struggles"
"And??? They still were better constructed with the nets are now. If we had Lowry, Powell, FVV, Siakim, Ibaka and gasol as role players instead of Deandre Jordan, TLC, Jeff green, Tyler freaking Johnson and Bruce brown. We’d be the indisputable favorites lmaoooo.   In 2019 harden lost to the warriors in the second round. Same way he’s lose to the bucks/Sixers.  And then you say kawhi wasn’t the real FMVP.... yea this convo over lmaoo convo done"
Jeff Green could average 35 being defended by kevin love
"But they can make a wall, DJ in the middle, Harden on the left, Jeff Green on the right, Kyrie riding on top of DJ. How is Giannis gonna get through this?"
Not with Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan guarding Giannis
I love the trademark Jeff Green 35 point explosion that happens once a season. He sneaky good.
"Because the team when you're first hired isn't your team. It's the previous GM's team.   He tore down a very mediocre team with basically no young talent besides Pierce...bottomed out and got the assets to get KG and Ray. Won a title. It was just bad lottery luck that gave them the Jeff Green pick that was eventually traded for Ray...they could have had KD.  He hired two good coaches...and *traded* the first one for an asset. He has bucked consensus in the draft, and done well. You can say some of it is luck, and that he hasn't been aggressive enough at times, or whatever... but he's certainly *competent.*"
"Jeff Teague, Wannamaker, Blake Griffin, Draymond Green, Aaron Baynes."
People love to clown on jeff green but everytime I watch him play hes balling the fuck out. My eye test says he's shooting like 60% from 3.
For some reason I always felt like Jeff Green is like 40
"Jeff Green was my dads next door neighbor in a swanky apt in Boston while he was there. My dad said he was a really nice kid and started following the Celtics so they could chat about games in the elevator. I’ve rooted for him since then. Funny story, when Green got traded, the Gronk moved into that apt and was, how do you say, less of a good neighbor..."
"Perkins and Robinson were traded for Jeff Green, so they wouldn't be on the same team together."

Shoutout to Jeff Green for being absurdly good for us at the end of last year.
"Wait, so is getting cuckolded by August Alsina. KD or Jeff Green?"
Can confirm Jeff Green is treated as a disposable trade slut. He's underappreciated and it bothers me.
&gt; Imagine if Reggie Miller forced his way to the Jazz in the mid-90s. They would have stomped the Bulls in the late 90s Finals.  Great example because well you have with the Jazz:  * Stockton -- Drafted in 1984 by the Jazz  * Malone -- Drafted in 1985 by the Jazz  * Coach Sloan -- Assistant starting in 1985 then made HC in 1988 after his first coaching(Assistant and HC) at the Bulls   * Bryon Russell -- Drafted in 1993 by the Jazz  * Jeff Hornacek -- Traded to the Jazz by the 76ers in the middle of the 1993-1994 season for Jeff Malone and a 1994 1st rounder and the Jazz got some others(Sean Green and 1995 Second Rounder who was   * Greg Ostertag -- Drafted in 1995 by the Jazz  That is the starting 5 and Coach basically being built within the Jazz organization. No Free Agents in that. No building of Mega Teams and what happen? 0 Titles. If they don't do the Hornacek trade and play the FA game and get Miller then I bet they win some. And oddly enough I doubt I would have been a Jazz fan in that alternate world.
"Jeff Green has played with KD twice, Harden 3 times, Russ twice, with Lebron once and the big 3 Celtics as well. What a Crazy career."
"I didn’t know Jeff Green was a SuperSonic, haha that just made him nostalgic asf 😂"
"And since 2011, KD won 2 titles and Jeff Green set an NBA record with being on 37 teams in 10 seasons."
"There are 4 teams right now who are ahead of mavs record breaking offense last year. And its actually not looking like a fluke at this point. Teams are just scoring at ridiculous rate. For example every one of brooklyns main 5 players, Jeff green Joe Harris kyrie kd and harden are all shooting 50% and 40% from three. Nets have 7 players with above a 61% true shooting, their team average for true shooting is 62%. And the clippers and bucks have similar numbers just citing the nets because I know it off hand. There has been an offensive explosion at the top end"
Jeff Green too. Harden has been dishing dimes to both of them and both are cashing in.
"No shit idiot. My comment was clearly OT. Y’all streak got broken by Harden, Joe Harris, Jeff green and some bums who didn’t care in the first half 🤣🤣🤣"
Yeah that was a terrible call in the first place. Also to everyone complaining about Jeff Green stealing the tip...that happens all the damn time and it's rarely called.
"Maybe ur right but I still think the point stands that they would prefer to let Jeff green drop 50 than losing to Durant, harden and kyrie  It also wouldn’t be fair if u just put them into today’s game because how different it is so I’m assuming they get some time to practice and get used to the new game"
"This isn't that unexpected from Jeff Green, he's been great as a small ball 5"
the 2 he didn't score or assist on he screened for Jeff Green to get an open layup lol
Yup I'm just talking about the initiation and making the right reads. Those guys couldn't miss. The offensive plays for the Nets in the last 5 minutes were:   Jeff Green 3pt (Harden assist)  Joe Harris 3pt (Harden assist)  Harden floater  Jeff Green 3pt (Harden assist)  Harden layup  Jeff Green layup off screen from Harden  Harden 3pt  Harden 2 free throws (take foul)
shouldnt he be rooting for the nets? seeing as they have the last 2 players to ever play for the sonics (kd and jeff green)
How is Jeff Green still on a minimum?
Can we all agree that Jeff Green is the LeBron James of role players
"Jeff Green and Harden were screening each other like crazy to force the switch, like a few plays they were doing it for a solid 5 seconds until Phoenix had to give it up"
"&gt;Curry’s showing this season that he can carry a team with no other All NBA guys to a respectable level.  Did Draymond die? Also Wiggins is playing at an All-Defensive level, and Oubre's a good defender too. Just because they don't score a lot doesn't mean they're garbage, such a bad take.  Curry has more help than Harden tonight and Harden showed why he's better. Curry on this Nets team with no defense behind him is nowhere near the same team with Harden on them, they're getting 150 scored on them legit everynight with the corpse of DJ and Jeff Green being the only decent defenders."
And the Jeff Green 2 was technically a screen assist from Harden LMAO
"they tried to avoid the switch, but then jeff green blew by ayton. Monty should've just benched ayton."
"Ain’t no stopping Jeff Green either, apparently"
"&gt; Suns allowed themselves to get cooked by Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green  Eh, not really. Harden is just that good at getting almost anyone a good look."
I have no clue why teams do not lock down a long term contract for Jeff Green. The Nets are his 10th team.
"He looked at that fourth quarter lineup of Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and Tyler Johnson and thought, ""Huh, this feels familiar..."""
Does anyone know whether the Jeff Green move at the end of the game is legal? Seems like it would happen all the time in jump balls if it were legal but also I’ve never heard of a rule that states you have to high point the ball
"Nah, no one gives Jeff green the respect he deserves."
"Everyone outside of Joe Harris on that team is a low-tier player. You give up 57 points to Meth Curry, Jeff Green, Shamet, and Cabarrot and you have to be looking at your effort.  And I would know what bad defense looks like as a Kings fan."

"Harden was obviously the main guy, but don’t forget Joey Buckets and Jeff Green."
"This team just shot 57% from the field and 50% from 3, without KD and Kyrie... That's INSANE!   The next best players after Harden are Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet... LMAOOO   This team's offensive ability might go down in history as an all-time best"
"That's understandable, but Jeff Green, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson killed them too"
Can we talk about Jeff Green winning a jump ball on Ayton to give Harden that last shot lol
"#UNCLE JEFF GREEN, EVERYBODY"
Is it just me but does Jeff Green look bouncier and more fresh then he did like 4 years ago lol?
Jeff Green casually turning back the clock too.
"And Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green both had nice games too. Harden made big shots down the stretch and was great in the first half, but this game wasn't a one-man show from what I can tell"
Im so irrationally happy for Jeff Green. And that Shamet  D on Book was textbook.
Jeff Green at the 5 is a cheat code
Ayton is soft. Jeff Green worked him
Harden and Jeff green came in clutch
Shout out to uncle Jeff Green
"I cannot believe we just won this game. So proud of this squad.  Harden was incredible as usual, but Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green and Landry Shamet stepped up big time. 26 point comeback. Amazing."
34 year old Jeff Green won a clutch tip-off against Deandre Ayton. That was the ball game.
Jeff Green was the best center this game
ayton 7foot tall and lost a jump ball to jeff green and then immediately gives up a layup to jeff green  some tingus pingus type of shit
Jeff Green is my dad
Jeff Green has been a better center than both DJ and Ayton tonight lmao
they actually letting shamet and jeff green look like some all nba defenders lmaooooooooooooooooooooo
Sun's are so scared of Harden iso on Deandre Ayton they double him and give Jeff Green a pretty wide open layup. Joe Harris hustle closeout leads to a miss. Harden comes down and nails a 3. Nets first lead of the game. I ain't even a Nets fan but games like this are why you watch basketball.
Jeff Green got hops lol
How the fuck did Jeff Green get that tip over Ayton?
Jeff green you beautiful man.
Still crazy how Jeff Green was the second best player on a finals team
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"Westbrook ate Kyrie alive that game. Man had a point to prove. He was hitting his signature bank mid ranger all game more than relying on his athleticism, and from the Wizards game I've caught so far it seems like he's doing that far more than usual, which is maybe why he has so many off nights when his shots not on.  Yea I dunno what to tell you. I watch every Nets game, the difference when we have a 7 footer who can help rebound and plays a semblance of help defense, which are two things we lack deeply, and when we don't is very apparent. Especially considering the Nets defense is to switch everything. KD's impact on a good defensive team might be overstated, like that bogus DPOY campaign when he was on the Warriors, but on a bad defensive team, yea we need him a lot, and just because the Wizards went off on us doesn't mean KD's impact is overstated imo.  Well at least up until the Pistons loss we really needed him, which is when Jeff Green apparently had a serious talk with the team, and the team actually now tries a tad on the defensive end, not lock down or anything, but just enough where we get stops to allow our overpowered offense to get a double digit lead, then we coast again lol."
I swear teams fall for that behind the back bounce pass to Jeff Green 5x a game
"What's crZy is he doesn't assist them that much it seems like more that teams just cannot help at all off them. He has most of his assists to Joe Harris and Jeff green right now, the two other members of the nets best lineup."
"It's so crazy, like all he does off of a Jeff Green pick is take a couple of steps forward(not even quick steps) and all of the sudden Green is just wide open behind the three point line because both defenders are following Harden.  Then Harden makes this nonchalant behind the back pass bounce pass to Green for a wide open 3.  The reads for him just seem so easy"
It was Jeff Green like two weeks before the Exum/JC trade.
The Harden to Jeff Green connection is cash money
"Jeff ""GOAT"" Green"
Ah the yearly Jeff Green poster. Beautiful.
Jeff Green looking at Blake like “you ain’t taking none of my minutes!”
"Nets real big 3 is Kyrie, Harden, and Jeff Green"
Jeff Green is arguably the most inconsistent player of all time
Who knew the only thing that Jeff green needed to be consistent is james harden
Jeff Green is easily one of the greatest role players of all time given his consistency
Jeff green kills us  every game
Jeff Green is actually amazing
it's the Jeff Green show
Jeff Green always looks so good when I watch him wtf
Im only here for Jeff Green highlight.
Jeff green has to be one of the most underpaid players in the league year to year. He shouldn't be making the minimum. He gotta fire his agent
I stand by that Jeff Green shoulda been in this year's dunk contest. He's had some serious jams this year
Jeff Green???
I think Jeff Green is actually somewhat close or was.
*Jeff Green*  Lol
Jeff Green has been great this year wtf this bot smoking
"Lebron is almost as good as Jeff Green in that regard. it's easy to ""find his way onto a contender"" when he can just carry the team."
Uncle Jeff Green
"Death, taxes and Jeff green finding his way onto a contender every year"
"Do you consider Bruce brown, DAJ, Shamet, Claxton, Jeff Green to be starting caliber on a contending team?"
"For the Nuggets and Knicks, Carmelo shot 41.7% from the field, 43.5% inside the arc, 32.0% from 3, and had a 44.2% eFG across 66 playoff games.  Against the Lakers, he literally had one great game (2009 WCF, G1) and in the other nine games against them in the '08 and '09 playoffs he shot 66-186 (35.4%).  Toe to toe with Kobe? He had two excellent series in '09 to get his team to the conference finals and then had one great game there out of six.  The other 17 seasons of his career feature one series win, which he closed out by shooting 30.5% over the final three games against a #7 Celtics team whose leading scorer in the series was Jeff Green.  He was inefficient as hell as a playoff scorer."
Possibly with kd joining in. Blake isn't going to be a big factor and if he isn't working when it matters we have Jeff green or b brown. I don't really see it happening though this team we are Fielding rn is closing games well and we have the playmakers that the clippers didnt. Also I feel like last season we heard so much about clippers players being annoyed by their superstars and the opposite is coming from the nets role players.
Jeff Green is the likely small ball 5. Brown and Griffin can't shoot and we'd be absurdly small with Shamet out there.
"Yeah if you start small you can put him on DJ and still let him operate as he does. But Bud isnt going to do that. And if you roll out their regular lineup there's nobody else they can put Brook on. Whenever Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, TLC, Claxton any of those guys are in the game though that's whom they are putting Giannis on"
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
Yeah you’re not gonna win by doubling off Harris. You need to double off Jeff green or Bruce brown. You can’t seriously tel me the game plan is to double a 50% 3pt shooter and a 40% career 3pt shooter
Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are going to be more impactful than Blake
Jeff Green or Bruce Brown easily
"&gt;Durant - 29/7.3/5.3 on 65.2%TS (5.4 BPM)  Durant has played 18 games this season. James Harden has played more games as a Net than Kevin Durant.  &gt;Harden also has Harris who is averaging 15ppg on 70%TS and shooting the three at a 50% clip  I mean, you can look at the stats of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson before and after the Harden trade. All of those players have had an insane jump in offensive production. In fact, Nick Claxton has more than doubled his production with only 3 additional minutes played compared to last season.   Everyone thought the Nets depleted their depth for Harden but anyone who watches the game can see Harden is getting the most out of everyone. Guys that were 3rd string are now quality contributors. That's a pretty clear definition of an MVP."
Yeah but we’ve been missing guys all year. What I look at is he’s consistently put guys like Bruce brown and Jeff green in positions to succeed even in unconventional ways. He’s been pretty good
"Giannis boutta put up prime Wilt numbers against DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, and Blake"
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"bro jr, Jeff Green, dajuan summers and Hibbert was such a tough team. they had so many big bodies who would just overpower you    fuck i miss the Big East"
Kyrie Morris and JT were all good friends. Kyrie didn't get along with Rozier and Brown from what was apparent. Ofc you can't know for sure  Also I think the guys just didn't fit together as a team. Everyone had to sacrifice and noone was lifted up. Look at Brooklyn and see how Bruce brown Jeff green and Joe Harris benefit from the stars. They play better than they would without them. With the Boston team they were all so good that they're all putting up great numbers this year but did not fit together at all. If Hayward was healthy a lot of those issues wouldn't have mattered because we would not lose as much and the fit would be better with an additional playmaker but he was recovering.
"Counter argument: they’re the team to root for because of the power of friendships: KD and Jeff Green go way back to Sonics days, Harden KD Jeff Green OKC days, Blake Deandre Lob City, Nash Amare MDA Suns coaching staff, KD Kyrie Deandre the 3 musketeers that signed with the Nets to make it all happen. And the rewarding underdog/ feels good stories for guys like Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, come back story for Blake"
Can Blake griffin really help this team? As bill simmons asked: “is Blake better than Jeff green?”
"Landry Shamet, Meth Curry, Bruce Brown and Jeff Green like Voltron  right now providing the offense that KD will provide when he returns. Ridiculous."
Nets: sign Blake  Jeff green: that’s all I needed
Jeff green might be the only 34 year old who looks and plays exactly like the guy he was 10 years ago with no change
That Robert Williams foul bailing out Jeff green when he does Jeff green type things is exactly the type of thing that keeps his minutes down more than people want. Like just textbook exactly the type of thing to do to piss a coach off
He would guard Jeff Green
Get a bunch of rebounds and play good defense until he inevitably has to be taken off the court due to Kyrie/Harden/KD relentlessly attacking him.   Jeff Green as their small ball center would drag him out of the paint and make him pretty ineffective.
"A large tier below.  He had many other flaws like poor passing instincts, poor defensive intincts and ball hoggery.   I love all four of the other top 5 guys.  Suggs, cunningham are surefire perennial allstars.  Mobley and Green might be too.  Kuminga reminds me of young Jeff Green with a worse jumpshot."
"It’s easy to check. Harris is basically the equivalent of Gordon. Jeff Green is producing like Ariza was. DJ and Claxton are giving you similar numbers to Capela and Nene. Bruce Brown is basically their Gerald Green. And now we’ve added Blake, with the potential to add another buyout guy as well"
"What did the Utah front office did before coming into this season that drastically improved their team? They brought Derrick Favors back...  That’s not much move at all, it was the same roster with continuity growing from the year before and everyone being healthy and grooving now.   Nets on the other hand basically retool half the farm to get Harden, with injury to Spencer Dinwiddie, addition of Jeff Green prior to start of the season, new addition of Blake, new coaching staff of Nash and Mr Pringles... it’s so much more impressive what they accomplished in short amount of time to put them in title contending position"
You think it would have been better for Boston to hold onto the OKC version of Perk instead of Jeff Green when the team had no wings behind Pierce on the roster?
I still want to know why we traded Jeff Green for him.  Easily our 2nd worst trade of the early 2010s
"Nah. JR Smith, Josh Smith, Jeff Green had talent. Harden has greatness."
"Nah. JR Smith, Josh Smith, Jeff Green had talent. Harden has greatness."
"nah bro, they are taking time to give him some jeff  green juice so he comes back the next game looking like lob city blake"
"&gt; I also don’t think Barnes can be an actual small ball 5 which would help Boston.  I get your point, but like, the Nets are closing games with Jeff Green at center, the Clippers are closing games with Marcus Morris at center, the Blazers are closing games with Melo at center, Suns are closing games with Saric at center etc."
no one talking about how blake finally got his guy jeff green  [https://www.radio.com/971theticket/articles/blake-griffin-says-he-whiffed-free-agent-recruiter-pistons-i-was-0-3-year](https://www.radio.com/971theticket/articles/blake-griffin-says-he-whiffed-free-agent-recruiter-pistons-i-was-0-3-year)
Jeff green is a top 5 player 3 days a year.
"That article has him fighting Gortat. In the months directly after he beefs with Brooks and Jeff Green and likely Oubre. Before all that Nene and Emeka Okafor.  On the court he 's tussled with Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart.  Goalposts. What do you want, a reacharound? What is it you want me to deliver? This conversation started about RW leading the league in techs since he's a hot headed dumbfuck but it's instead devolved into proving just how much of an ignoramus you are.   The original statement was that Russ never took the high road ever, never has, and continues not to as seen with his techs vs Wall and then getting tossed against Rondo. You're out to prove....what? That slandering Reggie Jackson as Wall did Gortat is ok? We've come far. Goalposts"
I really think that if a non-nba fan watched a Jeff green highlight reel they’d assume he was an all time great.
Jeff Green
"Have you watched him in Detroit?   Now, maybe he gets more mobile over the next few months. Maybe being wide open really helps him.  But honestly? I don't think he's better than Bruce Brown or Jeff Green right now. I don't think he's better than DeAndre. He's very obviously behind the Big Three and Harris. That's 7. I *guess* you might like him better than TLC and Shamet...maybe? I kinda like Claxton though."
"Nets don’t really have “scraps” though. They basically gave a six man and their starting big and a tonne of picks. Before the harden trade they were arguably the deepest team in the league. Outside of the big 3 they still have one of the best shooters in the nba (Joe Harris), a decent veteran forward (Jeff Green), Bruce Brown who’s been a really good two way do it all player, a very promising young big who can switch onto guards in Claxton and the washed up corpse of Deandre and Landry Shamet who kinda sucks now.   And this is all with the extremely untimely injury of Dinwiddie.   The only thing they lack is a big body inside for AD and Embiid every other team they can smoke pretty easily."
is he better than Jeff Green?
"Yeah, resigning Ibaka wasn’t a bad move at that time. Pre-Harden trade, the league was still fairly traditional and small ball was just coming up. Jeff Green produced good offense but average defense, so they traded for Perk who was a good low post defender at that time, pairing him with Ibaka who was up and coming and was a really good athletic weakside defender. I think ultimately, the Perkins contract was the one that made Harden resigning difficult. Harden was offered around $13M/yr and he wanted $15M/yr. Perk was given $8M a year iirc with that extension, paired with Ibaka’s extension $12M; that’s already $20M for two guys, not to mention KD and WB’s contracts to add to that. The league only had a $58M cap and a tax threshold of $70M."
"i think you do something similar to what the rockets and clippers have done against the warriors in recent years. you bait durant into playing iso ball, and try to cut off everyone else and kill ball movement.   difference tho is that the warriors had two guys that were amazing off ball, whereas the nets guys are all iso scorers, so iso ball is what brooklyn wants to play. obviously not going to work all of the time, but the less ball movement you get from the nets, the less they can hurt you (especially the role players).  on the other side, obviously you need to take advantage of the nets' lack of inside presence. attack the rim, drive and kick, offensive rebounds. you want to control the possessions and keep the game at a reasonable pace.  you don't want to get into a shootout.  i'm probably in the minority, but i don't think brooklyn is the favorite in the east. i can't trust a team that is going to have to play deandre jordan, jeff green and blake griffin 20+ minutes in a playoff game"
"You think most bench players are unreliable guys who cant be trusted to do certain things consistently at a high level? a good bench features reliable players that you can trust on a night basis to come in and do certain things. The raptors had a good bench because the guys who came off it were players like Vanvleet, Powell and Ibaka. If jeff Green was on that team theres a good chance he barely plays."
"Guaranteed Harden and those bois dont need that, Harden clicked immediately with the Nets. They were winning games right away with Jeff Green and Claxton as the main guys in the rotation scoring."
Who here remembers OKC-Boston jeff green? He was nice. Still is 👍
"/u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show *(featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament)*.   MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose *(the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06)*.  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT *(14-25)* on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's *(ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans)*. That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers *(and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots)*.  **26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG%** Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  **17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG%** Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  **19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG%** Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. [Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.](https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rose-dwarfs-other-improvements-with-defense/?_r=0)  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales *that* heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas **37 times that season.**  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;*""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""*  **Jason Kidd**  &gt;*""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.*  **Steve Nash**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""*  **Tyson Chandler**  &gt;*""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""*  **Magic Johnson**  &gt;*""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""*  **Michael Jordan**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""*  **Scottie Pippen**  &gt;*""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""*  **Kevin Love**  &gt;*""MVP.

Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""*  **Frank Vogel**  &gt;*""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""*  **Charles Barkley**  &gt;*""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""*  **Mike Breen**  &gt;*""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question.

Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""*  **Doc Rivers**  &gt;*""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP.

He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""*  **Gregg Popovich**  &gt;*""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""*  **Juwan Howard**  &gt;*""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter.

If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""*  **Chris Bosh**  &gt;*""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""*  **Lebron** when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;*""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers.

"I doubt Tucker will have DNP, I think there’s a chance esp if the Nets go to a small ball lineup that they play Tucker/Giannis because Brook will get played off the floor against Jeff Green at the 5"
Danny Green/Jaylen Brown/Jeff Green/Wiggins/Barrett/Divincenzo
mfs playing Steven Adams over 30 minutes against Jeff Green lmaooooo David Griffin &amp; SVG are fuckin bozos
Jeff Green keep trying to catch bodies out here
Jeff Green is so much better than a minimum player but keeps getting the min year after year. He's a 5-8mil kinda player idk how he gets so underpaid
Jeff Green throws down some pretty hard dunks for a 34 year old.   Love me some Uncle Jeff
"Its not that hes a bad player, but hes not the kind of guy you can trust on a nightly basis to come in and make an impact. If you need a wing to come in a soak some minutes then Jeff Green is decent but anything more than that and he’ll disappoint you"
"I mean if at any point you have to seriously rely on someone like Jeff Green, you probably have a bad bench"
I'm convinced Jeff Green is an alternate reality LeBron that wanted to chill a little more.
Bro how the fuck Jeff Green still out here putting people on posters
“suck my dick” -jeff green
Jeff Green??  That Jeff Green???  The 34 year old Jeff Green?????
Jeff Green said frick smoothies
damn Jeff Green looking spry
Jeff Green just sent it. Geez
"The Nets outside of their big 3 have Joe Harris (one of the top 3 poimt shooters), Landry Shamet ( slowly turning into one of the best 3 poimt shooters), Jeff Green ( very valuable role player), Blake Griffin ( still decent) and Claxton who is a very versatile defender. Who tf do the sixers have outside of their big 3? Danny Green and shake Milton? Who do the bucks have on their supporting cast? A 36 year old PJ Tucker? Lmao."
"part of that is because there is so much more quality competing for those accolades like 1st team.  Magic and Bird, the Lakers and the Celtics, they owned the league on the 80s not only because they were great, but because the rest of the league really was not great (other than the 1983 Sixers)   Being the best player on the Lakers or Celtics was an automatic 1st team selection and a good shot at a ring.    Go look at the roster of the 1984 all-star game.  Jeff Ruland.  Kelly Tripuka.  Jim Paxson.  Rickey Green.  FFS.    Meanwhile, poor Dame Lillard gets aced out of all-star games for years because he happens to play guard in the same conference as Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Russ Westbrook. Chris Paul, Tony Parker, etc."
Jeff Green contributed some points and rebounds and everyone celebrated like he was Igoudala or Livingston. That’s how little help Lebron had.
Also just had Danny Green and Tobias Harris vs Jeff Green and Joe Harris
"Bro what the fuck? We're arguing a hypothetical right now. Im not saying the Heat ARE that good, Im saying if they got a version of Oladipo that was better than his 23ppg, 37% pt shooting, 1st team all defense indiana pacers self, alongside Herro and Robinson playing the best basketball of their careers, they would be.  Did you just forget what we were talking about because you're boner for the nets was just THAT hard? Because THAT would be embarrassing.   As a side note, 2 great 3pt shooters, jeff green and the corpse of blake griffin is not an incredible supporting cast."
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"Full extension I guess or if Jeff Green got knocked on his ass.  Something extremely blatant.  Jeff Green didn't even complain about it to the ref.  Not one Nets player even looked at the ref. Jeff still got a hand up, Bam hit it, game over"
Jeff green gave him way too much room. Hopefully he realizes that.
"DJ generally doesn't close. If Claxton is playing all the minutes Nash wants to play him, and he's closing with Jeff Green or Claxton at center, I don't see why it matters all that much."
"Jeff green really should have shot it when he was wide open, that was the catalyst for all that happened"
Jeff Green probably has the worst highlight plays to highlight plays on him ratio in the league
Jeff green a shook one
Jeff Green on Bam is laughable coaching by Nash there
Ohhh that was cold Jeff Green
"Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet isn't insane depth if luckily 2-3 of them even get  a chance to play in the playoffs for over 5 minutes"
"Danny had way too many draft picks to use and didn't find a trade he liked so ended up using all of them. Every year we seem to replace productivr established talent with rookie contracts. It all came to a head this year where we lost Gordon Hayward, Brad Wanamaker, and Enes Kanter with Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. This season was always going to be hard with so much of the roster being made up of rookie contracts.    Look at all the other high seeds above above Boston and you see teams that added veterans. Milwaukee went out and got Holiday, Philly got Curry, Green and Dwight, Brooklyn sold the farm for Harden and filled out the roster with cheap veterans like Jeff Green.  The young players needed to get on the court and either show they're NBA level players or not so Ainge can finally make a decision on some of these guys. Pritchard broke out early and Timelord came on strong late."
"So you don't think Harden maximizes roleplayers?  He's arguably the best in the league at making dudes who were out of the league look like they belong on playoff teams.  Faried Rivers Mclemore House Jeff Green Eric Gordon  The list goes on of guys that he basically revitalized the careers of.   The entire strategy that our F.O used was to find cheap contracts and guys no one else wanted and let Harden simplify everything for them so they were playable again.   The addition of ""every great team"" isn't honest to the subject. This Warriors team is not a great team and neither were most of those Rockets teams. Most teams aren't great, which is why most need their star on ball."
"You're the worst of r/Lakers. Jesus this is dumb.  I watched the game 2 games ago and he was flat out bad. That's what's going to happen. 1 game looks alright, other game looks horrible.  Have you ever heard of the basketball player Jeff Green? You might not see him in HoH clips."
"If Paul George is the best Jeff Green in the league, Wiggins surely has to be second best."
"Harden is the most overrated player in the NBA THIS YEAR*  Emphasis on this year because people believe he is the MVP or a top 3 candidate at least. I cannot agree with rating a player so high based on how they play with excellent teammates and overlook their play with worse teammates. Harden averages roughly 11 assists with one of the best scorers/shooters ever in KD, a guy who may enter the 50/40/90 club this season in Kyrie, another guy who was pretty close for a whole in Joe Harris, another almost 50/40 player in Jeff green.  He's surrounded by excellent shooters and yet people are going so far as to say he's a top 3 player? For me eve. Top 5 has to be argued. I'm not a Harden hater by any means but I got LeBron, Giannis, Curry easy above him. Also KD, Kawhi, Embiid. And Jokic are also all players having seasons that put them on par or above Harden this year.  And the people who say KD isn't the best on the Nets Cuz of Harden? Maybe you say that because he hasn't played as much but the numbers? 28/7/5 on FIFTY FOUR PECENT SHOOTING? In 34 minutes I mean cmon. People act like KD is a shell of his former self..."
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
I watched the first qtr of the 76ers/Nets game as I was falling asleep for a nap. Simmons was on Kyrie to start. Then they moved Simmons to Jeff Green cuz he couldn’t keep up. Then I fell asleep.
"Nets since Im neutral but a Sonics fan for life, seeing KD &amp; Jeff green out there is the closest i can get"
Jeff Green was close to retiring
we called this guy flattop Jeff green
" ""the supporting cast was insanely deep""?   That's a very nice way of saying they fucking sucked. Jeff Green was the hero of the Cavs playoff run because he stepped up in 3 or 4 important games in typical inconsistent Jeff Green fashion.   The only time the Cavs supporting cast played up to their potential was in the Toronto series but that was mostly due to their opponents capitulating and being mentally defeated playing against LeBronto."
"How does the average person test for something like this? I feel like there have been a good number of incidents in the NBA, Cuttino Mobley, Jeff Green and a few others."
Jeff Green is dying?
On Jeff Green?
"I've always wondered if tall people like NBA players are more at-risk for these things. Reggie Lewis died of a heart disease but there's a lot of players in recent years who's had problems even though they're world-class athletes.   Cuttino Mobley, Channing Frye, and Lamarcus Aldridge had irregular heartbeat, Jeff Green had an enlarged artery, and Bosh and Teletovic had their careers ended with blood clots. I think Varejeo had it as well."
"Im still waiting on an answer on why Jeff Green has been on the minimum contract for years. 3 and D guy who can kinda guard 1-5 and closes out games for good teams in the past few years in the Nets, Rockets, Cavs  I would have glady paid him 10mill to be on the Nuggets"
"I mean Kyrie just dropped 37 pts and 9 asts starting alongside Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, and Landry Shamet....Phil;y cant guard any of these guys"
People have to start talking about how great the nets bench is. Claxson is a monster and Bruce Brown is just good. Jeff Green also is a great offensive player. With all their guys missing yeah they dangerous
For perspective: Jeff Green is 6'8 240lbs
"Yeah, Tobias probably won't be able to bully Harden or Blake or even Jeff Green. Heck, I would even put KD's length and quickness on him. Nets are just short bodies tonight. Won't read too much into it."
"he sent Jeff Green flying, Clax would have no shot lol"
Jeff Green looks like he has lost weight
"I mean, idk much about Jeff Green but the other four are legitimate starters. Crazy things happen in the NBA, I mean we just lost to the Pelicans who were on the second night of a B2B.   The fact that the Nets can rest so many guys and still put out a lineup like this is crazy."
"Jeff green, he has been so consistent for us the entire season"
"Jae Crowder (yes he was traded but he was on that team), Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance jr, JR Smith &amp; Tristan Thompson as support around a consistent 3rd option scoring 16-18ppg (there is max 3 teams in the league right now that could say no to such a 3rd option...) in Kevin Love, and THEN you have Kyrie and Lebron. Really don't believe i'm overhyping them, it's just not true Lebron was alone against the world."
"2nd Cavs team was stacked with a bunch of people excelling in their roles like Korver, Henneyboy, Thompson and people that played awesome directly after that for other teams like Rodney Hood and Jeff Green. Yeah this Lakers team is great but why is everyone lying about the  2nd Cavs team? They were a fine-tuned squad with excellent players on nearly all spots."
This man just said the Celtics have a chance now because Jeff Green is out lmao.  The Nets still have 3 superstars who have dominated the last 6 quarters of that series.
This sucks. Wanted to see Bucks vs Nets with both teams at full strength. Now we won’t see Donte and most likely won’t see Jeff Green either.
Would have been Jeff Green. They might try Blake Griffin for some time to not sacrifice KD
Yeah it’s gonna be interesting because we likely won’t have Jeff green for the start of the series so we won’t have an ideal closing 5 either. well either have to play claxton or Blake which allows you to hide Lopez more easily on defense. Or we go super small with Durant at the 5 and risk getting overran by Giannis
Oof sorry bucks fans. I consider this equivalent to nets losing Jeff green. Not one of the big 3 but a main cog in the rotation.
"look Marcus not easy to love, but you doing him dirty here calling him high volume Jeff Green 😬 he was our best player last year (wow..what a thought) and shot like 50% from 3 this year"
"It’s cause of their hole in center   Blake/Claxton/Jeff Green when he comes back is their front court. Blake is slow, Clax is inexperienced and Jeff is not a defensive guy. So when it comes to opposing bigs running the paint, grabbing rebounds, or open lanes for wings and guards to get to rim, they might not be able to adequately defend"
Interior Defense and the injury of Jeff Green
"&gt; Also he ran PnRs with Jeff Green a lot last year and that worked even tho Green isn’t a lob threat  Their PnR effiicency last year was pretty wild if I remember correctly.  Over 1.1 PPP, and it may have been hovering around the 1.3 mark, but I forget."
Harden’s effective with space. Clippers have tons of shooters.  Also he ran PnRs with Jeff Green a lot last year and that worked even tho Green isn’t a lob threat
"Sonics trading Ray Allen away. Then drafting KD, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka, and Jeff Green"
"DeAndre Jordan is out of the rotation, Nets centers are Blake Griffin, Jeff Green (who will probably miss a good chunk of the series if not all of it), and Nic Claxton."
"Jeff Green cooks the Celtics in the playoffs. Wish he was as deadly when we had him. This is a shame, hope he heals up."
With Jeff green out their 5 out lineup is seriously hampered. Brook is gonna drop a lot with all the Claxton minutes and some of the blake minutes if he's bricking.
Jeff Green type beat.
ed davis and jeff green seem like lifetimes ago
"Also we had the best offensive rating in the league after the Clarkson trade on Christmas through the end of the non-bubble regular season &amp; followed it up with one of the best offensive ratings in a playoff series ever. We made a few moves around that trade (ed davis benched, jeff green let go, exum gone obvs) that changed things. TBH I kinda expected this coming into the season, it was the defense that I wasn't sure about."
"A blow for Brooklyn: Jeff Green has a strained plantar fascia and will be re-evaluated in ten days, Steve Nash said."
Jeff Green had the same injury wtf
This series is so disappointing. I was sure it was gonna go 6 at least (&amp; I need it to go that far cuz Jeff Green gonna be out for the rest of our series now)
Doesn't this also open up more minutes for Blake? I feel like Jeff Green is the perfect complimentary role player to the Nets Big 3. Whereas Blake may take a few shots too many despite being less efficient than the big 3.
"nets just dont need jeff green, they could probbaly play 4v5 and still win"
"&gt; arguably their second most important role player  That's a fancy way of saying ""maybe the 5th best player on the team"". You can see why people don't have much sympathy. The Suns have a severely hampered best player, multiple West teams have their best players coming back from injury (Lakers, Jazz), and the past few years have had monumentally impactful injuries to series and playoff shifting players  Y'all gonna be okay without Jeff Green and if not then y'all weren't really serious contenders"
"This isn't the end of the world, but let me explain why this is more important than a lot of you guys think.  1. Jeff Green is a really solid role player. Due to injuries/COVID he has started 36 games. Per 36 minutes, he is averaging 14.7/5.2/2.1. He's shooting 56.2% from 2, 41.2% on 4.9 3's and 78% from the line. This leads to a super efficient 62.4 ts% Obviously these numbers are boosted from the very easy looks created from Harden and this team. He's also our other vocal leader on the court besides Harden  2. He's the center on our smallball lineups, it's doubtful we have that option  3. Our tallest wing besides KD is now 6'6, that's terrifying against this Bucks team  We're going to see a lot of Claxton. He's great but this is a tough matchup, I'm very worried about him getting in foul trouble. His pnr defense was exclusively switching, so this was be new for him. There are a lot of different schemes and lineups that we can play, it will be very interesting to see what Nash does. This is a meaningful loss, especially in a Bucks series  [Don't forget that Uncle Jeff also throws down an incredible poster every game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwt4pzdEigE)"
If Jeff green cant play vs us that is a massive blow for yall. Theres no way you can expect Blake and KD to guard Giannis for an extended amount of time.
"They currently dislike Aaron Gordon and it's got me kinda torn. Lol. Hell, almost any remaining Magic alumni in the playoffs gets hated on by Magic fans. Elfrid, Aaron, Dwight, Serge, Jeff Green etc. Magic fans got problems with all of them. Tobias is the only one safe."
"Russ, KD, harden, Jeff green, Roberson, and TLC all on the same team would give seasonal depression"
Jeff Green wouldn’t change guarding Giannis   It’ll be Claxton and KD for the most part. Possibly Harden if other things aren’t working
Y’all are hurting so bad for talent. What are you ever going to do without 34-year-old Jeff Green.   Why is the universe so against the Nets
"Wtf the start of this sentence terrified me.   Like yeah Jeff Green is a solid player but calling it ""a blow for Brooklyn"" made it sound like it was one of the Big 3."
Loved Jeff Green on this team.
2* Jeff Green and KD
Nets cuz KD and Jeff Green
"I think a big problem for them for the second year in a row is they have no rim protection. The only way they can have that is by playing Zubac, but as a traditional big he's susceptible to getting switched and instead having to guard a ball handler on the perimeter.   Something that was really telling last night was when the Clippers won the challenge on that Pat Beverley foul call and it was a jump ball, the Clippers had Kawhi jumping against Porzingis (and KP predictably won the jump easily). Kawhi was effectively the Clippers' center, and really he's just a small forward. It's really tough to win when you have no power forwards or centers on the floor, because even if your perimeter D is good, if anyone gets past it, it's an easy bucket at the rim. Even the micro-ball Rockets last year played Jeff Green or PJ Tucker out there."
Jeff Green has been solid off the bench this season
"Honestly I think they're going to have a much harder time with the Bucks and 6ers than people are expecting, both teams play great perimeter defense and the Nets don't have anyone on their roster that can guard Embiid, their best matchup for Giannis is probably Jeff Green who's a good defender but idk about guarding Giannis for 7 games."
This isn’t even a discussion lol. OPs points boil down to “Joe Harris and Jeff Green at better 3 point shooters than Andre and Draymond so the nets offense is better”
Actually his moves- particularly lineups- were widely mocked when he made them but they almost always paid offf. Jeff Green at center revitalized his career but most of /r/nba thought Lue was a fucking moron for it. It easily was the key move that won us the series against Boston.
Thats why I didn’t bring up scoring or offensive rating. I’m just looking at the individual players. And it simply is easier to exploit Draymond/Iggy than Joe Harris and Jeff Green. If we are looking just at the Big 3 then the Warriors get the edge.
Did you even watch the games? Draymond shot 39% from 3FG in the 73 win season. But once KD came he was a crap 3 point shooter and midrange shooter. Teams could leave him WIDE OPEN and that destroyed the Warriors spacing. The Nets don’t have that type of weak shooter in their closing line up. With Jeff Green and Joe Harris the Nets have zero weaknesses on offense.
"it seems like the nets are good example of this. you have some of the most talented players in teh league. but jeff green is the main ""leader"" and hype man"
"shamet, Jeff green, and Claxton are good for the amount of minutes you play them, so imo they're still ""trash"" for starters. you wouldn't want to play them starter minutes in the finals when your starting lineup is ""3 superstars + 1 elite shooter"" . so you have would-be-trash-playoff-starters instead be your average bench players supplementing 3 superstars playing \~38 mpg. im excited to see them go toe-to-toe with Giannis/jrue/middleton and potentially embiid/simmons/harris."
"Yup  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ljgmob/post_game_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_1612_defeat/gnchlpb/  All the people clamoring about their defense as if it was gonna be the worst the playoffs have ever seen are idiots.  That comment was back in February and they only played a couple more games together after that. So ridiculous that people throwing out all these judgements about a team who didn't give a fuck about defense, had two injured stars taking time, and a flat-earther who kept taking personal leave  No team with 3 bona fide superstars + Blake Griffin and Joe Harris is going to be anything but frightening as fuck in the playoffs, when the veteran stars turn on the intensity and are actually playing together.  The Nets are surprisingly deep. The Blake Griffin acquisition is wild with how he looked in Detroit (people saying he has to retire) compared to now. You got players like Shamet, Jeff Green, Claxton all contributing off the bench at a level you'd think would make them a starter on a ""3 superstars + trash"" type team that people were expecting. Even players like Tyler Johnson, Mike James, and Cabarrot looked good at times last year, and they're fighting to just see the court at all with how deep the Nets are."
Couldn’t be more perfect. Open Joe Harris 3 or open Jeff Green dunk. Pick your poison.
Not even the last Sonic on the Nets right now...Jeff Green played there too
Wasn’t Jeff green a supersonic
His offense isn't good either... Im saying he's not better than Jeff green. I would legitimately have Jeff green over Blake Griffin as a Nets fan (and a guy that watched Jeff green last year).
Jeff green has been really good for them this year…
"statistically, ""6th"" option behind Jeff Green"
Jeff Green is huge for the nets my dude
"Lmao Marv really called Jeff Green a ""very valuable player"" for the Nets. Hilarious."
Boy that Joe Harris 3 looks sure like a Jeff green dunk to me
Idk I just really dislike the guy. I've also never liked Harden so there's that too. Also Jeff Green just makes Celtics lives miserable for eternity which isn't fun
Jeff Green has received a lot of criticism for never quite living up to the expectations but in totality he's had a really nice career and is still a valuable NBA player on a contender.
"Jeff Green was drafted with the Celtics pick in 2007 3 picks after KD and now they're together to beat the Celtics, how beautiful."
Boston has literally no player on their roster capable of guarding Jeff Green.
Jeff Green was the Celtics pick from the Ray Allen trade
Damn when did jeff green get smacked in the schnozz?
Can't believe the nba let Joe Harris team up with Jeff Green and Bruce Brown.
Was that the same party that Steve Nash and Mike d'antoni were at with Joe harris and Jeff green?
"I totally agree, this lineup might be the best in the league to stop the Nets but it still just seems like such an uphill battle if they're playing five out with 4 elite shooters and another capable shooter in Jeff Green.  However, I do think the Bucks could feast on the other end of the ball as well. Excited to see the series happen (hopefully)"
"I'm not saying this to talk trash, but I was kinda surprised at how much bigger Lopez looked compared to Bam—I only really see the Heat when they play the Sixers so it's not a surprise that Embiid is bigger but I thought Bam was more Capela-sized  I know small-ball 5s are all the rage but if you looked from afar and told me that was Jeff Green or Thad Young I wouldn't doubt you (size-wise, obvi Bam is better than them)  Maybe he's a 4? Heat looked way better with him and Dedmon together on the floor tonight"
"&gt;Edit: I was dying laughing just imagining him having over the top goat potential but instead just chilling, making millions and trolling the fuck out of people  We already have a Jeff Green"
Says the fan of the team that is basically our old team? I mean... you guys even have Jeff Green.
"Decent options in UFA are Olynyk, Jeff Green, Hardaway Jr, Millsap, Rivers, Bazemore, McConnell, McDermott, Markieff, Harkless, Tucker, James Johnson, Bullock, Burks, Noel, Danny Green, Dwight, Torrey Craig, Kanter, RHJ, Gay, Mills, RoLo."
Jeff Green here. i hate every teammate i’ve ever played against
"No one thought they had enough assets to get Harden and they made the trade without giving up Kyrie/Harris. That alone is a huge w. But even ignoring that trade, he added Jeff Green/Blake on cheap deals, made a great trade for Brown and a solid trade for Shamet, and resigned Harris who had an exceptional year. And that's not mentioning the Nash/MDA additions which have worked out great."
"Crowder is better when not playing with Lebron. So are all the cleveland guys basically. Clarkson, Rose, JR, Shump, TT,  Jeff Green and Hood lol"
George Hill and Jeff Green will still be in the league 20 years from now
Jeff Green
Kemba was missing shots but Tatum was getting Ded up hard by KD and Jeff Green.
"I know they winning but I feel like Harden is abit too comfortable passing away shots. There were numerous times he had the lane for a floater but chose to dish out for a Jeff Green 3, I’d rather one of the most gifted offensive players of all time take a shot there."
Jeff Green is gonna get so many open looks in the playoffs.
Jeff Green with the exclamation three
"I love the Jeff Green/Vince Carter comparison. Vince was better than this, but they are both in the Hall of Very Good."
Still think Jeff Green at the 5 is the Nets best closing lineup
"biggest upside if the nets win the championship is jeff green gets a ring, nobody can be mad about that"
Jeff green is tatted?
Jeff Green had himself a good nba career
"Jesus Christ, Jeff Green telling them they need to talk shows how much this Nets team isn’t a team."
Jeff Green seems like one of those dudes that can't talk.
Jeff Green smallball 5 or they play Claxton.  Blake will get switched on by great teams.
jeff green should be universally loved for his insatiable need to yam at any cost
"Harden is about to check in, and if Jeff Green is still in then there will be a 3 in the first 3 bklyn possessions"
most likable nets:  1. jeff green  2. steve nash  3. james harden  DNQ: durant
Jeff Green is arguably more important than Harden
Feels like Jeff Green is on like 5 different teams every year.
"gotta love jeff green, he's such a warrior"
im just here ti say wiggins is the new jeff green
"When the Cavs won Game 7 in Boston to get to the finals, Jeff Green was their second best offensive and defensive player"
Mike James is shooting liek 30% TS &amp; all Landry &amp; Jeff Green have been doing is shooting 3’s.  They’re not the creators Ingles &amp; Bojan are.
"If you're counting Bogdanovic &amp; Ingles as bucket getters then Brooklyn have Jeff Green, Shamet, Dinwiddie, Mike James, Blake in addition to their Big 4."
"So the supporting cast severely underachieved in the playoffs. Guys like TT, Jr Smith (lol), George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Kyle Korver, and Larry Nance were/are all super solid. They all were good supporting cast players at that point in their careers and some even after that season."
"Tbh he almost reminds me of like Jeff Green. Very good body, pretty decent skill level, but like no BBIQ."
He doesn't deserve credit.   I still remember when he went out in the 18 Celtics series and Jeff green doing a 1000× better
"Somehow I thought Jeff Green and Danny Green before Draymond, my less dumb brother."
"Larry bird to Aaron Gordon interestingly enough are connected by only two franchises, BOS and ORL. 3 players who played for both franchises connect them - Greg Kite, Shaq, Jeff Green  It goes Bird/Kite (BOS), Kite/Shaq (ORL), Shaq/Green (BOS), Green/Gordon (ORL)"
LeBron is obviously not 100% and you can't base who's better off of one game lmao. Jeff Green has outplayed LeBron before
"Shaq too, I feel like he played with so many different teams and teammates. Just off the top of my head, the Magic in ‘92 I believe, can’t really remember how that team was constituted, to the Lakers with Gary Payton and Karl Malone and Robert Horry, to the Heat with Udonis Harlem I believe, to the Suns, they might have had Goran Dragic and Jared Dudley back then? Forgive me, I’m trying to do this without googling. Then you have that stint with LeBron and the Cavs, and the Celtics, who I think had Jeff Green."
Or Jeff Green or Trevor Ariza.  Ariza has played for like 12 teams I think.
It's almost certainly D'Antoni.  A lot of the stuff you see with Jeff Green is almost identical to what they were doing in Houston when Green was on that team too.
"So LBJ/AD were a Superteam? Nets weren't even called a Superteam before the trade, they lose Harden, Jeff green, Spencer, Allen and Levert and still get called a Superteam? Seems to me you just don't want to give credit were credit is due"
"yes. the clippers, lakers, bucks, etc. are way more stacked than nets minus spence, harden, and jeff green. the revisionist coping is strong"
"They're destroying the Bucks missing Harden, Jeff Green, and Spencer Dinwiddie.  They aren't just fair, they're playing with a handicap."
"No harden no dinwiddie no Jeff green, no excuses for the bucks"
And then when they lose y’all will complain about Blake Griffin and Jeff Green.   They clapping their revamped Bucks without Harden. Give KD and Kyrie they flowers instead of bitching about superteams.
Or Jeff Green/Harden
"With Harden, Jeff Green, LMA, and Spencer the Nets win by 100 points."
Nets are missing James Harden and Jeff Green lol.   Injury doesn't excuse why's occured thus far
Lmao no. Dude averaged 4 PPG against the Heat.       Also Nets are missing Harden and Jeff Green
Yeah Jeff Green. That was the biggest missing piece for the Nets
"Don’t forget Jeff green is out.   Bucks are out here making old Blake griffin look like a star again and white, even shorter fvv look like the real fvv. I’m astounded."
How did you not mention jeff green lmao
What about Jeff green ?
Jeff green is a big rotation piece for them as well
all this without harden and jeff green….lmao
Losing to Nets is ok but definitely not by 40+ points without Jeff Green.  What are you doing Bucks???
or Jeff Green
With James Harden and Jeff Green especially likely coming back if the Nets do drop and are in a pinch?
Perry the new Jeff Green? Lol
Jeff Green
Lol I was just playing but putting dinwiddie and Jeff green in that sentence with harden is very funny
"yeah, THAT's why you uguys are down 30 against a team without Harden, Dinwiddie, and Jeff Green. It's Dante DiVencenzo."
Nets still have another 40% 3 point shooter (Jeff Green)coming  back at some point
"and Jeff Green. Oh, and that Harden guy"
"They were ISO heavy because Boston switches almost everything, it isn't a case of laziness, Bucks play more of a traditional defense for some reason and they work it better off the ball.  Nets rotations were completely fine against the Celtics, the issue was personnel, Tatum was killing everybody that switched on him from G3-5 because with Jeff Green out, the only person in the Nets with a prayer to defend him was KD, who doesn't exactly fight over screens."
It's absolutely wild that this team could be more skilled with Harden and Jeff Green
"They didn’t give up that much depth  It was more of the picks they gave up then the players.  They still had Bowen, Claxton, Jeff Green and then signed BG, Aldridge I"
Or Jeff green
No Harden. Jeff Green. Spencer Dinwiddie. And technically LMA
"Keep in mind Harden, Dinwiddie, and Jeff Green aren't even available to play.  The Nets aren't a super team with them missing. The Bucks have just played like shit to far"
Or Jeff green...
and imagine if harden and jeff green were playing lol
"Reminder: This is without Harden, Dinwiddie, and Jeff Green"
man this nets team is just unfair.  remember they still don't have harden/dinwiddie/jeff green yet.
Nah Nets for Jeff Green
They’re getting blown out multiple games without Nets 3rd best player and Jeff Green LOL
Nets won't even need Jeff Green to play in this series with how well its going rn
# THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WITHOUT HARDEN OR LMA OR JEFF GREEN
And Jeff Green and Spencer Dinwiddie.
"Lol harden and Jeff Green aren't even playing, this is comparable to beginning of the season nets and the bucks can't do shit. Incredibly disappointing."
And Jeff Green
Jeff Green too
It’s insane they’re literally missing a MVP level player.  And a solid player who was a former all star ended his season early.  A nice player  who was a partial leader in the Nets comeback seasons is injured.  And another solid role player in Jeff Green is down.  What the fuck
Luka has to play the terminator twice while Trae got to play the Knicks and Jeff Green with more shot attempts  Trae also has a way better supporting cast and depth
"Kevin Martin and the picks that became Jeremy Lamb and Steven Adams.   What has gotten lost to history is that Harden had to be traded because the owners were cheap. They could have been able to afford Harden had they not traded Jeff Green for Kendrick Perkins, who was given a very fat contract extension to be basically unplayable. That trade was the beginning of the end for OKC.   In an alternate universe they don't make that trade, they extend Harden and win a couple of titles."
Jeff Green and Bruce Brown were franchise players?
"Harden will be back by at least the end of this series or by the ECF. Jeff Green, while solid, is not a game-changer, and Dinwiddie has been injured all season.  The Nets are cakewalking to a championship more than any other team in history (with the exception of maybe the 2017 Warriors)."
Nets losing James Harden (primary facilitator) and Jeff green (closing small ball 5) for game 2 probably means Blake will probably play 30 minutes again because he's able to fill both of those roles to some extent.
"He absolutely curb stomped the East in 2017. In 2018 that team sucked and every series was an expert class in adjustments. He has had the most flexible rosters of any coach in the league imo. He always has shocking adjustments that are *wildly* criticized and they often reap huge results. Jeff green at center was one of the most mocked lineups on /r/nba in 2018 and it not only was the key to beating the Celtics, it rejuvenated his career. Saying anyone is expected to go to 3 straight finals is crazy. Just look at this series coming back from 0-2."
"Tell that to Russell Westbrook, Luka (twice), Jeff Green, and Ben Simmons."
"only comparable one I can think of is Nets Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, KD, Jeff Green lineup"
Jeff Green has played well in this role this year. He won't D up an embiid or jokic but basically any other team
Jeff Green is a big loss because the work best with 5 out.  Without Jeff Green they now have to play a small guard to go 5 out or play a roll man.  Sure this is first world problems but an issue nonetheless.
Need to take care of the home games and get Jeff Green back
"Yeah I could see him leaving. We have the MLE to offer next season so I feel like we’d offer that to either Blake or Jeff Green. Even though Jeff is older I think I’d rather keep him next season. He’s been a great glue guy, and is still a pretty solid player. Getting him on a minimum this season was a steal."
Nets are sneaky deep. Even if Harden doesn't play another game I still consider them the favorite. Joe Harris and Blake Griffin could play the third wheel next to Kyrie and KD. Jeff Green coming back ..
"His first scoring title back in the 09-10 season. He averaged 30ppg and lead OKC to a 50 win season, the 2nd &amp; 3rd leading scorers were Westbrook (16ppg) and Jeff Green (15ppg).  And also shout out to his MVP season when they had like a two month stretch with Westbrook out and KD just started putting up some monster numbers, and OKC almost had a 60 win season."
Jeff green for the nets as well
"Yeah and in a game like this, I just tune out man. Like I am OK watching garbage time, I will watch every game until the end, but show me the fucking game. Couldn't see Blake tech, cuz close up Jeff Green. At this point I think TNT crew never watched a competitive sports in their life, and just winging it."
"Joe Harris is actually good. Blake Griffin is washed but still ok. Shamet is alright. Bruce Brown is decent. Claxton isn't bad. That they get to play with Kyrie, Durant, and Harden amplifies their abilities a bunch. Not to mention Jeff Green who's day-to-day.  Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Luwawu-Cabarrot can all give you minutes and not get picked on or have to force dumb shit to make an impact. Their depth is actually completely ridiculous. Dinwiddie being out doesn't even seem to matter.  Meanwhile Bryn Forbes is playing 20 plus minutes. Yikes."
"Bro I genuinely think they are dumb. Like legit some dude thinks thats a great shot to show when they show jeff green the 95th time, while he is doing nothing interesting."
"No Jeff Green, no Beard and still balled out the bucks. Impressive performance. But the bucks didn't show up. Next games will be different."
Whos jeff green?
"No Jeff Green, no Beard and still balled out the bucks. Impressive performance. But the bucks didn't show up. Next games will be different."
"Jeff Green has been great for us, it was really masked by how well Blake played."
Is jeff green really that important to the nets? We’re yall the same people trash talking jeff green whilst he was on the cavs?
they would have some depth if they still had Jeff green. Nash playing KD and Griffin a lot more because he's out.
TNT acting like Jeff Green about to pull a magic trick and get on the court with seconds left in the game
"How hard is it to show the actual game instead of some dude on the sideline? Do you think I like watching Jeff green watching the game instead of me actually seeing the play? TNT, this is not even greed like ads you show every other second, but straight up incompetence."
TNT director doing a trash job cutting to a 15sec shot of Jeff Green right after Griffin intentionally walks over Thanasis (a tiff that had been brewing since he checked in).
DONT FORGET THE NETS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE JEFF GREEN AND LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE RIGHT NOW TOO
WHYD TNT SWITCH TO JEFF GREEN I WANTED TO SEE THE SAUCE
Jeff Green just tryin to go home lmao
Blake stepping over Thanasis ... can we stop showing Jeff Green when there is drama on the court
"no Jeff green, harden, or dinwiddie btw"
"lol all these BS calls in the Bucks favor, and they're still getting blown out without Jeff Green and Harden."
This will all be worth it to see my boy Jeff green get a ring
Jeff green gon get it
No Harden or Jeff Green either the Nets are insane
Crazy when you realize they’re missing Harden and Jeff Green
and Jeff Green and Dinwiddie
why is the camera panning to jeff green all the time?
"No Harden, no Jeff Green for the overrated Nets. Don't they know ISOs are bad? Stupid Nets. But wait?? they're winning??? Man this shit is so rigged. Silver really has the refs shooting all of the bucks' threes, so unfair"
Wow I had no idea Jeff Green was a Smashing Pumpkins fan
Bucks losing to the Nets without Harden and Jeff Green is sad
Between Jeff green and Danny green it’s probably a lock
Rondo and Jeff Green
Nets are also missing Jeff Green who is just as important as Divincenzo
Harden Jeff Green and LMA*
Jeff Green would be huge at center with Brook
"Just because their big 3 scores a lot doesn’t mean their depth sucks. Joe Harris, Bruce brown, Blake, Jeff green, Claxton and Shamet are all good players."
"“Bench warmer, he’s only getting minutes because Jeff Green is hurt.”"
Jeff Green wearing a Smashing Pumpkins shirt is the coolest random thing I’ve seen this week
What band will Jeff Green rep in the next game? I'm thinking Talking Heads.
Nets are doing this without Harden and Jeff Green but r/nba think Bucks can upset them lmaooo
Just wanted to log on here to say that Jeff Green looks sharp as fuck on the sidelines
Jeff Green has some pudding pops in that cardigan
Jeff Green out too right?
Go yawnis! Defeat the big 3 of kd Kyrie and jeff green :)
"That's a reasonable opinion that I'd probably agree with, but you sound like a brain-dead casual when you bring up Harden lol. Jeff Green was the one who really stepped up with KD tonight"
"KD and Jeff Green, we're gonna get a team in Seattle again"
Jeff Green 7/8 from 3... Wtf
Steph Green  Jeff Curry
It literally took a career night from Jeff green and a historical night from KD just to barely beat the Bucks tonight. People on this sub really need to put things into perspective and not be so reactionary.
"Because Jeff Green is on a way cheaper contract, coming off an injury, and like 5 billion years old on his 10th team"
"Don’t count on refs, Jeff green, Blake, etc."
Either of Jeff Green 27pts on 8/11 FGs and Blake 17 pts on 7/11 FGs are  better than the 2nd best Cavs with Klove putting up 21 pts on 9/20 FGs  Even a shit game from Harden drew Jrue away from the other Nets players all game and he still had 8 assists and 3 clutch FTs
"Don't get me wrong - I love Klay and I think he doesn't get the love he deserves. But KD was on another level tonight  Klay had only 4 rebounds and 0 assists, but with solid defense (1 steal and 1 block) - not to mention Curry also had 31 pts, 10 rebs, and 9 asts (1 shy of triple double) that game  KD had more points, more rebounds, more assists, more steals, and more blocks than Klay, and his 2nd most productive teammate was Jeff Green, not Steph Curry"
"Yeah  KD had an all time performance   Jeff Green went 7/8 from 3  Blake was 7/11  And it was still barely a win thanks to KDs heroics   I dont see Blake being that efficient AND Green putting up 20+ while in Mil for the next game, even if KD has another legendary performance"
"Picked a great fucking time to have your one game a year that makes people ask, “Why has Jeff Green played for 11 different teams?”"
Monster triple dub with efficient shooting and 48mins?! Good lord..   Also Jeff Green is such a silent stud
Jeff green baby
"So, as a help defender, think of it as his job to assist if the primary man gets beat or anything along those lines. He's often watching as the play develops and comes over to help. With his insane athleticism and reach, he can effectively be almost anywhere on the court without needing to expend additional energy going 1v1.  There was a play, for example, where he came from the weakside to block Jeff Green at the rim. It wasn't his man but he could be there to alter the play.    It helps because it allows him to converse energy and offensive players always have the thought that Giannis is somewhere lurking nearby to contest/deny the shot."
Tbf jeff green was mister inconsistent a couple years ago. He kind of revitalized his career these last couple. I loved him on the rockets.
Jeff Green has had a very under the radar playoff career
"A play is not “throw it to Giannis in the low post” that’s the exact iso ball that Bud goes to for god knows why, when the other team goes on a run.   Watch how Giannis and the bucks played in the first half as compared to late in the 3rd quarter. Bud refused to call a timeout until the lead was down to 8. What does he draw up out of the timeout? A couple dribble handoffs at the top of the key and an iso midrange broken play that results in Lopez taking a runner from the free throw line.  That was the entire second half. They didn’t even start giving Giannis the ball in the low post against Jeff Green until late in the 4th quarter."
"KD: I miss Steph Curry  Jeff Green: Say no more, fam."
"If Joe Harris went 7-for-8 from three no one bats an eye. Jeff Green does it, and everyone loses their minds."
He's also great when Jeff Green is the second best player
He is only 26 years old and it took a career night from Jeff green and historic night from KD to barely beat us.   You people don’t make sense and are just looking for a reason to hate. Which is never good. I honestly feel sorry for people like you.
"it does tho, jeff green is not gonna go 7/8 from deep every game"
"Miami  This game was close while on the road- with Jeff Green going 7/8 from 3, Blake going 7/11, and Durant having a top 3-5 playoff game all time  2 out of those 3 probably aren't happening in game 6 in Mil"
Jeff Green was playing “center” when Blake was not on the floor. Think about that.
Either Jeff Green or Blake tonight were much better than the 2nd best Cavalier in Klove who shot 9/20 FGs 1/8 from 3. Both Jeff Green and Blake were KD's teammates.   Even a trash game from Harden is a good playmaker and made 3 FTs. Even just the FTs contribution would've helped LeBron that game.   Stop acting like KD tonight played a harder game than that 51-pt LeBron game.   Even KD would be offended if you tell him straight up this Bucks = 2018 Warriors
"That’s not the question because you were still leading going into the 4th. I named 3 players KD, Harden and Jeff Green. And I said Harden played poorly. How does that imply defense at all?  You lost it in the 3rd because you gave up a sizable lead let it get into your head and scored less than either of the first 3 quarters in the 4th. That’s part of choking."
Surprisingly cool to see KD and Jeff Green go off for the same team
Jeff Green didn't do shit lol
"Ah yes the super team of KD, 32-year Blake Griffin and 35-ear old Jeff Green.  I feel your pain dude. We went to back to back NBA finals..and lost."
"I have to put it above Brons game 6 if we talking basketball.   Story wise though Brons game 6 is ahead of it. Both hard carried the FUCK out of their teams. I just think KD carried a bit harder, and did pretty much everything, while Harden was an active liability and Kyrie wasn’t there. Even when Bosh and Wade weren’t shooting well they were both really good defensively.   Comparatively Jeff Green stepped up in a way no heat player did offensively. Miami outside or Bron couldn’t do much on the offensive end. And it was an elimination game too.   If I take in other factors like the narrative of the league and the off the court implications I’d rate Brons higher. But in terms of just pure hooping it’s an all time great game that really only Top 5 tier players have pulled off in the playoffs."
Forget Kevin Durant I’d just take him being Jeff Green for a second
I didn't see Harden playing to give them another ballhandler &amp; Jeff Green morphing into Klay Thompson.
He doesn’t want to get fouled. The nets were fouling Giannis if he got in close Jeff green did it
"Instead of Giannis on the perimeter, maybe they try bringing him down in the post to help pickup and contest KD on the pick and roll  They really don't need to change much- people are over reacting   It took KD having a top 3 playoff game all time, Blake going 7/11, and Jeff Green going 7/8 from 3 to win  What are the odds 2 of those 3 will happen again in Milwaukee?"
MR.  JEFF.  GREEN.
They were not “near elite” the only player that helped him tonight was Jeff Green. The Bucks pretty much lost to KD and Jeff. One all time player and a role player and they choked the game after being up sixteen.
"Even with a crazy Jeff Green outlier, they only matched the 3 point efficiency of the bucks. I guess I mean to say — they didn’t win this game because of random lucky 3’s. This was KD putting his team on his back when their back was against the wall — caveating this performance with Jeff Green’s numbers is almost disrespectful to the game we just watched lol"
im more mad at bud for keeping brook in when Jeff Green turned into Klay mother fucking Thompson
"Easy to do that when you have harden, blake griffin, jeff green and a solid bench . fraud"
2 of those shots were prayers when the game was over. Compared to Jrue and Giannis he was okay. And he was getting guarded by KD not one leg Harden or Jeff Green
"Did not get the job done? What do you want him to do, drop 100 points like Wilt? It's not his fault that Bud let KD destroy Lopez a million straight plays. It's not his fault Jeff Green turned into Klay Thompson. He dropped 34/14/4 and played great help defense. That's about as much as you can ask out of anyone."
Also he had brook guarding Jeff green the entire game when that was clearly not a good matchup
Jeff green and Blake dropped like 60 ya doofus
"Nah if you go back and watch it you’ll see Jeff Green leave his feet to contest Middleton. I think it would’ve been a tough layup or possibly a foul best case for the Bucks there. Giannis was wide open and with Green contesting Middleton there was literally no one else down low to stop Giannis. Also it was a good pass that hit him right in the hands, dude just botched it (sums up his 4th quarter pretty well)"
"Jeff Green was the reason this game wasn't over in the first half. We really should've been down 30 pts at halftime, even with KD balling. An absolutely clutch performance, as opposed to fucking choke artist Joe Harris"
"which is why the Nets decided to play Harden as many minutes as he did despite him not being himself.  Number one guy today was KD by far for obvious reasons, but Harden was probably top 3 most important with Jeff Green."
"Lebron was also playing against a way better team, on the road, and didn’t get 27 points on near perfect shooting from Jeff Green. Not to mention even though he played bad, Harden as a decoy is still more valuable than JR Smith and George Hill. Both incredible performances but Lebron’s was more impressive"
"Best player in the universe when you have harden, blake griffin , jeff green and solid role players."
Underrated performance by Jeff Green is more like it
whether jeff green hit his shots or not is irrelevant to the performances of lebron james and kevin durant
"I mean there are a lot of larger philosophical issues, but Bud is the biggest culprit. Once it was clear Harden was at about 50%, the Bucks should have been getting the ball out of KD's hands in the 4th with traps, hard doubles, anything. Make Harden or Shamet or aging Blake make plays. You can't let Durant just own every possession, particularly if you're taking Tucker off him and giving him the chance to attack Brook Lopez possession over possession. That wasn't even a hard 49, he was getting almost every shot look he could want most of the second half.  Brooklyn's second best player tonight was Jeff Green. You have to make everyone else beat you."
He'd backed down jeff green not long earlier. harden has a hamstring on its last legs. Idgaf about skill use that 6-11 240lbs frame and put the ball and whoevers in your way in the basket ffs
The Jeff Green redemption arc the past year and a half has been so beautiful to see.
"There was a possession with a few minutes left where he just bullied Jeff Green and got an easy layup. Then for some reason, he didn't try it again. He's got a hobbled Harden on him (who isn't a good defender when 100%) and he fadeaways and bricks it. I'm sure it will come with experience, but I don't understand what he was thinking."
KD was lining up anyone in his way.  Harden being on the floor was enough to keep the antlered opponent confused.  Jeff Green said he's not going home.  Blake said what Jeff said.
"Yeah KD turned into 2018 Playoffs Bron, both their second best players were Jeff Green"
Jeff Green went 7/8 on threes.
"Bud.   - Giannis should have been on KD all night long. KD probably still has a good game, but not a 49 pt triple double. That’s a Bud call.   - PJ Tucker played for 33 minutes and scored 0 points while KD and Jeff Green set them on fucking fire. If he’s out there for his defense he didn’t fucking play any. Bobby Portis could have let KD throw down 49 too and he probably would have scored more than 0 points.   - Jrue played for only 34 minutes. Giannis and Khris each played 40+. Why? Because Bud is a moron.   Giannis made some real dumb decisions, but Bud is the one making the schemes and matchups."
"This team has to have the worst offensive IQ of any team this playoffs. I've never seen a team that plays into what works for 2 quarters and build a big lead just to default to iso the next half. Jrue and Khris were taking the worst isos of all time acting like they were prime Kobe and Tmac. Giannis was playing smart the first half by handing the ball off, setting good screens, and not being baited into taking 3's just to fall back into that and fadeaway jumpers. Almost forgot this man's hands turned to stone when he had an open dunk attempt.   Bud needs to be fired no matter what. I've never seen a coach for a ""contender"" make so few adjustments in a game This man saw KD cooking players one-on-one with Brook playing in the paint and just kept watching it happen like KD was just gonna forget how to play. These boys really had a double digit lead in the first half and got cooked by Jeff Green and Kevin Durant. I'm sick."
It's a pity KD miss the last FT to hit 50. Shout out to Jeff Green as well
Damn Jeff Green with 27 and doing work on Giannis defensively.
"So you don’t think letting Brook Lopez get cooked in the pick and roll then having him guard Jeff green wasn’t completely his fault? How is it not the coaches fault for leaving a 5 out on offense that can’t space the floor or run a play?  Lebron overruled Blatt by getting him fired, Giannis should do the same"
The worst plays today were either Giannis comically driving into Jeff Green after frantically asking for the ball.  &amp;#x200B;  Or Bud drawing up a play for Middleton to shoot a deep three off the catch when their down four with 11 seconds left.
"Nets gotta be glad they got a member of their Big 3 back from injury, they just don't operate without Jeff Green"
"KD is so fucking good. and I know he's had his ups and downs but I love Jeff Green, returned from an open heart surgery and is balling and overcame a 2v8 today"
With Jeff Green being shouting “and I helped too” in the background.
Not really Nets outside of KD aren’t a great team (with injuries). Harden was pretty awful. Jeff green stepped up. Still 21 points in the 4th isn’t consistent. That’s choking.
They stopped doubling KD because Jeff green was going off. Amazing what happens when role players PLAY THEIR FUCKING ROLE. Nets in 6.
"Ah yes just as well all expected the Nets Big 3 KD, Jeff Green and Blake Griffin getting the win."
"Legendary performances by Durant and Jeff Green.  Game 1 was the best game ive ever seen Blake Griffin play.  Game 5 was the best game ive ever seen Jeff Green play.  Side note though, ive watched a lot of Nets this year, and this series has been 5 of the worst games Joe Harris has played. Hes been so bad at the rim and from 3. If Harris was on, these games would look very different."
Giannis out there punking out fr…he’s bigger and stronger than all these players. Therefore he gots to be more aggressive or this series is over. And KD is straight up the best scorer ever. That man will find ways to score no matter what.  Edit: Jeff Green was the X factor
"Bucks don't really have a playmaker, and Bud didn't call any plays down the stretch, or give any direction on how the team should go. They got Brook Lopez and Giannis, and Brooklyn got KD and fucking Jeff Green, yet they chose to put the ball in Jrue or Middleton's hands. Just horrible coaching"
Giannis needs to guard KD man. Also shutout to Jeff Green. His performance is gonna get lost in all this but he really kept them in it with his shooting
"I dunno why he didn’t just keep going to that post up on Jeff green , he was going bucket for bucket with KD for a bit there , and then they kind of just forgot about it"
"No but it almost sounds like you're scape-goating responsibility for this game because KD and Jeff Green had career playoff games...like dude, there were a LOT of reasons why they went off and why the game was as close as it was when it never should have been after the first quarter...that is mostly on the Bucks."
"He's against playoff chokers with a terrible coach, not a dynasty with 2 top 20 players, a DPOY contender and great playmaker in Dray and the best 2-way role player in the league in Klay.  Jeff Green + Blake tonight &gt; Entire Cavs support that game"
*If Jeff Green played like he did today   Uncle Jeff can and will destroy you
There’s always a Jeff Green game
Jeff Green getting paid minimum to carry Lebron and Durant now smh
"Shoutout to Jeff Green, his spacing is so critical to the nets."
That’s a tip of the cap to KD tonight. Him never missing a shot really got to the Bucks heads and carried his team with Jeff Green filling in a Robin to KDs Batman.
Jeff green 27 pts   Killer from 3 tonight
"He didn’t score, but the maturity and leadership on the floor was required. Kudos to Jeff Green as well for doing Joe Harris’s job and providing leadership."
Running straight towards Jeff Green was laughable as well. Telegraph received
The play that sums up the Giannis experience tonight happened with like 4 minutes left. Giannis is ALREADY spinning his wheels just waiting to get the ball at the top of the key so he can iso drive on Jeff Green. He’s like an overly excited puppy ready to chase a tennis ball.   Then he committed a charge.   It’s unbelievable.
Green was huge today  I also can't help but note that he has a face that looks anywhere between 25 and 65 years old haha - truly befitting the name Uncle Jeff
"I've always loved Jeff Green, in the 2018 ECF game 7 Green started when Love was injured (again) and helped get us to the finals. I hope he wins this year"
Jeff green was such a fun addition on the rockets
I didn't expect the big 2 of Nets to be KD and JEFF GREEN
"With no Kyrie and a hobbled Harden you are. This team is struggling against the bucks who are, as this game proved, the dumbest team in basketball. There’s no way that Jeff green goes 7-8 again and without that nets lose."
James Harden clutched his hamstring so Jeff Green could walk.
Our NBA Defensive MVP and 1st team All NBA defender was guarding Joe Harris and Jeff Green as KD almost dropped 50.  I just don’t get it.
Snake had a good game. Not sure what the bucks were doing. Giannis was feasting on Jeff Green everytime they were matched up on the block. They should've tried to look for that more and also attack the mismatch whenever Joe harris was on him. Instead Middleton and Jrue thinks they are Snake and takes iso contested jumpers over and over again. Giannis also played not great down the stretch.
"Not to mention taking Jrue Holiday out of the game on the defensive end. If harden isn’t there, who’s Jrue gonna take? Jeff Green ain’t scoring 26 if he was free to guard him."
Why didn't they double him?  Jeff Green started 7/7 from 3. Then you've got Harden standing at the 3 point line.  You've got Blake who was 7/11and 3/6 from 3 point  The Nets team was on fire. And you want to give them open looks?
That and KD not missing a shot. Oh and also Jeff Fucking Green went 7/8 from 3. That's when I knew Bucks were done
LeBron didn’t have a player like Harden or Jeff green score almost 30 either lol also played arguably the greatest team ever.
There’s always a Jeff Green game
"no it doesn't because lebron isn't the reason they lost  if jeff green had this performance in 2018 finals G1 instead of today, you'd be saying the opposite. jeff green hitting open shots is the difference in who is considered to have the better game"
I agree   It's a disgrace KD &amp; Jeff Green are allowed to be on the same team
Not really. They were pretty bad. Kevin Love didn’t even play in game 6 and 7. Jeff Green was their second best player lmfao
"Suns and Nets are the only teams I'd debate about whether to start Hunter, and that'd be over Jeff Green and Crowder. I'd start him on the Jazz, he's exactly what they need. Maybe I wouldn't start him on the Warriors next year if Wiseman is good."
Well a year and a half. And Jokic is only a couple months younger than Giannis who is less than a year younger than Embiid who is less than a year younger than Beal who is a year younger than Gobert who is a year younger than Kawhi who is a year younger than Dame who is a year younger than Harden who is a year younger than Durant who is a year younger than Conley who is a year younger than Jeff Green who is a year younger than Chris Paul who is a few month younger than LeBron. You have to pick a cutoff a some point unless you're just ranking the whole league.
You can actually take it all the way back to Gary Payton.   Payton -&gt; Ray Allen -&gt; Jeff Green -&gt; Kendrick Perkins -&gt; Kanter -&gt; Melo -&gt; Schroder -&gt; Danny Green -&gt; Al -&gt; Kemba
And Jeff Green!
"Not even that, Brook became a liability on defense when he kept leaving Jeff Green and Blake open. If Jeff Green was actually defended properly (by taking Brook’s slow ass out of the lineup), we could’ve won handily.  Not to mention they were doubling bum thigh Harden instead of trapping Kevin mfing Durant.  And don’t get me started on how it seemed like he forgot to call plays in the 4th"

"As someone else pointed out, which I agree with. I think playing like that for most of the game would tire Giannis out. Or put him in foul trouble (as he’s sure to get some offensive fouls).   The counter to that is to also let KD bring the ball up, which he already does a fair amount of times. If you then ask Giannis to play full court to deny him even more, again it’s tiring Giannis out. Tired Giannis would affect the Bucks offense, as he’s not generating open looks for his teammates, then it turns into Bucks iso again.   I think the best point is it isn’t needed at all for Giannis to guard him against this Nets team. KD’s crazy game the other night should’ve been a loss, Bucks just forgot how to play offense (iso iso iso iso), while they had a considerable lead. Even with Jeff Green going off, the Bucks still should have won that game. I think the biggest reason to not put Giannis on him is that they don’t need too. Let KD do what he does, who else on the Nets can help him?"
Then who's going to protect the rim. Jeff Green?
"What on earth have we seen from KD to say he's not cold blooded?? The guy JUST played 48 minutes and scored almost 50 in a must win where Jeff Green was his best teammate. MVP. Finals MVP. Hit a dagger in Lebron's eye in the finals.  I don't particularly like the guy either but if he's not cold blooded as a competitor, no one is."
KD can go nuclear all he wants.  It’s a Jeff Green that can’t go for 30 also or Bucks lose.
"Which is crazy considering he’s 33 years old in his first year back from a torn Achilles and playing 44 minutes per game in the series while his team runs a 6 man rotation consisting of himself, 1 legged Harden, 34 year old Jeff Green, the ghost of Blake Griffin, Joe Harris with the 3 point accuracy of Shaq, and Landry Shamet. The Nets are a superteam on paper and when healthy, but in reality this is KD doing something nobody expected him to even be physically capable of trying to carry a roster which is literally half crippled into the conference finals."
Did you watch that guy dunk over Jeff Green? That is kinda the thing right there lol
"Middleton saw that Jeff Green scored 27 last game and thought he was still on the Celtics, a valid reason to release the Celtic-hating Middleton"
lol imagine having Jeff Green as your rim protector against Giannis dunks
"I think he would have if it was any other player. I've seen Giannis talk to Jeff Green in-game way more than he does with most players, he definitely likes him"
Standard-issued Jeff Green once in a while all-star games.
your favorite player jeff green?
Yeah Jeff Green came out of fucking nowhere game 5
You did watch game 5 right?. A super game by Jeff green and KD just about won them the game with the bucks up by+17 at some point. It took an epic collapse by the bucks and I think today they showed they can stop that in the future.
"This take is so fucking wild. If the Nets get a rim running center to play for them, I like Milwaukee in the matchup more. If Milwaukee can put Lopez on a big who doesn't have shooting threat they're happy, point blank, everytime. Jeff Green just scored 27 exploiting Lopez' drop for 3s. Now he won't always be that hot but to watch this series and actually think that the Nets' problem is they don't have a big is just terrible analysis. This is a recovering Harden and an injured Kyrie, and they're still carving the Bucks up well. Just so wild to see this."
"Yeah let's completely ignore Jeff Green becoming klay in game 5, bucks would've been waiting for their next opponent if green didn't show up."
Khris was reminded he was playing against Green.  Nets should hide Jeff next game.
"Well if he sucks and you guys lose, then his ass is probably getting traded this offseason.   In any event, you guys should try and get a rim-running, rim-protecting center, like Gobert is for the Jazz or Ayton is for the Suns, or what Capela was for Harden on the Rockets.   The 5 out lineup with Jeff Green at center was destroyed today, I know it's largely been successful, but playoffs are all about options, and in this specific matchup, I actually think it'd be better to play big against the Bucks than play small, make them keep Brook out there. Sometimes I wonder if 4 out + rim runner is superior on offense to 5 out because ultimately you need to have a threat at the rim to be a dominant offense."
Lmao if Harden and Kyrie never got injured (not to mention Jeff Green didn’t even play in the first 3 games of the series) the Bucks would’ve got swept or lose in 5 max
Incoming 40 point game from Jeff Green
And he played 40 minutes tonight   The main difference is Jeff Green had 5 instead of 27   The bucks folded game 5 but this series would be over rn if Jeff Green didn’t explode   And the series will be over if the only person to manage 25+ is KD
"Unless game 5 Jeff Green shows up then idk where else the offense comes from. Harden is severely limited, hats off to him for gutting it out but he’s nowhere near his normal self. The Nets need someone(s) else to step up besides KD to give them a shot, be it Harris, Green, Griffin or whoever but KD and 50% Harden can’t do it themselves."
"Watch him show up in game 7 and have the Jeff Green Game, a la Game 5. Feels like he is due for a breakout.   If not, big yikes, because he doesn’t offer anything else."
I told everybody KD wouldn't have another legendary game combining with Jeff Green going 7/8 from 3. That's why the Bucks should have been happy with game 5. Because it took 2 crazy things for the Nets to barely win
He was supposed to do what Jeff Green did in game 5
Blake Griffin also made a deal with devil to get a game back from father time and Jeff Green scored 27. It took the stars aligning for that to happen. Not saying it can't happen again but the odds are actually stacked against KD.
Probably. The Nets have zero offense besides KD. He has to have another superhuman night and one of the role players has to go ballistic like Jeff Green did in game 5.
He just thought Jeff Green was wearing a different uniform
Seeing how easy it is for Giannis to just blow by Jeff Green makes when he settles for terrible midranges even more frustrating
See what happens when Jeff Green doesnt carry this team? He cant win with these cats.
"I can't believe that the win condition for the healthy Bucks team is,   Control durant and that Jeff Green won't shoot lights out every game      Given that the nets have an injured kyrie and hobbled harden.    Jeesh bucks."
"Jeff Green was hurt until game 4 and was ok but blowout loss, insane in game 5 yea but terrible tn  Bruce Brown didn't really do much iirc other than that one open 3 he nailed  Claxton is just not ready he gets bodied too hard. Hopefully the Nets this offseason get a good defensive FA to help ease the load off him Green and Blake"
5 points by jeff green tonight. The nets were truly blessed by the basketball gods for that performance he put on in game 5. This series should have been over tonight.
Dude saw former Celtics guy Jeff Green and went off.
Someone told him that Jeff Green was a Celtic and Khris was out for blood
Bucks. They lost by few points from KD best game ever and Jeff Green 27 pts lol. Those two wont repeat that again
The only role player who is shooting poorly this series is Joe Harris. Jeff Green is doing bad this game and Bruce Brown had that one poor decision on game 3. Shamet needs to get more kick outs and corner 3 opportunities. Claxton should have been experimented with more.
KD hasn't been going god-mode and jeff green didn't put up 27.  Also giannis seemed to be settling for step-back Js a little less.
And for Jeff Green to become a all nba level player
He could get away with 49 if Jeff Green drops 27 points on 11 shots out of nowhere.
"this is gonna be a weird game 7. Think the Bucks are going to take it short of another signature game from KD, he doesn't have enough help with Harden hurt. The chances of someone pitching in with 27 points like Jeff Green did in game 5 are slim"
"Giannis following up the murder of Jeff Green with ""let me brick this midrange because I can't post a smaller guy into oblivion"""
KD just can't win without his co-star Jeff Green carrying him
Friendly reminder that the reason this series isn’t over is that Kevin Durant and Jeff fucking Green outplayed the entire bucks roster by themselves in game 5 with no Kyrie and useless Harden.
Jeff Green turned into Jeff Green tonight
Shaq and Chuck are probably watching on proudly. Giannis treating Jeff Green like barbecue chicken.
Jeff Green has a career night and KD goes nuclear. Won’t happen twice in a row. Now it’s just about who shows up in Game 7
the duality of Jeff Green is splendid
"GOT DAMN, Jeff Green has to fight him on principle"
I wanna be mad at Jeff green but this is the epitome of his whole career. A bad game following a good one
Bud is brain dead. That decision to keep giannis on jeff green? Why??? Give me one reason that's a better option than giannis on KD. On the few possessions he's been on kd it's worked great for the bucks. What is bud thinking?
Jeff Green spent all his power last game. That’s the trademark “one off amazing” game that role players get each postseason
If bud keeps giannis on jeff green he's out of a job lol. Every possession so far when he's contested kd in this 4th has been good
"Jeff Green isn't the best or flashiest player but damn, I really respect that dude. He doesn't do anything great but he's just a solid all-around vet, especially defensively."
Jeff Green walloped him on the 1st shot. Was just a delayed call. Surely nets fans know about delayed calls...
But he never does. He just stands there near Jeff Green doing nothing.
Damn refs giving out a foul so Giannis doesn't get embarrassed for getting blocked while clocking Jeff Green in the chin
"Jeff green, totally fine, faking an injury"
How the fuck in fuckity fuck fuck could that be a fucking foul on Jeff Green?!?!
I’m surpised Jeff green ain’t punch Giannis yet for the amount of elbows he caught from him
how the fuck was that a foul on Jeff Green and not a travel or a foul on Giannis
"Jeff green on the ground in pain from being hit, called for the foul"
How is that a foul on Jeff Green? They do not call nearly enough offensive fouls on Giannis
foul on jeff green? hahaha
Why is Giannis guarding Jeff Green who never moves on offense? It's a waste of you all pro defensive star. Put him on kd
"Harden cannot be touched, but they're completely fine with Jeff Green getting battered"
Jeff Green with the clear hit on giannis wrist but this subreddir will just choose to ignore that
A foul on Jeff green lmaoooo
Jeff green clearly head butted his elbow
Jeff Green has been taking a beating
Time for them to whip out Jeff “Curry” Green
In the Jeff Green role tonight… James Harden!
Giannis is just abusing Jeff Green.
There goes the rest of Jeff Green miracle juice
"&gt; The Texan's owner is super-religious so his guy is a pastor. Cuban's ""language"" is cutting edge number-crunching and tech, so his guy is a crypto-enthusiast and gambler.  What's funny is that the Texans regressed this year and Dallas haven't won a series in a decade.  I get the need to use analytics but it seems like in basketball every year there is a random ""where did this come from"" game from a role player that you can't predict in any model (Jeff Green getting hot from 3, Lou Williams going off last night, Cameron Payne playing well against the Lakers).  Or a random injury that takes a guy out in a pivotal moment.  Sometimes you just have to be able to live in the moment and go with the hot hand and not be so married to analytics and metrics.  I feel like basketball is the ultimate momentum game.  Sometimes the snowball gets moving and just can't be stopped.    Basically what [KD said years ago](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1184140634208329728)"
Give KD a breather and sub in Jeff Green!
An entire quarter of Jeff Green.  MY EEEYYYYEEESSS!!!
Elbow to Jeff Green but Giannis gets to go to the line??
"every time Jeff Green scores he has that ""fine, I'll do it myself"" old man energy"
Jeff Green is straight up not having a good time.
Can anyone tell me what kind of shoes Jeff Green is wearing
Jeff Green I swear to god someone offer this guy $12 million to get him off the Nets.
As someone that started watching ball in the late 2000s I find it wholesome seeing Harden/KD/Jeff Green all playing together again
 Giannis is feasting on Jeff Green rn
I would way rather have a Jeff green three than kd 1 on 1 vs kris Middleton
uhhhh does jeff green think he has 5 fouls or something already? what was the D by Green?
KD played like a goat last game but to me Jeff Green is the one that started the comeback… His threes gave the team confidence…
Jeff Green is going to miss a lot tonight
Jeff Green after a good game is a liability
Jeff Green is the best 8th man in the NBA.  Whatever that means.
Today you guys are gonna realize why jeff green is always getting paid a minimum contract. He so inconsistent
The unfortunate truth of Jeff Green
Jeff green remembered he’s actually a bum
Jeff Green remembered he is a mediocre shooter
"Considering how much the big 3 were injured in the regular season, how tf did Nash *not* exceed expectations? 0 playoff adjustments? Are we watching the same game? Aside from maybe inserting Jeff Green over Joe Harris in game 7, what else do you expect Nash to do?"
i dont remember jeff green hitting 7/8 threes for lebron. He had nothing that serious and even jeff greens shots were assisted by lebron. Kd has playmakers
Gassed from guarding jrue or middleton. Jeff green should’ve had more minutes
"They should have got Andre Drummond while they had the opportunity.  He's from nearby in Mt Vernon.  He is a must sign in the offseason.  Why didn't Jeff Green get more time to contribute?  I have a feeling if he did,  the outcome would have been different."
Joe Harris was in for defensive reasons. He matches up much better with Middleton and Jruei who almost exclusively targeted Shamet when he was on the floor. I think the right substitution would've been Jeff Green for Joe Harris given how poorly Harris played.
"I’m looking at Jeff Green and if he’d crashed the boards, the ball would have went right into his hands for an easy put back to tie the game.  Even on a miss, they could have had a chance.  Wow."
"Jeff Green Game 7 against Boston. Eerily similar to Game 5 against the Bucks.   And he didn’t repeat any of those performances. Great playmakers need surrounding players to hit shots, surprise"
"Harden at least was able to play as a decoy, could still draw fouls and acted as a facilitator. People move the goal posts on LeBron so often that it almost underrates him.   That 06-07 Cavs team:  LeBron (22 years old) Big Z Anderson Verajao Drew Gooden Daniel Gibson Sasha Pavlovic Eric Snow Ira Newble  20-21 Brooklyn KD Harden Kyrie (yes, he played in 2.5 games) Jeff Green Blake Griffin Joe Harris Brown DeAndre Jordan (IDK why he didn’t get any run)  You can’t **possibly** tell me that these teams are in any way comparable. KD and LeBron, maybe they’re a wash, but KD is 10 years LeBron’s senior on this series. So you trade athleticism for experience.  A hurt Harden is better than anyone else on those Cavs. 2.5 games of Kyrie is better than anyone on those Cavs. Jeff Green is better and more complementary than anyone of those Cavs. Blake Griffin at this age is better than anyone of those Cavs. Joe Harris is a 48% regular season 3PT shooter. Him choking in this series has not merit on the fact that if current him was on that Cavs team, he would have been an asset.  And no disrespect to KD, he was masterful this series. But LeBron’s Cavs **won** against a team that had been the ECF champions for several consecutive seasons."
"They’ll get a ring chaser or two in the offseason. I think Dinwidide is gone because he wouldn’t have a role in the closing lineup. Brown needs to get paid and I have to imagine someone will offer him $8-$10 million if not more. Blake already gave up $13 million to come to the Nets, but I think there’s a chance he re-signs for the minimum.   It’s a big sacrifice though because playing on the minimum for multiple years seems to impact future contract offers (see Jeff Green). Plus he’s got an extensive injury history. The Nets can’t offer him more than the minimum. Jeff Green has not had many big contract years and some team might be willing to throw $6-$9 million at him. Be interesting if he re-signs for the minimum as well."
https://youtu.be/TCoCdImJHxk  I still hate Jeff Green for ruining my 2010 MLK Holiday /s
"Blake's salary is being paid by pistons basically, no need to worry about him, around a min. Jeff green should come back for a min, he's ring chasing now. Dinwiddie the real question mark? Whether their owner willing to pay"
Was Harden not on the court? Blake Griffin? Joe Harris? Jeff Green? Weren't they getting hyped up all year? Now they're bums? Or is it just that KDisney can't do anything without 2 superstars on his team?
"Let's make this simple. If all 3 are playing and Joe Harris is Joe Harris from the regular season, BRKLYN sweeps with ease or at WORST wins 4-1.  Also, I know it's his first gig but I just don't trust Nash as my coach. And D'antoni can't be my main assistant.  , no way no how. Two of the main coaches that no nothing about defense. Nash's rotation during this series seemed lackluster. First 2 games it felt like everyone played. The last 5 games it felt like 6 or 7ish players played. It's one thing to cut your rotation but to rely on your rotation to be held down by Jeff Green for the past few games is somewhat weak. Sure Green had a great game once and some decent games overall but you need someone in there to make the Bucks THINK once about going to the rim.   Giannis got to the rim at will. Middleton got to the rim (not to the rim but got deep in the lane and shot the short jumper). Jrue got to the rim in early games. Rebounding was terrible as well for the most part. Can't tell me that Claxton and Jordan couldn't at least get 10 rbs together?   Where was James, Shamet the last two games?   Then for the offense to dwindle down to Durant at the top going 1on1 at the end of qtrs is lame. It's always been lame for teams to do that. Just run your regular set unless its less than 15 seconds left.   Bucks played a good series. Hit the shots when they counted the most and had some pretty long dry periods. Overall though, good series but neither team played their best. Individual players had great games but thats about it.   If Kawhi comes back at full strength I think the Clippers will win it all. Outside of that, Philly has as good a chance as anyone left. Bucks if the shot better as a team can win it also."
"There’s no way of knowing that. If everyone is healthy, then Durant probably doesn’t go for 50, and all the points from Brown and Blake dry up. Same goes for that 30 piece Jeff green dropped. Who knows"
"Yeah, it was basically Harris's money, Blake who shouldn't be on a minimum, harden on one leg and Bruce brown and Jeff green as kd's supporting cast."
"I'd rather have hobbled Harden over the Top 3 players on the 2018 Cavs combined. He also had Kai for the first 3.5 games fully healthy, as well as guys like Blake and Jeff Green balling"
"To all the Nets haters. There ain’t no reason to hate on that team. Two guys deserve the blame. Joe Harris and Nash. KD left it all out there and no one can say otherwise. Dude put up two, not one, TWO all time career playoff games to keep his team in it. Harden gave it all he could too. Everyone’s going to talk about his shooting percentage and how he shouldn’t have been out there. Man, if Harden says he wants to play there is no way you wouldn’t want him on the floor, bad leg or not. Dude played 52 minutes with a leg that’s not even 50% and still put 22. Donovan played on a bad leg the other night with a lesser injury and basically put up the same kind of performance and everyone was proud of him and said “he played it heart out” but since it’s Harden everyone wants to give him a hard time. Joe Harris and Nash lost this game in my eyes. Joe not only missed the game winning 3 with quite literally no one even near him; the dude shot 3-10 (3-9 from 3pt) and yet he still played 46 minutes. Why?!? Jeff Green just put up huge numbers the other night and he sat the damn bench the whole game. He had 12 minutes and this game went to OT. Nash didn’t pull him. Bruce Brown played well early on but I don’t understand why you play him over Shamet. Bruce Brown gets the Ben Simmons treatment when he’s on offense. No one even guards him bc he’s got nothing but floaters in his game. Not to mention the play calling by the Nets down there at the end. It was just pass it to KD and see what happens.   To the Bucks fans, congrats. I don’t know how long it will last to be honest. Some will argue the 76ers might not even beat the Hawks but if they do y’all better be ready. Embiid is a whole other animal. Brook is going to have his hands full. Not to mention Seth Curry has been lighting it up from deep. I think you matchup a little bit better against the 76ers (especially with Hack a Ben still in the lineup). Otherwise if the Hawks win, we might see y’all in the finals. Suns/Clippers will be waiting on y’all and man will it be a fun Finals this year."
"Lmfao bro said Donte like you can compare him to Harden, Kyrie, or even Jeff Green"
The Jeff Green special. Has one great game and then disappears for the rest of the year lol!
"Maybe.   But KD, Harden, and Kyrie will be a year older. THere's no guarantee that they'll keep Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or Spencer Dinwiddie.   They're deep into the tax without spending a dime on any of those guys or their replacements."
I assume he means the superstars. I hope no one is randomly hating Jeff Green and Bruce Brown
"Shut the fuck up with your fake ass Superteam.  Y'all talked all that bullshit just to win one more series than the Knicks.  Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, your fucking roster is stacked as shit.  Couldn't win with 1.5 superstars? Oh boo fucking hoo"
Well Jeff Green was actually good with Bron lol he helped Bron a lot game 7 against the Celtics when love was down
"Oklahoma City would burn itself to the ground.  Durant, Harden, Westbrook, Jeff Green."
Hawks by far  Worse team on paper and Embiid is far more formidable than Blake Griffin and Jeff Green in the paint
"Funny thing is a lot of guys from that shit squad have had career resurgences since then. Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, even Larry Nance are all at least above average rotation players now"
Jeff Green has plantar fasciitis
"I’m not even a huge KD fan, but you mean the stacked roster of an obviously hobbled Harden, a shell of his former self (due to injuries) Griffin, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown and 34 year old Jeff Green?"
"Big facts, KD was unreal this whole series and had basically no help outside of 1 Jeff Green game."
KD already took 36 shots and 11 free throws are you nuts? He was 0-6 in OT because of tiredness.  Jeff Green wasnt even on the floor most of the time.  Do you people even watch the game you comment on?
Jeff Green also wasn’t injured and is on the team for 3 point shooting and laid a goose egg in 13 minutes tonight.
"Nah.  He won one game with Jeff Green playing completely out of his mind, and the Bucks pretending that James Harden was at full health and defending him like he was at 100% for some really stupid reason."
"Nets bench with ZERO shots.  2 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 fouls.  Jeff Green with 13 minutes.  Landry Shamet with 7 minutes.  Nicolas Claxton with 1 second."
What about Jeff Green? Oh wait... Goddamn Nash just get your hot shooter more minutes
So why is Jeff Green not playing 35 mins tonight? Not scared of the moment. Actually hits three's. Rebounds. Guards all positions...
Nets without kyrie? Injuried harden and jeff green?
No excuse for the nets. I don’t wanna hear injuries refs nothing. You have Jeff green joe Harris KD Blake Griffen half of harden. Stop making excuses
&gt;The Nets are going to need a lot of help for next season.  They only need time to recover. Harden isn't 100%. Kyrie got injured. Even Jeff Green just got back from plantar fascia issues.   Joe better fucking remember how to shoot tho
Jeff Green literally saved the Nets in game 5. How come he had 0 shots this game and didn't get to play more??? Also Bruce Bowen is a tough dude but he can't shoot. Idk why Nash kept going with him.
Jeff Green 12mins 0 points.
Jeff Green just ball watching smh Nets choked
"If the bucks pull this out, I blame Nash for not playing spicy Jeff green more"
Jeff green even (pre-Blake fouling out)
Jeff Green seems to be in a lot of pain. Giannis need to attack him
jeff green dagger coming
Jeff Green looks like he woke up in Hamsterdam about an hour before the game.
If Bud doesn't have Giannis attack Jeff Green any time he is on him then fire him right now
"We all know he gonna jump shoot, Joe Harris and Jeff Green are not gonna get the ball."
Jeff Green did not like being taken out there  👀
Why did Jeff Green barely play? He hasn’t had a single field goal attempt.
How is Brooke Lopez  not getting the ball under the rim with Jeff green on him
Giannis slid out to guard Jeff Green... come on... bad D decision
Jeff green balls out.  Jeff green only records fouls in stat line.
Why so little Jeff Green.
Why is Jeff Green not playing over brown ?
Jeff green about to curse the nets
JEFF GREEN BABY LES GO
Jeff Green about to go full Horry
Jeff green really can’t get in and give me 2.5 threes after dropping 27??
I’m honestly surprised they don’t have Jeff Green out there more with how well he did game 5
Jeff Green just woke up
Is Jeff Green hurt? Wheres he been
Jeff Green get reinjured or something?
Bro where is Jeff Green? What does Steve Nash even do?
Why has Jeff Green and Shamet barely got minutes
Jeff Green should probably be getting all of Harris’s minutes
"I think if you’re the Bucks you have to keep pounding inside to Giannis.  He’ll miss a lot of free throws, but if he can get Blake and Jeff Green into foul trouble, he’ll force Steve Nash to put in guys he doesn’t want to.  Right now that seems like the Bucks only hope."
Joe Harris is on Bertans level this series. Bruce Brown seriously need to learn to shoot mid range jumpers this offseason. Is there a reason why Jeff Green played only 2 mins?
Worse case Jeff Green is 6 fouls on Giannis for hopefully 12 free throws.  That would be a successful game from him.
The smartest move by Nash? Bring in Jeff Green to make sure Giannis doesn’t get to the rim and use his fouls throughout the end of the first half and end of game lol
"Uh, this is the 2nd time Jeff Green has been in the game. Is Marv actually going senile?"
Ayo where Jeff green?
yo are we seriously not playing jeff green? did we seriously cut our rotation to 6 people? wtf nash
"PLAY JEFF GREEN, NASH OMG"
WHY Jeff Green for only 10 fucking seconds man
I love that Jeff green went off and is now completely irrelevant lmfao
Jeff Green the daddy
Surprised Jeff Green just coming in
Where Jeff Green tho? Asking for my Fan Duel account
Jeff Green could do what he’s doing rn. Brown made that great save and some D stops but his offense is a liability. He’s just in the right spot on some of the rebounds rn.
No Jeff Green?
Is jeff green injured?
Is Jeff green playing?
"Genuine question, why hasn’t uncle Jeff Green touched the floor??"
No Kyrie and no Jeff Green for Nets. That sucks
PLAY JEFF GREEN WTF
I am assuming Jeff Green is hurt?
Where is Jeff Green?
Is Jeff Green injured ? Thought he’s usually a key part of the rotation.
When does Jeff Green come in?
Bring Jeff Green in already
Is Jeff Green injured or what?
"The thing I hate most are the fraudulent and gimmicky defensive schemes that force ""role player"" to beat you with wide open shots while you lazily cover the other players. Sometimes, you're lucky and the role player bricks most of them.   A lot of times, you get exactly what's coming to you (Iguadola torching the Rockets in that Game 6, Dort torching the Rockets in that game 7 last year despite them winning anyway, Jeff Green in Game 5 for the Bucks/Nets, Mann in this game 6, etc.).   It's just lazy and highly suspectible to unpredictable variance, especially in postseason games, let alone an elimation game. ."
They also have to hope that Joe Harris wakes up from that coma before game time and that Jeff Green is Mr. Hyde tonight.
Durant will drop  40 10 and 11 .harden will chip in with 20 or more  points And at least 10 . Expecting nets to go hot from 3 and maybe double Gianni's. Joe Harris will rebound but I am expecting Jeff green to continue to ball out
"Not even that we won’t shoot that bad, because we might! I just don’t expect Jeff green to go 7 for 8 from 3 again! That was an outlier game; I just hope the refs don’t reward James floppin for his dives. That will be the most detrimental thing for our team!"
"We tried Jeff Green, but he was awful."
"Honestly if Jeff Green doesn't have his once a year amazing game for game 5 then this series is probably over. Dude had 5 games over 20 points and a high of 23 for the season. Scores 27 in game 5 for more points than all of his other playoff games this year combined..   My initial thought for that game was *if it took Jeff Green going off to stay in and win it*, then I don't see how the Nets can honestly have the advantage the rest of the series, especially if Harden remains injured and can't play like himself.  I don't care who wins, but there's a good chance the Bucks play well and beat the Nets. Outside of KD (if Harden is still limping around out there), who is going to do anything? It'll take another otherworldly game from a bench/role player.."
The key to winning the NBA has somehow become where you need a guy like Jeff Green on the Nets going 7/8 from 3 in Game 5 or Mann on the Clippers going 7/10 from 3 in game 6.  If the Nets win it will probably end up being because Joe Harris finally gets hot and makes 6+ threes.
If the big 3 was fully healthy I would agree but its basically the big 1.5 at this point lol. Also aside from Blake and Jeff Green in game 5 all the role players are pretty lackluster including Joe Harris who went from shooting 50% in the regular season from 3 to like 20-30  Ill give you props if you win but really from the moment Harden went down in game 1 this was the Bucks series to lose. I excused the first 2 games since The Nets are still great with Kyrie but if yall drop game 7 with this roster thats just sad. Especially with how the last 3 years played out
Jeff Green
"Celtics:   2007: 2nd best lottery odds fall to 5th lose a chance at KD  2009: 44-11 C's deal with KG injury and don't make the finals  2010: Perkins misses game 7 of finals, Refs give the Lakers 37-17 FT advantage (20 in the 4th)  2012: Lebron plays the best game of his career ending the big 3 era  2013: Rondo tears ACL, Sullinger back injury out for season  2017: IT hip injury derailed everything and the curse of IT begins  2018: Hayward injury 1st game, Kyrie out for season before playoffs, Smart out for 1st round, we have the NBA Finals in our grasp and Brown and Rozier have the worst shooting games of their career and Jeff Green goes off  2019: Tons of talent but terrible locker room because of to many me guys, Kyrie does what Kyrie always does, Kings are good for one season and pick turns to shit, Philly pays Horford a shit ton of $ he can't turn down. We sign Kemba in a panic move.   2020: Kemba knee injury, Hayward playoff injury, Tyler Herro goes nuclear in ECF, Grizzles pick turns to shit  2021: Most covid missed days in league, Smart long injury, Brown out for playoffs, Tatum Covid, Fournier gets traded and gets covid a day later, Kemba doesn't start the year healthy &amp; doesn't play back 2 backs to end up missing playoff games anyway"
"Oh ya.   Otto Porter, who I guess is always injured.   Doug McDermott will surely get offered more than the 6m we can offer and he’s trash on defense, so again you’re wing defenders are Bron, AD and Doug.   Why would Jeff Green leave the Nets?   And I’d take Melo, but as a 10th man who plays 15 min a game. Not a Kuz replacement."
"Nah Kuz gotta go too. Honestly you could replace him with guys at his position who will be cheaper like Otto Porter, Melo, McDermott, Jeff Green, Batum, etc and they’d still have a better or similar impact.   His $13M contract starts this year and I’m not a big fan of that."
"Giannis wasn't ""guarded by Blake Griffin"". The Nets were running a soft wall in the paint with KD leaving the corner shooter open to clog the paint and another Nets player in there too. He was rarely 1v1 against Blake. I don't even remember how many times Bruce Brown and Harris and Green were helping off their player, while KD was right there too and Blake was his main defender.  The Bucks weren't doubling KD though, they were letting him get his. He was always going 1v1 except for some time in game 5 when they tried it and Jeff Green torched them, so they stopped.  Ayton did guard Giannis 1v1."
Jeff Green is Thaddeus Young's backup on the All-NBA Good Team
Good luck playing the big two of KD and Jeff Green again
I wont accept the Jeff Green slander!  Green remains the most underpaid player relative to the skills he can bring to a championship contender.   https://twitter.com/dwyanewade/status/1146256817258926082?lang=en
honestly the suns didnt seem to be trying to draw charges as much outside of that one from torrey craig that i remember. jeff green/blake griffin were more brave than most of the suns team
"Where was Giannis’ help at then? Middleton had one insane game and another decent one but was obviously super streaky throughout. Jrue couldn’t hit a shot most of the time. KD definitely had help in certain games, we really gonna act like Jeff Green didn’t drop a super efficient 27? A ton of that series was on the Bucks supporting cast playing terribly for most of it"
"It’s tougher than what people realistically think. What’s their whole team going to even look like? Three max guys and Joe Harris is set, but…  Brown, Griffin, Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, and Tyler Johnson are all free agents. Not sure any of those guys resign. The bench is probably going to be razor thin or filled with older vets."
That is an insult to both Jeff Green and Target
Jeff Teague is the Target Brand Jeff Green. Disappears and is bad for weeks then has one big game.
"they have a good bench if they can keep it. Shamet, jeff green, bruce brown, claxton is a solid bench"
"Sonics got Durant and Jeff Green.  Green never became a star, so I don't think you'd call that a home run, but dude is still second in minutes and 4th in points among his draft class."
"The role players weren’t even that bad, Blake had a great series and Bruce Brown was up and down but a lot more good than bad. Jeff Green had the game of his life to help them win game 5. Joe Harris was absolutely atrocious after game 2 but just about everybody else was as good or better than you could expect them to be."
Jeff green is strictly one dimensional and if his shot doesn’t hit he’s not giving you anything. Jrue and Middleton at least provide defense consistently and they’re both better playmakers. Jeff green had 7 assists the whole series. Jrue had 19 and 8 in game 5. 21/8/5 with 4 steals in game 6. Khris had 35 and 5 in game 3. Come on man.
"This is what I’m talking about. “34 year old Jeff Green” in game 5 had a better game than any non-Giannis Bucks player at any point in the series except for Middleton in game 6, it doesn’t matter that he’s old and not that good in the first place. He showed up for that one game better than anybody on the other team.  You want to talk scoring and rebounding and playmaking load though…  KD scored 33.8% of his team’s points. Giannis scored 31.2%. KD pulled in 24.4% of his team’s rebounds. Giannis pulled in 23.6%. KD created 25.1% of team assists. Giannis created 19.8%.  These are not big differences, Giannis had all this help on paper and more often than not it turned into bricks. He was carrying, not quite as much as KD but he definitely wasn’t far off, and for all that extra talent on paper most of it didn’t show up."
"He did it in 2007(which was still a good defensive squad) and 2018(where other role players still showed up at various times, i.e. he wasn't winning game 7 against the celtics unless jeff green doesn't explode."
"Hawks would have been up 3-1 on the bucks if trae didn't get injured, and they were missing a starter too  Nets took the bucks to OT of game 7 with Kyrie, Harden, Jeff Green, and Dinwiddie missing multiple games each  The 3rd best team in the east beat the 4th best team in the west last night. Nobody cares."
"Oh, but it's fine to give it do Giannis for playing Blake, DJ, Jeff green and Joe Harris?"
TIL Jeff green and 1 legged Harden is more help than Jrue and Khris
"I don’t think you really understood the Nets issue. They had NO one to generate offense other than KD. That’s why he had to play 48 minutes a game. Jeff Green / Blake Griffin all having those big games can be credited to Durant’s playmaking(mostly, especially Jeff). Meanwhile, Giannis had his team of playmakers and shot creators."
"KD was far and away the best player on the nets (and in the series) and was forced to carry in terms of scoring, rebounding, playmaking, clutch shots. He’s the main reason they won game 5 and nearly 7. The contributions from 34 year old Jeff green and Blake Griffin no doubt helped but it’s laughable to compare Giannis’ help to KDs. Therefore it seems as if KD nearly single handidly beat the bucks."
"thats easy to say when the team team gets hurt if were being honest. while the warriors were technically a super team they were nothing like the heat or the nets. the amount of players that the nets got on top of harden was ridiculous, blake, jeff green, tyler johnson, are 3 players that were worth way more than min. curry would have loved to have players of that level in the finals vs the raptors"
"There’s an unbelievable amount of talk about “KD nearly beat the Bucks with no help” for a guy that didn’t actually win any games without help.   Game one he still had Kyrie, who was good, and Joe Harris’ one fantastic game of the series before he disappeared into the abyss. Game two was a great all-round performance from the Nets while the Bucks (including Giannis) disappeared and it’s the one real stain on Giannis’ performance this series. Game three nobody on the Nets was any good, including KD, and a couple of ok performances from Giannis and Middleton won an ugly game. That was his best chance to actually win without help, even with Kyrie there, and he had a fairly poor game.  Game four he was straight up not good and they lost again, not helped by Kyrie’s injury of course. Game five Jeff Green and Blake Griffin caught absolute fire, it was probably the best game of KD’s career and he deserves all the plaudits he gets for it but if a combined 44 points on 26 shots from those two isn’t help I don’t know what is. Game 6 they got eaten alive on the glass (not KD’s fault) and Middleton was spectacular so they dropped the game.  Then you get to game 7. A toe away from a famous win. He got a little bit of help but not anything especially noteworthy. Brown was good, Blake was good, but they weren’t exactly playing like stars. Thing is, Giannis got exactly the same. Lopez showed up, Connaughton and Tucker hit some threes, but Jrue and Middleton were **bad**. Combined 14/49 from the field bad. They both hit some clutch shots late so it didn’t seem so bad but they were absolute garbage for the majority of the game. There was not a lot of difference between their support casts, which is why it went to OT in the first place despite Giannis being phenomenal.  Seems like people are still judging this series on paper  and ignoring the realities of the series. It wasn’t KD, lone hero against an All Star big three. It was KD and Kyrie for half the series and then for the other half of the series they occasionally had role players stepping up to one degree or another, while two of the Bucks All Star big three struggled to hit a layup for most of the series and the role players were similarly inconsistent and mostly just ok."
"They are not a ""superteam"" but they are a super TEAM as in excellent cohesion.  They play so well together and I'm not sure anyone could have beaten this resilient squad.  Do not forget that KD scored 48 and 49 points and would not have posted those numbers if the Big 3 was playing he would have taken less shots.  Do not forget Blake Griffin shot over 50 percent and scored 20 ppg after Kyrie went down.  Do not forget Jeff Green went 7/8 from 3 pointers and was as good as any big 3 member in game 5 of the 2nd round.  So if the big 3 was healthy why exactly are they a lock to win??  Maybe Nets on paper they are better but are they a TEAM? Can they actually win together?  We haven't seen any proof of that even in the regular season lmaooo  Bucks win the title this season no matter what. MAYBE the Lakers could have won but I still think it's Bucks in 6 or 7.   Donte Divicenzo was an enormous loss. PJ Tucker was not close to being as good in his replacement spot. Donte is legit 3 and D AND he can rebound extremely well for a guard one of best in the game at that."
"Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan have been all stars more recently than Jrue Holiday, so by that logic KD had two all stars as well. Jeff Green had a better game than any game Jrue had in that series. Middleton wasn't even an all star this year either. Imagine talking about Giannis 'needing' anything in comparison to the dude that's only won after joining a 73-9 team lmao stop it"
giannis not being particularly efficient was disappointing because the nets didnt even have a big man to hold him in the paint  dude was guarded by dam blake and jeff green lol
They give Jeff green and shamet his minutes and shots and they win lol
"Not superstars maybe, AD isn't going to join Mitchell in Utah after seeing this, but I think it will increase low- or mid-level stars who demand a trade to be willing to let themselves be traded to smaller market teams, and I also think high-caliber starters (like Brogdon and Bojan Bogdanivic) as well as mid-level exception level players (like Portis, Jeff Green, PJ Tucker, etc) will be more incentivized to sign there knowing that if you build a strong supporting cast around two or three great players, then a single trade and a little bit of luck can have you ending up in the finals."
I mean he was 1 inch away from beating him with his next best player being Jeff green while Giannis needed 2 all stars lol
Jeff Green was coming off a foot injury too. He wasn’t playing like he usually does
"Both teams could use Jeff Green. Scratch that, all 30 teams could."
And they also forget that Jeff green was injured (nets) and LRMAM for us was injured
"Not really. Blake was huge. KD was solid. Despite what r/nba thinks Harden is actually a really good defender when he’s not playing lazy through the regular season. Kyrie stepped up huge defensively when he needed to. Claxton and Bruce Brown are both really good. Jeff Green was probably as good as KD. Fine, but Definitely not the corner stone of our defense by any means."
You could say the same for Rudy Gay who went to the Jazz  or Otto Porter Jr who went to the Warriors.  This is like the first signing Nets have done all offseason. They lost Jeff Green to the Nuggets  I haven’t seen any moves this offseason where you can say there’s a market advantage (outside of maybe Tucker)  Lowry is close to Butler  Ariza/Dwight are both laker guys  NY only got Fournier. They struck out on all the star.  Let’s calm down
Jeff Green or another switchable wing
"does Jeff Green count? I think he can be a fit on any team in the league and I mean the guys been in around almost half the league. Although I don't consider him ""worst"" not even close to it."
&gt;I feel like he's gonna take deals similar to Jeff Green or Nicolas Batum.  Pretty sure they got different deals.  Green's was reported to be 2/$10m and Batum was 2/120% of min.
He used to be good. Jeff Green has never been good
Jeff Green literally won a game for Brooklyn against us. Trevor Ariza on the other hand was a joke lol
Jeff Green got a contract before Jackson
Yeah I love Jeff Green. Would have liked to see him play with LeBron again. Agree it’s a loss to the Nets
"Ariza got destroyed in their series against the bucks, Jeff Green was actually way better"
I hope the letting Jeff Green go doesn't come around and bite Nets in the ass later. Man was super utilitarian for us...
"We didn’t want to… but I also think it was time for Jeff green to get paid.   We didn’t have bird rights and we would have had to use our TMLE to pay him. With so many holes to fill, we needed to break that up and not use it on one person.   It sucks, but I get it. Green deserves a payday finally. We wouldn’t have been able to pay him"
"Ehh not sure what people were expecting.  They brought back Blake and Brown, meaning 7 of their top 8 are back (Jeff Green is the one who isn't).   They only had the tax MLE to spend and already have a massive tax bill. Not really sure who people thought they'd get?"
Rodney hood might suck but he's talented enough that he can swing a series. He's the homeless man's version of Jeff Green who's the poor man's version of Trevor Ariza
He so washed but I think Nets can get some use out of him like a Walmart Jeff Green
man i just don’t see how he can replace Jeff Green.   i think Brooklyn really fucked up letting Green walk
He’s trying to outdo Jeff Green and play for every team in his NBA career
"I love this pickup but really hope it doesn't turn into the Jeff Green situation, who came to Utah cause of Conley and was absolute dog shit"
"Spending power via KeithSmithNBA on Twitter:  ATL - $5.9M of NTMLE   BOS - $5.9M Tax MLE or $9.5M NTMLE (pending trade)   BKN - $5.9M Tax MLE or Minimums (pending Blake)   CHA - $13.5M cap space and $4.9M Room Exception   CHI - $9.5M NTMLE (if Caruso is S&amp;T into Theis TPE)  CLE - $9.5M NTMLE   DAL - $9.5M NTMLE (if Bullock S&amp;T into Richardson TPE)   DEN - Some of MLE left (pending Jeff Green signing)   DET - $4.9M Room Exception   GSW - $5.9M Tax MLE   HOU - $9.5M NTMLE   IND - Minimums  LAC - $5.9M Tax MLE or Minimums (pending Batum)   LAL - $5.9M Tax MLE or Minimums (pending FAs)   MEM - $4.9M Room Exception   MIA - Minimums   MIL - $5.9M Tax MLE   MIN - $9.5M NTMLE  NOP - Up to $13.5M in cap space or $9.5M NTMLE (pending S&amp;Ts in/out)   NYK - $8.8M cap space   OKC - $28M cap space or stay over with TPEs.

They could have used either JaMychal or Jeff Green. I don't see the likes of top tier PFs signing with them unless they massively overpay.
"Chucky, Joe Smith, and Jim Jackson all played for the Cavs  Then, in the 11 and 10 group, there's Ollie, Boykins, Jeff Green, Mark Bryant, and Lou Amundson.."
Ish Smith is the goat journeyman  Wish Jeff Green stayed in Brooklyn tho he was really nice with them
"Philly is about to lose Green,Howard and HIll and sign Jeff Teague to the MLE just watch"
"First of all, I can't let the Jeff Green slander go unnoticed.  Homie took minimum after minimum when he probably could have had a larger deal over the past few years.  Second, basketball wise -- it's awesome seeing 3 talents like that on the court.  I personally wouldn't be surprised though if any lingering off court issues exist though.  Pure speculation, as I've said before."
Well the writing was on the wall with us signing Jeff Green and JaMychal Green earlier today.
Figured as much once they signed Jeff Green.
"Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Isaiah Thomas, Jeff Green, Richard Jefferson..."
"Idgaf about Kent Bazemore. We did nothing with the roster this last week but add a 19 year PG who had more turnovers than assists in college.   We lost Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie and will be stuck with KD’s smoke buddy DeAndre again."
Jeff Green leaving will hurt but otherwise still scary hours
Brooklyns gonna have old ass Blake doing 30 mins off the bench playing all positions lmao. Dinwiddle and jeff green gone
"They need to get a SF/PF hybrid. Like Melo, Gay, Jeff Green, Morris twins.... those type of players."
"2021 Nets, Kd, Harden, Kyrie, LMA, Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Jeff Green"
"The same article that number is pulled from ""reported"" that Portis would likely leave and the Bucks would replace him with Jeff Green. If that offer was there, fully guaranteed, no way does PJ leave it on the table."
Donte=Irving harden and Jeff green
"That man has stolen every penny he has made. The Jeff Green special goes like this: come out, take a few shots. If it's dropping? You might get a good Jeff Green game. If he misses and doesn't get going, he goes back to the hotel mentally by the second quarter."
"The Nets are never healthy lol so we only need to beat two of the big three. Also, free agency is gonna hurt them bad. No Jeff green, no Blake (maybe)."
Jeff Green is a center?
"I already mixed the two up for the past 5 years, but now Jeff and JaMychal Green are together at last. Brothers reunited."
Jeff Green to the Nuggets is SHOCKING. What did he sense was wrong with Brooklyn?
They drafted a combo guard (“Bones”) at 26.  Re-signed Barton to play full time SG.  Converted Howard to a RFA full time contract   Still have full MLE if a SG wanted to join us (by converting the Jeff Green contract to a sign and trade into our TLE pool).  Might have 1 more move to make.  In TC I trust.
Ppl thinking JaMychal Green is Jeff Green. Lol
Why did they not offer someone like Jeff Green $20 mil for one year? Who else can they get?
Someone explain to me the difference between Jamychal Green and Jeff Green and why the Nuggets got both.
"Well that is classic Jeff green. Shows up just enough for you to wish he played up to his potential,"
none of the names on the list above have been linked to the lakers outside of jeff green. at this point we only have taxpayer MLE and vet mins left and those signings tend to happen later in FA.
"How is Jaymichael getting more than Jeff Green, I still done understand how Jeff keeps getting underpaid. This is a great deal"
"why does Jeff Green get no respect?  for the money being given out, Jeff Green can't even get 10 mil a year?  alec burks got 3 yrs 30 mil"
What the fuck that's nothing. Lot of dudes taking hometown discounts rn wow. That's insulting tho tbh. Torrey Craig and Jeff Green got more. Portia even at 2/14 would be a steal still.
"Hell yeah, I love Jeff Green"
Jeff Green left the Nets. Love to see it.
"6'8, 35yo veteran Center Jeff Green. What's the problem?"
"Yeah, I really like a 4/5 with Jokic, solid backup C and can play some minutes at the 4 when they go big. And Jeff Green can play 3 through 5 so that's a pretty good pickup as well seeing as Gordon couldn't buy a shot sometimes."
Jaymychal/MPJ/AG/Jeff green/ jokic  Starting lineup?
"Damn good pickup for the Nuggets, no indication he was going there from what I saw.  Gordon, JaMychal Green and Jeff Green are three great versatile wing pickups in the past year for them. They need all the defense they can get to help MPJ and Jokic."
Jeff and JaMychal Green
Jeff Green is still on track to play for like half the teams in the league. It seems like he changes teams every season
Death. Taxes. Jeff Green staying Relevant
obviously nets dont care about much since they have their big 3...but Jeff Green was solid depth for them. Slight L
Is this going to be one of those seasons where Jeff Green is just somewhat underwheling on the team that signs he and then somehow finds a way onto a top playoff contender and plays 15 mins a game in the playoffs?
Jeff Green is a beast. Never forget he was the only dude who showed up with Bron vs the Celts ECF 2018
Congrats to Jeff Green for not getting a vet min deal
how can jeff green only that get much?
"Ahhh yeah, legend Jeff Green"
Jeff Green finally getting his bag
"Is Dinwiddie good enough to have a sweepstakes? If so, where does it stop, Cam Payne? Jeff Green? Nico Mannion? Anthony Bennett?"
"It matters a little bit.  Some of those periphery players around the Warriors and Lakers probably got paid a little more than they should have because they looked so much better next to some superstars.  Just look at Blake, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown.  Maybe they are better than what we thought they are, or maybe they look good because they're playing next to Durant, Harden and Kyrie.    The Mavs should be able to get players on short-term contracts who hope to maximize their statistical profiles to get paid again, but I'm not sure you want those type of players."
"Blake is still getting paid $30M from Detroit next season, so any salary he makes will be taken out of that. Unless he is looking for a multi-year deal, if he comes back, there's no reason for him to take anything but the minimum from Brooklyn.  I think OPJ for the MLE and Griffin for the vet's minimum look like good probabilities. I don't know about the Forbes rumors, they seem to have come out of nowhere. It definitely *seems* like Jeff Green is gone, but it wouldn't totally shock me if he decided to stay in BK for the minimum. I don't think it's especially likely, but I think it is a possibility."
Jeff Green maybe
Thanks! The market isn't really fair and your example with Jeff Green is a good one for that since he's one of the best contributing guys for the money. You're always going to get teams overpaying certain players just based off of what someone similar is getting.
"A guy making league min can be signed by anyone, and someone like Jeff Green who could be a bench piece on a contender is highly sought after.  Schroder is the better player but with how much money he wants there are just so few teams that are even realistic for him.  If Dennis only wanted like 5 million a year he would be way more sought after than Green"
Jeff Green has more competition because of the price he can be signed for. Dennis Schroeder would have more competition if teams knew they could get him at a Jeff Green salary.
"But Jeff Green will have more competition, so why wouldn’t the teams that make offers to Schroeder be able to keep the cost down?"
"There are a lot of factors but much of it is precedent and market demand.   Jeff Green is coming off a vet min deal and anything more would be considered a promotion and paying more to get him. He's also seen as a supportive role player.   Dennis is coming off a $16m deal and anything less is maybe paying him the value he's showed; and anything more is paying him more than he's worth. He's seen as a 6th-man, with potentially more to show. Plus, he's a PG and the market for PGs is drying up."
&gt;The $$$ people will get confuses me. Lots of teams want Jeff Green. Maybe more than the teams who want Dennis Schroeder? Why would Dennis make so much more than Jeff though  He has a skillset which is more valuable and has a bigger responsibility. That's why he commands more money even though I don't think he's a really good PG (good player but a bad floor general).
The $$$ people will get confuses me.  Lots of teams want Jeff Green.  Maybe more than the teams who want Dennis Schroeder?  Why would Dennis make so much more than Jeff though
so Jeff Green basically gone?
Jeff Green
"I was going to say, like what business does he have reporting on Jeff Green? Especially since he’s not linked to Milwaukee"
"So they're now interested and rumored to be wanting to sign IT, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, and Jeff Green.  Brad is truly saying fuck it and resetting the clock to 2017."
Does Jeff Green only appear during the playoffs
Jeff Green is a nice role player who is capable of swinging a game.
I’d be down for a Jeff Green comeback
How many teams is this for Jeff Green now in like the past 7 yrs alone if goes to Mia  By my count would be 10. Jesus
"There’s also the stigma with min offers I hear. Basically if you ring chase on a min, you tend to get more min offers and less offers on what your actually worth. See Jeff Green and the number often contracts he’s been given. I’m sure he’s asked for more but he can’t shake the min label now"
Jeff Green is gonna have a lot of options. He's a useful player.
Why would Jeff Green go back to BOS. All they did was talk that ish about him
"Ya the issue is not the team or the location, it's the pay. Good luck convincing DeRozan, Batum, etc. to come on a vet min. You get one MLE, and that's it - after that, you're stuck with the dregs of whatever's left from Ariza/Jeff Green/Patty Mills.   Good luck beating the Nets with that."
"Batum, jeff green, and rudy gay are all guys i'd really want to play the 4."
Jeff Green?
"Actually their second round draft pick Raiquan Gray from FSU is a playmaking stretch 4 who can emulate a lot of what Jeff Green gave the Nets.  Obviously he won't be nearly as good yet because Green is a 14 year vet, but Gray spend 4 years in college and has an excellent basketball IQ so I really think he could contribute."
"You can blame Zach Lowe for that. He lambasted the magic for giving him that big one year deal. This was following Jeff Green still earning nice contracts. His words were something along the lines of, ""how about 1 or 2 million""? It's been minimums ever since."
"Jeff Green, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley?  Are Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller available too??"
"So we traded for Al Horford, want to sign Jeff Green, Avery Bradley, and Kelly Olynyk?   Anyone know what Antoine Walker and Eddie House are up to?"
"Batum or Bullock on the mini-MLE is my #1 realistic wish.  I'd prefer we pass on guys like Oladipo, Mcgee and Iggy and instead look at Rudy Gay, Dwight, Jeff Green and perhaps even Melo. OPJ is also a name that would be decent as long as he can stay healthy."
I don't think that's physically possible for Jeff Green.
"I mean we're kinda limited. I hope the Nets re-sign Bruce Brown, keep one of Jeff Green or Blake, go after Forbes or JJ Redick (only for the minimum), and I guess sign and trade Dinwiddie to Washington since it seems like he wants to go there (for Kuz and Thomas Bryant not Trez).   Other than that we can really only go after ring chasers that will take the minimum. Hopefully we can add some decent defenders."
Bradley Jeff green and mills I think would be decent fits because those guys can be solid bench contributors   Not sure how many of those guys Boston tries to sign
"As much as I'd like him on the Lakers, Jeff Green should definitely look for a long-term at this point"
Lol I remember there was a joke years ago about Jaylen Brown being flat top Jeff Green and Jayson Tatum being light skin Rudy Gay
Those dudes took one game from us that required Jeff green and Durant going off plus us choking.   Anyways the fact that you put the Bucks and the suns there and not the 02 nets show how much you think about us. 80% of your comments are about us or Giannis.
Jeff Green would be an all-time kind of guy.
You telling me Durant jeff green joe Harris and Blake are better than the 02 nets ? Got it.
Durant joe Harris Blake Bruce brown and Jeff green is definitely amazing. That’s the team the bucks beat. The best team they beat was the suns who only got there cuz of injrueisb
"Ah yes, Jeff Green is well known for his habits of eating lard out of Home Depot bucket"
"Did you watch Milwaukee-BKN?  Milwaukee was barely and I mean barely able to run any offense against Brooklyn's backups, they had Blake Griffin on Giannis ffs, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, 1 legged Harden, KD who has never been anywhere near an elite defender, dude Nick Claxton who has played 47 NBA games was their #1 defender.    Bledsoe wasn't the problem &amp; they likely still win the Finals w him, this was a down year for the NBA with injuries."
"How? They have a DPOY candidate &amp; proven top tier playoff defender in Draymond, and guys who play hard? Wiggins is really freakin good too and a much better 2nd option than the Cavs without LeBron (JR Smith or Jeff Green? lol).  The Cavs is a bunch of inconsistent vets who can't string any good set of games together without LeBron *on both sides*. Just a bunch of old inconsistent, unmotivated vet role players thrown together with no synergy, and who are terrible on both sides.  Curry may carry that 21 Warriors offense like Bron did, but Curry was carried by the defense as usual as they finished top ten.  Warriors in 6."
"Frl though  We're probably the only ones who were happy when he left OKC for the Warriors aside from Warriors fans(and some of the comments I've seen from them even make me doubt that)  Besides the only remaining Sonics are him and Jeff Green(who actually was his teammate this past season), he's like our last significant link to the current NBA at this point"
"I mean you can compare him to other centers if you want, but I think I was pretty clear that I wasn't doing that or interested in it.  I mean it's not like I would do that with any other aspect either. Like if you have center who's good shooter for a center, but average shooter overall I would say he's average shooter.  I did also address the position in my first comment as I recall right as I noted that you can't really build great team defense around him due to his position.  If you don't like said defensive impact metrics I do wonder what type of defensive statistics you feel are valuable then, since box score stats that we have for defense are imo much worse.  Also you seem to be making the claim or at least implying that I don't use them as supplementary material which is somewhat odd considering that my original comment included no statistics at all and what some might refer as eye test.  I mean if you rather have me just say that I disagree that's fine. Just seemed not that productive and boring.  Personally I think I could come up with maybe 10 or so center's with decent minutes that I would consider to be neutral or negative defender's and I don't think I would put Jokic into that category. That would be guys like Kanter, Porzingis or Jeff Green for example."
Jeff Green triple bypass surgery
"&gt;The worst team lebron played in the finals is better than the best team Jordan played   2011 Mavs is not better than the 90's Jazz lol, or the '93 Suns or '96 Sonics for that matter. Plus, its not like Lebron had a better team than the Bad Boy Pistons in his own conference.  &gt;Imagine being guarded by Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec in finals after finals instead of defensive players of the year like Leonard and green  Two can play this game. Imagine being guarded by JJ Barea, Demar Derozan and rookie Jayson Tatum instead of prime Rodman, Gary Payton, Joe Dumars and John Starks.   &gt;yet lebron has much better finals performances  Really? Lebron averages 28/10/8 on 48% FG and 4 turnovers per game in the finals. Jordan averages 34/6/6 on 48% FG and 3 turnovers per game in the finals."
The worst team lebron played in the finals is better than the best team Jordan played   Imagine being guarded by Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec in finals after finals instead of defensive players of the year like Leonard and green yet lebron  has much better finals performances
What do any of these players have in common? Lol  Like there's absolutely nothing in tatums game that reminds me of LeBron. And Jeff Green is just random
"dude... that's what defensive rating is all about. It's about playing at the right time with the right lineup. It has nothing to do with your individual defense in small samples, it's about when you play and with whom. Mike James played with lineups that stopped the Bucks, thus his drtg is better. Jeff Green (who played only 15 more minutes in the whole series), was not as lucky."
"Because defensive rating is a trash stat for comparing defense. Do you agree that Mike James is a better defender than KD, Giannis, Lopez, Holiday, Blake, and Jeff Green?  And the matchup data as well as opponents percentages favor Giannis actually, so idk what you're going on about"
"Yeah that's a crazy argument lol. Mike James is a better defender than Jeff Green in defensive rating. Usually even this sub, who loves stats, would use more than just misleading DRTNG.  Real tangible defensive impact is when your help defense and rim protection is so potent the opposing team takes 6 less shots in the paint per game compared to the previous round solely because of you. KD's impact on Giannis individually was not elite (and vice versa with Giannis not guarding him), but outside of that Giannis' impact is a few levels above KD's."
"/thread  The ultimate eye test versus box score. I also love how much more impactful he is in the playoffs, one of the rare non-top 10 players whose game is elevated in a playoff setting.  Some other candidates:  * Bruce Brown and Jeff Green for the Nets last year  * DFS  * Richaun Holmes  * Nerlens Noel"
"I mean he almost beat your team (that won the title) with his best players being Harden on one leg, bought out Blake and Jeff Green? lol"
Grant Williams  Jeff Green  Jerami Grant
"Harden likely wouldn’t have played if Kyrie was still healthy, for a start.  Of course I’m making assumptions, the whole topic is nothing but assumptions. Assuming the Bucks play such garbage offence that back to back 85 point games are par for the course instead of wildly improving like they did from games 4-7. Assuming Jeff Green and Blake Griffin still combine for 44 points on 15/22 shooting while KD has arguably the best game of his career in game 5. Assuming KD still puts up the same kind of numbers when he’s got Kyrie to take more shots. Assuming Jrue still can’t score the whole time. Assuming Middleton continues playing like hot ass every time he goes to Brooklyn. And so on.  If the question is “Hey if the Nets had Kyrie and he just scored all the bad shots other guys missed instead of the good ones they hit and also the Bucks don’t play differently in any way at all do the Nets win?” then the answer is probably yes, but that’s also just not how basketball works. If we’re going to talk hypotheticals let’s talk, just going “Ah well actually all those hypotheticals in your favour are a bridge too far while the ones in their favour are definitely legit” dilutes the conversation to the point of meaninglessness."
Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals than Jordan while being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff Hornasec. You tried
Jeff green.  Funnily enough now he’s a hot commodity for the backup role he fills
Dratini: Jeff Green  Dragonair: Jason Tatum  Dragonite: LeBron James
"The Bucks play drop center defense. It also has gotten blamed when they lose in the playoffs. There’s nuance to it though, like if the Bucks are facing a team playing Kevin Durant and Jeff Green for 40+ of their center minutes, you really need to have 5s with lateral speed for switches, or double down on the difference between playstyles and utilize your roll man’s size advantage heavily on offense.  Rudy Gobert is elite at finishing roll man plays in the NBA. Actually the Olympic finals this year was literally a team playing small ball centers including Durant vs Gobert and if Gobert hit 90% of free throws (he was earning a hell of a lot of them) his team would’ve won the game. The balancing act is the frequency and efficiency of each team’s opposite, optimal play— ball screens for jump shots by the small team, screen and rolls for roll man finishes by the big team.   It’s still just tempting to say that if an opposing team is killing your drop center defense to the tune of 130 offensive rating, the defensive style is nearing being unplayable. I’m tempted to say the Jazz might be getting a bit unlucky. But there’s much more to the equation than just 2 play types. People just rationalize around the results (most later series are close, and at that point everything from FT% to extra possessions is arguably changing the series). “The team that lost was worse” is the truest thing you can say, but also the only thing you can say with less refinement than comparing broad, conceptual styles."
"&gt; They've added Patty mills, while the Bucks have lost PJ Tucker, an important defensive piece during that series.  Nets also lost Jeff Green, whereas the Bucks will be adding Dante back. Not saying the Bucks would win or anything, but just trying to add more context to this upcoming season."
Tbf the Nets also lost Jeff Green. They wouldn't have made it to game 7 without him.
"so why arent we including spencer dinwiddie and jeff green missing half the series? Also if you think harden in games 5-7 was even 50%$ of his normal capabilities you didnt even wsatch anything.   Donte is an important player for the bucks but hes their 5th best player. Thats why he isnt getting mentioned. its not comparable to stars geting hurt.   And yeah the bucks got lucky, but so did the suns. so why cant we give the suns credit for making the finals?"
Jeff green and Javale could both be added for big man depth.
"I would like a team of Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jalen Green, Draymond Green and Javonte Green please."
"The Nets, even with the injuries, were not dogshit. Maybe not a finals caliber team, but to suggest they were BAD is revisionist history. Kyrie played three games and was injured in game 4. Jeff Green was ready for the second half of the series. KD, Blake, Harris would start for every team in the league.  KD is in the conversation for his heroics in that series. Giannis is in our for his legendary postseason and Finals fun including numerous iconic plays and games."
"Non super teams also have better role players, which was my point. Nets still had KD who is arguably the best in the league. They wouldn’t have won game 5 if it was for Jeff Green over performing from 3."
"Jimmy Butler, KD, and Jeff Green all use it :P   I can't say for sure he's going for this, but Wiggins initiated a lot of his drives with a move that looked like this when he was with us"
Except they aren’t lol the whole team played like ass throughout that series aside from Kd and Kyrie with the exception of a good game from Blake and Jeff Green.
"If you choose to close out on someone you’re not supposed to then yes it’s gonna break down. Doubling can lead to scrambling but you don’t need to close out on every single guy open on the perimeter. You recognize the 3pt threats and stay on them.   Also In case you weren’t watching, Joe Harris found himself open plenty of times without any doubling and bricked the majority of them  But yeah don’t double the guy giving you 40 a night because you don’t want Blake griffin or Jeff green taking open 3’s lmao. They LITERALLY almost lost the series because they didn’t double. If they doubled kd wouldn’t have been able to turn and fade like that"
"Dude the only reason I started counting when the series was 2-2 was because you said Bud should have swept the remaining games once KD was the sole healthy superstar. So if we are going to apply **your** logic to the 2015 finals, we need to look at the games where Lebron was the sole healthy superstar (I.e games 1 - 5). So using **your** logic, Kerr and the Warriors should’ve swept the Cavs but instead they went 3-2 and since he couldn’t he must be a poor coach too right?  And I ignored your “coincidences” because they were a lazy argument. You can do what-if’s for any series. What if KD’s feet were an inch smaller? What if Jeff Green doesn’t have the best game of his career? What if Bruce Brown throw Game 3? What if Middleton and Jrue don’t shoot 30% from the field Game 1?"
"They're not any more 'top heavy' than you guys are.   They actually have an equal/better supporting cast based on how well they were playing until 2 of their 3 stars went down (and even after). Blake, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris &amp; company &gt;&gt; old Lopez, Portis.  The Nets bench was up 50 pts on yall in Game 2 as Blake was outplayin Giannis, lmaoo. They just lost on a game winner as they were put in a historically impossible positions.  If the Bucks top-heavy roster had their stars get injured, they would get swept, so your point is moot."
"""What if"" PJ Tucker hadn't fouled out because Blake Griffin was grappling him off ball? ""What if"" a foul had been called when Jeff Green has holding down Lopez' arms with the ball? Bucks won so it's been forgotten, but the officiating was horribly one-sided. If KD's foot had been an inch back there'd be integrity of the game conversations."
"Every-other game Jeff Green  Edit: I love Jeff, I regret saying this"
Also they had a Jeff Green
"Seemed like he was making some good (if uneven) progress until Clarkson came along. There was that one game he and Jeff Green led a third quarter comeback that got me really excited.   Obviously much more happy with our lord and savior JC, but I wish Mudiay the best"
Jeff Green
New Jeff Green
"Kevin Love isn’t a 16 game player &amp; is a empty calories player. He can’t defend on the perimeter and he can’t defend in the interior so teams in the playoffs will always hunt him. He was never a winning player &amp; in his first six years the most games he won in a season was 40…Bosh at least got the Raptors into the playoffs multiple seasons. The reason the Heat worked with Bosh as the third option is because Bosh was great defensively &amp; could switch unlike Love. Bosh could score 0 points in a game but still have a impact because of his defense, if Love couldn’t score he was basically not on the court. I believe the Cavs would’ve had a better successful run if the Cavs traded their assets for Horford instead of Love prior to the 14-15 season or traded away Love for Paul George after the 15-16 season &amp; signed Jeff Green to play the 4."
harden is at least 20lbs lighter in this video i legit thought that was jeff green at first.
"lebron had a chip on his shoulder the whole playoffs. he farmed us especially without question, but no other team in that 2018 run was as frightened as us raps fans over his role players. jeff green in the corner would have us all screaming FUCKKKK at the tv. JEFF GREEN!!!  i feel like you had to be a raps fan to understand the pain we went through that series"
"Tony **Parker**, Tim **Duncan**, Lonzo and his brothers **Ball**, Jeff **Green**, **Ray** Allen, **Dr J** and **Doc Rivers** (I know the real names but it should count) **Moses** Malone,"
"You're forgetting Durant averaged 35/10/5/1/1 with his 2nd best player being either Jeff green, pirate harden or a Joe Harris that just forgot how to shoot against the eventual champs. Kawhi is excellent and a top 10 current player but Durant is probably top 25 all time which Kawhi can't touch"
"Curry is great because of the gravity he creates that allows for others to be playmakers on the team.   &gt;It's not like this is the first season he's actually had a decent to good PG.   Tbf here his best playmaking PG was Rubio who still can't shoot so its harder for him to create then a playmaking guard who can.   And, best overall guard was probably Jeff Teague, or Derrick Rose? So too say he's had a anything above slightly below average players consistently in his career at PG would be IMO a slight stretch.   &gt;I'm not saying he can't be a good player. But people still seem to be expecting a jump from him when he hasn't made a jump after year 3.  Here I won't lie as a Canadian who just wants him to succeed I might over compensate with him a bit. That being said Ik at this point he's a rich mans Jeff Green it is just exciting when you see someone with promise at least add something to his game we have not consistently seen, and hope it continues."
Game 7 Jeff Green tho
"2016-18 Cavs had to be amongst the craziest roster shakeups in pro sports history. Yet they still made it to the finals. After Kyrie forced his way out, they signed a ton of redemption projects hoping they could eek out an ounce of their former glory days. D Wade, D Rose, Isiah Thomas(part of the trade tho), Deron Williams, Bogut, Birdman, Larry Sanders, Jeff Green."
Kd made the playoffs in his 3rd season averaging 30 ppg with Jeff Green as his 2nd best player. Calm down.
"RoCo, Steven Adams, Russ, Furkan Korkmaz, Clint Capela.... technically Gerald Green (FOR NOW HOPEFULLY)... Embiid, Wenyen Gabriel, Jeff Green,  K-Love, Ja, Sabonis, KAT... I think that's most of them. No specific reason just dudes I like"
"What about the legend himself, Game 7 Jeff Green"
Lest we forget the Jeff Green signing!
If we had this years batum instead of matt Barnes/Paul Pierce/Caron butler/hedo turkeyglue/LRMBAM/Jeff green at our 3 I think we would have won a championship during the lob city years
“Hahaha they just massively overpaid flat top Jeff Green” - r/nba offseason 2019
"DJ isn’t good enough to see the floor in order to rebound. We just closed with Jeff Green at C.  Allen is historically a good rebounder, but Washington mobbed him on the boards and no one else stepped up  Allen also turned the ball over for every rebound he did get"
"Nash trusts Jeff Green to close out at C over DJ lmao  Please let us trade him, Kevin"
"Fuck yes, god damn we got lucky. What an entertaining game, if the Nets let Allen finish the game at center instead of Jeff Green it might have been a different ending."
"They went with Jeff Green at the 5 for switchability, always going to give up orebs   It's take your poison type of deal"

"He's Jeff Green 2.0. All the potential in the world, just never consistent enough to bring his game to the next level"
How many games you think Hill/JR/Jeff Green/TT wins lol?
"They were not. In game 7, Rozier shot 2-14 and Brown shot 5-18. Jaylen Brown was outplayed by Jeff Green in that game. Kyrie and Hayward would not have performed that badly."
"Bro, you're forgetting love and Kyrie werent there  His starting 5 in game 7 of the ECF was JR, Jeff Green, George Hill, and Tristan Thompson."
"Dude was down 3-2 without love or Kyrie and still won the ECF. Seriously dude, his starting lineup in **game 7 of the ECF** was JR, George Hill, Jeff Green, and TT  If LeBron can make the finals with that, curry should be able to make the damn playoffs lol  Oubre was averaging 17 a game last season,  wiggins was at 22, he's still got Draymond, etc. People are making the players seem worse to fit the results    Is it a good roster? No. Is it bottom of the barrel only better than the Knicks like OP said? Hellll no."
"Love, Jeff Green, Korver, George Hill, JR. All guys that were serviceable and better than this Warriors supporting cast tbh. (Not just looking at one game, but the whole run.)"
"Last years team was certainly trash, here's the team.  A generational talent at the top of his game.  Jeff Green, doesn't matter that literally no one wanted him.  BMac, doesn't matter that literally no one wanted him.  Rivers, doesn't matter that literally no one wanted him.  PJ, a valuable but old glue guy.  Covington, 3&amp;D guy that should be a championship teams 5th best player but might be the 2nd on this team.  An EG coming off two straight injury plagued seasons.   And an incredibly inefficient shell of himself and injured former MVP."
Yeah the nets aren't; we all overhuped them. Lol KD has no support he has to rely on Joe Harris (who?) And Jarret Allen (whose like 23) and Jeff green who is very unreliable
Andrew Wiggins is this generation's Jeff Green except on a max contract
Jeff Green takes freethrows exactly like LeBron
Jeff Green got that in his bag? Sheesh!
Kyrie Irving: Bad defender  Joe Harris : terrible defender   KD: used to be okay. Slow as fuck these days  DeAndre: terrible against guards  Allen: overrated as hell   From top to bottom you guys are filled with horrible defenders. I can't name a single plus defender. Maybe Jeff Green? And he's like 40
"I appreciate Otto because he's the only good Georgetown player left in the league. Well, him and Jeff Green i guess"
the new jeff green
obviously Jeff Green
"2011 Celtics with Shaq, KG, PP, Allen, Rondo + a second unit of Jermaine O'Neal, Troy Murphy, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley, and Nate Robinson. That is an absolutely stupid starting five with a crazy second unit."
I’m not sure who KD guards. Harden is a good defender as well though. I think Taurean Prince or Jeff Green would get assigned to AD or Lebron.
Jeff Green so solid
"Jeff green imo was a really underrated pickup by the nets, he could be an x-factor in the playoffs. he was great with the rockets last year especially in the pnr with harden. And now that harden is on the nets with d'antoni the gang is back together lol"
Dude and I just realized they have Jeff Green on their team already too! They can bring it back to that 2011 starting lineup 10 years later!
Harden played great with jeff green and joe harris
I don't even understand the defensive concept for the playoffs.  They're either going to have to rely on Jeff Green/DJ playing out of their minds or ask KD to play 40+ min two-way.  I don't see it.  They really needed to keep Allen.
Jimmy Butler to Minnesota   Shaq to the Suns   Jeff Green for Kendrick Perkins
You have to realize who is Nash's assistant. He traded everyone last year so he could play PJ Tucker and Jeff Green at center position. Guess who is on the Nets  Only difference is that Harden now is playing with Durant instead of Danuel fucking House jr.
"I agree I think too people are definitely overestimating the kind of talent that usually comes up on the buyout market  last year the best guys available were MKG, Markieff Morris, Marvin Williams, Carroll, Jeff Green, Waiters and Burke. Even if they had their complete pick there none of those guys are fixing the defence, no reason I can think of to assume it'll be dramatically better this season"
They CAN but I wouldn’t count on it. Their supporting cast is really bad after Joe Harris. You can count on Jeff Green to have 2 big playoff games and do nothing else the rest of the time
"I think people are way overestimating the kind of talent that is usually available on the buyout market  Last year the biggest names off my head signed were MKG, Markieff Morris, Marvin Williams, Carroll, Jeff Green, Waiters and Burke  could get an alright role player or two but it's not a given they are fixing their defence with it"
Y’all forgot Jeff Green was the original big 3 in OKC.
Good to see Jeff Green still playing
his passes to jeff green who he played with last season were ON POINT
Jeff Green was fantastic in the PnR with Harden last year.  He could effectively  roll to the rim *or* pop out for the three and he's good enough to dribble the ball and make decisions when needed as well.  I thought they were great together last year and I'm happy they are back together in brooklyn.
Jeff Green had his life saved because they caught an issue with his heart at a physical.
"It would never happen but I just want them to trade kyrie for russ and see the old okc thunder. Kd, Russ, Harden, and Jeff green , brings back some good memories during those time"
"I don’t remember the specifics, but Jeff Green was getting a team physical and they discovered an irregularity with his heart. So they must go pretty in depth with it"
Jeff Green is going to be beaten to a pulp playing the small ball 5 so much out of necessity for 60 games plus the playoffs.
They have Jeff green
Jeff green is going play the 5 for significant minutes 2 years in a row
&gt;lol can't wait for teams to double team Harden from the half court only for ~~KD~~ ~~Kyrie~~ ~~Joe Harris~~ Jeff Green to absolutely murk them
"Do they even have the money for that? I feel mcgee could be a better option tbh if we're looking at cavs centers  Big, athletic rim running bigs are a dime a dozen anyways. Khem birch on orlando maybe? Really you just need someone out there for like 15-20 mins a game out there. You got Jeff green and kd to put at the 5 to maximize the offense too"
"Miami made it work because they made clear cut roles for players like: Mike miller, Udonis Haslem, Mario Chalmers, James Jones.   Nets will have to do something about Joe Harris, Jeff Green and whoever, to solidify this teams identity while the big three play at their level (carry) night in night out"
Along with Jeff Green
Jeff Green and DJ frontcourt is...suspicious.
Jeff Green was a good pick up this off-season.
That Jeff Green finish is underrated.
Same thing happened to Jeff Green if I recall.
Just realized jeff green is on this bkn team as well. Damn gotta get thabo back as well lmao
I forgot that Harden is probably close with Jeff Green too since they played together in Oklahoma City
"Yea, I remember when Jeff Green had to get heart surgery. They caught it and listed him as out for the rest of the season during training camp."
I still got love for Jeff Green. Glad to see him on a good team
Jeff Green in 2020: Playing center with James Harden for Mike D'Antoni   Jeff Green in 2021:

Jeff Green is a starter on a superteam in 2021. Shit's wild.
"Yeah and the Nets are deeper than most people realize and are clearly not done making moves. TLC, Bruce Brown, Chiozza and Jeff Green are not as trash tier as people like you make them out to be"
"It's a problem for now, but I have full faith in Marks to make good use of those 3 open roster spots  Our defense isn't all terrible atm though. KD has been stellar on defense so far, and Bruce Brown has been good as well. We also have quite a few defenders that aren't good, but also aren't negatives either. Guys like Joe Harris, Jeff Green, TLC, and even Kyrie at times this season. Hoping Harden falls into that category as well.  I think as long as well can get a decent center from the buyout/trade market then our defense won't be as much of a problem. Our biggest issue is just that we have to give DJ heavy minutes now, and he's just not good enough for that"
"I can't fucking believe you seriously think that Kyrie is gonna retire.   They have 3 superstars. 1 great shooter (Harris), 1 average center (Jordan), 2 rotation pieces (Brown and TLC) and Shamet. Jeff Green is Jeff Green but he'd play some regular season minutes as well. And even if he's out at least for a year, Dinwiddie will come back to this roster. This is deep enough when you have 3 legitimate superstars."
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
2013/2014 Celtics.  Jeff Green [hit a buzzer beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jCq6HjIJGw&amp;ab_channel=huff99) against the heat and it is still one of my favorite memories. Jordan Crawford/Avery Bradley/ Gerald Wallace/ Jeff Green/ KellyOlynyk was a hell of a lineup
"Hey Op, I did this for Reddit though the playoffs and finals the other year (under my old account). It was pretty popular so no, you’re not alone.    Someone mentioned these already, but NBAkicks, Slamkicks, NiceKicks, BRKicks are good places to start. Not all of these pages always identify the model of the shoe, so there may be some that you struggle with.    Even more so than last season, the league is built on player exclusives (‘PE’) now. There are so so many PE’s now that you’re unlikely to get your hands on some of the better colorways you may spot this year. Nearly any model you see which is a Kobe IV, V, or VI will be a PE. Same with the Jordan 35’s - Luka, Zion, Tatum have some dope PE’s that you won’t be able to get. Even Jeff Green and Richi still have PE’s"
And you know those 3 gonna get Nash to bench Drummond’s ass for Jeff Green if he plays as inefficiently as he does.
We can waive Javonte Green and trade Jeff Teague to clear the space
Jeff Green is better at this point.
Jeff green showing up big in a game 7 still makes zero sense
"I think people misunderstand what is the logic behind a superteam. If you have 3 stars (or more), you can continue without missing a beat.   Take for example the Warriors in 2019, even without KD, they still managed to beat both Houston and sweep the Trailblazers. They had a little issue with Raptors but ultimately lost another star in Klay too.   Similarly, in the Nets situation right now, Kyrie and KD have both missed time this season for various reasons. Having Harden in there means that there is always an elite playmaker (would be better if Dinwiddie was around though) to create for the rest of the team. In comparison, having Jrue, Harris, Allen, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown/PJ Tucker would make a terrible offensive team."
But you need a bigger body than Jeff green at center.
Davis fell off a cliff but Jeff Green saved his career by re-inventing himself as a small-ball 5.
I thought Jeff Green &amp; Ed Davis were fantastic signings who would be key roleplayers last season.
"Idk man the eagles are a real Jeff green kinda player where you’ll never know when they’re gonna show up and decide to be MVP.   Look I respect the Urukai’s perimeter defense, but Sauron is a black hole on offense and literally allows players to walk to the hole on defense. You cannot depend on late game collapses from Sméagol in a playoff game."
"Jeff Green would honestly be perfect for the C’s. Minimum vet guy, big body, can hit the 3 at a solid clip, adequate defense.  He also led a players only meeting after an embarrassing loss to the Pistons and we’ve smashed our next couple games."
When was Jeff Green going to be “The Man” in Boston😂
Kyrie -kd - Jeff green - harden - Joe Harris is currently blowing teams out in the 4th quarter
"To inform people that Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Deandre Jordan combine for 110.7 pts/game on 66% TS"
That Jeff green catch and lay up is even more insane
"Chill this was against the warriors, 6th seed is our goal this year haha. Our best two way player is out. Beating us isn't a great litmus test for title contenders, at least not this year.   DJ is still a massive hole they should be fixing. I'm not convinced on their defense yet. I can see a couple of teams exploit their defensive weakness. I can also see deeper teams exploit their lack of depth. At the top level this team is 3 stars, 1 pretty good player (harris) 1 decent player (Jeff green but he might be better than I give him credit for), and a few question marks (Shamet and Brown but ). That isn't bad, but Kyrie and Harden aren't very inspiring on defense."
"if you are relying on jeff green, your team is not good"
"So, this year, Jeff Green is averaging 9 points and 3.7 rebounds on almost 50% from the floor. Last year on Houston, he averaged 12 points, 3 rebounds on better shooting.   I definitely agree though that his game has improved into a solid role player since Boston. Houston and the Nets have placed him in positions where he is not expected to do as much, and where he can rely on more of his size than skill."
"I wish comeback player of the year was an award... although Steph or KD would be miles ahead of Jeff Green in the race too  Love Jeff Green, especially after his heart surgery."
"He put that in the perfect spot. Credit to Jeff Green for the one handed catch and finish, so sweet"
"irving scored around his true shooting tonight, 64%. Harden was well above with his 3pt shooting, but durant was pretty bad for his normal standards. What killed you guys was the inability to stop penetration and dump offs to bruce brown and the harden jeff green pnr."
Story of the game should be how the Nets uncontested gave up the Jeff Green on Curry switch the entire game and the Warriors went at him like 3 times.
That Jeff Green catch and finish made a bad pass look like art
From what I’ve seen tonight harden and Jeff green could make a finals run with three other shooters
"Jeff Green too, dude looks like Zion with the Warriors lack of size lmao."
I miss Jeff Green
I feel like Jeff Green is on like 5 different teams at the same time every year.
Yup. Even Jeff Green at the 5 is a mismatch right now
both the offense and defense are better without deAndre. I like the jeff green at the 5 youve been running lately. DeAndre looks so washed man its sad.
Jeff green has been in the nba 14 years and hasn’t aged at all he does the same mediocre stuff and flashes the same athleticism to dupe you
celtics jeff green would've yammed that shit lol
Jeff Green has been dunking those all season
Oh shit Jeff Green
Thank you Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green.
"LMFAO,    Yeah, you have to be better... I couldn't agree more.  I fell asleep in the 3rd quarter because I'm getting old, but this is amazing.  I miss 2nd Stint LeBron Cavs so much :(, now the Nets are basically trying to be them with Kyrie / KD instead of Bron, Jeff Green... and isn't RJ their color commentator? AND they have our goddamn game announcer (dude who announces threeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee etc.).  Wish RJ could narrate more LeBron games."
"Cavs starting lineup in Game 6 and 7 of ECF in 2018 (Love was injured):   George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron, Jeff Green, Tristan Thompson.  Beal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literally everybody on the 2018 Cavs, including Love."
"And Jeff Green, he is doing bad"
Bruh I’m dumb as fuck I saw this as Jeff green for a second and I was so lost
"I mean KD's MVP was def an *offensive* carry job, just like Steph this year, carrying the Warriors *offensively* of the back of a Top 5 defense. KD's last real carry job was probably in 2010, where he carried his team to 50 wins with Jeff green as his next best player"
Jeff Green dunking all over us.
Jeff green is en excellent role player. He can take over games and get 20 points sometimes
"When you got 3 bigs on the floor with the Lakers (one being the ultimate playmaker, mind you), who’s gonna guard Lebron? Ok Kd. Who’s then got Ad? An older Jeff green or older Blake griffin? Umm sure. And then who’s got Drummond? Washed-up Deandre Jordan?! Lmao.   Do you see the problem? These other teams have defensive issues when it comes to guarding the Lakers. I’m not saying the Lakers can fully guard the nets, they got firepower out the ass, but the Lakers are one of the best teams equipped to defend them.   Jokic doesn’t have Murray and if they couldn’t knock off the lakers last year, they aren’t doing this year without a Jamal Murray. So bringing up the nuggets is just dumb.   But idk why you are now bringing up other teams. You started with the suns, and sorry to say the suns are not beating the Lakers 4 out of 7."
"Who are those excellent role players lol. Other than Harris who they got, Jeff Green? Blake?"
"Why would I have blinders on? I have no love for Draymond or GSW. You're being hyperbolic. People have been calling Draymond a playmaker for literally years (he's in their legendary Death Lineup for a reason). If you are focused on idiot fans who say otherwise, then I can't help that but here's actual sources that have been high on Draymond's passing/facilitating for years:  [From 2015](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/draymond-green-stephen-curry-passing-assist-warriors-record/dan4l6z8sf381ricwy3ta70kc), and then again from [2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruEfcAgebzU), from Jeff Van Gundy (2015):  &gt; ""Draymond Green has the decision making of an elite point guard.""  and then again from [2015](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/we-interrupt-this-eulogy-for-the-nba-post-up-game-to-bring-you-its-rebirth/), Zach Lowe wrote in 2015:  &gt; And with the scoring threat established, Green could do what he does best: read help defense and fling smart passes all over the floor. ... Green is a playmaking 4.  and then again in 2015:  &gt; He’s a freaking monster, the prototypical playmaking 4, with the unmatched versatility to jostle with Marc Gasol and stick stride-for-stride with James Harden.  and again in [2015](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2508657-br-nbas-max-5-series-is-draymond-green-really-a-maximum-contract-player).

Jeff Green? Really?
"Correct me if I’m wrong but his main weakness seems to be an inability to cash in on mid-round and late-round draft picks. They might just need to overhaul the way they scout lower round guys.  For Sean Marks it’s his affinity for giving large contracts to three-and-D guys who never pan out. Prince, Crabb, he tried to sign Tyler Johnson, etc.  Meanwhile the guy we sign to a minimum is the guy who actually performs (Jeff Green). Though admittedly Jeff is a sieve on defense most of the time."
"It has KD, Harden, and Jeff Green. Plus Oklahoma’s own Blake Griffin"
"I don’t disagree about us getting smoked but I do think those numbers don’t tell the full story.   The first game was the second game of the season with both teams looking nothing like they do now. Despite the final score, there were still 8 lead changes and we were within 7 at the beginning of the 4th quarter before falling apart.   The second game we played, we literally were within 4 with 2 minutes and 10 seconds left and there were 7 lead changes with our biggest lead being 11 and theirs being 12.   And then the last one we only lost by 5 and it was actually pretty tight until the very end. And Kd and Harden were out but so were Jaylen, Kemba, and Rob williams so their starters were Harris/Kyrie/Jeff Green/Shamet/Jordan but splitting minutes with Griffin while we had Tatum/Ojeleye/Thompson/Romeo/Smart.     None of this means anything because we never played against this specific nets team. I wouldn’t be surprise if the average margin was higher than 15. But I wouldn’t be surprise if it was less than that either."
"He also was able to easily shoot over or bully Beal and Westbrook. Harden is a bit bigger than them and in terms of bigs Jeff Green is light years beyond Bertans, Gafford, Len, and Lopez"
KD  Harden  Kyrie  Harris  Dinwiddie  Griffin  Claxton  Jeff Green
Now show 40 point games in the finals  Versus defensive players of the year like Leonard and green not pe teachers like Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec
"Give Seattle KD, Russ, Harden, Ibaka, and Jeff Green who all should've been SuperSonics this past decade. Hell they've almost recreated that in Brooklyn.  Seattle was fucked over so God damn bad. None of those players are in OKC anymore (plus like 4 other Hall of famers...LOL) so I'd say the league got a healthy dose of karma approving that move.  Biggest what if in NBA history, Sonics not going to Oklahoma."
Don't forget Jeff Green 😤
Sounding a bit like budget Jeff Green.  But hey Green made it work for a long career.
"I would put Jeff Green over Shamet. Statistically, Jeff is the better player (more points, rebounds and tied for assists). Not to mention he’s a great veteran and a good locker room guy that the Nets can get probably fairly cheaply.  Shamet has great potential and is an improving player, but I think that, right now, keeping Jeff around is important."
Jeff green for a solid role player and locker room presence. If the expansion team goes young they would prob need a guy like Uncle Jeff
same could be said about Jeff Green and Claxton ( arguably Shamet)   Harden is just a natural floor raiser and it took a few games but he's clicked very well with the whole nets roster and made them look good
Bill Simmons wanted to trade Tatum for Simmons in the 2019 offseason because he was worried about “Andrew Wiggins or Jeff Green potential”. Good thing his opinions don’t matter.
"Kobe scored 8 points in the finals twice. Also scored 2 points, what’s your point?   LeGOAT has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Jeff Hornasec and Danny Ainge   RIP"
I think it’s insane that Jeff Green has just exploded in terms of three point shooting. He’s a career 34% shooter from three and is shooting 41% this season. In his thirteenth season...
"Where are the people being held accountable for their Wiggins takes before the season? Talking about how he sucks, how he has no motivation to get better, how he has one or two good games a season like Jeff Green, how he has one of the worst contracts in the league, how the Warriors made a mistake bringing him in and they should have kept Dlo, and how Kerr's play calls were too complicated for him to be any good for the team?     Where did these people go? Like now it's all about how consistent he was this year and his emergence as a very solid two way player. What happened to the people talked about him like they do Drummond now? That's how people looked at him. We just gonna forget that was this places overwhelming opinion?"
"Lmao Jared Dudley has a ring so he must also be better than Harden correct?   Harden is on par with KD as a scorer and it isn't even close when it comes to playmaking. KD's average defense doesn't close the gap either.   I'd actually agree. Kyrie has had a crazy year that has honestly gone under the radar. Though I do believe AD is the better player when you add defense to the picture.   And no, the Nets bench frankly isn't close to the Lakers bench.  Harris, Claxton, Jeff Green, Shamet, Johnson, TLC &amp; Mike James vs Kuzma, Caruso, Gasol, Trez, Morris, Matthews, THT &amp; McLemore.   I don't see an argument for the Nets bench tbh."
"1 all nba level guy and scrubs doesnt make you a good team, especially when you dont have a great defense. We would be much worse if marks didnt pull bruce brown, claxton, shamet, and jeff green from the scrap heap.  But its fine, like i said i dont expect credit from anyone especially knicks fans who have even more big market advantages than us yet still struggle to attract free agents."
"enough is enough, drug test Jeff Green"
Jeff Green is shooting over 40% from 3 this year.
he's a big one but it's a plague. Jeff Green is also lazy as fuck unless he's trying to dunk on someone
Definitely not in the finals. Even though lebron has more 40 point games vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs plumbers  like Jeff hornasec and Danny ainge  Lebron passed Jordan in scoring on 2k less shots
Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs plumbers like Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec  BJ Armstrong was an all star in the 90s! Lmao   Weakest era in nba history   Imagine playing Shawn kemp in the finals. That team wouldn’t make the playoffs today
"I'm going to hop on the T-Wolves Bandwagon if we lose because Bruce Brown and Jeff Green go off on us.      I can accept KD toasting us, but if Ben and Joel shut the superstars down and we lose to....Jeff.....freaking......Green.....please no"
"Jeff Green, one of the most inconsistent players on a night to night basis, kills the Celtics every time he plays them."
Nets role plays stepped the fuck up  Claxton was looking great on defense  Jeff Green and Brown did their thing
"The big 3 really carried us today. Bruce, Claxton and Jeff Green are going to need some help from the role players like KD and Harden in the playoffs if we want to go anywhere though"
"Jeff ""Kevin Durant"" Green"
"Jeff green needs to play all his minutes with harden on the floor, those 2 are a great duo"
Nets have KD and Harden if that interests you at all. Plus Jeff Green used to play on the Thunder iirc.
Poor Jeff Green.
"I agree, the video itself is really nice. The Jeff Green/DJ portion is hilarious"
so is jeff green... oh and JAMES HARDEN
Jeff Green with the Smashing Pumpkins tshirt. Nice
"How are you stopping Giannis tho ? Jeff Green ?  Like yeah, Giannis looks pretty stoppable in close playoff games ... when you have Bam/Crowder or Kawhi/Siakam."
"The Heat took the stars from Cleveland and Toronto to add with their own star. That's a superteam. The Lakers and AD forced NO to give up a star. Just like NO lost Chris Paul (almost to the Lakers) in a similar situation. To me, LeBron is a symbol to everything that makes the NBA weak. I applaud teams that can grow organically like Utah and Denver. I wished Dame had more help in Portland, because to me... he is doing the right thing.  Additionally, I dislike teams moving players that are about to hit their decline.... Like Boston and KG/Paul. I understand the logic, but still it is not something that I dislike.  As a fan... I still root for exThunder players most of the time. I feel a certain way about KD, but it would be nice for Jeff Green to win a ring. I would have been happier for Harden if he didn't do what he did to the Houston fan base. But that is just my dream version of the NBA... not that many people care"
This series is going the distance I don’t understand how people are saying this is gonna be a quick 5 game series when the Nets dropped a game to the hobbled Celtics. Losing Jeff Green was a huge blow man.
Well Jeff Green usually closes at the 5 for them and that’s not an option right now so there’s definitely more of a path to Brook closing games.
"With Jeff green playing the 5 and then the big 3 + Joe harris, Lopez probably wouldn’t be able to stay on defense wise. Without being able to play that lineup due to Green’s injury, i don’t see them being able to force Lopez out of the game"
KD and Jeff Green are also the only remaining players who played on the Sonics
For Jeff Green or Blake Griffin? Hell naw
Jeff Green has started at 5 like half the season. MDA is more or less the Nets coach lol
Yea it’s gonna be interesting with Lopez he played great against them in the regular season but might not be an option when it’s Jeff Green or KD at center instead of Blake/Claxton.
Lmao I just imagined Jeff Green guarding Giannis and Embiid
Jeff Green.
Jeff Green is probably the best center on the team
Sonics teammates. Jeff green played better that year. Thought those two would be great building blocks for years to come. They were pretty good for the next team
"I have no idea how important Jeff Green is to their team and if it'll even matter.  I know he's a decent defender.. but if Harden/Kyrie/KD are firing, does it even matter.  With that being said,   Bucks in 6"
Jeff Green out game 1  http://bleacherreport.com/post/milwaukee-bucks/2e17b27d-2289-4e66-b000-0316e549cf91
"D-Rose, DWade, Crowder, IT, LeBron, Love, Perkins, Hood, George Hill, Jeff Green. It was like a 2012 all-star game."
Jeff Green will do it
"&gt; Everyone likes home run hitters, but watch out for the Bucks. SOLID team.  This is both the Nets and Bucks - the Bucks have the reigning 2x MVP. Let's not pretend like they're Pistons-ing their way to the Finals just because they don't have a Big 3.  And the Nets have very good complementary players in Joe Harris, Blake, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green"
"We can switch 1-4.  We don't need to switch 5 until Blake Griffin or a hobbled Jeff Green prove they will make us pay.  if they do, we have a counter available."
"Brook is going to be an absolute liability on defense going against a team where all our rotation players can shoot the 3, especially if Jeff Green is back. The Nets will abuse him on switches."
"Jeff Green and Kevin Durant  I picture Green like Vince Carter, a veteran who hung on ten years past his prime bouncing from team to team while Durant seems young due to all the time he's missed due to injuries."
I think if Jeff green comes back then he’ll be in too
"Rondo and Danny green are left, and Jeff Green"
Rondo or Jeff Green
"Nets are missing Jeff Green, who while not a starter still plays significant minutes"
Plus Jeff Green off the bench player and Nash as a player coach
Knowing Nets luck. Jeff Green will heal miraculously. Wouldn't be modern basketball without the presence of some incredibly lucky superteam that made a deal with the devil.
&gt; Jeff Green for Mets  How many home runs and catches has he made?
"Nobody in the East is healthy too.      Donte is our for the Bucks, Jeff Green for Mets, Embiid for Philly. Maybe Hawks idk"
JEFF GREEN AND JAE CROWDEE ARE PLAYING IN EVERY GAME I TURN ON FOE THE LAST 10 YEARS.
Jeff Green is probably gonna be back tho
No it's not. Jeff Green plays for the nets.
"My fanfic for defending Giannis is just every one of the big 3 taking turns ISOing dude on offense until he's gassed and can't drive effectively.  Takes away his elite help defense and hopefully racks up fouls on him, since he has a tendency to commit offensive fouls too  Unfortunately, I think they're gonna be rotating DJ, Claxton, and KD on him if Jeff Green doesn't come back healthy. Harden has actually done a really good job in the past of helping on Giannis and getting steals/deflections in the post, so use that a bit too since he's a pretty bad perimeter defender unless it's an ISO"
I think Jrue was always gonna be on Kyrie. He's more of an iso scorer which is easier to take out with one good defender. Harden is in the PnR all the time.  But Jeff Green being out is I think bigger then Divincenzo being out.
"I think people have been both overrating the Nets so they can shit on them if they don't win and were underrating the Bucks all year. I don't think the Bucks are anywhere near the underdogs people implied earlier on. I'd call this a pickem series - it could 100% go either way. The Nets traded a lot to get Harden and only had the buyout market to plug the defensige holes.. and that didn't work out too well. They haven't had an offseason to make any other moves. They are definitely vulnerable to a complete team like the Bucks.   Obviously the Nets will get clowned on if they lose and if the Bucks do people will say it was expected, so they're almost playing with less to lose which is scary.   I think either way whoever wins this series wins the title. Wish Donte and Jeff Green were fully healthy to make it even better.  I am indeed hype."
"That would be true if the Harden trade was made last offseason vs during the season.   Nets lost Dinwiddie to injury and then gutted their depth for Harden.   Brooklyn had 3 open roster spots to fill with players that all 32 teams didn’t want to sign in Free Agency. Sure they got Blake but he’s nowhere near the player he was. Got lucky again with Aldridge and then he retires shortly after due to health reasons.   Nets had 3 open roster spots and they signed Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Alize Johnson. That’s not a plethora of riches once Aldridge retired.   Bucks had the advantage of putting their team together mostly in the offseason when the market still had quality talent in it to sign.   Nets this offseason have some options to build out their roster since they could have anywhere from 2-7 open roster spots.    Dinwiddie is most likely gone since he seems to want a larger role and his first real payday. Nets giving Dinwiddie around $18-20m per year (like he wants) would be like $35m a year when you add in the Luxury Tax.   Hopefully the Nets can work out a Sign and Trade so they can get a Trade Exception like the Celtics did with Hayward since Brooklyn is capped out.   Nets would also have the 2y/$7.4m Bi Annual Exception as well as the 3y/$18m Tax Mid Level Exception (which can be split I believe) to sign Free Agents this upcoming offseason.   Besides Dinwiddie the Nets also have Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC and Mike James as Free Agents.   I think Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are most likely to stay with Blake Griffin the next on the list. Mike James comes down to his Euro Team and if he’s released since I think Nets could re sign him because he’d be a cheaper backup PG option vs what Dinwiddie would want."
Bro I just fucking knew Divincenzo was gonna sky up for like 3 offensive rebounds a game over us I swear.  Sucks him and Jeff Green are hurt. One less guy for each team to throw at the other team on defense.
Nets lost Jeff Green which is even a bigger issue for them. He was supposed to go on Giannis and now they have to dust off Deandre
"In their primes, a lineup of Monte-Danny-Marcus-MPJ-Draymond with Markieff, Jeff Green, Gerald, and KPJ would be pretty fun.    Solid mix of defense, toughness, scoring, shooting, and switchable wings. Best bench in the league too."
I will always have a soft spot for him and Jeff Green for last season.
"What about the Grizzlies? What about the Pacers? What about the Spurs? Super competently run organizations that had close to a decade of success and have survived their teams getting blown up and quickly returning to the playoffs. You think they had any kind of chance to land KD, Kyrie or Lebron or AD? Fuck no.  One comes before the other. It’s a big market. THEN, it’s about the org. And, they got rid of all those players and fired the coach anyway. It’s not like the team resembles anything Marks was building before. They didn’t give a shit about that, they found out he wasn’t an idiot and made him clean house so they could install their friends like Steve Nash, D’Antoni, Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Harden to win easy rings in a big city."
green curry and jeff seth
"I agree completely. Tucker and Giannis can both ""guard"" Durant, Griffin, Jeff Green. That's big. Maybe the biggest question mark in this entire series right now is the playing time of Lopez? If he's hitting 3s or dominating the paint, the Bucks offense will be unstoppable. If the guards are able to embarrass him on D, you gotta think Bud will be pre-ready to get him tf outta there...."
"If Embiid is seriously hurt, that's a massive break for the Bucks or Nets.   But the rest are just silly excuses. Lakers going out is not as big a deal with Lebron and AD hobbled anyway. DiVincenzo being out is minor and not worth mentioning. Nets are missing Jeff Green too. But no one cares about this stuff when your stars are healthy."
"I disagree, I don't see how Lopez can stay on the court extended minutes or especially closing. He is too slow in PnR and this year has been falling into drop coverage. Won't work well vs Nets. Luckily they have better defenders like PJ, Pat, and Portis is even quicker. Donte injury really hurts but no Jeff Green hurts just as much"
"Uh I mean besides the talent drain, what has he really done wrong? The team is super young has two legit stars. Nobody wins anything before their prime anyway. Boston never got legit free agents before him. I blame him for holding on too rozier And mook in 2019, the Kemba situation (I mean who could have predicted that), and the Jeff green trade"
Once I waitressed for Jeff green and he wasn’t a good tipper so I guess were enemies?
"Agree with everything you've said. In reality, Nets side probably comes down to role players getting hot. We know the 3 will score, albeit at a lesser rate, but will Harris have a 7 3s game. Will Jeff Green have a game where he hits a few corner buckets. Will Claxton turn out to be a body that can successfully help build the wall on Giannis. Dude, been looking forward to this series (and the LAL/LAC series.............) the entire f'ing year"
"They're going to put Durant on Khris ala Tatum &amp; allow Giannis to get his against Blake, Jeff Green, and DJ."
Easiest ring in history. 3 people can cook you and if they play Jeff Green at center then you have a 5 out offense with Jeff and Joe and the corner spot.  You're going to have to give up some rebounding but that lane is gonna be so wide open.
Jeff Green has been in the league for 100 years you would be hard pressed to find players who don't have history with him
"Thought LeBron would have recruited Jeff Green, but I guess the Sonics/OKC connection with KD was too much for Uncle Jeff."
"seemed pretty obvious, i dont think seth curry or jeff green are the solutions to the lakers issues"
oh seth curry and jeff green please save me  give me a fucking break
"IIRC, Curry wanted to go to Dallas during that 2019 off-season, and we waited too long for Kawhi anyways. We should've gone after Jeff Green, but I believe KD called him up so it didn't matter. Knowing us, they probably would've regressed to 32% shooters though"
KCP is hurt but I can’t believe they didn’t pick up Seth Curry or Jeff green
"It's gonna be Harden and KD. They can't get by with 2 of the 3 being off. Kyrie will be what pushes them over and makes it ridiculous if he's also on, but a Joe Harris getting hot from 3 can replace Kyrie's production for the most part if Kyrie is off.  &amp;#x200B;  Either way, they ALL have to be guarded like they're #1 options. The offense is not really the concern.  &amp;#x200B;  The rebounding scares the shit out of me, and not having Jeff Green is spooky. Claxton looks good but he is going to get absolutely no love from the refs if he's on Giannis. Rightfully so, because KD and Harden are going to get a shitload of calls on the Bucks role guys too."
"Jeff Green is injured and Nicolas Claxton is basically a rookie who is still learning. Deandre is terrible, so we need to give Blake minutes."
Jeff Green is a huge loss for the Nets
Oh thank goodness that's plenty enough time for rest and Jeff green to possibly be available
nah you're better off with them winning tonight. That would mean no Jeff Green for game 1 and 2 probably.  If they lose it pushes the Bucks series and allows Green to complete his recovery in time.
"Missing Kemba, Jaylen, and Rob is only slightly more impactful than the Nets missing...Jeff Green and a Dinwiddie who hasn’t played all year?"
"Too bad our second best player, Jeff Green,  is out"
"Dinwiddie and Yes Jeff green, maybe Harden&amp; KD are also not coming off injuries"
You’re right Jeff Green is a much bigger deal than 3 of our starters
"&gt; If Boston gets another game or two I could see it really giving the Bucks a boost.  On the flipside, Jeff Green would be available for the series at that point."
"George Hill, Jeff Green, and TT were good vs Boston  And TT returned from injury vs Indy and was a difference maker   But yes overall his teammates really were bad. Hood and JC in particular."
Jeff green
"I get that random trivia about Jeff Green is pretty interesting, but we’re watching basketball"
Why is Jeff Green wearing an origami mask?
Beautiful commentary! What did you say? They aren't even listening to each other!  Plus that question was not even difficult. My elderly dog knew it was Jeff Green.
Can’t believe the lakers didn’t pick up Seth Curry or Jeff Green. Lebron knows what Jeff provides
"&gt; It's not like he's creating shots for his teammates like a Steve Nash or Jason Kidd;  Oh he absolutely is, I don't understand how you can say that without laughing at yourself.  Harden gets a ton of easy baskets in the PnR for his bigs or Jeff Green and a lot of drive and kick assists that come right out of his isolations to guys like Harris, KD, Durant, etc.  Him getting assist via their isos does happen, but he also creates a lot of shots for other guys and does create easier shots for both KD and Kyrie.  He also gets a lot of hockey assists with his drive and kicks."
"Me too man. He was one of my favorite players back on the Blazers and the first few years on the Spurs.   Also tbh the Nets with LMA would have been completely broken. Moves Blake to the bench along with Jeff Green, Claxton, Brown, Shamet, that's a lot of talent at that point."
"Ja Morant, Jeff Green, Jeremy Lin. Jeff Green plays with a lot of heart, despite his inaccuracy, and despite his heart ailments. Ja and Jeremy were overlooked to varying degrees."
I wonder if he talked to Jeff Green about it. Both of them can do so much good in terms of athletes and heart conditions.
Your first name is Jeff Green in anglicized Chinese?
Nets are gonna win. I don’t know why people are lying to themselves. Talent wins and not only is the big 3 really talented players like joe Harris and Jeff green are way more talented than most teams 5th and 6th option
Second best player that series was Jeff Green. What the fuck
Same with me and Jeff Green.
looking at the box scores and watching the games they’ve just been average. Which is all they really need in the current set up. I include Jeff Green because idk when he’ll be back
"Joe Harris ,Bruce Brown, Shamet, and Blake can all score lol. And Jeff Green. Obviously they won’t be called upon a lot to do so but these guys aren’t scrubs. As previously mentioned the real problem will  be in the paint"
"You slow? He was going against the kd warriors you dumbass, Jeff Green was often the second best player on his team in games"
"No, I'm saying whether or not Philly or Milwuakee takes them 7 has absolutely nothing to do with them losing 1 to Boston. They'll do it in an entirely different way if they do.  &amp;#x200B;  I actually think the Bucks have an equal chance of winning that series as the Nets. I've been extremely cautious about my predictions, especially since Jeff Green is out. Obviously he's not part of the ""big 3,"" but he was important as our center. Blake is going to get destroyed and Claxton is super, super green and will rack up fouls early"
"Is it really? I feel like people meme that for jokes, but the 2018 cavs still had like...proven vets up and down the roster. Doesn't mean lebron didn't play well or something to say his teammates were ok. He just didn't have a second all star. Which is 100% a valid excuse not to win the title.  Clarkson/shroeder  gasol/love  harrel/ thompson  caruso/george hill  Korver/jr smith  jeff green/kuzma  Like...those guys 2k ratings would be the same right?"
"No credit? I wish lol. He got criticism. I remember him being overly mocked for the way he played Jeff green, but it not only was the move that led to the cavs beating the Celtics but it also revitalized his career."
lakers are really missing 11 ppg kevin love and jeff green
Lmao.   Lowkey though Jeff Green is a good comp for him.
Kuz needs to thank the lord every day he got drafted by the lakers cus if it was any other franchise he’d be spending his time getting coffee for Jeff Green or something
"&gt;I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not “cheap”  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn’t the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn’t he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren’t cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren’t exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don’t have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don’t have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don’t trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don’t know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I’ll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there’s a high chance of us bringing back. So you’re talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that’s 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you’re in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that’s fine.   Now I don’t even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we’re talking about the Lakers."
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
Jeff Green??
"considering that they traded away their depth to get Harden, and that Jeff Green &amp; Dinwiddie are both out... I don't really see it as 98% without him. I'd put it at 85% _with_ Harden."
"I would start with looking at who Curry’s primary defenders are and see how often they guarded other players. That would give you a good start on rotations.  Looking at Game 1, nobody was directly on Curry for more than 2:30 and that defensive time was spread out, meanwhile Durant had LeBron and Jeff Green stuck to him."
"I don’t think KD will shoot that poorly again, and if Jeff Green comes back next game it’ll be different"
"The key difference was the Celtics traded to get Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. The Celtics traded Delonte West, Wally Szczerbiak, and Jeff Green to Seattle for Ray Allen and Glen Davis. The Celtics traded Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Ryan Comes, Theo Ratliff and two first-round picks to Minnesota for Kevin Garnett.  Chris Bosh went to Miami via sign-and-trade and LeBron James went to Miami as a free agent.  There's a meaningful difference here to me where an organization uses its assets to try to give themselves a window to compete for a championship vs the players themselves deciding to form to join up and form a super-team."
IMO most of the role players are a lot worse when Harden isn't playing.  Brown's looks are so much better when Harden runs the offense.  Jeff Green is like a completely different player when he's playing with Harden too.
definitely  you can't lose 3x to a Nets team without Harden and Jeff Green
"In easily the worst shooting night wherein KD/Kyrie/Joe Harris all shot like shit, without Harden and Jeff Green, Nets are up 3 in the last 2 minutes vs. the Bucks who were said to be the team with the best chance against them. Gonna go up 3-0"
Hamstring injuries are weird you can walk just fine but try landing on it or running full speed and you will have issues. Also it’s pretty likely we will see Jeff Green next game.
When is Jeff Green supposed to come back?
Jeff Green too
"They’re missing their 3rd superstar, Jeff Green"
Everyone saying Bucks in 6 like James Harden and Jeff Green aren’t on ice to close out the series if needed  Bucks can demolish the Nets these next 2 games and it shouldn’t matter
jeff green maybe?
He would instead just basically be Jeff Green as a player right now.  Thank God for Dwade
Starting lineup:  Russell Westbrook  Gary Payton ll  One of Kemps kids  Jeff Green  Kevin Durant  with head coach Nate McMillan
I mean without harden and jeff green there isn’t a huge talent discrepancy. Bucks have the two time mvp and two all star caliber players.   But yeah I agree. The most encouraging thing for me as a nets fan is how quickly nash was willing to change what we did all year. We adjusted our normal switching defense very quickly to adjust for Giannis and it’s been working well so far
Westbrook never played here but send us Jeff Green and KD back please.
Nah. Bucks win game 3 and the Nets are still a heavy favorite. Jeff Green and James Harden would likely be back for the deciding games if we need 5-6-7.
"Yeah if Jeff Green was there he'd have a bit of an excuse, but with Jeff Green sidelined, I see no reason why Giannis and the Buckeroos can't come back and win it all."
"And we have a ton of connections to him in the organization. Monty, Jeff Bower, Willie Green, etc."
"This year he finally got to cash in on all the assets he brought in (Levert, Jarrett Allen and would of been Dinwiddie too if he didn’t get injured) harden wouldn’t be a net if marks didn’t make it possible. Also trading for shamet, also signing Jeff green and Blake griffin add on to his case"
Jeff Green will not be denied.
"Idk man, I called Giannis a “bonafide role player, that plays like a slightly taller, worse jump shooting, high volume Jeff green”.   That’s as bad as it gets"
"In both the Suns-Nets games Ayton was eaten alive. He got destroyed by every single Big 3 and to make things worse he got beat off the dribble by old ass Jeff Green and Waluigi Shamet. Also Booker and CP3 are awesome on offense but questionable on defense. Booker dies on every screen and CP3’s foot speed isn’t what it was, although he’s still a super solid post defender for his size."
"Because he's still getting to his spots like normal. The shots haven't gone in. Maybe they'll go in, maybe they won't, but we don't have any reason to believe he can't shoot suddenly.      Giannis, the 2x MVP who is only an effective scorer at the rim, is being kept from the rim by one of the worst interior defenses in the league (not to mention the Nets are missing Jeff Green). I can't think of a more favorable matchup for him."
"That only happened because the CBA was greedy af and the salary cap rose way too much over one off-season. Every time had enough space to sign a max deal, defeating the purpose of the salary cap. That team existing wasn't the Warriors the fault or the leagues fault it was the players union and I feel like nobody mentions that.  I think the biggest issue with salaries rn is valuable veterans that take paycuts in order to win championships. A players cap hit should really be how much they are worth not how much they are paid. It slows the nets to get Blake, Jeff Green for way below their value which is more unfair. The nets were smart and got two stars in free agency and then made a fantastic trade giving up their future for the present."
"Yes. Along with Steve Nash, Mike d'Antoni, Amare Stoudemire, Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, and LMA if he wants."
It seems like defensively a player with Tatum's skills is harder for nets to defend compared to Gianni's... But nets did keep Tatum under control until Jeff green got injured so idk
"The Nets aren't even doubling Giannis, tf you mean ""focal point."" Blake Griffin is on him and sometimes KD. That's it.  &amp;#x200B;  Like, you're only a couple days removed from saying:  ""[And Giannis averages 40/11/5 against the Nets this season,and they’ll be without Jeff Green](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/noo2rc/brooklyns_big_three_scored_59_of_their_73_first/h016h9j?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)""  &amp;#x200B;  what happened"
"He’s a bonafide role player that can dunk to get points. He’s basically a taller, worse jump shooting Jeff Green"
Jeff green probably. He’s been one of the most impactful role players for us and on both ends...the Nets just hobbled their way into this series and are beating up the Bucks. It’s unbelievable to see even for Nets fans
5 out with Jeff Green is not gonna prevent Gobert from dominating the boards or someone defend him down low.  20/20 average confirmed.
"OP also add: ""With Jeff Green out, they have nobody to put on Giannis and Blake will get eaten alive."
"&gt;less depth   Oh no!!! They only have Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Mike James, Claxton, Jeff Green, and Shamet! How will they ever survive??  Harden has been injured for 2 games. If you wanna crown them for being up 2-0 on a perennially shit playoff team, go ahead. They haven’t done anything yet. 4 games with Harden, 2 without and y’all already want to say this is the hard road for Brooklyn lol."
5 out with Jeff Green and that plan is done
Jeff Green and KD carrying those final SuperSonics torches.  Does this mean Seattle are up 2-0 in this series?
"It also helped that Game 3 in Boston was Brooklyn’s first without Jeff Green, I thought his absence was glaring.  They adjusted by Game 4 though."
dude i hella wish LMA was still on the team  and that Spence didn't get injured  woulda been FUCKING sick to watching a KD/Kyrie/Harden + LMA/blake/spence/jeff green and full team holy fuck
People really do be disrespecting Jeff Green like this
They are playing without Harden and the assets they traded for Harden and without Jeff Green
"A Giannis-Middleton-Jrue core is still a great place to be ""stuck"". And just look at the teams remaining: Austin Rivers, Campazzo, Torrey Craig, Blake Griffin, Mike James, Jeff Green, etc. There are always vet min/buyout/overseas/etc. role players that can make in impact in the right system, and it's a lot easier to attract those guys when you have 3 All Star caliber players locked up"
"Of course Harden plays and it's Jeff Green's comeback that keeps the Nets in the game to allow for KD's legendary performance, who didn't see that coming?  Milwaukee was going through a stretch where they just kept getting easy bucket after easy bucket, and the only thing that kept the game from being an utter blowout was Green just pouring in 3's.  He was 6/6 during that run, and Milwaukee was still maintaining a ~15 point lead during it. And that's with 3's from Blake was well. He was 3/4 when Green was 6/6, so a combined 9/10, 27 points on 10 possessions.  Without that we would've been looking at an absolute blowout and been robbed of KD's carry job."
Jeff Green and Joe Harris combined were average
“That was for Seattle.” -KD and Jeff Green
"This has been your annual Jeff Green game, thank you for joining us"
Is Jeff Green the greatest player of all time?
"All of a sudden Jeff Green is so highly rated, lmao. Relax nephew."
THEY JUST LOST TO DURANT AND JEFF GREEN WTF
"You can probably win with this Bucks team, but you need to play Giannis more like Ben Simmons on defense. If you're going to win with this team, you need to maximize Giannis's defensive impact, and having him play free safety while leaving Jeff Green open for threes isn't it.  Bud made the year too late adjustment of putting Giannis on Butler against the Heat last round. Now this round he won't put Giannis on KD. It was a criminal coaching job tonight to not have Giannis start guarding KD after Tucker showed he couldn't stop him at all."
Jeff Green has evolved into Jeph Green
so when do you think Harden and Jeff Green switch bodies back?
"Jeff green shooting like game 6 klay isn't gonna happen again, I feel like KD basically used all his energy on this game which is why I say bucks in 7"
Dude they were up almost 20 and lost to Kd and Jeff Green. Kd can have 50. That doesn’t mean he should be beating the bucks by himself like he pretty much did. For some reason the let him keep going 1v1 even though he was torching everyone and no one on the nets beside Jeff Greem was making anything. And the offense pretty much became iso party as the game was obviously slipping away from them. So yes the bucks shit the bed.
The bucks let Jeff green run through them while  James harden went 1/10 from the field and 0/8 from three and your saying it’s rigged ...?
Jeff green went 7/8 from 3
Jeff Green had 27 and KD had the best game of his career   That happens if you are up 20 lol
Wow Durant and Jeff Green…what could’ve been for the Seattle SuperSonics…
"Jeff Green and destroying my hopes in playoff games, name a better duo"
On the last KD bucket Jeff Green and Harden were in the same corner doing nothing as KD boogied on Kris Middleton in iso with Jrue Holiday just watching and not doubling.  Wtf are we doing.
Jeff Green was unreal.
Jeff Green: My first name is actually Robin.
"Underrated contributions by Jeff Green from deep and on the defensive side of the ball, however, only the 2nd best former SuperSonic on the Nets tonight"
Jeff Green and Blake Griffey played pretty well.
They would’ve been up way more than 17 but Jeff Green went nuclear that happens...
"Fuck it, Nets new Big 3 is KD, Blake Griffin, and Jeff Green"
Middleton had momentum already. Look at it again. Giannis wasn't even ready. Middleton and giannis both choked. Finishing over Jeff Green is 10/10 a foul
"The real nets big 3 is Durant, Jeff green, and gianiss for taking all those terrible shots down the stretch"
We're going to build a statue to him here in Brooklyn.  Columbus Day is now Jeff Green Day. We'll get Green Day to play.
"Amazing performance by Jeff Green, looked like he couldn't miss a shot, 7/8 from 3"
"MVP goes to Jeff ""Joe Harris"" Green"
Shout out to Jeff Green
Career game from Jeff Green?
lmao KD and jeff fucking green shat on the bucks.
"KD went off, legendary game. Jeff Green also had an insane game, his contribution was important as well as all it would’ve took was one of them not to be lights out and the Bucks win this despite how bad their second half was."
"Bud sold the bag. I don't think any other coach in the playoffs loses this game. It's honestly baffling that Jeff Green had 27. Doesn't matter if KD has 50, you lose when you let Jeff Green drop 27."
Jeff Green hit 7 3's in a row.  You can't make this shit up...lol
"Nobody knows when it's going to happen, but a couple times a year Jeff Green fucking erupts."
Kevin Durant. Jeff Green.
"Even though KD had arguably the best performance before the Finals, Jeff Green was absolutely tremendous tonight."
Great game by Jeff Green and KD! That's what we expect of superstars in playoffs!
wow i didn’t even realize Jeff Green got 24. He was money all night
"There is nothing super about one leg harden, Jeff green, Blake griffin and Kevin durant lol"
Knockdown shooter Jeff Green
It's okay Jeff Green doesn't always get 27 in a game. Bucks still in control.  ^^^Right?
Jeff FUCKING Green
Jeff Green makes a big difference. Put some respect on his name.
The Bucks lost to Kevin Durant and Jeff Green.  Jeff Green.  Jeff Green.  I get he's decent but he's Jeff Green.  Jeff Green.
Sonics legend Jeff Green
"i’m jeff green, yall know who i am"
Shoutout to Jeff Green too. If he has an average game from 3 the Nets lose this.
"Say what you want about KD with the legendary performance, but  Jeff Green with 27 off the bench going 7-11, all but 1 make from 3  I dont see him doing that again"
At that point it's pretty much who I like better Jeff Green or Rondo
Jeff Green Light
jeff green on both phones
The decisions didn’t cost the bucks the game   They didn’t help but the bucks lost cause KD and Jeff Green potentially had the best games of their career while someone on the Bucks played 35 minutes and did near nothing.
Durant with legendary performance but lets not forget Jeff Green impact. This dude hasnt played for months and stepped up while harris shit the bed.
[KD and Jeff Green tonight](https://i.imgur.com/VLjQl5G.gifv)
Jeff Green actually did bail them out.
Great game by Jeff Green and KD! That's what we expect of superstars in playoffs!
"Space Jam 3: the monstarrs kidnap Kyrie Irving, and in a last effort he channels his energy into Jeff Green"
"Jeff ""Klay Thompson"" Green"
Smh Kd can't win without another superstar like Jeff Green.
"Kevin motherfucking Durant, with some help from Jeff green, carried this team to a win. Unreal"
Dont forget jeff green too.. he was a beast today with durant
Look at Jeff Green he is Steph Curry now
"Told a friend he'd go God mode tonight and boy did he deliver. Jeff Green was a surprise. I don't want the Nets to win the championship but I won some money off this, so I'll take it."
The Nets need to get Jeff Green some help
"Lol nets new Big 3 is kd, Jeff Green, and the refs"
Jeff Green with 27 wtf
"Overshadowed was jeff green, he came through for nets"
The KD game we wanted to see really happened y'all! Oh and Jeff Green too
"Durant aside, JEFF GREEN!"
Jeff Green saved KD’s legacy.
Don’t know why Bud is hiding Giannis in the corner on fucking Jeff Green while KD kills Tucker/Lopez/KM. Rudy robbed of that DPoY  And only fucking ISO’s during the second half
KD and Jeff fucking Green!
Some dude tried to tell me Harden was better than Jeff Green
"The Bucks really fumbled this one. Giannis Antetofumble at the end there. And Harden should've just rested, who knew it just took Durant going nuclear with some help from Jeff Green  Seriously, what a fucking game from Durant, playing every minute to get 49 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists, goddamn. Absolutely put the team on his back this game. Maybe the death of the Brooklyn Nets were greatly exaggerated"
"Bucks weren't ready for the new and improved Nets' Big 3.   KD, BG, and Jeff Green."
"Welp there's your KD legacy game. And shoutout to Jeff 'Stephen Curry' Green, man was automatic from three tonight."
"93/21/13 on 70/60/85 splits   What an amazing showing from Brooklyn's Big 3 of KD, 32-year-old Blake Griffin and soon to be 35-year-old Jeff Green"
he’s a mean jeff green machine
Bruh Jeff Green and KD &gt; Bucks entire roster apparently
Jeff Green is the best small ball 5 per dollar.
"Jeff ""Chef"" Green"
Jeff Green loves to have one or two games where you genuinely think he’s all star caliber
Wasn’t even Kd and the nets lol it was Kd and Jeff Green
gotta give props to Jeff Green... he gave the team momentum and he made his shots.
&gt;Jeff Green must be exhausted carrying this team for 48 minutes.
Jeff green (Steph Curry) is making them pay a lot.
"Nets had the refs, two mvps, and Jeff Green and could still barely beat Budenholzer 😹😹 frauds much?"
Healthy bucks team got beat by kd and Jeff Green lmao
I don't think James Harden will play this badly again but I am not sure if Jeff Green and Blake Griffin can keep shooting like that either.
Jeff Green and Blake were hitting all their shots tonight.
Rather lose to Jeff Green than ducking Reggie Jackson
Jeff green with the hilariously illegal screen
Bud should most definitely get fired after this game for allowing Jeff green to drop 27.
 KD and Jeff green did not wanna lose this game
lol Jeff Green 7-8 from 3  Celtics Legend
"&gt;Jeff Green, his presence  Ah yes, using the force push."
Bucks really lost to Jeff Green
Jeff green had the greatest game of his career
Blake Griffin and Jeff Green being more effective than Joe Harris this series is the basketball equivalent of finding 10 dollars in your old pants pocket
Blake didn’t take the layup but passed to a half open jeff green with the shot clock running out
People forget that it took Jeff Green and KD going nuclear to win by a small margin last game. This will go to a game 7 luckily for us
Yeah no Jeff Green today lol
Jeff green already missed more 3’s than he did in game 5
Giannis better go right at Jeff green
"Oh yeah I'm sure Jeff Green will definitely put up those numbers on a consistent basis, seems incredibly likely."
Shoutout Jeff Green
Uncle Jeff Green has many nephews
I'm saying you don't need Harden when you have flamethrower Jeff Green. Double KD? Not when Uncle Jeff is on the court.
"Even if the Bucks win the series, it won’t look at it in an impressive way tbh. Nets are literally hobbled, playing a Harden who would be better off healing still. And they lost the last game to some stupid mistakes and offense (Not to discredit KD and Jeff Green)."
As someone who loves Jeff Green he usually doesnt have these elite games back to back
Jeff Green gonna pop off for 30 today
Maybe Jeff green can shoot his season average 77% from three on 9 shots
"This right here. Brook Lopez a very talented post scorer in the C position, being guarded by people like Durant and Jeff green and he doesn't get any touches in the post."
You mean the Jeff Green that scored 27 on 7/8 3p?
crazy since Jeff Green (also KD’s friend) has been playing so well the whole season and he’s only getting the Vet Min
We hit 13 you guys hit 16 it was 40% vs 37% it’s not that big of a difference. Harden obviously had no business being out there and it’s clear he wasn’t ready he just didn’t want to lose which I understand but I don’t see how he’s going to be any more ready tonight than he was 2 days ago with playing 45 minutes. Harris hasn’t shown up yet in this series and I doubt he starts tonight in Milwaukee. Jeff Green is a good player but not a 6/7 from 3 and 27 pts good to do it every night.
"Why do people keep saying this Jeff Green revert to the mean shit like Joe and Harden won’t do the same, you guys shot better from 3 that game and still lost"
It really depends on how Harden is. I don’t see KD having another game of his life and I sure as shit don’t see Jeff Green hitting 6/7 3s.   But if harden is still going slow I don’t see how we could possibly lose tonight but then again I didn’t see how we could lose game 5 when we were up at half.
"I hate Ben's lack of shooting but do you know what I hate even more? Giannis taking jumpers vs the Nets. Kills me. He's basically Ben with a wingspan + aggressive mentality, fucking Jeff Green going to carry Nets to the Title.      I'm sorry, still coping with the loss"
"False equivalency mixed with modern knee jerk overreactions   -Every title team doesn’t win it overnight. There’s this little thing called “adversity”. Yet nowadays if a team doesn’t win in 2 years it’s ‘blow it up’  -If Jamal Murray is healthy they would be favorites over Utah and Phoenix (I had Denver winning it all after the Gordon trade)  -If harden doesn’t get better, and if Kyrie is confirmed out, the Bucks STILL may be top favorites to win it all! Like relax a little bit. Forget the Durant performance, they also got 27 on 7 3s from Jeff green! It isn’t crazy at all that they would beat BK. And if so, I think they would be favored vs every single team remaining (with Kawhi likely done)  -Sixers just have a Ben Simmons problem. Need him gone. If Embiid stays healthy, they’ll be fine"
i agree with the trapping. but the bucks actually did do that as well. Shamet played the roll man pretty well and so did jeff green. We got buckets out of those possessions. I still think that might be ur best move but the nets have decent personnel in green/harris/shamet/harden to attack that.
"I think that’s the game plan for most of those teams, even the Nets right now with their injuries. You have to realize, KD is going to get his. You need to walk in the game and spot him 30 and say “ok now let’s make Joe Harris, let’s make Blake, let’s make Jeff Green beat us.”  That’s how you have to plan and same goes with Giannis. Spot him 20+ and say okay now let’s make sure Jrue, Brook and Khris have a bad game."
"&gt;The nets have no bigs. Giannis could legit average 40 this series  The Nets are playing a soft wall on defense, double and triple teaming him around the rim when he drives. He can't score more without forcing it or taking more midrange shots / 3s.  &gt;I will reiterate: KD. Gets. More. Hate. Than. Giannis. This is not debatable.   Saying it like that doesn't make it a fact. It is debatable and it's actually false. KD gets more hate overall, like a month ago, because people hate him after he left OKC, not in postgame threads or during series even when he has bad games.  That Jeff Green block isn't even posted I think lmao. And he had like 2-3 similar blocks. Meanwhile, a shitty Blake dunk on him went viral. KD's midrange after a crossover (which he still contested very well) also. Kyrie's pull up on him as well. He has an awesome and 1 on KD last game - not even posted. You are not paying attention. He literally got more hate after game 5 than Embiid did after is 0/12. The hate Giannis gets is LBJ level and he hasn't done anything like KD has."
"Bro 9/25 isn’t great but it’s not “atrocious”, it happens occasionally. KD’s still averaging what, 33 ppg on 55/45/90 splits this postseason? Something along those lines?   The reason people aren’t impressed with giannis 30 ppg on 57% TS this series, which are good numbers on their face, is those numbers should be even HIGHER. The nets have no bigs. Giannis could legit average 40 this series. There’s a reason he was so successful against them in reg season, and even then the nets were prob a bit better equipped to defend him with a legit big on the court (DJ).   The reason those are the most upvoted Giannis highlights is 10 second violation is something that never happens so the fact that it happens to a star player is funny. That shit would be mass upvoted no matter what if any top 30 player had it happen. And also, what are his big time highlights this series? Like he’s had a couple nice dunks, and that nice block on Jeff green last night, but it’s not like there were any eye popping moments a la KD’s off balance shot clock beating three in the clutch.   I will reiterate: KD. Gets. More. Hate. Than. Giannis. This is not debatable. I honestly think the reason Giannis is especially getting some hate this playoffs is, A. It’s been three straight years of disappointing postseason games for Milwaukee, and part of that is on Giannis, and B. Most people are rooting for the bucks, and they’re disappointing everyone. You know why most people are rooting for the bucks? Because they believe Giannis is more likeable than Kevin durant. At this point nets winning would be more of a feel good story considering the injuries they’ve  faced but people will celebrate if giannis and the bucks win tonight regardless."
"Except it was his presence on the court that provided spacing for KD, they don't win that game if KD is doubled or tripled the entire game because the only other guy providing spacing is Jeff Green"
Let's see Jeff Green hit 7/8 from deep again.  I've got Bucks by 10.
As a Nets fan I’m already blessed but I can’t help but imagine a starting line up of Kyrie/harden/Durant/Allen w Bruce brown/joe Harris/Jeff green as the fifth man
KD Vs Paul George is your answer. 70-80% harden with Jeff green shooting like deadshot is why.
"Yeah, I don't think it was possible or likely earlier. As I recall, Pierce was fed up and starting to demand a trade from the Celts if they couldn't surround him with better talent. Celts traded for Ray Allen with the Jeff Green pick. Originally, KG was not OK with being traded to Boston, but OK'ed it after they acquired Allen. People were also suspect on the return the Twolves got for KG considering Mchale was in charge in Minny at the time..."
"And throwing spinning elbows from hell, happens multiple times every single game (last game the biggest victim was Jeff Green)   Every time he picks up his dribble he chicken wings his arms and flares out his elbows and goes full tornado mode, trying to KO anyone who's in range to contest"
"Newly-healthy forward Jeff Green yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Joe Harris gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Landry Shamet yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Kyrie hit the locker room door, former NBA great Tim Duncan hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Jeff green is Piccolo
Jeff Green when another teammate has to play 48 minute turns into the greatest role player in the planet apparently. He turned it up in Game 7 against Boston when LeBron played every minute too
"Lots of people thought this would be a competitive series, even the Nets being fully healthy. People thought the Bucks matched up very well, and they get proceed to get blown out against the Nets with no harden   Now the Nets are struggling to stay on the court, and they still dropped a game to them. It’s KD but the support casting is worlds apart  Literally Jrue, Middleton, Lopez, PJ vs Blake, Jeff green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown"
Jeff Green is a beast
Bro it was so funny in Game 5 in the fourth when he stood there trying make a move only to pass it then get it right back and literally runs right into Jeff Green for a charge
"Exactly. It’s absolutely FUCKING INFURIATING watching the Bucks in the 4th. Fuck even in the 3rd. It’s just mind boggling the offensive scheme. Like are the Bucks just full of low IQ players? I don’t think so because they have shown FLASHES and moments where they do some crazy fucking good shit. In those moments they are a team that is unstoppable. Take for example the first half. They had the Nets where they wanted them, even surviving the Jeff Green show and KD getting whatever he wanted."
"Considering that was one of, if not the best game of his life no I don’t think he will this series.   Besides even if he does Jeff green isn’t going 6/7 from 3 again."
"&gt; Jeff Green absorbed Joe Harris's powers and turn into Game 6 Klay Thompson  He had a more efficient shooting night from 3 than any playoff game Klay played in his life. Klay's best efficiency from beyond the arc that post-season was 6 of 9 against the Blazers, and he's had a few 5 of 6 type games in other years. Game 6 vs OKC Klay basically pulled a Steph going 11 for 18, which is both an all time high in makes and attempts for him from beyond the arc during the playoffs. I guess it just feels like he couldn't miss because the barrage came at the right time during the game."
Yeah but if you double the Nets will make you pay. Good rotations can help but double teaming against a team with shooters like Jeff Green and Joe Harris will burn you.
Light Skin Rudy Gay and Flat Top Jeff Green
"He stepped up. Harden was the one legged decoy but you needed a third option to step up, most would probably think of Blake, shamet or even harris before they think Jeff green"
2018 did not have individually good players.  Second best was Jeff Green playing worse than he is now in Brooklyn
"Nets didn't have Jeff Green and 1.5 max player the entire series so it's hardly an excuse.   I do agree it's bigger than people give it credit because the Bucks right now have perfect defensive coverage but zero reserves. So if Jrue has foul trouble you don't have any reasonable replacement, and same goes for PJ. It immediately makes their defense suspect."
"You mean if harden can jump in to Jeff green, flop like a fish and get a foul"
They're playing Jeff green at center lol and watch lopez at deep drop it literally gives KD open middys everytime. Also also the solution is to play neither that much and play giannis at the 5 which has killed Brooklyn but bud barely does it
"Between Reggie and Jeff Green this playoffs, I'm shook... Everything I believed to be true is upside down."
"We know Giannis, KD and probably even Harden are going off. The question is what will Khris, Jrue, Brook, Blake, Jeff Green and Joe Harris do."
"That doesnt mean you would have won if Kyrie had come back and played. Fully healthy Kyrie is also better than gimpy James Harden. Jeff Green did great but he was the only guy who helped KD that game and it took 49 points from KD.  3s arent the only things that matter. This has been a defensive, physical series since like game 3 with two of the best offensive players on the Nets being hobbled.  Bucks clearly have more talent as the Nets are top heavy. You are making disingenuous points to make your team look good. If one of Kyrie or Harden were actually healthy you guys would probably lose in  5. If both were this might be a sweep and you know that.  Also Harden is better than Kyrie LOL."
"&gt;When it was just KD and Kyrie you guys were getting killed.  I mean we're 2-2 in games with both lol.  We were winning game 4 before Kyrie went down.   But still its not like KD hasn't had help lol.  Jeff Green hit 7/8 from 3 in Game five.  Blake is shooting like 40%.   Nets have guys that are on fire from 3.  Nets have like 10 guys shooting above .300 from 3.  The Bucks only have 2 guys shooting over .275.   Teams have good and bad shooting nights/streaks, and that's largely been the story of the series so far.     Nets are a good team even in their current shape.  So are the Bucks.  If you disagree with either statement you're either overreacting to recent performance / media narratives or just not watching the games lol"
"I think that the Clippers are a perfect storm of personnel and shooting, to the point that most teams out there can't replicate their scheme or strategy.  During the regular season, Beverley was their worst 3 point shooter at 39.7% (on sufficient volume). That is, they had 8 players (and Mann) who shot super efficiently. Batum and Morris can both play small ball 5.   To my knowledge, they and the Nets the only team out there with that combination of efficiency at all positions without completely sacrificing defensive ability, and the Nets have fewer viable players (7 good shooters with KD and Jeff Green as bigs). The Bucks have inefficient or average shooting bigs, and even the Rockets a few years ago had Tucker be league average. For the Warriors, Draymond was above average from 3 for one season but worse otherwise. Last year's Lakers weren't this efficient across the board either."
Tbf the Nets needed Jeff Green and Blake to have insane games as well to win the other night
Jeff Green has been an incredible role player as well. His maturity and experience has really helped the team a lot.
jeff green is a star role player if that makes sense
Imo 2018 was when the coaching disparity was most notable and that team had lebron but not much else. Celtics were much more athletic and really a nightmare matchup and lue whipped out... Jeff green as a small ball 5. It not only won the series but it revitalized Jeff greens career.
I'ma go ask Jeff green if he gonna be a star
"I know y'all are clowning this man already but even this year, the Nets are running rotations with their ""bigs"" being KD, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin for these entire playoffs"
Don't forget Clippers legend Jeff Green.
"I feel like the Bucks are actually a lot better but I don't trust them at all.   Ima say Bucks win but the Nets could definitely pull it off.   The Bucks might win just because of how hard it is for Brooklyn to score. They need KD to carry and for their role players to play well. Jeff Green, Joe Harris, James Harden, Blake. Shamet even. They gotta do shit.   The Bucks just need Middleton to show up and for the Nets not to hit too many threes.  Hope I'm wrong though. Middleton has struggled in away games."
"Yup, and we just happened to get the version of Jeff Green that didn't want to commit to the team."
Getting the most out of Jeff Green is an enigma. I bet next year he sucks for the Nets.
"I think that's a great idea, and we did try that last year with Jeff Green and Emmanuel Mudiay, but it didn't work out. With that said, those players will need to agree to play in an unattractive market where they may not get significant play time."
You have to “tinker” when your entire starting roster is traded multiple times and your guys are injured all year. Our ideal starting 5 never played together in the regular season in 2018. Some of those tinkerings would also pay off in the playoffs like the TT/Jeff Green lineup that everyone thought was idiotic. He tries lots of lineups to keep people familiar with each other and see how to play people together. It’s his best quality as a HC even if it costs some random regular season games.
"I really think he has to go as a 3 because that's what he played for a large portion of his career, but iirc he's playing the 4 (and 5? Or is he just doing jump balls? I don't know) for Brooklyn so that would solidly make Giannis the second best PF in this matchup (unless we count Celtics legend Jeff Green)"
fr people already forgot about prime jeff green
"First, we had the annual Jeff Green game. Now we have the Terance Mann game. The NBA just keeps on giving."
"Jeff Green had 7/9 threes the other day, if you don’t know him, he could be the next Klay Thompson"
OP was asking for a random outburst. I don’t think people were expecting Jeff Green to come up big when he’s been known to be inconsistent. You could even say what he did in game 5 was unexpected too.
Jeff green is now the Mann game
This is what the NBA is now.  Can you get someone like Jeff Green to go 7/8 from 3 like Nets game 5 or Mann to go 7/10 this game.
Jeff Green being clutch for LeBron?  FVV 2019 taking his game to a new level  Siakam 2019 as well
NEXT MANN UP  Everyone ignored Nets won game 5 because Jeff Green went 7/8 from 3 cause shooting 87.5% is common.
That Jeff green bounce
"&gt;both ends  oops I forgot, he's taking on the absolutely critical defensive assignment of guarding Jeff Green"
George Hill and Jeff green played good with LeBron though.
Jeff Green has always been solid
Jeff Green was great with LeBron though
"I don’t mean stop, I mean tire out. I’d throw Blake, Jeff Green, and DJ just to tire him out physically since they’re all big bodies. Embiid will get his but the strategy would be to hope he slows down in the 4th"
the jeff green can’t win with these cats in the game 5 was the funniest shit ever
"thanks man, its been 14 years im completely numb to it now. i actually like the sixers team, but i cannot stand ben simmons. rooting for bkn cuz of kd and jeff green but if kd doesnt get fmvp, fuck the nets."
Jeff Green or Ariza.
Seth “Jeff Green” Curry
People throwing around this “injured Nets” like when they had Kyrie and KD they still were a better team than we had. The only time that excuse can be used is now and that’s really depending on how much Harden has improved tomorrow. It took Jeff Green having an amazing performance and KD having an all time performance to barely beat us game 5. Other than game 2 which was an amazing performance that won’t likely happen again (50% from 3 and 52% FG) they’ve barely beat us.
What you did was basically the equivalent of when Jeff Green was compared to Siddon on draft night 😂
Not as important as Kyrie or harden but as important as Jeff green or dinwiddie.
"I doubt harden will be regular for next game.   I think how Joe Harris plays will be a pretty big factor if they win. The Nets just need a second person to hit shots to give KD a break, and take advantage of any drop coverage help they play   Jeff green was it for game 5. But Joe Harris can easily be that guy if he stops slumping"
"i’m not arguing that, but if he’s gonna be playing 30+ minutes providing nothing but bricks and bad defense we’re going to lose unless we get saved by jeff green again lmao. joe is a joke."
Friendship with Jeff Green ended. PJ Tucker is my new friend now.
I'd rather have Jeff Green alone for Jeff Green money than have Fournier for Fournier money. Bradley and Olynyk back on top would be awesome
"If he leaves Brooklyn, Jeff green will have been on 9 different teams since 2016"
Jeff Green has been playing on the min the last 4 seasons...id be surprised if all of a sudden is valuing money a lot more now.
"Jeff ""East Coast Batum"" Green  he seems to be the perfect fit for every team, everybody seems to want him, only one team can have him"
That’s a big loss for the nets if Jeff Green leaves.
"I would rather have Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley &amp; Jeff Green."
Jeff Green welcome back
Celtics legend Jeff Green
"Yup, 2018 was when it kinda peaked when they added Crowder, D-Rose, Wade, Jeff Green and Calderon among others."
"I'd be kind of surprised if he doesn't re-sign with the Nets for their TPMLE.  but who knows, Jeff Green is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma"
They got their own version of Batum they have to worry about retaining.  I don't think Jeff Green is re-signing for the minimum again.
give me Jeff Green or give me death
"I think we can do so much better than Melo. There are so many quality PFs available in free agency: Jeff Green Batum, JaMychal Green, Craig, Millsap, Kieff. All these guys can play as small ball 5s (which isn’t a huge need with AD but still valuable I think)"
Of course. I wasn't trying to say they were the same quality of player. But Jeff Green is another one of those guys who you would think a team would like to retain since he's been solid for most of his career (besides some injuries)
"Yeah, splitting hairs, but I put Billups so much higher than Green (even though I love Uncle Jeff)"
Would you rather give it to Blake or Jeff Green? Both were extremely important imo
Wouldn't be that crazy for them to not have 2. And Jeff Green played like a superstar one game too 🤷‍♂️
"Wasn’t there talks of a Jeff Green curse a few years back? Not that he can’t win a ring, but teams can’t win a ring because of him."
"Yeah but Ben Simmons will be enough for KD, no? Brooklyn might as well add Jeff Green for that"
I love Jeff green. He torched Boston in game 7 when he was playing in place of Kevin love.
"Along with Patty Mills, Avery Bradley, Rudy Gay, DeMar DeRozan, Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Bullock  Did i miss anyone"
because jeff green is brons good friend  he was brons right hand man on cavs 2018
yeah man i'm sure jeff green is going to go to the lakers for this mythical additional shot a game at best that you're conjuring.... cant wait to hear what melo and gay and whoever the fuck else the lakers are apparently signing have to say about that!
Jeff Green would be perfect for this team
They’re potentially losing Blake Griffin and Jeff Green though who have been great in that role so probably a net even there
"Danny Green, Jeff Green and JaMychal Green should all form a Mecha-Green and see if they can take out the Suns"
Not the retirement home Celtics who were missing key depth like Jeff Green lol that series was only close cause Bosh was also out
Didn't they do crutches too for Jeff Green?
I believe this only applies to LeBron. LeBron with George Hill and Jeff Green needs to beat the Warriors
Harden Irving Dinwiddie and Jeff Green\*
He never had the full team against the Bucks it was him &amp; Kyrie kicking their ass now it’s him without Harden or Kyrie. Bucks still have Middleton &amp; Jrue with Giannas. If Giannas lost them two y’all wouldn’t be saying this nonsense. Lebron wasn’t expected to beat better teams with less talent only idiots like Skip Bayless criticized him for losing to GS. The better team will win the series. KD is a better player than Giannas that isn’t up for debate. But if he’s out there with Mike James and Jeff Green while the Bucks have Middleton and Jrue it’s not an indictment on KD. Now if Harden returns it’s balanced. Kyrie had a boot on he’s probably done.
Steph Klay KD Draymond Looney vs....  George Hill JR Jeff Green Bron and KLove  Game 1 was a summary of the series and that season for Bron. He puts on one of the greatest individual performances ever to only be screwed over by his garbage team.
"How can he prove himself when he has a skeleton team around him? The Nets traded away all their assets for Harden.  Joe Harris is probably their best starter, elite 3pt shooter, not a black hole on defense. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are decent, but average for a starter. Deandre Jordan is just ok, efficient offensively, and catches lobs but he's easily exploited on defense. Everyone else is below average or terrible.  Bruce Brown is actually decent offensively, but as a PG he's pretty shit, can't facilitate worth a damn despite playing significant minutes. Mike James is a much better facilitator as a PG, average 3pt shooter, but absolutely trash in the paint, not a threat running to the rim so defenders just guard him at the key. Claxton is too inexperienced and has no idea what's going on half the time. TLC been trash at the perimeter this season, isn't great on either end of the floor. Shamet is a good volume 3pt shooter, isn't great at the rim, shit defense, a decent player off the bench actually but not starting caliber on any team. Chiozza is like 5'9, can't shoot, gets shit on in the paint, but is a good facilitator.  With KD, Kyrie, and Harden, this is an blowout championship team, with KD and either Kyrie or Harden, this is a legitimate contender. With just KD, this is a play-in team at best lol. Wayyy too top heavy to be able to afford 2 of their 3 stars out."
Jeff green
Some interesting duos of the tonight's game between the Nets and the Bucks.     |Duo|Score (for the Bucks)| |:-|:-| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton|82-51| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Pat Connaughton|53-26| |Khris Middleton + Pat Connaughton|56-31|  &amp;#x200B;  |Duo|Score (for the Nets)| |:-|:-| |Jeff Green + Landry Shamet|15-6| |Kyrie Irving + Jeff Green|8-0| |Jeff Green + Nicolas Claxton|27-21|
And 3rd in Jeff Green just got back and is on limited minutes
When your next 2 best performing are Jeff Green and Bruce Brown I’d think you deserve at least a little slack
If KD was mad Steph and klay were taking his shots Imagine how made he is that Bruce brown and Jeff green are freezing him out lmao
"Lmao ""no excuses"" when Kyrie Irving and James Harden are hurt, Jeff Green playing his 1st game   Trash."
Is Blake also out with injury? Or does Nash just love Jeff Green more?
Jeff Green is pure ass.
"A superteam of KD, Mike James, and Jeff Green?  Also, they beat them twice...series is 2-1.  Is this a satirical post?"
&gt;Allen plays a position where frankly they don't really need any more depth than they have.  There is a massive difference between Allen at the 5 and Blake/Jeff Green.
Jeff Green has a face where he could be any age between 25 to 65
“Jeff Green was getting open heart surgery. He was dying. He was on his last leg. They were getting his casket read—OHHH GIANNIS”
Jeff green can not guard Giannis as good as blake
Jeff green can’t guard Giannis. If you guys didn’t see that already
Somebody get Jeff Green in a sleep study. Homie looks like he needs to learn the power of naps
"Ok TBF to Giannis, I just tested the timer out on Jeff Green and he hits 8-9 seconds.   I think it just looks way worse with Giannis because he just fucking stands there staring at the rim with no rhythm."
Jeff Green has looked 45 for the past 15 years
Does Jeff Green not get good sleep or something.
"To be fair, to get those players the nets sacrificed their role players so KD has to carry Jeff green and Mike James 😭"
Not really. Joe Harris shoots it at 50% from deep and Shamet at above 40%. Both Blake and Jeff Green are good small ball 5 players. Bruce Brown is a very solid defender
"I mean, yeah. Mike James, Joe Harris, Jeff Green and KD arent competitors lol"
How the hell did Jeff Green make that in Lopez's face?
Same thing from Jeff Green sliding under Giannis when he’s taking off.
Can't step into a player.  Jeff Green wasn't set at all.
"4 flops by KD, 3 from Jeff Green, 2 from Griffin. Superteam."
Jeff Green built different
How on earth did Jeff Green know that Giannis was going to dribble right at the hoop without doing a single move???
Kyrie selling hard   Jeff green and him have as many free throw attempts (I think)  I believe and this is Green’s first time playing in the series
"*OT sorta about ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES (1992), the very first game with official NBA and NBPA licenses*:  I recently found out that I have a copy of ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES *and* a working NES (*don't ask how I just figured this out*), so I gotta talk about this game. I don't want to discuss its gameplay because you already know it sucks. Rather I'd like to talk about the details it includes for the players (*nope, not graphically, because those are pretty generic*), chiefly their abilities. Each player's profile page ([MJ's profile as an example](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/images/22)) includes their FG%, FT%, 3FG%, and then 6 abilities: Running Speed, Jumping, Stealing, Blocking, Shooting Range, and Stamina. Those shooting percentages are from the 1990-91 season, and the rosters reflect the 1991-92 season. OK, you got the basics; time to look at this game's choices with player abilities.  * First, here is [a detailed scan of the game's front and back cover](https://www.covercentury.com/covers/nes/t/nes_tecmonbabasketball.jpg). Again, this is the first game ever with licenses from both the NBA and NBPA, so it can use all the real teams and players. It can put anyone it wants on the cover -- It was early-1992, so probably Michael Jordan, or Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or David Robinson. Look closely at the main player making the play on the cover -- that's Clipper **Loy Vaugt**. The Clippers weren't good in '91, weren't supposed to be good in '92, Vaught was a rookie of no note in '91 (*5.5 ppg, #13 pick in '90 draft*) .... I can't figure out the choice that was made here.  * Speaking of the timing of this game's release - it came out with rosters set for the 1991-92 season, including mega-star **Magic Johnson** on the Lakers. Except Magic retired in November of 1991 and never played for the '92 team. Oh well.   * **RUNNING SPEED:** The game shows you a bar graph for each player's ability, but over the years people have gone into the code and pulled out the specific number that Tecmo assigned to players' ratings ([all player ratings in the game are at this link](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/faqs/50445) - *scroll way down*). Ratings are out of 100, but few speeds topped 80; somehow Jeff Ruland and Magic Johnson both had an 80 speed. Ruland is a particularly egregious selection for this fast speed since he was just coming out of 4-year retirement at that point due to massive foot troubles. The fastest players in the game, with Speeds above 80, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90), Charles Barkley (90), **3)** Tim Hardaway (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), and **5)** Orlando Woolridge (81). Barkley, huh? For that matter, MJ also has no business with the best speed in the game.  * **JUMPING:** The best jumpers/leapers in the game, with Jumping above 70, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (80), Manute Bol (80), **3)** Dennis Rodman (78), Orlando Woolridge (78), **5)** Clyde Drexler (75), David Robinson (75), Hakeem Olajuwon (75), Scottie Pippen (75), Patrick Ewing (75), **10)** Elden Campbell (74), and **11)** Otis Thorpe (72). As you can see, this category sort of stands in for ""reach"" for tall centers who get lots of blocks.  * **Best Overall Athletes** in the game based on Running Speed &amp; Jumping (RS/J) are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90/80), **2)** Orlando Woolridge (81/78), **3)** Dennis Rodman (80/78), **4)** Scottie Pippen (80/75), **5)** Shawn Kemp (80/70), David Benoit (80/70), and **7)** Larry Johnson (75/70).   * **STEALING:** The best at stealing in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** Kevin Johnson (65), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (65), Michael Jordan (65), Scottie Pippen (65), Maurice Cheeks (65), Terry Porter (65), John Stockton (65), Mark Price (65), Greg Anthony (65), Michael Adams (65), **11)** Isiah Thomas (63). I'll point out that **Gary Payton** only had a rating of 45, which is oddly low, even based on the circumstances. He had just completed his rookie season in 1990-91, and his 2.0 spg were 12th best in the league despite only playing 27 mpg (*his Steal% was 5th-best in the NBA*). He had been the Pac-10 Defensive POTY and had a ridiculous amount of steals in college (*#2 in NCAA career all-time at that point*). There was both his college reputation &amp; proof as an NBA rookie that the guy was a big-time ball theft, so I'm unsure why they kept his Stealing rating as low as they did going into his 2nd season. Weirder yet, Greg Anthony graduated in '91 right before the game was developed with nearly the same amount of college steals as Payton (329 vs 321), but had no NBA success yet since he hadn't played yet, but he got the great rating (65) and Payton didn't (45).   * **BLOCKING:** The best at blocking in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** David Robinson (90), **2)** Hakeem Olajuwon (80), **3)** Manute Bol (75), **4)** Elden Campbell (72), **5)** Rik Smits (70), John Salley (70), Chris Dudley (70), **8)** Larry Nance (65), Mark Eaton (65), **10)** Alton Lister (62)  * **Best Overall Defensive Abilities** in the game based on having 40+ in Stealing &amp; Blocking (S/B) are: **1)** John Salley (40/70), **2)** Scottie Pippen (65/40), Shawn Kemp (45/60), **4)** Larry Johnson (50/50), Chris Gatling (45/55), **6)** A.C. Green (53/43), **7)** Reggie Lewis (50/40), Billy Owens (45/45), **9)** Tim Perry (40/45), Jerome Kersey (45/40), **11)** Tyrone Hill (40/40), David Benoit (40/40)  * **SHOOTING DISTANCE:** This isn't 3-point ability, as that's measured by 3FG%, but I think this affects how consistent a player is at hitting that 3FG% ... something like that. There are a bunch of guys with a 100 in this category, mostly 3-point specialists who it makes sense to give that top score to: Dell Curry, Reggie Miller, Craig Hodges, Dale Ellis, Glen Rice, and even Larry Bird (*plus others*). But for some reason they simply decided to give a 100 shooting distance ability to Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, as well. I guess they just wanted to game their own game however they needed to to make sure the 2 biggest superstars ended up putting up superstar stats no matter what.   * **STAMINA:** If a guard played almost every game, they probably got an 80+ stamina. Players with a stamina above 80 are: **1)** Michael Adams (90), Kevin Johnson (90), Tim Hardaway (90), John Stockton (90), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (90), **6)** Spud Webb (85), Terry Porter (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), **9)** Sarunas Marciulionis (83), **10)** Gary Grant (81). This last one is an obvious error since Grant had played in only 65 and 44 games over the prior 2 seasons.  * **David Benoit:** You might have noticed that David Benoit is among the best athletes &amp; best overall defensive abilities. I'm as confused as you are -- sure he was a good athlete (*was in the '93 dunk contest*), but he was also an unheralded rookie in the 1991-92 season, meaning he never even played in the NBA before this game came out. He went undrafted in 1990, played in Spain for a year, then joined the Jazz. He was a decent-not-great player at Alabama at the same time as Robert Horry, but nothing he did there (*including his defensive stats*) leads anyone to believe the abilities given to him make any sense."
You can already see that difference Jeff Green makes.
"Jeff Green, in 4 minutes of play, has as many FTs as Kyrie has all series"
Jeff Green is a UFA after this season. We need to reup him frfr.
"Thank god we have our true MVP back, Jeff Green. Legit unexpected piece to this team that has contributed so much."
jeff green is such a reliable role player. love this guy
"With Harden healthy, I think the Nets are heavily favored against any of the remaining teams.  I think the Sixers might actually have the best shot at beating the Nets of the remaining teams because of defense and Embiid.  Matching up the best 2 way center in the league against, uh-  blake, jeff green?- is going to result in a great advantage for the sixers. On the defensive side, it'll be super interesting to see if Simmons and Thybulle can slow down Kyrie, KD, and possibly Harden.  Nets will probably try to draw Embiid away from the rim in high pick and rolls, but Embiid's gotten so smart in the Hawks series at tagging Trae on the pick and still somehow getting back to deny the lob to screener."
Lmao welcome back Jeff Green
Jeff Green absolutely got there in time
Jeff green comes in and takes a huge charge
"Nope, he’s out today, Jeff Green will be returning though"
"Didn’t know Jeff Green was playing, love that guy."
No you don't. You're gonna steamroll to the Finals with or without Jeff Green
"I know it's a joke, but Jeff Green in his role on this team is actually a pretty good addition lol"
Jeff Green is available to play (likely on a minutes limit)
"He still usually had an MVP beside him, the best spot up shooter in the entire league, and because of how often you guys go small with someone like Blake or Jeff Green at center, he's often playing with a 5 out lineup, which is a massive luxury most guys don't have."
Jeff Green was like that for a minute too
People like the idea of boxing more than the actual thing.  The Jeff Green / Robert Covington effect
"We at least need Jeff Green back if we want a chance for a deep run, dude is our 6th man..."
Jeff green will probably be back
We will adjust to the Nets and he will play up but he probably wont have to as much because jeff green and blake wont be able to do anything to him on defence and theyll have to play deandre
"Atlanta tried that this game and look how much we scored, look how much we've scored every game no defense has been able to slow us down I very highly doubt jeff green and blake are going to do better than capela. Nets will probably be forced to play deandre unless theyre going to double him off ball as well lol"
wouldnt be shocked to see the nets put jeff green/blake on him and then just double him every possession. like you mention if we play clax/deandre it just makes his life way too easy on offense. Though he will still have to guard the high pnr with durant/kyrie/harden.
"Pretty sure Embiid will be able handle deandre and claxton, and if you wanna make him guard someone with a shot like blake or jeff green he'll bully them on the other end. If its deandre and claxton then embiid will be helping on everyone"
Ugh we still gotta beat the Bucks…   This is all really depends on whether Harden or Jeff Green are back. Sixers seem like the hardest matchup but the way Utah scores can be really hard to keep up with. I love this Suns team but I think they would be the easiest matchup if they both got to the finals.
I'd say Jeff green will probably be back by then and on Harris
"LoL replace Draymond green with Danny Green to play with Klay and Curry during 2014, they are still champs. You can replace Draymond with Gerald Green or Jeff Green or any of the green brothers and the warriors still win with the splash brothers."
"However it ends, hats off to the nets. KD, JEFF GREEN, STEVE NASH. Showing how it's done."
how you gonna compliment jeff green for giannis' dumb play
The Nets didn’t even realIe they had a super team in place with KD and Jeff Green. Who needs Kyrie and Harden?
Jeff green did nothing giannes just got some butter fingers
This dude just seen a replay where Jeff green obviously had nothing to do with the turnover but he was in too deep already lol
Jeff green is the goat
Yeah let's ignore jeff Green and Blake going 10/15 from 3.
"KD and Jeff Green really won this on their own, shits crazy."
That wasn’t Jeff green it’s just Giannis being a fraud
"Lol That wasn’t Jeff green, that was all Giannis"
JEFF “ THE GOD “ GREEN
"KD has been otherworldly, but lol Budenholzer is getting fired for letting Jeff Green and Griffin combine for 44 points"
People acting like the bucks are dead this series. The nets are up 2 at home when Jeff green went 7/8 from 3 and KD has 46/16/10
Bucks really lost to Durant and Jeff Green
Durant is about to beat a 2 time mvp with a bunch of scrubs and Jeff green .
Give the ball to ~~Durant~~ Jeff Green and get out of the way
Make up your mind is it a good or bad play by Jeff green
"Attack Jeff Green, take a stupid ass fadeaway against Harden. Makes sense."
Box score warriors gonna look at the stats and say Giannis played well. He is a 2x MVP being guarded by Jeff Green and Blake Griffin. Averaging 40 pts should be a minimum.
Giannis taking free throws to tie the game. Good foul for Jeff green
Man. Still can’t get over that Jeff Green brick. Dude had the arena on the edge if their seat and put that up lol
Only KD and Jeff Green.
Jeff Green was the superstar partner KD needed to win a championship. Can't win with these other cats
"Especially from one of the greatest scorers in the NBA.  Meanwhile Jeff ""this is the 11th team I've been on"" Green is 7-7 from 3..."
I'm still mindfucked Jeff Green hit 7 3s in a row.
The bucks are shooting 50/43/84   They are playing well. FTs are deciding the game rn would be a 20 point game if Jeff Green didn’t go nuclear
This will affectionately be called the Jeff Green game in Milwaukee.
Jeff Green reminds me of Robert Horry. Silent but effective and sometimes makes the big shots.
jeff green is 7/8 from deep
jeff green 7-7 from 3. ya can't make this shit up lol
"What's weirder from this game:  a) Old Jeff Green going for a career playoff high in his second game back from injury  b) Last year's DPOY who is affectionately nicknamed ""freak"" standing in the corner guarding Joe Harris or Landry Shamet in the biggest game of the season whilst Kevin Durant lights his team up"
Jeff Green really out here looking like a 6'8 Steph
Change harden and Jeff Green and KD still has almost half of his teams points lmaooo cope
"Jeff Green picked a good time to have his monthly ""could Jeff Green be an all-star?"" game. Been doing it for 10 years!"
Jeff Green officially a playoff hero again
Jeff Green wtf
Game 5 of the 20-21 eastern semi's Jeff Green may be the best shooter of all time
Jeff green being the Nets second best player tonight   27 pts shooting 8/10 FG and 7/7 and the 3P
Blowing a 17 point lead + Jeff Green turning into a better Klay Thompson is gonna be one of the worst playoff losses in recent memory  The part where KD is carrying hard isn't as bad
Let Jeff Green shoot more! He's on fiyah
Jeff green clearly being possessed by the spirit of klay thompson
KD is going to hug Jeff Green after the game
But no highlight of Jeff Green. Change James Harden and Jeff green and nobody bats an eye
Jeff Green the star of Space Jam 3 please
I’m glad the put Giannis on Shamet. Wouldn’t want him to torch us. Much rather have Jeff Green and KD blow us the fuck up.
People were outraged over the Blake Griffin and LMA signings meanwhile Jeff Green is on a minimum and the 2nd best player in a ECF Game 5
"Durant’s godly performance aside, Jeff Green should get some well deserved accolades.  He kept the Nets in the game when they were all but resigned from it and he continues shooting lights out.  Incredible performance from him."
The one good Jeff Green game. He’s going 2-11 next game
"LOL BUCKS getting cooked by Jeff ""Steph Curry"" Green"
If I’m a Cavs fan I’d be furious watching this garbage ass Jeff Green somehow wanting to go 7 for 7 smh.
on the floor with KD and ... Jeff Green.
Jeff Green was 1/2 from 3 in this series going into tonight
Enjoy the once in a lifetime Jeff Green performance
Annual Jeff Green 30 point game. Regular as clockwork
Jeff green is 7/7 from 3. Wtf
KD - Jeff Green duo as good as LeBron Kyrie 40/40 in the finals
Just your casual 7/7 from 3 game from Jeff Green
Jeff Green has absolutely burned us today. Him and KD carried tf out of this game
"Jeff Green just decided he doesn't miss 3's anymore, damn"
Jeff Green is Fred Van Fleeting on us
Career playoff high for Jeff Green.
Jeff green clutch
If the nets win this game the big 3 better buy Jeff Green the best meal of his fucking life man
Jeff Green is so solid for a role player. Have no idea why he keeps getting minimums every year.
Bucks are getting that one of every 7 games Jeff Green games
"Just like we all expected, Jeff Green is the Bucks' kryptonite"
There are plenty of people bad on defense making much more than Jeff Green
Jeff Green memorial game
"Harden 1-10 and the Nets are up by 4, Jeff Green has 3 less points than Giannis.   jfc Bucks"
Oh we're getting that kind of Jeff Green today.
I LITERALLY CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING.  JEFF GREEN 7/7 FROM THREE
"The Nets Big 3: KD, Jeff Green, and Coach Bud"
Jeff Green NFTs so hot right now
Man what a game by Jeff Green
Jeff Green and KD cooking together. Sonics fans felt that.
"Before we jerk off KD, don't forget about Jeff Green too. He was key to keeping the Nets in it."
Let's talk about how Jeff Green might have the sexiest wife in all of the NBA....
"Jeff Green man, what a guy"
"I’m happy for Jeff Green :,)"
"If Jeff Green is shooting 7/7 from 3, you're not winning the game despite what Durant is doing"
that 3 from jeff green was a confidence killer and that turnover after? yeah it might be over
Jeff green shooting like he is on the Cavs.
Who would you rather build a team around; Giannis or Jeff Green?
"The 4th quarter Bucks offense tonight is legitimately the worst playoff offense I have *ever* seen, period, in terms of shot selection and ball movement. I’m actually laughing at some of these Bucks possessions.   When Holiday brought the ball up and Giannis stood there clapping at him for the ball, then immediately barreled into Jeff Green for a charge the second he got the ball.. that possession sums up everything. I truly believe the Bucks have no game plan in the clutch"
Jeff Green was so bad on the Cavs smh. Look at him now
im deadass serious is jeff green the greatest shooter of all time?
"Jeff green is great, Blake griffin has been playing well this series. This nets team is insane"
Jeff Green chose a great night to be the good Jeff Green.
Jeff green having the game of his life
Give Jeff green Joe Harris’s paycheck
Jeff Green is automatic
JEFF STEPH GREEN
Nets players points total/shooting %  Jeff Green 24 points - 7/9 shooting   Blake Griffin 17 points - 7/11 shooting  Landry Shamet 7 points - 3/5 shooting   Joe Harris **5 points - 2/11 shooting**  **James Harden 3 points - 1/10 shooting**   Bruce Brown 2 points - **1/5 shooting**  KD almost has half of his teams points lmaoooooo
Jeff fucking Green.
is that jeff green from the spurs?
Harden has been permanently replaced in the Big-3 by Jeff Green.
Jeff Green is unstoppable
JEFF GREEN BABY!!!
Jeff Green game
All time performance from Jeff Green
"The Celtics are shit defensively....even with harden he would not shoot 65 TS or whatever it was. Also, Jeff green who is a small ball spacing 5, was injured for those games so they had to play space eaters like Claxton more.   With kyrie in the team, he was 61TS from the field against the bucks....that’s really good vs an elite defense? Again, what the hell are you talking about?  And no, His efficiency in 3 games was lowest since 2018. He only shot 59TS from the field in the 2018 postseason."
"KD hasn’t been drawing the fouls tbh, the defense has been fine, you put Harden in his spot yesterday and if the bucks play him like that he’s shooting 20 FTs lol.   Bucks don’t have to worry about anyone their next highest scorer was Kyrie with 11 and after that Joe Harris,  Blake Griffin and Jeff Green with 8 each lol.   Also KD can’t really facilitate and get his teammates good looks. Nets’s best bet here IMO is going to be getting Blake Griffin to channel his 2018 self and play point lmao."
"I can  Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green etc"
"If there's one year KD gets a pass it's this year. The Nets are trash outside of him, Joe Harris, and maybe Jeff Green."
"Harden and Ibaka, even early in their careers, are at least as good as Wiggins and Oubre. C'mon, man. Wiggins and Oubre are both inconsistent wing scorers. OKC also had Jeff Green, if you don't recall."
"Yeah the supporting cast is absolutely horrific. Nets also lose the ability now to stagger Kryie and KD so now when KD is off the floor the Bucks will just feast. The Nets are built so top heavy, and now they're going to have to hope for big performances from Blake Griffin and Jeff Green to win lol and then also hope that Tyler Johnson and Mike James can score so yeah it's a pretty bad recipe for winning when you have minimal depth"
I don’t trust Joe and Blake to step up tbh.. they are what they the last 2 games and unless there’s a Jeff Green miracle there’s just no help for KD and them cats
Ya Joe Harris specifically needs to step up. Also Jeff Green should be a lot better as this series progresses. Last game was his first in a bit and should only improve.
"I would like another center not named Tristan Thompson. No more tiny guards from the draft. I don't care about their shooting numbers, they won't even be allowed to touch the ball in important games. Another SF/PF and some veterans. A Jeff green type that isn't Jeff green because the fourth time will not be the charm."
Griffin is washed man....he’s a 7ppg scorer. Claxton is a rookie whose 2/3 years away from being a heavy contributor. Jeff green is coming off injury. That’s rockets team is way better lol. Both flawed teams though
And it's Jeff Green who was supposed to be minutes restricted + Joe Harris who went 1/11 shooting mostly open shots WITH Kyrie+KD taking up the attention
"In what world is Joe harris, Jeff Green, and old Blake Griffin better than Middleton and Holiday?"
"I agree that the remaining games will be far more informative than was the part of Game 4 sans Kyrie.    That said, KD has Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Shamet, and probably one or two others that I'm forgetting (in addition to Mike James).  That's an infinitely better supporting offensive cast than what Curry had this season.    Wiggins TS% the year before he was traded was *sub-50*.  And he was their 2nd leading scorer this year.  You also had Stone Hands Wiseman &amp; Draymond making Ben Wallace seem like Hakeem.    We also have one good data point from Game 3 of the 2019 Finals, when Curry didn't have Klay or KD and he hung 47 on an all-time defense.    KD doesn't have to win another game, but he does need to show that he can be an unstoppable offensive force even without another superstar."
"Yeah, they were MUCH more talented with Kyrie also in the lineup. Houston never had a shooter near the caliber of Joe Harris. Jeff Green is the perfect small ball center for what the Rockets want to do, as evidenced by his play there last season. Claxton has played very much like a young Capela. Hell, even Blake Griffin is a secondary playmaker out of the front court that the Rockets haven’t had since Josh Smith.  I would at the very least compare it to the 2016-17 Rockets team, which went six against a 60-win team without anyone the caliber of Kyrie playing second fiddle for the two wins."
"Hell No !! The Nets team is pretty well constructed even without Kyrie and Harden. Joe Harris is a legit - might’ve made the all-star team in another universe. Blake Griffin is playing like it’s 2017. Mike James, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, all solid players. This Nets team is atleast better than a few of the James Cavaliers that ran through the East Post Kyrie."
PG Kevin durant  SG joe Harris  SG Landry Shamet  SG TLC C Jeff green  Second rotation PG Tyler Johnson SG TLC SG Kevin durant  SF Blake griffin C deandre Jordan
Difference is they don't need Jeff Green next season
"2011 Celtics would just be way too dominant.   Peak playmaking Rondo?  Elite shot creator and top 3 shooter of all time Ray Allen?  Elite two way scoring machine Paul Pierce?  Top 3 and most versatile PF ever Kevin Garnett?  Most dominant player ever Shaq?  With Jermaine O’Neal, Nate Robinson, and Delonte West, Jeff Green, and Bradley coming off the bench?  Hard to see anyone beating that. Only one that has any chance really is the 2004 Lakers and 2019 Warriors."
Jeff Green is unstoppable today lmao he can’t miss
7/7 from 3 what the fuck Jeff Green
Jeff green is my new favorite player
Lmao jeff green playing like he trying to make the hall of fame
The Jeff Green game
JEFF GREEN
Jeff Green!
JEFF GREEN YOU SEXY BROTHA
So does Jeff Green like really want to win a championship or something? Dude's 34-years-old and playing like he's 25.
"Yeah u might be right. You gotta give the nets a lot of credit though, amazing performances form KD and Jeff green. And a heroic effort from harden"
"Just put giannis on the post, nets center is jeff green rn"
Wow Jeff Green carrying the Nets bench
KD and Jeff Green. Name a more iconic duo. I’ll wait
so fuck jeff green
Jeff green and brake got like 80 points
Is this the best game KD has ever played given the circumstances and how everyone else is playing except for Jeff Green?
KD been balling big Jeff Green deserves a ton of credit… He’s thread got them back in the game and gave them confidence…
"Yea. I'm new because the nets who should have no chance are somehow up with a hobbled passive harden, missing Harris, with Jeff green add the leading scorer and we're down 20 early on. Yes. I'm new cuz them being up is unexpected"
Jeff Green gave him the chance
Jeff Green is matching Khris Middleton's output on way better efficiency.
Jeff Green has the most random great games
"Durant, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin have stepped up so much while Harden and Irving have been banged up. Props to these guys, meeting the moment when it matters."
"Giannis draws way more contact than KD but has a fraction of his free throws, refs also neutered him in the 1st Q with a quick 2 fouls.  Somehow Jeff Green magically playing flawless defense without fouling, man GTFO"
Yes but for some reason they ain’t double teaming Durant when he’s killing them and everyone is playing like shit except Jeff Green. Idk what Bud doing
Bucks really gonna lose to Jeff Green LOL
"Good at basketball when the refs are giving him every call he wants, James harden is playing well &amp; Jeff green is dropping 20****. Fraud"
Jeff Green can't keep getting away with this
Giannis was really calling for that ball only to run over Jeff green
"As a Georgetown fan, seeing Jeff Green succeed makes me happy"
Bucks just don't know how to win. Giannis is 8 feet tall and pump-faking Jeff Green in the paint.  Most fragile team I've ever seen.
"It worked at the start of the game, they couldn’t get anything at the rim for most of the game. Walling off the rim was working very well. But now KD has just tore them apart. Not expecting Jeff green to become steph either."
Jeff Green is a god
JEFF GREEN GOAT
Jeff green just stood in the lane that possession
1st team all defense and he’s on Jeff Green right now. Step up Giannis.
“Single handedly” like Jeff green didn’t have 45 at the half.
Jeff Green really taking control of this game. There's a reason he's a superstar
Wtf am I watching are the bucks really about to choke to a KD and Jeff green duo bro
KD and Jeff Green really tryna make this happen playing 4 on 5. KD is the best in the world rn
"Jeff Green is low key the MVP of this game with 24 pts. We all knew Durant needed 40 to have a shot. But with Green putting up potential 30, that’s the clincher"
Jeff Green
"KD CARRYING the fuck outta the Nets + Jeff Green. Everyone else been two packs of ass, especially Joe Harris."
Jeff Green is in this game
Jeff Green also exists
How do you have Jeff Green hit 6 threes and still be down lol
Jeff Green got Bud fired tonight.
Win or lose proud of the effort. Jeff Green came to play.
Didn't expect this to be the Jeff Green game
Harden and Harris better get on their knees to praise Jeff Green after this game
How come Jeff Green not able to get more than a minimum contract
Because Jeff Green is 6-6 and Joe is 0-7?
"We could be playing better but Durant is Durant and Jeff Green is fucking 6/6 from 3, also doesn't help the refs are so blatantly helping out the Nets"
Jeff green really the mvp and kd goin hard too
"Jeff Green good, Bucks bad"
"Joe Harris and Jeff Green are a combined 6-13 from three. The Nets will take that any day, so I don't see why everyone is so down on Joe."
Jeff Green erasure
Budenholzer is a fucking idiot. You call the timeout after the Jeff Green 3. Give Portis some minutes. Lopez isn’t doing much to stop Durant and others at the rim. Doesn’t help that Giannis looked complacent on defense.
They better be thanking the lord for Jeff Green
"I just want to say: Fuck Jeff Green. Fuck player like him.  Against the Raptors in 2019, it was Fred VanVleet who couldn't miss  Against the Heat last year, it was Goran Dragic who couldn't miss  Against the Nets, it is Jeff Green  Why, why, why do one random shooter have a career series against us? Oh, I know why! Because of Bud's scheme. Still, most shooters at least miss some of their open shots. These shooters are literally hitting everything."
Jeff Green has 24 points on 9 FGA stop it and Blake has 17 on 11 FGA. He couldn't have more help from the role players. He has been great tho
I mean Jeff Green literally cannot miss a shot so
"Jeff Green, Mike Budenholzer, Foul Trouble"
Joe Harris is broke as fuck tonight. KD playing with Jeff green as his second option and nets would be up rn if Harris could shoot lmao
KD played well in the first half but he took it to another level in the 3rd after Jeff green lit that spark. He’s about to have a crazy triple double if nets keep draining 3s
Jeff Green about to win this for the Nets.
Jeff green is 6-6 from 3 with 24 points…
Jeff Green for Harris surely Nash
"Classic game so far for the nets big three: KD, Blake Griffin and Jeff Green"
"already clenching for the ""is jeff green the most underrated signing"" posts"
I feel like Jeff Green wanted to be an artist but he became 6’8 and talented
"Imagine Jeff Green, P.J. Tucker, and Harden on the same team"
Pls put Jeff “ steph curry” green back in
I just woke up how the fuck is Jeff green 6-6 from deep
You mean Jeff Green
you mean Jeff Green deserves credit for willing this victory. Jeff Green carrying da snake LOL
Bit rude to Jeff Green tbh
"Jeff Green the real MVP, man is all heart."
"jeff green such a good story, man had heart surgery and still made a comeback afterwards"
Jeff green sitting. The Bucks got a chance
Damn. Jeff Green and KD have the same barber
Jeff green has a bald spot
Stop it. Only reason the game is close is because of Jeff Green.
"Its the NBA guys lol don't be surprised to see Nets get back in this game, officiating will always fluctuate the game. It's not just that though Bucks doing poorly on the offensive end right now and Jeff Green having the game of his life."
"Like chuck said, harden is just a decoy. Real star is Jeff Green"
"Ikr! In a team with Durant, Joe Harris, and Harden, Jeff Green is definitely the expected leading scorer"
Not points bc Jeff Green but yes to everything else
im tattooing a potrait of jeff green on my ass
refs making jeff green hit 3s
jeff green &gt; 3 mvp winners
"I understand completely but:  Jrue Holiday, Middleton and Giannis should be enough to overcome Jeff freaking Green having a good game."
Well when you have players not missing it’s going to happen. I’d like to see the last time Jeff Green was 100% with 6 attempts. His season high this year was 5 3PM on 12 attempts.
"Blake, KD, Jeff Green"
"If I had a nickel for every time Jeff Green was the second option on a contender, I'd have two nickels - which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice."
Jeff Green leads with points because he hasn’t missed a three
Jeff Green 6-6 from three wtf
"Jeff Green, a legit superstar playing with scrubs. Hate to see it."
Blow up the team and build around Jeff Green
34 year old Jeff Green saving Durants legacy 🧁
Jeff Green
"Ah yes, the Brooklyn Nets Big 3  Jeff Green, Kevin Durant, and ~~Blake Griffin~~ Jeff Green"
"Box and one is more about having few shooters than few playmakers.  The Nets still have shooters in Harris, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Mike James, even Jeff Green was hot from behind the arc this year.  I don't expect it."
"Yes because KD, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green and Joe Harris are irrelevant NBA players"
"I dont know how its possible for him to win without Kyrie and Harden, surely people arent expecting him to win? Harris is a 15ppg scorer and underperforms in playoffs, and will probably especially struggle without harden. Blake is averaging less than 10 ppg. Jeff green might be able to get him 15. The only person who would have a chance of carrying this team is prime Bron. and not to mention Lma retired and spencer is injured."
"Without Harden or Kyrie, I just can’t see KD carrying with Joe Harris and Jeff Green. Bucks have the depth and the shooting and can center in and make KD’s life hell now. I might go Bucks in 6"
Jeff Green leading the Nets in scoring. As we all predicted
Jeff Green hasnt missed a 3 DAMN
*Jeff Green is by himself tho
jeff green might be able to win with these cats
Bucks getting fuckeed by Jeff green and Griffin
Jeff Green can't miss which has finally inspired the other Nets shooters to stop missing
"Jeff Green carrying the team, that 4th foul they just called was baloney though.  Refs are the only thing that can stop this man tonight!"
34 year old Jeff Green saving Durants legacy 🧁
JEFF  FUCKING  GREEN  GAME
You mean Jeff Green?
Jeff Green + KD = BIG TWO
Jeff Green is fucking out of his mind  hes unlocked the 4th eye what the fuck is happening
KD getting carried hard by the refs and…. jeff green. Big yikes
"I'd be mad if I hadn't seen Jeff Green do this before, and the Bucks do this before as well."
Jeff Green the G
Lebron punching the air right now watching Jeff Green ball out after he played with Greens corpse in Cleveland.
"It’s not even the offense this time, it’s our perimeter defense and Jeff green going 6/6 from three lol"
Monthly Jeff Green game.. good timing
If the bucks lose to Jeff green they need to fire bud out of a cannon before game 6 as pre game entertainment
"Jeff Green saving KD's legacy, this is fantastic narrative"
If Brooklyn wins they got to build a statue of Jeff Green outside of the arena
Jeff Green is my new favorite player

Jeff Green with the annual random game where go goes off
"Durant has been finding the open man the whole game,and finally someone except Jeff Green is hitting their shots"
A loss might end the Bucks franchise not sure you recover from losing because Jeff Green turns into Klay Thompson
Get the Jeff Green statue ready!
I knew they should've called a timeout after the Jeff Green 3. The Nets were feeling good. Bud is so stupid I swear if we lose this game he should not be the coach in game 6
"i dare someone to say shit about KD...man is doing everything he can on the floor...kudos to Jeff Green, a straight legend and a bucket, always hated the fact that okc traded him"

Jeff Green playing very well but jesus are the refs really fucking the bucks this hard or am I seeing things wrong?

Jeff Green playing like James Harden wtf
"The Nets are so unfair. I mean who can compete with a big 3 of Jeff Green, Joe ‘Bricklayer’ Harris, and ~~James Harden~~ Rick Ross"
Jeff Green just gets younger as time goes on.
"If there was any time for a Jeff Green game, it is today."

"Leading scorer Jeff Green, just like everyone thought"
jeff green saving the snakes already mediocre legacy LOL
"KD has no balls and Harden looks like his mind and body are on opposite ends. Joe Harris has been fucking trash, and Jeff Green is reason they are barely alive."
Jeff Green needs to breastfeed Harden before next game

i actually like jeff green but you got a problem if he’s your second best player.
Respect Jeff Green plz
And if you remove Jeff Green that goes down to 4-24. Wow.  Edit: numbers
jeff green is the second best player……
This game would be over if it weren’t for Jeff Green.
Jeff Green can’t win with these cats
KD with 18/9/3/2/2 at half and it doesn't even matter because nobody besides him and Jeff Green are playing well. Pain.
"KD is actually playing out of his mind, but Harden is clearly not ready and everyone but Jeff Green has been dogshit."
you ruined the punchline by not putting jeff green somewhere in there
"Bron went to the finals with Jeff Green, Jr Smith, washed K Love and George Hill as the starting 5. I'm taking Joe Harris and Blake over those guys easy.  Where are the nephews that told me KD was better than Bron at now?"
Jeff Green can't win with these cats
Jeff Green needs more help

Jeff Green out there getting Harden like favoritism from the refs. Must be nice.
This is one of those games where Jeff Green looks like a top 10 talent in the league I see. That means next game he will be D league material.
Jeff Green is outscoring Durant? #NotMyNumber1
Jeff green looks vaguely like sal Khan from Khan academy
"Jeff Green literally just drove and fell down, and that's considered a foul on Lopez? The home court whistle indeed..."

Ah Mike James-Jeff Green two man game. The best Nets gameplan.
Jeff Green can’t win with these cats
imagine if jeff green was surrounded by real talent
"That was def a foul on Giannis, but also an obvious flop from Jeff Green lol"
Jeff Green one of the few guys you love on this Nets team
I was totally expecting Grant Hill to say that Jeff Green is a utilitarian.
Jeff Green has spent this entire series getting barreled by Giannis lol
"Hey, just leave Jeff Green wide open. Brilliant."
"I’m not saying Jeff Green isn’t important to the Nets, but they’ve got a bench full of guys who are willing to spend the majority of their minutes trying to draw charges lmao"
His being on the Nets makes it harder but ya gotta root for Jeff Green. What a guy

Jeff Green has been so good these last 3-5 years. Surprises the shit out of me nobody has paid him
Jeff Green is still kinda bouncy for a 34 year old.
Jeff Green woke up this morning and chose violence
Jeff green is determined to dunk on someone this game lol
Jeff Green trying to dunk on everyone
Jeff Green doesn’t have the ups that he used to :(  Would have loved to see 2013 Jeff finish that slam over Brook
Who does Jeff Green think he is?
lmao yo Jeff Green gotta chill
Jeff Green REALLY wants to dunk lmao
Who's more important to their team? Jeff green or divencenzo?
"Rip Jeff Green, he lived a good life."
jeff green always had a lot of talent but he's just super lazy and now he just kinda bounces around the league sitting on the bench
I would say its likely he plays game 5. They did the same thing with Jeff Green if im not mistaken
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"All season the Nets have said stuff along the lines of “yeah he’s progressing, I don’t know when they’ll be back” then boom they’re on the floor next game.  Harden could be ready to go tonight, or ready to go in game 6 and they’d say the same thing. Jeff Green being a prime example of that.  It’s ok to play hurt, but never play injured and I hope harden doesn’t jeopardize he Is health by trying to play injured.  Hopefully though he can go"
