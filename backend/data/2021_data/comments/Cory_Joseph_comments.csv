Honestly I was trying to hide my identity but I realized that I'm being over paranoid. It's Cory Joseph.
cory joseph? I don't know about highly relilable but he won a chip with spurs. North and east of Bradley birth is Canada.
Cory Joseph?
"Our bigs blow, Buddy has zero IQ, and we give serious minutes to Cory Joseph and Hassan Whiteside.  But we have Fox so that’s coo"
"Vucevic for Cory Joseph, Marvin Bagley, and a 1st?"
"I mean instead of getting a Cory Joseph at 29 two years in a row. I would love to miss out on two 29th picks straight and then 3rd year finding Dejounte Murray or Derrick White at 29.  What I mean is if you find a Murray/White every third year, that's great, but there's not much great about finding Cory Joseph. It doesn't elevate your team at all."
Holy shit Cory Joseph is on Sacramento
Cory Joseph too when he first couldn’t crack the Spurs lineup according to the Raptors broadcast last night
I don't think Cory Joseph is much of a success story. He's subpar at best. He probably has a great work ethic and that's why he got a place in the league but he definitely can not be any team's starter.
"The 2011 draft was great. The nephew, Cory Joseph, and Davis Bertans."
"Yea and Tony, Barbosa, and Tiago Splitter at 28...  Even Cory Joseph was a borderline starter (29th pick)...it's pretty incredible haha"
Holmes and Cory Joseph too
"Cory Joseph has played 284 consecutive nba games, the longest active streak rn"
"+/- is not a good stat for measuring individual performance.  That said, here are the minus leaders:  1. D'Angelo Russell    /  -165 2. Cory Joseph         /  -117 3. Glenn Robinson III  /  -113 4. Darius Bazley       /  -111 5. Ricky Rubio         /  -102"
"Fox,Heild,Lebron,Barnes,Holmes Bench: Haliburton, Bagley, Bjelica, Cory Joseph, Hassan Whiteside, Glen Robinson 3. Yea I would put them as a contender."
"Y'all want whiteside for idk KD, I guess? Can throw in cory joseph to sweeten the pot if needed.. hmu on tumblr if u down"
Yeah Haliburton and Holmes probably the two best defenders which is part of the problem but Haliburton has a good future. Dont think Cory Joseph has looked as good defensively this year. This teams transition defense though the stats are really ugly.
"Brandon Clarke is a great help defender, Chris Boucher is a great shot blocker, Cory Joseph is a great perimeter defender, Thompson gives effort, I think defense is actually their strength"
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
Cory Joseph was -20 in 7 minutes. I can't remember the last time someone had this rough a game despite playing so little
Cory Joseph was -20 in 7 minutes.
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
Someone wants Cory Joseph? Where do I sign?
"even if its not of that high tier, even someone like cory joseph or dj augustin seems like they could be really good for a young team"
"He has a very similar guarding profile to Dame - ideally the weakest perimeter player on the other team. But more flexible to taller players if that's the least dangerous matchup. I had a look at their top-15 respective matchups (based on [NBA tracking data](https://go.nba.com/bo3c)) by minutes played last season.  I can give you a more detailed breakdown if you want one, but to avoid an even longer wall of text, here's a summary (these are sums over the top-15 defensive assignments for each, positions from wikipedia):  * Luka spent 34:29 on PGs, 40:55 on PG/SG, 11:53 on SGs, 27:43 on SG/SF, and 52:36 on forwards who aren't even part-time guards. That is far more time on only-guards at 86:17 minutes compared to 52:36 on only-forwards, or about 64% more time on only-guards than only-forwards. * Dame spent 55:38 on PGs, 43:33 on PG/SG, 31:46 on SGs, 10:56 on SG/SF, and 36:21 across three different forwards who aren't even part-time guards. More time on players who are never-PGs than only-PGs. * Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both top-15 lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. * Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens. The only difference is that one is taller so the coach maybe has more flexibility in picking the more suitable guy to guard.  Also, this ""you are what you guard"" concept is a mess of a circular argument. But even if that is applied, Luka is certainly more of a guard than a forward. And since he's a guard, he's also clearly playing at on-ball/point rather than off-ball/shooting guard."
Yeah hit Fred for he triple in the left corner. Funny he did the exact same thing to win a game a few years before with Cory Joseph vs the Wiz
"I just watched SAC let Cory Joseph run the offense for 9 mins, 6 of which Haliburton was stuck in the corner for. I don’t know if they are tanking or have just given up on this one."
Tony Parker was 28th. George Hill was like 26hth. Cory Joseph was 29th (miss that guy). Tiago was 28th.   Barbosa was 28th. Although i forget if we just picked for another team or we traded him after we picked him
Don't let this game distract you from the fact that Cory Joseph has played 275 straight games. The new iron man.
Bruh. Cory Joseph is lighting us up?
"I think Haliburton is our 6th man for this year. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to have him come off the bench and run our second unit instead of Cory Joseph. But I have also seen every 2 and 3 man iteration of Fox, Buddy, Haliburton, and Joseph this year in just 8 games. Generally, Fox, Buddy, and Hali have been closing out games, and I like the rotations with Hali coming off the bench.  I think it is too early to know what next year guard rotation looks like. I would like to see all 3 back."
"20 years ago. 2000 games i believe. We are a trash team where only a few NBA players play, except Cory Joseph. The rest are scrubs. How is countries like Croatia, DR, czechia ranked higher. No offense to them but come on."
Cory Joseph had the team high +/-
Neither. Several players had a +2 and Cory Joseph had a -30.
&gt; Team low -27  Cory Joseph: Am I a joke to you?  Everyone: Yes
Cory Joseph is on the Kings?
Cory Joseph bad
Cory Joseph is trash. How does he make the money he does to play this bad?
"Ayyy Cory Joseph, forgot he existed"
"I'm not sure if you've watched a kings game this season but that is not who Bagley is lol. He is definitely not switchable, so you're giving him way too much credit there. He's not doing much in terms of offensive rebounds either. He has made serious strides in his bbiq though and does play within himself most of the time. He has trouble in a specific lineup that gets played off the court every third quarter (Cory Joseph, Buddy Heild, Bjelica, Barnes/Robinson, Basgley). There simply isn't enough interior defense there and no one can get there own shot reliably, other than Bagley. This results in some isos for Bagley and a drop in his efficiency. When he plays with Fox or Haliburton he's solid.   He had one bad game vs Houston. We don't need a referendum of the guys future. We get it he won't be Luka you guys can go back to treating him like any other #2 pick."

Cory Joseph revenge game
"Kings were acc pathetic. I don’t understand how they were so bad. Their game plan was just “let’s shoot the ball from anywhere at anytime, especially if we’re contested.” Youre playing a team of literally rookies, with our best player being Cory Joseph, why tf are you crumbling like this   Free Delon Wright smh"
Kangz fucked up by trading Cory Joseph
"Kill me...  I just want to watch my team lose with young guns learning, scoring, making mistakes...  But no, all i got is Cory Joseph show, single handling stoping our choking.  Fuck man, let me lose, Fuck Blake Griffin too"
YALL LET CORY MOTHERFUCKING JOSEPH DROP 24/4/7 LMFAOOOOOO WHAT?!?!  THIS IS WORSE THAN THE BAGLEY PICK
Cory Joseph  I know we’re tanking but he very much did cost us a win. That and he’s taking a lot of minutes when we got Saben Lee who’s just earned more minutes with how well he’s played
Oh well that's because.. Um.. Pistons are contenders and recently traded for MVP candidate Cory Joseph and.. Okay lol I have no explanation for that one.
Cory Joseph and Saben Lee
Also we just traded solid Delon Wright for trash Cory Joseph. Isn’t that also a clear tanking move?
"Dude we’re playing 4 rookies, a ten-day contract, a 32 year old, 2 second year guys, and Cory freaking Joseph. We have ONE very good player right now. We also traded away two former MVPs and another All-star, didn’t re-sign Christian Wood, and traded Luke Kennard and Bruce brown. How are we trying to make the playoffs? 😂"
"Cory Joseph is definitely the goat. MVP, dpoy, rookie of the year."
“The best ability is availability”  So you agree that Cory Joseph is one of the greatest players of this generation?  And that Dwight Howard has had a better season than Lebron James?
Cory Joseph had 10 out of those 15 points lol
"&gt;I actually looked at PGs per/year salaries and at $12m/yr he would be in the range of Clarkson, Pat Bev, Patty Mills, Cory Joseph, Marcus Smart, Dinwiddie, and Exum. I would see him settling in this range well. Smart/Clarkson would probably be the only guys I would take over him in this range, all things considered.  Just posted, but peep this list to see where you think he would slide in [https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/point-guard/](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/point-guard/)"
"Oh I think his value to the team is immense, but the Mavs would be stupid not to listen to offers it they can get a legit two-way starter out of him.  Just looking at him as an asset, he is already 24. Will be 25 at the start of the season. His game isn't reliant on athleticism, so I could see his game maturing well into his 30s. You have to also take into account the Carlisle bump that a guard takes in his system- whether you believe it or not, it has proven to be true 80% of the time.  I actually looked at PGs per/year salaries and at $12m/yr he would be in the range of Clarkson, Pat Bev, Patty Mills, Cory Joseph, Marcus Smart, Dinwiddie, and Exum. I would see him settling in this range well. Smart/Clarkson would probably be the only guys I would take over him in this range, all things considered."

"Lol @ no Cory Joseph, try watching the games"
Who overrated Cory Joseph. There hasn't been anything other than trash talk for Corys play in Kings subreddit. Not only defence but offence as well. Worst value/money player in the whole league IMO. 12mil for him is robbery he is menace
And 2-0 since trading Cory Joseph :)
The way the commentators respect and talk about Cory Joseph. As if he hasn't been a tank commander the last few seasons.
"Please you really think Like ""23 minutes a night of Cory Joseph"" Walton is smart enough to do that on purpose?"
"Agree with those areas, I have to shout out Toronto area too: Wiggins, SGA, Cory Joseph, Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray, NAW, RJ Barrett, + more who made it (Tyler Ennis, Thon Maker, Anthony Bennett, Nik Stauskas, + more)  And future's looking good too, specifically a kid named Elijah Fisher"
Shoutout to Cory Joseph coming in to steady the tank when it looked like we might run away with the lead
"Uhhh...I mean who even has more trade value between those two? Buddy on his contract or Bagley, I’m assuming Buddy probably?  Kind of like the Knicks for Hield but I’m not sure how the salaries can match. Knicks would have to send 5 players but maybe Obi Toppin Ntilkina and 3 expiring for those 2? Ntilikina gives the kings a backup defensive PG also basically what Cory Joseph was supposed to be  Gauging Bagley’s trade value in general is hard. Didn’t know whether to include Knox or not also"
Fox is really trying hard to stop the tank  But nothing can stop tank commanders Fluke Walton and Cory Joseph
Cory fucking Joseph.  Inject that fuck right out of Sacramento
"I could have Cory Joseph at pg, dont need Curry. Taking Harden for his playmaking and assists. Much needed on this squad"
"Found 5  * Terrel Harris (2010 Rio Grande Valley Vipers, 2012 Heat) * Cory Joseph (2012 Austin Toros, 2014 Spurs) * James Michael McAdoo (2015 Santa Cruz Warriors, 2015 &amp; 2017 Warriors) * Pascal Siakam (2017 Raptors 905, 2019 Raptors) * Fred VanVleet (2017 Raptors 905, 2019 Raptors)"
"&gt; How many times have Lakers fans tried to include Kuzma in trades? Why sign Blake Griffin when Nick Claxton is a good young player you need to discover how to fit in the system?   Because Claxton is a project that might require years to develop and the Nets want to win now?  Because Kuzma has probably reached his potential as a player and Lakers also want to continue winning?  If we could flip young Kyle Anderson and Cory Joseph back in 2014-15 say for 34 years old Pau Gasol, I'd be fucking ecstatic."
"&gt;where both Cory Joseph and Wayne Ellington played over 30 minutes  Like I said, tanking"
"We had a win against the Grizzlies last week where both Cory Joseph and Wayne Ellington played over 30 minutes. Dont lump us in with the Thunder, who aren't even trying to hide it."
"No there are a few international players as well that don't fit the NBA mold but for some reason do phenomenal on the world stage. Case #1 Pick Anthony Bennett, didn't do well in the NBA but plays well on FIBA stage. Phillip Scrubb and his brother are good.  But this year:  PG // SG // SF // PF // C  Murray // Shai // RJ // Boucher // Olynyk  Brooks // Wiggins // Dort // Clarke // Tristan Thompson   Cory Joseph // Trey Lyles // Alexander-Walker // Dwight Powell // Anthony Bennett   I mean this is a grezzy team. US is a monster will take years to compete with, but sold lock for top 4 in the world with this roster. Even 2nd is possible."

You’d think we were the playoff team &amp; they were the tanking team watching this game."

I'm just listing down 3 to tie but game winners against Washington   Cory Joseph  Hedo turkuglu  Serge ibaka  Chris Bosh  Gary trent jr

My top 5:  1. Elfrid Payton  2. Frank Ntilikina  3. Tacko Fall  4. Cory Joseph  5. Lebron James
Pistons and Cory Joseph for some reason.
"Makes sense. Luka hasn’t missed a game in a while and this is an ideal game to rest him  Pistons with no Grant, Plumlee, or notable Mavs killer Cory Joseph"
"I’d argue the 2013 &amp; 2014 Spurs and 2011 Mavs are closer to the most complete teams in recent NBA history.   Spurs had Parker, Ginobili, Green, Kawhi, Duncan, Diaw, Splitter, Patty and Cory Joseph. They had a lineup for every style and could defend against any team or lineup they came across.   The Mavs had Dirk, Kidd, Chandler, Terry, Peja, Stevenson, Marion, JJ, Brewer and Haywood. The only defensive weakness was Dirk but he was a superstar that year to the level that no one on the Spurs team I mentioned nor anyone on the Jazz are close. Other than that they could defend any superstar you threw at them with multiple defenders and they had 4 or 5 guys who could reliably create offense.   The Jazz’s weakness is that they can’t match any of the other contenders through sheer talent/star power. In the playoffs you eventually have to be able to match a KD, LeBron, Jokic, Kawhi, Steph level player down the stretch of 16 games. They also have no real hope of guarding a LeBron, KD, Harden, Kawhi, or Luka. Royce Oneal and Joe Ingles are not carrying you through 4 rounds against that competition."
Imagine getting crossed by Cory Joseph
It’s official. I’m taking Cory Joseph over Michael Jordan
"One trade I didn’t understand was the Cory Joseph+2 seconds to Detroit for Delon Wright. Why did the Kings give up 2 picks for Wright? He’s on the exact same level CoJo is, both mediocre backup point guards.   I don’t understand the Kings man, they should’ve sold high on Barnes, moved Hield, and not given up draft capital for a guy like Wright."
It's now saying first bucket was a 3 pointer from Cory Joseph followed by a 3 from Brogdon. What the hell ESPN?
"IM DEAD SERIOUS. LUKE WALTON IS ALSO KNOWN FOR HIS GREATEST HITS LIKE SITTING DOWN FOR 75% OF THE GAME, PLAYING CORY JOSEPH 35 MINUTES A NIGHT, AND REFUSING TO PLAY ANY OF OUR YOUNG PLAYERS MORE THAN 3 MINUTES EVEN IN A BLOWOUT"
Cory Joseph lol
"Got tired of teams like the Thunder and Rockets blatant tanks, so we gave Cory Joseph 36 minutes tonight."
It just hilarious how much Cory Joseph plays for this team these days.  We have a million guards and he's out there soaking up 30 minutes a night.  Great for the tank.
It's because Harkless is Luke's new favorite. Just like how Cory Joseph was Luke's last new favorite.
"I hate how this is so fucking true. He played CORY FUCKING JOSEPH 23 FUCKING MINUTES a night. Who was bottom 10 of all players who played more than 10 minutes a game.   He's now in love with Harkless, who isn't bad, but he's put him in the starting lineup over Haliburton.   I'm not even sure what Luke is actually good at as a coach."
Is CoJo Cory Joseph? It took me awhile to even come up with a guess for that one.
Kelly and Cory Joseph deserves mention too!
"but there's still dort, shai, boucher, olynk, khem birch, cory joseph  if memphis gets knocked out in the play-in, there's brooks and brandon clarke as well.  if goldenstate gets knocked out or loses first round wiggins is potentially available too."
Pistons got Cory Joseph too lol. Casey literally tryna recreate the 2015-16 Raps
Chris Boucher  Khem Birch  Oshae Brissett  Anthony Bennett  Cory Joseph  Jamal Magloire
"I do think Pop and the front office have a lot of influence on the Austin Spurs.   They run a very similar system, which is why so many Spurs players have grown up through though the GLeague and had successful careers (Ian Mahinmi, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Drew Eubanks, etc.)  Not at all trying to take anything away from Snyder. He is a great coach and has shown it this year. He paved his own path, and deserves all the respect."
"From what I understand their rankings are based on actual results in tournaments and things of that nature. So even though on paper Canada should have one of the top teams due to all the NBA talent they have, the results don’t lineup because their top guys don’t really show up. Like for the 2019 World Cup, Cory Joseph &amp; Khem Birch were the only NBA guys that participated."
"I know I’m forgetting guys from further back, but off the top of my head Bryn Forbes, Bertans, Danny Green, and Cory Joseph come to mind. Jonathan Simmons was a really cool story. I know Spurs were the first to bring Boban to the league from Europe. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray don’t fit the criteria but as far as development goes they seem to be on a good trajectory so far. And in addition to Manu I do think TP and Kawhi are major scouting and development success stories.  I think the main thing is that they haven’t had a lottery pick in a long time, but stayed dominant by scouting and forming high-caliber role players and even stars. I’m not sure that Manu, TP, and Kawhi get to be among the very best players in the league if not for playing with the Spurs."

"Every role players ""graduated"" from Spurs are somehow able to perform with great basketball IQ, play ball the right way, are reliable and able to stick in the league for quite a while.  Garrett Temple  Gary Neal  Kyle Anderson  Cory Joseph  Danny Green"
He slapped Cory Joseph too &amp; did something to DeMar.
He tried to do something to DeRozan too &amp; slapped Cory Joseph.
Canada went from having a legit back court of Murray/SGA to now having to possibly start Cory Joseph
Just read an NHL article and was actually a bit stunned to read that McDavid is the highest paid player at $12.5M - less than NBA guys like Cory Joseph and Trevor Ariza.
"If everyone was healthy and wants to play we would have:   SGA, Murray, Wiggins, Dort, Boucher, Brooks, Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Khem Birch, Oshae Brissett, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, NAW from the Pels, Cory Joseph"
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
"He wasn't good with Detroit? How about Detroit wasn't good with him? Especially with the way the coach told him he has just as good as a shot there then New York. With that attitude no wonder the pistons are doing horrible. Coach needs to pick that team up. Easily was the best PG dare I say player for Detroit in his short time there especially when you look at the PG depth for Detroit and they just have Killian Hayes, Cory Joseph, saben lee and Frank jackson  . Rose has been putting up numbers all besides the Cavs season. But I will agree he's been playing phenomenal with the Knicks. But I'll end this on a note that if you haven't been following rose since the bulls traded him to New York originally then you've been vastly missing out on the Renaissance of a man coming back to form when all seemed to give up on him."
"Spurs had TP Manu Danny Green Kawhi Marco belinelli patty mills and Cory Joseph, they were really deep. Tony Parker was absolutely an elite scorer, Manu was still explosive, Kawhi made big shots and Danny green couldn’t miss, pretty disrespectful statement to that team. Also imo jrue and Kris are capable of avg 25+ easily considering higher volume and mins in the playoffs."
"I don’t think you understand the difference in skill set lol. Again, we’re not comparing an average NBA player to a Euroleague all star or anything. Wiggins was the best player in the nation. Pro ball is impressive, but there are still massive skill differences.   I knew Cory Joseph growing up, and his older brother ended up playing overseas. I’ve seen those two players go against each other in high school, and it wasn’t close. Cory Joseph is an average backup point guard, Wiggins was, again, the nation’s best player. That just makes the comparison even more absurd."
He's prob talking about Cory Joseph.  Can't argue with him on that one.
Josh Jackson/Cory Joseph
"&gt;If the Lakers genuinely believed he was a decent role player on a decent contract, then why in the world would they be looking to trade him?  To improve the team?   It's not like Kuzma is expected to be star or anything like that with that salary. Let's look at the other players in the same range. Justise Winslow 13M, Kennard 12.7M, Cory Joseph 12.6M, Terence Ross 12.5M. Even if you think that Kyle Kuzma isn't as good as some of these players, he's not far off.   Plus, it's a 2+1 deal. So, an expiring contract after 1 season. it wouldn't be dead weight on your cap space either."
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
"Bro I mean a roster of Jamal, SGA, Wiggins, Barrett, Dort, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Olynyk, Dwight Powell, Chris Boucher and Cory Joseph is pretty ridiculously good, they have a lot of exciting younger guys too...Alexander-Walker comes to mind. A fully healthy Canadian B-ball Olympic team has gotta be the second best team in the world by a long shot, right?"
"&gt; less talented players like Fred have flourished because they found a good spot for themselves  When Fred first signed with the Raps he was the 4th PG in the rotation behind Lowry, Cory Joseph, and Delon Wright. Then there was also DeMar, Norm, and T-Ross who had guard minutes ahead of him. He earned his way into this spot, not because he found a good spot"
"Tbh FVV was a pretty bad roster fit for us coming into the league, we had a ton of guard depth that he was buried behind.  It's a testament to his hard work that he eventually beat out more ""talented"" guards like Delon Wright, Cory Joseph, Norman Powell, etc."
"Sexton, 3, and the right to swap in 2022 for Cory Joseph and 1, who says no"
"2014 spurs in shambles lmao, would lose tony, manu, patty, marco, tiago, diaw, baynes, cory joseph  would be left with like Duncan, Kawhi, Green"
Andrew Wiggins was their best player. It's not like they're that great of a team. RJ Barrett was his sidekick and choked in the 2nd half of the CR game.  This was also the first time out for this group.  Cory Joseph was the best player on the 2019 World Cup team. Tristan Thompson was the best player on the 2016 Olympic qualifying team. 20-year old Andrew Wiggins was the best player on the 2015 team.  What does why does this keep happening to Canada basketball? mean? This is the first time they fielded a good team and they lost an overtime game. And even though their roster is solid it's not like they have a superstar on it.
"Jamal Murray is a FIBA god too btw, him and Barrett had some great moments for us and are pretty committed to the program. Add SGA and future projected top 3 pick in Elijah Fisher, we got some great talent coming up. Also having Wiggins finally enter the program is huge, very few non-USA teams can match his natural athleticism, he can basically get buckets whenever he wants.    We came a long way from Cory Joseph and Tristan Thompson being the faces of the program, but I'll always rate those guys."
That’s classic Cory Joseph for you
Thx.  As a professional boxscore reader cory joseph with a -21 on a -2 game raised my attention.
Or Cory Joseph
he gave cory joseph and trey lyles too many minutes... also decided to put dort back in the game so late in the 4th when he shouldve done it earlier
Cory Joseph being -21 in 18 minutes is far less brutal a +/- than I thought it was watching it live.
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that’s also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
he gave cory joseph and lyles too much minutes
"I hope these next few guys pan out better.  We were supposed to have a golden generation. Year after year we had guys go high in the lottery, even two 1st overall picks. Wiggins Bennett Olynyk Stauskas Tristan Thompson Tyler Ennis Cory Joseph. If you told me that there would be 0 all star games played between that group I would have called you a hater."
So we just won on an offensive rebound by Cory Joseph.  I'll take it lol
I love how much Cory Joseph cares about playing for Canada
"Cory Joseph, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell"
"I can't see the link at work but based on the names I'm going to assume 2014 Spurs.   In addition to the ones you named,  Aron Baynes - New Zealand/Australia  Marco Belinelli - Italy  Boris Diaw - France  Cory Joseph - Canada  Tiago Splitter - Brazil"
Cory Joseph? Lol
"That make about the same salaries to make a trade work? Cory Joseph for Kuz, I would do. Send kuz back to his hometown and the contract is 1 year less"
2 2nds and Cory Joseph is my offer for Simmons take it or leave it
Tank Commander Cory Joseph was actually unnervingly good for us lol. It got to the point where we were dreading him suiting up down the stretch.
"Fuck yeah, glad the Piston got it. Tank Commander Cory Joseph did his job! You're fucking welcome friends."
"Raptors have a ring and a decade of success, Pistons have remnants of our past in Cory Joseph and Dwane Casey"
"Philly needs a player to help them contend though. The teams in full rebuild mode have very few of those guys.   Thunder have SGA, who is probably straight up better than Simmons at this point, so I can't imagine they trade him. Other than that, it's basically Kemba and his degenerative knees, a million draft picks, and a G league squad.   Rockets have washed John Wall on one of the league's worst contracts, Eric Gordon, and Christian Wood. No deal there.   Magic could do like, Gary Harris, Terrance Ross, and picks? I don't think Philly is taking Fultz back, and it doesn't make sense to move Isaac. No deal there.  Detroit could offer Grant, Cory Joseph, and picks.  Don't think they would offer a top 5 pick. Don't see a deal there, either."
"Also, with Detroit, they will likely get another high selection tomorrow, along with the fact that they’re very willing to take up reclamation projects (see Jahlil Okafor, Dennis Smith Jr, etc). Their willingness to do that, such as Houston did with Kevin Porter Jr, could lead to them finding multiple gems though smart deals. Plus, they have a lot of seconds to work with thanks to the Cory Joseph and other trades."
"Kyle Lowry fits next to any player, that's part of his appeal. He's a point guard who can play as a SG for another PG (FVV; Delon Wright; Cory Joseph) or be a floor spacer for a scorer (Kawhi; Derozan), or he can be a great playmaker/floor general to get his teams easy baskets for his bigs off PNR (Ibaka; JV; Biyombo) or shooters (Powell; OG). He does this without being exposed on defense and regularly switches on bigs and holds his ground. I can't understate Lowry's versatility despite being a 6'0 PG. He's always played 2 roles for this team, carry our bench lineups as the main offensive player/scorer, and than play a more secondary playmaker role once we have our starters in."
"Canada has Wiggins, RJ Barrett, Cory Joseph, Dwight Powell, Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Trey Lyles, Mychal Mulder, and home court so it will be tough for Turkey to qualify, but should be a good tourney with Greece and China also having decent teams."
Ben Simmons+picks for Jerami Grant and Cory Joseph Ben Simmons for D’Angelo Russell
I mean SGA is the star player for OKC and he does have some deep playoff experience his rookie year.  Then RJ was the 2nd best player on a playoff team.  No lengthy resume outside of Cory Joseph but some really good young talent.
"I mean, this decision making process &amp; thinking brought to you by the organization that thought it was a good idea to take Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic, Trae Young or JJJ and the organization that thought it was best to lose Bogdanovic for nothing because they needed more minutes for Buddy Hield &amp; Cory Joseph.  If they made good decisions they wouldn't be the Kings"
Cory Joseph
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"If everybody is healthy and chooses to play for you guys you would be silver medal favorites imo with a chance of upsetting USA for gold.  You’ve got Murray/SGA/Brooks/Wiggins/Olynyk   Then Cory Joseph/Dort/RJ/Boucher/Birch  And that’s still leaving off some solid guys like Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell, Oshae Brisset, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  That’s a lot of talent, and if they commit to the three year plan then they’re for sure strong contenders"
Cory Joseph has pretty much been to the only one to consistently accept the invitation.
That’s NBA champion Cory Joseph
That's because the pg is Cory Joseph
"The gift of Vlade. The 1 year we had cap space before buddy/fox extensions kicked in we spent 40 mil on Dedmon, Ariza, and Cory Joseph."
"It's fun watching other teams wheel and deal their stars, I guess. Either way, it's not really a problem until it's an actual problem. We played Cory Joseph 21 minutes a game last year. We also played Fox, Hield, and Haliburton together in 50 games (Fox and Haliburton injuries prevented more) last year averaging 12 minutes per game. We'll find time for Davion Mitchell.  We're high on Mitchell right now, but we don't KNOW how good he's going to be against NBA guards. We don't know how quickly he'll adjust. We don't know when he's going to hit the rookie wall. We don't know whether we're going to have injuries that free up more time or whether Mitchell himself is going to get hurt and not need the time. We don't know whether he'll even DESERVE that much playing time. We don't know whether this is going to be a problem yet, but lots of people seem to want to solve it."
"Why is it pretentious though? He was the best player on a team that was consistently winning 50 games there are only a handful of guys in the league you can say that about. in 15-16 the Raps won 56 games. Their top 8 guys in the rotation were Lowry, Demar, Carroll, JV, Cory Joseph, Patrick Patterson, Bismack Biyombo, and Terrence Ross. OKC had Durant, Westbrook, Serge and Adams and won 55."
Steve Nash: 2.9 a:to ratio  Cory Joseph: 2.9 a:to ratio Just FYI since I guess a:to is how we determine who’s a better passer now
"They waived him because he was guaranteed $5 million if they didn't waive him. They now signed him to a minimum contract.  This was a cost saving move, and the Pistons did the same with Cory Joseph.   Note - the Pistons received McGruder &amp; Joseph via trades...they didn't give them those contracts initially."
"I'm not loving Killian as the main ball handler and playing Cade off ball but he's at least got some juice and will be fun to watch.   D Rose, Wright, Cory Joseph, Frank Jackson, and Josh Jackson does not sound a fun combo of guards to watch.    Respect for watching all those games tho, I can't say I suffered through all the Thunder games during the 2nd half tank job of last season."
"Our backcourt was a mess. Easily the worst backcourt in the league. Revolving door of players. Some Killian, some D Rose, some Delon Wright, some Cory Joseph, some Saben Lee, some Frank Jackson, some Josh Jackson, some Diallo, and even a little McGruder.     If I had to guess, I would say that Wright got the most starts at PG, and Josh Jackson got the most starts at SG. I could totally be wrong, but I watched literally every game, and I'm not sure without looking it up. So, I fault absolutely no one for not being up on all that mess.  Cade solidifies one of the positions, but we're still looking for someone to step up and claim the other guard spot. Beef Stew (or maybe Olynyk) will fill out the C position now that Plumlee was moved."
"&gt;Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF  I don't think you will see a ""lot"" of that.  Casey and the front office have stressed how important shooting is this year. For that reason, Frank Jackson &amp; Saddiq Bey will be playing a lot of SG/SF.  Also, if we re-sign Hamidou Diallo (which I expect), there is another guy who will be playing at the SF spot."
"shoot 4-9 too for 3, the rest of the team shoot 3-26  Coach is trying to make Lee, Hayes and Cade work together.   Lee as primary ball handler, Hayes more of a 2, and Cade working as SF.  shit looked terrible vs okc and looked terrible today, if Cade is always in the corner playing SF, is a bit harder to drawing FT.  Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF.  Pain."
Cory Joseph
"Hahaha didnt expect that answer. We have had Cory Joseph, Anthony Bennett, Oshee Brissett recently.  Currently we have Chris Boucher, Khem Birch and Dalano Banton. We are good for Canadian content.  I like Powell but i completely understand why they want more with that 2 year contract (even if 2nd year is a partial guarantee)"
Luka for Cory Joseph and a 2nd Round Pick. Who says no?
"Damn, team GTA can’t buy a point guard these days…. Cory Joseph it is…."
Ok Murray can have his own All-Kitchener team. Toronto downgrades to…Cory Joseph?
I would wait a year and then send out Cory joseph and absorb him into our cap space(we have the potential to get like 50 mil of cap space).  Him and jerami could be an interesting pair of wings at the 3 and 4
"Nope. The only reason the Kings got #9, and the Pistons got #1 is a Mr. Cory Joseph. Guy blew a game winning layup in his first game with Detroit"
Isn't this about Cory Joseph?

"I think he'd be a great add to the Pistons or Pelicans, who could use some help still, can take a risk, and still pay him alright at least.   Pistons obviously aren't using him over Cade but rn their other options are Josh Jackson (better fit as an SF imo), Hamidou Diallo (better fit as an SF imo), and Cory Joseph (better fit as a PG imo). I guess they could technically slide DSJ over but again, fit thing. Just as a 3rd/4th guard he adds a decent amount.  Pels wise he's better than Satoransky, I think NAW and Graham are both actually great and will impress this year, but again, could use a little bench depth at G rn and Nunn is better than your average 3rd/4th guy, especially at the budget it looks like he'll be available at."
"because we havent signed cory joseph to a multi year $24mil dear, its baby steps with the kings dude."
That’s good value for them. Cory Joseph is a solid player
Weaver is garbage.  Moved down 20 spots to trade Plumlee so he could overpay a dirty Kelly O coming off a contract year where he padded his stats on a league worst Houston team.  Then he signs Cory Joseph to a 2 year / 10M deal and follows it up with this Lyles signing.  Fucking idiot
u mean nba champion cory joseph
It's more of a matter of cap flexibility - you got 3 guys on your roster now making over 30M a year.  There's a decent amount of bargain-bin guys I'd be interested in; take Dennis on a reduced deal if he comes back with a tail between his legs. Wouldn't mind either Avery Bradley or Cory Joseph on a min. Same with Austin Rivers.  I'd hate to see them pry away TJ McConnell or Patty Mills but there's a few more names.
That's 2014 champion Cory Joseph.
Lol sixers  can't even get nba champion Cory Joseph to join them 😂
I WILL NOT TOLERATE CORY JOSEPH SLANDER
THATS NBA CHAMPION CORY JOSEPH TO U SIR😤
We're going to be stuck with Cory Joseph aren't we?
Is Cory Joseph a starting caliber PG?
"Lowry would be nice if he wasn't headed to Miami. Brogdon if he could be pried away, Dragic. And yes I'm thirsty enough to say that I'd take Cory Joseph."
"Dejounte, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson all look pretty good considering where they were drafted. Kyle Anderson was good while a Spur, not sure where you're getting the idea that he only blossomed in Memphis. These are also guys being drafted at the end of the 1st round, where expected value is very low but they manage to get contributors more often than other teams.   Going back further you have Parker, Ginobili, Cory Joseph, George Hill, Tiago Splitter. The highest pick of any of those guys was like 26."
"I remember few years ago, Cory Joseph is the only NBA player in Team Canada so disappointing given the fact that we have the 2nd most number of NBA player."
A nice steady point guard off the bench good alot but not great at anything fits the bill. Someone like cory Joseph.
Cory Joseph
"I offered you Siakam and OG for Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Murray, Keldon and White... You're taking that deal."
"White, Murray, and Johnson are all good players. Kyle Anderson and Cory Joseph both had paid after their rookie deals in SA. Walker/Vassell are too young to tell. Plus... they scouted and hit on Kawhi... regardless if every other pick flopped, they rang Erneh."
"Both the Wizards and Sacramento get screwed. I don’t think Hield is a remarkable player but he is a more than serviceable starter even on a good team, and to think it’s a fair trade for two bench players just kind of shows how biased most laker fans are.  Imagine me suggesting Sac could trade Glen Robinson and Cory Joseph for KCP."
"That’s an outstanding draft record  Pick 15 for an MVP level player is amazing.  Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Murray, Keldon and White as solid role players at 28-30 is as solid as you can get with those picks."
We somehow found 21.5 minutes a game for Cory Joseph last year before the trade deadline. I'm sure we can find something similar for Davion Mitchell. And there'll be plenty of room to do that if Buddy gets traded.
"Parker and Ginobilli were from 20 years ago. Stop thinking that Spurs could consistently pull an all-star from low 20s pick.  People conveniently like to forget the mediocrity of Loonie, Derrick White, Slomo, Cory Joseph, George Hill, Splitter or the absolute disaster like James Anderson, Dejuan Blair and Ian Mahinmi.  Whether Pop wants to admit it or not, the Spurs has entered the rebuilding mode. It's better for us to wait for an all-star potential player rather than getting a collection of mediocre players now.  I'd rather wait for Knicks to offer the 19th pick and Obi than 22nd and Kuzma"
"Bryn is the type of guy who is a solid role player in the exact right situation but can be horribly exposed when asked to do more than what he's capable of. He busts his ass and is a good guy.   He's also the type of role player that some dumbass FO will overpay, projecting him into a bigger role coming off his success with the Bucks. Spurs fans know both ends of this with Bryn and have seen other teams poach our role players and from Jonathan Simmons to Aron Baynes to Cory Joseph, they never achieve the kind of success their new team envisions.   Unfortunately, Bryn is also the kind of guy that's easy to scapegoat. Spurs fans were merciless in blaming him for everything despite his stellar play 2 years ago as essentially our point guard for half the season as we took Denver to 7 games in the playoffs."
"Austin Rivers HS mixtape was always pretty sick to me. Doc Rivers, Cory Joseph and John Wall are all in it too. Pretty sure Austin wears his Dads jersey in a dunk contest which was pretty cool.  Edit: https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=160&amp;v=OJX8YUrItR8&amp;feature=emb_logo"
There's a post above that still thinks we have Cory Joseph available for trade.
"They should trade for Valenciunas, Ibaka too   Maybe sign Norm Powell, Cory Joseph, and PatPat   That’s a hell of a squad"
Skip to My Lou maybe after them. Or Cory Joseph.   Whoops forgot Alvin Williams.
"Haha, yeah, i don't know why he used all three Antetokounmpos and then reused guys like Cory Joseph and Blake Griffin. What surprised me even more was when i scrolled up to see he DIDN'T have a Clippers flair."
"And it's this kind of stuff that makes me not worry so much about not having enough minutes to go around. We want this team to be able to go hard on offense and defense while running a high pace. Mitchell's gonna hit that rookie wall, or maybe we get an injury to Fox, Haliburton, or Hield. There will be playing time. Cory Joseph got 20 minutes a game with this team last year."
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
Don’t forget the goat Cory Joseph
"Geez they really killed it in that 26-30 range for years. Tony Parker (28) in '01, Udrih (28) in '04, Mahinmi (28) in '05, Splitter (28) in '07, George Hill (26) in '08, Cory Joseph (29) in 2011, Slo-Mo (30) in 2014, Dejounte (29) in 2016, Derrick White (29) in 2017, Keldon (29) in 2019. Consistently solid selections in that area of the first round"
Cory Joseph at 29 is still a pretty big W of a pick tho
"Any team in the league could've traded for the 30th pick to get Jimmy. Hell, the Spurs probably could've acquired Kawhi, Cory Joseph *and* Jimmy Butler.   Does it really matter? Cory Joseph was a good pick at 29 anyway."
"Cory Joseph isn't a draft bust, and the Spurs ended up trading their PG of the future in George Hill for Kawhi Leonard. Keep in mind at this point in time the Spurs had been touting Hill as Parkers replacement, even [benching](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/384498-george-hill-revives-spurs-emerges-a-star-the-other-side-of-vinsanity) Parker in actual important playoff games."
Compared to a lot of the players in that Draft Cory Joseph has had a solid career.
where i can find the mistake you're talking about?  Because Cory Joseph is clearly a better player
Cory Joseph hasn’t even peaked yet. You just wait.
Just cut to the chase and pick up Cory Joseph
"This is a list of guards who're all within 2 inches of Steph and clearly better defenders - Kyle Lowry, FVV, Fox, Cory Joseph, Schroder, Delon Wright, Hali, Beverley, Jrue, Smart, Conley, Neto, Rubio, Jevon Carter, Kris Dunn, Dinwiddie, Rozier, Donte, Caruso, KCP, Brogdon, Josh Hart."
Cory Joseph and Aaron Baynes
"Cory Joseph, MVP."
"I've met LeBron before. He's pretty douchey but puts on a great face for the cameras and the kids. This was when he went back to Cleveland. On the other hand Tristan Thompson was super friendly, which may come as a surprise to a lot of people.   Giannis on the other hand, is one of the nicest people I've ever met. The only nicer NBA player I've met is Cory Joseph.   On a random note, Joe Young who had a cup of coffee for the NBA players is a real douche, and Avery Bradley is pretty douchey as well."
"that cory joseph shot was at the beginning of the 15-16 season, if i remember correctly.  that season stands out to me because we had made the playoffs the 2 years prior, and we make the playoffs the 2 years after that."
Dwayne Casey’s the main reason why he didn’t develop. Giving minutes to Cory Joseph and Wayne Ellington instead of developing Sekou. They were a crap team last season — and still a crap team next season
"Considering Cory Joseph and the Pistons did something similar this off-season, I could see Jordan and Nets working something similar out."
"Back during the 2011 nba lockout, I somehow had the opportunity rebound for the spurs during the ""unofficial shooting practices"". It was all the rookies at the time: Dejuan blair, Danny green, Cory Joseph, James anderson, cant remember if Kawhai was there. Interestingly the gym was at some dude's mansion that had a full court gym at his house.  Anyway everyday the only vet was Tim working on his fundamentals on the other side of the court. He drove there in his audi R8 Lol.  As a side note, Danny Green's shot looked absolutely broken to me. I thought he was going to be a bust in the nba."
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"That's a really bad take... Paul has guys like Harrell, Cory Joseph, and Mitchell Robinson who make well below 58 million.   Yes, if he did not follow on his duty as a agent he is wrong. But the dude handles contracts well below what Noel was offered."
"This is just not true haha. Draymond, Bledsoe, Cory Joseph, and many other players have all gotten paid under rich Paul."
"Dennis Smith jr. was actually decent on the defensive end for the Pistons last season, tbh I prefer him over Cory Joseph, but it is what it is. He deserves another go with another team."
"Actually they really did need Patty. He was hurt in 2013, but maybe it wouldnt have mattered because Cory Joseph was still around.   I disagree with your comment that Ben would have been a better fit. Im not saying Patty is better, but the fit might not have been there."
"jokes aside, sixers should trade for Cory Joseph just as some PG insurance while this Simmons saga slowly erodes. Their offense is weak af rn"
Cory Joseph
"These dudes don't really know what they're talking about. Just an FYI. Buddy is probably, and still currently our 2nd best player on the team purely on stats. He's older and the core is much younger. He is a pure shooter and elite rebounder for a guard. He has below average defense because he keeps his eyes too much on the ball and loses his man, which is something I don't know how the coaching hasn't caught yet and try to change. He doesn't have good handles, but his threat is so strong he commands double teams every time he brings the ball up.  His issues last year was that he was given the responsibility of ball handling, play making and leading the 2nd unit when he doesn't have elite skills in any of that, yet he was tasked with doing that. The King's fanbase will 180* on players at the drop of a hat.   Buddy is best when he can be a perimeter threat and drive down to finish as a catch and shoot player. With Davion being the point guard for the 2nd unit, he can be that guy and his game will vastly improve. Last season he was paired with Cory ""Power Dribble God"" Joseph, leading the second unit and he was awful."
"I know so many people changed channel furious when Cory Joseph hit that buzzer beater 2 because it killed Bulls covering, they have no idea it got reviewed and taken off"
Ben Simmons to the Detroit Pistons for Cory Joseph?
You gonna do our boy Cory Joseph like that?
"It's because Luke sucks absolute ass. It doesn't matter that Buddy Hield is the 3rd best shooter in the league because Luke has him running sets as the primary ball handler giving up lobs to Damion Jones instead of shooting and having someone distribute to him. He puts Cory Joseph in at an average of 24 minutes a game last season and put him up against Zach Lavine for 36 minutes and literally gives him career highlights.   Like I said ***on paper*** the kings are better outside of their 2 best players 1:1. But in practice they are not.   The options right now on the kings are:  1. Fox 2. Haliburton 3. Hield 4. Barnes  Those are the top scoring/playing options on the Kings at the moment. Luke will find a way to fuck this up.   Basketball is complex in it's simplicity and you are just playing for inches at a time. The fit and playstyle of the kings doesn't fit with the roster. They are one of the slowest in pace with the fastest player in the league. Luke plays free dribble basketball and ONLY plays man to man defense. Literally high school level coaching shit. The team just isn't fit well together and doesn't have the stopping power needed on defense to make any kind of serious run. We'll see how it works this season with the roster change, but I don't have any hopes really. We were 9-10th in scoring last season and dead last in defense. Blazers made it to the playoffs with 12th scoring and 25th defense. So realistically if we just had literally average or even just below average by all metrics we should make the playoffs. But somehow, some way, Luke will try to make this into a Might Ducks feelgood movie moment and play our 15th man at a crucial point in the game to try to create some kind of heartfelt breakout moment or some shit. I just know it. He'll sub Fox out for like Justin James or some shit."
Unbiased but  Cade: Luka  Green: MJ without the defense  Mobley: AD  Barnes: Draymond Green with a jumper/handle  Suggs: Jrue Holiday   Floor  Cade: Kyle Anderson  Green: Malik Monk  Mobley: Jabari Parker with D  Barnes:   Suggs: Cory Joseph
"Too early but I’m liking our bench of   Cory Joseph  Josh jackson Hamidou Diallo Trey Lyles Kelly Olynyk  3 of these guys shoot the three at a solid % while Cojo is good at running the unit along with both Josh and Hami being good cutters and defenders. Not to mention Cojo, Lyles and KO got good synergy being they played for the Canadian National team."
Casey also loved running lines with Delon Wright or Cory Joseph in for one of the forwards and sliding up DeMar so they had 3 ball handlers. Even did it a bit with Vasquez a while back
" PLAYER | CAP FIGURE  ---|---|---- Blake Griffin | $29,764,126| DeAndre Jordan | $7,875,533 |  Dewayne Dedmon |$2,866,667|  Cory Joseph | $2,400,000 |  Deividas Sirvydis |$1,517,981 |  Zhaire Smith| $1,068,200 |"
"According to bballrefrence their dead money is at $44.4M. Is there someone missing?   Blake Griffin - $29,784,216  DeAndre Jordan - $7,875,533  Dewayne Dedmon - $2,866,667  Cory Joseph - $2,400,000 (from his prior contract)   Deividas Sirvydis - $1,517,981  This totals $44,424,397 in dead money for Detroit, which is higher than the Thunders payroll as of right now. As OKC guarantees contracts, it's likely to bring their payroll above this though.  Side note: OKC is still paying Kyle Singler 1M/year this season and next."
"Dedmon, I think. Still missing about 5 million.  Edit: Cory Joseph"
"I played against Cory Joseph in the provincial championship tournament in Ontario in 2008. I scored 2 points on him. The one thing I remember was just how quick he was. He could score at will (obvs) but he took it easy on me because his brother (Devoe Joseph) was the star of the team at the time.  Fast forward about 10 years, the company I work for was shooting a basketball Canada commercial which Jamal Murray and Cory Joseph starred in. I got to talk to Cory for a short bit and mentioned how I scored 2 points on him back in the day and he quipped back ""that was 2 more points than you should have had"". We both laughed, I got my picture and that was that."
Wait when did Cory Joseph go to- actually nah I seen him a few times.
"2011: Cory Joseph &gt; Jimmy Butler  2012: Festus Ezeli (pick traded to GS before draft) &gt; Jeffery Taylor  2013: Livio Jean-Charles &gt; Archie Goodwin  2014: Kyle Anderson &gt; Damien Inglis  2015: Nikola Milutinov &gt; Larry Nance Jr.  Butler and Nance would be significant upgrades over a journeyman backup PG and a big man who played zero NBA minutes respectively. Ezeli had a longer NBA career than Taylor, winning a championship with the Warriors even. Goodwin has the advantage of getting to play in the NBA compared to Jean-Charles. Anderson to Inglis is a major downgrade.  Not the end of the world though, given how the Spurs were in contention during this period."
Cory Joseph is garbage.
"Killian Hayes, Cory Joseph"
What’s Pistons fans take on Cory Joseph? I personally find His two first names sus
"If you haven't watched him lately, he's (incredibly) actually regressed a lot even from last season. I'll watch Cory Joseph when I get the chance, it'd be cool to see another team playing someone worse than WCS."
"I am a Kings fan. I have watched enough WCS to know I don't want to watch him anymore. Watching him and Cory Joseph, I would rather have WCS."
"Haven't watched Cory Joseph, but I really doubt it. If you wanna cringe, watch a Mavs game and look at WCS closely."
Cory Joseph
He's better than Cory Joseph.
HOW DOES HE KEEP DOING THIS? Luke Walton ALSO played Cory Joseph 23+ minutes a night.
Cory Joseph. Like half of our fan base despises him.
It’s very interesting to hear you say that because I watched two Pistons games for the first time this last week and Cory Joseph looked SO lost.  Like doesn’t belong in the nba anymore lost.  Especially bad on a terrible team lost.
Cory Joseph
You’ve gotta be crazy if you think either of those two are the worst.   Cory Joseph Darius Bazley Avery Bradley
Us Pistons fans hate Cory Joseph. Its honestly hilarious at this point. We have a lot of young guards on our team that need development and coach Casey still plays Cory 20+ minutes a game. Every time he gets checked into the game or even touches the ball most people on the reddit go into a fit of rage. It also doesn't help that he's not a good player.
"Man I still go back to check on the Kings to see how they are run hopeful that they turn the corner and what meets me? Failure. Cousins looks like an all star? Fire the coach he likes and precede to piss of Cousins. They jump all the way to the second pick with Luka, my number 1 prospect in that draft guess they better take Bagley. Oh they look somewhat decent with Joerger and Fox? Turns out Joerger is an a-hole and gets fired and replaced with Walton. The Kings win 39 games and look to grow? They sign Barnes to a market value contract and overpay Cory Joseph, Dewayne Dedmon, and Trevor Ariza to make a playoff push. I want the Kings to be good in fact I want them to be great but all I see is a trail of memes and the KANGZ all steps of the way. Now Simmons is available and they won’t consider trading like the 15th best point guard in Fox and a decent if unspectacular prospect like Haliburton. Haliburton is unlikely to be even top 10 pint guard in his prime with the amount of PG talent that flows through the draft."

"Because someone on the top 75 in their supposed prime failing to lead or carry a team is noteworthy. Did you forget about all the shit Melo got for failing to lead the Knicks anywhere? This is pretty typical of a superstar status player: you get paid the big bucks to be that big name. Let’s not act like there isn’t a cost to anything. The dude is making outrageous money and this is the cost of that, he’s gonna get singled out.  We obviously don’t give a fuck if Terrence Ross or Tyler Zeller or fucking Cory Joseph have a bad game or something. That’s not news. A guy who is paid to BE THAT GUY and failing constantly is a discussion point.  “Guess what? Cory Joseph only got 1 assist the other night, what does this mean for his legacy?” doesn’t hold any weight, come on."
Cory Joseph is so cheeks. He reminds me of Danuel House lmao
"Kawhi, Patty Mills, and Cory Joseph the only guys left in the league from the 2014 championship roster."
"Will this be the catalyst to bring the lakers together?! LBJ attacked openly! Melo and Cory Joseph verbally battling! Beef Stew storming the lockers, will he be suspended?? Will The King face the repercussions of his actions?!  Find out next week on, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION!!"
"Cory Joseph: ""Cade is getting better each and every day, and he's already becoming a leader. When he's at the point, it is like we have another coach on the floor."""
There was mention of Cade holding him back repeatedly.  Of course his team mates (Cade and Cory Joseph) would know him so well.  This guy (Stewart) must be insane in practices.
"Some context on why CoJo was over there:  &gt;	QUESTION: Why wasn’t Cory Joseph assessed a technical foul?  &gt;FOSTER: After Isaiah Stewart left the court, Cory was anticipating he may come around the back of house and enter the Laker bench from the opposite side. So, he was going to intercept him. I actually told Cory that would be good.  From the [NBA Pool Report](https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-ejection-of-lebron-james-and-isaiah-stewart-in-the-third-quarter-of-tonights-los-angeles-lakers-at-detroit-pistons-game/)"
Cory Joseph actually said he ran to the lakers bench because when he saw him run like that he assumed he was going around the back of house out the lakers hallway to get to lebron lol. And people say he didn’t really want smoke 😂 his own teammates are scared he’s gonna do something.
Cory Joseph All-Defence
Cory Joseph with the future vision
yes but we obviously know why he’s not playing. No reason a non-contender should start Cory Joseph instead of letting their young guys cook.
"&gt;QUESTION: Why wasn’t Cory Joseph assessed a technical foul?  &gt;FOSTER: After Isaiah Stewart left the court, Cory was anticipating he may come around the back of house and enter the Laker bench from the opposite side. So, he was going to intercept him.  I actually told Cory that would be good.  Damn Foster.. you being so reasonable is sus too"
Because Cory Joseph has higher potential and deserves more playing time in his rookie season
Gotta give Cory Joseph all the playing time he can handle
"I mean we're tanking so fine, but this loss is squarely on Casey. He let the Lakers come back from down 13 without any of our best players on the court. Of course fucking Cory Joseph and Josh Jackson are going to blow that lead, and Casey wanted it to happen. No serious coaching attempt would let that lineup stay out there without even calling a timeout."
Cory Joseph on AD there….
Cory Joseph is the man. He's not great but he executes plays and plays hard
Cory Joseph is lucky he didn't get an elbow to the windpipe there
Cory Joseph being escorted back onto the court by two cops in the background was hilarious
cory joseph leaving russ wide ass open lmao
&gt;When Cory Joseph checks into the game
"The preparedness before the last attempt and the reaction after that from Cory Joseph, hits deep.."
last week one of my opponents tried to offer me a trade of Kelly Olynyk + Mitchell Robinson + Cory Joseph in exchange for  LeBron + Jaylen Brown 😔. I obviously declined the offer and still lost (still winless in my fantasy league) but damn those injuries have my team disrespected
Solid game by Cade. They need to run more offense through Cade. So much of the game was the Cory Joseph show
That's captain of the Canadian national team Cory Joseph to you.
That's 2014 NBA Champion Cory Joseph to you :)
Alarming to see how important Cory Joseph can be to a team in 2021
"I took exception to ""just got lucky to be drafted to the spurs"" in that comment. I don't even mind Parker not being top 75. But to say he is what is just cause he got drafted to the right team is bullshit. So did Nando De Colo and Cory Joseph. They didn't become All stars."
"Casey has been doing the same thing though. Their first win against us they benched all their young guys until garbage time and rode Kelly Olynk and Cory Joseph to get the win. Pistons fans are constantly complaining about how much playing time their vets have gotten, starting or not doesn't mean much. Bey is the only young guy on the team who's averaging 30 or more minutes."
"For a backup, Trey Lyles has been solid. Don't know what you're getting at with that. Cory Joseph on the other hand..."
I like your predictions Did you also have the Pistons going 70-0 for the rest of the season?  End record **73-9**  Clean Sweep all the way through the Finals.  Finals MVP: **Cory Joseph**  It’s happening r/NBA
The Mutual Teammates of George Mikan &amp; Cade Cunningham:  1.	⁠Mikan played with Bob Harrison on the ‘50 Minneapolis Lakers.  2.	⁠Harrison played with Bob Petit on the ‘55 Milwaukee Hawks.  3.	⁠Petit played with Jeff Mullins on the ‘65 St. Louis Hawks.  4.	⁠Mullins played with Gus Williams on the ‘76 Warriors.  5.	⁠Mullins played with Kevin Willis on the ‘87 Atlanta Hawks.  6.	⁠Willis played with Duncan on the ‘03 Spurs.  7.	⁠Duncan played with Cory Joseph on the 2012 Spurs.  8.	⁠Joseph played with Cade Cunningham on the 2022 Pistons.
"Cory Joseph is good, but if you have him you live in Cory Joseph world."
"That was a really well played game by Killian Hayes.   Casey really took his ""making bizarre coaching decisions in order to play Cory Joseph more minutes"" level to another dimension today when he had Cade, Killian, and Cory all on the court at the same time."
well who's going to stop Cory Joseph 's career night then?
"Cory Joseph  Our teams ass in general but man he's done a 180  Last year we hated him cause he kept playing too good almost winning us games. This year he's been ass when Saben Lee, who's been averaging 30+ points in the gleague so far, could be coming off the bench getting more NBA minutes in"
"You just summed up the Pistons fanbase. Fuck Cory Joseph holy shit. I hate his ass so much, orthopaedic turnover machine"
I’m not a Killian hayes stan by any means but a lot of people who say this just aren’t watching. He obviously can’t score at all but he plays great defense and the offense flows when he’s on the floor. Not saying he’s a starting level PG or anything but he absolutely is an NBA player. Better than Cory Joseph at this point
"Absolutely. It's such a strange formula for success that keeps working.  In the past decade, they've had back-half FRPs pan out like nobody's business.   Kyle Anderson, Cory Joseph, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker. None of these guys had any significant playing time their rookie year. Maybe they know something we don't."
Cory Joseph is one of the worst possible players the Kings have ever had. During his tenure on the Kings luke was playing him like 23-28 minutes a night against the other team and he'd just get hunted like a motherfucker. Luke played him 36 minutes against Zach lavine and Lavine put up his career highs on Joseph.
WE WOULD NEVER Cory Joseph back again. Ever.
that would be something if Cory Joseph gets traded back to Sacramento after getting traded from Sacramento to Detroit last season lol
We havent been playing Hami who i guess hasnt been performing in practice.  Unfortunate if true cause i love hami and would easily play him over Cory Joseph and Frank Jackson off the bench

I just love how in control Cade is. I also hate how out of control we get when Cory Joseph comes in.  And I really think he's quicker or at least more agile than people think. He's getting more and more separation for himself.
Cory Joseph
Cory Joseph highkey cheeks
I fucking hate Cory Joseph.
"If anything, wouldn't the modern day Spurs be the talent farm?  Bryn Forbes, Johnathan Simmons, Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Ian Mahinmi, all started on the Spurs and became key rotation players, got a big contract, and/or won a chip.   I could be missing some people. I wasnt sure if I should add kawhi in that."
Fuck Cory Joseph!
fuck cory joseph!!!
"Saben Lee dropped 42/8/8 in his first G League game, he has no business being there. Fuck Cory Joseph FREE SABEN LEE"
More like Spurs being a talent farm for the Raptors. Spurs sent so much time and care developing Cory Joseph as well.
"Cory Joseph, if he played maybe 10-15 mins a game I'd be ok but nah instead he gets 20-25. Unless he's just left wide open he makes a decent play once every like 3 games"
"Oh sweet a Pistons post. I'll also add Cory Joseph pounding the ball into the floor for 18 seconds, and Killian Hayes."
"Cory Joseph  Disliked him last year for playing too well off the bench frequently almost getting us wins when we wanted to lose.  Now i dislike him cause he hasnt been as good as he was last year and is eating up minutes i'd like to see Saben Lee get.  No hate though, seems like a good vet presence and liked by the squad. I just wanna see a sophomore develop at the nba level"
"So near sighted. When the Spurs drafted Kawhi they already had a core that was a few years removed from multiple championships. Then they had a new bull to take the reigns.  Raptors did the same thing with FVV and Siakam. They had Lowry, DeRozan, Ibaka, Carroll, JV, Tucker, Cory Joseph, etc.  They let FVV and Siakam mature and lead the bench and a few years later they win a championship as the core.  You could have had your next backcourt when Klay and Steph were fading. It’s why you take best player available in the draft or trade down for other assets/futures."

He looked solid tonight despite the poor shooting in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. He wasn’t afraid of taking big shots in the 4th and he was able to get Detroit back into the game with Cory Joseph. His playmaking continues to improve and he looks more resolved when deciding between passing and shooting. His defense needs work tho. His over commitment got him into foul trouble early.   Once Cade’s shots start to fall he’ll be very fun to watch.
Good fight from the boys today. Would have looked different with Killian out there instead of Cory Joseph

I don't understand why we're paying Cory Joseph $7M when we could have Langston Galloway on a minimum.
"Every time I watch a Pistons game I chance upon a Cory Joseph outburst, usually directed at teammates. Whatever Luke Walton did, he instilled a whole lot of confidence in Joseph, I guess..."
And Cory Joseph is.. well he's still in the NBA.
Cory Joseph is the living embodiment of Casey’s ideologies
shout out to you for actually watching the game. are you saying letting Cory Joseph and Killian Hayes initiate offense while Cade sits in the corner like Kyle Korver isn’t a good idea?
I can't wait to never see Cory Joseph again. I wish we still had Ish Smith or something instead.
"Lowery was every bit the player he is now, Jonas, Carroll, Cory Joseph, Patterson back when he was good. That was a deeper team than the Bulls with Noah, Taj, trick-or-treat Mirotich, and washed Pau. And you don’t even want to talk about that Wade Rondo season…  And Noah might have finished top 5 in MVP and I love that guy he was one of the 2 best centers in the league at the time with Marc. However that was at a time without the kinda top end talent we have at the position now and he wasn’t one of the 15 best players in the league. The fact that one of our best offensive options was going point Joakim was pretty telling how limited those teams were from a offensive standpoint.  And playing playoff results over a short period of time doesn’t tell the story. Matchups and injuries play way to large a roll in the small samples sizes of playoff runs. Tying team playoff performance to a single guy like that is dumb anyway. See one Chris Paul, was he not that good before last season?  I was watching obscene amounts of basketball from 2012-2017 several games a night and especially the Eastern conference since I really enjoyed watching a lot of those teams like the Wall Wizards, Demar and Kyle Raptors, PG Pacers, on and on. Jimmy was just a better player. But don’t get me wrong Demar was great, deserving winner of multiple All-NBA spots not calling him some scrub or anything here."
"I don't mean to toot our own horn too much, but this makes what the Spurs have done even more exceptional.   Obviously you have huge success stories like Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili....but even in the last 10-ish years we've pulled guys like George Hill, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Tre Jones, etc...out of the late first to second rounds, or even undrafted.  Our last three lottery picks were Kawhi (15th), Devin Vassell (14th), and Josh Primo (12th).   Kawhi is obviously Kawhi, Vassell is looking great in his 2nd year, and Primo shows all the signs of a young star in the making.   Sure, we've had some whiffs like Luka Samanic, but that is a lot of success stories coming that late in the draft."

There is literally no way to explain Casey’s love for Cory Joseph.
"Someone needs to intervene and stop him from deploying these rotations. Even if Killian is complete shit, they would be better off running Saddiq as the primary ball handler and getting more minutes for Pickett or Saben Lee. There is literally nothing to gain from these games where Cory Joseph plays 20+ minutes."

Why the fuck would you do that to yourselves? Cory Joseph is literally bottom 5 of all players who play 10 minutes or more in every advanced metric.
CORY JOSEPH - TAKING TRADE OFFERS NOW
And that foul on cory joseph. It’s worse coz they reviewed it
Shit is Cory Joseph okay?
How is that a foul but Cory Joseph holding onto Trezz isn’t?
Cory Joseph
Why would you even include Olynyk or Cory Joseph in there lol
"Who would you say the best Canadian player in the league rn? Between Kelly Olynik, SGA, Jamal Murray, Cory Joseph and RJ Barrett? Tough choices if you ask me"
"Steve Simmons of the Toronto Sun tabloid shit rag is easily the most hated beat reporter in Toronto sports, not just the Raptors. Man gets shit on by the fans, others in the media and the teams. [Brian Burke former GM/President of the Leafs flamed Simmons during his post-firing media availability.](https://twitter.com/itsdeanblundell/status/1274774993650450433) Got shit on by other Raptors beat reporters for asking Masai a ""you talk bout racism in the US but what about crime in Toronto"" question while leaning into the whole ""black on black crime"" shtick that the Toronto Sun always leans into. Fabricated a story about former Leaf Phil Kessel eating hot dogs daily that he doubled down on. Wrote a story about Cory Joseph and Demarre Carroll being at a casino attached to the teams hotel at 2AM before Game 5 of the ECF which was played at 8:30PM. Man is just a trash human being."
Walton makes dumb decisions all game. I’m not surprised Cory Joseph gets a ton of minutes. He’s probably worst coach in the last 10 years.
I don't know what I did in a previous life to be born into this world so dedicated to this team.   I watched the Bulls game where Luke assigned Cory Joseph to Zach Lavine for 36 minutes.
"Walton literally assigned Cojo to guard TAJ GIBSON. Cory Joseph is like 6'1"" and was barely able to keep up with Taj Gibson while running."
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
Cory Joseph is close enough.
I dunno about this man. Watched a lot of kings this year. The talent on the team sucks. Haliburton is pedigree but still a rookie. Fox is good but still not top-tier. Barnes is a consistently average vet presence. Holmes is actually decent and young enough to get better. Buddy can't shoot anymore and is the highest paid on the team this year. Bagley seems like a bust or a role player at best. Bjelica doesn't want to be there. Whiteside is a bit of a scrub these days. Cory Joseph? At least he seems to care. That's pretty much their roster.  I don't mind Luke because at least the young players seem to like him. He's inherited very little and needs some draft picks to get it going.
"It’s a 4 point game and you need the key stop, why the fuck is Cory Joseph in the game"
Yeah part of this is how its defined.   BBall ref its 3 feet and in for shots at the rim. Giannis 82.3% there  CTG uses within 4 feet. Giannis is 79% there. They actually only have that as 90th percentile surprisingly. Someone like Bam per their tracking data is actually very slightly ahead of Giannis right now. Christian Wood isa ctually at 82%. Cory Joseph is at 80%
"I assumed the kings didn't retaliate because they didn't know at the time Metu got hurt. Hell, after JV dunked on Cory Joseph immediately afterwards, they were laughing and joking together! I assume the retaliation will come next game, but I don't know who on the kings will do it."
"Lol or just you know, step aside?? The moment Metu’s leg landed on JV’s shoulder, Jonas immediately grabbed it and suplexed the guy.  Did the same thing to Cory Joseph on the next play, and Cory was sane enough to do the right thing. Punkass btch lol"
"It's coaching. Cory Joseph is not only Luke Walton's go to guy, he plays an absurd amount of minutes despite being literally bottom 20 in the league amongst players who play more than 10 minutes a game. But he gets like 20+ a game and he is always a complete black hole. Too slow on defense to stop any kind of remotely quick defender, too small to guard slow but taller guards, cannot keep ahead of his man at all and he shuffles his feet in this way that he can never not run into his man when they stop. He also cannot fucking score at all.   Yet Luke LOVES playing him. Same as when he played Ariza 22+ minutes a game."
Ehh when the game was actually competitive Whiteside had a good game because DJ did try this game haha. He helped when Fox or Cory Joseph or whoever drove and all our wings were too small to even get into Whiteside's eyeline when the Kings missed. The majority of Whiteside's buckets though were floaters in garbage time and no one was contesting those.
"I'm not sure if it's a coaching thing, but I cant believe after participating in a shoot out and giving up 74 in the first half (still only down 6), the Kings came right back out in the 2nd and did it again and thought maybe Fox/Hield/Barnes would outshoot Kyrie/Harden/Harris.  I understand the Kings always play at a fast pace and have young legs, but Cory Joseph and Bagley were doing work when the pace was slower and they were grinding toward the rim."
"First Joe Ingles (hit 384, 418 if including playoffs), now PJ Tucker. Apparently Cory Joseph is at 292 games. Does anyone have a list of the longest active consecutive games played streaks?"
"He is in danger!!!!!  His legs could buckle and he could fuck up his knees.  What if he falls and Chimeze gets back on defense and his team has to play 4v5?  What if the next time down Chimeze tries the same shit on him because he's a soft target? What if his future opponents see him get sonned and try to mess with him? He's also got a reputation to protect as an enforcer. He also protects the reputation of the Grizzlies, that trash journeymen from trash franchises like the Kings won't get away with disrespecting them.   He had the right response. He continued it up by teabagging Cory Joseph a few minutes later.  &gt;Is tossing a player off your shoulders onto the hard wood extremely dangerous?????? Yes  Last I checked Jonas is not a horse and Chimeze is not a jockey and this is basketball. It's safer for both if Chimeze goes back to the ground!!!!!"
Cory Joseph also was Spurs' 29th pick
"jsimms was already in his mid 20s when he made the spurs roster. cojo was always behind tony parker in the depth chart until toronto signed him. still, imagine if the spurs had picked jimmy butler instead of cory joseph for the 29th pick of the 2011 draft...."
"Sacramento please.  Take Cory Joseph, Jabari Parker, and Nemanja Bjelica."
Lmao it was on his former teammate Cory Joseph too
what about for cory joseph?
Cory Joseph is garbage
Tyrese isn’t anything like Hayward. He runs the second unit and makes Whiteside and Cory Joseph look like real NBA players then closes games. He’s the only guy on our team who can create besides Fox.
"As a desperate Kings fan, I do have some concerns:  1) I want to see what they do against a full strength roster. Most of our wins, a big piece has been out (Kemba, Smart, Murray, PG13, etc). Sixers will be a great test.    2) All but 1 of our wins has been by 10 points or fewer. While it's great that they've been good in the clutch, I would prefer that they extend a 10 point lead to 20 and put the game away. Tempting fate will bite us eventually.    3) Our closing lineup of Fox, Hali, Buddy, Barnes, and Holmes has been damn good. But we have been pretty lucky with injuries/Covid. If one of those players has to miss an extended period of time, our lack of depth will be sorely exposed. Sure, I think Bagley is underutilized of late and can play close to 30mpg, but after that, you're giving Cory Joseph, Glenn Robinson, and Hassan Whiteside big minutes, which you do not want at all.  I'm enjoying the ride right now, but I'll have more faith in them if they're playing this well as we get to the end of the 1st half. They've lost my benefit of the doubt after 15 years of no playoffs."
