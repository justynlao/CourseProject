"But then we're talking about guys like Cade, Jaden Springer, Josh Christopher and others coming into the league. I like Lonzo but he has to add a lot more to his game (more than what guys coming into the league already have) to be an all star. Not saying it won't happen, but we'll see"

"He’ll be a late first rounder. If people think BJ Boston and Josh Christopher are late first rounders, then Juzang definitely is. Juzang was already better in the Pac 12 vs Christopher and now has this NCAA run to boost it.  He was always projected 2nd rounder even before this run...that website you are using is outdated and doesn’t update that often.   A couple of things to note is that he reclassified to move up a year (he’s a young sophomore)...also played AAU ball with the Mobley twins and got massive exposure to NBA scouts already in HS."

Because Denver is really good at drafting do other teams reach for Josh Christopher?
This for me.  He didn't give a shit about college even went so far as to criticize the experience.  It was only shitty because you made it shitty.  Stop blaming the NCAA and blame the NBA and yourself for your wasted year.   One of the reasons teams should stay away from Josh Christopher.  He didn't care about ASU or playing in college.

"Is Jaygup Josh Christopher's nickname?  [It is his nickname](https://heatcheckcbb.com/who-is-josh-christopher-meet-jaygup-an-internet-sensation-and-projected-first-round-2021-nba-draft-pick/)  &gt; Christopher is nicknamed “JayGup,” a monicker created during a basketball camp years ago. The younger brother of Patrick “PatFish” Christopher, an all-Pac-10 honoree and former Utah Jazz guard, Josh adopted “JayGup” as a reference to a guppy fish and a play off of his older brother’s alter ego."
"We need to get rid of one of Wall or Gordon (so Gordon), and then we’ll have plenty of minutes to give out to the young guys. A guard line-up of Wall/KPJ/ Green for most minutes is great and then Augustin and Josh Christopher can soak up the rest.   IMO though, Christopher would really benefit from playing in the G-League primarily so that he can get a lot of on-ball reps. His decision making is pretty mediocre at the moment and he won’t get the needed on-ball  reps to improve in that area on our main roster.  Next off-season we hopefully buy out Wall and then Christopher can step into the minutes that Wall vacated."
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."
Josh Christopher is an interesting case. His defense has been great and he doesn’t have a bad shot but man. He takes the dumbest shots sometimes. Zero awareness in terms of when to just give up the ball. He’s definitely someone who could use some time in the g league to adjust and I think he could be a great player.

"Sophomore year Josh Christopher at Mayfair definitely kicked off short shorts, especially when he wore the boxers in the preseason game"
Josh Christopher brought them back for the youngins. Then Jalen Green. Oubre and Jaylen Brown I know was wearing them early.
"Lonzo ""Josh Christopher"" Ball"
Josh Christopher not shooting well at all but I love the energy he brings.
Josh christopher looks rough this game. Hope he learns from it
Josh Christopher selfish play rubbing off on sengun When he gets it he looking to score every time.  Cuz he know no one passing it to him
Welcome to the league Josh Christopher yeesh rough game for him
"Yes… kind of. As part of the Harden trade the Rockets got a 2022 Bucks 1st, which they flipped along with PJ Tucker and a 2nd for a 2023 first as well as the 24th pick (which became Josh Christopher)"
"Alperen Şengün yelled out, “Işte gidiyorsun! Işte gidiyorsun.” Sharpshooter Jalen Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Josh Christopher yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before KJ Martin hit the locker room door, NBA great Rafael Stone hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
cade outplayed green in personal play. but green outplayed cade in team play. green had to deal with much heavier defense being played on him. and in the moments his team started falling back green was the guy stepping up the most. also josh christopher and to an extent sengun was able to go off so much because they were focusing so much on green.
Josh Christopher. He's the new Rocket I knew the least about but he was getting after it on defense and has a lot of energy.
josh christopher is gonna have a long career as a jordan clarkson type sixth man
Josh Christopher
"Don’t sleep on Josh Christopher either, steal of the draft in my opinion. They also got Garuba who looks like he could be a great Swiss Army knife role player."
"All I know is last night against Detroit, Josh Christopher was fucking amazing."
I love Josh Christopher but was so confused when y'all drafted him since you have so much young guard talent...I hope he finds some playing time on the squad though because he is good.
I fucking love josh Christopher already
And grin nonstop before signing and giving his jersey to Josh Christopher
"I was at the game.  Josh Christopher is playing like a man on fire, as good as Sengun was tonight, Josh was on the same level.  His shot selection in the first game was atrocious especially in the beginning, but he is making plays on offense and defense.  I don’t know who he thinks he is, but he’s upset with EVERYONE that he’s being called a throwaway pick.    His handle looks smooth, and he was distributing the ball better than any tape I’ve seen.  Dude is going to be trouble.  Locking down Cade like he was Jrue Holiday."
"i'm just so impressed with them. also, i really didn't expect josh christopher to look as good as this. can't wait to see garuba added to the mix. i've just been absolutely thrilled ever since the draft. we'll see how this all shakes out in the years to come, but at least at the moment, i am super hopeful"
"yeah rockets seemed to be very disenchanted with the college players in this draft, only took josh christopher at 24"
All-time it's probably Josh Christopher Paul George Karl Malone
"Tbf the rest of our squad looked pretty incompetent compared to Sengun, Josh Christopher and Kj Martin."
"Sengun is a freakin beast. He moves fluidly, has a safe dribble, a nice bag of post moves, and rebounds well. He knows where he needs to be on defense and when he can assert himself on offense. Also, he didn't do it much, but he can def shoot the 3 (that logo shot though).   He should be a backup 4 or 5 day 1 and will play plenty of minutes with only Wood and Theis in front of him. I wonder if he might even be starting by the end of the season.  Josh Christopher will make a great sixth man some time down the road. I think we'll have to see if he'll be a career starting caliber player, but his skillset of tenacious defense and decent offensive will be great for contending rosters to have.  Don't think I need to say anything about Green. He was fantastic.  Garuba was invisible though. /s"
"Meh, maybe that is the best thing in Summer League, but in NBA, you need multiple playmakers.  Also, Josh Christopher is a heck of a defender."
Josh Christopher is the other sleeper man this dude is just go mode for 48 mins
"Oh yes Josh Christopher who we drafted as a defensive specialist, right"
Josh Christopher gotta be played by some dude with a ps4 controller
Josh Christopher had 7 assists?!!  Does not look like it
Sengun and Josh Christopher looking like Kobe and Gasol
Josh Christopher is a menance on D  Getting Marcus smart vibes
At this point josh Christopher &gt; Cade
And especially on Clutchfans. I can already see the “I have grown to hate Josh Christopher” threads 😂
"How Josh Christopher develops defensively will be important. I don't think he'll ever be consistent on offense (though he will have nights where he can't miss). But on defense, he has potential to be consistently lethal."
Is Josh Christopher the greatest two first names player of all time?
Josh Christopher got the Black AF1s on lmao
I can already see the Josh Christopher praise/hate threads in a couple years after every game on r/rockets
Why would he? He had a free lane to the basket. People talk like Josh Christopher is just supposed to feed the ball to Green and Sengun when he isn't even a PG.
Josh Christopher is pretty much Eric Gordon
Pistons so locked in on Green  They forget we still have two HOF players in Sengun and Josh Christopher
Josh Christopher don't give a fuck if he gets the ball he's shooting it. You have to respect the unrelenting chucker in an era when most players are moving away from that style of play.
"Rockets really got  Sengun, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba and some guy named Jalen Green"
Lebron was right about Josh Christopher
Josh Christopher is beefy Von Wafer w/defensive talent. He's gonna drive me crazy at times but I love him already lol
Josh Christopher is a NUT lol
the NBA draft was apparently  1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green  2.5. Josh Christopher
Josh Christopher doesn’t pass but for good reason
man josh christopher is actually allergic to passing lmao
Josh Christopher is THAT GUY
Josh “J.R. Smith” Christopher
Josh Christopher?
Josh Christopher is so talented man. If he can get his shot selection under control he's gonna make a lot of money
That’s are other first round pick Josh Christopher.
AAU basketball really hurts these players during team basketball. See: Josh Christopher
I’ve watched Josh Christopher in 1 and a quarter games and I hate watching him already lmao
"ok doris, just don't give josh christopher credit for that steal.."
Josh Christopher has my condolences for when he faces curry for the first time
josh christopher demands a trade to the pelicans
Josh Christopher should focus on learning to pass the ball
Only four years away from the Luka Garza/Josh Christopher showdown.
At this point Josh Christopher &gt; Cade
Josh Christopher needs to improve on the shot selection but he has really active hands on defense which is nice to see
"Bro Houston absolutely killed this draft! Green already looks like a 20+ PPG guy with playmaking ability, Sengun looks like baby Jokic, and I like what I've seen out of Josh Christopher too."
Josh Christopher has the game of a good 6th man. Instant offense off the Bench who can create his own shot.
Josh Christopher the next Josh Smith.
josh christopher experience hilarious
I could see Josh Christopher becoming a Jordan Clarkson guy. Instant offense off the bench
Josh Christopher has a lot of defensive potential. He's got pest energy which is crazy because he has the tools to be a great scorer as well.
Josh Christopher actually thinks he's the 2nd overall pick.
"Josh Christopher gives me Eric Gordon vibes, just wish he could shot as good as him"
The new one is likely gonna be Jalen Green and Josh Christopher playing in AAU.
"Idk why ur getting downvoted, Josh Christopher literally measured at 6’3 without shoes at the combine a month ago. Matt Hurt measured at 6’8.5 so that ones correct. Summer league heights are notorious for being wrong"
"Jalen Green, KJ Martin, and Josh Christopher are going to be so fun to watch"
I don't think it's just that. Many nba top prospects are highly regarded growing up. Josh Christopher and Lamelo are two high school social media stars but their dedication and passion for the game are unquestionable.
"Wall, Green, KPJ, Theis and Wood as their starting 5.  Picked up gems in Sengun, Garuba and Josh Christopher.  Promising talent in Kenyon Martin Jr, Jae-Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks to name a few.  Houston's rebuilding better than teams that have been ""rebuilding"" for more than 3 seasons LOL"
"I loved their draft.  I’m not as high on Sengun watching some clips from him, but they are going to be a good young fun team to watch.  I really liked the josh Christopher pick that late.  Everyone says he can play.    Now what happens with wall and Gordon? You need good vets, but those guys still wanna compete and you don’t want them having a bad attitude affecting the young guys early.  They know the game, they know it’s not their team anymore, so you kind of gotta get rid of them quick or know that they are there to mentor guys - wall for sure does not think that he is in that part of his career.  He’s still on the redemption path."
"I remember having a MyLeague team with him, Josh Christopher, and Jahvon Quinerly. Absolute studs."
"Aside from Primo, Josh Christopher is up there especially with Cam Thomas on the board"
I honestly think Jalen green and josh Christopher are gonna pan out really well for Houston. I can see Garuba surprising people as well.
Don't forget about Josh Christopher
"I honestly don't see how Jalen and Usman fail. They have specific roles that they do very well, imo they are sure things.   I'm high on Sengun, but will admit he has issues that could make him a bust. I'm not high on Josh Christopher at all, scoring wing who isn't an elite scorer. The goal should be to turn him into a defender because he has potential with his frame."
"Rockets  I think we won this draft man  Green, Sengun and Garuba is truly amazing  Josh Christopher is someone I need to watch tape on tommorow  Hawks, Warriors, Orlando, Hornets and Pistons did good too"
"Only pick I dislike is Josh Christopher, and I really dislike it compared to who else was available at the time"
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
Kpj/Jalen green/josh Christopher gonna combine for 55ppg &amp; 3 assists per night and I will love every single second of it
oh shit Jalen Green and Josh Christopher both got drafted by houston they’re really good friends
Wasn’t josh Christopher kinda not that good in college?
Josh Christopher and Jalen Green reuniting that’s sick. Were so fun together in AAU
Josh Christopher Paul George kHILLian Hayes
Jalen Green and Josh Christopher 😳
Josh Christopher is a steal at 24
"probably picking the most obvious team here, but:  KPJ  Jalen Green  Jae'Sean Tate  Christian Wood  Alperen Sengun  Off the Bench: Eric Gordon, KMJ, Nwaba, Theis, Josh Christopher, Gerald Green  Bold of me to only use one superstar: Gerald Green"
"Eric Gordon is also in the guard rotation, as are young players like Armani Brooks and Josh Christopher. Why should the Rockets be forced to play Wall over guys they want to be part of the future?"
"He deserves to play over Josh Christopher because he makes more money than him..?  Cause for the rockets it makes way more sense to develop a rookie who might turn in to a contributor than to play Wall who’s past his prime and doesn’t fit the rockets time line at all.  Also by your logic, Christopher also has an NBA contract and shouldn’t be benched because he, as you said, “isn’t retired”."
Yet he's better than Josh Christopher and deserves to play over him lol
"For sure.  Their young core is way underrated. KJ Martin is an insane athlete who became a legit shooter as his rookie year went on. Josh Christopher even has some good 3&amp;D potential, too.  But that is the team of the future (hopefully, if ayer development goes as planned)... Not the present."
"I’ll cast my vote for the Rockets, if we’re counting the draft. A team that was incredibly awful last year, setting one of the longest losing streaks in league history, re-tooled with four supremely exciting rookies in Jalen Green, Alpheren Sengun, Josh Christopher, and Usman Garuba. Considering how the Rockets were the league’s most moribund team after the Harden trade, with a core of Kelly Olynyk and washed Wall, to have one of the league’s best young cores (those four + KPJ + Tate) less than a year later actually gives Rockets fans some hope for the future."
Josh Christopher is the next Kawhi sadly
"They don’t only do that for the second round, look at Houston this year for example. [Houston acquired the 24th pick and got Josh Christopher with it](https://youtu.be/vHt3caPl-04)  The actual verbiage of the Luka trade is this;  Atlanta receives *The draft rights* to Trae Young and a 2019 protected FRP  Dallas receives *The draft rights* to Luka Doncic  Id say “draft rights” is closer to being a player than a pick but it’s all semantics"
"I made a 2021 draft class for NBA 2k21 at the beginning of last season when Boston was still projected top 10. I adjusted the draft class over the course of the year as guys rose and fell (like dropping Ziaire, boosting Sengun) but I didn't touch Boston, because that year for Kentucky was just weird and I'm not buying that it means anything.  Among non-Kentuckians I also didn't dock Josh Christopher or Jalen Johnson either. Them slipping felt like noise to me."
Josh Christopher Kevin Porter Jr Jalen Green
"Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Josh Christopher"
"Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, Alperen SengÜn, Usman Garuba, and one of the forwards from the top-10 picks of the 2022 NBA draft."
Josh Christopher*
Shout out Josh Christopher being a good hype man
This game needs more Josh Christopher
Silas needs to give Josh Christopher some minutes. He cannot possibly play worse than DJ Augustin is right now
PG - KPJ/Augustin  SG - Jalen/Gordon  SF - Tate/House  PF - Wood/KMJ  C - Theis/Sengun  Later in the season if Gordon/House are gone you'll probably see some Nawba/Brooks/Josh Christopher but Josh and Usman will probably be in the G-League for most of the season
"Name a single draft where a team got that many you g dudes with this much upside. Two of these guys were studs over seas, one of which was an MVP of one of the best international leagues at just 18 years old(ring any bells?), and two other guys in Jalen Green and Josh Christopher who are both look like fantastic picks from all of the information and tape we do have on them.  It’s not outlandish to think this could be one of the best drafts by a team, if not the best. Hell, I’d say it’s one if the most impressive jobs by a GM in a two year span if you look at the young talent they’ve acquired over the past two seasons."
Eh I like these takes because it’ll be interesting to look back in. Personally I’m not a believer in Josh Christopher but if he works out this really will be an insane draft class
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen
 Trade Gordon/House so Josh Christopher and KJ Martin can get more minutes
I mean if I knew back then that the trade was  James Harden for:  3 FRP's  4 pick swaps  Kevin Porter Jr (Came from the Prince in cleveland debacle)  Jalen Green  Josh Christopher  2022 Miami pick swap  &amp;#x200B;  I would've been really really happy actually
The more I see Josh Christopher play the more I love him
Josh Christopher has some mean potential
"Josh Christopher is fearless, reminded me of Draymond out there, directing the offense late in the game"
KPJ was great   But Josh Christopher and Sengun really impressed me  This season will be the most fun Rockets season since 17-18
"well, *personally* i was NEVER sold on Ben Simmons the way everyone else was. i didn't think he'd end up like this, but it didn't rub me the right way when Brett Brown was at a press conference begging Simmons to at least try to shoot the ball, and he still didn't.  obviously hindsight is 20/20, but from that day on i've been more critical of him, so when his name kept coming up, i wasn't exactly excited. between Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, and Alpern, i'm already happy with the haul we got.  although, im not sure if that's something that happened because of, or in spite of Fertitta."
This kid is talented for real. His passing looked pretty good too in the summer league. I was hoping the rockets grabbed him but josh christopher is nice as well.
"Love Josh Christopher screaming ""get the ball"". Fuckin adorable how pumped he was"
Lol. Josh Christopher was so hyped.
"Our G league boys are looking pretty decent. I’m not expecting either to be a star, but Garuba and Josh Christopher could both carve out unique respective roles in this league. Jalen and Sengun really need to take the offseason serious and work on their bodies and man the future is bright."
Josh Christopher is not a PG my guy. Did you not watch the summer league? He’s a SG with playmaking as a swing skill set that still has a long way to go
"It’s not about the wins. It’s about how are players are being used   Our young players have struggled getting minutes over random vets. We LITERALLY have no offensive sets. It’s all just do whatever you want out there. Which for guys like KPJ and Green is too much responsibility right now and they are playing awful because of it   Garuba who played in a top league in the world and paid 4m just to break his team’s contract to come here can’t even step on the court without us being down 20 points. He’s now playing great in the g league  We have the worst shooting team in the league by a mile and Armoni Brooks who is a certified sniper can’t get on the court either.   Josh Christopher our other first rounder has struggled to get on the court as well. Despite being a better passer and shot creator than most of our team.   KJ Martin just recently started getting minutes despite outplaying our entire roster.  Sengun was given 5 min a couple games ago cause Quote by Silas “Theis was playing well”  Silas is not just not winning us games. He isn’t prioritizing minutes for our young guys, nor is he setting up our players for success.   So you tell me, what is Silas actually doing well? Except for having a big old grin"
We don’t have much but… 1. Alperen Sengun 2. Jalen Green 3. Kevin Porter Jr. 4. Christian Wood 5. Josh Christopher 6. Usman Garuba 7. Kenyon Martin Jr. 8. Jae’sean Tate
I was wishing I could throw things through my tv at Silas's face because he is so infuriating.   Sengun aside. Why is House getting a single minute if Josh Christopher or KJ Martin is healthy? We are playing this Mathews guy 20 minutes a game on a two-way as opposed to our first round pick in Christopher.  Not that I think Mathews is bad but my point still stands.
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
No clue why House/Augustine/Theis/Gordon get minutes over Sengun/Brooks/ especially Josh Christopher. Silas rotations are blah.
Josh Christopher needs minutes man
Sengun looking good and Josh Christopher and Garuba are not even getting any minutes.
"I appreciate your comment bro. Just the fact that one person read the post validates the time I put lmao. I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to watch our games, I'm barely hanging on.  As for our rookies. None of us can even say how good Usman Garuba (23rd pick) or Josh Christopher (24th) are. They play 7 and 6 minutes a game respectively. We seem to be developing Theis, Nwaba, and House instead lmao.  Honestly I can't even take the starting lineup seriously so it's hard to give an opinion of Jalen. I'm not just saying that either, I'm pretty critical of the team, but there's just no opportunities for him to show consistency when they struggle to even bring the ball up the court. I'd compare it to when Booker averaged 14 his rookie year. You see their game, you see the potential, but it's nearly impossible for a rookie to thrive in that situation unless you're Bron or Luka. Really all we can mention are his flashes, reserving judgement for now.  Sengun is surprising. His offensive game is translating really well. He's already an offensive option that the team can dump the ball to in the post, or even at the perimeter, and you can expect him to create a decent look. Definitely our most consistent creator and playmaker, which is pretty sad. He's going to need to improve defensively though. The rookie whistle isn't helping and fouls are what's limiting his playing time. I'm cool with him coming off the bench though, let's him show out against lesser talent and develop go-to moves. We also need to figure out in the next few years whether he's a 4 or 5, but gotta see how he fills out."
"this rockets season makes me feel like the people complaining so much either don't watch or understand what is really happening or don't understand reality.  i was very critical of silas last season. and everything i was critical about he dramatically improved on. and is still going to keep getting better the longer he is a head coach. this is his second season as a head coach EVER.  silas is also developing a team with a core of guys who have mostly played less than three or four seasons worth of games in the nba. and trying to develop and integrate FOUR ROOKIES. and still develop players from the season before.  everyone wants things to be fast and immediately happen, but that is impossible. no matter who the coach is they aren't going to play 4 rookies, play them all 30+ minutes a night, and win games right away.  silas has proven he is solid enough with the offensive stuff that it isn't a long term issue. right now he is most focused on developing kpj green and sengun, and has started integrating josh christopher.   kpj is starting to play cleaner, so silas immediately started giving green more time running the offense on a lineup for him. sengun already had a lineup specially for him. now that green is taking his turn sengun has been placed with green more and house has taken augustine's minutes. improving the defense and giving the rookies more control.  the defensive improvement was especially impressive, there are still a lot of things for them to work on but there is a lot more progress than too many fans are acting like.  silas should be there at least until they reach the 3 year window they originally set up for development. and by then i hope silas shows everyone he should be their coach for the long term. because silas is getting a lot of hate for not rushing things, he is doing everything people want but just at a more reasonable pace."
"Josh Christopher looks more patient on offense tbh and he’s much better on defense than KPJ.  I think he can play PG better than KPJ down the line, if given the reps and proper development"
eyy josh christopher actually looks like he could be a decent player.
Ayy that's future mvp and hall of fame Josh Christopher
"I mean, it was the Bucks pick. I’m pretty sure it turned into Josh Christopher or someone sorta forgettable like that."
His teammate Josh Christopher used to do this thing in high school where he stuffed the lower parts of the short into his compression underwear and it looked like he was wearing a diaper.
Josh Christopher sighting
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
"yeah but you can't teach that kind of explosiveness and athleticism. I agree.i think KPJ is more of a SG, but you guys are at the stage where you are just developing young talent. if KPJ turns into a 18 ppg microwave type guy like Jordan Clarkson, and Jalen Green can work on his shot selection and start scoring at the level hes capable of, with Woof &amp; Sengun, i would take that core as a top 10 young core in the league. I also like Garuba and Josh Christopher"
Josh Christopher is so fucking good.  Dude had YG show up to his games in high school and he balled out. Raw as fuck though.
