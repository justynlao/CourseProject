Mychal Mulder
Bench Oubre and bring back Mychal Mulder
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"
"I know, right? Why hasn't Mychal Mulder been put in yet? No point in even watching"
Mychal Mulder looks like a lankier version of Steph Curry
"Hilarious moment last night where Steph didn't pick up Draymond man when he left to help and the miscommunication allowed an open layup.  Draymond turned around furious already yelling, and realized it was Steph who made the mistake and kept turning trying to play it off like he was yelling at Mychal Mulder. 😂"
Mychal Mulder locked him up in 2nd half LMAO!
Mychal Mulder FUCKING PLUS 32 MY GUY WALMART KLAY
Mychal Mulder with the +29 lol.
"Mychal mulder, 26 we got him specifically for that.  I want him to work with dray on on-ball defense cus oubre should be out of the fucking starting  lineup"
"Bc guys like Alen Smailagic, Toscano Andersona and mychal mulder are better than him"
"These first 10-15 or so games are basically summer league, training camp, and preseason for a team returning only two other players with substantial experience playing with Steph (Draymond, Looney). Every win in this beginning stretch, even against supposedly ""bad"" teams, are going to be huge as this team figures itself out throughout the season. These ""bad"" defensive teams are when the Warriors and Kerr will have the luxury to tinker and experiment.  I see this season as a ""luxury"" rebuild year. We'll likely have two first-round picks next year to add to a developing young talent in Wiseman. Other young players will build valuable experience playing with Steph and Draymond as they age into the twilight of their careers, and we'll be able to evaluate them before we ease Klay back in hopefully next year. The ""luxury"" bit comes with the fact that we have very a real chance to make the playoffs while still being able to add strong talent near the top of the draft next year.  Some of my takeaways of the roster so far from 7 games:  * Steph is still Steph. He usually starts the season cold and heats up around the ASB, but he will be pressed early and often this year. Prayers up for his health, I still cringe every time he drives into traffic trying to do it all for this team's offense. * Draymond still contributes in so many ways outside of the box score. Offensively you already see his impact as Steph's partner in the PnR and with the dimes. Our defense is worlds better with him in there barking and directing traffic. I don't know what else he can do to show he can be a floor-raiser on the defensive end.  * Wiseman still looks lost out there but him just being on the floor impacts the game. He's only going to get better throughout the year as he develops chemistry and adjusts to the speed of the NBA game. * Wiggins is performing exactly to my expectations so far this year and still has room to grow. Again, we'll have to hold our breaths here for sustained effort, but we've now got a 19 game sample size of Warriors Wiggins (12 games last year) where he's averaged 18.7p/4.9r/3.1a/1.0s/1.4b on splits of .438/.359/.685 and he's not taking any of Steph's minutes or touches at PG. Still got that MIN first rounder coming next year too... * Kelly, you pretty motherfucker. His shot will regress back to the mean eventually, but he sure does love driving into traffic to throw up bad shots. Good effort, and we may be able to retain him past this year on a reasonable contract with his Bird Rights. * With Chriss' unfortunate injury, Paschall has been thrust into minutes as a bench small-ball C which has completely opened up his offensive game. I'm seeing shades of the Carl Landry/Mo Speights/David West role for him moving forward * Looney's experience playing with Steph helps him stay on the floor against other bench Cs and he finally looks valuable again. His experience in the playoffs shows in his defensive effort against penetration. So glad we don't have to start him anymore, though. * Damion Lee has won me over. I think he can be a solid last man on the bench on any team in the league with his shooting ability, and has shown some real swagger lately with clutch shooting. I can't be upset with him playing 10-15 minutes per game if needed. * Mychal Mulder, my goodness. The man can catch-and-shoot off screens just like Steph and Klay. He's going to see a lot more minutes and trust from Kerr moving forward. * Chriss' injury has also opened up a spot for Juan Toscano-Anderson. I'm not really sure what position he plays to be honest, but I like what I've seen from him in his limited time. Not to conjure up more ""Andre 2.0"" memes, but I love the confident way he brings the ball up on breaks like Andre used to, which opened up Steph/Klay corner threes on the break. Defensively he's got good energy and decent hands. * Bazemore's energy is great and will be a good veteran piece backing up the wing spots. * Wannamaker has been good in his role, no complaints. Just a steady hand at backup PG. * Poole still doesn't look ready with the ball in his hands, but I've seen him do a lot of good things with the ball despite the shaky handle and decision-making. He's a wild card and still needs development time, but I can still see the potential for a backup combo guard."
"He averaged 12 points per game last year on 53% true shooting playing 23 minutes, that's certainly not *awful,* but undersized score first guards who can give you mediocre scoring and no defense are a dime a dozen in the G-League, and most of them are like 5 years younger than IT.   He definitely has the talent to be an end of the rotation guy in the league but at his age it's just not worth it for most teams to give him a roster spot over a comparably talented ~25 year old who you can at least hope will round out their game a bit more with NBA experience. Like for the Warriors right now, if it was between IT and Mychal Mulder for our 15th roster spot I'm taking Mulder without hesitation."
1. Mychal Mulder 2. Juan Toscano Anderson 3. Brad Wannamaker 4. Jordan Poole 5. Damion Lee 6. Alan Smailagic 7. Nico Manion
"Hey, I watched the box score multiple times during the game and can say that this Draymond kid had a nice plus/minus and a+.600 ts% clearly a factor in this game.   Obviously he's no Mychal Mulder, but, he's clearly contributing a lot."
"IDK if you watch basketball in 2021, but Kelly Oubre has been very limited (might be starting to improve, but until tonight he was on the all-time historical worst shooting start ever), James Wiseman had played 3 basketball games since college, and the Warriors are giving real minutes to Kent Bazemore, Brad Wanamaker and Mychal Mulder."
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
"C'mon guys, now that you see how fun Steph is, can't you just cut us a break?  Seriously those, we have one Future Stars Mychal Mulder available"
If thats all it takes shoulda had Mychal Mulder compete. He's got a 42 inch vert
"I can't believe Mychal Mulder made it lol, what a legend"
I didn't know anyone besides Warriors fans knew who Mychal Mulder was or had seen him play lol
that is until Zeller goes for 50 and Mychal Mulder hits 9 threes
bro i don’t come here to watch mychal mulder tf 😭😭
I wonder if Mychal Mulder is related to Klay's dad.
"Nah bruh, yall got jordan poole and mychal mulder... but i guess if you throw us curry and cash considerations we could work it out"
"Mychal Mulder. Remember the name, cause I can see this guy doing damage from the arc over the next couple of years."
"I’m sure if the warriors felt he was better than Mychal Mulder, he’d be on the team."
"You're really out here acting like a team giving heavy minutes to Brad Wanamaker, Mychal Mulder, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano Anderson (who is great but he's 6 months removed from the g-league) is the same as those Houston teams."
"Oladipo literally immediately turned into an All Star the moment he got away from Westbrook's ball dominant offense and Sabonis got a lot better too.   Steph would take either of those two over Juan Tascno Anderson, Kelly Oubre, Brad Wanamaker, Damion Lee , Mychal Mulder.   Oh yah and we haven't had a single center for 6 games, so yah I'd take Steven Adams right now, who was a far better offensive player on that team then any of our currently centers even when healthy. (yah yah yah I know Wiseman has more potential than Adams but he is so young and inexperience understandably that he hasn't been a good offensive player this year)."
"First time watching a warriors game live, who is this Mychal Mulder fellow. He seems like a decent role player"
"They got 15 wins with Juan Toscano Anderson, Jordan Poole, Marquese Chriss, Mychal Mulder, and Omari Spellman..."
"How good would a team.made up of just Canadians do?  Murray, Dort, Boucher, Birch, Wiggins, TT, Olynyk, Shai, RJ, Dillon Brooks,Brazdeikis,  Brandon Clarke, Nate Darling, CoJo, Powell, Mychal Mulder, NAW?"
"You’re telling me Damion Lee, Juan Toscano Anderson, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, and Jordan Poole would all get minutes on other teams when we picked up half of them up from the G League?"
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
"Well you have to factor in the whole season. And Russ' lack of efficiency.  Also, advanced stats are harmed by colinearity - ie, if a bad player plays all their minutes next to great players on a great team there will be an effect on their advanced stats. And vice versa for a good player surrounded by terrible ones.  For example, Donte Divincenzo was rated at around a top 5 player in the league in RPM at one point last year due to playing next to Giannis so much. He was a great role player, but if he was on the TWolves he wouldn't have ranked so highly.  This year, Mychal Mulder is 18th in the league in RPM (Warriors). Obviously not a top 20 player though lol. Interestingly, Russ is actually 14th in RPM right now. But the same principle applies for other stats."
"Yes, considering his stats and game impact were doing fairly well right before he got injured, and regardless of his stats we have Mychal Mulder playing meaningful minutes. Oubre is at the very least better than Mulder so not having Oubre is indeed bad for us."
"&gt; I'd give the series 60-40 to Warriors with both teams at full strength. Being down two starters is pretty significant. Let's reverse the roles with 2015 Warriors missing Iggy while HOU had Bev+Monti - does that series go past 5/6 in favor of the Rockets?  I’d say Warriors had enough depth for that even in 2015, especially since Monti would be the same or a worse liability on D Terrence Jones or Josh Smith were.  &gt; So what? OKC was a perennial WCF powerhouse that was out of the playoff picture due to injures. 2021 Lakers would love to have the Clippers not be in the playoffs with injuries to Paul George and Kawhi, and for two of Kyrie/KD/Harden be out in a potential finals. But not every run is as easy as 2015.  OKC being a perennial powerhouse in prior years still doesn’t mean they were as good as their 2016 version though. And the 2020 Lakers played an injured Lillard, Westbrook, Bam, and Dragic on their way to a ring. You don’t have to be out to say your injured. It’s not as bad as 2015, but no one puts asterisks on rings because rings are still rings. There are no ‘easy’ runs to rings.   &gt; There is a double-standard regarding takes on Curry's impact - that Curry elevates teams with KD/Klay but is absolved of any shortcomings without them.  What shortcomings do you talk about?  &gt; Curry mutually benefits from Klay/KD, but his fans act like gravity is a one-way street. Now that Klay/KD are not on the team, Curry has a chance to substantiate those absurd gravity claims, but is only scraping by as an 8-seed.  What did you expect the Warriors to be this season? Apart from Dray and Looney, he’s playing with newcomers, a G League cast, and rookies. Expecting them to be a top 4 seed is absurd. Even guys like Kobe wouldn’t drag this team to higher levels. We’ve seen his absolute peak drag a Lakers team as shitty as this one to a 7 seed and that was his absolute max.   &gt; You might say Curry's supporting cast isn't that great. I'm saying it's not as bad as people are describing.   +/- metrics would definitely disagree with you. So would the spacing metrics.  &gt; You might then say Klay will return. I'd then say a rehabbing Klay at 80% of himself isn't going to move the needle toward championship status. So given all this, Curry has a chance the next few years to prove he doesn't need KD. I'm saying he won't even get close to a title.  So basically, you expect the Warriors with one All NBA player in Steph, MAYBE enother one in Klay, and a declining Dray who’s not All NBA anymore, to prove themselves AFTER winning 3 rings? I call bullshit. How often to teams win without at least 2 All NBA caliber guys? There’s Mavs 2011, Spurs 2014, and Pistons 2004 off the top of ny head. That’s 3 teams since the start of 2000, and those were excellently constructed teams. What is with this extremely high bar?  &gt; I already explained why 2015 was another anomaly   Nope, you’re putting asterisks on titles, again. You want to give KD props for his rings, then yes I agree. But keep that same energy. You can’t just call a whole ass championship run an anomaly. There are so many factors that go on a championship run other than just the playoffs? Have you ever thought that maybe being good in the reg. season led to fresh legs for the Warriors in the playoffs? And that decreased their chances of getting injured? Sure their opponents getting injured was unfortunate, but calling their ring anything an anomaly is like saying KD’s rings don’t mean shit. And the thing is, they do.  &gt; Can Curry remain relevant without a stacked team? I'm saying no.  Man was relevant before KD came and relevant is relative. Do you mean relevant by contenders, or by being playoff teams? Because to do that you have to analyze what teams they’re gonna be on. I’m not gonna sit here and think that a team that gives significant minutes to Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee should win a ring. But I’d be shocked if a team with Steph, Klay, and Dray don’t make the playoffs."
Right below garbage time Mychal Mulder
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
And mychal mulder
Mychal Mulder is the real King of the fourth quarter ! (only in garbage time lol).  Smailagic is a waste of a roster spot. Guy is just not there.
I watched it. Mychal Mulder can really shoot the ball!
Trash time legend: Mychal Mulder
"Mychal Mulder, Wiseman, Damion Lee"
"Shooters usually have bad nights/stretches. I figured he wouldn't be as cold tonight as compared to yesterday (although I did not expect him to catch fire and match his career high). I was hoping it would take him another game or two to get out of his funk, but I guess Dray talking shit to him lit a fire under him because he was much more aggressive, and an aggressive Lonzo is a much better player.  The only thing that was consistent was BI wasn't much of a factor in both games, although tonight he went out for some reason (injury, illness?) and didn't come back.   A lot of the more reasonable Warriors fans were expecting a split in this b2b because of how shorthanded we've been for the last few weeks. We've been playing an 8 man rotation without Kelly Oubre for most games (and when he was in, he was playing w/ a torn ligament and broken palm), which is why you had people asking ""who is Mychal Mulder"". I was surprised we managed to keep it close in the 2nd game... Wiggins really stepped up these last few games."
"Fuck no if they matched up with Steph he will beat them. And knowing the Lakers, someone like Mychal Mulder or Kelly Oubre will turn into Reggie Miller against them"
GOAT garbage time shooter Mychal Mulder
"No independent impact on offense, yeah I agree to an extent. He’s a great passer, but yes, his offense is very dependent on Steph and others.  Defensively though, he more than makes up for his bad offense.  Dray isn’t the problem overall (though his lack of offense IS a problem, it’s far from our worst). Our biggest problem is that no team that wants to go anywhere can have Damion Lee or Mychal Mulder playing 20 minutes a night for them and closing games for them.  We need Klay back, and we may even need to make a big trade if we are ever going to attract competitive vets again, so we can relegate guys like Lee or even Poole to low tier bench roles instead of the first guys out there."
The average LA fitness hooper would’ve come closer to making those 2 wide open clutch threes than Mychal Mulder did.
"its to be expected when we have mychal mulder playing, starting AND closing an actual NBA game when he shouldn't even be in the league"
"Steve Kerr is a mind bogglingly bad in game coach at times.  Late in the game the Warriors were getting absolutely killed by offensive rebounds, and the Minnesota shooters were getting open looks because they had to double Towns.  JTA was getting worked in the post so what does Kerr do?!  He brings in MYCHAL MULDER, who is atrocious on defense, who proceeds to get cooked and then airballed two butt naked absolutely wide open threes.  So unbelievably stupid. And in true Kerr fashion the crunch time offense barely featured Curry.  How the fuck am I, an amateur who doesn't know fuck all about the sport, seeing this and Kerr doesn't."
well i'm adam silver and just cause you posted this im gonna go and give it to mychal mulder
"That's how its been. Our top 4 guys are all good (Steph, Dray, Wiggins, Loon) then our bench is just the hottest garbage ever, and we keep losing guys to make it even worse. We are starting Mychal Mulder so Oubre can come off the bench and post a -41 in 23 minutes"
"Dude it doesnt matter if Luka is elite when you start Mychal Mulder, a 3 and D player whi cant shoot 3s or play defense"
Luka is elite but it doesn't matter bro we're starting fucking Mychal Mulder
Don’t disrespect my man Mychal Mulder.   26/5/0 on 62.5/54.5/(0 FTA).
bro we're starting mychal fucking mulder
Idk the other day both Ryan Ruocco and Richard Jefferson thought Mychal Mulder was Steph at different points of the game
"I mean CJ has played 35 games and Nurk 25. Like Klay literally hasn’t played in 2 years and the Warriors have used starting rotations including Kent Bazemore, Juan Tuscano Anderson, Jordan Poole, and fucking Mychal Mulder lol"
"I'm fairly certain that even if the Warriors had the #1 defense in the league A LOT of folks would just assume it was in spite of Steph.  Like, god damn, they aren't a top 10 defense because of Mychal Mulder and Kent Bazemore, FFS."
"Warriors started Mychal Mulder because the preferred choices of Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore were out.   Lol, okay."
"&gt;a very good warriors team   Come on dude. If this was a very good warriors team Jokic would not be winning MVP. Outside of Steph, this is a terrible Warriors team. We played 8 dudes, and started Mychal fucking Mulder."
We had 8 guys. Mulder started tonight... Mychal Mulder
Mychal Mulder is a Steph Curry clone who can dunk
"Mychal Mulder, Dunk Machine"
Mychal Mulder popped off
Anyone who thinks GS would be legit better without Wiggins is straight up braindead.  You really think the Warriors would be better this season if they were playing Kent fucking Bazemore for 33 minutes per game against starting quality NBA wings?  We've seen Wiggins straight up clamp guys like Kawhi this year.  How much money would you bet on Bazemore or Mychal Mulder locking them up?
"I don’t know how any Warriors fan could watch Mychal Mulder in the play-in tourney, and not desperately miss Damion Lee."
"Yeah, we’re probably going to sit him out until the end of this current calendar year to give him a 13~14 month timeline to return. But at the same time Klay’s shooting ability is something that should’ve been kept so I don’t think he’s going to look terribly bad. He’s always been a slow starter so we’ll have to wait a bit longer after his return to fully see how he’s recovered.  And besides, the only thing he needs to do for the Warriors to improve is to be better than Kent Bazemore and Mychal Mulder, which is not a tall task."
"Giannis to the Warriors for Mychal Mulder and a second round pick, rest of the team disbands"
Garbage time sniper Mychal Mulder energy
I can offer Mychal Mulder and a 2nd
The Mychal Mulder special
mychal mulder has entered the chat
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"I don't think [Myers](https://theathletic.com/2610671/2021/05/24/bob-myers-on-the-warriors-offseason-veteran-help-needed-no-plan-to-trade-james-wiseman/) would disagree.  &gt; But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up. &gt;  &gt; “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”"
"Better than the Warriors.  We really have GLeague players playing in the play in. JTA and Mychal fucking Mulder.   Then the rest of the bench? Smailagic, Jordan bell, etc, fuckin bums"
Ikr what a stupid post by him... Watching Mychal Mulder brick 3s all season was not fun at all. Personally I am having a lot more fun watching Julius Randle shoot 3-15 and helping the Knicks get absolutely dicked by Ice Trae in their first playoff appearance in nearly a decade.
"Mychal Mulder, who's making a similar amount, is already 26. I thought the FO and the vets on the team were saying more vets next year. Austin's only 2 years older than Mulder and has way more NBA experience (9 years vs 2) and playoffs experience (9 playoffs series experience vs 2 play-in games experience). Although Rivers' commanding salary might go up based on how Nuggets do this post season.   Honestly, I'd prefer Rivers to Mulder on that bench."
That's called a Mychal Mulder.
Mychal Mulder better be an N/A real soon lol
Mychal Mulder is the one true garbage time god
7. Garbage Time Mychal Mulder
Crowder out here looking like Mychal Mulder
&gt; Mychal Mulder  TIL
No Mychal Mulder from GSW?
The garbage time MVP Mychal Mulder
This guy out here saying Klay isn't six wins better than Mychal Mulder lol.
This guy out here saying Klay isn't six wins better than Mychal Mulder lol.
"Yup. If Mychal Mulder was not going to play much, why not play Damion Lee or Gary Payton II a spell?"
Happened a few times this season with Mychal Mulder too.
"Mychal Mulder finishes -14 for the Warriors in 8 minutes of play, lol."
They were in the play in with Mychal Mulder  minutes
btw should out mychal mulder with -14 in 8 mins and bazemore 1-5 on threes! thought he was money in that corner
Is there a more unclutch shooter than Mychal Mulder lmao
"I'm not sure Steph had/has worse teammate but in what was treated as a playoff game, the Warriors played Mychal Mulder for a significant stretch of time."
"Absolutely. This is my biggest gripe with the Warriors taking Wiseman over someone like Williams, Ball, or Haliburton.   Many have argued it was really a fit pick, but it really wasn’t. It was so they had a body to throw out there for 25+ minutes at center until the minutes started mattering.   Even if you’re not playing the long game, at least some of the other guys would have been able to make an immediate impact in close games over Kent Bazemore or Mychal Mulder."
"I think he did, CJ is way better offensively than anything Steph has to work with, there’s been multiple posts about how Wiseman was the worst player in the league and he played major minutes during the season, even last game without Oubre they played Mychal Mulder for 20+ minutes in a must-win game lol. This Warriors team is awful and wouldn’t have been close to the play-in without Steph."
"Kerr really put Mychal ""I only hit shots when the games over"" Mulder in the game before Jordan Poole"
You know it's our goat shooter : Mychal Mulder.
"Love both the stats and the humor.  Inspired by Mychal Mulder consistently turning into Game 6 Klay with the score out of reach: is there a reasonable way to determine the king of garbage time? This would require a definition of garbage time, and then something like points per minute of garbage time, or scoring during garbage time vs out of garbage time."
"below replacement value players that have been through the Warrior's system and been ""serviceable"":  Ian Clark   James Michael McAdoo   Alonzo McKinnie   Damian Jones   Festus Ezeli   Quinn Cook   Patrick McCaw   Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Brandon Rush   Justin Holiday    Others who thrive in the Warriors system that may not look as good somewhere else:  Kevon Looney   Shaun Livingston   Juan T."
"Dray and Wiggins are off limits. But I wouldn't mind taking KCP for Mychal Mulder, Caruso for Gary Payton II, and Zubac for Jordan Bell.  Oubre's kind of a moot point right now since he's out another 7-10 days before reevaluation.... and I think that news was broke Thursday or Friday? I get the feeling dude probably needs to either shut it down or get surgery for the torn wrist ligament and broken palm, but he's holding out until Warriors get eliminated before completely ruling out a return because there appears to be a chance that he can still play without getting surgery or shutting down in a best case scenario."
"If Mychal Mulder scores 10 non-garbage time points, it's over for the Lakers.     No Chance."
Jordan Poole and Mychal Mulder for Steph and Klay
"Wiggins contract is for 2 years so he will be here  next year.     Free agents at the end of the season are  Bazemore (Unrestricted)  Looney (Player Option)  Mannion (Restricted)  Kelly Oubre (Un Restricted)     2022: Steph Curry  Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Eric Paschal (Restricted)   Off course Curry,  may sign an extension this summer.   And trades could happen"
Master Skyfucker is training Poole Boy and Mychal (Jordan) Mulder for greatness
Steph possesses Mychal Mulder in garbage time or non-crunch time minutes. Then he transfers those powers to others.
"The greatest nickname I've ever read for Mulder was Mychal ""Steph 'Klay Thompson' Curry"" Mulder 🤣🤣🤣"
How about Mychal Mulder though?
Mychal Mulder is the greatest basketball player of all time  Prove me wrong
“Mychal Mulder has quit basketball” lol
Technically this whole game is garbage time  Is Mychal Mulder about to drop 50?
"Maybe a hot take but I would have traded Wiggins + a lottery pick for all 3. I don’t think Brooks or Anderson are any worse than Wiggins, and 2 role players &gt; 1 + an additional shooter off the bench who is better than Damian Lee or Mychal Mulder  Feels kinda too late now"

"Oubre is terrible and we were better when he was off the floor, even when we replaced him with g leaguers like Damion Lee and Mychal Mulder. Bazemore is the biggest loss of the offseason imo."
I bet Mychal Mulder has been playing basketball for longer than Wiseman has been alive.
"As a Warriors fan, Mychal Mulder and James Wiseman.  Mulder actually has 3 games with 6 or more 3s, that's pretty good. Problem is he hits those when the pressure is off. It's not a coincidence that all but 3 of his 11 games where he made 3 or more 3s, the game was decided by 20+ points, and that he's a 63.6% free throw shooter despite shooting a respectable 39.7% from 3. He has a good stroke and does take a lot of contested 3s in the corner, which makes his percentages pretty impressive.  Wiseman has huge promise, he's 7-foot-1 with a 7-foot-6 wingspan, with a pretty absurd mobility for a player in his size. He's only 1 of 3 centers to shoot better than 75% from the restricted area (given that they played 40+ games), but the problem is he only shoots 31.3% from anywhere else in the paint which he'll definitely be able to improve by working on his touch. Wiseman was at his best when he killed his mid-range attempts and if the Warriors can start utilizing him as a lot threat more often then he can be big time."
"Going to disagree.  People really underestimate what Curry was doing with the squad he had. Warriors had basically no depth. Took the Lakers with both AD and Lebron in with Kevin Looney and Kent Bazemore in the starting lineup and Wiggins as his 2nd option to a 3pt game in the play ins.  Had Poole, Mychal Mulder, and Juan Toscano-Anderson on rotation. That was it."
&gt;Warriors garbage time lineup will be must-watch.  Especially if Mychal Mulder is out there
"Tbf, the full quote in The Athletic article is:  &gt; My gut reaction is Jordan Poole. But that’s without having seen anybody at camp, that’s without having seen our rookies or Otto Porter, (Mychal) Mulder, Damion Lee with the rest of the group. It could be any of those guys.  So OPJ is still an option"
"but at least it would be steph they're trying to hide, not mychal mulder."
"How dare you declare a false god to own the same title as the true garbage time goat, Mychal Mulder."
"The warriors can get to $6.5 million in salaries with Paschall + 3 player that the Jazz could immediately waive and pay $0 to (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder, Smailagic).  Not sure if the Moody salary can be used as well, or if there's a moratorium on trading him as soon as he signs?"
Yeah I like baze but I’d part with him and dlee for a couple two way contracts if we sign Iggy and Batum. I’m cool with shuffling nico and mychal mulder back-and-forth for the 14th/15th roster spots
Warriors were playing a 7 man rotation and the 7th man was Mychal Mulder during this stretch. There were empty roster spots they could’ve used to get Austin Rivers or basically anyone to help but they decided to do nothing and played a 7-8 man rotation for 20+ games and 3 of those players spent time in the g- league the past 2 seasons.
"&gt; Well now the warriors have to replace 3 of those roster spots with min guys  That’s a positive considering how bad the bench played last year. The Lakers literally built a better bench off the scrap heap  If they weren’t Warriors players, you wouldn’t be defending them. No one gives a shit outside your org about Mychal Mulder and Allen Smailagic and Eric Paschall. None of them get into a playoff rotation like Kyle Anderson does  &gt; Is Lacob supposed to pay $60M for Kyle Anderson  Depends how much he wants to increase his chance at winning a chip"
"“Just the latest to benefit from playing with Steph”, Oubre was on the team last year and his 3 point shot was even worse than his career averages. Draymond hits 3 pointers at a low 20s % clip now. Wiggins clearly put in the work to improve his 3 point shot and deserves credit for that. It’s not like he’s Mychal Mulder or Damion Lee where the defense just isn’t focusing on him and giving him open threes, he was hitting contested/tough ones too last year."
"No, as a warriors' fan, they made the right moves tonight.  Kuminga and Moody was beyond a best case scenario.  I posted this in the warriors sub during the draft, but my big board prior to this draft was:  1) Cunningham  2) Green  3) Mobley  4) Suggs  5) Kuminga  6) Barnes  7) Giddey  8) Moody  You can't do better than getting two of the top eight players that I had at picks #7 and #14.    Do I think the warriors can win a title next year?  No, I don't, unless something completely unforeseen happens at the start of free agency.  What these two picks allow is for the warriors to move on from Kent Bazemore and from Mychal Mulder as regular rotation players.    Right now, you can divide the roster into the ""present"" and the ""future"".  That's part of the dual thread-the-needle team-building strategy they're employing.  The present is:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney  The future is:  Mannion, Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman  In the second half of last year, Poole took the jump, and he figures to slide in as the warriors sixth man this year, he's both the future AND very much going to help in the present.  Mannion is playing well in the Olympics, hoping for more development from him.  Wiseman should be a lot better in year two.    Now, besides these two parts of the roster, they have the ""rest"", which right now consists of:   JTA, Damion Lee, Eric Paschall  Paschall can be cut if need be, they'd have to swallow some money, but it's doable.  Ditto Damian Lee.  JTA is the only guy on this tier with significant financial guarantees, and also the best player.    What this means is the warriors have easy room to add at least two free agents next week, three if they can keep Nico Mannion on a two-way deal next season.  The draft is about your future, free agency is about addressing the roster holes you have in the present.    The dubs should go into free agency and see what they can get.  As time goes on, hopefully more and more of the future starts to contribute to the present.    The easiest way for an aging core to get back to title contention quickly is not to trade young players for a star, the easiest path back to the top is to do what the Spurs did: draft another star.  The cost controlled rookie scale contract, as opposed to the big money you'd have to pay an additional star, allow you to fill out your bench with depth.    The warriors won't be title contenders next year, but I think they'll make the moves in free agency to qualify for the playoffs as a top six seed in the west next year (and avoid the play-in tourney).  They can then build on that to take the next step to the top of the mountain again.    If there was a magic bullet trade that would make them title contenders now, they would have made that trade already.  That they haven't indicates there isn't such a trade to be had.  If no such trade exists, the best alternative is to accumulate assets for the point when a such trade does become available.    Kuminga and Moody are excellent assets for that trade, especially since to make such a big time trade will definitely require parting with Wiggins for salary matching reasons.  It would be awful nice to have players ready to step in if and when Wiggins gets dealt, wouldn't it?"
$14.2M in salaries?  wiseman+smiley+mychal mulder+gary payton ii.  if you don't want them just waive them before their next year becomes gauranteed.

Mychal Mulder and NAW
"Can't believe the Warriors got him for Mychal Mulder, Alen Smailagic, and a 2nd, what a steal. I think they're right when they say that trade is what led to their second dynasty"
Mychal Mulder - bro waits till the game is out of reach and then turns into prime steph curry from 3. I never saw the dude make a meaningful 3 all season
Seriously.  If they didn't have an 8 man roster that includes Mychal fuckin Mulder they make the playoffs no doubt.  Probably as the 7th seed.
Mychal Mulder and slander is redundant
This feels like unintentional Mychal Mulder slander.
"Maybe but doubtful right now. He couldn't even secure a roster spot over guys like Mychal Mulder, Damion Lee or Jordan Poole. For the Play-In round, they chose Gary Payton III, Smailagic and JORDAN FUCKING BELL over having Mannion on the bench.   He does seem to have great poise when he  was on the court though but its always been with/against scrubs. I feel like he's trying to play ""right"" and not make mistakes, instead of showing out so not really sure what is special about him yet. I hope I'm proven wrong though and he breaks out next season since GS really needs a solid backup PG for the second unit"
"I’d love to have Moody at 7th and maybe Kispert Wagner or Ziaire Williams at 14th. I doubt Wagner is at 14th, though  Kispert will be a great fit for the Warriors.   Someone on r/warriors really said Kispert is basically another Mychal Mulder.   So many bums on that subreddit"
"No, he's not worth the contract you guys gave him. But between the choices of having him and not having him, I'd rather have him  That being said, he's averaged his highest TS (57%), highest eFG% (54%), highest 3p (38%) he's ever had. He also has career highs in WS/48, VORP, DPBM, and VORP. As for his on/off numbers, Kerr usually has him playing with the bench unit, so he gets to play with fringe NBA players Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee  Is he a superstar? Nope, never will be. He's a high level role player at best. But I've been very pleased with his performance with us and have nothing bad to say about him. As long as owners are willing to pay, why should I care about his contract?"
"Canada has Wiggins, RJ Barrett, Cory Joseph, Dwight Powell, Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Trey Lyles, Mychal Mulder, and home court so it will be tough for Turkey to qualify, but should be a good tourney with Greece and China also having decent teams."
I’ll give you some gently-used equipment from the video room and one Mychal Mulder for him
The X-Files Duo: (Agent) Mychal Mulder and Juan Tuscano-(Gillian)-Anderson
At this point I still think the two most likely are GPII or Mychal Mulder.
"A 28 year old Shaun Livingston would be ideal.  Given that the Warriors don't appear to want to spend the MLE I think it's quite likely that they sign GPII or Mychal Mulder on a minimum. Both have pros and cons although Mulder is not someone who will run an offense when Steph sits, he's a SG.   There is even a chance they simply leave the 15th roster spot open going into the season. They are in the repeater and will save on their tax bill that way and since they did not use the MLE if a needle mover comes along on the buyout market and the team is playing well enough to be attractive it would give them some roster flexibility."
"&gt; Curry was carrying straight bums, Juan Toscano became one of the best players and Mychal Mulder was having heavy minutes.   Harden carried a *starting* frontcourt of Omer Asik and Patrick Patterson to 45 wins."
"Curry was carrying straight bums, Juan Toscano became one of the best players and Mychal Mulder was having heavy minutes. With Steph playing our record was good for 6th seed but he missed 8 games of which they lost 7 (of course). We got the 8th seed and faced the AD/LeBron Lakers, that's just bad luck (almost won it too with Steph cooking their entire team)."
"Warriors saw last year how important it is to have a backup true point guard. They don't have all those forwards/wings who can ball handle anymore, they don't have Shaun Livingston anymore, and when Curry sat last year the team has massive offensive struggles.   They've got Mychal Mulder, the two way guard from Italy, Chiozza, they worked out Darren Collison, that 15th roster spot is definitely going to a guard and hopefully they can bring on a true PG who can run an offense and isn't booty like Wanamaker was last season."
Mychal Mulder automatically becomes a Curry-Bird hybrid when we're up or down 30 in the fourth.
"They don't have a true backup PG. I personally think Poole can get there but right now he's at best a combo guard who probably can be relied on to run your offense if Curry's not available.   That was one of the biggest problems for the Warriors last season. Curry was amazing but he had to be. That roster didn't have anyone on it who could take some load off of Curry and punish teams for loading up on him. Wanamaker just didn't play well and the only secondary ball handler the team really had was Draymond.   Training camp will be a competition between Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Darren Collison. If Collison looks at all like he used to he's the obvious choice, to me at least."
"Because Brad Wanamaker lead the league in 4th quarter minutes for half the season and Mychal Mulder was playing 20 mpg by the end lol  Steph &amp; Draymond were great, Wiggins was pretty good. You need more than 3 sufficient players to win the West"
"How does one Damion ""Splash Brother-in-Law"" Lee sound? Before you say no, keep in mind that powers are unlocked if he plays with S. Curry on the team  Call now and we'll throw in one mint condition Mychal ""Thompson"" Mulder"
"Instead of MYCHAL MULDER, KENT BAZEMORE, DAMION LEE, KELLY OUBRE JR., ERIC PASCHAL, brad wannamaker, the Warriors will have KLAY FRICKIN THOMPSON taking the open shot .... Teams will have to keep an eye on Curry for 30+ minutes every night, running around screens whilst Klay will probably be setting those screens. Klay is more than a shooter and knows the Warriors ball movement and knows to pass it for a better shot. However, what's better than a Klay Thompson top of the 3 point line ball screen for Curry to pass the ball to Klay to shoot a couple feet behind the line? Or could give and go to Curry for the easy 3 or drive to the basket, only to open up an open shooter.  Too many possibilities with just Klay on the court with Curry. There's a reason why they were so dominant, those 2 are probably the best 1 2 offensive punch in NBA history. Klay won't need to sprint every minute he's on the court, I expect him to play smart since he's one of the smartest players on the team."
"Our roster outside of Steph, Draymond, Wiggins, Looney, Poole and JTA did not belong on an NBA court. Wiseman was basically forced into starter minutes by the front office when he has played like 4 games of college ball and isn't NBA ready yet, Oubre shot like Ben Simmons for the first half of the season and we gave absolute scrubs like Brad Wanamaker and Mychal Mulder significant minutes. We had so many close games where whenever our starters sat the bench would just do nothing the whole time and we would lose a 1 or 2 possession game to teams we were very capable of beating. If Klay comes back at 70-80% of his former self we are actually a strong playoff team imo, a starting lineup of Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney and Bench of JTA, Poole, Iggy and the youngsters  is enough to contend with the best in the conference.   Wiggins was actually really good for us, don't get me wrong he's not suddenly an all-star or anything but he's a much needed defensive wing for us where we lack depth and he had career highs in FG% and 3PT%. There were a lot of issues with our roster last year but Wiggins was a bright spot for us and I think he won over a lot of fans who had low expectations and were pleasantly surprised (me included)"
Mychal Mulder
"Game would 95-95 with 5 mins left in the fourth.  Steph gets double teamed while putting up 35.  He pass to open Mychal Mulder. Oh shit, it's not garbage time so he bricks it.  Rebound to Oubre. Goes straight into the paint with 2 defenders. Miss floater.  Final score 98-109 Warriors lose"
"I have an old comment somewhere about the Warriors' spacing last year. That comment also advocated for playing Mychal Mulder more so idk if it was misguided. However, Oubre was on that cold streak to start the season, Draymond can't shoot jumpers anymore, Wiseman wasn't taking any, and Wiggins is an  average shooter by percentage (but decent when open). And the backups that could shoot decently we're usually the ones replacing Curry in the lineup, like Poole, Lee, and Mulder. it was rough, but that made what Curry did last season even more extraordinary.  I think all in all, I caught like 15 Warriors games last season. Severe lack of spacing, some low BBIQ players, and just not a lot of talent to go around after the three best players. Even a prime LeBron can't carry that roster past the first round of the playoffs in the West.  I did notice Wiseman improving by the game. Not getting much college experience definitely stalled his growth a little but I think he had gotten to a playable state before he got injured. I'm not sure how useful he'll be this season but I have hope in him shouldering some of the load in future seasons."
"I remember seeing people bagging on Steph last season for not being able to carry the Warriors to the playoffs, but what they conveniently left out (probably because they didn't watch any Warriors games until the play-ins) was that the roster was a hot mess in 2020-2021.  Starters: Curry, Draymond, Wiggins, contract-year Oubre (yikes), half-injured Looney or Wiseman (oof)   Bench: Bazemore (the duality of Baze), Damion Lee, Poole (was decent last year but keeps improving), JTA (has been solid), the other of Looney/Wiseman  Almost G-league: Mychal Mulder (waived though I expect him to find a spot), Eric Paschall (with us now but he needs to prove himself to stay in the NBA long term), Brad Wanamaker (gone, whew), Nico Mannion (in Italy), Alen Smailagic (god he looked terrible), then Mitten/Chriss/Bell (barely played, Chriss because of injury)  They replaced those almost G-leaguers (and Bazemore) with Bjelica, Iggy, OPJ, and two lottery picks. That's quite the reload, especially considering their cap constraints. Going from 7 to 10 rotation-level players is *huge*. Here I am wondering if the Jazz even have 9 rotation-level players after really only having 7 last season (Niang was a liability in the playoffs and Favors was a liability in general). Getting up to 12 with Klay's/Wiseman's returns will give them crazy flexibility and they can weather the annual injuries to Looney/OPJ/Iggy.  Note: Oubre and Wiseman had some utterly abysmal +/- numbers. Some of Oubre's could be explained by playing lineups centered around Wiggins/Oubre but still. Wiseman came in super raw and got destroyed on defense."
joe harris giving me mychal mulder vibes lmao
"The guy above is being a huge douche, but I have to respectfully disagree. The warriors were only play-in last year because Steph missed a critical stretch of about 8-10 games (all of which were very winnable with Steph, but of which the Warriors lost all but one) which moved them down by about 4 seeds. Also, they had to deal with Wiseman's struggles in the first half of the season, Oubre's horrendous mismatch with the team's offense, and Brad Wanamaker leading the second unit (among a host of issues).  This year, the team is SO much better than last year in roster construction with or without Klay. For instance, Mychal Mulder was starting games and getting serious minutes in our play-in games last year, and was third in line for our 15th spot this year. And even with last year's roster we would've been about 6th seed if not for Steph's injury.  Meanwhile, the Clippers (Kawhi out) and Lakers (many reasons) look worse than last year, and Nuggets don't have Jamal Murray for now. I'm definitely biased, but I think barring more bad injury luck, Warriors are solidly a playoffs team even before Klay gets back (in my mind, mid-tier playoffs team)."
"they're all just going to the gleague.  the only guys they were seriously considering for the 15th spot was avery bradley, gp2, mychal mulder."
"Uhhh a starter and a HOFer’s son with his namesake. If you don’t know Jordan Bell you simply just didn’t watch the Warriors Superteam in the regular season, if you don’t know Mychal Mulder I don’t blame you, but if you don’t know Avery Bradley or Gary Payton you just don’t know basketball."
"mychal mulder who is named after klay's dad, jordan bell who gsw drafted back in 2017 and was a minor contributor on their last 2 playoff runs but was let go because he lacked discipline or something.  brought back on a two-way for a few days at the end of last season and signed to a training camp contract (but probably not for serious consideration for a roster spot)."
"Nah the garbage time god is Mychal Mulder, man could not miss in garbage time lol"
"right now they only have 14 gauranteed nba contracts and 1 two-way; the rest are either training camp contracts or non-gauranteed (GP2 and Mychal Mulder).  it's down to deciding who gets that last regular roster spot, if anyone.  if they cut mulder and he's not picked up by another team, he's eligible for a two-way, but none of the other candidates are."
Well first Poole should have improved. Hopefully curry won't miss 1/7 of the season. Wiggins might improve some. Our role players are a lot better now. We were playing Mychal mulder key minutes. A player that shot 33% from in any situation outside of low leverage minutes as a player whose only role is to shoot.  We replaced oubre who couldn't play in the play ins with OPJ who fits much better. And we should have Klay back for the 2nd half o the season who at minimum is a huge upgrade on Mulder and Lee as a bench player because he's a consistent shooter and even with his injury will be a better defender.
"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
"With the amount of drama Kyrie Irving brings the list of players I would rather have on my team than him runs a hell of a lot deeper than that.  I wouldn't trade him straight-up for Jordan Poole, and I'd be iffy on Mychal Mulder, and Mulder's usually only good in garbage time. Genuinely I think Kyrie might be a net negative, just for the sheer scale of drama and distraction."
"He was good on defense. And for a league with so little defensive guards you can count them on a single hand, what he brings defensively is an asset.   That being said, dude doesn't have any offense. We used to try putting him as a back-up guard for Steph but because he can't hit for shit, his usage dropped. And for a team that needed offense badly, what he brings to the table just isn't enough. Especially if we can run guard duties through JTA, who's just as good of a defender but a surprisingly good playmaker and shooter.   The team had top 5 defense without him. If we gave him more minutes, while his offense is that atrocious, it would just be subtraction by addition. I mean, we seriously needed offense so much we had to give Garbage Time GOAT Mychal Mulder more shooting responsibilities."
Off the court : Andrew Wiggins  On the court : Mychal Mulder
On the court it’s gotta be Mychal Mulder.
Chiozza is who Mychal Mulder was supposed to be
"Personally I wish we could have kept him, how could you not want the sexiest man in the nba and also in human history on your team? He also had a few amazing stretches for the Warriors last year, rebounding, scoring, shooting well all while playing great defense. Curious if that's essentially what Charlotte has gotten out of him?  As for why we actually sucked last year, Oubre also had stretches of being a turnover and missed FG machine and a awful three point shooter (Defense was consistently good). Wanamaker couldn't shoot or playmake and his defense would have been mediocre on any team that didn't have a much worse defensively and offensively Jordan Poole, mychal mulder, and nico mannion as the defensive alternative backup guards. Kent Bazemore honestly had some crazy hustle on both ends and shot 40% from three in golden state but he fouled a ton, as did Wiseman.   Oubre definitely was not the problem with the Warriors season."
Do you think Jamahl Mosley knows that he doesn't have to play Mychal Mulder for nearly 24 minutes?   Franz was actually playing well after those back to back terrible games against the Bucks and his reward was a shortened 4th quarter rotation so that Mulder could play 10 straight minutes of terrible basketball.
Magic started Mychal Mulder - that’s a designed tank move if I’ve ever seen one
"Brad Wanamaker played so many games, they relied heavily on smelly poubre, kent bazemore played soo many minutes, Nico manion, mychal mulder, Eric paschall, honestly wtf are you talking about lol? This is a completely different team"
"Mychal ""Garbage time Jordan"" Mulder"
"Semi and Justin Robinson for Mychal Mulder, who says no?"
That 39-18 run to end the game from Orlando’s bench was absolutely hilarious even though they still lost the game. Mychal Mulder should be getting all of Gary Harris’s minutes going forward.
Well the Magic has Mychal “garbage time MJ” Mulder
Target Mychal Mulder.
"Marquis Teague, James Young, Archie Goodwin, Isaiah Briscoe, Tyler Ulis, Ashton Hagans, Mychal Mulder  Granted I think a lot of them could have been good pieces (like Ulis was a legitmately good back up PG, I'm not sure why he got kicked to the curb)"
if only you had mychal mulder
Yeah mychal mulder. The warriors depth last year was horrendous.
We need Mychal Mulder back to make the final point differential look better
"Comparing getting rid of Mychal Mulder, Marqueese Chriss and Kelly Oubre in favor of OPJ, Bjelica and GP2 to a bad player being 1 year older is certainly an interesting comparison"
Mychal Mulder is around here somewhere
We needed garbage time Mychal Mulder out there.
"“Why lose by 40 when you can lose by 30 on better efficiency?”  -Mychal Mulder, every day in front of his bathroom mirror"
&gt; Talen is the best garbage time player I've ever seen  This is disrespectful to Mychal Mulder and I won't have it.  Mychal Mulder has never missed in garbage time ^^and ^^never ^^hit ^^when ^^the ^^game ^^was ^^still ^^in ^^play
Then you’ve clearly never watched mop-up Mychal Mulder.
Mychal Mulder in garbage time
"Jordan ""Mychal Mulder"" Poole."
I mean that last year there were 10 USA roster spots and 10 world roster spots. There was 13-15 USA players that deserved it and only 7-8 world guys that deserved to be in it last year. Last year guys like Mychal Mulder made it because they weren’t American and guys like Quickley didn’t
"And they had Mychal Mulder who was, apparently, named after Klay's dad."
"Whoooooa there  Only the Best Warrior player of all-time, behind GP2  1. GP2  2. Jordan (Poole)  3. Garbage Time Mychal Mulder  4. Steph  5. Wilt"
I feel it. Mychal Mulder went from starting some games and being one of the first off the bench to not cracking the top 14 or 15 this year. Warriors had such a good offseason. But I feel the pain lol
Just ask Mychal Mulder
mychal mulder of defense.
