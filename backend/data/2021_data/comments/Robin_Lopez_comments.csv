"The Wizards need to sign a Centre. Robin Lopez has been ass and I believe they just signed Alex Len who is a rotation player. Without a starting centre that can protect the rim and drop 15 pts a game, it’s going to be a long year for the Wizards and Beal’s frustration will only grow."
"DC as a big city should have winning on it's radar. Every big city wants to have a winning sports team. Fortunately DC already has winning sports teams, just not in Basketball lol. But the annoying thing is that DC has the potential to have a great basketball team. Clearly two cornerstone players are here but right now the whole roster is a mixture of being a rebuilding project with pieces that want to contend. It's not right. It's a shame Atlanta absorbed such a high amount of FA last off season. Maybe someone changes their mind and decides to play in the nation's capital but really why bother when there are warmer cities that have cap space and the other north east cities are clearly contenders while DC just bumbles along with some of the best offensive players in the league.  Some of this has to do with just a bad FO though, like yes some of the young guys drafted have potential and some of them not showing their full ability falls on the coaching staff but good lord the supporting pieces, like could DC have made a better decision around what makes sense when you have a great offensive weapon already? Like yes bringing in Robin Lopez is supposed to boost defense a little bit but would it have been better to have taken Matisse Thybulle instead of Rui where Matisse looks like a defensive beast. Of course Rui still has potential and all that but man what is a guy like Raul Neto supposed to bring? A plug and play offensive player that is undersized and cannot do much else? Like is having him in addition to Ish Smith. Oh man and of course the year after we extend him Bertans the ""Latvian Laser"" is now shooting 32% from 3. Like wow if his production stays down low this long then that's an awful contract for a player that no longer has any upside."
"A lot of blame for the Wizards problems gets left at Russ's feet, but good god is Robin Lopez bad on defense. Our entire first half offense was just driving to the elbow and wait for him to help badly, and then make 1-2 passes off of that. Honestly they didn't really defend us as much as bank on misses and trading buckets."
"I think Scott Brooks is the main problem in washington. I think it really boils down to he's been burying wagner who's really kind've perfect match for Russ at the 5, he's also at least an average defender maybe above average when you factor in his ability to switch for a 5. Russ can also help on the glass which is wagner's real weakness. His on/off numbers have been insanely good so far. I think these ish neto backcourts combined with robin lopez are just killing them. Wagner should play 30 mpg on that team. With that being said Russ probably isn't top 20 anymore and there's no shame in that, he's still good enough to take over games against anyone any given night."
"robin Lopez is coming up so high on the screen, KD going by him every time"
great seal in the paint by Robin Lopez
"Missed a great Rodney hood joke for flippin, Robin Lopez!?!¿."
"They also lost Robin Lopez, and also added Bobby Portis + DJ Augistin"
"**Robin Lopez:** ""I'm just trying to make a living just like you."""
Robin Lopez hood has been booed off the court. People showing up at his house.
feel like they could use another big body - someone like robin lopez would be decent playing 10-15 mins
"tbh the only 'bad' losses have been to Chicago/Orlando and maybe yesterday with the hawks.    12 losses  - 5 were there ones mentioned above ... 3 of them were very close games though.  - Losses to NOP/HOU/SAS .. we were missing half our roster.  - Loss to MIA we were missing Westbrook/Beal and Bryant tore his ACL a couple minutes in.  - 2 Losses to 76ers were close ... Embiid became unstoppable .. and some bad offensive execution  - Loss to Celtics ... was kinda bad too since they were missing some bigs  ---  Overall a few key issues  - Scott Brooks is a moron.  - Offensive system consists of give the ball to Beal or Westbrook and watch them do something.  - Defense sucks to, players aren't great ... but coaching is pretty weak here.  - Rotations seems pretty bad. Brooks insists on playing 2-3 PG lineups. He also often decides to play Westbrook with Ish Smith, Robin Lopez, and Jerome Robinson for some reason.   - Lacking a good defensive big. Bryant was good offensively .. but clueless on defense. We actually looked better on defense with Lopez.  - Bad defenders in general.  - Westbrook is bad, focuses too much on rebounding and doubling  - Beal is AVG in my opinion, but sometimes looks disinterested in defense when the team is doing bad.  - Hachimura is a bit clueless on defense at times.   - Advija has good instincts, but he's still a rookie .. and slow at times.   - Bryant is just bad at defense, makes a highlight play every now and then.   - Most of our bench players are just bad at defense too ... Bertans (can only shoot 3s), Ish Smith / Raul Neto  (just too small), Matthews ( good effort, but a bit frantic)   - Lopez is good at times, but isn't athletic so ... can be a problem.   - Bonga is a decent defender ... but doesn't get playing time, fouls too much though"
Robin Lopez as your 3rd best player will do crazy things to a dude
"They, along with Beal, had been chirping all game. Russ already had a tech at this point, Beal had one and Robin Lopez had already been booted with a double tech.  Rondo had one also and he eventually got the boot as well. This wasn't just an isolated play, it was the refs trying to get shit in check."
"&gt;Bradley Beal, Robin Lopez FOR Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, 1st Round pick  &gt;Beal, Moritz Wagner FOR James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota pick, 1 warriors pick  How the fuck are you equating these two deals, my god"
Well sure. Some will be traded for but others aren't on the best contracts to trade for. Robin Lopez is on 7 mil. Most contenders would have to give up their MLE guy to get him which may not be enough to put them over the edge.   I think New York will trade Noel to the Nets. He gives them rebounding and defending plus he can switch onto the perimeter. If he plays regular minutes he will get 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks a game. Which is obviously very nice.
"Our GM said he was going to build a playoff team around him, and failed. In a ""win-now"" season the only help we got him was Westbrook, Bertans on big contract, Robin Lopez and young players who aren't ready to compete.   He is more than justified in asking for a trade if we wants"
Watching robin Lopez try to get a defensive rebound and tipping it to Houston in game 6 to put them up 2 with .9 seconds left feeling that Houston would win game 7. I was so deflated. Then dame hit the game winner.
"Nobody wanna gets suspended, that shit costs money  And nobody actually be throwing punches anymore anyway, when was the last fight in the NBA where you saw guys actually be swinging at each other and not the usual ""hold me back fam"" schtick? CP3 vs Rondo? Robin Lopez vs Serge Ibaka?"
"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
Did you see his teammates?? The starting lineup was Raul Neto Beal Isaac Bonga Jordan Bell and Robin Lopez... who else is supposed to fucking shoot lmao
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
"When your second highest scorer is Robin lopez and everyone else on the roster shot sub 40%, you're gonna lose every game.   This reminds me of the 06 Lakers but at least they had Odom and a few other pieces."
His best teammates were Robin Lopez and Garisson Mathews.
"not the best or anything but woulda been fun with:2017 bulls: Celtics rondo (or maybe lakers playoffs rondo? jk lol), prime flash (2006 mvp version), miami jimmy 'business trip' butler (2020 bubble version), 2017-18 cleanshave fiery nikola mirotic (when he got traded to the pelicans) and robin lopez (not sure which is the best, maybe 2014 portalnd?) with a bench of mcw (2014 rookie of the year version) and current day indy doug mcdermott. Not the best, but woulda been fun"
"Here's a fun one:  **Steve Nash**/Goran Dragic  **Raja Bell**/Leandro Barbosa  **Grant Hill**/Jason Richardson/Matt Barnes  **Amare Stoudemire**/Boris Diaw  **Shaquille O'Neal**/Robin Lopez  Not the greatest, but a really cool squad"
"Underrated 2008 Suns.   Nash, Shaq, Amare, Grant Hill.  Bench includes Barbosa, Jason Richardson, Matt Barnes, Boris Diaw, Robin Lopez, Raja Bell, Drajic."
"His best teammate tonight was either Robin Lopez or Isaac Bonga, there is no way to pin this loss on him."
"Rui hachimura,thomas bryant, davis bertans, robin lopez       Amirite?"
the next leading scorer was Robin Lopez.   that’s all that needs to be said really
Al Horford and Robin Lopez are great at this as well.
"half our team is missing ...  although for some reason brooks played the other starters with Beal ... left our better offensive players on the bench    ... and played Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Robin Lopez with Russ ...  not sure how he hasn't been fired yet ..."
Robin Lopez. I loved that huge hairy monster.
"So many commenters didn't actually read the article and it shows. What Tjarks actually means is that Giannis should be focusing on developing his midrange and floater game so that defenses can't blatantly wall him off. Yeah Giannis can't shoot, but if he can't, why is he pulling up from deep in the first place?  Most importantly, Tjarks noted the differences in how AD and Giannis are utilized defensively. The Bucks could definitely learn a thing or two from how the Lakers utilize AD as a small ball 5, and how AD uses his tools to guard anyone effectively. That would be preferable to using Giannis as a free safety defender, seeing how their defense has downgraded due to the loss of defensive players like George Hill, Robin Lopez and Bledsoe. Bryn Forbes can't guard a toothbrush, and Portis gets cooked by big men on a nightly basis."
"""This league is full of theatrics and thespians. Several of you are worthy of Oscar level performances for what you've done tonight. All of you should be embarrassed. All of you... Embarrassed."" - Robin Lopez"
"People will say the Wizards, but we really should have expected with Scott Brooks as the coach.  We've been close down the stretch in pretty much all of our losses, if Brooks didn't put out brain dead lineups through the game it would help. Somehow thinks Westbrook will be good with Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Robin Lopez on the floor.    and TBH only the 2 losses to the magic/bulls each have been bad early in the season, were even unexpected. We've played a lot better since then.    Having close losses to the 76ers (2x), Celtics, and Heat (w/o Beal, Westbrook) .. aren't really bad losses."
Robin Lopez
"As great as Shaq is, he always hating especially against centers. I think he talks down on them  because he know that some of the centers in the league are better than him(skull wise). Especially with Dwight Howard, he's been hating on that man since he was in Orlando. I remember he said that Andrew Bynum and Robin lopez was better than Dwight because they play like ""true big man"" and Dwight plays like a  ""European style big men""."
"Technical foul on Robin Lopez, tackled teams own mascot G-Wiz."
So he didn’t break a steel door but the fucker is crazy here’s the [story](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.brightsideofthesun.com/platform/amp/2015/7/21/9005009/robin-lopez-broken-door-phoenix-suns-hot-head)
Bro you haven’t heard the story of Robin Lopez. Allegedly tearing a steel door in the practice facility
Lmaooo I have no idea who looks crazier him or Robin Lopez
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
"Offense: Steph, Harden, Lebron, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez Defense: Jrue Holiday, Kawhi, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez  I feel that this is the only correct list"
"You shouldn't bank on filling a starting job with the buyout market since you never know what's available. You usually just pick up useful bench pieces.   Robin Lopez, Whiteside, Boogie could become available tho"
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
Connecting the dots I do think Nets are gonna add Hassan Whiteside or Javale Mcgee using the disabled player exception and second round picks or buyout market. They probably want to see if anyone is bought out and how Claxton looks before pulling the trigger.  As you mentioned Robin Lopez is prob also on the radar but with Thomas Bryant hurt I'm not sure it is likely unless Bradley Beal is gonna get moved
Robin Lopez and Aron Baynes are some likely buy out candidates
"Last year the best ones were Marvin Williams, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris, Jeff Green, and MKG. 2019 was the best I can remember in recent years, Wes Matthews, Wayne Ellington, Enes Kanter, Jeremy Lin, Carmelo.  Realistic ones I can think of this year are Robin Lopez again and maybe Aron Baynes? If the Raptors continue to struggle"
"Tristan Thompson, Montrezl Harrell, Serge Ibaka got paid 9m/yr each. Robin Lopez got 7m. Steven Adams got a 2 years extension for 17m/yr. And those were in the same free agency. Sure, Dwight's injury history and past locker room history might hurt his value a little but I would assume that he's worth at least the same as some of the names on this list"
Kyrie for Westbrook and Robin Lopez  DJ and TLC for Ibaka?
Robin Lopez of the Washington Wizards ladies and gentlemen.
Robin Lopez is a better defensive center than Andre Drummond.   Why the hell would Washington trade 5 guys and a Top 10 draft pick for Andre Drummond? Wtf
"The one time I played MyPlayer, every fucking time boban was on the court he would mug my point guard for the ball. I fuckin got excited once because drew a sixth foul on drummond (this is back when they were both pistons) and then realized that meant Boban *HAD* to come in for him.  The other thing i learned about 2k is that Robin goddamn Lopez is apparently Kareem when he shoots hook shots because he pretty much never missed those, the weird janky directional inputs were the only reason he wouldn't score literally every single time he got the ball in the post he was averaging 25/10 on my fantasy drafted team... also his backup was Boban because I learned, and I was not disappointed."
I swear there's a video out there where he calls Robin Lopez the best center in the league over Dwight Howard during Dwight's career season in 2011/2012. Shaq petty af.
"Robin Lopez? would be cool to have a Lopez twin back as a Net, but Wizards will probably want to use him"
Can we have one of these big men? Rn the wiz are rocking pretty much Robin Lopez and Mo Wagner and that’s not sustainable at all lmao
Suns twitter is currently melting down over Ayton again which is appropriate given he was outplayed by Robin Lopez
"The mistake was more so in losing his contract vs losing him as a player. That contract for payroll flexibility was worth way more than what bucks got for him. The bucks felt that George Hill + Robin Lopez + Wes Matthews &gt; Brogdon. In terms of regular season wins, this is probably true (and cheaper), but definitely not true for playoffs with less of need for deep roster. The butterfly effect of keeping brogdon on team would be a loaded question. If we could have Holiday-brogdon-Khris-Giannis-Lopez, with DD off bench, I take that 10/10 times, but I doubt our current team looks the way it does with brogdon kept."

"I haven't really watched Robin Lopez since he was on the Bulls, but I remember him being a solid shot blocker/part-time GEICO mascot"
"Somehow Robin Lopez feasted.  Bertans killed it in the first half. Beal did Beal things.    Not sure why our lead was so large at the half but there no coming back from that.    GG, I still think you all will be fine."
Robin Lopez and Mo Wagner are lockdown defenders everyone knows this.
So I guess Thomas Bryant has been the problem this entire time. Unleash ROBIN LOPEZ
I still don't get how Robin Lopez is able to literally able to get the ball-handler trapped every single time he sets a screen.
Robin Lopez outplaying Ayton. What the hell lol
"Is there a stat on how many turnovers he has when robin lopez is on the floor? I definitely see him getting picked more often, i feel like ot might be that hes slowing down, but also hes dribbling more maybe? He isnt just getting to his spot to shoot, and he keeps doing bad postups. Usually he rocks back and forth for a shot or bank shot. Also it kinda feels like hes treating bryant and lopez like steven adams where he can catch it wherver and hit a flip shot"
Yea.  He was a liability on defense but could atleast put up points on offense.  A rotation of moe wagner and robin lopez isn't going to be great.
"Ideally, you can at least construct an offensive roster with the team.  Starters: Russ / Beal / Deni / Rui / Thomas Bryant (I know he tore his ACL) - In a perfect world that's 4 shooters around Russ.  Bench: Ish Smith / Troy Brown / Mo Wagner / Issac Bonga / Robin Lopez - It's not a fantastic bench but whatever  I could have seen the argument that they could fight for the play-in but things have just fallen off a cliff."
Either way we still don't have a competent big on defense.  Yes i mean you robin lopez
Former Shaq teammates still in league.  Lebron James - Lakers Avery Bradley - Heat Rajon Rondo - Hawks Danny Green - 76ers Robin Lopez - Wizards
"I feel like the Wizards were a lot better than their record. Opposing teams were hitting open shots at above average rates and the Wizards were just losing every close game.   Now that the best Wizard centers are Robin Lopez and Mo Wagner, I’m not so optimistic."
"They have all the recent ex-Lakers' centers, or their brothers. ( Bryant, Wagner, and Robin Lopez )"
"Who’s the Wizards next center? Ik there’s Robin Lopez, but the Wizards aren’t exactly filled with depth at that position."
"Yikes, robin lopez will be starting for a few games, and we all know he should not be a starting center"
Bad news: Thomas Bryant might be seriously hurt and we'll have to watch Robin Lopez play basketball.  Good news: Mo Wagner is forced to get more minutes.
Don’t forget Robin “Better Brother” Lopez going with 10 points on 4/4 shooting
Robin Lopez at 7 feet looks like a kid in this clip.
"Hill was great, he went in the Jrue trade (for no fucking reason, that trade would have been done without him)  Wesley Matthews was a starter last year and is gone without replacement.  So last year 6&amp;7 were Donte and Hill. Then we had Robin Lopez who left in free agency."
"If only Scott Brooks didn't play him with Ish Smith and Robin Lopez, which would have definitely prevented him from chucking up contested threes, 18 footers and trying to dunk on Theis and Tacko"
"I think it has made him less aggressive this game. Also, the Celts weren't able to drive as much it feels since Robin Lopez wasn't out there."
Robin Lopez lookin more like sideshow bob every time I see him
Brook and Robin Lopez gang
"Derrick Rose  Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler  Bill Cartwright, Tyson Chandler  Kyle Korver, 2017-2018 Robin Lopez, Jamal Crawford   No Bias"
"Except that Adams is 10 times better than Robin Lopez and Poetl. Adams signed a $35 mil extension for 2 years, which is only 17m a year, not 30.  Adams is arguably just as important to the Pels as Ingram and Zion right now, due to how bad Hayes has played this season, so Adams is definitely worth every penny."
"I feel like you're misunderstanding most of the hate for the Adam's move. Its not just the fact that Adams doesn't shoot threes. Its that they paid him close to thirty million a year to do that.   With guys like Robin Lopez and Jakob Poetl are getting paid less than 10 mil a year, its super weird to sign Adams to a massive extension before even seeing how he'd fit with the team. Sure, maybe Adams turns out really good. But in a vacuum where he hasn't played any games yet, there's no logical reason to extend him for massive money when basic logic tells you that having 2 non shooters on a team is going to be worse than having only 1 non shooter."
"This year was supposed to be it. A healthy John, a healthy Brad, Bertans, Rui, Avdija, a solid back up point guard crew, Troy Brown, and offensive talent in Thomas Bryant, and a defense of stopper in Robin Lopez. Everything lined up perfectly for a above 50 win, in a regular season, season!"
Oh yeah of course but Robin Lopez stopd no chance against Joel either (you can watch our first game specifically for this) so Im less mad at him
"Except while he's a great rim protector, Robin Lopez isn't a good post defender either, probably still not as bad as Bryant, but still gets killed everytime he faces up someone who can back down"
"With the Wizards roster, Robin Lopez is the only one who even makes sense against Embiid and he still probably wouldn't be able to lockdown Embiid.  The rest of the roster is hot garbage defensively, they aren't playing lockdown defense on anyone. They honestly might as well just try to outgun the opposition since they have the firepower"
"Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Robin Lopez, Brook Lopez, Zubac, McGee, R Williams, Favours, etc."
If im blaming anything its Russ’ and Bertans’ defense specifically. Those two made by far the most egregious mistakes during the game on defense. Bryant is a terrible defender but to be fair so is Robin Lopez. The whole team just cant defend.
Beal can drop 70!  *robin Lopez chucks a 3*
Beal's making everything... our coach is dumb ... instead of playing Rui/Deni when Beal's on the bench ...  He pulls a lineup of Westbrook/Ish Smith/Jerome Robinson/Bertans/ Robin Lopez ....
"I thought it went between the legs and jumped out my seat. Alas, it was amazing. The ball moved so fluidly. That 2016 had the greatest chemistry I’ve seen a Rose, Butler, Dwade, Rondo with the old bulls but fucking garpax wanted Robin Fucking Lopez"
"Part of the reason why Westbrook is shooting so bad is because Brooks surrounds him with Ish Smith, Troy Brown, and Robin Lopez. He constantly plays him with zero spacing. Scott Brooks is the main problem though Westbrook was never an efficient player"
reminds me of Robin Lopez acting like a bitch last season cause he got dunked on by Jarrett Culver  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=galaLjaUijk
"We could’ve seen a Rose, Butler, Dwade, Rondo with the old bulls but fucking garpax wanted Robin Fucking Lopez"
Robin Lopez and ish Smith and a second rd pick
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
Robin Lopez knew
Robin Lopez would never
"It helps that CJ and Melo had been close friends for years, and wanted to play together, so not only is there a super clear pecking order and stable organization (third behind Spurs and Heat) but a really familiar rapport from working out during summers for years together with his friend who is the other star.    So you’ve got the clear alpha option with Dame, the secondary star in CJ, and Melo came in knowing how their games would mesh and the vet role he was asked to fill.    Stotts is adept at getting the best from role players, look at guys like Whiteside or Kanter in Portland vs elsewhere, guys like like Shabazz Napier, Seth Curry, Robin Lopez, Moe Harkless, Stotts makes roleplayers shine by playing to their strengths and minimizing their weaknesses."
"I did a search.  Doesn't show me top 10 but shows me 11-20.  Criteria I used was personal fouls = 0, minutes played greater than or equal to 20, 6 or more field goals attempted, and turnovers = 0.  Robin Lopez, Shaun Livingston, DeAndre Jordan, Dante Cunningham, Dan Buse, Danny Ainge, Randy Wittman, Dennis Rodman, David Lee, and Ended Lantern."
Robin Lopez is much better than him for like $5m. Adams has a $30m this year + $35m 2 year extension. Steven Adams needs to overhaul his terrible fitness regime. I read his profile a few years ago and he said he drank Guinness after every workout and knew this guy was doomed but didn't expect it to be this bad.
Robin Lopez honestly did a better job defending Jokic than anyone else has this season
"Curry, Ball, Holiday, Morris, and Lopez brothers would make a pretty dope team.  Steph/Jrue/Zo/Marcus/Brook  Melo/Seth/Justin/Markief/Robin  This could be a top 3 seed in the east"
Man seeing Jokic toy with Brook Lopez makes me wonder how on earth Robin Lopez was able to defend him
"That was actually the *second* time we got the pick. Originally it was the Lakers’, then it was traded to us with Rick Fox and Gary Payton for Chucky Atkins, Jumaine Jones, and Chris Mihm on August 6, 2004. We then traded it to the Hawks with Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton, and Michael Stewart for Antoine Walker on February 24, 2005. Then the Hawks traded it, the pick that became Robin Lopez, and Boris Diaw for Joe Johnson on August 19, 2005. Rondo was drafted by the Suns and then traded to us again in the salary dump on June 28, 2006 (the day of the draft)."
Robin Lopez didn’t drag his ass out of the cave and create fire for salads. He just yabba dabba doesn’t need salads anymore
"Ah yes, of course the genetics argument comes up.... every single 6'11"" guy is as good or better than Robin Lopez at basketball. This dude looks like a caveman.... he is tall with debatably shitty genetics. Maybe his brother has a BETTER work ethic than him but you cant sit here and say hes only good because hes 6'11""  Enough with the genetics argument please people  (Of fucking course it helps to be tall...... he still has a way different/better path than 95% of other 6'11"" folk in the world)"
"I often forget Robin has Latino heritage despite his last name. When I think of him, I imagine him to be the last of an isolated pocket of Neolithic cave Barbarians I suppose.  The Lopez twins are hilarious though."
The Salidity is low in Robin Lopez
Good ole' Ulysses reference in a Robin Lopez r/nba thread
"Dead serious. I used to work at a fancy, historic candy store. Both Robin and Brook Lopez came in when they were getting ready to play the 76ers the next night. Both dudes also spent like $200 in candy in one go.   Even in a fancy spot, 200 bucks worth of candy is a shit load."
"Robin Lopez on being a good player: “I generally will not be good at basketball...It almost seems like egregiously good, arrogantly good. I’m good at basketball, look at me, look how good I am.”"
"@robin Lopez, I eat salad because I like to have great poops and salads help ensure that"
"I never thought Robin Lopez would be the hero we needed to take on Big Salad.  Leslie Knope got the ball rolling, now Robin is going to take us to the promised land."
"Yeah, especially Robin Lopez of all people as the example."
[We all know what Robin Lopez likes to eat so this is no surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JUtgjSl2zs)
You're exactly who Robin Lopez is talking about in this quote.
How the fuck is Robin Lopez a professional athlete lol
"Jason Kidd, JR Smith, Melo in 2014 lol  Joakim Noah  DRose  Fucking Robin Lopez LMAO"
Lol when you give robin lopez a warning but not superstars
"&gt; “It’s well known throughout the league that the Memphis room service has always been a step below some of the other hotels,” says Washington’s Robin Lopez. “But that’s OK, because at least pre-COVID, you made up for it by having great barbecue options all over.”  Seems like a fair trade"
I guarantee Robin Lopez only orders the Big Salad
Missing Robin Lopez this year for reals
Cardinals fans hate Robin Lopez now
My brain worms had me momentarily thinking Robin Lopez joined The Ringer as a writer.
Robin Lopez is a national treasure.
"Team Mascot- ""Robin would you like some salad""  Robin Lopez - ""Since I am not a rabbit, no I do not""  Team Mascot - ""Try it, sounds good for you""  The start of the feud between Robin Lopez and team mascots"
"Robin Lopez has always been that guy in the NBA who never fails to make me laugh, he's so funny"
lol robin lopez is so relatable haha
It would have been a top 4 seed for sure if you replaced Wiseman with a vet center like Robin Lopez. They sacrificed some wins to bring Wiseman along. The starting lineup with Looney in place of Wiseman has been very good but he can't play that many minutes. They just need a guy who knows what he's doing and Curry/Draymond will take care of the rest.
It could have been a lot worse for the takes if the Warriors had given Curry a vet center like Robin Lopez or something. They'd be a top 3 or 4 seed in the West right now and Curry might just be the MVP frontrunner. They certainly sacrificed some wins this season to bring Wiseman along.
"Speaking of great athletes, the Wizards play by play guy the other day said Robin Lopez ""can't jump over a South Dakota phone book""....lol."
"This. What made Milwaukee so good the last 2 years was that their 2nd unit was much better than other 2nd units. Last year, George hill, divencenzo, Marvin Williams, and Robin Lopez was a really really good 2nd unit. And that doesn’t include Pat Connaughton, Kyle Korver, or Ersan. But none of that matters in playoffs. Cause your depth guys aren’t playing against other team 2s anymore. And you shouldn’t be going 10 deep in playoffs (bucks did). Part of the bucks current “struggles” is that their 2nd unit now sucks at defense. DD is a starter, Williams retired and Lopez and hill both on new teams. DJ Augustine, Bobby Portis, and Forbes are just not good defenders. While Holiday And DD are only slightly better D combo than Bledsoe and Matthew’s (much stronger O combo though). I’m still optimistic for bucks being better in playoffs if Bud commits to playing Jrue-Khris-Giannis as much as possible while Augustine, portis, and Forbes just fill in for points off bench."
Robin Lopez cant be much better lol
&gt; Explain how Robin Lopez was getting spoonfed when Harrell was in  Lopez is a center and he was going one on one against Montrezl. I already said Montrezl Harrell is not the guy you want defending a center one on one  The problems you laid out are fair but they're dependent on the team construction as you said since he's forced to be the C. That doesn't necessarily make Kuzma better. It just means he has an easier role
"&gt;I feel like statements like that make it seem like you don't watch games. Harrell performed his role really well against Jokic when the Lakers played the Nuggets with fully healthy AD.   No, he didn't lol. He gave good effort, but Jokic still just missed a lotta open shots.  Explain how Robin Lopez was getting spoonfed when Harrell was in. Why do you think he was? Do you think there was any reason the Wiz forcefed the ball to Robin Lopez in the 3rd so much?  &gt;If you ask Harrell to be a Center and protect the rim he's shit at that, but as a PF he's absolutely fine, providing value with his rebounding and being completely passable in the post. Both him and Kuz are PF's, and asked to be C's defensively is a nightmarish scenario for both  But there's 2 problems:  1. Harrell isn't a floor spacer who can do other things like Kuz, which clogs the lane for Bron 2. Harrell can't play the 4 in any lineup now with AD out, so he has to be our rim protector. He's listed as a C, so that's his expectation."
Robin Lopez of all people played him off the court lol
"He wouldn't be dominated by Robin Lopez, he would actually grab defensive rebounds, he would provide off ball value as a vertical spacing threat and he would do all of this for the vet minimum which would allow the Lakers to use the MLE on a shooter."
"This just isn’t true. The original foul was not a shooting foul and the wizards weren’t in the bonus so robin lopez was never going to the line. It was gonna be side out and the call stood, which kept it as side out"
"I don't understand the wizards starting lineup. Why are Wagner and Matthews starting when Bertans, Deni, and Robin Lopez are way more part of the top 6?"
"He stopped Robin Lopez, which was something Harrell couldn't do."
"He's washed, as expected, but we didnt have him in a big role when we're healthy so it didnt matter as much. He was gonna be like Javale last year, just play some reg season minutes and be glued to the bench in the playoffs  Now that he's our sole rim protector.... it's been pretty bad to say the least. He can hit some 3s, make some decent passes, but is the slowest big man in the league and doesn't put in effort to protect the rim  The sad thing is we desperately needed to put him in after a while because the Wiz made their comeback by playing Robin Lopez and just having him shoot over Trezz, lmao"
Robin Lopez out here looking like Encino Man
"The scores will be combined at 300 points on every game, except game 7, where both teams will struggle to reach 80, with Robin Lopez and DeAndre Jordan being the leading scorers for their teams"
This sub has a weird lame obsession with someone that’s supposedly some washed nobody now. I don’t see Robin Lopez posts every single day on here
"Most effective deployment of the ""send Robin Lopez out there to stumble around the court"" I've ever witnessed."
Robin Lopez was incredible this game
"If you have to chose which NBA player you want to practice karate with you're choosing Robin Lopez , right?"
Robin Lopez &gt; Bill Walton
"Every time I see Robin Lopez, I just feel like he belongs in the Geico Caveman commercials."
Robin Lopez is a big gamer.  He'd fit in nicely.
I was a random ass college kid at Michigan State randomly Facebook poking players who were in the NCAA tourney in 2008. Only Robin Lopez and Luc Mbah A Moute ever responded in any way. Robin and I had a poke war for a week that ended with him friend requesting me. Mbah A Moute responded to the first poke with a friend request. Still Facebook friends with both to this day. Zero interactions in the 13 years since.
"I dont agree. You could be right about the playoffs but thats just a prediction and means nothing. But we have already seen what Hill and Matthews contributed in the playoffs. Compared to the regular season, Matthews averaged fewer PPG, RPG and APG with a higher D rating. Hills 3 point percentage dropped by 10 points from the regular season. Robin Lopez barely played in the playoffs.  Further, Forbes and Craig are earning less money this season and are younger and more athletic than Hill and Matthews. Forbes is shooting better from 3 than Hill. Craig is shooting better from 3 than Matthews, and has a lower D rating.   Portis is better than Lopez in just about every measurable way, can switch on a pick and roll, and has been a positive leader and fan favorite. He is also making less money than Lopez."
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
"Who was a ""great"" role player from last year that isn't there now? George Hill? Wes Matthews? Robin Lopez? Not trying to hate but those guys aren't great role players, and aren't any better than Forbes, Craig, Portis.."
Drummond rebounds himself but he doesn't actually make you a great redounding team.  If you actually want to be a good at rebounding get yourself Robin Lopez.
“You gotta just decide I’m gonna dominate. You gotta get 30-20 and just dominate the game.”  Well Shaq you’re analyzing Robin Lopez so I don’t think that’s gonna happen.
Man I thought Tyler Johnson was robin lopez for a second
"I don't really want him but we could get there with Thomas Bryant, Robin Lopez, Ish Smith, and Jerome Robinson ..."
"&gt; except for maybe CP3  Dame more for sure. Paul had all of the chances to get there that Dame hasn't had. A championship-winning coach, prime Blake, prime DeAndre, 6MOY, etc. Then to a similar situation in Houston, championship coach, scoring champ/MVP, etc.   Dame has been carrying teams for near a decade, often with crazy injuries and/or no depth. Best shot was with LMA, Batum, Robin Lopez, and Wesley Matthews, but the whole season ended in January with a slew of injuries starting with Wesley Matthews blowing his Achilles."
What do you think Robin Lopez did here?
"Yes, that's a foul, but Robin Lopez went all but Sean Taylor on Facu. Of the two, that's the more egregious in my obviously biased opinion."
Look at Beal run into Greens back at the start and then whatever you wanna call what robin lopez did on this play
Which one? Beal running into Green at the start or when robin lopez threw out his elbows 2ft away from his body?
George Hill was amazing for them and he’s gone. Staple vets like Ersan Ilysova are gone. Korver and Williams are gone. Robin Lopez is gone. They had a lot of roster turnover and not all of the new guys are up to par with their old bench.
"Stotts is a coach who specifically is good at getting the best out of his role players, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Seth Curry, Shabazz Napier, Allen Crabbe, Maurice Harkless, he’s extremely good at putting players into positions to shine with their particular skillsets and it’s why we’ve had so many reclamation projects or seen so many journeymen get paid after stops in Portland.  Hell, look at how good he managed to make Hassan Whiteside look after he wasn’t even seeing the court anymore."
Robin Lopez agrees.
Why does it feel like the only non beal/westbrook plays they run are robin lopez post ups. He is basically the third option
The Robin Lopez and mascots beef is the funniest beef in sports history and absolutely nothing will come even close to it
Robin Lopez: surprisingly productive
"Troy Brown Jr. ish smith, Robin lopez. Thomas Bryant and the 4 mill exception. Get it done. Thanks I’ll be waiting to draft Andre Drummond as a wizard on draftkings."
Robin Lopez is a natural treasure.

"This is compared to Robin Lopez and Alex Len.  Mo Wagner is a way better defender than those 2. You want to compare him to Bam, sure he is weak.  I'm just saying Wagner is the clear cut best center for the Wiz."
TIL Robin Lopez plays for the Wizards
I’d argue Robin Lopez looks like he cares he’s just way too slow lol
"Hey yo, shoutout to ROBIN LOPEZ for keepin it real and always being freaking HILARIOUS."
TIL Robin Lopez is on the Wizards
TIL Robin Lopez plays for the Wizards
"Robin Lopez has to be one of the most likable people in the NBA. He's also so real, and funny lol"
"If I had to make a list of players most likely to have eaten human flesh, Robin Lopez would be in group A"
Meanwhile a Wizards possession is a bad ball screen from robin Lopez to Russ.   Then Russ dribbling for 10 seconds.  Then another screen that Russ waves off.  Then Russ shoots a contested 3 after 5 head fakes.  CLANK.
"Unfortunately, shit hurts. Lots of young guys that are too hesitant, can't create on their own.  Beal is great but we need more defense and he needs to involve his team more to get them going. They're better with westbrook on the floor from the eye test but he's not enough to carry anyone. Definitely regressing in places. Bertans is literally only good for 3s but didn't make enough.  And holy shit they keep doing this run along side the ball carrier thing with their hands up to not foul but still somehow run into the shooter with their bodies and still commit a foul.  Robin lopez at least looks a bit better on offense but that s a minimal upgrade from where he was. Alex fuckin len, idk even know. Like 1/20 of what Steven adams is.  And yes all of this is scott brooks fault"
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
All i can say is watch the wiz. Rui bertans brown avdji matthews robin lopez are terrible. Check a few games out and assess them. Youll poke your eyes out lol. The cavs team was elite from 3 hence i give them the edge. This wiz team is a joke. Even bertans is done after getting his contract
"He also plays for a bad team he didn’t choose to play for, with a bad coach and Robin Lopez as a teammate"
"I dislike the Robin Lopez signing. However, Lopez is shooting 36 percent from 3 this season."
for players that the Nets may target?  * Javale McGee * Nerlens * PJ Tucker * LaMarcus Aldridge (longshot) * Blake Griffin (prob won't opt out) * Gorgui Dieng * Robin Lopez (most likely)
Robin Lopez is on the wizards?
"I like Deni and Rui is showing some real growth. Robin Lopez is like 90% on those weird hook/scoop shots. Neto is cool too.   Outside of that.... Bertans is the new Mahinmi, Ish is a front-rim legend, Troy Brown is proving he was a waste of a 15th pick, Westbrook turns over more than some IHOP flapjacks, and Beal might be a masochist."
Robin Lopez and Mascots. It’s strange but in a fun way
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Life advice: always act in a way as saintly as Robin Lopez believes himself to be
"Brooklyn scared they won't be able to beat the Wizards and their elite center rotation of Moe Wagner, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len"
You could have gone with 2017 Jimmy too since that was his best season before he was traded to Minnesota. 2013 Robin Lopez was also his best besides 2014.
"I don't even know why robin lopez is still there, I mean he is a decent center but that's years ago"
"I think that’s only true of both the best and most disciplined defenders *and* I don’t think leaving any NBA player “open” is a real viable strategy. I mentioned it in a previous comment but Dort obviously isn’t a shooter and he hurt them in the first round last year iirc.  You mention drop coverage but I don’t think I made it clear the PnR is happening around midrange/FT line, drop coverage would essentially give him a floater. I think teams often start playing the way you described (happy to concede the midrange) at the beginning of games and dependent on his shooting outcomes adjust whether they mean too or not.   For me it’s necessary to open up his game/floor on a bad team (which the Wizards currently are) and the positives for the Wizards offense outweigh the difference in value gained by having someone else take those shots.   Which is a whole other thing people never consider when it comes to efficiency. Efficiency is a long term metric that’s highly volatile in the short term. The difference beteeen a 35% three point shooter career and a 38% three point shooter career is minuscule over the course of any single game (dependent to difficult of shots/type of shots/attempts/etc I’m just qualifying this). I don’t get exactly who people expect Russ to give the ball to, to take these shots and not only produce as efficiently if not more so than he is. The Wizards have been terrible outside of Beal/WB. Rui hasn’t had the leap I expected (but he was injured/Covid iirc) and with Thomas Bryant out they’re playing fucking Robin Lopez at center. I don’t think the difference in the shots he’d be giving up is so great it would warrant criticism and would also require taking the ball out of his hands sometimes.   I’m not saying it’s not the best option for defenses, I’m saying it’s necessary for WB game given the roster construction and honestly with the rest of their surrounding talent I’m not sure what the expected answer is. This would be way different if Bertans was shooting like he did last year and Hachimura made a small leap, but I don’t think the options aren’t him even warrant the discussion at the moment."
 That’s the thing he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter.  The strength thing may be legit but outside of Robin Lopez he was pretty good against very other Center we played.  He knows how to defend without fouling and he can switch on the perimeter .  So maybe he’s not good enough to be the anchor of a defense but in Chicago who was the best defensive player he played next to.  Thad Young?  He isn’t Rudy Gobert but his defensive foibles are highly exaggerated because most defense in the NBA is a team scheme and he’s really really good in our team scheme.
Steven Adam’s. Robin Lopez. Drummond.  It’s reserved more for people who aren’t that good at many other things aside form being physical. Drummond might not be the best answer but he might qualify.   Embid and Zion do so many more things to get that kinda label.
[Anyone who upsets Robin Lopez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cmhNNAtP0&amp;ab_channel=BallFreakInc.)
Unrelated but Brook and Robin Lopez with over 230 mil in salary in their careers. Wow
Shaq once stared down Robin Lopez on the Suns' bench. Robin got dominated in that exchange.
FWIW the Bulls once got warned by the league because they sat Robin Lopez.
We couldn't stop Robin Lopez so not sure we have room to talk
"Wizards not named Russel Westbrook, Raul Neto, or Robin Lopez had a combined eFG% of 28.95."
"Except for Robin Lopez, who did a good Jokic impression in the post."
Wizards should play through Robin Lopez
He was out for a long time with an injury and has been working his way back.  His problem is a supreme lack of confidence. His FT% is significantly worse in the NBA than at the collegiate level and there's an obvious hitch in his shot.  There was a stretch last year where he was playing great (including that great dunk over Robin Lopez) but he just hasn't been able to keep that level up.
"He was confident for a brief moment in the league, but then Robin Lopez chased after him all the way down the court, and Culver was never the same."
The disrespect to Robin Lopez though. He has more skill than even a healthy Perk. That hook shot is lethal.
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
Remember that this is comparing to Alex Len that was 3rd string for the Raptors and was cut.  This is also comparing against Robin Lopez who barely saw the court in last few seasons backing up his bro.
"He wasn't a poor defender until 2017, he was gambling way too much but still at the very worst average.  And about the box out what do you thin, Giannis rebounding got so much ""better"" once he started playing with Brook Lopez (and even better again wth Robin Lopez) ? I've never seen anyone have a problem with that weirdly ?  Why do you think Tristan Thompson's rebounding got so much better once Lebron left ?   Were you there when Harden was on the floor during garbage time multiple games to keep his 30 points streak alive 2 years ago ?  Or when Rondo was litterally giving up 2 lay ups per game to get assists ?  Or is it just bad because it allowed Westbrook to get to 10 rebounds a game ?  And again even if he was the worst stad padder of all time which he might very well be, it's not the same at all as an empty stats guy."
"Thinking basketball discussed this last year. Bulky rim protectors like Brook Lopez are replaceable, his own brother Robin was able to sustain his impact on defense without much hassle, though it did go down by a tiny margin.  We were best when both Giannis and Brook were on the floor, but we we still the best with Giannis, and middle of the pack without him.  Impact is really subjective, Giannis does a lot of what Embiid does and more. He’s one of the best and statistically the most lethal rim protector in the league. He held opponents to 36.4% at the rim last season; Rudy Gobert and Embiid were in the high 40s"
I don’t see people calling Robin Lopez a crackhead
"If it has nothing to do with race then what features are you basing calling a crackhead from? His messy hair, his franctic play style? I don’t see people calling Robin Lopez or th McConnell crackheads. And yeah it got a little racist last year in the playoffs when people were calling Pat Bev a crackhead and trezz a gorilla in a vitriolic way"
"All you did was throw out a bunch of teams and names and didn’t even check if the money works lol. The only one that remotely makes sense and makes the money work out is the celtics offering their entire TPE and their 2 picks for Aldridge.   Zeller does not make nearly enough to match salaries.  Bledsoe does not make nearly enough to match salaries. Steven Adams cannot be traded this year bc he signed an extensions after august 6th. The Knicks “fillers that they just waived” make nowhere near enough to match salaries.  Robin Lopez doesn’t make nearly enough to match salaries &amp; “filler” is not a player nor a contract, it’s just a bail out answer.  Again, “filler” doesn’t play for the Mavericks and doesn’t make $24 million.   So, just to recap, you mentioned “plenty of teams” and offered one legitimate answer. I guess that’s enough, smartass."
Best I can do is a slightly used Robin Lopez
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
They could sign Robin Lopez too.  Roll with three Antetounmkpko's and a couple Lopez's.   That's a full house I think.
"Bulls won a game with Walt Lemon, Wayne Selden, Shaq Harrison, Timonthe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Robin Lopez"
"If Brook Lopez married Robin Lopez, that would be considered incest."
"Perk doesn't belong there. Ron Artest, Bill Laimbeer, Larry Johnson, Anthony Mason, Robert Parrish, Karl Malone, James Johnson, Matt Barnes, Zach Randolph, David West, Robin Lopez, Udonis Haslem, Steven Adams above Kendrick Perkins. Perk is just mean mug dude. Steven Adams is more of an enforcer than Perk will ever be even if he doesn't do the ugly mean mug like Perk did."
Robin Lopez drying his tears.
Robin Lopez was alright but yeah nobody else really.
Robin Lopez had 16/10 off the bench
"what the fuck, robin lopez looking like kareem out here"
"I think you are rating 83-year-old Jack Nicholson a bit high, but I love the fact that you included him and Spike Lee on the chart!  I also agree that Bennie the Bull would be a handful.  You should send this to Robin Lopez and see what he thinks!  Edit: Damn, the mods are no fun.  I guess you can save this for the offseason."
bullying Robin Lopez lul
"21 assist with guys like Alex Len, Jerome Robinson, Robin Lopez, Chandler Hutchinson lol"
"I think at this stage of his career blake's legs are shot and he needs to be spoon fed dunk opportunities. His first dunk was a blow by against cement footed robin lopez, with zero help d behind. Blake was given a free line to the basket. His second dunk was the result of the entire defense collapsing on harden and blake being wide open off the cut.   The blake pistons never had a harden type player to create these kinds of looks, and never had the spacing that the nets have."
"Is Gasol still an effective defender?  Because Drummond really isn’t, he’d let guys like Robin Lopez dominate him."
"Why do people think he’s washed? His very last game he played for Houston he went 6/12   Stat line 19/8/4 with 2 steals and 2 blocks... He came off a full season off an ACL injury. Takes time to get back into the swing of things. They are sooooo many garbage centres out there that are a 100 times worse then him. Aron Baynes, Robin Lopez, and many others.   Houston’s record this year was largely due to Oladipo and Wall doing the Kawhi move of sitting out back to backs. They barely had games where they even played together because of it. Then, Woods gets injured and what does Houston do? Buyout Boogie and leave them with nobody to crash the boards. They’re idiots.   I really hope this man gets his chance again and makes people eat their words."
Completely ridiculous.  He made Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez return to the Bulls.   They said they wanted to develop the young guys.
The year of the Luka Draft Silver sent out a warning to teams that were testing places. Silver told the Bulls they couldn’t rest Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday and Dallas couldn’t rest Harrison Barnes. I think the frustration has to do with not being enforced the same from team to team
The year of the Doncic Tank Adam Silver sent a warning to the Bulls for benching for a couple of games Robin Freaking Lopez. Glad to see the rules are equal for everyone. What a joke
Rebounds are really 80% down to team effort. For instance with Robin Lopez next to him Lauri was able to average 9 rebounds in his 2nd season because Lopez was boxing out the opponent's best rebounder which helped Lauri to get the ball. Individual rebounding stats should always come with an asterisk. Offensive rebounds are more down to pure ability to fight for the possession. In defense your team usually has the upper hand due to court positions.
How do you have Robin Lopez in there but not Gorgui Dieng?
1.	Gobert 2.	jokic 3.	KAT 4.	Thaddeus young 5.	robin lopez 6.	embiid
PG: Jokic  SG : Joe Ingles  SF: Giannis  PF: Embiid  C: Robin Lopez  Coach: Richard Jefferson
Fun fact: Brook and Robin Lopez were also named after words
Pretty sure I read that Robin Lopez has the most made hook shots this season.
I did not realise they had Robin Lopez starting this whole time wtf.
Robin Lopez was also a bizarrely effective matchup on Jokic lol
He kept trying to make Robin Lopez guarding Bobby Portis happen..he did it Saturday too. Just a blatant mismatch.
I think Robin Lopez might be one of the most useless players in the league. How is he still playing?
"Doncic, Jokic, Robin Lopez"
Prime Robin Lopez?
Yes. All the great passers in nba history have had high turnover rates and raw turnover numbers his are a bit too high right now but will positively regress down to just bottom-5 territory. He also plays with robin “hands of plaster” lopez and a bunch of young dudes who don’t know what ‘open’ is in the nba and as such are not expecting the ball in prime dime situation. As for the handles he’s never been exceptionally tight with them but as his finishing continues to improves and defenders back farther off of him I expect the live ball dribbling turnovers to positively regress too.
2019 Bulls with Robin Lopez
A couple of seasons ago the Bulls started a lineup of:  PG- Walt Lemon Jr  SG- Rawle Alkins  SF- Wayne Selden  PF- Shaq Harrison  C- Robin Lopez  Who ya got?
Are you implying Robin Lopez is white? lol
Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez is getting abused lol
Robin Lopez hustle is a thing of beauty.
"I'm annoyed because it's complete bullshit at worst and lazy parroting at best.  1.  I don't think he's the worst defender in the league - that's just nonsense that /r/nba  says to drag him, but you know what, I'll let you have this.  Trae is the worst defender in the league. 2.  has tunnel vision - kid that averages 9 assists a game - with tunnel vision. Of course.  Perfect match for Trae.  Well done.  Tunnel vision assists! 3.  But you said remove the playmaking - only one of his primary attributes - of course, easily done.  Rudy Gobert without his defense is still the exact same player more or less, after all.  Let's look at some more criteria now:  &gt;He doesn't really do much besides shoot giving you 1 assist and 2 rebounds.   1.  2 rebounds is the same as 4 rebounds right?  So what if Trae at 6'1 is averaging more rebounds than david bertans, or marc gasol, or robin lopez, or danny green, or duncan robinson. 4 rebounds is basically 0 rebounds if you round down.  Another perfect match for Trae.  Great job.  2.  doesn't really do much besides shoot - of course, if you take away a point guard's playmaking, all he can do is shoot. You've just described all of the league's point guards.  Trae's one of all the league's point guards!  well done again.  another criteria met.  ​  76% of Duncan Robinson's shots are 3s, compared to Young's 38%.  He's 6'7, and averages 3 rebounds and 1.2 assists ​and is also a terrible defender.  You don't have to change a damn thing and he fits the criteria almost perfectly.   So by your logic, trae young, if you remove his playmaking, is duncan robinson.    You literally just focused on one thing - worst defender - then lazily tried to shoehorn Trae Young into the rest of the description based on that one bit of circlejerk nonsense."
"Drummond hate has got to the point where he’s seriously underrated IMO. He’s not a max player but he’s certainly no worse than Adams or Cody zeller. Adams just got a 17mil extension, Robin Lopez got 7mil ffs. I think he’s worth 12-15mil a year at min"
"Robin Lopez, all teams since 2012"
"Robin Lopez, Channing Frye, Enes Kanter before his return"
"Joel ""the thrilla"" Pryzbilla is a Portland cult hero. Others are Robin Lopez, Enes Kanter before this season, and Steve Blake"
And now they're saying [it's Robin Lopez](https://i.imgur.com/0jqzjnr.jpg)
Because we can't have 2 Robin Lopez running around
He's legit been great with us. Huge step above Robin Lopez and Alex Len.
They have him as the 3rd center behind alex Len and robin lopez lol
Anyone who doesn’t think floor raisers are a real thing should watch 1 minute of Ish Smith trying to feed Robin Lopez posting and re-posting for 24 whole seconds.
"This sounds about right  Celts needed a legit size center.  Its hard to believe, couldnt even find a Robin Lopez   Also Fournier was a decent find. But a little too late  Celts have depth but most are useless and ineffective"
Lamelo is a more athletic Luka. Luka is a shorter Jokic. Jokic is a Brook Lopez with passing. Brook Lopez is a Robin Lopez that's not crazy. Robin Lopez is Damian Jones with a hook shot. So basically Lamelo is Damian Jones with some non essential addons
Because if he gets hot it kills the game. Takes so many more shots with floaters.  He just had 13 free throws which was the problem.  It's like Robin Lopez scoring 20 doesn't kill you
don’t forget box-out-per-36 king Robin Lopez.
Robin Lopez
and he (22 years old) is gonna have less minutes than robin lopez (33) and alex len (27) for some reason
"That does sort of matter in certain situations though. A random example off the top of my head is when Robin Lopez and Serge Ibaka got into a fight a couple years back. There were clear punches thrown but no damage was done - not even sure a punch was landed - so they each got like 2 games or something. But if Ibaka’s punch landed and knocked out Lopez then the punishment would’ve been much more severe.  I guess it doesn’t matter in the context of flagrant fouls, but where the punch lands does matter when it comes to suspensions"
"I agree with you especially because Charlotte is a weird team, they switch a ton, they play small, they play zone, that's the kind of team against whom having a coach is nice.  Like I could see Brooks beign caught with Robin Lopez in a drop against PJ Washington poping at the 3pts line"
The Bulls did the exact same thing four years ago and instead of getting Luka we got Wendell Carter Jr because Silver forced the Bulls to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday.
Imagine if we had thomas bryant instead of alex len or robin lopez lol.
"Hes not carrying Robin Lopez, Neto, Bertans, Len, and Mathews Im sorry but idk how Russ and Beal have been able to carry that sorry ass supporting cast. Credit to them though but they both have to play for them to have a chance. For real that supporting cast is putrid."
Robin Lopez leaving his fist hanging there for like 5 seconds lol
Robin Lopez?
Why’s that? The way I see it any second the ball is not in 5.74 40 time robin Lopez’ here is a second Westbrook can push it down the throat of the defense.
"Duncan Robinson talks about Robin Lopez trash talking. During the bubble, RoLo was on the sideline of a game sitting on the baseline watching some dude hit his FT’s. After one shot, in a silent gym, Robin says with force and clarity... &gt;*”This league is full of theatrics and thespians. Some of you are worthy of Oscar level performances for what you’ve done tonight. All of you should be embarrassed... all of you... embarrassed.”*"
Damn he’s really holding the Cs back. Let us take him off your hands for Robin Lopez and a 2nd rounder.
"Robin ""Captain Hook"" Lopez dropped 24 last night so his brother responds with his own 24, love to see it."
"lmao love Brook Lopez man, funniest guy in the league (along with Robin Lopez ofcourse)"
I’d rather see the games end with actual basketball plays and not intentional fouls as robin lopez and pascal siakam trade free throws. Maybe I’m crazy
Scott Brooks gonna hold onto this Robin Lopez performance for a while
"He’s still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he’s a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can’t do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to “they want to speed up the pace.” That’s true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
Robin Lopez is the best center in the league and should be MVP don't @ me.
Insert a gif of Robin Lopez shoving the raptor mascot here.
Robin Lopez doesn't look like a real person is probably why
"Lmaooooo y’all lost to us when Beal was playing like trash, Russ fouled out and Siakam had 40+ and was getting whatever he wanted??? That was the makings of a SoWiz game and by the grace of Robin Lopez and Raul Neto we won that shit lol"
"Tampa bay can suck my sweaty nuts, if we are stuck playing there one more year I’m going to run my head through a wall.   Also, someone needs to get Robin Lopez some help."
"Robin Lopez really Captain Hooked them, didn’t he"
Fuck Robin Lopez. Dude played great but legit got away with murder all game. He’s got some dirt on the refs for sure. That being said Westbrook got shafted hard all night lol. Overall some of the worst officiating of the season
"Robin Lopez really Captain Hooked them, didn’t he"
"Should Robin Lopez be in the MVP conversation? Also, Russell Westbrook could tie Oscar Saturday"
Is Robin Lopez the new MVP? Also Russ is just one away from tying the triple double record
"thats gotta be a charge lol. Also somehow, someway, robin lopez is the clutchest player in the game"
"I'm worried about their match up with the Hornets. They are better but the Hornets play a lot of zone defense, play small, switch a lot, they are a weird team, which could be effective against a Scott Brooks' coached team, I could easily see PJ Washington go off from 3 because Brooks lets Robin Lopez guard him or something weird like that"
I don’t even know what to say to this. Like why not just give him starter minutes. Why is robin lopez getting more minutes. Gafford has been killing it since he got here and has been a huge part of our recent success. Yet brooks refuses to acknowledge it and reward him with more minutes
&gt;Robin Lopez and Alex Len are not better rebounding centers.  No they are not but they were better against Brook Lopez tonight.  &gt;If we don't play Gafford in those last seven minutes we don't even have a chance to win the game.  You were lucky because Brook had his 5th foul and was benched. Otherwise he would've dominated Gafford.
Robin Lopez and Alex Len are not better rebounding centers. If we don't play Gafford in those last seven minutes we don't even have a chance to win the game.
Think this is the first time since the trade Robin Lopez and Bango have shared a stadium. Hope things don't get ugly.
Sounds like Robin Lopez.
100% lol And Robin Lopez and Len
"Statistically his first 19 games don't look that bad but it's more how he played, which goes to show how wonky box score stats and our current state of analytics are.  He looked noticeably out of whack on court - didn't seem as explosive, wasn't as big a threat to blow up the rim, and looked out of sorts on his passes. Even his assists looked sketchy with a lot of off-target passes and fumbled shots.  When he came back after Covid break he looked way more like himself - he started exploding to the rim again and defenses had to play him different. His passes were more on point, more of his turnovers started being the fault of the recipient (ie. Robin slippery-hands Lopez) and he seemed way more in command of the game. Statistically it looked like a marginal improvement, but you could just tell, visually."
Draymond's defense on Jokic was great as well. I also think Robin Lopez played him very well earlier in the season.
He would have more even robin Lopez didn’t have hands made of stone
3 of those came from Robin Lopez fumbling the pass
"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
"He is underrated i would take him before Baynes, Robin Lopez, Tristan Thompson"
"&gt;No, AD has dominated at the 5 his whole career.  No, he hasn't.  Per basketball-reference's position estimates, which are not perfect, Davis' percentage of time at the center position:  |Year|Pct at Center| :--|:--| |2013|39| |2014|47| |2015|36| |2016|54| |2017|64| |2018|51| |2019|96| |2020|40| |2021|11|  Of note, as soon as New Orleans made Davis their nearly full-time center, he left.  Previous to that, the Pelicans always played a bigger, stronger guy alongside Davis much of the time.  Guys like Robin Lopez, Jason Smith, Greg Stiemsma, Omer Asik, Alexis Ajinca, DeMarcus Cousins, and Nikola Mirotic.  &gt;Frank will play him there whether he, we like it or not in the playoffs.  Vogel might.  And Davis might react like he did in New Orleans, and say ""Fuck this."""
Bulls got forced to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday costing us Luka
If im the wizards I ran far more of that lol. Do you know how much easier it would be for russ and beal if they ran a 5 out offense? Spacing is the name of the game not having a guy like robin lopez or alex len in at the final moments. Granted I really like Gafford but it is incredibly hard for russ and beal to do what they do best when bigs are clogging the paint like theyve done all season. Why do you think russ's efficiency/scoring is down this season?
"FWIW, the league has previously threatened to punish teams that sat healthy players at least once (the Bulls in 2018 got warned for resting Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday).  I guess the league doesn't really care anymore."
Could have Robin Lopez doing it instead
Scalabrini  Boban  Robin Lopez beating up a mascot
Robin Lopez in shambles
We need at least one more Wizards v Cavs game so Varejao can face off against Robin Lopez to see who looks more like Sideshow Bob while getting postered.
Robin Lopez &amp; Sideshow Bob  Jaxson Hayes &amp; Sideshow Bob   Or maybe I just have a thing for Sideshow Bob
"It wasn’t as big with Milwaukee though, guys like Lopez bros(was Robin Lopez getting minutes? I cant remember), Dante, Korver, Wes etc. we’re getting rotation minutes. LA had arguably two of the best athletes in the league in their front court in Bron and AD, and they had pretty good athletes in Kuzma, Caruso, KCP and even DG as the role players.    The thing is that you cant view the series in terms of how many games it went, i think you have to look at in terms of like “ when the lakers are playing at their best, how did the heat fare?” because if dragic played then lakers would have to take it up a notch.  This isn’t to say that LA wasn’t taking it seriously, but more so that its just in a team’s nature to play down to the level of the competition sometimes. The warriors lost 2 games to the Lou Will clippers because of that, but when they locked in it was clear that there was a sever talent disparity. If the warriors faced the current clippers, it would probably be over in 6 but i wouldn’t say both series presents equal challenges despite the same outcome"
Actually Robin Lopez started and Frye came off the bench
"Robin Lopez was the starting Center for that team. Frye was part of the incredible bench team with Dragic, Barbosa, Dudley, and Amundson."
You can’t mention the 09-10 Suns and not mention LOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUU  A rookie Robin Lopez was actually a very important x-factor for that team as well and he’s still in the league.
"They were 25/47 last year and are 28/34 this season, despite their 2nd best player from last year being out of shape half the season (Bertans), their 3rd best player being out all year basically (Bryant, not sure he was really that good tho) and them having to alternate between a rookie (Avdija),a two way player (Mathews) and a 6'0 guard (Neto) as their 5th starter.  But hey I guess they are better because of the addition of Robin Lopez"
Yep. Both the Lopez are smart defenders but it seems this year especially their bodies are finally slowing down. Hope they feel more rejuvenated after this season. Brook and Robin must be sore from the Bubble and now this jam packed season. Tough on the 7 footers
"Don't forget Boris Diaw, current Nets GM Sean Marks, Grant Hill, Matt Barnes, Robin Lopez, Goran Dragic, Jared Dudley, Channing Frye, James Jones, Jalen Rose, Kurt Thomas etc.   Those Suns teams had role players for days."
"that's why you always see, in every game, centers throwing outlet passes to driving point guards for easy baskets  it's only westbrook who STEALS those rebounds because he hates his teammates, just so Len doesn't average 8 APG, out of spite!  it has nothing to do with the fact that centers aren't trained to pass the ball over long ranges, and it's only because russ is so brain dead stupid and/or insanely jealous that he absolutely refuses to let robin lopez throw pinpoint 80 ft passes even though he's as good as every other center in the league at it"
I disagree the year Luka was entering the draft Adam Silver was sending memos to the Bulls telling them to not rest Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday. The NBA isnt consistent and doesnt care if small market teams do it
Wizards dress Robin Lopez more or less as the muscle.
"I think this is a good discussion but it’s tough to just not list all the 6th men. Their job is to provide offense off the bench generally.   To exclude them would be better because we could focus on the intangibles. Smart, anunoby, capela, robin lopez, pat bev,  these people have a fairly defined role."
"What's funny is the best highlight for the wizards isn't even posted -- it was when Robin Lopez blocked THT's dunk attempt. Couldn't believe there wasn't even a reply. At least that was clean, unlike this offensive foul."
"Len has been on a tear lately. Robin Lopez, Len, and Gafford have been way better than expected"
"It's impossible to hate Robin Lopez - I will die on that hill, he is just so weird and lovable"
Robin Lopez can’t stop trezz lmao
"As far as the talent in big man goes, Robin Lopez is right up there with Drummond. Nothing he does looks deliberate."
"i realize it's pointless to talk to you because you literally have no idea what you're talking about. Adams and Kanter are the players you say were solid enough to beat the Rockets? Jesus dude. Regardless of anything else, regurgitating opinions other people who don't actually watch basketball games, is _not_ the same as making a cogent point yourself.  &gt; but the thing is westbrook playstyle just doesnt make his teammates better.  this, by far, is the stupidest thing haters say about westbrook. criticize his game all you want, some of it is even fair - you're right that Russ shouldn't get a free pass for his poor play in the Jazz series - but saying INSANELY STUPID shit like this makes it clear that you are simply a hater.  PG13 was an MVP candidate next to Westbrook. Robin Lopez is having literally the best year of his career. Beal is on track to win scoring champion. Oladipo directly credited Westbrook for his improvement. but it doesn't actually matter what westbrook does or doesn't do, you will find something to criticize him, regardless of whether its real or not.  see that's the thing about haters. they will say **anything** to put Russ down, and it makes it impossible to have an actual conversation with people like you."
"Watch the national games.  For comedy and entertainment watch Inside the NBA on TNT.  If you see a game coming up with a great player, watch it.  You'll catch nuggets of wisdom on why they are great from the better announcers.  You will also see at least a couple of spectacular plays every game where you wonder how they managed to do it.  Watch for the players, coaches, and owners that interest you since we don't have a team in Seattle currently.  I personally like watching the Spurs because of Coach Popovich.  I like Coach McMillan's defensive coaching, and he's Mr. Sonic so I'll watch if he's coaching a game.  I'll sometimes turn on a Mavericks game because Mark Cuban is interesting.  If I see Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron, Curry, Damian Lillard, Harden, or some other great I'll stop and watch it.  Heck I'll even turn on Sabonis because I like his dad or Robin Lopez to watch his hook shot."
I tuned in late and I thought Gafford fouled out.  Seriously what the fuck is this man doing? It’s so obvious he’s our best center but he only gets 15 minutes? Last game he only closed out the game because Robin Lopez got hurt when he should have been the one out there in the first place.  I feel like i’m going crazy watching these rotations
"I'd fail with the Morris twins.  To answer your question, Robin Lopez would be very recognizable."
"Come on guys, I'm like 67% sure Seth just thought that's how Giannis likes to be greeted after watching hours of his Robin Lopez pregame tik toks. Just a big ol' misunderstanding."
"he’s a fake starter. He only averages 15mpg. Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford are the ones I’d give the credit to for their C position, especially over this run"
"The wizards are absolutely worse than every team theyve played this season. There is not a more terribly constructed roster in the league this season. The only reason they win games, is because of westbrook/beal. They dont even have a decent ball handler besides those two. Injuries have kept their best shooter out of many games, and until gafford came, they were relying on robin mf Lopez. Please stop tryna bring down russ, the man is carrying the shit out of the wizards."
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
"The truly funny thing about this is that both Craig and Thompson are just such extremely mediocre role player caliber guys. Sure Thompson is a little bit higher up on the hierarchy of NBA players than Craig, but its about the same as comparing two guys like Tony Snell and Robin Lopez against each other."
Shoutout Robin Lopez for being a one man defense
"Robin Lopez has naturally curly hair that can grow down to his shoulders, has the ability to grow an insanely long beard, and has strong facial features. Yet somehow he chooses the absolute worst style imagineable and looks awful. Dude would look sick with a decent cut and a beard."
robin lopez is not a playable center in the nba and if people go cold brooks is completely unwilling to take people out and adjust.
"Robin Lopez and the mascots, except it ends in a brawl."
"I think you have a good shot in this next game. Warriors have only Looney and Draymond at center right now. Embiid gave them both absolute beatings in this game, Robin Lopez is another bruiser who is way bigger than them both next up on the schedule, and then they have Jokic. I think they'll be wearing down by the time they get there unless maybe Paschall comes back and can absorb some of the punishment.  Criminal negligence by the Warrior front office not to sign a starting quality center to this team and entrusting the position to a high school center."
~~Robin Lopez~~
Robin Lopez hook shots
He kinda looks like robin lopez now
Brook and Robin Lopez. There’s no other answer
"Portis, Forbes, Teague, Tucker is a way better supporting cast than Hill, Matthews, Ersan and Robin Lopez. The corpse of Kyle Korver really shouldn’t count. Not sure how people are still hung up on this “Bucks lost depth” thing."
the horford thing is so silly considering how they went as us for... robin lopez and justin holiday a few years back
"Yes on the defensive end, although right now Robin Lopez is playing much better than when he started the season- thanks to his hook shot he is shooting 76.6% from the field during this 7 game stretch and averaging 11.1 ppg in 19 minutes per game."
"The team missed 13 days because of COVID , have multiple players injured and were starting Robin Lopez for a period of time.   I'll take 22-33."
The bulls got fined for resting Robin fucking lopez in 2018
Robin Lopez has been automatic from the hook shot for awhile now
Robin Lopez hook shot
"Why would you use Robin Lopez as an example lol? What about Jokic? Embiid? Vucevic? Sabonis? Valanciunas? We still have tons of efficient back to the basket post up players. Allstars, MVP candidates and number one seeds that plays primarily from the post."
"You could have signed someone like Robin Lopez for a fraction of the money, less years, and not given away picks.    And just because you have the picks to get off his salary doesn't make it a good move.  So now they are gonna be sending picks to acquire him and then to get off his contract."
"Definitely top 10, he’s really challenging Robin Lopez for best player in the nba right now"
"Did they really have Shamet on Robin Lopez , and NOT pass him the ball for a post up?"
Robin Lopez has a better shot than Simmons. Let that sink in
"Dudes a 6’11” athletic monster, might as well ask why Robin Lopez, Gobert or Drummond hasn’t improved their shot. Just because Simmons can move, dribble and pass like a guard doesn’t mean he should be held to the same shooting standards as other point guards."
"He's also the father of 2 current NBA starters, the only other one that I can name. Robin (Lopez) is not a starter anymore. So the Heriberto posts have stopped being a daily thing."
"Brook Lopez (and Robin) when I heard his first interview when he got into the league but now that he's been around for awhile, everyone is used to it."
"Head to head isn’t an entirely good way to tell cause it’s not like he scored all those points on just Lopez. From what I’ve watched from sixers bucks games embiid has done pretty well against Lopez in some games and not so good in others while absolutely killing the bucks backups (particularly robin Lopez when he was there, he owns robin Lopez lol)"
Robin Lopez
No one asked for this but here are some nicknames I have given to players:  - Robin Lopez: Caveman - Brook Lopez: Cavebrother - PJ Tucker: Uncle Tuck - Cauley-Stein: Prison Fresh - Jrue Holiday: Lil’ Yachty
Robin lopez
Robin lopez guarded him for like 5 possessions I wouldn't read into it.   Most of those dominant games he was making jump shots the same ones he's missing vs Ayton
"Idk if I’d say Rudy is second, Jokic has some of his most dominant games this year against the jazz. Tbh Robin Lopez is the only guy other than Ayton who has really seemed to frustrate joker"
Jokic shades of..... ROBIN LOPEZ
Robin Lopez is still dominating the NBA
I have liked Robin Lopez for the Wiz shooting FTs this year because make or miss he gets that shot off quick as hell. Either way he’s moving the game along.
"Clippers need to get a defensive big, a Robin Lopez or Nerlens Noel so they can actually implement their switch defense. But idk what they can do about PG, he is who he is."
I don't watch a lot of Bucks games. Is Robin Lopez always that good defensively? He was an absolute monster in the 4th.
Robin Lopez
Turner and Robin Lopez is the winning combo
Robin Lopez approves this sentiment
So...Robin Lopez?
True. He’s no Robin “Kareem” Lopez.
You’re thinking of George Lopez. Robin Lopez is an MVP
Totally agree Robin Lopez deserves a title
The Greivis Vásquez/Ryan Anderson/Robin Lopez trio probably isn't winning many games that season if Davis is on the Kentucky team instead of New Orleans.
lol we tried that for a minute with the Knicks and it wasn't great. His best compliment at C in his time here was probably Robin Lopez.
&gt;So your solution is to have robin lopez go over screens lmao?   Thankfully you can take players out of lineups and change them. Giannis can play at the 5.
So your solution is to have robin lopez go over screens lmao? That's why they're down 30 going into the 4th and only have 65 points?
Bucks for Brook Lopez. Wizards for Robin Lopez.
"Dude, it isn't 1980.  There's literally one guy in the entire league who shoots a hook shot--Robin Lopez.  There's literally one guy in the league who shoots more than 6 shots per game out of post-ups--Embiid.  There's only one other guy in the league who really lives in the post--Jokic, but for the purpose of facilitating.  So you're just wrong.  If it were so easy to ""get a hook shot"", then more guys would do it."
"It's actually insane when you think about how many Centers are not American.   Embiid, Jokic, Vuc, Ayton, Theis, Ibaka, Gasol, Nurkic, KAT (will probably play for DR), Capela, Tingus Pingus,   The US may really have to go with Robin Lopez or Drummond of McGee at the 5. Although if Bam wants to play that would save us."
"Robin Lopez had his best year ever, what are you talking about?? jfc you sound moronic"
so glad the legend of robin lopez dad dicking opponents with nothing but hook shots is still alive and well
"Zach Collins, Robin Lopez and Markief Morris? Yikes"
Ask Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez will be the Professor for the History of Magical Creatures and by Creatures I mean Mascots
Robin Lopez of course
This was scheduled to be done until Robin Lopez ate the sorting hat.
"Maybe Robin Lopez, not sure if he'd come on the cheap though."
Kyle Anderson and Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez hook shot
and Giannis for Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez looks great out there
"You're probably thinking of Robin Lopez, easy to get them mixed up"
Robin Lopez is Zapdos and Brook Lopez is Articuno.
robin lopez drops 38 in a loss
Robin Lopez
He's no Robin Lopez so yes
"Yes I would take him over Robin Lopez, and yes, I am a very sad person"
Robin Lopez took it from Kobe smh
Robin Lopez would never...
The goat conversation was over that day Robin Lopez first picked up a basketball
Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
Ayton and Capella are the only 2 who play really well against Jokic imo. Edit: also Robin Lopez i guess lmao
And LeBron. Would be great support cast for Robin ‘Sky Hook Fucker’ Lopez for sure.
I don't know what the sixers could possibly offer even though he would be a perfect fit. Would have to be like Tobias/Maxey/1st? for Beal and Robin Lopez for salary matching. Washington could flip tobias for picks/young players.
Obviously gotta feed Robin Lopez
Just base your game off Robin Lopez and constantly hit them with the hook shot
Robin Lopez is sideshow bob.
Brook Lopez is good and Robin Lopez is pure evil
What is this post lmao. Jerome Robinson isn’t even on the team anymore. Robin Lopez was most certainly a quality vet. And bringing in some 34 year old players is not gonna help us at all lmao. And why on EARTH would we trade for Horford?? Like what??? Especially trading Bryant and Deni like what??
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
It’s just weird to gloat about lockdown defense on Gafford and robin lopez
you haven’t heard of robin lopez?
Crazy that the two best players in the NBA (Tyrese Maxey and Robin Lopez) have to face off in the first round.
Robin Lopez looks like he’s permanently completing a stealth mission and has to crouch run.
Robin Lopez waist down looks like a middle aged dad going to play softball
"Absolutely. Raul Neto, Davis Bertrans, and Robin Lopez are the best big three in the league right now. Oh yeah they also have Beal and Westbrook."
when Lillard in on the floor: it's dame time  when Robin Lopez is on the floor: it's hook time!
"Because when you have next in line of succession to the throne, Robin Lopez, on your team, you can take a back seat and not prioritize shooting."
It wasn’t even a dunk attempt. The problem is he’s so self absorbed and thinks he’s so great that someone as stupid as robin lopez couldn’t block him but he was wrong. He was a victim of his own hubris.
"This is somewhat inaccurate. Embiid in his rookie was by far the worst lander. Every single landing I could feel it in my knees and ankles, probably took at least a year or two off of his career in that season alone.   Over the last few seasons and now, he’s gotten SO much better at landing. If he’s under his own control, he almost rolls or lands softly. It’s when he takes these unexpected hits on the few plays where he goes all out that he takes these nasty falls. Lebron’s shove mid season (dirty af) and now Robin Lopez attempted block on that dunk. Very frustrating but fingers crossed for a quick recovery."
"Robin Lopez is awesome too, dude mas mastered the ""drunken boxing"" basketball style"
"&gt;If AD has the same injury, he's gonna turn into Robin Lopez  People were saying similar things about Durant"
"KD is an elite scorer lol. If AD has the same injury, he's gonna turn into Robin Lopez."
Between him and robin lopez
Wait for Robin Lopez.
Robin Lopez with Embiid out will get close
I’m thinking Robin Lopez.
Robin Lopez
Aint no Robin Lopez hook
If Robin Lopez turns into Kareem
"The 14-15 Blazers were actually really good. Robin Lopez, Aldridge, Batum, Matthews, and Lillard. Matthews achilles injury killed their momentum unfortunately. CJ was in year 2 and ready to break out too."
"Dame, CJ, Barton, LMA, Nurkic with Roy, Melo, Robin Lopez, and Seth Curry off the bench.  That's my usual lineup with 2k My league, a place where our trailblazers dreams still can come true."
Robin Kareem Lopez
"Why is no one giving the Lopez brothers credit? First Brook going 11-15 FG scoring 25 points in 28 minutes, carrying the Bucks and sweeping the heat, and now Robin going 8-11 getting 16 points in 19 minutes. Lopez brothers are underrated asf."
"Robin Lopez hookshots and skyhooks. Lot of them! He can't miss. So many hookshots that Embiid, Simmons, and company can't keep up. Then Westbrook, Beal, and Hachimura start hitting lots of hookshots. It's pandemonium. Is Scott Brooks actually a wizard for real? A fan runs onto the court, the security guard misses a tackle, the fan gets off a shot in the final seconds of the 4th quarter. The shot is good, but does it count? Have the Wizards won Game 7? Yes! They have! The fan was Russell Westbrook disguised as a fan!"
Game wouldn't have been so close if they kept feeding ~~Robin Lopez~~ Kareem
robin lopez born trhe same day kareem abdul jbaar died... coincydince??🤔
Robin Lopez got a sweet hook
Never thought I’d be saying I wish Porzingis had a shot like Robin Lopez but here we are.
"Given that a lot of people want someone who dropped a few pieces of popcorn thrown in jail, I’d assume if Robin Lopez clotheslined someone many would be asking for the death penalty"
Robin Lopez specifically should be allowed to do this
If Robin Lopez turns into Shaq
Because how else is he supposed to statpad rebounds when Robin Lopez is sinking every one of his drunken skyhooks?
Were you watching the game? Russ was 3-19. An inability to stop Russ and Beal was not the problem. Neither of them played well and you still lost. The problem is without Embiid you aren't that good. You were getting carried by role players and got beaten by Rui Hachimura and Robin Lopez.
"This thread took forever to come up.  Fantastic game and superb hustle from both teams. Fucking Korkmaz and Maxey were electric off the bench but I absolutely loved the hustle the Wizards show.  Westbrook without the MVP for this game, good lord. You wouldn't know how well he played based off the box score but this man played hard from start to finish. Kept defenses honest when he could and absolutely set up his teammates.  Rui probably played the best game of his career.   And Robin Lopez doing his best Abdul Jabar impression with those fucking hooks.  Good game all around. That being said, if we had Embiid and Simmons from all the way through, this game probably wouldn't have been close. All credit to the Wizards nonetheless."
Lol it was during the game where he swung on Robin Lopez and we broke our 11 game losing streak vs the Bulls
"Nah, KPs rim-protection numbers were among the best in the league while he was in NY. He wasn't just a shot-blocker.   Our defense were always average even when the personal around KP was pretty awful. Sure, Robin Lopez and corpse of Noah were decent, but guards and wings were awful every year he was with us.  In 17-18, the final season, our starting 5 was, Jarrett Jack, THj, Courtney Lee, KP and Kanter.. Our defense was ranked 16th before KP went down. After his ACL we were 29th.   He was insanely quick for his size and could cover a ton of ground even when he got beat.   I'm gonna die on this hill, but his offense was always overrated while defensively he was really good right from the get go.   And yeah, advanced stats also always loved him on defense. I remember when 538 DRAYMOND came out, they even had him as the most underrated defender in the league: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/"
"For sure the FO made a poor move in moving on from brogdon. Well moving on from him was fine, but severely underestimating the value in his contract was not. He was worth way more than what we got for him. The bucks used the money saved from brogdon to resign Hill, sign Robin Lopez and Wes Matthews. In the regular season, you can argue those 3 were more valuable than brogdon (because of what they added to the team). In the playoffs, depth means much less and thus brogdon would have been better and for sure a better trade chip. The FO looked as brogdon from a monetary standpoint and not from a player value standpoint and that was the issue."
"Robin Lopez with Klays shooting, best player by far 😎"
I’d be happy if he could develop a hook shot like Robin Lopez.
robin lopez hook is not in the same league as kareem hook   kareem could consisntently shot that at Like 50% in big volume   kobe Bryant couldnt hit mid range jumpers at that clip
"If Robin Lopez can develop a good hook shot in 2 years, I think Giannis could!"
I mean Robin lopez is a hook shot wizard and rarely gets blocked
No Robin Lopez?  What the fuck?
"&gt;Lopez is not a better scorer than Olynk, I don’t see how anyone is gonna argue this. There’s a fucking reason teams don’t have him shooting 12 hook shots a game.  Theres also a fucking reason it took almost a decade for Kelly Olynyk to take 12 shots a game, and that's because it leads to losing basketball. Literally 29 other teams wouldn't allow it, congrats he found the #1.  You're coming soooo close to my point and still not getting it. If Robin Lopez averaged 12 shots a game the team would suck ass. Yes. You've gotten that point. Guess what happened when a team let Kelly Olynyk average 12 shots/game? Worst ORtg in the league.  **Its the same concept** we just saw one where the situation actually occurred. And it led to a predictably terrible product.  No decent team is actually gonna give him a decent contract based on his scoring because its not actually scalable - its just based on opportunity.   &gt;What you said about Olynk never averaging 10 PPG is objectively wrong as well.   I said never averaging more, and you're right I missed that he once averaged 11.5. Wowee!!  Frank Kaminsky is a better scorer for Robin Lopez too, but good thing we dont just judge value based on scoring especially from a career backup C."
"&gt; Robin Lopez is not a better scorer than Olynk right now, there’s just no argument there. None. He’s also 3 years older, which is considerable.  Because no one is giving these guys the opportunity. I actually watched both of them play, and I can say I'd rather have Lopez's rim defense than Olynyk's shooting any day. And yes I believe Lopez could be a high teens PPG player if given the opportunity to shoot 12 hook shots per game and got to play 31.1 mpg  And I think theres an argument for Ibaka being as good if not better than Olynyk as a scorer. Olynyk has never scored more than 10 ppg on his career before this past year, you are literally just basing your opinion of him as a scorer on Houston. His ""normal"" is 6-8 FGA per game, so his scoring on a normal team doesnt have that high of an impact when its such low volume.  &gt;I’m not saying as a GM I would market him over 10 million, but it’s probably gonna happen.   And I'm saying it probably wont based on what his ""tier"" of player has gotten in the past, but hey I might be surprised."
"Robin Lopez is not a better scorer than Olynk right now, there’s just no argument there. None. He’s also 3 years older, which is considerable.  I’m not saying as a GM I would market him over 10 million, but it’s probably gonna happen. The reason is in general people are getting paid more over time, and also this off-season there are not many key free agents, so teams on the margin may pay a bit extra for him"
"Last offseason: Derrick Favors making 9.7m  Jakob Poeltl making 8.7m  Ibaka making 9.5m  Robin Lopez making 7.3m  The only thing Olynyk has over these guys is opportunity because *someone* had to score baskets for a tanking Houston that ended up worse than Detroit or Orlando.  The market for older role-playing only Cs with middy skillsets is a lot less robust than you think.  if you want to present me a genuine counterfactual, im not above changing my opinion."
"Robin &amp; Brook Lopez, Blake, Devonte Graham, Cam Payne. All these dudes are funny as fuck"
"$1 Million is insanely little   To put it into perspective, guys like Robin Lopez and Doug McDermott are making around $7M. I can’t see a superstar risking his health to get a million extra when it could jeopardize their championship aspirations"
Robin Lopez  Edit: Andre Drummond and Montrezl Harrell
I would take Robin Lopez at this point. With no mascots to abuse he can just abuse opposing heads of state.
"switch Lopez brother and it gets closer i think. if we talk about this year, robin is already washed. so it will be elite backcourt (steph-lamelo-jrue) but washed frontcourt, whereas giannis team is at least have all around solid role players"
You forgot Robin Lopez coming off the bench. That's a great team.
Robin passing to the 5th Lopez brother
if robin lopez cut that shaggy hair I bet you wouldnt be able to tell them apart
"A lot of people don’t know this, but before they played in the NBA, Brook and Robin Lopez had a pretty successful music career. They even had a couple singles chart on the Hot 100.  They called themselves “LMFAO”"
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
"I mean, there are plenty of energy bigs who can do the ""block shot, get rebound, set screen, get out of the way"" thing. Basically just do a B-/C+ Tyson Chandler impression. Personally I think it would have been funny to send Time Lord to Tokyo, just to see what might happen.  We ought to consider that Colangelo/Krzyzewski/Popovich/whoever else is responsible for these selections communicated some kind of strategic intention or preference when they invited Love. They aren't just picking names out of a hat, there's *some* reason for that decision, however much we all disagree with it. The only plausible basketball reasons I could come up with were shooting, and a history with USA Basketball. That's why I keyed in on Myles Turner, who might be the only player who fits the profile and is eligible to represent the United States.  It really illustrates what a crazy situation this is. More broadly, we're living through this renaissance of skilled big men, you almost can't turn on an NBA game without seeing a seven-footer doing something borderline superhuman, and *NONE* of them are American/eligible to play for Team USA. (Kevin Durant doesn't count, he's 6'13"".) Instead we've got folks in this thread making full-throated endorsements for Jarrett Allen, Mason Plumlee, Brook and Robin(?) Lopez... Jarrett Allen will never in his life be even a tiny fraction of the player that Embiid, Jokic, or Gobert are. Shit, Nic Vucevic would dominate just about every American big.  Maybe it's a good thing though. Up to this point Team USA has really only been capable of doing one of two things: steamrolling everyone, or flaming out in a colossal disappointment. This is one of several major indicators that moving forward, international basketball competition might actually be a fair fight."
"They could have done that for a fraction of the price though. Guys like Robin Lopez, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Howard would have been fine."
"Yeah I agree with everything you said. I think Team USA just takes the consensus best players available, without any consideration for fit.  I literally think having a tough, strong big man who can protect the rim (Robin/Brook Lopez, etc.) would help them more than Lavine and Beal, especially against some of these smaller international teams.  Bottom line, they loaded up on scorers and on ball players, not enough facilitators and defenders, and no overarching structure for the talent to operate in."
Kevin Love is not great. I’d rather have current Robin Lopez or Mason Plumlee over this version of Kevin Love
"He got pointers from the hook god (and all time triple double leader), Robin Lopez"
Correctamundo … he’s batgirl to Robin Lopez.
"You're talking about Robin Lopez now, right? Robin Lopez is Brook Lopez's Robin Robin Lopez?"
NBA Centers with the last name Lopez with cool nicknames:  Tier 1: Robin “Captain Hook” Lopez Tier 2: Brook “Splash Mountain” Lopez  *Tier list based on coolness of nicknames not basketball skill*
"In some alternate universe we kept Robin Lopez, brought Kostas in, and have Justin and Aaron Holiday off the bench."
Nah Robin Lopez is better
Robin Lopez plays like a slow rhino with a jump hook
Robin lopez or zubac/boban and then mkg if he still in league
Robin Lopez has an ugly ass game lol
Robin Lopez in 2035
atleast Robin Lopez is the all time leader of triple doubles
Didn't Lopez get traded to the Bulls and the coach said he was happy to be getting Brook Lopez and everyone was like....you got Robin.
Robin Lopez is gonna make the HOF for starting on a playoff team more than once. Brook Lopez is basically a lock because he went to an All-Star game *and* played in the Finals.
This seems like a post Robin Lopez would be proud of lol
"Well, Robin Lopez has never averaged more than 11 points per game, so Brook did most of the heavy lifting here with 19-20 ppg in a bunch of seasons. Brook was legitimately a fringe all-star for a good part of his career, and an actual all-star in 2013. Robin has generally been a depth piece, starting some seasons but never a focal point of the offense like Brook was for the Nets."
"Robin Lopez is going to make the HOF by himself for just being a generally cool dude, so yeah I guess a fusion of him and Brook would make it too."
Just get Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez would never miss a jump hook
Of course offensively the best comparison is peak Robin Lopez
Some of the people you mentioned aren’t even All-Stars. A superstar isn’t a just talented player. Its about level of greatness and fame. Middleton is good but he ain’t Lebron/Durant/Harden/Steph level.   You don’t pick names out of a lineup. You pick faces. People that watch under 20 NBA games a year know what Steph Curry looks like. People can watch a full season and not know remember what Holiday looks like. Or could tell the difference between Brook and Robin Lopez.
"What do Jordan Hamilton, Nick Young, Jae Crowder, Larry Sanders, Zach Randolph, Vince Carter, and Robin Lopez have in common? They’ve all been ejected for taking shots at Steven Adams.  I’m not saying he’s a bad person, but the dude starts shit."
"Lucky for him Thanasis didn’t get playing time today so he’s got time to digest that before he has to wrap his head around double Antetokounmpos.  Can only imagine if we still had Robin Lopez, his head might explode."
LMFAO was actually a side project of Brook/Robin Lopez and you can’t convince me otherwise
Bucks fans really thinking they losing because of refs and not because Robin Lopez’ dick twin is guarding CP3 and Booker
Brook lopez is a FRAUD who stole all his moves from his superior brother ROBIN
"put robin on the warriors and they’re legitimately lethal imo, very random though i just had but they need a big man and robin lopez is very solid"
I guess Robin Lopez is going to have to pull the ultimate carry job next year for the Wizards.  Mascots Beware
Thats going to present Robin Lopez quite the dilemma the next time he fights their mascot.
Wookies? Lol bro wookies are mythical creatures in Star Wars. Read a book!  Edit: well I guess Robin Lopez is a wookie kind of  Edit: sorry I misread “rookies” as wookies
"To further illustrate your point about the Triangle’s learning curve, Phil Jackson tried installing the Triangle in New York with players less suited to it. He thought the Triangle would elevate Melo into a super-duper-star, but the supporting cast was a carousel of players: Jose Calderon, Samuel Dalembert, Derrick Rose, Robin Lopez, Courtney Lee, Arron Afflalo, Brandon Jennings, the withered husk of Joakim Noah, etc."
It's just a shame Robin Lopez isn't still on the Suns
we had a physical fist fight with serge and i think robin lopez they barely got two.   we had a tackle fight with kat embiid that was 2-3.  we had another fist fight with cp3 rondo and ingram. no one got more than 5 games there.    this was always going to be one game.
[idk but these two fashion icons take the cake.](http://cdn23.us1.fansshare.com/photos/brooklopez/tumblr-ly-bhy-tn-qhmu-uo-robin-lopez-1745566146.jpg)
"If guys like Poeltl, Robin Lopez, Adams, Ayton, Zubac, Drummond, Gobert, and Nurkic has a place in this league than Shaq definitely does."
"Bruh Google Robin Lopez.  (I'm joking, but he hit like 140 hook shots last year at some ridiculous %, like 65%)"
Did you know Brook and Robin Lopez played on the same high school team as Quincy Pondexter and failed to win a state title together?
Imagine how much better the Steve Nash Suns would be with him instead of Robin Lopez or any of the Centers we had back then
"They were bad last year but I think they dealt with the most or close to the most covid disruptions than any other team in the league and it wasn't until they made their run at the end of the year where they finally had a consistent run with their main guys all there. They also lost Thomas Bryant who was their starting center a couple games into the season which force them to play a lot of Alex Len and Robin Lopez before they got Gafford.    I think they'll probably convince themselves that with more health luck, getting Bryant back and maybe making a couple depth acquisitions on the wing that they could be higher up maybe like the 5 or 6 seed which maybe isn't great but for them might be worth just running it back with Beal and Russ."
Brook lopez is secretly the bat man. Middleton is Robin and Giannis is Alfred. jrue is the bat mobile
love me a good Robin Lopez trebuchet hook
Robin Lopez scored most of his points in our playoff series from hook shots.
Brook Lopez is Batman and Bobby Portis is Robin. Giannis and Middleton are frauds. Trade em.
"Briannis, Brook and Robin Lopez sound like a really hot set of triplets. Just saying!"
BUT BUT IF KHRIS IS BATMAN AND GIANNIS IS ROBIN THEN WHO IS LOPEZ!?!?!
Brook Lopez is Batman and Middletown is robin
Brook Lopez replicating the G.O.A.T. Post Hook from his lil bro Robin.
Robin Lopez in shambles
"Brook Lopez would Destroy Robin in a 1v1, Reggie is a terrible broadcaster"
Turns out Brook Lopez was Batman and Bobby Portis was Robin this whole time.
Brook Lopez deserves Disneyland with Robin
Brook and Robin Lopez Willy and Jauncho Hernangomez Paul and Marc Gasol
Robin Lopez
"Brook ""Robin Lopez's brother"" Lopez"
"Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, Raul Lopez, Raul Neto, Raul Ibanez"
Reminds me of Ibaka's aggressive grazes (usually on Robin Lopez)
I've seen variants of Kareem Abdul-Lopez floating around because Robin doesn't know how to miss hook shots
"He saw John Wall in the air ready to block, literally threw himself at Wall's legs. Nearly flipped Wall on his head. The landing was bad, and the slow mo replay made it look really deliberate.  Those elbow-chin checks during screens he did for IT during that playoff run.  And he almost did the same thing to Robin Lopez that he did to Love by literally hooking under the armpit and pulling down. Lopez looked pissed, but didnt get hurt."
"Also gotta shoutout to the later generation of that team, which a bunch are now the vets of their teams - Goran Dragic, Robin Lopez, Jared Dudley, Grant Hill, JRich, and Alvin G"
[Robin Lopez hook shot](https://youtu.be/jiIlUWHAnOw)
Sideshow Rob is a personal favorite for robin lopez
"There are exactly two players in the league who should be spamming post ups, (three if you count Robin Lopez) and everybody knows exactly who they are.  Anybody else doing it is going to be inefficient."
"Embiid was in shape enough this year for me. He needs to stop trying to put everyone on a poster and going after every highlight dunk. The worse injury was a fluke so I can't blame him, but the meniscus tear was completely avoidable imo. He's my favorite player, and I know you can't change his playstyle but damn man, up 15+ points to a team that has no shot of winning even six games against you and you catch a pass from Ben and run full speed at Robin Lopez and take off like you're Vince Carter and try to end this man's whole career and for what? And next series he's doing the same stuff at every opportunity. Just lower the number of high speed dunks please Jo. Everything else is perfect."
I'd take an off-balance Robin Lopez hook 10 second left on OT any day.
"I was just wondering who could possibly be the last person Shaq played with that could keep the streak going after this season, strangely enough it is probably LeBron. But Avery Bradley was the youngest player he played with as far as I can see born in 1990.   The only possible people would be Rondo, Robin Lopez, Jeff Green and Dragic. Everyone else I think is out of the league. Only other person would be Wade if he unretired, but that ain't happening."
All time triple-double leader Robin Lopez
I’d rather have Robin Lopez over Kevin Love for this Olympics team tbh
I’m 6’2 and on the same boat.   I describe my game as a Rondo without handles/defense or Robin Lopez without the size
Is this Robin Lopez’ burner?
Robin Lopez is scared af to defend Trae Young
Yeah Kanter is better than Alex Len or Robin Lopez
Wizards fans are just Robin Lopez fans they'll leave when he leaves
"Stat wise? I cop that Trae shot and scored better but you can’t even compare rebounds. Russ had 11.5 to Trae’s 3.9. Russ also averaged 11.7 assists (assist to turnover +6.9) to Trae’s 9.4 (assist to turnover +5.4). If shooting is all that you measure a player by then we aren’t even having the same conversation.   Team wise? The Wizards were ravaged by Covid to where they couldn’t practice, have team meetings or team workouts. Their starting center was hurt for the year. And outside Beal and Westbrook they really don’t have much of a supporting cast. Are you really gonna compte Bertans and Hachimura to Collins and Galinari? Sure Robin Lopez hit a lot of hook shots but Clint Capela averaged 14.3 rebounds this season.   The Hawks were a better team than the Wizards."
Robin Lopez came to dominate /s
Former great Joakim Noah or Robin Lopez  Both def eat rocks and hunt mammoth in their free time 100 percent confirmed
"No.  That's the point I'm making, precisely.    Just making the NBA at like robin lopez level is a level of skill that if you bumped into it at your local Y, they would be raining 3s all day, running point, absolutely dominant at everything they supposedly suck at.  In literally stating things that multiple players have said on podcasts.  It also doesn't mean that relative to other pros they are all Jesus Shuttlesworth.  It's relative to you an me."
Oh then 100% Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez is literally a caveman
"Glanced through to make sure I wasn't repeating any names already mentioned;  Guys like Steven Adams could have entire highlight reels of them just setting screens. Same thing with Robin Lopez at his peak. I think Joakim Noah deserves a nod too for how hard he hustled on every play. That Bulls team had a few guys who deserve a mention actually, Luol Deng and Taj especially."
"robin lopez, hes like brook lopez but more of a wwe wrestler who has a great disdain for mascots"
Robin Lopez and Steven Adams - Boxing Out   Michael Cooper - on ball defense
Robin Lopez scoop-hook.
Robin Lopez: ridiculous hook shot that is money as shit. He doesn't have a good post game though and his defense is bad.
Robin Lopez gonna bring this team that 1 win
"We're not disagreeing.   That's how the wizards stole 1 game that playoffs. We were horribly outmatched with embiid, nobody on our roster had anything for him. Robin Lopez was shooting sky hooks to get around.   So we fouled Simmons and the body language was awful, slumped, walking slowly to the line after being fouled on the other side of the court."
Robin Lopez spams his unstoppable hook shot and you're fucked.
Robin Lopez uppercut (on mascots)
Robin Lopez hook shot
My strategy would be to have a team of only lumbering centres. They will lose almost every game but there’s gonna be one night where a team doesn’t have the big bodies it needs and just gets beat up enough to lose.  PG: Mason Plumlee SG: Alex Len SF: Boogie PF: Robin Lopez C: DeAndre Jordan
"Rim-runners are replaceable, but there's still only a finite amount of rim-runners who are available at any given time and sometimes you gotta pay a little bit extra for the betterment of your team.  JaVale, Robin Lopez and Gorgui Dieng got all in the 4-5M per year range. The guys who got vet mins with the exception of Dwight Howard (ring-chasing) are all players that have a ton more flaws than any of the above guys."
"I can understand the lack of wanting a long-term investment but I will argue that with your team especially that JaVale was their best option and they paid slightly more than the vet min to fill a big hole in the roster.  JaVale, Robin Lopez and Gorgui Dieng got all in the 4-5M per year range. The guys who got vet mins with the exception of Dwight Howard (ring-chasing) are all players that have a ton more flaws than any of the above guys.  Rim-runners are replaceable, but there's still only a finite amount of rim-runners who are available at any given time and sometimes you gotta pay a little bit extra for the betterment of your team."
"To lose 81 games is such an incredible feat... lookin to these players to hopefully drop that ball   PG - Patrick Beverly   SG - Tony Allen   SF - KZ Okpala (iykyk)   PF - Anthony Bennett    C - Robin Lopez  Only time I can see them win is when they clamp down the worst team in the league, cuz honestly, this team's defense is pretty cool."
Robin Lopez tweet but unironically
"5v5 style tourney   Team A: Rubio, Neto, McConnell, Caruso, and Kendrick Nunn  Team B: McGee, Ayton, Howard, D Jordan, and Robin Lopez  Who wins?"
Isn’t he the guy that flexed on Robin Lopez and ran away when he retaliated
"He looked like a end of rotation player for about 15 games in 2019, and 2 pre season games last year.   He’s looked like a guy that’ll be out of the league every other game.   Obviously the Wolves have a pretty terrible record of developing young wings, but my god he looked terrible. There were concerns about him not fitting in, personality wise, with the team being floated for a while.   I’ll never forget seeing Robin Lopez, and all of Fiserv Forum wanting to fight him after he dunked on Robin though."
Robin lopez
Robin Lopez is a poor mans Brook Lopez
Actual footage of Robin Lopez:  https://youtu.be/aRq1Ksh-32g
Robin Lopez seems like a good ball handler from what we seen lately
Trade Robin Lopez to the Nets please
Robin Lopez is an amazing guy lol.
"Lebron james, he is the next Robin Lopez"
"I love it when the big man is a hype dude. TOTALLY forgot about Robin Lopez tho, wasn’t an end of the bench dude but I loved his mascot drama!"
Robin Lopez certainly does
The existential musings of Robin Lopez could be a great book
I randomly saw Robin Lopez while touring around Toronto in 2019. He was probably in town watching his brother play because it was Bucks vs Raptors playoffs at the time.   He is genuinely huge. I didn't really talk to him because he was with his lady but I was standing right next to him. I basically came up to his waist and I'm 5'8.
"I once saw Robin walking to a minor league baseball. He was with another tall guy and an average height guy. I thought to myself that mofo is tall! Wait, that's fucking Robin Lopez! It didn't hit me until a hour or two later. Wait that other tall was Brook!"
*Robin Lopez goes out trick and treating but then realized that it’s not Halloween*
Rookie Robin Lopez. Who knew that we would someday be congratulating him on an NBA championship?
Robin Lopez just nodding and agreeing ..
"Robin Lopez, the Big Socrates. Better than the Big Aristotle"
I once bumped into Robin Lopez at DFW airport. I’m 6’3” and my head bumps into a dude’s chest and I’m like who the hell is this. Then I look up and I’m staring into Robin Lopez’s crazy eyes. He quietly said “oh sorry man” and kept walking.
bucks were a super team? lol...  also robin lopez wasn't on mke.
robin lopez was on the wizards lol. he didn't win
Robin Lopez a deep thinker presented a personal perspective about the chip.
Robin Lopez has looked the exact same for 13 years lol
"""This league is full of theatrics and thespians. Several of you are worthy of Oscar-level performances for what you've done tonight. You should all be embarrassed — all of you, embarrassed.""     \- Robin Lopez to Tyler Herro, 2021"
"Imagine Robin Lopez playing rock paper scissors with himself in the mirror, only to lose to his reflection and realize it’s his brother"
robin lopez is handsome as fuck compared to noah   sorry for the stray
Brook and Robin Lopez are two of the most interesting people in the NBA lol
"It seems like at least half of the people in this thread haven't realized that Robin Lopez wasn't on the Bucks this year, and did *not* win a championship..."
Robin Lopez all time nba leader with 183 triple doubles? He's a winner already. :P
"""Robin Lopez retires from professional basketball"""
"""Oh my god, I'm going to die one day""  \-Robin Lopez, minutes after winning his first championship, 2023"
"Imagining Robin Lopez deep in thought, peering forlornly at his reflection in the mirror, but it's actually a photo of his brother"
Bucks Twitter tells people all the time that Robin Lopez taught Kareem how to shoot a hook shot.
Every year I fall more and more in love with Robin Lopez  Despite Portland 😠
i was so surprised when i clicked on that robin lopez twitter link and all the replies seemed like actual people interacting with the actual tweet instead of spammed bs....
lmaooo k i need to follow robin lopez
Robin Lopez matters.
"Robin Lopez has been on a tear posting bangers on twitter lately. If you don't follow him already, you should."
Robin Lopez is probably my favorite personality in this leauge
I wanna see Robin Lopez as an NBA media personality when actually does retire/gets pranked out of the league.
Can we all join together to play a big prank on Robin Lopez?
Robin Lopez would be such a silly person to try to get rid of too lmao like of all people to ice out of the league they’d choose him
Is Robin Lopez okay?
I will add Robin Lopez used to date Michelle Wie back in college.
Brook Lopez is Batman and Robin is Robin
Not even in Nets history. Brook Lopez and even Robin Lopez are both huge dorks lmao
Was really hoping Brooklyn Nets fan was actually Robin Lopez
Robin “Skyhook Jr” Lopez
Robin Lopez
And the analytics-fucking Robin Lopez scoop shot.
Did you two speak the night the Bucks won the championship?  About Paddington?  Robin Lopez is the greatest.
"It's more that people just star gaze when they remember the knicks teams and ignore what Phil Jackson was doing to that team.  Like Phil's first year, the knicks starting line up was: Shane Larkin - Iman Shumpert - Carmelo Anthony - Amar'e Stoudemire - Samuel Dalembert  The next season: Jose Calderon - Sasha Vujacic - Carmelo Anthony - Kristaps Porzingis - Robin Lopez  Like when these bad rosters lost games, starting games with guys that would be out of the league in a year, it's easy to blame the guy you remember, because no one remembers Cole Aldrich, Quincy Acy, or Lou Amundson starting and getting significant minutes on a team fans expected to make the playoffs."
"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks. Retained all key players and bench pieces, while getting to while touted rookies that dropped a lot and have huge potential)  Worst offseason: New Orleans Peicans (that's fair)  Best value contract: Lonzo Ball, Chicago Bulls  (that's fair or even a slight overpay, I'd say DRose is a better player for less money)  Best value contract (buyout division): Kemba Walker, New York Knicks (seems alright)  Best value contract (minimum division): Otto Porter, Golden State Warriors (also a decent pick)  Worst value contract: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls (Khem Birch 3/20 is way worse imo, that dude is a third stringer at best)  Best fit: Reggie Bullock, Dallas Mavericks (decent pick)  Worst fit: Robin Lopez, Orlando Magic (okayish pick, Drummond is probably worse though)  Best gettable free agent remaining: Dennis Schroder (definitely right.)"
"It's a perfect fit honestly. We are stretched for minutes as it is, and our team is so young that we needed a vet who wasn't going to play much and still be a great mentor/locker room presence. No one on our team needs mentoring more than Mo and Wendell, and both could greatly benefit from some toughness. They don't make them tougher than Robin Lopez."
"The Magic had two roster spots, and if they intended to bring back Wagner then it was only really one roster spot. It seems exceedingly petty to harp on the team for how they choose to fill the last roster spot when the franchise's only goal for the next season is to develop young guys. And honestly, Robin Lopez is good enough to get a roster spot on a contender if he really wanted to, so the Magic were going to have to pay to get a player of his caliber to work Mo's ass in practice and see if they can salvage a former #6 pick before he hits restricted free agency.  He's also not even getting the full MLE (only $5 million) and is easily traded before the deadline for the Magic to get some kind of asset back if they choose to do so."
Whoa robin Lopez went to magic
"The Magic have 3 other centers on the roster; all are 24 or younger and 2 are on rookie contracts. As a rebuilding team, i simply can’t make sense of having Robin Lopez there.  (Carter Jr, Wagner, Bamba are the 3)"
"Orlando already had three young centers on the roster in Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba and Moe Wagner, so what was the point in using the MLE on Robin Lopez as well?"
Surely there has to be a worse fit than Robin Lopez on the Magic lmao
"Below average defense, for sure. And 5.3 rebounds for a 7 footer is well below average. His rebounding rate dropped once robin lopez left and no one was there to box out for him and get him free boards.  Although, i agree that he would've improved on offense with lonzo."
I mean you’re looking at a Dinwiddie/Beal/Kuzma/Rui/Harrell lineup?   Or start KCP and Robin Lopez and have Kuzma and Harrell anchor the bench squad?   15 ppg either way probably. A couple good passes. A couple bad passes
Robin Lopez
Benny the Bull vs Robin Lopez Hell in a Cell
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
"Yeah because of Dolson, my first thought was finding a big body with a good post game (actually Robin Lopez could be sneaky good in this format with his little hook shot), but I do think it would be very different for men.  There's too many big guys with perimeter skills that would cook a big guy defending them and could still hold their own defending the post"
"robin lopez absolutely carried him in the rebounding department, he’d box out and let him eat"
Robin Lopez and bulls mascot
I think Robin lopez would be a good fit but he signed with Magic.
"I don't trust Wiseman at this point and Looney can't play heavy minutes. There's a reason we were so much better with Wiseman off the floor. I guess Bjelica might steal a few minutes but that's a defensive nightmare. Draymond will always be our best center but like you said, that's only when it really matters. I just want a veteran center like Robin Lopez or Marquese Chriss who can grab a few boards and maybe block a shot here and there."
That number is deceptive. It’s high because Robin Lopez  boxed out for Lauri and let him get the board. Lauri flourished next to him.
"You know it’s the Magic. They got all those benches beat.  Cole Anthony/MCW, Suggs/RJ Hampton, T Ross/Bacon, Franz &amp; Mo Wagner and Mo Bamba/Robin Lopez  Assuming returning starters are healthy and starters are Fultz, Gary Harris, Chuma, Isaac and Wendell Carter."
But captain Robin hook lopez just went to the magic/s
"I looked him up.  Undrafted in 2016. Played some summer leagues, got waived from the Charlotte Hornets in Preseason.  I guess he would still count as a rookie, if he comes in.  I think he is much better now than some negative comments on the bottom. He is the best rebounder at the olympics. His offense is solid.  I rate him definitly higher than javale mcgee or willie cauley stein.  Can probably have similar impact like Plumlee, Theis or Robin Lopez."
Most teams didn’t play the Wizards for 5 games! Our best scorers at times were Robin Lopez and Ish Smith off the bench
"Okay so if you're going to move the goalposts from ""create for themselves"" to ""has offensive value"", then I could tell you about how Rui Hachimura and Robin Lopez are serviceable offensive players that are effective scorers on the inside, and how much shooting the Rockets had with guys like Tucker, Gordon and Green spotting up."
"I know the US big man pool is really weak but God damn we can do better than bam. Get robin lopez, he'd be way better in this environment"
"Which is fair, I was annoyed Robin Lopez went to Orlando for the vet minimum but he most likely wanted a bigger role than 14 minutes a night. If he doesn’t work out then they have Paschal, or Gay who could play small ball center in a pinch and last years 1st round pick Dok. He was just hurt all last year and is still extremely raw so Utah didn’t want to make him the primary backup yet"
"We'll see, and I'm open to being wrong. But Kings fans thought the exact same thing last offseason - just need a big body on a one-year deal to eat some minutes against opposing bigs. Whiteside was miles worse than that. He was a fucking saboteur who actually made the team worse every time he stepped on the court. The only reason he got any minutes at all was because the Kings didn't have another 7 footer on the roster until the trade deadline, when Whiteside was immediately benched for fucking Damian Jones.  I really think Jazz would have been better off with any other cheap vet at that position: Alex Len, Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, whoever. But I guess it might not matter, because there's zero chance he plays a single second in the playoffs."
"Yep someone awhile back said if Russ even during prime years had 30-40 FGA the Thunder lost that game and it’s because he absolutely does this.    Put differently would you prefer a Westbrook 15 footer in light coverage, A Robin Lopez hook shot for 7 feet or an Ish Smith drive into coverage?  I don’t love that Westbrook jumper but it’s the best out of a list of bad options.    Doesn’t mean all of the bad shots are situations like that because they aren’t he does take some bad shots it’s just exaggerated because he takes an awful lot of best of bad options shots.  Only place that really wasn’t true so far is Houston where he shot highest percentage in a long time and cut down on his threes a ton.  Not only that damn near all of his attempts were wide open.  He shot a god forsaken percentage on them but they weren’t bad shots."
"Carter, Bamba, Robin Lopez, and now Mo Wagner lol"
Dam I just made my own Mathematical formula too!!! Here's my results:  2021- Jared Dudley  2020- Jared Dudley  2019- Jared Dudley  2018- Jared Dudley  2017- Jared Dudley  2016- Jared Dudley  2015- Jared Dudley  2014- Robin Lopez  I found some of these results shocking and wouldn't have picked them myself before running the formula. What do you think?
Robin Lopez weird side hook
Robin Lopez
"I met Barkley at a car wash back in the 90s and he signed a bag of skittles for me.  Suns used to do training camp in Tucson when I was in college. A few years in a row I some guys out at the bar. Nash, Raja, Robin Lopez, Lou Amundsuon lol. Drunkenly talked to Lopez for like 5 minutes. He was just drafted, and he was very polite while my drunk ass blathered on to him.  Matt Barnes smashed some sorority girl I knew through a friend.   I told this one the other day, but I worked at Subway and made Alvin Gentry a sweet onion chicken teriyaki"
Robin Lopez should def be up there
Russell Westbrook getting the rebound and initiating the fast break is far more valuable than Steven Adams/ Clint Capela/ Robin Lopez.
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
"I saw Robin Lopez at EPCOT last week. He was just walking by eating some ice cream. I told him ""good luck with the Magic this season"" and he just said ""thanks"". I had heard he was a big Disney fan, so it kinda made sense but was still pretty surprising. I wonder if now that he lives here I'll see him in the parks again sometime."
Glad the Kings were able to keep him. Could watch this and Robin Lopez hooks for hours.
1. Kawhi (if available) 2.Giannis  3. AD  4. Simmons (if traded) 5. Klay (see 1) 6. Jrue  7. Gobert  8. Butler  9. Draymond 10. KD (when he wants to) 11. Robin Lopez (if no switch) 12. Bam 13. Patrick Beverly 14. Embiid  15. Marcus Smart  16. Bledsoe 17. CP3  18. Alex Carusso  19. Mikal Bridges 20. Lebron (as defensive QB)
"Monte Morris, Josh Hart, Otto Porter Jr, Larry Nance, Robin Lopez"
Billy Donovan is defensive minded coach it will be main task for him this season but Bulls is in the top 20 defense for years even with worse defensive rosters.  Bulls really had trouble last year with defending rival ballhandlers in both half court. Transition defense was terrible because of Coby just can't defend anyone. Now we have Ball and Caruso in the roster both of them can defend main ballhandler in perimeter. Lavine's defensive improvements were one of the least talked storylines of the last season as well. And also Bulls are loaded with one-way defensive wings in the bench unit. Perimeter defense won't be problem as long as Derozan don't defend the main perimeter threat.   Bulls defense having troubles in the post since they lost Robin Lopez as well. Giving rival teams most offensive rebounds in the league didn't helped them as well. But Vucevic is one of the better rebounders in the league without Markkanen and Carter Jr's rebounding problems and having Ball and Derozan gonna help them as well about rebounding. Bulls won't be great defensive team or anything but until playoffs I don't think they will be bottom 10 teams. If Donovan cover Vucevic's post defense with drop defense and use Patrick Williams and Zach Lavine as help defender atleast they can limit the pain.
Robin Lopez isn’t a scrub
"You're right actually - I saw the clip [here](https://youtu.be/BX-iQ-dQWpw?t=118) and thought it looked like an and-1, but Robin Lopez never shot a FT against the Lakers that season so it would've been called a held ball."
Robin Lopez is our most accomplished player. Need I go on?
Robin Lopez?
Brook and Robin Lopez are the biggest bros
He would be someone even better. He would be Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez would be Kareem if he played 50 years ago.
Other than Brook and Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
"This post was built for me.   1. Robin Lopez has the looks to replace BJ but he’s way better than him.  2. Edwards as Tyrus Thomas size wise makes sense, but give me MKG for game fit.  3. Tobias Harris is my Boris replacement 4. Why not go Bismack to Bismack. I’d also be interested in Gafford as a replacement 5. I love Ish for DJ  Bench:  1. Cole Anthony (Kemba) 2. I wouldn’t trade anyone else they were all perfect because they were the Bobcats. May they Rest In Peace"
"Robin Lopez, PLEASE. Idk what hes good at lol other then hook shots I heard those are bussin"
"Russ had nothing to do with Robin Lopez, Lopez was used almost exclusively as a source of post up offence when Russ was sitting so they had that go-to scoring punch. The other examples are fair though. It’s a bit different though when you also have Lebron, who does the majority of his damage in the paint even if his 3s have been creeping upwards. This isn’t a simple Russ/ big pick and roll duo surrounded by shooting specialists, it’s 3 star level slashers with inconsistent jumpers who’s bread and butter when it comes to scoring is inside the arc"
"Russ played with Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford last year. All three of those guys benefited from Russ's play. The idea that he Russ doesn't gel with big men is very wrong. His interior passing and rim running passes are how he gets a ton of assists."
I think Orlando Magic would do it.   Who’s there best player? Wendell carter? Terrance Ross? Robin lopez? Cole Anthony? They aren’t winning a championship with that squad and lebron would be solid for them.
Robin Lopez
League warned Bulls not to rest fucking Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday lmao.
"The ""Curry can't carry a weak roster"" talking point should have been dead after 2012-2013, but it should have been taken out of the grave and killed again after he went 37-26 with last year's team.  Can LeBron ""carry a team"" if those 2018-2019 Lakers missed the playoffs? The Lakers had a record of 28-27 with LeBron healthy. I don't fault LeBron for that though because it's really tough to win with young players. You could make an argument that getting to .500 with that many young guys was just as impressive as some of these other ""carry jobs"" people laud. And similarly, Curry's record definitely would have been better than 37-26 if you replaced Wiseman with a vet center like Robin Lopez or something.  Fortunately for LeBron, the Lakers shipped out the young guys and got some vets and he won a title next season. Whereas Lacob tripled down on the youth movement this summer, so it probably won't go as smoothly for Curry. But definitely don't confuse that with an ""inability to carry a team"". Curry was carrying G-League (actually D-League at the time) players to wins in the second half of his rookie season."
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, supported by Evan Turner, Steven Adams, and Robin Lopez"
"Pat Bev for intensity, Jimmy Buckets for playfulness, Blake Griffin because he does standup, Robin Lopez because Robin Lopez, Boban because of John Wick 3"
Doesn’t Robin Lopez hit 3’s in games though?
"I will always upvote a post about my birthday twins, Brook and/or Robin Lopez"
"Ben been putting a show from 3 pre game for years now.  I've watched him probably 20 different times just knock own 5-6 in a row.      i watched Robin Lopez do it too, but point is that Ben has always been more than capable of attempting those shots in a game.   Teams would let him walk into a 3 or camp in the corner as an outlet."
"that suns team was loaded even if a few of the guys were past their primes: steve nash, jason richardson, amar'e stoudemire, shaq, grant hill, throw in boris diaw, goran dragic, robin lopez, matt barnes, raja bell, and jared dudley. not to mention stromile swift!"
Ibaka and Robin Lopez imo. Especially RoLo that fucker just has lunatic in his eyes. Which is kinda weird because he has a ton who gives off soft teddy bear vibes
Remember when Kendrick said “Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer” and people thought he said Ibaka since it was like 2 days after he punched Robin Lopez?  https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/61704a/pretty_sure_kendrick_lamar_just_referenced_ibaka/
I think just the presence of Robin Lopez will make them better than a 9 win team. The hook shot goat will not let them be that bad.
Robin Lopez is a mostly white Cuban with Sideshow Bob hair
New thread incoming: Would Robin Lopez dominate in another era?
Players like Robin Lopez and Al horford managed to learn to shoot 3s at a good percentage even though they had minimal shooting skills coming into the nba. You really think the greatest midrange shooter of all time couldn't find a way to extend his range if he needed to? Even lebron figured it out and he's not half the shooter Jordan was.

Robin Lopez hook shot
Robin Lopez and his spectacular hook shot
"Embiid or Robin Lopez as Shaq.   Someone thoughtful but goofy in the Kenny role, maybe Jeremy Lin or Kemba or someone like that."
1 Kareem  2)Robin Lopez hook shot
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that’s why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can’t have two non-shooting players on the floor in today’s nba. Ben also prob isn’t gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You’re not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
"Yeah, I think I'm done bitching unless they're stacking active superstars of which there are 10-14 in the league. These guys have names so they get looked at as a super team when Robin Lopez realistically been a bigger pick up in terms of +/-.   This guy worked his ass of his whole career, didn't get a ship and feels he can contribute somewhat to a winning team."
robin lopez had the highest ppp last season for guys with &gt;1 post up per game and 50 games played. embiids volume is crazy tho. kawhi was also good on ppp and volume.
"By faaar too. He shot 9.3 attempts per game out of the post, nobody else was above 6.  In terms of efficiency he’s only below some guards/wings who posted up far less, and shot slightly better (KD, Kawhi and DeRozan among others) or very low usage guys like Robin Lopez"
Robin Lopez hook
"can't bring himself to shoot in game?  I saw Robin Lopez chucking 3s on the Bulls  he plays basketball - he can shoot. He's just too arrogant and coddled to be able to handle looking bad when he misses.  He needs ""the inner game of tennis"" badly but it would be lost on him."
Is Robin Lopez going to try to kill him?
This should have been the plot of Space Jam 2 imo. Robin Lopez rises to become a supervillain and tries to destroy the Looney Toons because of his hatred.
Westbrook made Robin Lopez look like a high level post player. AD will feast

Robin Lopez killed our mascot
"And according to that video, he died in the middle of May 2018. Robin Lopez was with the Bulls that season but they finished last in their division and missed the playoffs, so their season was done in April. *Dead. Last.* WHERE'S YOUR ALIBI ROBIN"
"According to Wikipedia Robin Lopez was born on 4/1/88, which means that Lopez was 8-14 years old during Fuller's tenure as mascot. Robin said that he was in 3rd or 4th grade when this happened, which means that he was 9-11 years old at the time.  The dickhead in question is Sadiki Fuller. Case closed."
robin lopez honestly is so fun to watch and seems chill off court. he also has the most unstoppable shot since kareems sky hook

Culver told him what happens when you dunk on Robin Soft Lopez.
100% Robin Lopez and Serge Ibaka
"If I had to put my money on it, it’d be Robin Lopez"
Robin Lopez was having flashbacks to Jarret Culver
Honestly after seeing Steven Adam’s make Mobely look like a middle schooler yesterday in 1 on 1’s I wouldn’t be surprised if Robin Lopez could absolutely torch Bamba in practice lol
Robin Lopez about to share his comic book collection with Mo Bamba and that absolutely rules.
Robin Lopez in shambles
I would be fine with that honestly. Robin Lopez has had a decent career. He isn't going to live up to the hype.
"So, the Magic signed Robin Lopez to make Mo Bamba as good as Robin Lopez."
That hook shot is gonna earn Robin Lopez a lot of money.
"GarPax Bulls EASILY from 2016 til they got canned last year…trading D Rose for Robin Lopez was heartbreaking man and then they brought in wade and rondo immediately after saying they wanted to get ‘younger’, the Felicio contract, Denzel Valentine….dark dark times"
"I met robin lopez in line for slash mountain. Real nice guy. maybe a year or 2 after he left Stanford. as a ucla fan, them dudes gave us trouble"
"He starts making those, Robin Lopez may not be the best player in the league any longer"
"Robin Lopez, the Wilt Chamberlain of our generation"
Ah yeah Robin Lopez and his hook shots lol
"Nice try, Robin Lopez."
"You can’t just look at stats. I have watched every single game that Lauri has played since he made the NBA. You’ll clearly notice that his highest rebounding numbers were his first 2 years. That’s when he was playing with Robin Lopez for almost all his burn and RoLo is one of the league’s best at boxing out, creating all these free rebounds for Lauri. That’s how Robin Lopez led the league in defensive box outs per 48 min last year, despite never having super gaudy rebounding numbers. He’s always been one of those super unselfish players who’ll do the dirty work and let the other players get the boards. Like in 17-18, despite Lauri averaging 7.5 rebounds per game and Lopez only 4.5, Lopez had drastically more offensive rebounds and box outs. He was playing hard inside and getting the tough boards and letting Lauri pick up the easy ones  I mean, you’ll notice the sharp drop off in Lauri’s rebounding numbers once Lopez left. Last year, he only averaged 5 rpg and for the last 2 years, he has had the lowest rebounding rate for a 7 footer who plays at least 20 mpg."
"I think it’s because the guy has so much potential but he is absolutely frustrating to watch sometimes. Set aside him NEVER being healthy for a full season, he just doesn’t seem to do the things that made him successful before. He can’t rebound or play defense. His best season was alongside robin lopez who basically boxed out the entire team so Lauri could get the board. He also flat out stopped putting the ball on the floor and driving in which he found a lot of success early on with. He’s become a spot up 3 point shooter and a massive liability on the defensive end. I also personally think he doesn’t want to give that extra effort. I don’t think you will see him dive for a loose ball ever. There’s so much more I can say about him but hopefully that gives you some insight."
Lauri’s best years were at the 4 playing alongside Robin Lopez. He needs a big defensive center to take the pressure off him and do the dirty work. I don’t see him succeeding at the 3. He needed a change of scenery and I wish him the best but he has only himself to blame for his shortcomings at this point.
"i could see it, I was thinkin Robin Lopez would be pretty traumatic too"
Robin Lopez
robin lopez + another egg also being fertilized = brook lopez
robin lopez + mason plumlee = brook lopez
Sideshow Bob (Robin Lopez)
Robin Lopez is not mvp caliber
"Old Shaq is kinda the cheat code to this: the '09 Suns could run Nash-Dragic-Grant Hill-Amare-Shaq, with Matt Barnes/Barbosa/Jason Richardson/Robin Lopez off the bench (with MVP of my heart Stromile Swift dunking on everyone in garbage time).   Honorable mention: obviously the '11 Mavs won the title, but prime Kidd-Peja-Marion-Dirk-Chandler with Terry/Caron Butler off the bench would be fun.  Other honorable mention: '14 Brooklyn Nets: Deron-Joe Johnson-Pierce-KG-Brook Lopez, with Kirilenko and Mason Plumlee off the bench (and Jason Kidd because I want to include coaches in this hypothetical)"
"it feels like it doesn't even make sense. lot of interesting placements of names on here. idk why I'm surprised Robin Lopez is at 20 over so many other guys.  ""NBA &amp; ABA Active Leaders and Records for Games https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/g_active.html"
I don’t get robin lopez for the Pelicans. Is it bc they’re both birds?
Robin Lopez is our only hope
The lack of love for Robin Lopez drinking his tea is disgraceful
Man I remember this watching the clip but before I did I completely forgot this ever happened. NBA really did their best to try to make sure people didn't remember this ever happened lmao. Like Klay dunking on KD when KD was still with OKC. Didn't even make Klay's top 10 plays when he made the All-Star team for the first time. They legit had like 4 or 5 just regular three pointers from his 37 point game. Also didn't put his poster on Robin Lopez in the top 10 either smh.
"Steph, Giannis, Jimmy, Mikal Bridges, robin lopez"
Luka Magic  Ice Trae  Captain Hook (Robin Lopez aka Rolo)  Spider Mitchell  Ja is just “Ja” like Cher  White Donte (Divencenzo)  King Julius   Logo Lillard  Go Go Gafford   Latvian Laser Dāvis Bertāns  Black Samurai Rui Hachimura
Robin Lopez always pulls his socks on crooked.  drives me nuts.
Add in Robin Lopez hook shots and you have a perfect lineup of shots
"Robin Lopez is slow as hell, this is where having Chuma, JI, Gary and MCW would help big time  &amp;#x200B;  come to think of it, that's a lot of missing depth lol"
robin lopez??
Man the old saying 'don't have bad players in rotation' is really true. With a total garbage time player front court outside of Giannis its hard to win. Wish we still had Robin Lopez.
I like his development path now that Clifford is out of the picture. If he was still in Orlando Robin Lopez would be starting and getting 30 minutes per game next to Etwaun Moore and MCW.
Suggs shot awful but he's way better than Cole Anthony.  We need to stop playing them together.  It honestly looks like Anthony feels threatened by Suggs whenever they are on together.  Also stop playing Wendell Carter at the 4.  And stop playing Robin Lopez.  Just split the minutes with Wendell and Mo.
It doesn't help that their probably 2 best players in Robin Lopez and Terrence Ross are coming off the bench
Robin Lopez is only here so he can pay for his Club 33 dues.
Robin Lopez last year too lol.   2.0 Off to 1.8 Def
Robin Lopez often comes close
"Might end up being a win-win trade.   But getting multiple good players for a team with no depth is a win. Especially considering Dinwiddie fills most of the void left by Westbrook.    Essentially went from .. Westbrook, Garrison Matthews, Chandler Hutchison, Robin Lopez =&gt; Spencer Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell"
The NBA all time triple-double leader Robin Lopez
And Robin Lopez became the deadliest deep 2 shooter in the leauge 💀
"Pretty bad is underselling it lol, they were stunningly terrible. They shot 34% from three on bottom 3 volume. Their guard rotation was Rondo/Wade/Jerian Grant/MCW, so they had to have Robin Lopez shoot long 2s to try and get some spacing  Massive credit to Jimmy for taking them to the postseason"
"I'm fairly certain the idea is that a 36 year old lebron cannot be your primary ballhandler and playmaker for what you hope to be 100+ games this year, regular season and playoffs.   Yeah, he is bionic or whatever, but even cybernetics have limitations.   So you bring in Russ, who just spend a year making Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford look like an above average center rotation, and have him be your playmaker for the regular season. Or at least large stretches of it. LeBron still going to take over late in any close games.   LeBron can rest a bit playing off ball more, AD should feast on the PnR with him, they have some decent shooting to spread around him.   They'll cruise to the playoffs, and then LeBron takes over once he is back in his natural habitat. And hopefully by then they'd have figured out how to make russ fit into the lebron offense.     What is concerning is that I didnt see like any of that yesterday, it was the LeBron/AD show all game long.  And if that's the plan this season, lebron still as like the primary ballhandler and playmaker when he is on the floor... I dont know how they are going to make it work."
I'm actually a Robin Lopez man myself
I want Robin Lopez to win a ring before he retires
Robin Lopez was probably at home watching the first Paddington while Brook got his ring lmao.
"That's ""NBA all-time triple doubles leader Robin Lopez"" to you"
"With vets like Terrence Ross, Robin Lopez, Gary Harris, Etwuan Moore and MCW it will be fun to watch their growth. Magic need to focus on adding shooting and wing help which is why if Adrian Griffin Jr is healthy he would be perfect for us at the 3 spot. Magic will have $28 million in capspace next yr and it will be fun to watch the growth of all these guys and see what we get for our vets during the trade deadline."
Robin Lopez?
A small forward  A good GM  Robin Lopez
Brook Lopez on Robin Lopez: “We are twins. We’re just different colors.”
"Dame's team with a prime LMA, robin lopez, wes Matthews, and nic batum was nothing to scoff at. Lma put up several 40+ point games against houston"
"brook lopez on robin lopez: ""we are twins, we're just different colors."""
Robin and Brook Lopez: Eat Pez candy off the floor
Robin Lopez also seems like the type of dude to shoot himself out of a cannon at halftime.
"I know it was hard to watch lol. Russ needs shooters to be a great player and we gave him Robin Lopez, Alex Len, and Ish Smith, often on the floor the same time"
The following players had a higher 3% than AD last season.   Draymond Green  Robin Lopez  Ben Simmons
Robin Lopez still holds that honor
"I can’t say about the actual stats, but he was running with Robin Lopez and Alex Len as his big men, with two of Neto, ish Smith, and Beal. It’s expected that they wouldn’t push the pace that well. Irregardless his rebounds easily helped the team get easy baskets. You could always count on Rui getting an easy 2 points every game just off of leaking out and catching a near full court pass from Westbrook."
Robin Lopez for Benny the bull.
this totally seems like a Robin Lopez bit
"At first I wanted to be mad but actually the backup C pool is pretty barren. I think Robin Lopez has a case, and whichever of Blake/Aldridge the Nets are going to have on the bench."
He believed the moon landing was fake in exactly the way Robin Lopez doesn't believe the Bucks won the championship. As a joke.
Me neither but in 2011 I was walking through Pisa and Robin Lopez walks passed me. He is a massive person.
Yeah unfortunately Lillard hit one of the most amazing clutch 3’s I’ve ever seen in the playoffs and we had to re-tool the team. I wish Harden and Dwight had a better pick and roll connection but Dwight was still in his phase of thinking he needed to post up all the time. To be fair to him he was absolutely COOKING Robin Lopez all series too. BBQ Chicken Erneh
Well then Robin Lopez is top 3 and I can’t disagree with that
Check out Robin Lopez at the end 😂
Robin Lopez is low key very witty
Robin Lopez gotta be on the other end. Dude always looking like he’s trying to remember something
"All my theory’s are stupid as fuck but they make watching games I don’t care about more fun. Especially watching with friends. So here they are. -Robin Lopez never played for the bucks, it was Brook in a wig the whole time.   -Payton Pritchard actually wanted to be the leprechaun mascot for the Celtics but signed the wrong contract, and he’s Irish and is fueled by beer and potatoes. (I know these are dumb stereotypes but that’s what makes it funny)  -Aaron Nesmith is James Nesmiths son, frozen in time and given the instructions to the commissioner on when to be awakened. This means he’s Adams son as well  -lastly ( that I can think of right now) Brad Stevens is a mutant clone of Frank Vogel that was supposed to sabotage the Celtics but went rouge.  Btw I’m not really a Celtics fan I have no clue why I have so many theories about them. Anyways that’s my Ted talk, thanks for listening."
"Gafford is more of a PF playing up size. Their franchise cornerstone centre, Thomas Bryant, tore his ACL at the start of last season.  They were playing Alex Len and Robin Lopez as their centres... I mean I had no doubt Russ was gonna take them to the playoffs. But... holy sht I had my doubts for a while xD"
Is your current top five just Robin Lopez x5?
robin lopez seems cool on twitter
Robin Lopez &gt; Brook Lopez
"A few months ago, I learn that Robin Lopez is a big fan of theme parks (one of my hobbies), and now I learn he's great at pinball (my other hobby)?! I guess we're friends now."

Knicks legend Robin Lopez.  Love that dude.
"Robin Lopez to the Heat following a Herro flop, start of the 2020-21 season"
I remember getting off a plane once and walking by Robin Lopez with his cat looking pretty calm in its carrier.
I feel like Robin Lopez could have a fruitful career as a full time memer after he retires
I love Robin Lopez
"What team is dumb enough to trade for Kyrie? The Kings? Kyrie for Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson? Kyrie to the Magic for Gary Harris, Mo Bamba, and Robin Lopez? Lol"
Robin Lopez did that one year in Chicago. I believed the only game he missed that year was due to a fight with Serge Ibaka.
"&gt;You need to work on your reading comprehension. I'm saying the opposite. His value was in that potential, but he hasn't improved so that bubble has popped and teams are reassessing his value.....sixers need to do the same.  Lmao I understood what you said fine, it's just hilarious to me that you seriously think teams won't take a chance on his untapped potential because he hasn't hit a peak only 4 years into the league. His value is still based on his potential no matter how you try and spin it, Simmons just turned 25 and despite him not having a breakout year yet he will always be a 6'10 guard that can play 1-5 in the modern nba. If Simmons even becomes a below average shooter he is infinitely more valuable than Dame or Beal has ever been because as good as they can score their style of play isn't conducive to  winning a chip nor can they even come close to what he does on the other end.   Simmons value is dropping because he is proving to be a mental midget by refusing to even attempt to shoot in live games despite us seeing videos of him working on his shooting form every year in the offseason. Saying he isn't a shooter doesn't justify a lack of effort when I can watch guys like blake griffin and  robin lopez reinvent themselves as shooters way later in their careers."
"We dont actually hate him, his lack of development while frustrating was partially the FO's fault. He never had a legit PG to get him the ball in good spots. His offensive game regressed from his rookie year (mid range, face up, a little bit of post game all disappeared) and he just ended up at the 3pt line never taking advantage of mismatches. Was never a good passer and without a hefty big a la Robin lopez to clear space he wasn't a good rebounder. Not to mention no shot blocking ability and lack of defensive awareness. I wish him the best, things just didn't work out for him here."
Robin Lopez did this
Robin Lopez to keep things light
Last year’s Robin Lopez had an all-nba level hook shot and was nothing special at anything else
"Robin Lopez, hook shot"
"Tier 1: Gobert, Embiid   Tier 2 : Bropez, AD, Giannis  Tier 3 : Turner, Noel, Poeltl, Robin Lopez, Capela  &amp;#x200B;  Turner, Noel &amp; Poeltl are better pure shot blockers then the guys in tier 2 (and frankly maybe even then the tier 1), but as pure rim protectors when in positions drivers are a bit less ""scared"" IMO, less deterence"
Pretty sure Brook and Robin Lopez are in a similar situation.
"Bro, Drummond's ""rivals"" now are the likes of Hassan Whiteside, Robin Lopez and Derrick Favors."
Isaac mvp through gods will   Robin lopez dpoy through nat geos education
"Biyombo legit has stone hands, I swear Robin Lopez can handle and catch the ball better than Biyombo"
"Honestly, as much as there is a pressure on unvaccinated players to get vaccinated, there also seems to be this pressure amongst the league to understand where antivaxxers are coming from.  The amount of people we saw say ""i just need to protect my family"" vs the amount that said ""the scientists that are smarter than me said it will help and i trust them"" is huge. The only person I can think of that came out against antivax is Robin Lopez with his comment on his brothers ring, and that probably went over every NBA players head."
"the injury he suffered this year where robin lopez blocked him was caused by him flopping on his back to sell contact and accidentally landed on his right heel, you cannot tell me that kind of flopping can continue to happen and he’ll be perfectly ok"
I hear Robin Lopez has a list
"He's just like Robin Lopez. Thoughtful, funny, politically intelligent, and a guy that just makes other people around him feel good."
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
The thing about robin lopez is that he’s a genius and a hero.
Full season: Robin Lopez   Post season: Brook Lopez
Robin Lopez also had a very witty response in the midst of all this lol
I'm a big fan of the one about if Robin and Brook Lopez were combined into one mega twin
Robin Lopez hazing the Orlando rookies by holding a book circle will be equal parts torture and education.
"Yeah the Lopez brothers were the same on the Bay, Robin really fucked up some DnD campaigns back in the day"
That was Robin Lopez making fun of the anti-vaxxers.
Wasn't that Brook Lopez to his brother Robin?
[Twitter] Robin Lopez says his “back is definitely against the wall” but will keep fighting for what he believes is right in regards to who won the 2021 NBA Finals
"[http://instreetclothes.com/2021/09/27/understanding-zion-williamsons-foot-fracture/](http://instreetclothes.com/2021/09/27/understanding-zion-williamsons-foot-fracture/)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;However, there may be multiple reasons for optimism surrounding Zion. To start, a 2016 study revealed NBA players to suffer Jones fractures did not display a decrease in performance when they returned to play. Furthermore, Aaron Nelson and the Pelicans medical staff have had a positive impact on player health since joining New Orleans, including last season when they finished in the top 10 for fewest games lost to injury or illness. Nelson also has prior success managing fifth metatarsal fractures. In 2009 while leading the well-respected Suns medical team, Nelson and his team worked Robin Lopez back from surgery to fix a fifth metatarsal fracture in just 52 days. Lopez never exhibited any associated setbacks or complications. The variables in the two cases may vary but Williamson is in proven hands."
"Robin Lopez has the best comments, even when he talks about basketball, he says whatever he wants, since it's all harmless jokes."
Robin Lopez
Becoming a huge Robin Lopez fan recently for… reasons.
holy christ i love robin lopez
"Jimmy Butler. So much of his offense is relied on getting free throws. I also hate watching Robin Lopez shoot threes, it just looks weird"
Now is a good time to mention that Robin Lopez has the dopest NBA Top Shot moment.
Robin Lopez is a real life Calvin and Hobbes character
Robin Lopez
"Name a fan base that wouldn't love to have Robin Lopez on their team. Go ahead, I'll wait."
God Bless Robin Lopez…
Robin Lopez definitely has a Reddit account.
Alright..well Robin Lopez if one of my new favorite persons lmao
Robin Lopez is better than Lebron or MJ and I will die on that hill.
"who said Adams was gonna lead the league in rebounds? he still averaged career high rbds per 36 every season since he stopped being teammates w/ Westbrook  what? Westbrook still ball-watched, still sold out on defense, and still never boxed out to get into early rebounding position for uncontested boards. Robin Lopez also famously boxes out for teammates"
"Brooke on the phone with robin rn talkin about early retirement and Lopez-cast. Meanwhile, Bengie and Jose pushin Yadi to retire soon."
"I will say that as much as I like Robin Lopez, if he is your starting C then that is still a weak spot. He's a good back-up level."
Legit thought it was Robin Lopez for a sec but then realized he was moving too quick to be RoLo
Aaron Gordon or robin lopez
"Rodney was a 3/4, beefy and super skilled. Great shot, never seemed to settle into a particular role with a particular team. kind of like bjelica but with less playmaking.  Kurt Thomas was a 4/5, like others have said, defense, screens, rebounds, toughness. very average but in a good way, like robin lopez.  young crawford was basically the same as old crawford. crazy handle, scores in bunches, doesn't give you much on defense, can't/shouldn't be the main ballhandler for too long, nice shot."
"My observation is that refs seem to often make calls late in the game not to elevate a (usually big market) team to a win if they’re down, but to *afford them a chance to win the game*. A couple egregious examples that come to mind are Lebron’s and the cavs’ season opener against the bulls some years ago. Tight game late in the fourth, bulls have the ball, robin Lopez  gets both of his arms batted down by Lebron in front of *three officials*, no call. Cavs make a shit at the other end to take the lead and ultimately win the game. Another insane example is last year when the grizzlies were saucing up the cavs and were up big in the second quarter. Somehow, some way, the grizzlies get called for seven consecutive fouls to finish off the half, and oh yeah, [this happened](https://streamable.com/0ry2c0) in the midst of all that. Really you could even call superstar favoritism a form of rigging."
Or Robin Lopez
"Drummond hit Naz's elbow and the refs said clean block in the first half. We really need 1 more bench big to help Naz though, find me someone like Robin Lopez."
"Robin Lopez coming back to Milwaukee after getting waived, bucks dominating offensive boards and paint defense on the way to another championship."
"If robin Lopez is tradeable, then lebron james is tradable"
Robin Lopez
"Yeah I’d love for us to go out and get Robin Lopez again. To me, he’s the perfect backup 5. Decent offense, solid defense, good locker room guy, no ego, big as fuck."
Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez was the last fight that wasn't just a hold me back bro contest
Robin Lopez and Serge Ibaka!
They retired. No longer have that crown. I don’t think Robin and Brook Lopez Is there
"fr just go get Robin Lopez or something  If they need a FA get Biyombo/Kornet/O'Quinn  There are guys out there that can at least pretend to be a backup C for a few minutes a game before Lopez comes back, Giannis as a full-time C in the regular season just seems dumb"
"Agreed. SGA, Giddey and Dort are the keepers in your side.  Add a competent big man (eg Robin Lopez) and a decent wing (eg Donte diVicenzo) and another year of growing and learning and IMO OKC are close to a 40 win side, and still with a mountain of draft picks.  But a key is to spend those draft picks for steady upgrades on good roleplayers with a skill set you need, so you arent continually bringing in and abandoning rookies aka The Process."
Robin Lopez. Lol jk. I don’t think Brook is going anywhere the next 2-3 years.
See if Robin Lopez wore this it would be awesome
Fun fact. Robin lopez is +34 in the last two games against the bucks while the the Magic lost by 9 and 31
They just wanted to give the Bucks a head start before unleashing Robin Lopez.  Why Mo Wagner is getting minutes over him still confuses me
And Robin Lopez at center. That just leaves SF and SG.
‘Fuck kind of a name is Wobin?’ - Robin Lopez origin story flash back right before he tears into these poor guys.
Ibaka and Robin Lopez legit threw fists a few years back. This is probably the realest thing since then.
Robin Lopez would make quick work of these fuckin bozos
Robin Lopez is DROOLING watching this
"Except this is Lebron, not marquise Chris or robin lopez   And like you said the punch didn’t land.   It would be career suicide if he followed through"
"I've seen it happen in Sac every year, and I assume other teams do it too, but when a mascot has a birthday, they get a bunch of other mascots from around the league to come participate in the shenanigans.  One year in Sac, it coincided with a game Robin Lopez was playing in, and that was glorious."
Robin Lopez is a national treasure. I wish they made another like him….

I'm upset there aren't more players like Robin Lopez.
I'd love Robin Lopez.
"Idk, he did dunk on Robin Lopez and talk shit to him a couple years ago. I'm just gonna ignore the part where he ran away afterwards lol"
RJ Hampton didn't get the memo that his team was being blown out. The end of the game was hilarious with Robin Lopez shushing a ref. Pure gold. My favorite loss ever as a Magic fan.
Robin 'The Silencer™' Lopez
What did the NBA do to deserve Robin Lopez.
Robin Lopez is the only acceptable answer
I fucking love Robin Lopez
"Post Giannis bullying Robin Lopez, that move was wrong."
I’m hoping we can ship Semi for Robin Lopez or any big
I would LOVE Robin Lopez on the Celtics. We need rebounding plus he just rocks as a dude.
Because Robin Lopez doesn't play for us anymore. Other team's mascots can show up safely.
Lucky we didnt bust out Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez deserves to be in the Hall of Fame just on his jokes alone.
Maybe it’s because the post is a Robin Lopez quote? Idk…
Robin Lopez is inspiring our next generation of smart asses.    #GodBlessRolo
"Looks like you weren't on the Warriors sub during last season and this offseason lol. Half the sub was raring to trade Wiseman for a used pack of gum, just because he sucked last season. There are still some holdovers too, I literally just saw someone suggesting that Warriors might trade Wiseman for Robin Lopez. So yeah, Warriors ""fans"" aren't any more patient IMO."
"I'm a diehard fan too &amp; disagree with you wholeheartedly so I guess it's a wash.  Yeah Lavine improved no doubt but dude the empty stats narratives were pretty crazy dude. &amp; I'm not just saying this now, I said it then &amp; took flak for it.  The empty stats stuff has always been overrated &amp; HEAVILY dependent on context. If it's so easy to put up great stats on a bad team why did FVV who we know is a dog lay a massive egg last year in comparison to normal?    In my opinion, if you want to make the empty stats case you have to pair it with an explanation of why. (For example, ""Baylor ran the Grinnell system for Raymond which naturally inflated his numbers"", ""UT sucked but they had Shaq in the post who demanded so many double teams most of Johnny's shots were open"", ""Denver ran a 7SOL system and often didn't even get back on defense""), etc.)   There is no argument to be made like that for Lavine. There's no gimmick.   Dude literally had the worst coach in possibly NBA history who actively turned his nose up at the way modern NBA offenses were run (Literally was screaming at our team in Brooklyn to ""Slow Down!"" and take less 3's) &amp; horrible supporting cast that provided 0 offense. (Robin Lopez was probably our #2 or #3 one year and was the best on the team at it.) This wasn't a situation where the team was tailored around his stats, it basically did everything they could to hinder them.    Like I just don't see how Lavine seeing significantly more defensive attention than he does now is supposed to have been an easier environment to put up stats? It seems counter intuitive to everything I personally watched and just basic common sense."
"Having a healthy environment is an essential part of developing players. There's a reason the Magic have Robin Lopez, Ross and Harris. There's a reason the Pistons have Grant and Olynyk. You can tank, but you need to have at least an environment when you are trying to win. Losing take a toll, being blown out night in and out as well, young players will either get bothered and hinder development as a collective unit or will coast through the season because ""fuck it, we'll lose anyway"".   You have at least 5 teams actively tanking in the NBA. 6, if you want to count both the Spurs and the Thunder (don't think the Wolves are tanking, tbh. They're just not good. Same applies to the Pels without their core). All of them have veterans on the court, to guide young players and at least try to teach them how to win. Losing mentality is a plague."
Oh. In that case we should add Robin Lopez to the list.
"That Blazers team that had Dame, Wesley Matthews, Batum, Aldridge, and Robin Lopez"
Only other ones worth mentioning is maybe Robin Lopez and antetokounmpo
"There are about 42 million people in the Yoruba tribe, so this is kinda like saying ""Westbrook, Lillard, Kawhi, Paul George, Brooke and Robin Lopez, James Harden, Reggie Miller, Klay Thompson, and the Ball Brothers are all from California."""
You mean because AD refused to play center and we had to trade Robin Lopez to get Tyreke Hill in a sign and trade. How bout Eric Gordon and Boogie. The Pelicans may be cursed by horrific injury luck but you can never say they didn’t try and the only thing outsiders like yourself can look at is hindsight.
"Russ was doing too much, but let's go over what he was working with outside of Beal:  Bryant: played 10 games  Rui: credited Russ with improving, literally your third best player as a second year player that isn't playing at all this year  Bertans: injured and played awful, was meant to be one of your key pieces  Deni Avdija: was one of your better players even though he didn't get much playing time. This is sad, he was a rookie that mostly brought defensive help.  Ish Smith: Ish is a solid backup PG, isn't meant to be more.  Alex Len: god awful  Robin Lopez: He's washed at this stage  Garrison Matthews: Started 24 games, played in 64, and is now in the G-league.   Gafford came in late into the year and they were winning.   Covid and injuries were not the cherry on top, your team was garbage.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2021.html  You can go through your own team and tell me how I'm wrong.  Outside of Beal you guys basically have none of your core players from last year and the majority of your core players from last year sucked. You replaced Russ with quality depth, adding in 3 new players, Gafford became a starter, you signed Dinwiddie, and Bertans isn't expected to be one of your best players anymore opposed to a damn 10th man even though he's being paid 17 million.  Russ and beal both played hero ball as your team was trash, quite literally.  Lakers this year, without Lebron, are again not really the best team because we went in on 3 guys and old players and the inconsistency to start the season is massive. Russ isn't a superstar anymore, but the problems go far deeper than him."
Hey robin Lopez is a good player. I will accept no rolo slander here
"- I mean we were 17-6 after we acquired Gafford last year. Much better than running Mo Wagner, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len.  - Westbrook lost us at least 5 games at the beginning of the season, and Scott Brooks probably lost us another 5-10 with his poor lineup managed, inability to coach in the last few minutes, and pure incompetence.  - We added Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell ... in place of Westbrook, Matthews, Bonga/Hutchison, and Lopez/Len. Big boost in quality role players.   - We still haven't seen Thomas Bryant or Rui Hachimura this year.   - Bertans has been out awhile  - Beal has actually been playing like ass, we should get better when he's on form again."
Robin Lopez with Trezz
free robin lopez
Robin Lopez wins it for the Magic
"Reggie Bullock under, and Robin Lopez over were my last season picks. Ofcourse depending on teams they play if they play against good defending Bullock under if not i skip him, for Robin Lopez he was more less safe pick since he had a lot of touches in post and line was something like 6.5 or 7.5 for more than half of the season."
Robin Lopez rounds out the list
"Trade Dwight Powell for Dragic, get Robin Lopez from Magic."
Mavs could use Robin Lopez.
Chicago needs to go and get Robin lopez. Rolo solves so many problems
So would I. Robin Lopez would be a starter in the Mavs with ease. Also fits in our TPE.  My plan B if Presti asks for a ceremonial 1st for Favors.
I think the Bucks would happily trade for Robin Lopez once his contract is available.
I'd never thought I'd want this player but with how Plumlee has been playing I would welcome Robin Lopez with open arms
Well nobody is having an all out fist fight on the court unless it’s some crazy fuck like Robin Lopez.   Everybody knows what’s a stake and that there’s hundreds of cameras on them out there
Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez ain't scared to throw hands either
"Thare are certain teams who gets a free pass on shady things that big market teams just can't do due to its visibility. Like the year leading to the Doncic Draft the Bulls were issued a warning for tanking for benching Robin ""freaking"" Lopez without a reason meanwhile Okc last year sat a perfectly healty SGA and Horford out of game to tank and no one in the NBA objected anything."
Remembered when he and Robin Lopez traded air punches. He just barely missed Lopez's face that time.
If you've actually thrown punches that puts you ahead of 99% of the league. So robin lopez and serge ibaka would be my picks
Robin Lopez will swing on you.
Robin Lopez vs Embiid
1 game max if that. Pretty sure Ibaka got 1 game for nearly decapitating Robin Lopez a couple years ago.
Well there are basically no vets to play. T Ross is a traditional 6th man and Gary Harris serves 0 purpose on the team. Next up is like Mo Wagner and Robin Lopez.  We shipped out 3 starters who are all vets. Plus issac and Fultz are hurt. Cliffords job was to win games and keep his job. Mosley’s job is to develop young guys and play them
He tore his meniscus doing that to robin lopez in game 4
Robin Lopez
Followed the link and unsurprisingly robin lopez is the blazers all time leader in offensive rating
"Robin Lopez and serge, and VC on garnett at the Olympics are honorable mentions"
Robin Lopez wore one pair for a whole season recently and they were pretty munted but not as bad as you’d expect
"Lol well that's all anyone has to do to become elite.. hey Robin Lopez, you just need to make yourself dangerous in other ways and congrats you are now as good as Jokic"
Peyton also has the comedy he can provide. Eli isnt bad but Im mainly in it for Peyton. His SNL stint is one of the best.  Jamal and Quentin do not provide that. Maybe in the future a team like Robin/Brooke Lopez could kind of have that role. Obviously not as accomplished as the Mannings but Robin could provide light heartedness and Brooke more serious. And ofc the brother dynamic.
He's right but why is Robin Lopez bringing this to our attention
"“You hear about surf boarding and to a lesser extent boogie boarding, but sand castles. Sandcastles are the expression of mind, body, and soul the way the other sports aren’t” - Robin Lopez"
I bet anything a lot of sonic fans are representing a robin lopez jersey soon lol
"Can I get a Robin Lopez podcast please, I love when he talks about nerd stuff like this"
Suggs is like 6’5 and None of our bigs outside of Robin Lopez is 7 feet tall.  But the dual center lineup hopefully ends once Isaac comes back.
Yeah it haven't thought about that story in a while. I even remember the Robin Lopez part now that you mention it. That was a crazy story.
Man I remember this a couple of the players wanted to report Boylen to the players association but Robin Lopez had to convince them not to. It was really wild like something out of a movie
"Assist to turnover ratio is a bad stat, TS% is nearly meaningless without volume (Robin Lopez was not a better scorer than Jokic last year despite having a better TS% at the same position), and positions are too fluid to create meaningful positional averages."
"That face when Alex Len is 100x more valuable than the 4 other top-10 picks (Jalen Smith \[10\], Josh Jackson \[4\], Dragan Bender \[4\], Marquese Chriss \[7\]) in the past 15 years the Suns have had combined.  Apparently the Suns just need to draft in the low-teens from now on.  * Cam Johnson -- 11th pick 2019 * Devin Booker -- 13th pick 2015 * TJ Warren -- 14th pick 2014 * Kendall Marshall -- 13th pick 2012  (Fucking eww, never knew why we did this) * Markieff Morris -- 13th pick 2011 (Even with him being a dickhead, he's still a serviceable NBA player) * Earl Clark -- 14th pick 2009 (We held out hope for so long on him) * Robin Lopez -- 15th pick 2008 (We bitched about him so much until we lost him and had Len as a starter, who we bitched about until we lost him and had continuous garbage as starters until Ayton)"
"He has terrible footwork now. He did everything based off speed and power, that never really had the basic down pat. He's gotta remake himself and try lower his weight and strictly work on footwork   Guys like robin lopez Still have jobs because they've worked more in their footwork and worked on their inside game. Robin Lopez's got damn hook shot killed my Mavs last season"
"Oh, so that's where Captain Hook is this year. Robin Lopez is a great dude, I miss him."
No.  He sucks at staggering.  No reason we don't have one of Suggs or Cole on the court at all times.  The Blazers  used to do it with CJ and Dame.  They both don't need to be so attached at the hip.  Don't get me started on the abomination of Robin Lopez and Mo Bamba lineups.
I have a signed game worn Robin Lopez Knicks jersey
who isnt fun to watch when they go off. lol. maybe robin lopez i guess
Where’s Robin Lopez.
"How is this a relevant comment? No one is telling you to not leave Russ hate comments or criticism if that's what floats your boat. But at least keep the Russ hate or criticism gone from the threads that ultimately have nothing to do with him.  You see this play involving Ish Smith and Robin Lopez but simply because Russ is there in the video you had to make it about him, that's sad."
I don’t think that’s really on Ish or Robin Lopez tho. He left a team that had spacing too. This is just WB. Great player &amp; still athletic but his game is limited to drives now and if he isn’t getting the lane or creating it he’s not as valuable.
Jarrett Allen is properly rated maybe even overrated. He got bullied by Thomas Bryant and Robin Lopez last game.
Brook Lopez and Robin Lopez
Why does Tyler Johnson now look like a short Robin Lopez?
Lmao. Kyrie gifts them the ball &amp; Robin Lopez just lags like that. Wtf?
Robin Lopez my boi is still a useful rim protector. Just hope Nets wont realize to abuse him in PnR later.
"Russ with terrible shot selection the last 2 minutes  and our clown of a coach put in Ish Smith, Jerome Robinson, and Robin Lopez on the floor with him   ... WHY"
Robin Lopez is playing 15 min/g. You really gonna pin this all on him?
"His legs aren’t cooked at all. Hilarious how blogbois love to act like he’s not athletic just because he gets maintenance touch ups on his knees in the off-season. He’s not 22 anymore, but his speed and vertical are still very much present. The wizards play 3 guards and Robin Lopez when he’s on the floor or force Russ to wait for a Beal curl screen. In either case, Russ can’t drive due to spacing or the restrictions of the drawn-up play respectively."
"The Wizards have shooters. They aren't being utilized correctly. See below with 2019 3p % stats:  Bertrans (42.4%), Beal (35.3%), Neto (38.6% and 45% this season so far), Bryant (40.7%), Rui (28.7% but shooting 100% this year so far), Deni (NA but shooting 47.6% this year so far) can all shoot and probably in that order for efficiency  Then you have guys like: Troy Brown Jr (34.1%), Isaac Bonga (35.2%), Ish Smith (36.7%), Robin Lopez (33.3%), Moritz Wagner (31.3%), Anthony Gill (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason), and Garrison Matthews (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason)  All these dudes can shoot too.  The problem is you need some semblance of an offensive scheme generating semi-open looks and the Wizards don't have that."
He might be cooked but Scotty is playing him with ish smith and Robin Lopez. He’s not getting enough space.
He may just be washed but he’s also not being played in the right lineups. Scotty is playing him with ish smith and Robin Lopez which gives him no space to go to the rim. I wanna see him play with better shooting lineups before making any conclusions.
It’s hard to do anything as Russ when Scotty is putting Russ in with w other PG who can’t defend and Robin Lopez lol he has no shooters around so he’s forced to take tough shots
"Robin Lopez is the classic Scott Brooks ""let's play the washed up vet over the unproven young guys"" like playing 40 years old Derek Fisher over Jeremy Lamb and Kendrick Perkins over Steven Adams"
Yeah i seriously dont understand. Also paying robin lopez. Defninitely need to find a defensive big by trade deadline.
"For all those saying Joel Embiid, come back when he can play more than 64 games in a season. Don’t get me wrong, his stats are pretty good, actually really good, but when he can play(not start, just play) more games, like KAT, Jokic, Bam, and he’ll even Brook and Robin Lopez, then he’ll be the best in the league by a loooooonnnnnggg shot. Until then I’m still going to say Joel Embiid."
"Honestly it kinda has to do with lineups sometimes.. I only follow occasionally when other games are on commercial but I’m seeing rotations of RW, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Jerome Robinson, and Robin Lopez???? Like Beal, Hachimura, Bryant, Avidja, Bertans are ALL on the bench. You’re telling me Brooks can’t rotate a couple of these dudes to play with Westbrook? I swear I’ve seen RW/Smith/Neto a handful of times and I’m just... so confused."
"I dunno they looked good against us. Just looking at their per game stats seems like the roto is kind've a mess. I would have wagner and T.Bryant as my 5s. You rotate Rui, Bertans, Deni, Bonga at forward. You have Neto and Troy brown as your backup guards. I dunno that there's room in the roto for ish smith and robin lopez. Is wagner hurt? He's a pretty good player and kind've the perfect 5 to pair with Russ, he played game 1 but looks like he's hurt or out of the roto now. He's a dog and a switchy defender who's a better offensive than defensive player. He's not a star but he's a good role player you can pair with Russ in 2nd units.   They haven't been completely healthy yet but this is a decent roster with the right pieces to put around russ. Brooks should get fired if he can't figure out decent lineups with this personnel."
Its Brook Lopez.   Robin Lopez is in the GLeague
Am I the only one waiting for him to snip that shit off? Hasn’t Robin Lopez even cut his?
"“Remember the 5 D's of basketball: Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge”  - Robin Lopez"
"Notable players you forgot for the Suns were Leandro Barbosa, Stromile Swift, Matt Barnes, and Robin Lopez.  Notable players you forgot for the Spurs were Boris Diaw, Danny Green, and Patty Mills."
How are you spinning the Jerian Grant/Robin Lopez/Jose Calderon trade that landed the Knicks a former MVP?
"If you look at the NBA stats by play type and filter by points per possession, then only look at those for whom post ups represent 20% or more of their shots, you get a pretty good list.  Some surprises:  - Robin Lopez is more effective in the post than Brook. Also more effective than KAT, Jokic and Vuc. He’s flat out one of the best post scorer this season.  - LMA with the Nets (small sample) had been the second best post scorer this season, behind only Embiid.  - Melo is taking near a quarter of his shots in the post this year.  - Other lesser thought of names high on this list include JV, Ayton, Okafor and Trez"
Robin lopez against us
Captain Hook himself Robin Lopez

Robin Lopez
"Yikes, I remember a Bulls fan that said he was good when he had Robin Lopez covering for him but that was like two years back when he averaged 26 for a month."
Robin Lopez and Alex Len don’t have much mobility. If they contest a shot or have to box out a center they’re likely not getting the board. Usually either Russ or deni get the rebound. I would say deni has better positioning but Russ gets up for most of his boards and chases them
Gaffords energy and athleticism is such a nice change of pace from Robin Lopez and Alex Lens lumbering. Dude is definitely making a case to get most of the C minutes the rest of the year and into next
Robin Lopez and Alex Len\*
"where did this dude come from and why did they trade him  Also, who knew that the Wiz needed a big that's not Robin Lopez and Mo Wagner"
"Stoudemire was a soon to be free agent like Lebron, but he wanted a long-term max contract that most teams around the league didn't want to give him--including both Phoenix and Cleveland--because he was already 27. As a result, Phoenix was concerned Stoudemire would walk in free agency so they were shopping him.   &gt;Earlier, Stoudemire's agent Happy Walters told The Associated Press that it would make no sense for the Phoenix Suns not to trade Stoudemire only to see him walk away as a free agent at the end of the season.  &gt;Stoudemire also said ""the door is open"" for talks on a long-term contract with Phoenix.  &gt;""I can remain with this team another five years or I can be elsewhere another five years,"" he said. ""We're not sure what's going to happen, but my ultimate goal is to eventually contend for a championship and get the best out of our team.""  &gt;The Suns are not likely to want a contract that extends five years.  &gt;Stoudemire also could decide not to opt out of the contract and take the $17.7 million, becoming a free agent after one more season with Phoenix. No team probably would match that figure in any long-term deal.  Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4922486  Trading Stoudemire for Hickson would have also brought the Suns down below the luxury tax. It's why they traded Shaq to the Cavs originally they were dumping salary at the time. And in that Shaq trade the Suns wanted Hickson but Gilbert refused.  &gt;The Cavs and Suns talked about Hickson in the O'Neal deal, but the Cavs wanted to keep him. So the Suns have a history of interest in Hickson. They also considered drafting him in 2008 but took Robin Lopez instead.  Source: https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2010/01/cleveland_cavaliers_and_phoeni_1.html  &gt;The Suns are believed to like Cavaliers forward J.J. Hickson, whom they considered drafting in 2008 and is currently having a breakout sophomore season. The Cavs, however, have been reluctant to include Hickson in trade talks.  Source: https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2010/02/cleveland_cavaliers_intensify.html  Gilbert's backup plan if Lebron left was building around JJ Hickson, so he wouldn't trade him. Getting Stoudemire who was also a soon-to-be free agent but probably not worth a long-term max deal also didn't interest Gilbert. So it didn't happen. Lebron left and the Cavs built around Hickson.  This scenario played out again in Lebron's last year in Cleveland the 2nd time around too. Lebron wanted the Cavs to trade the 8th pick for Deandre Jordan. Dan Gilbert refused because his plan was to build around the 8th pick (Colin Sexton) if Lebron leaves. Lebron left. The Cavs are building around Colin Sexton."
I completely forgot the blazers had robin Lopez. Great read by the way
Robin Lopez an Brook Lopez were born on the same day!
"Based on the title, I thought this would involve Robin Lopez, so I’m not impressed."
"Why do you say that? It was obvious to anyone that Lillard was going to be the face of the franchise. But at the same time Paul Allen was willing to break the bank to resign not only Aldridge, but also post Achilles Wes Matthews and ho hum Robin Lopez, and to contine to slightly overpay Nic Batum.  Aldridge was the one unwilling to be second banana and left during free agency, forcing Portland into jettisoning their entire starting lineup to rebuild right away. He didn't even have the courtesy to inform the blazers that he was leaving so they could at least try to do a trade at the deadline to get some assets back. He even left the blazers dangling all the way to the beginning of free agency,  Kawhi style, making it look like he might resign, before dipping.   Portland was 100% committed to winning with Aldridge, backed up by the endless coffers of the then wealthiest owner in the league. It was al on LMA, who decided to leave on his own accord."
"And if they had signed like Robin Lopez instead of drafting James Wiseman they'd have a much better record than that.  Doesn't seem like people are appreciating the extra degree of difficulty of winning with a high school center on the roster. None of the recent ""carry jobs"" have had to do anything like that except LeBron who went 28-27 with a lot of young teammates in 2018-2019 in LA (and those guys were a lot more NBA ready than Wiseman)."
there are two shots that never miss  1. steph curry 3 after fumbling the ball  2. robin lopez hook shot
"I still disagree about the fit part. If anything the washington fit is worse because they are such a bad 3pt shooting team that doesnt prioritize spacing at all to maximize russ in an age where spacing is everything. Ive watched my share of wizards games and russ can never drive like he did last season because the paint is always clogged by robin lopez, len, or even hachimura.   Meanwhile in Houston we saw Russ at his best, obviously he isnt washed but he clearly isnt as good as he was with Houston. Maybe if washington could space the floor better and play russ with better lineups and overall better schemes it may work but I still believe his quad injuries hampered his play."
"No, ask Robin Lopez"
"lol and he looked like shit. You know you can put up stats and get embarrassed, right? Dudes look at numbers and think ""Oh yeah, I know exactly what happened"" don't need to watch the series or understand the context. Congrats on putting up 27 on Robin Lopez and Thomas Robinson and a defensive scheme set up to allow you to score and built around successfully stopping Harden."
Robin Lopez is also a big box out guy
"The difference is that brogdon really played a different role on bucks than Bledsoe or Jrue. Brogdon would be in Divencenzo’s spot. Jrue is basically Bledsoe but better in all ways. Brogdon is just a different kind of player all together. It really wasn’t brogdon vs Bledsoe. It was Brogdon vs Matthew’s + hill + Robin Lopez. The bucks chose depth over a better starting rotation. It was the wrong choice. This year they did the opposite. Bucks depth is greatly harmed, but our starting lineup is better. A Jrue-Brogdon lineup with DD off bench would have been ideal."
"At one point when he was on the Bulls, a Robin Lopez hook shot was the best case scenario for our offense."
HOLY SHIT BUCKS WHERE IS THE HELPER AT THE RIM  WAKE UP ROBIN LOPEZ WHATS BAM H GONNA DO. OH MY GOD THESE FUCKING TEAMS

"U know looney gets paid more than noel and even robin lopez?., like warriors GM is an idiot"
Lol stop it. Now people are acting like they haven't been making fun of the wizards roster for 2 straight years just because it fits their narrative. The only wizard to play 70 games was Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
"The Wizards have Russ, Brad, Rui, Ish, Neto, Deni, that's 6. If you're including post shot creation Robin Lopez makes 7."
"I can understand why, in general, a coach would be reluctant to just hand over starter minutes to a guy who was a throwaway piece in a trade a couple months ago...but the guys Gafford are competing with are Robin Lopez (solid but unspectacular vet) and Alex Len (certifiable scrub).  Gafford was awesome last night and he should be on the floor 30 minutes, especially when Westbrook is on the court and can toss him lobs.  I don't know what is keeping Brooks from realizing this."
I don't think Robin Lopez is a good post defender
Robin Lopez should be starting and Alex Len should be left in a locker
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Alex len robin lopez and daniel gafford will attempt to stop embiid sixers in 5 lol

Alex Len should be in 3rd at the Center rotation behind Robin Lopez but you know just Scott Brooks things
Robin Lopez
"Of course I believe it. I also believe David Stern suspended Jordan for gambling, he didn’t “retire”, the Knicks lottery envelope was frozen, and Robin Lopez is secretly a furry."
Robin '183 triple doubles' Lopez
They were giving Robin Lopez chants too lmao stop being weird
Gafford with more court time than Robin Lopez and Alex Len combined so far. All is right in Oz.
DPOY robin lopez is on him
If you don't think Robin Lopez is the MVP you don't like NBA basketball
Lol bro the pacers are making Robin fucking Lopez look like a top 5 center.
Are we sure Robin Lopez is not Kosmo Kramer’s bastard son. His hair lol
i love how no ones talking about how robin lopez is outplaying all star domantas sabonis lmao
You mean is Hakeem 80s robin lopez?
Is Robin Lopez prime Hakeem reincarnated?
Robin Lopez BBQ chicken
"Robin ""Kareem"" Lopez!"
2021 the year robin lopez took the wizards to a championship with just hook shots
Does Robin Lopez have the greatest hook shot of all time?
"well the implication was that Washington would try to help their own team, not pay to offload him lol  though now you mention OKC, maybe Horford for Bertans has some merit? They're both clear negative contracts and Washington's been trotting out Robin Lopez and Alex Len at C all year lol"
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
I swear to god last time I saw a clip of Robin Lopez doing a hookshot it was a massive airball
"I honestly would've died if Robin ""the dream"" Lopez carried them out of the deficit with hooks."
"&gt;Cmon man you're a big boy, use your words, be specific. What does ""playing better"" mean?  &gt;What do you think he has Robin Lopez out there for?  Keep dodging the question champ lmao."
"&gt;Cmon man you're a big boy, use your words, be specific. What does ""playing better"" mean?  &gt;What do you think he has Robin Lopez out there for?   Keep dodging the question champ lmao."
"They clearly got the ball to Rolo, given he's not getting shots up if they don't get him the ball in the post. The fact Robin Lopez isos are a clear play for Scott Brooks says a lot, even tho I like Rolo it's a bail out play at best.  But the point is putting RoLo out there is clearly deciding what type of shots the team takes. Him acting as if he understands how coaching works is laughable, this a simple ass concept."
Answer the questions.   What do you think he has Robin Lopez out there for? What do you think he expected from Bertans when he puts him on the floor?
"This a dumbass comment, what do you think he has Robin Lopez out there for? If he's out there, it's literally for his post ups.  What do you think he expected from Bertans? Why do you think he left him out there if not to hit 3s?"
The wizards half court offense in the second half was truly offensive. Who would have thought that running an offense based on robin Lopez post ups wasn’t going to well!?!
Why didn't Scott Brooks play Robin Lopez lots of minutes? The man basically has an ultra-efficient hook shot. Doesn't he want the Wizards to win? Don't you want your team to have as many advantages over the Celtics as possible? Why are you making it easier for the Celtics by not playing Robin Lopez?   Also why was Westbrook passive in this game? I thought he would drive to the paint a lot more.
Robin Lopez has been really good for us this year wtf are you watching?
Not even a game. I’m saying I made a judgment in 10-15 seconds the first time I saw him play in person in Milwaukee. And then tonight is one of many games I’ve watched of Robin Lopez where that initial eye test was confirmed.
"Yes and no. I remember thinking “this dude isn’t going to be on a championship team” the first time I saw both Lopez brothers play. So it’s not based off this game, but it was based off a very quick and initial eye test. Seeing some bad plays from Robin tonight confirmed it for me.   You can have great stats and still fail the eye test IMO"
Is  your eye test only based on one game? Robin Lopez was good for them. He leads the league with hook shot made.
And also the patented Robin Lopez hook!
"You got Westbrook, Beal, Bertans all on a team, and you run your offense through fucking Robin lopez... at least get a mismatch before you do that smdh"
Why is robin lopez getting plays right now? Beal and Westbrook need to go get that rock cuz it’s crunch time.
Brad Beal and Russell Westbrook on the team and we're giving Robin Lopez post touches? C'mon guys
I would not be against robin lopez shaving the back of his neck
Robin Lopez getting posted like he’s Embiid lol
"Down 10, Robin Lopez is getting heavy offensive touches, why?"
Robin Lopez post ups really might be Wizards best offensive option right now. They're struggling out there
I’m so confused as to why when Robin Lopez hits the floor apparently the offense runs through him....
I love how the Wizards offense is being ran through Robin Lopez right now lll
Robin Lopez has one move and it somehow works
"if everything is going wrong, just throw the ball to Robin Lopez in the post"
I have a signed Game-day Robin Lopez Knicks jersey AMA
I can't believe I'm saying this but the Ish Smith and Robin Lopez rotation is the only way the Wiz have a shot tonight.
Where the hell is Robin Lopez
They need Robin Lopez for offense. I'm being serious.
There is nobody who pivots like Robin lopez
Robin Lopez is not worse than Len
I have a question - the Westbrook haters used to say that the only reason he got those triple doubles in OKC was because Steven Adams let him.  Does the same argument apply to Washington and with Robin Lopez?  Or will they just admit the man is incredible?
celtics should win this game if Beal cant go much...but Robin Lopez may be prime Hakeem so idk
"Wow, Robin Lopez is way better than Alex Len. Who knew?"
"Westbrook and Beal should put him in a mascot costume, and get Robin Lopez to deal with him"
Robin Lopez looks like the asparagus from veggie tales
Are we sure Kareem wasn’t just Robin Lopez with a green light?
A SPECTACULAR MOVE BY ROBIN LOPEZ
I swear Robin Lopez hits 100% percent of those little hook shots
r/NBA about to learn the secret that Robin Lopez is the 2nd coming of KAJ
Robin Lopez is like the NBA version of a mean Hodor
Robin Lopez is the second coming of Hakeem!
Robin “Kareem” Lopez
Robin Lopez is a fucking caveman
looking forward to Robin Lopez jump hooks
That’s Phoenix suns legend Alex Len! SMH Also I just realized that he and robin lopez were both drafted by the suns.
Start Robin Lopez please
Y'all starting Alex Len when Robin Lopez is right there smfh I need my damn FANTASY POINTS I PICKED LOPEZ
Robin lopez
"And then they allowed teams to tank at an unprecedented level anyways.   Was that Sixers team allowed to send their second best player home, a proven winner, because hey he doesn’t feel like playing for this team right now and we want to “develop players”.   It was a joke this year. Three years ago the Bulls were forced to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday.   How much better is Horford than those two?   A ton"
"The Lopez Brothers are hilarious lmao. Like in the Charlotte game Robin was just cooking in the post like a top 5 center, it was hilarious to watch."
how dare you disrespect Robin Lopez and his ability to pull 20 a night
"I fucking hope Gafford plays 20mpg  I know Brooks would opt for the vet Robin Lopez which im fine with, but at least dont give Len more than 5 mins 😒"
"I'd give Westbrook All-NBA before Beal. Beal's a great player, but I don't think it's a coincidence that the Wizards started winning when Russ got healthy and flipped the triple-double switch. To me, Russ' playmaking has done more to get the Wizards' other players involved than Beal's scoring. Players like Daniel Gafford, Davis Bertans, Robin Lopez, Garrison Matthews (when he plays) all noticeably got better with Russ playing well. Beal's the Klay Thompson of this team, but Russ is the Steph Curry."

"Robin Lopez and Gafford are so high on contested rebounds because they're fighting Westbrook for them, lol. Jk obviously"
Wtf are you talking about? Robin Lopez leads the NBA in all time triple doubles??
Bulls were forced to bring back all time greats Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday by Silver.
Robin Lopez is a treasure...Scottie with the /s in the press conference.
It’s hilarious watching how him and Robin Lopez have played tonight and yet neither started this series until Gafford tonight
robin lopez with the second best sky hook in the game behind KAJ
Robin Lopez: Doesn't miss a hook shot.  Scott Brooks: Guess what we WONT be doing.  Edit: Jinxed him like a mfqr.
I wish Robin Lopez would have clotheslined his ass WWE style like he does the mascots

Clearly he’s emotionally traumatized from being dominated by Robin Lopez

Robin Lopez really feasting rn
Give me robin “abdul-jabbar” lopez over embiid

This is the Matisse Thybulle Robin Lopez shootout we were all expecting
OH MAN ROBIN LOPEZ WHAT IS THIS!!
Robin Lopez is Kareem
I have hard time listening to ppl that don't have Robin Lopez in their top 5.
I see why Robin Lopez has a 96 post hook in 2K.
that Robin Lopez hook shot is too much
Robin Lopez 😂
"AD doesn't want to play Center for significant minutes. Hornets/Pelicans were forced to do this for years with him. After his rookie year, they gave away Robin Lopez to move AD to Center. He didn't like it, so they had to go give assets for Omer Asik.  Then after that didn't work out, they had to go get Cousins."
His prepared bit stumbles are funny too. During game 1 wiz-76ers chuck came out and said Robin Lopez was the difference maker in the first half with 11 points  He had 0 points   Same game where chuck was napping at halftime lmao
Robin Lopez would do it if they were all mascots
"doc rivers: robin lopez and gafford, man they just makes it so tough for our guys, that's how good embiid is, going out there and coming out on top over  great great players, they're like the modern twin towers"
Bledsoe and robin lopez 😄
"George Hill was underrated on that team. He was a solid defender and if we needed a basket he almost always came through.  Jrue is a big part of the transformation but the Bucks upgrading their entire bench isn't talked about enough. This isn't the same team as last year, Only the core players remained. 4 players from last years team played yesterday.  **Players on the bubble team that are not in Milwaukee this time around**.  Eric Bledsoe • George Hill • Wesley Matthews • Marvin Williams • Kyle Korver • Frank Mason • Robin Lopez • Sterling Brown • Ersan Ilyasova • DJ Wilson"
That may not have been the best way to state it. I think losing Robin Lopez was still a negative if they have to face other teams with good bigs where fouls might be an issue. I’d rather have him for 12 min a game vs the 76ers than not if I were the Bucks.
Missed Robin Lopez.
"Bryn Forbes &gt;&gt; Kyle Korver (way past his prime)  Bobby Portis &gt;&gt; Robin Lopez (another rim protector that can shoot the 3)  Jrue Holiday &gt;&gt; Eric Bledsoe (need I say more?)  PJ Tucker &gt; Eran Illyasova (more defense, and more corner threes)  This bucks team is KILLING it with their depth."
Robin lopez didn't do shit for us but yes I agree
"I mostly agree with this other than the bit about Robin Lopez. He was a total nonfactor for us, despite his nice season for Washington."
"That’s easy to do when Alex Len, Daniel Gafford and Robin Lopez are playing defense on you"
"Something that isn’t talked about enough with this Bucks teams bs the ones from 2019/2020 is the way Giannis is playing offball more. In previous years Giannis seemed to always have the ball at the top of the key and he’d just try and bull rush the basket and either muscle up a shot or dish it out for a 3 pointer. This year I’ve seen a lot more of Giannis cutting hard without the ball and it seems to make the offense flow much better than in years past. Certainly the addition of Holiday and Tucker help the team, but they also lost Robin Lopez and Malcolm Brogdon, which were pretty big pieces for them in the past. I think we need to acknowledge that coaching and decision making has also improved and it’s not simply due to personnel changes (though that certainly doesn’t hurt)."
"Ad over gasol   Cp3 over Francis   Not robin Lopez   Anthony Parker!?!? Realize the options limited, but is he your cousin or something ? Andre Miller, Sexton , Garland, Mo Williams, Larry Hughes   Thanks for posting though. Fun to scroll thru"
"Im assuming you left Harden off the nets because you put him on HOU?  Edit: my bad I see you’re only putting a player on their “main” team solid list except robin lopez... also if LMA and Tim Duncan played together, Duncan would be the center"
I’d take Ayton or Shaq over Robin Lopez
Robin lopez 😂
Robin Lopez over Ayton lol.
"Why? Was KG really a Center? He never hesitated once Doc Rivers asked him to play Center. He actually played Center at the end of lockout 2012 season until 2013. KG was indeed capable of Center, while AD on the other bitches all the time he can’t bang up with Robin Lopez or Ayton. KG averaged 20 and 10 during 2012 playoffs run."
"Yeah, that 14-15 team was starting Dame-Matthews-Batum-LMA-Robin Lopez, and we'd just traded for Afflalo to be a 6th man."
Wow Robin Lopez missed a hook shot
Brooks is just stupid. Robin Lopez should start over Len.
"In spring 2011, I went to Disney's Animal Kingdom. Right by the Expedition Everest ride, there was an ice cream cart. I got in line behind two 7' tall white dudes. One of them farted and it started out like it was a goddamn train horn version of a whoopie cushion that petered out into a high pitched squeak over the course of 7 seconds. In the split second separating the fart from the laughter of the two treants in front of me, the smell hit everyone. It was the fastest traveling fart in recorded history, some say that the stench broke the smell/sound barrier. Basically imagine the smell of the rotten anus of a beached whale shortly before the gases cause the intestinal tract to rupture, you've got the smell.    The 7' tall culprit: Robin Lopez. His accomplice: his brother, Brook Lopez."
Was Hakeem (the greatest post scorer IMO) a lower body specimen? No. If KP could develop even a post game like Robin Lopez he would be so much better.
Robin Lopez
"It still feels like it's a scale of ""nobody hates"" and not everyone loves. I'd say everyone loves Robin Lopez."
"The top individual defenders against Jokic this year in no order were Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton (but mostly just in the 3rd/final PHX matchup), Clint Capela (in the first matchup with ATL, not the second), and ROBIN LOPEZ of all people. That's really been it this year."
Surprised that no one has mentioned Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
I'm thinking robin lopez
Robin Lopez
i don't know man. Supreme leader Kevin Love owns the East...Robin Lopez will certainly be crucial in this war
"That Robin Lopez would just be some ordinary center, who knew he would become the face of the league?"
Brook Lopez thinks hes Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
Fucking still pisses me off seeing Robin Lopez on the Bench when all we needed was a rebound.
Robin Lopez
"Randle, RJ, Jordan Poole, Luka, Dillon Brooks, Robin Lopez"
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
"I mean I think you’re being disingenuous if you say that Gary Harris and KCP can do what Ben can do while also saying that Capela can “maybe” do what Gobert can do. If players like KCP are the bar for perimeter defence, guys like Derrick Favours, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Nurkic, Draymond, Poeltl , Gifford, Robin Lopez, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen + more should all count as “acceptable” defensive anchors"
"I found Robin Lopez, who's Brook Lopez"
Robin Lopez
"Although, I remember seeing some Robin Lopez post move highlights recently. That may be it."
1.	Robin Lopez 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Raul Neto 4.	Daniel Gafford 5.	Rui Hachimura
Robin Lopez has the greatest hook shot since Kareem
Someone get the apology form to Robin Lopez
"Brook and Robin lopez spent some time with him. Didn't come back with any new moves the next season.   Only guy that seemed to get anything out of Hakeems workouts was Kobe, which makes sense because most bigs arent agile enough to do the things Hakeem could."
&gt;Do we not remember all of the games he missed while being injured in NOLA?  He wasn't playing C in NOLA either.  They were playing Asik. At some point they had Robin Lopez. And had various other C's.
Drummond lookin like a west coast robin lopez with that shot
He’s no robin lopez
Kyle Kuzma is playing like his girl broke up with him 5 minutes before the game and she told him I like Robin Lopez now.
Hes definitely better than Kobe. And why did you even include Robin Lopez?
"Do you think he’s better than Jordan, Kobe, and the real GOAT, Robin Lopez?"
"This may be a little too political, but I gotta say Robin Lopez"
Probably an unpopular opinion But Robin Lopez is my dark horse pick
"i doubt anyone would ever reach those heights of fame again, especially because Lebron had that star power starting from high school, pre-internet dominant era too.   But if anyone can do it, it's Robin Lopez"
Robin Lopez.
Robin Lopez &gt; Zion
You know there's guys like Luka and Zion that are pretty good but idk I think I gotta go with Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
"Luka Doncic won Euroleague MVP at age 19.  Giannis Antentokoumpo won back to back NBA MVPs by 25.  Russell Westbrook just broke the triple double record this season.  Personally, my money is on Robin Lopez."
"ME- Read the question, rolled my eyes, looked at comments anyways, pleasantly surprised to find all the true fans talking up Robin lopez"
Also Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez.
Robin Lopez
GOAT Robin Lopez would be sick on this team
Probably because The Lopez brothers are both some of the best at boxing out in the league. Giannis rebounds shot up when they acquired Brook. And I remember when the Blazers got Robin LaMarcus Aldridge went from like 8.5 rebounds for his career then he went up to 11 with Robin. Boxing out is a lost art
I want to see how many % of Robin Lopez points is weird hook shots
"I am not sure the Warriors need (key word need) a big contract veteran big. As Draymond can play small ball 5, Warriors really need a center to soak up 20 min or so and slow down some of the bigs in the West (Jokic, AD, Ayton). With the $5M tax payer MLE, there should be a good enough veteran big like Gasol or Robin Lopez (Wizard one. he’s 32 and made $7.3M this past year)."
TIL Robin Lopez is the all-time triple doubles leader
"They had a big… Serge Ibaka is out. Their best player is also out. WCF was a new milestone so thats a good step forward.  I agree Zubac is not it. Nurkic, Howard, and Robin Lopez might be solid choices"
I absolutely believe this. RoLo has [talked about](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2020/07/disneymagicmoments-nba-stars-brook-and-robin-lopez-share-some-of-their-favorite-memories-from-walt-disney-world-resort-visits/) his love of Disney and amusement parks before
"Zubac and Ayton been studying the GOAT, Robin Lopez."
Which led to Robin Lopez perfecting his own hook shot
One of my friends got to know Robin Lopez. This is going to sound like a copy pasta but I swear it’s true. She said he was a really nice guy but a little introverted. She worked at Disneyland and did the queue for the Monsters Inc ride. She said he would ride the ride multiple times in a row. Sometimes he would ride the single ride all day long. She got to know him since he was there so frequently.
Calling Embiid without free throws Robin Lopez is like calling Trae without free throws Dion Waiters. People really hate the Sixers that much that they’re upvoting shit like this lmao
"Nets, Bucks, Knicks, Hawks, Heat, Celtics, Hornets, Raptors, Suns, Nuggets, Clippers, Lakers, Mavericks, Grizzlies, Warriors, Thunder all would pass on the Sixers ""situation.""  Their situation is just having an injury prone foul merchant center who is basically Robin Lopez when he doesnt get a million free throws + a non top 70 player on a max contract (Simmons) + Doc ""3-1 lead, game 7 loser"" Doc Rivers."
Robin Lopez is in that same borderline category.
Robin Lopez
Hope he figures out a way to be just as good and as efficient while moving like Robin Lopez so he doesn't get unnecessary injuries anymore
"And the Bucks sat everyone for the Denver game right before the shut down. They started Wes Mathews, Pat Connaughton, Sterling Brown, Thanasis, and Robin Lopez 🤮"
I imagine he will force a trade to the Wizards so he can team up with Robin Lopez
"Will he? Sometimes it can take a minute to get the rust off and the Nets will be in 100% go mode after losing like this. He’s also one of the most tradeable contracts they got, he probably wants to choose his own situation instead of being Brooklyn’s best trade chip. Like Robin Lopez from last off-season, knew Milwaukee was going to trade him so he left."
"No, it’s robin lopez"
Robin Lopez might look like the caveman but Brook has the intelligence of one
“robin is the better lopez?”  “always has been”
"No clue, if he just developed a Robin Lopez hook shot he would be unstoppable."
What the fuck how can BRUCE brown shoot over Robin lopez
"Yeah I’m sure Carlisle comes in and teaches Eric Bledsoe how to shoot a jumpshot. Ersan Illyasova how to play defense. And Robin Lopez to be a quality playoff rotation big for the first time in his career.  We’re talking about coaches here, not miracle workers"
It's really hard to learn and master unless you're Robin Lopez
Respect to Robin Lopez for his hook and respect to richaun Holmes for his floater
"Eric bledsoe, Ersan Ilyasova, and Robin Lopez.  That team wasn’t shit, they just covered up a lot of deficiencies in the regular season."
"Just like Ben Wallace, when Gobert is getting offensive rebounds and chipping in points off of putbacks, his limited arsenal is somewhat tolerable. The problem with his lack of offense is exacerbated when the Jazz go through a slump with their 3s. Those long rebounds make it near impossible for Gobert to get these easy putback points. Add Conley missing time and now the Jazz are under-utilizing Gobert as a lob threat, taking away yet another one of his few weapons. He doesn't have enough in the tool chest to lose out on these two aspects of his game.     While it would do a world of good for the Jazz if Gobert developed a consistent hook, even if it is the ugly kind we see out of Robin Lopez for example, I wouldn't get my hopes up on that happening at this stage. Putbacks and lobs are about as much as we will see out of him. If Conley stays healthy, Gobert's offensive contributions are at least on the table, since Conley has the midrange game that pairs perfectly for the kind of buckets Gobert is capable of getting. Donovan isn't quite there yet with the playmaking to really use the lob/dump-off to Gobert to full effect, but I would bet he bolsters that aspect of his game."
&gt;So none of those players are bum big men who suck at offence and are massively overpaid.  Gobert isn't an overpaid big man who sucks at offense because..... He... has a high true shooting percentage?? Some of you people need to watch basketball and stop obsessing over stats.  Ivicia Zubac and Robin Lopez were both top 5 in TS% this season too. That's what happens when you never shoot from more than 5 feet. They still suck at offense.
"Jason Kidd, Bill Simmons, Lavar Ball and Robin Lopez if he retires."
"Adams and Kanter were redundant of each other once the league opened up more. They kept Adams because he protects the rim and boxes out at an elite level on top of pretty much never asking for shots. Kanter’s *only* value is as an offensive rebounder/finisher whereas if you have Adams and Horford you have a traditional beat and bang big and you have a small ball 5 who can space the floor more for Russ and KD.   Adams probably doesn’t get a 100 million dollar contract anywhere if he has a season playing off of Horford and KD/Russ because you’re right he probably does go to the bench at that rate. His value only got as high as it did in ‘17 because he was Russ’s Robin the year he went nuclear and won MVP. A lot of what Russ did in ‘17 was enabled by Adams doing a lot of the dirty work, even though we have more context now to see he’s essentially a more capable Robin Lopez type"
"You’ll take one Robin Lopez, and you’ll like it."
honestly. they gotta trade giannis for a better supporting piece. giannis to dc for ish smith and robin lopez
"I mean Giannis wouldn't be as good if he were shorter or skinnier. That being said I think the ""ugliest"" player in the league is Robin Lopez and I wouldn't paint him as conventionally unattractive."
"I ain't gonna lie, its fucking weird that Robin Lopez has got a more consistent skyhook than Giannis. Like, wow, the Lopez are something else"
That's why we signed Robin Lopez. We may or may not use our 15th roster spot on another locker room vet.
He was until Orlando signed Robin Lopez yesterday to a 1 year deal. Ross is currently second oldest

The Magic too because they paid Robin Lopez 5 mil
It’s looking really good after being transferred to Robin Lopez when he plays the Warriors.
"I agree, it wasn't reasonable to think they'd tank again, but they definitely tanked wrong the first time. Remember all those games we played Robin Lopez instead of Felicio lol  So many nights where they were chasing wins instead of benching vets. It was very frustrating.  I still think that tanking again may have been the faster path to a championship, hopefully they're able to swing another big move for a true superstar in the next 2 years."
&gt; But now we're stuck with what Brad Wanamaker? Grant Riller? as the backup. George Hill is worse than both those players  Lol no way man. Brad Wanamaker is terrible and Grant Riller is basically a rookie. George Hill is way better than both of those guys.  Why sign Hayward? You'd make the playoffs if he and Ball were healthy. Why stretch Batum? He was total trash for you and was going to remain trash.  They haven't been perfect but man I just think you're totally wrong on all of these things.  Plumlee sucks dude. Would have been better off with Robin Lopez.

List ended at Robin Lopez when I checked 🤨
"Oh believe me not I only do I not care, I actually prefer it this way lmao. If this dogshit sub was praising every move the Knicks made then I’d know we’re fucked.   Go back and look at the r/nba brain trust reaction to the hiring of Leon Rose, the hiring of Thibs, the draft selection of Immanuel Quickley, and the trade to bring back Derrick Rose lol. This place couldn’t be more clueless if it tried.  My thing with Nerlens is I wanted some diversity with our bigs because him and Mitch are very similar in a lot of ways. I was hoping to maybe bring back Robin Lopez on a 1 year $6M deal or something to have a big who can bang down low in the post. But Nerlens is good and the contract should be moveable so it’s fine."
"There is a difference between ""lonzo expects to get 80 million from the bulls once free agency opens"" and ""bucks expect to get Bogdan for Robin Lopez and x in a sign and trade with the kings. Bogdan will then get x milliom dollars over x years"""
"I did make that up, but id imagine 3 has to be close to the record   Trying to think of some brother combos that theoretically could have overlapped in the past:   Giannis/Thanasis   Robin/Brook Lopez  Marcus/Markieff Morris  Plumlees  Zellers"
Agreed Riley knows better than to throw that out there as a starting lineup. IMO you guys need a 3nD PF like Bobby Portis or a Defensive Hustle C like Robin Lopez and Bring back Dedmon
"Yeah like Westbrook put up nearly 12 apg last year feeding Daniel Gafford, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len. People saying he won’t help or even will hurt one of the best big men in the league are lunatics"
Wes Matthews and Robin Lopez coming back too.
You forgot Robin Lopez hook shot SMH
Because we had traded Robin Lopez for DRose and Noah tried to do a pull-up on Phil’s shoulder to prove his strength
Keep Collins. Find a backup pg for Trae. Either Lou Williams or any other competent guard. Backup center is needed as well....maybe like Theis or Robin Lopez if the price is on the low end.
Unironically wish the US had Brook or Robin Lopez
Unironically wish we had Brook Lopez. Or even Robin.
Yes we did. The coaching environment for him wasn’t great but that wasn’t the reason he regressed. It was getting rid of Robin Lopez. RoLo would constantly box out for him so he could get rebounds which is why his rebound numbers were so good his rookie year. Watching every game last year he seemed very hesitant to drive in the post or run a PnR. He completely moved away from his signifier drag step he used to have and he has developed this weird habit of attempting to poster people and blowing it. He will likely succeed in a different environment but a lot of his blunders with us are on him.
Robin Lopez would like a word with u
"They’re upgrades for the Wizards and are all going to be able to do more given a bigger role. Washington’s bench was Ish Smith, Raul Neto and Robin Lopez in the playoffs."
We'll swap you Aaron Holiday for Middleton and throw in Robin Lopez for good measure
but instead the Wizards have the discount Bucks lineup with Robin Lopez and Aaron Holliday. They just gotta get Thanasis or Alex Antetokounmpo now
Wes Matthews and Robin Lopez is the best they can get.
"Beal, Rui, Kuzma, Bertans, Thomas Bryant/Robin Lopez, Aidja + flotsam. Is this a borderline playoff team?"
Robin and brook lopez: WWE tag team champions
Robin Lopez already has the Sideshow Bob comparison locked up.
There’s only one sideshow bob in the NBA and it’s Robin Lopez
Any halfway decent big could play well against him.  I’m pretty sure the same season that Robin Lopez killed him was the first season Brook Lopez was starting to shoot 3s because I have a strong memory of Brook stretching the floor and dropping them all over Dre.  Dude was a huge disappointment and thinks he’s better than he is.  After all the back injuries Dwight had to accept the player he was and became a useful player on a championship team.  Hopefully it doesn’t take Dre getting injured to realize he’s just a role player.
"Robin ""Batman"" and Brook ""Robin"" Lopez. Have you ever seen them in the same place at the same time?"
"Bro we were all saying that.  But still, why couldn’t he have even been a strong defensive presence?  That’s what always baffled me.  He had the potential for it.  But I don’t think he had the drive.    I remember years ago Robin Lopez dominated him.  That’s when I realized he’d never turn into the defensive monster I thought he was capable of."
Robin Lopez likes sitting on the floor when he's on the bench
Robin Lopez it is
We're trying to match Milwaukee's 2 Antetokounmpos and 1 Holiday with 1 Antetokounmpo and 2 Holidays. Then we just need to sign Robin Lopez.
"&gt;Swapping Simmons for Westbrook is probably a lateral move.   I used to think that but the more I delve into it, the fit becomes apparent.  Wizards' rotation of bigs (Robin Lopez, Gafford, and Alex Len) together were collectively the best in the league, outright dropping buckets at high efficiency. Russ really could get Embiid the ball and give him more space to operate than Simmons could. He was averaging close to 15 assists for the 2nd half of the year.  Russ is also from a cultural standpoint a great locker room and community presence - the opposite of Simmons, who likes to disappear and act aloof unless someone asked him if he should be RoY/DPOY. Russ goes hard in practice and would mesh well with Embiid who is self-accountable.   Simmons acting aloof and using his status as franchise player to avoid listening to coach Brown (who was begging him to shoot a bit more) really, really, rubbed me the wrong way."
"Literally never heard the phrase ""Quality over quantity"" eh?  So you should be fine with trading AD for 4 different players ranked somewhere between the top 40 and top 150, right? After all, that's a whole lot of assets to get in return for the best PF in the league, just like Scola/Martin/Odom/Dragic is a lot of assets to get in return for the best PG in the league.   Let's say Robin Lopez, Ingles, Bledsoe and SGA for AD, how could the Lakers possibly say no unless the league is rigged?!?"
He's basically Robin Lopez. Robin even had a lot of success this year playing with Russ.
I mean i wonder how many people said no. Get Robin Lopez on this team
"They had to trade Capela because he was injured he had a foot injury that would have kept him out all season and before the Capela trade Russ was dominating with Capela in the lineup so that ""he only played well because of small ball"" thing isnt true MDA and the coaching staff knew what they were doing hes best as a combo guard instead of a pg who facilitates the offense.  The team just prioritized spacing much more so with schemes, offensive plays, etc... the wizards dont. And ya a stretch 5 would be nice for russ but again if you have lineups like russ, ish smith, beal, hutchinson and robin lopez youre not going to have great spacing and the wizards ran these types of groups continuously nor are you doing russ any favors.  Every team has some sort of lineup with good spacing 4 out 1 in or 5 out where it works/utilized well. Suns did it , bucks, nets, lakers (even though it was a mess in the playoffs that was the goal 5 out with AD at the 5 till he got hurt), hawks with a lob threat, nuggets, etc...  &amp;#x200B;  My point is if russ is actually utilized well instead of terribly (OKC, Washington) he'll be a threat again."
Giannis isn’t half the player Robin Lopez is
"They gave away Robin Lopez going into AD's second season because they thought he'd eventually bulk up and play Center. It's also why they signed Ryan Anderson going into AD's rookie season, despite Anderson playing PF.  But yeah, AD's refusal to play consistent minutes at Center ended up being part of the problem.  But giving away Robin Lopez was an idiotic move too. He was on a very cheap contract and had a career year in his only season with New Orleans."
"ya good point I suppose its possible that I saw him and thought it was Robin Lopez, otherwise idk, Lopez is more of a spanish name too so its not like it was the name"
Tbh even having Robin Lopez on this team would have been a huge difference. What is Keldon Johnson doing on this roster?
"Rui Hachimura, Bertans, Robin Lopez, Gafford."
"A player with an unique skillset. LeBron, Steph, KD, Robin Lopez."
Nothing gets me as hyped as when robin lopez gets the ball in the post and you know he’s gonna drain the hook shot
"Robin Lopez, his boby hook"
"Daniel gafford, rui, sometimes robin lopez"
"This reminds me of the time I saw Brooke and Robin Lopez at Disneyland. It was night and the park was closing soon, my sister and I wanted to hit one last ride before heading out. Her and I walk up to the Matterhorn just to see insane lines of people thinking the same thing. This is when I notice Brooke and Robin standing with a small group of their own at front with a Disney cast member. The cast member opens a chain to let their party cut the line to get on and I grab my sister and kind of get close as if we were with them. The Disney person stops us and asked Brooke with we were with them and he pauses and then says “yeah”. My sister and I were in the same rig as the brothers and their knees came up higher than their heads it seemed haha I thanked them after and told them I was a fan. They were super nice."
"Could see him in Toronto, maybe Washington if Robin Lopez doesn't come back and Thomas Bryant isn't ready for start of the season. Dallas and Charlotte could use him as well."
"The Warriors fucked up last season, they really had a chance to the WCF or even the Finals if they had traded Wiseman and not traded for Oubre (just removing those 2 they would have been a playoff team without playing the Play In). The next year would be harder but the West is still relatively open.  Whatever they do, I think they need more dept and someone than when Steph is sit could provide scoring. If I was their GM I will target Melo as a FA with the minimum and Otto Porter for a mid level exception. Also Boogie Cousins could be helpful for the RS (not much in the PO) and he already knows the team and if I remember correctly he was friends with some of the guys there.  Other players they may target are: DRose as Steph backup, Robin Lopez and James Johnson (to add some big bodies too).  If they manage to add some of those guys they then just really need to turn Wiseman+Wiggins in something good, but I will also consider just packing Wiseman and one of the picks for useful guys (maybe Marcus Smart?), in the end they already had star power, and it's probably better to add good specialist."
"No, you're thinking of Robin Lopez."
Depends how deep on the bench but yeah I'm happy for Robin the Lopez brothers seem like good guys
wheres robin lopez
"No, you just have a bullshit definition of superteam. You're saying if a team drafts Kawhi, Steph, and Lebron it's not a superteam just because they drafted them? BULLSHIT.  &gt;A team formed overnight by free agency or players demanding trades.  Tell me how the Bucks got Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, and Robin Lopez. You know, their entire rotation."
We got CJ! Outside shooter who can create his own shot. But he’s 6’3 and bad at defense.  Best we can do is Robin Lopez for 2 years.  Blazers legend Pat Connaughton   Rockets legend RoCo is the best comparison I can do here.  This whole list is *pain*.
Robin Lopez
"The Antetokoumpo's win because they're 6'8, 6'10 and 6'11. Size matter too much in these kinds of things.    Last year when Robin Lopez was also on the Bucks reporters asked Giannis who would win in a 2v2, the Lopez twins or Thanasis and Giannis. It didn't take a second for Giannis to say Brook and Robin would win because they're just so huge"
"Hmm I heard Mike Trout is pretty good at sports, could he demand a trade from the Angels and create a super team with Robin Lopez?"
"Robin Lopez was really great at that for a few seasons, especially with the Knicks. Not sure about Brook"
The disrespect to Robin Lopez is real
i grew up watching him and Robin at Stanford with my dad. seriously feels like a lifetime ago. stoked for him. lopez bros are just hilarious too
"Poor Robin Lopez lol. It would've been cool if both brothers won a title together. Speaking of brothers, just realized that both Holiday brothers won a title too."
Robin Lopez gets the ring next hear with the Wiz
Robin Lopez needs a tv contract after retirement. He is genuinely hilarious.
"Get a backup PG, sign Tony Snell and Robin Lopez, bring back Bobby. Boom."
"You guys dont even like Russ lol. I really dont see the wizards game plan here. They have russ and beal plus a bunch of OK role players in rui, and gafford but the rest of the team is awful. They played guys like Raul Neto, Robin Lopez and Ish Smith who wouldnt even see floor time on a normal playoff team.   Theres no substance or end goal for the wizards besides a first round exit. And if a team is offering you kuz+THT and then for Beal picks with a young player along with the incentive to develop your young guys deni, rui, gafford, kuz, Bryant THT, your pick this year and next year you do it. Tell me please how thats a bad deal instead of settling for the 7th or 8th seed you are so gungho about?"
"I loved the dame, wes matthews, batum, lma, Robin lopez team they broke up too soon"
"Nope, Robin Lopez signed a 1+1 (player option for second year) deal, for about $5 million for each year (turned down the second year to go make more with Washington.)  Brook signed for the bi-annual exception the year before, which was actually even lower than I remembered - $3.5 million"
Robin Lopez is next.
Who's winning Finals MVP if the Bucks win? I think Robin Lopez has gotta be in the conversation
When I hear Lopez I instantly think of robin and his mascot fights   Miss seeing those fights hahaha
Guess Lopez will be the Robin tonight
Imagine being in the finals and getting dicked on by Bobby Portis and Robin lopez
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Thanasis Antetokounmpo 3. Kostas Antetkounmpo 4. Brook Lopez 5. Robin Lopez
"It was brutal. 4 of our starters were in a contract year and some bench players as well. In that year we became really good and all those guys earned major pay-checks.  Predictable the Bucks fucked it up and signed Bledsoe with the highest priority. They actually did it before the playoffs.  Honestly as much as I like Lopez, I wasn't sure about that contract. We could have signed Robin for 3 years on a super cheap deal instead of paying much more for Brook. Since he is not playing the most important minutes anyway it wouldn't have mattered as much.  That would potentially have allowed us to sign somebody else, but I don't remember what FA there could have been."
Robin Lopez is one of the most funny dudes period. This is up there with his “Not familiar with military artillery” answer to a tanking question.

"Pretty sure he means the detonation device but this would be hilarious.   &gt;Robin Lopez: *opens locker. “Why the fu—“  &gt;Jon Isaac: “I say young ker.

Friendship ended with jon isaac.      Now robin lopez is my best friend
Robin Lopez is a top 3 NBA troll
"This! He impacts the game in every way, not just scoring. He is obviously a scoring threat, but also a passing threat, and a rebounding threat. He knows we’re his teammates are and how they play and how to best use them. He made Daniel Gafford and Robin Lopez look really good by his incredible playmaking"
Robin Lopez looks like Sideshow Bob.
Respect Robin Lopez
"yeah we’re currently still missing Rui and Thomas Bryant. Pretty crazy how much depth we have this year, it was out of nowhere.   last year our bench was ish smith, garrison matthews, troy brown jr, bertans, and robin lopez"
"Could I, perhaps, interest you in 16 minutes of Alex Len, 16 minutes of Robin Lopez, and 16 minutes of Daniel Gafford?"
"I mean you also have to look at the fact that we have :  KCP, Kuzma, and Harrell replacing .... Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga/Chandler Hutchison, and Alex Len/Robin Lopez  And WUJ replacing Scott Brooks ..."
Personally I like Landale. I think he could fill a Robin Lopez like role of a backup big man who really rebounds. Id take him on the Bulls right now
Imagine if Drummond had a hook shot like Robin Lopez? He’d be a monster

"The way Wizards keep fighting back is amazing! -18, then -10 for the most of the game and they just keep grinding. Robin Lopez is very good with his hook and Rui has a great mid range. Also - shout out to Russ for doing his thing."
Damn so unlucky for the Hornets with those miss wide open 3pts shots.   The Wizards bench ball out.   Robin Lopez is the GOAT hook shot maker.

In todays league where every young player is focused on social media or gaming the game of basketball is almost detached from real life, from community. The only player in this league that really has the potential to remind us that in the end of the day basketball is a story about a group of strangers working together to achieve something truly great and pure is robin lopez."
Robin Lopez vs scrunchies
Robin Lopez
"You know who isn't though? Robin Lopez. That guy is always one step ahead out there, a true mount Rushmore type player."
Robin Lopez vs Peter Pan
"Nah fam, he's in North Hollywood on Radford ave by the in and out burger, and his name is Robin Lopez"

Hahahahahahaha ROBIN LOPEZ ofcourse lol
Robin Lopez vs Jordan
Can someone please explain the robin lopez thing I’ve never seen a thread this full of one joke
Luka has a ways to go before he’s on the same level as someone with a storied hall-of-fame career like Robin Lopez
Real tough choice but in the end I gotta go with Robin Lopez
"Even if he doesnt play at that high of a level I still think he will have better career than many. Having Jonas Valanciunas on steroids career is no shame it will pick you up some all star spots, one or two all nba teams(if some of the star centers have off year but i dont think he will be better than Embiid /Jokic). That will mean he would be top 5 center in era(if big boys keep ballin) of Jokic, Joel, Bam, Rudy, Vucevic(maybe exiting his prime) and Robin Lopez. Like in 80s and 90s you had Ewing, Hakeem, Admiral, Shaq and then you had Dikembe with 3 all nba teams, Zo with 2, Parish 2 and so on and Idk but I think all of them are hall of fame. Position is stacked"
"Robin Lopez has charisma, passes the eye test, and has skillset to dominate league for the next 20 30 years"
Robin Lopez
Robin “Right Eye” Lopez  Brook “Brown Eye” Lopez
Sources around the league are telling me it might be Robin Lopez.
"Robin fuckin Lopez, that guy is an absolute beast. Have you seen his baby boom shot?"
Robin Lopez? Idk
"If you're thinking about marketability, durability, sheer physical dominance, and a massive drive to be the best, the only player i've seen even flashes of those things is robin lopez.  he went up a level this year and keeps getting better."
Robin Lopez or Lobin Ropez
This is always a tough question. What is star power? Is it the ability to get calls to go your way more often than others? Is it becoming a house hold name? Is it being the face of the NBA? I think if you take all three into account then the obvious answer is Robin Lopez.
I think Robin Lopez is the most disrespected superstar in nba.
Robin Lopez. Can't see anyone but him.  Edited: lol why the downvote though. For speaking against the popular opinion? Smdh
"Idk why Noone saying Robin Lopez, but thread is fl of casuals anyway"
That guy who looks like Sideshow Bob from the Simpsons.   I think his name is Robin Lopez.
Robin 'MJ Wishes he was me' Lopez
Bulls legend Robin Lopez
"Anthony Edwards  Edit: sorry y’all, my phone got hacked. Personally, and I’m a bit biased, I’d have to say Robin Lopez."
That guy Robin Lopez hes a true star in the making
He’s no Robin Lopez
Robin lopez
"I forgot his name but that really awesome sky hook guy.  EDIT: just remembered, Robin Lopez  EDIT: spelling"
"I’m thinking there are a couple of players, the first that comes to mind is probably Robin Lopez"
Easily Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez looks like a guy that could murder someone on the court if you piss him off enough.
Lol relatively new NBA fan. Why all the Robin Lopez comments
I can GUARANTEE Robin Lopez would get there.
Between Luka or Zion I’m gonna pick Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez definitely comes to mind
u forgot to say robin lopez
Did everyone forget about Robin Lopez??
Robin Lopez obviously
"Eh, I hate following the trend but I can't really think of anyone as obvious as Robin Lopez."
"Robin Lopez, hands down"
"I don’t know what’s going on, but my money is on Robin Lopez"
And Robin Lopez is better than Luka
It’s Robin Lopez bro what more do you need
Context: Robin Lopez
"Robin Lopez, only to be outdone by his alter ego side show bob"
Robin Lopez....just cause
The great robin Lopez
I see no problem with this. Robin Lopez is one sexy mf. Bet he’s awesome in bed as well.
Gonna come across as a major homer here but probably Robin Lopez
"I actually think Lamelo could.  Edit: sorry, and Robin Lopez"
Good question. I asked Google Translate to translate “Chosen One” from English to Spanish and it said “Robin Lopez.”
"Thread is spot on, gotta be Robin lopez"
What is this Robin Lopez thing even coming from
"LeBron's my favorite player that's still in the league, but I honestly think Robin Lopez will be bigger than him."
"It's gonna be tough for anyone to reach his star power.. Especially obtaining that level of celebrity while maintaining the golden boy image. He's still raw and has a ways to go before reaching the height of his fame, but perhaps Robin Lopez."
Robin Lopez : Making the Skyhook great again
Ask Robin Lopez man idk
But Robin Lopez
Probably Robin Lopez
Def Robin Lopez
"Robin Lopez woulda locked him down, picked his ass up, and flung him into the stands. He’d have beat up the nuggets mascot for good measure too."
Robin Lopez wouldn’t fall on that shit
I’m surprised that nobody’s mentioned Robin Lopez yet
Robin Lopez burner?
"Fun fact, Lebron James has won fights against 0 mascots.  MJ won 0 fights against mascots.  Robin Lopez has won 17 fights against mascots, more than every other player in NBA history COMBINED.  Wilt, Jordan, Shaq, Kobe, Lebron, Magic, Bird &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Rolo."
"Definitely not Jalen, the guy would have to either be hugely popular pre-nba or be Robin Lopez"
Why do you think Robin Lopez couldn’t be the face of the league??
"Probably robin lopez, not positive tho"
Gotta be Lopez…Robin Lopez.
I think Robin Lopez
I don’t know if he’s been mentioned but former Suns draft pick Robin Lopez is someone to keep an eye on.
100% Robin Lopez
Toss up between robin lopez and brook Lopez. Gotta go with Robin though
Robin Lopez
"Gave it a lot of thought , in the end I have to go with Robin Lopez"
Hmmm.... tough one. Maybe Robin Lopez?
That’s when Robin Lopez took it personally
Has anybody considered Robin Lopez?
"easy, Robin Lopez"
Definitely Robin Lopez
It’s a toss up but I have to go with Robin Lopez here
You forgot about Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
Not the most popular opinion but I truly believe Robin Lopez could achieve it.
Robin lopez
Robin Lopez  But internationally Curry is pretty damn close
What about Robin Lopez?
Robin lopez
Robin Lopez
"At that level? As in, even above Shaq and Kobe? Other than Robin Lopez, probably nobody. Luka doesn’t have quite the excitement factor. That’s not even a personal belief; I’m looking at popular perception. LeBron and MJ - those guys were/are major athletic highlight machines and were basically instant household names.   Larry Bird is a major exception but he also had Magic to work off of, and vice versa, and both combined to explode the NBA in popularity. Luka doesn’t have a Magic equivalent yet, and he also isn’t in a position where he has to resurrect a dying sport."
Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez
Gotta be Robin Lopez
Gotta be Robin Lopez
Robin Lopez

Robin Lopez looks like he’s on coke 24/7
The Miami Heat need Bam to stretch the floor by making mid-range jumpers because they're fucked in the paint with Robin Lopez sitting under the basket all game.
Wow Bam Adebayo has looked like absolute garbage the past 2 games. I know Robin Lopez is a hard match up for him since he cant bully his way to the basket but man he looks like he's checked out mentally.
Is he even better than Robin Lopez?
This is Robin Lopez slander
Robin Lopez begs to differ!
What about starting freakin Robin Lopez!
Is this the first time Robin Lopez has ever been compared to Tom Brady? Lmfao
"oh wow Embiid could overcome Alex Len and Robin Lopez, guess he is better than Kareem now"
"the Robin Lopez isos can be ugly but with a Scott Brooks' half court offense generally speaking it's been the best play for weeks now lol  &gt; Among NBA players with at least 100 post-ups this season, Lopez has been the most efficient, according to Synergy Sports. More than Vucevic. More than Joel Embiid. More than Nikola Jokic. Entering play Sunday, the Wizards were scoring 122.9 points per 100 possessions on plays that end in his shots, turnovers or passes out of the post, putting him well atop the league.  ^^ From 4/26 Athletic [article](https://theathletic.com/2542845/2021/04/26/the-hookman-mild-mannered-robin-lopez-has-become-a-wizards-low-post-superhero/)"
I can't help but love Robin Lopez man
"Robin Lopez is the hook shot god, wtf are you talking about? He hit them all, even the ones after the shot clock violation."
"Couple Notes I took from this game:   * They keep running isos for Westbrook and Beal, but not getting a mismatch beforehand. It's frustrating to watch Beal trying to force through Thybulle or Simmons instead of Curry.   * Robin Lopez isos are really ugly and I cannot believe they're happening. How is Gafford not playing more minutes?   This game was close but I don't think the Wizards will be able to compete with Sixers shooting with the way their defense is playing."
just turned on the game and watched robin lopez with 3 post catches in the last 2 minutes. What kind of alternate universe is this
Robin Lopez is shooting 65% on 120 attemps with hook shots this year. Let that sink in
"Sorry if this is a bad take because I don't watch every game, but how the fuck is Robin Lopez still in the league"
"Robin ""Kareem Abdul Jabbar lite"" Lopez"
"I almost forgot that the suns once had Shaq, Grant Hill, and Robin Lopez on the same team lol"
Robin olajuwon Lopez
Does Robin Lopez ever miss hook shots
Why is Robin Lopez posting up Embiid with five seconds on the clock lol
Gotta love blazers legend Robin Lopez
Bruh Robin Lopez really this nice? Mfs spoke on him like he was wash
"Robin ""the real Kareem"" Lopez"
Robin Lopez is like Hakeem but white and with better hair
robin lopez looks like that clown from the Simpsons
Bulls legend Robin Lopez
Don’t forget robin lopez
"The Wizards are oddly well equipped to line up a Shaq like foul rotation among their centers.   * Robin Lopez: 3 fouls, 3 minutes * Alex Len: 2 fouls, 7 minutes * Daniel Gafford: 2 fouls, 4 minutes"
I never will understand going to Robin Lopez in the post against Embiid while you have Russ and Beal on the floor
"robin lopez, alex len and dan gafford... all guys on 2k that i fill my roster with.   eeek"
Len thinks he’s robin lopez
Wdym they have basketball jesus himself. Robin “Sky Hook” Lopez
Robin Lopez bout to have a field day
Robin Lopez best center in the league
I like Gafford a ton for your future and fully expect Brooks to play Robin Lopez as much as possible instead today.
