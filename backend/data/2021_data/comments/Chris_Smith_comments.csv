"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"""Former Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul was on the Knuckleheads podcast with Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson and explained the impact of the Rockets losing Ariza.      “People don’t realize, that’s the biggest thing that we missed. That was tough when we lost [Ariza] because he sorta was like the glue. He was that glue for our team.”""  Cohesion matters, glue guys matters. They change the work culture, keep things in order. He was the defensive leader on that team. Those don't make headlines, tehres a reason miami pays haslem to just be the culture.  Despite what espn teaches, basketball is not won 1-1.  Go back and look at any rings. Old 'ass' Kerr, PAxon, Horry, Fisher, Kenny smith, Marc Gasol, etc have made vital plays to win rings.    They aren't going to get headlines, but it matters."
"End point is absolutely true, but Jokic is basically the most extreme example of an elite player being passed over in NBA draft history.  You've got Warriors flair so you should probably remember that there was a lot of presumption that Fuller was a bad pick. Yet another stubborn insistence on drafting presumed best big man available.   Before Fuller at #11, the Warriors had picked:  * Tyrone Hill at #11. * Chris Gatling at #16 and Victor Alexander at #17.  * Cliff Rozier at #16.  And even Joe Smith at #1 was a bad use of the #1.   And it didn't stop with Fuller, because then there was..  * Adonal Foyle at #8. * Antawn Jamison at #4 (in exchange for Vince Carter at #5). * Andris Biedrins at #11. * Ike Diogu at #9. * Patrick O'Bryant at #9. * Anthony Randolph at #14. * Ekpe Udoh at #6.  Shit, going further back in history, the Warriors and drafting big men is just fraught with lulz:  * Chris Washburn at #3 in 1986. * Russell Cross at #6 in 1983.  The one time in the past 50 years that they actually drafted the best true big available was way back in 1976. And then they quickly fucked that up in spectacular fashion, trading Chief *and the pick that became Kevin McHale*...for Joe Barry Carroll.  Expand definition of ""drafted"" and ""true big"" so that we include them getting Chris Webber...and we know how that went.  And now we have this whole anxiety over James Wiseman. I'm not worried. I think Wiseman will pan out to be a star.  But keep in mind that I tried to be optimistic about Todd Fuller, too."
"A lot of guys passed on Kobe, he wasn't considered a lock at all.  We drafted bad back then, but we weren't the worst.  Unfortunately, our 2 top picks ended up being busts.  Joe Smith (who was a consensus #1) was a bust (for a top pick) and Chris Webber screwed us over."
"Chris Paul is a great example of a winner who has just been unlucky throughout his career. It's not his fault Josh Smith happened to go nuclear against the Clips, and it's not entirely his fault the Rockets missed 27 3pointers in a row. He still makes every team he's on significantly better.  His NFL counterpart may be someone like Jim Kelly"
"They never made it past the first round, but the post-Melo Nuggets were like 10 deep and made the playoffs three years in a row. Their second unit was nearly as good as their starting lineup.  2010-11 (post trade deadline): Nene, Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen, Al Harrington, JR Smith, Ty Lawson, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Kenyon Martin, Arron Afflalo  2011-12: Nene, Birdman, Lawson, Gallinari, Afflalo, Brewer, Harrington, Kenneth Faried, Andre Miller, Javale McGee, Corey Brewer, Kostas Koufos, Mozgov(?), Rudy Fernandez (season ending injury), Wilson Chandler (played in China during lockout, returned and got season ending injury)"
"Imo, Carmelo isn’t championship caliber player. I’m a Denver native, my dad was a season ticket holder Melos whole career with the nuggets. I saw him play really close for many years. Saw him many times with everyone. Including Iverson. Melo as a player just seemed kinda immature. He really liked to do flashy stuff but wasn’t much of a team player. Moreso, he was just not that good. His athleticism wasn’t as great as Iverson, JR smith, Earl Boykins, and Chris Anderson. I remember those 4 guys really lit it up some games. Melo was never like that. I think he eventually matured after he was traded but by the time he did, he was out of his athletic peak."

Oh for sure. I wasn’t trying to make a claim for Smith as the all-time Clipper. Was mostly just trying to fill folks in on who he was. I do think he’s underrated but I do not believe he had the impact on the franchise and sustained individual stardom of Chris Paul or even Blake Griffin.
"Randy Smith?? If it’s not chris Paul, then bob macadoo is definitely the clippers goat. He won the franchise’s one and only mvp"
"Randy smith had to get replaced.... were not gonna say Blake was more important to turning that franchise around? They were literally the worst team in the league for years and had a toxic losing culture, then they draft Blake, wait a year for him to get healthy, sign Chris Paul, and they both turn the entire direction of the franchise around. Prime lob city Blake was a top 5-10 player in the league and he definitely should at least be an honorable mention when it comes to al time clippers"
"2015 I feel like they would've won the title if Josh Smith doesn't go crazy in Game 6. Warriors still had a lot of trouble dealing with size, and Chris Paul was just playing on another level."
Chris Smith was pretty good at a major university in the best conference the seasons he was there
"Valid, but Chris Smith wasn't that much better and at the very least, Blevins is related to one of the best players in Blazers history and is on a two-way contract. Meanwhile, Chris Smith got a full NBA contact just because he was the brother of fucking JR Smith"

Chris Smith.  Literally only got a chance with the Knicks because of JR.
"There's a couple things here.  The first is that he isn't like old Dwight Howard where he demands the ball more and asks for a coach who recognizes his weakness to get fired.   He knows he's not great offensively and essentially feasts on scraps at that end of the floor (offensive rebounds and guys dumping the ball into his hands when the defense breaks down).   As to getting rebounds; he does that. More than anybody in the league over the last nine years. Since his rookie season, nobody has grabbed more rebounds than him in that time when you combine those nine seasons.   His screen setting could be better, but it's his offensive ineptitude that makes it harder. If he steps out to set a screen, his defender can stay back or step out to get ahead of the switch. There's no need to worry about him.  As to catching lobs, that has been an issue in part because he'd never played with a great point guard. Had he been a rookie with a guy like Chris Paul or LeBron, he'd be more adept at that sort of thing, but he played in a system that relied on a heavy dose of post play from Greg Monroe early (which didn't work for Monroe because Drummond's defender was always close at hand for a double team) or with Jennings and Smith, neither of whom were very interested in passing the ball.   &amp;#x200B;  People point out Drummond's offensive ineptitude, but it's like beating a dead horse.  He knows his limits, he doesn't force it, and he grabs almost as many offensive rebounds as he has missed FGs, so, statistically, his offensive game is actually pretty productive.   The issue is that his defender can lean off him and double his teammates easier, which makes things harder for his teammates on offence."

"I don't think you can be in the league with low BBIQ. I think the biggest flaw is how you play your position. Chuck mentioned in recent TNT post game show that players are getting away from the fundamentals (which is hard to believe because of how skill is cultivated now) and just focusing on getting the 3.  Coaches run drills in practices and skirmishes to ensure players at least if they aren't thinking about the play to be conditioned enough to subconsciously be productive. An example of this would be in Semi-pro the movie, Woody Harroldsons' character has them run that play so they would be performing it without being cognisant.  I can see a hierarchy of of BBIQ within the players like from S class players like Chris Paul, Rondo, LeBron, Luka to more sub Par players like JR Smith."
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
"As a Suns fan who is loving having Chris Paul on his team, I would say that the Suns record from the 2019-2020 season is worse than that team actually was. Injuries/suspensions to Ayton, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio, Booker and others forced Monty to play absolutely terrible bench lineups. I can still vividly remember the 3 pg lineups of: Elie Okobo, Ty Jerome, Jevon Carter, Oubre and Frank. This led to the Suns being worse than the actually were. You may wonder why the Suns played so well in the bubble, well besides major growth from M. Bridges and C. Johnson and the addition of Cam Payne, finally having a completely healthy roster (with the exception of Oubre) allowed this team to play up to its potential.   Also, James Jones had a great offseason - getting rid of Oubre, Okobo, Baynes, and Jerome while adding Crowder, Galloway, Moore, and Nader. Then he added Craig midseason this year and he's been great. The Suns still remain weak in their big man depth (an injury to Ayton or Saric is my number one fear as a Suns fan right now). But the improved depth of this team is tremendous. Everyone on the team belongs on an NBA roster (well, Jalen Smith is TBD there) which is something you couldn't say about most Suns players for the past 5 years.   Point being, while the Chris Paul addition has been big, I think that health and improved depth have been just as consequential, if not more so. In the case of the Suns, it is a massive over simplification to attribute all their improvement to CP3, and it takes away from the work our GM, coaching staff, trainers, and players have put in. I will grant the argument though that without the CP3 trade we don't get Nader, nor do we attract Crowder, Moore, or Galloway.  TLDR: due to multiple injuries at key positions the Suns record last season was worse than the team actually was; thus, using the change in the Suns record from last season to this season as a means for quantifying the impact of Chris Paul on the suns does not paint a completely accurate picture. Improved health and roster depth for the Suns have been just as consequential, if not more so, than the addition of CP3. Without CP3 there is no way this Suns team is a #2 seed in the west, but I believe they'd be sitting in the #5/#6 range if they still had Rubio instead of Paul.   Thank you for reading this rant."
I’m 21 and also lebron had Dwade and Chris Bosh two of the top 15 players in the league at the time all stars Carmelo took a team with jr smith as his second best player his 6th man
"The team was 20-15 before he got injured they were definitely on the way to the playoffs on pace for 47 wins.  then they changed coaches and Odom missed 17 games and kobe missed 16 games   For 17 games they started Smith Parker, kobe, demean George, Kwame and Chris Mihn.   If the team was healthy and I mean kobe and Odom they were on the way to the playoffs"
Chris Smith lmfaoo
Steve Kerr used to be a great TV analyst.   Chris Webber is also a lot better in studio than he is as a color commentator.   Kenny Smith is pretty good
"Well... a lot of great players don't have rings. Barkely. Stockon. K. Malone. George Gervin. Elgin Baylor. Nique. Reggie Lewis. Chris Paul. Mutumbo.   And some truly great players only have one: Garnett, Dirk, Paul Pierce.   A player's greatness isn't about how many rings they got; it's about what they do on the court.   It's guys like Stephen A. Smith that drive players to chase rings.    And then those same guys complain when players move around to win a title.   &amp;#x200B;  That said, I don't think teams could build a champion around Westbrook or Carmelo.  The guy you build your team around has to have a core drive that's going to put their team in a position to win.   &amp;#x200B;  Melo's core drive was scoring. He's said it before. If his team won and he didn't score 30, he felt like he wasn't doing his job.   Westbrook's drive is filling the box scores.   But as a team, the core drive needs to be something outside of personal stats.   &amp;#x200B;  Jordan's core drive was to score and defend and fill the stat sheet, but he changed it to winning. It wasn't enough to win the match up and be the best player on the court. He needed to be on the best team. His drive changed. People might piss on the or down vote it, but I watched Jordan before he won a title and he was a different player before Phil Jackson. That first year with Phil, Jordan changed his game. It wasn't enough that year because they needed to fill the roster first, but there was a change.   Other guys, like LeBron: his core drive is to lead and win. He puts guys on the court and moves them around and calls out defensive assignments and switches. But it's all toward the ring, not the personal stats.   Curry's drive is to get the best shot for the team. He shares the ball even though he's the best shooter in the history of the game.   Teams gotta build around a guy whose core drive is the team, not personal stats.   Do Westbrook and Melo want to win. Of course. But they also want to get their stats.   Melo has humbled himself now, and doing well by it, but the Blazers aren't built around him: They are built around Dame.   &amp;#x200B;  So if you get guys like Melo, or Westbrook, or McGrady, or Nique, as AMAZING as all of them are (First ballot HOF), then have a certain drive that is more individual than collective. You can build a champion around that."

PG: Chris Paul  SG: JR Smith  SF: Zion Williamson  PF: David West  C: Anthony Davis  I had to do a little positional flexibility
"Chuck had a good supporting cast with 7 guys averaging in double figures (KJ, Thunder Dan, Cedric Ceballos, Tom Chambers and Danny Ainge where all all stars at points in their careers... That's 6 out of the top 7 who became all star players vs our 2 in Book and Chris Paul) ...   Kevin Johnson is arguably a better passer than Chris Paul and had an awesome career, Dan Majerle was a great defender (2nd team all defense in 93) but was our best shooter at a high clip at that time (38% on 5.3 attempts); Cedric Ceballos (future all star) had an even higher fg% than Charles at 57.6% that lead the entire league at that time, and he's a small forward, Danny Ainge was still serviceable (played 80 games and hit 40% of his 3s at 4.7 attempts per game) and also averaged double figures; Richard Dumas had a remarkable year as well with 15.8ppg, wc is more than Ayton or Bridges' averages per game, and don't forget about Tom Chambers who was at a decline bit still averaged 12.2 ppg and shooting 39% from 3 while playing 73 games. Mark west and Oliver Miller aren't of the same caliber as Ayton, or even Saric/Kaminsky, but held the middle nicely and passed the ball really well for bigs then, especially Oliver Miller...  I'd argue the 92-93 suns may have the better talent up top, but our 2020-21 suns are better up to the 13th man (still not sold on Jalen Smith tbh).  If you saw that Suns team, they were a joy to watch and also had a strong will to win despite the odds... Chuck was a 6'4""-6'5"" PF for crying out loud, lol... But he dominated on offense and rebounded better than anybody despite his height... That's why they got to the Finals and almost pulled off the championship despite losing the first 2 games at Home... I believed they were a better team than the Bulls, but the Bulls just had the greatest player in the league at that time... Good times :-)  GO SUNS!!!"

"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
We'll give you Chris Boucher and a ham sandwich for Jalen Smith
Who do yall think the Mavs should trade for then immediately release Dorian-Finney-Smith?  * Marvin Bagley * Goran Dragic * Chris Boucher * Bradley Beal * Other
"LOL  then please, go tell that same thing, to NBA Today's Steve Smith or Chris Broussard or Nick Wright or Tim Legler... because we woke this morning, to find that they all agree with what I said here last night.  *Look at the play without your,* ***emotions****, then you will see it for what it is.*  Beef Stew face was much lower to the ground due to him extending his body to shove Lebron as far away as he could. Which means that when Lebron was looking at the basket while swunging, waist level, to free himself from Beef Stew or counter Beef Stew's shove...then he actually hit Beef Stew in the face. Agmain, because of how Beef Stew's face was much lower to the ground due to his body extending outward farther than usual human motion."

"Curry missed a jump shot at 4:40 left that also would have tied it. Almost air balled it. That would have tied it at 86. Why isn't that a turning point?  The reason Embiid called the non-dunk a turning point is because of mentality. He's thinking that Simmons wasn't in the right mindset, and said so. That mindset is the only reason this particular moment could be considered a turning point.  It wasn't a pivotal foul when down one with less than a minute to go, that lead to a three free throws. It wasn't a pivotal turnover with 40 seconds to go that lead to a dunk the other way. It was a mental decision with three and a half minutes to go. He called Ben Simmons mentality out, publicly.  People remember shots that go in, we forget about the shots that missed. But, we one hundred percent remember bad decisions. Chris Webber and the time out, we're still talking about it. JR Smith and that rebound. And now Ben Simmons and the dunk.  It was a turning point and Embiid called him out. You can say, fair enough, that was the truth. What you can't say is that is a good team mate, or that is a team leader.  As a comparison, look at what happened when the Spurs lost to the eventual champion Mavs in 2006:  &gt; Ginobili placed the burden of the loss squarely on his shoulders that summer, feeling he'd cost his teammates - specifically Michael Finley and Fabricio Oberto, who joined the team because of his relationship with Ginobili - a shot at becoming NBA champions.  &gt; ""I don't say this lightly, but we all told each other: We have to stick with Manu,"" Sean Marks, current Brooklyn Nets general manager and former Spurs reserve, told ESPN's Zach Lowe. ""We had to talk him off the ledge. We had everyone calling, texting, trying to hang out with him.""  Nobody even blamed Manu, but he still felt the weight of the world. Imagine if Tim Duncan rocked up and said that foul on Dirk was the turning point?! Of course, it probably was, it doesn't need to be said. The job is hard enough without your team mates calling you the fuck out!"
"Speaking of missing on draft picks, you guys want Chris Boucher for Jalen Smith?"
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."

"He's just a really cool player man, no one has ever claimed he is as good as ""kyrie irving, chris paul, or even derrick rose.""    Also you have zero obligation to be a fan of his.  If you aren't, then you aren't.  I think he has some of the sickest highlights in the NBA and seems like a cool dude, and obviously he plays for my fav team (and is my favorite player) so I'm a massive fan.  I've also always been a sucker for players with a high ""highlight-to-production"" ratio.  Dudes like JR Smith who might not score 30 every night but still is obviously an insanely talented player with insane highlights and capable of popping off any night.  Difference between JR and Jamal is that both are that, but Jamal clearly has a bit more of a ""killer instinct,"" leadership and focus on the game.   But if you watch his highlights and his bubble performance and that's not enough to make you a fan, then it's fine just not being a fan.  This is an odd post"
"I'm not saying that his MVP was threatened. The voters had it right for the most part though bafflingly enough he only received 90/101 1st place votes.   But this isn't fake adversity. I'm talking about the fan and media perception of Jokic. The Jump had days of segments dedicated to trying to make the MVP vote more competitive than it was going to be. Rachel Nichols and Windhorst were finding every way not to say Jokic was deserving. This was while the Nuggets had a great record and an incredible run even when Murray went down thanks to Jokic. That didn't matter enough either.  Hell, Windhorst famously went on Bontemps podcast (the guy who does the poll of the MVP voters all season) and got eviscerated by Tim and the other guest for basically saying it was ridiculous to give Jokic the MVP. This is despite the numbers (or bball ref mvp tracker) having him as the leader before LeBron or Embiid even went down to injury.   Of 16 ESPN people polled this year nobody took Jokic as the MVP winner, but had Jimmy Butler and Anthony Davis as picks. Stephen A. Smith didn't have him in his top 8 in the preseason predictions. ESPN has Doncic ahead of him despite being inferior in every possible way because ""Jokic isn't a two way player"", despite not only the numbers proving otherwise but the fact that Doncic is a much worse defender. Preseasons sports books had him with the 12th best odds to win MVP behind people like Tatum, Kawhi, Durant AND Harden, by large margins.  The is the only year that a reigning MVP doesn't get a game on Christmas since they went to the 5 game format in 08, to the dismay of Nuggets players who took to twitter about it.   Nick Wright infamously said ""The Nuggets are a pretend contender with a pretend superstar"" and pretty much sticks to that take, openly mocking Jokic whenever he can in almost a Bayless-like manner. Lets not forget less than 6 months ago he was the one who started the narrative that, ""Historically speaking, he would be the worst [MVP] we've had in 35 years.""  Which is obviously complete insanity.  The only people in the media who are out there championing how good Jokic is are Jalen Rose and and Bomani Jones. Yet so many others are years late to the party and are still stuck on viewing him like some sort of silly outlier who can't play defense.  This isn't just some weirdo homer take either, feel free to google who the most disrespected player in the NBA is and you just end up with a litany of Jokic discussions.   So this certainly isn't fake adversity. Anyone who knows basketball knows Jokic is one of the 3 best players in the league right now, and was last season, but do you honestly think that if LeBron or Embiid didn't get hurt that the MVP would have been given to Jokic? Keep in mind that the numbers and ref tracker were heavily favoring Jokic before anyone had any type of injury.   The answer is no, and why? Because the media has a humongous influence on everyone including many of the voters. That's how Steph Curry and Chris Paul end up with 7 combined 1st place votes last year, despite not even being a consideration until the very last moment when some outlets were scrambling for whatever reason they could find to not give Jokic the award, or to drum up some sort of controversy so the discussion didn't become stale for the last month of play.    He's a big, slow, quiet, uninterested in awards or fanfare or popularity, noncontroversial, emotionally reserved white dude playing in a small market where the fans can't even watch his games locally because of a TV contract dispute. He will never have the look, or the narrative, or the style that is conducive to generating interest from casual fans; and he has absolutely zero interest or concern with that, doesn't care about the MVP, just wants to win games. So he isn't out there championing for himself either and would rather people on the team didn't as well.  Genuinely if you think this is fake adversity, or that Jokic isn't treated significantly different than every other supermegastar MVP in league history, then you are either not paying attention to the league/Jokic enough, or you are being needlessly defensive for whatever reason.   Everyone knows there is a bizarre imbalance in the treatment and appreciation of Jokic with fans and the media. One that is outrageously contrasted to the way his peers see him, as his teammates say that they've never seen anything quite like it, the people he plays against like Draymond and Ayton give uniquely high praise to him, and if another more marketable player had the numbers that Jokic did (or if Jokic were in a large market) people would be clamoring to call last season one of the 5 greatest offensive seasons ever, and he's on his way to another one."

"Chris Boucher?   He averaged 14/7 with 2 blocks last year, shooting 38% on 3 Pt attempts a year last year.   Not sure how you think Jalen Smith is close to being able to do that.

"Ray Allen with the heat, J.R. smith with the cavs, DLo with the Nets, Chris Paul Houston, PG13 OKC, Danny Green Raptors. Can you tell I’m young?"
"You’re literally throwing all context out the window and cherry picking every bad shooting perfomance to act like that’s all he did. With people like you, you’re not arguing in good faith so you’ll never see the other side of the spectrum  Regardless, did he play bad in the 2012 finals? Yes, but he was also huge in every other series and was a huge reason they even beat the Spurs to make the finals  In 2013 we were the 8th seed.  Lmao in that 2015 series Corey Brewer and Josh smith averaged a 44% and 45% TS respectively. They both played like shit and were net negatives, the least they can do is hit some fucking threes for harden lol. I’m not sure how hardens entire series is discounted because of that, he averaged 25 and 8 on 60% TS and was huge in game 7, but of course you ignore that  https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-western-conference-semifinals-clippers-vs-rockets.html  The warriors series was over after we went down 2-0 and nobody could provide harden with any help. It’s funny how you never acknowledge team contexts, whether it be help harden has or the strength of the opponent. I’m sure if it was your favorite player you’d be finding reasoning  too, but since it’s harden and you have this weird hate boner for him  Harden is stubborn as fuck when it comes to injuries so it’s not surprising be played through a concussion   https://bbs.clutchfans.net/threads/spurs-g5-6-finally-solved-was-harden-playing-through-a-concussion.286895/  Going to a night club doesn’t mean shit. There’s a difference between just being somewhere and playing playoff basketball lol  You put blame on him for blowing those games 6 and 7 leads but you won’t actually give him any credit for getting those leads in the *first place* considering he’s 1 lone guy going against the most unfair team of all time, who, by the way, we’re losing to him until Chris Paul went down. And needed refs to still beat him  Why would I care about a poor shooting game 7 when he contributed in other ways and was overall still great in the series even though he was guarded by one of the best defenders in the league? And his supermax teammate couldn’t even play?  Our losses to the lakers were by a large amount of points so by the time the 4th quarter comes the game is already out of reach. You’re acting as if these were some down to the wire games where harden dissapeared, no, he put up 30 and 8 on 65% TS playing 4 on 5 basketball. Westbrook sucked dick.  2021 he dominated the celtics I don’t give a fuck how ass you think they are he put up 29/8/10 on 76% TS nobody just does that.   Shit ass argument foh"
"What about JR Smith? Game 1 of the 2018 finals?  Edit: Deandre Jordan had a similar incident against the Blazers. He rebounded the ball as the shot clock went off, which he took for the game clock. So he just held the ball as time expired and Chris Paul furiously screamed at him to shoot it lol"
"Kobe scored on below league average efficiency in every single series in 2002 except the Finals where the Lakers just collectively rolled over the Nets.  His playmaking was also overrated: 4.6 apg and 2.8 TO is not bad for a Playoff run especially in the early 00's, but also not anything to write home about. The Lakers played primarily through Shaq, using his inside gravity to create space outside the paint. They didn't use Kobe as a primary facilitator, he just attacked the space and shot, while occasionally passing. The rest did the same, that's why the most important Laker players at the time all had similar AST/TO numbers and low volume assist totals.  I'm looking at efficiency relative to the league average at that time... And Kobe shot worse than league average and worse than he did during the RS in the 2002 Playoffs...   Gasol/Odom/Ariza or MWP + whenever Bynum player was easily the best frontcourt in the league at the time, and one of the best frontcourts from 2000 to 2010... Fisher was worse than early 00s but it didn't matter, he still could do most of what he always did, shoot threes and defend. And it's not like the early 00s Lakers had some godlike guard depth either.  Gasol's postseason run from 2008-2010 was immaculate. Dude only had like 2 bad series and both came first half-year he was there against the Spurs and Celtics defense, two of the best teams in the league at the time outside LA. Even then, Gasol played better than Kobe in the 2008 Finals...   Young Melo was overrated. Couldn't do shit before and after Chauncey during that era... If he was one of the best players in the league at that time, he would be able to have more PS success with those Nuggets teams... He had AI/Chauncey, JR Smith, Camby, Nene, Kenyon Martin, Birdman, Afflalo, Ty Lawson, Kleiza at various points from 2007-2010... Melo was a great scorer but absolutely terrible defensively and weak playmaker as well... Isolation merchant. Man was equivalent to modern day Zach LaVine, but a worse playmaker and playing a more important position defensively...  Spurs were clearly in limbo after Duncan's prime. They needed some time to adjust and refresh the team. They were still a good team in 2008, but Chris Paul almost took them out by himself... 2005-2007 and 2012-2016 Spurs were the peak Spurs under Pop era... Kobe managed to get Pau during the right timeframe in between which allowed him to capitalize on Spurs down years.  Not really. I just think Pau from '08-'10 was more consist than Kobe during '00-'02...   If i had to rank their level of impact during these runs it would be:  01 Kobe 10 Pau 09 Pau  02 Kobe/08 Pau 00 Kobe  Like i said. Pau was more consistent. You knew kind of what to expect from him. Kobe's impact was moreso rooted in his ability to get hot from the floor... In 2001 he found his zone and dominated, every other surrounding year he was a dice roll to an extent."

"* The 2016 Warriors were in the Finals to begin with because the Thunder blew their own 3-1 lead.  * The 60 win Bullets got **swept** in the Finals by the 48 win Warriors who literally didn't even have their homecourt available to start the series due to a scheduling conflict.  There have only been 9 sweeps in Finals history.  * Dirk lost to the 8 seed Warriors in the first round his MVP season.  * The Wilt/West/Baylor Lakers lost Game 7 of the Finals in 1969 at home to the Celtics in Bill Russell's final season after hanging up balloons in the rafters, having a celebration cake, and having 5 unopened bottles of champagne already set up in the locker room waiting for them before the game started.  * This isn't even the worst choke of Chris Paul's career considering that your Clippers blew a 3-1 lead to Josh fucking Smith.

"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"

"Kevin Garnett is the man who got the high-school-to-NBA-pipeline going in the modern era.   Before him, no matter how great you were, it was understood that you'd be going to college for at least two years to develop under the tutelage of college coaches.   Chris Webber, for instance, was a monster before he ever stepped foot on campus in Ann Arbor but there was never once a consideration that he'd just bypass college altogether. Instead, he put in two years with the University of Michigan and made waves by declaring after just his sophomore year - the first player to go No. 1 as a sophomore since Magic Johnson in 1979.   Kevin Garnett *was* ahead of his class, but so were others who'd come before him. He was just the first in a long time to decide to go against the grain and declare, despite what everyone said about his need to develop, how he might not be ready for the NBA game, that he might stunt his growth at the end of an NBA bench instead of starring and growing at university.   After KG showed it was possible, Kobe came next and proved it was just as possible for a guard to pull off the same trick. Then the floodgates opened. Tracy McGrady, Korleone Young, Jermaine O'Neal, Leon Smith, right on up until Amir Johnson around 2005 or so."
My offseason shitposting dream is that the Chris Paul turning into a basketball commercial/analysis becomes the Josh Smith eating breakfast of this generation of nephews
"&gt;Nobody said Malone wasn’t the driving force.  Actually everyone in the 90s said that and if you go back and watch full games and look at the stats, Malone was clearly the best player on the team. And look into the 1998 season if you don't believe me.  &gt; A good bit but it is very unlikely every single one went to Karl Malone.  Most did.  &gt;Karl Malone doesn’t have anything to do with the steal numbers either, that’s all personal effort on defense.  Oh yeah Stockton was a solid defender, CP3 is clearly he better one.  &gt;And Chris Paul lost in the playoffs literally every year as well, and has always been known for choking/blowing series leads/being injured  CP3 has choked like once or twice in his career. Overall, his stats go up in the playoffs while Stockton's go down. And Stockton has choked many times.  &gt;so that argument makes no sense.  Wtf are you talking about? I countered your point about Mj being the reason Stockton couldn't win.   &gt;Even in this playoffs the suns have a better offensive net rating with Chris Paul off the floor.   CP3 was injured in the first round and had Covid in the 3rd.  &gt;And I’m pretty sure John was the one that put the jazz up a point in game six of the 98 finals with some seconds left. Before JORDAN hit the shot to win it.  1 shots doesn't excuse Stockton from averaging less than 10 fucking points that series and having a 2 point game. He played garbage that series.  &gt;So yes, if there wasn’t a Michael Jordan in the world, the jazz would probably be 2 time champions in the league and John Stockton would have 2 rings.  We can play the ""what if"" game for every player of all time. And your what if  is the stupidest one ever. You can't just make a what if about someone not existing. A better one would be ""What if CP3 doesn't get injured against the warriors"" or ""what if Josh Smith become Michael Jordan against the clippers"" or ""What if David Stern doesn't veto the CP3 trade"".  &gt; I stand by my argument, if cp3 wins the chip we can talk, but if not John Stockton had the better career  Nope CP3 has had a better career even if he doesn't get the ring. He has better accomplishments, better advanced stats, much better peak, less help, played in a tougher conference, and was always the best player on his team(outside of the 2 years with the rockets)."
Micheal Wilson and Stephen A Smith trying to out suck the cock of Chris Paul. The had to one up each other with their stories of him and promote their projects. Awesome commentation
"Would love to see Chris Paul v the Hawks just to remind all Hawks fans of the pain of a front office drafting Marvin Williams over him when they already had Al Harrington and Josh Smith, but wanted to ride with their PG... Now Coach Tyronn Lue"
"For comparison, here's the list of key players who missed  games in the 2015 playoffs due to injury. (I chose this year at random, but it may have been an outlier as well)  *Stars/Borderline Stars*  * John Wall * Pau Gasol * Kevin Love * Kyrie Irving * Rojon Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul * Mike Conley  *Key Role Players:*  * Andrew Bogut * Tony Allen * Kyle Korver * JR Smith"
JR Smith had his brother on the Knicks. Chris Smith used to be a meme on here in the old days.
"There’s so many bad ones out there it’s hard to pick just one. Chris Broussard, Skip Bayless, Shannon Sharpe, Colin Cowherd, Nick Wright, Kendrick Perkins, and Jay Williams all come to mind when bringing up the worst ones. Stephen A Smith can once in awhile bring up decent analysis but his constant pushing of getting all stars in NY or LA makes him annoying as hell to me. If he was commissioner and had his way he’d have 15 teams in LA, 15 in New York and probably 2 expansion teams in Miami lol."
"Jason Whitlock, Jason McIntyre, Ryan Hollins, Kendrick Perkins, Stephen A Smith, Jay Williams, Chris Broussard. Did I miss anyone? Oh yeah and I legitimately think Skip is better than these dudes, which is saying something"
"I think the context of the scene works well and doesn't feel patronizing. It seems like they have genuine happiness for Chris to start working there and are excited for him. Either way, Will Smith does an excellent job in this movie. Probably one of his best roles."
"I can see this argument for the post-title Mavs (2012-19), but not from Dirk’s rookie year through 2011. Losing Nash sucked but they still got to the finals in ‘06 before finally winning one in 2011. Dirk had a pretty damn successful career.   Now 2012 to 2019 were pretty disappointing. Letting Chandler and to a lesser extent Caron Butler (since he technically didn’t play during the title run) walk after winning was abominable. Trading for Darren Collison, Lamar Odom, and Chris Kaman, signing OJ Mayo, the Rondo disaster, the Matthews and Parsons contracts, drafting Dennis Smith at 9…. I’m glad they could get Luka to be his successor but they really botched those post title years for sure"
Kenny: In about 24 seconds my wife will finally respond to me  Reggie: Thats how long it takes anyway   Another roast   Kenny: My team name is Aim High  Chris Webber: Your wife team name is Aim low   This was a Kenny Smith roast and all star draft
"The Warriors organization used to suck. Between Latrell Sprewell in 1992 and Stephen Curry in 2009, they didn’t pick a single player who became an All-Star   Just look at their first round picks since 1992:  1993- Penny Hardaway- Traded along with 3 1st round picks for Chris Webber who forced his way out after 1 season   1994- Clifford Rozier  1995- Joe Smith  1996- Todd Fuller  1997- Adonal Foyle  1998- Vince Carter- Traded for Antawn Jamison   1999- Jeff Foster  2001- Jason Richardson, Troy Murphy   2002- Mike Dunleavy Jr.   2003- Mickael Pietrus  2004- Andris Biedrins   2005- Ike Diogu   2006- Patrick O’Bryant  2007- Marco Belinelli   2008- Anthony Randolph   2009- *Stephen Curry*  2010- Ekpe Udoh   Outside of Curry, it was pretty much all bad. When they did pick a star, they managed to trade him away."
Jr Smith for the culture   AI Kyrie Chris Paul J Kidd Lebron Melo  Stat AD  Dwight Howard Delevedova
"There are lots of little guys in the league right now doing good stuff. Jalen Brunson, Ish Smith, Chris Chiozza are all solid guards in the league right now.   J.J. Barea and Isaiah Thomas were also huge for their team's success when they played."
"CP3, Magette, Danny Manning, Blake, DeAndre, Redick, Elton Brand, Jamal Crawford, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard is 10 alone  Then you have Bob Mcadoo, Randy Smith, Chris Kaman, Ron Harper, Bob Kauffman, Norm Nixon, Lamar Odom, World B Free, Quentin Richardson, Loy Vaught, Ken Norman, and many more probably   Also keep in mind that Beverly only played for the clips for 4 seasons and only average double digits once. Good defender for sure, but that alone puts so many other players ahead of him. For example you say Lamar Odom doesn't count but he was on the Clippers for the same amount of time as Beverly while having way more of an impact"
"Pelicans have less than 20 years of drafting, so not all that deep but pretty good:  Starters: Chris Paul, JR Smith, Zion, David West, Anthony Davis  Bench: Darren Collison, Buddy Hield, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Brandon Bass"
"As a Rockets fan I'd say any combination of 1990 x 2010. Imagine the 2017 Rockets, but instead of Clint Capela, you have the one of the greatest post players and defender's of all time. Chris Paul/Hakeem pnr would literally be unstoppably by any player outside of like Wilt, and you also have James Harden, who can also be an exceptional playmaker and the primary scoring option. You'd have to double-team Harden at the perimeter, and damn near triple-team Hakeem at the interior, which would let them kick out to shooters like Kenny Smith, who shot 43.8% his best year in Houston. On top of that, you'd have (slightly washed) Clyde Drexler, who averaged 22 and 36 3p%. Basically everyone in this lineup is an ELITE shooter except Hakeem, who can completely carry the defensive load on the interior. Drexler is also an elite defender, and Harden can do a serviceable job when pushed."
"Just because Harden can score doesn’t mean he is a great teammate   Playing with LeBron is not the same as playing with Harden   In his first season with Wade he went to the Finals, winning one the next year.   In his first season with Kyrie/Love he went to the finals; then won one the next year   In his first season with Anthony Davis he went to the Finals and won a championship.   LeBron has a proven track record of elevating other players’ games. As evidenced by the crazy contracts people like Mozgov and JR Smith got for example   What has Harden done to make his teammates better?  He flamed out in his one finals appearance.   Since then he has choked in every big playoff game he has played in.   Couldn’t get it done with Chris Paul or with Westbrook but Russ is the problem right?  Lol keep this same energy next season"
"Don't forget rookie Chris Bosh and Antawn Jamison. The following season rookie's Emeka Okafor, Josh Smith, Al Jefferson and Dwight Howard were added to the position as well. Howard and Jefferson both came in as PF's before transitioning to the center position a few years later. It was truly stacked back then."
"He isn't good. He got drafted pretty much on his own merits and washed out of the league.  Probably would be a good hustle guy at a level lower than the NBA, but he didn't put up any good stats in Europe either.  He is capable enough that the non-garbage time Thanasis bench units still generally outscored the opponent - there are plenty of worse players in the league.  He is much better than Chris Smith or Keljin Blevins, as after all, he probably would have made league even without Giannis in the first place, just likely wouldn't have gotten any second shot without Giannis."
2021: Jrue Holiday/Chris Paul  2020: KCP/Dragic  2019 Klay Thompson/Pascal Siakam   2018 Klay Thompson/JR Smith  2017 Klay Thompson/Kevin Love  2016 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2015 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2014 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2013 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2012 James Harden/Chris Bosh  2011 Ray Allen/Andrew Bynum  2010 Ray Allen/ Andrew Bynum  2009 Rashard Lewis/ Andrew Bynum  2008 Lamar Odom/Ray Allen  The only one I could compare Gordon too is JR smith and that team got swept.
He's no Chris Smith.
"Yep. Chris Smith was terrible in summer league but the Knicks kept him around and sent him to play for Erie, where he was one of the worst players in the G-League. He managed to get one minute of playing time in the NBA spread across two games. JR tried to demand they bring him back the next season but they didn't and ended up trading JR soon after. The worst part of it was Chris was already 26 and clearly had no professional potential.   Chauncey Billups also got his brother Rodney on the Pistons summer league team a couple times while he was playing there, but they never went as far as signing him."
"The links in that story for Kobe go to Jamar Smith, and Malone goes to Chris Dudley"
"What do you mean by deserves?  Blevins, Damion Lee, Thanasis, Chris Smith... maybe Gelo lol."
The NBA launched an investigation into Chris Smith to make sure it wasn't a way to pay JR under the table.  So bad the league fucking investigated him.

"Fair to need evidence.  Here are my thoughts.  1.  The gifts you describe are as a player.  Logic doesn’t hold whatsoever to think those translate to gm or executive success.  Obviously they COULD....but to assume they do is not a safe assumption. Basketball iqs and team leaders were also sky high for: Michael Jordan, magic Johnson, Kevin Mchale, Elgin Baylor, isiah Thomas, Willis Reed, Wes unseld and others and their performance in the front office was abysmal.  Now they are not Lebron so that’s not enough to conclude anything - but your statement about basketball iq and leadership meaning he has feel for selecting other players doesn’t hold weight to me based on a long history of others performing horribly when they try that transition.    2.  His achievements definitely speak for themselves, as a player.  Not as a team builder or in a sense playing gm/player with influence that we know him to be.    A list of roster moves and player issues that lead me to believe he is a horrible “gm” are:  - most recently prioritizing schroder, kuzma and then Drummond who was unplayable during crunch time.  There were many players available to get better and all 3 of these hurt their chances in 20-21.  - still on Lakers, trading away lonzo and Ingram while keeping kuzma.  Yes they got AD so that is the main thing but they kept the wrong guy, and that has hurt them for years to come in terms of building a roster around AD and Lebron as superstars.  - losing kyrie from the cavs and the trade for IT.  Huge deal that set Cleveland back many years.  Painful.   - on the cavs building around guys like JR smith and Kevin love not only set them back while Lebron was still there (jr smith finals issue), those moves are STILL setting Cleveland back as Kevin love continues to sap money without contributing   -  on the heat, there weren’t tons of player moves possible or required after they got the big 3.  Now Lebron surely helped the big 3 come together based on his playing influence, but it didn’t require an eye for talent or management skill to know that Chris bosh, wade, Lebron, ray allen, etc were good players to pursue a championship   - while on the heat there were few successes when actually selecting personnel.  For example, he was really high on Shabazz Napier and that failed miserably.   - I won’t keep going back year by year but in the early cavs years the same issues existed in my opinion.  Building around “his guys” led to teams that were average as supporting casts but could have been much better...and forced Lebron to win in spite of the talent around him.   These all only enhance how good he is as a player - I have heard countless times “how did he make the finals with ___ as his best players?”  But they are indications he does not know what he’s doing with roster building.   Those are my reasons.  I am failing to see the evidence that supports his gm skills or eye for talent.  What do you think lends credibility to saying he knows what he’s doing off the court?"
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.

"No it's even worse than that. They didn't have to attach a useful player in George Hill and a draft pick for Steven Adams. Then even worse, extending Adams when you're not sure he would fit with Zion. None of this is playing the result either, these were bad ideas at the time. Dell Demps at least traded for Jrue. Griffin's two best moves have been trading for Kyle Korver and trading Waiters for JR Smith and Shump. What a fucking disaster of a GM.  [“And I was the one on campus at UNLV,” he added. “I’m the one who got sold the bill of goods and I bought it hook, line, and sinker. You f— up sometimes.

"Funny enough it happened quite a bit to the Warriors. Chris Webber wanted out, Joe Smith wanted out, and Gilbert Arenas wanted out all within a span of like 5 years for the Warriors in the late 90s."

"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Knicks legend Chris Smith?!
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
"&gt;As part of a 3-team trade, the Detroit Pistons traded Chucky Atkins, Lindsey Hunter and a 2004 1st round draft pick (Tony Allen was later selected) to the Boston Celtics; the Detroit Pistons traded Željko Rebrača, Bob Sura and a 2004 1st round draft pick (Josh Smith was later selected) to the Atlanta Hawks; the Atlanta Hawks traded Rasheed Wallace to the Detroit Pistons; the Boston Celtics traded Chris Mills to the Atlanta Hawks; and the Boston Celtics traded Mike James to the Detroit Pistons.  Maybe that trade doesn't even happen if they drafted Melo, or maybe Melo gets thrown in.   A lot of what if scenarios here. But I have barely heard anyone say they would have been a dynasty if they drafted Melo lol"
"Another thing I found interesting about this game is that it reminds me that JR smith is an unofficial member of the banana boat crew. He played  with Chris paul, played on 2 different teams with Melo, and on 2 different teams with Lebron."
"I didn't even think it was open at any point in the last 6 months until the last few weeks.  In order for that team to realistically compete moving forward, they've got to hope Chris Paul continues to age like fine wine and that at least one of their young guys makes a leap.  I think Booker is who he is at this point, so you're hoping for development from Ayton or Jalen Smith.  Bridges and Cam Johnson are both older than Booker, so I don't think there's all that much more ceiling left for them."
[Yes.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/11/19/5121486/chris-smith-knicks-league-investigation-nba)
The Chris Smith signing was so bad that the NBA investigated it to make sure that his contract wasn’t an under the table way to pay JR.
After seeing JR Smith get his brother Chris into the NBA this doesn't surprise me whatsoever
"I just find it funny how the Hawks had good wings and bigs in Joe Johnson, Al Harrington and Josh Smith and needed a point guard to tie it all together and they took Marvin Williams over both Deron Williams and Chris Paul"
"Chris pratt is clearly presented as a movie character. ESPN is supposed to be real analysts giving their informed takes, not characters. Stephen A smith is presented as Stephen A Smith. Chris pratt is presented as starlord, not Chris Pratt"
"I broke it up so that it's easier to read:  &gt; It seems like this sub has a real hatred towards the Suns fans and the team. It might be because of Chris Paul b  &gt;ut this organization hasn’t been to the playoffs in 10 years and goes on a magical run I’d think that they would have support from neu  &gt; tral fans but it probably goes away for beating injured teams. But if people are hating them for beating injured teams the bucks beat an injured hawks an  &gt;d decimated nets team, but there is no hate there because giannis wasn’t on a super team. I think the bucks played great and credit to gian  &gt; nis for not leaving and their ring is 100% earned but had the Suns won people were giving us an asterisk which makes no sense. It probably goes down to Step  &gt; hen a smith calling booker kobe even tho booker himself and Suns fans have denied that comparison and they beat both L  &gt; A teams so there probably is a lot of people from LA pissed but it’s still so strange to me that this super young Suns team gets all that hate."
You’re obviously a big fan of his and I won’t disagree that he will probably have more winning seasons then not moving forward. Chris Oaul had Trevor Ariza and he battled with Kobe. Almost everyone you listed did better than Booker though.    Jrue Holliday and Andre Iguodala won more games than Books early Suns. Hell Josh Smith and the Pistons did. It’s not an indictment on him to recognize that. He didn’t have to win them all but he wasn’t even flirting with five hundred.

"Still was trash in the 2012 finals  Still was trash in 2/3 elimination games in 2013  &gt;the least they \[Josh Smith &amp; Corey Brewer\] can do is hit some fucking threes for harden lol  lol harden stans don't live in reality, it is actually insane. Brewer scored 15 in the 4th, Smith scored 14. The clippers scored 15 points in the quarter. **2 players outscoring the entire opposing team in the final quarter, and erasing the 17 point lead Harden let them build and saving the season = ""hitting some fucking threes for Harden""** (who was not even on the court). Amazing.  &gt;The warriors series was over after we went down 2-0 and nobody could provide harden with any help  (assuming you're talking about 2015, because I already admitted 2016 was more of an underperformance than a choke) [yeah man Harden totally never had a chance in either of the first 2 games](https://youtu.be/gVgr1kekBZM?t=74). And either way going 2/11 with 12 turnovers in an elimination game is still a massive choke lmao.  Your conspiracy theories about the concussion are batshit.  Seek help 💀.

You’re acting as if these were some down to the wire games where harden disappeared  Houston was winning by 2 going into the 4th quarter of game 2 and was tied going into the 4th quarter of game 3 lmaooooooo. But again, I know how hard living in reality is for Harden stans"
"He would have never faced the Warriors in 2015 if McHale didn't bench him in Game 6 against the Clippers and Josh Smith + Corey Brewer carried him. 2016, he played the Warriors without Steph Curry and still got his shit beat in. 2017, he gets blocked by geriatric Ginobili and in an elimination game without Kawhi Leonard, he went 2/11 from the field with 6 turnover and fouled out in the worst game from a superstar in history. 2018, he was the driving force behind a team who set a record in most missed shots in NBA history. In 2019, he couldn't beat a Warriors team with the best player in the world not playing. And in 2020, he once again got run off the court by the Lakers after demanding Chris Paul get traded for his buddy Westbrook."
"Playoff Rockets Josh Smith to the Hawks, caw caw!   Chris Paul to the Clippers, in all seriousness, would be deadly."

"The 05-06ish era of Chris Paul, bird man, JR Smith, David west New Orleans/ OKC Hornets were surprisingly likeable...I know that’s not clippers, just went on the Chris Paul tangent"
Talking about shit like Chris Smith (JR'S brother when he was on the Knicks) and Keljin Blevins (Lillard's cousin).  Thanasis definitely belongs in the NBA. He puts in rotation minutes for the Bucks. Even Kostas is pretty decent in the G League

I do think it’s important to note the distinction MOST of the panel makes between superteams that form with aging, past-their-prime superstars (like Chuck when he joined Houston or Malone and Payton to the Lakers) or superteams that form through a draft and superteams that form with superstars in their prime joining forces with one another.   Keep in mind this was shot around around the Miami Big 3 era so they won’t be talking about future superteam formations such as the one in Brooklyn or the Warriors when KD joined them.  Interestingly, the two on the panel who don’t think superteams are bad are Steve Kerr (the irony in that he’ll be coaching one in a few years after this discussion) and Kenny Smith: both serviceable role players but compared to the rest of the panel they’d be the non-superstars/leaders. Chris Webber brings up a very strong point to a passionately loud Kenny when Webber points out that Kenny is talking to players who had to lead the team on their backs."
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"

"I can't agree with this more.   I'll use Detroit as an example since that's one of the two teams I follow closest.   Between 2008 and 2015, we literally had seven different coaches.   That's an average of one per year.  That was the end of the 'contending' phase and the first five year of the rebuild.  Since the rebuild began, we had a lot of solid young talent come in and brought in some free agents. We had Chris Middleton, and Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond and Josh Smith. Brandon Jennings. Tobias Harris. Morris. Caldwell-Pope. Reggie Jackson. Kennard.  Ilyasova.    I'm certainly not making a case that any combination of those guys was going to be winning a championship.  But when young guys like Middleton, Harris, Drummond, and Monroe come in, and show some real potential, but then they get jerked around form one coach to another. One coach has Monroe run plays (effectively) out of the post, the next give Jennings the ball without (big mistake), it just established this turnstile of losing.  Young guys just trying to get there to get a pay day. No cohesion.   That's why I appreciate that teams like the Sixers, even though they got rid of Brett Brown, took the time to bring a player development guy in and just gave him 5 or 6 years without question."
"Their father def played a huge role in getting them to the NBA. I know his dad started manufacturing the hype machine back when Lonzo was in high school, but the only reason it worked is because Lonzo was looking like a great talent. He would have been a top 5 pick that year regardless of Lavar's antics. Same with Lamelo. You can say it helped Liangelo get some shine but there are other people who have gotten their brother's a shot in the league just off name recognition alone (JR Smith/Chris Smith etc).  They def owe Lavar but Zo and Melo were going to get some amount of hype regardless. But they owe him in the sense that every kid who has a good parent that helped you get to where you are should give back and show their appreciation."
"Well teammates like JR Smith, Channing Frye, Richard Jefferson, Iman Shumpert, Chris Bosh, Perk, Mike Miller, AD, and more.... all said he was. So he probably is."
"&gt;He's never had the supporting cast Jokic has enjoyed  I would like to point out that I think the Nuggets supporting cast is amazing but I feel like you're kind of acting like Carmelo only had scrubs on his team.  Chauncey Billups, Nene, Chris Andersen, J.R. Smith, Kenyon Martin are all solid second/third options and role players"
"Fellas, who would win:  Kyle Kuzma or Chris Smith?"
"Did you forget that there was a mega deal in place to send him to the Nets?    The Nets wanted to talk to Melo to make sure he wanted to be there.  And then, Melo refused to talk to them, which forced the Nets to pull out of a 14 player trade.  The Nuggets surrounded him with Allen Iverson, Chauncey Billups, JR Smith, Chris Anderson and previously Marcus Camby, Kenyon Martin and others.  They did all they could to win, but they had Kobe Bryant to go through and I’m sorry but Melo was never at that level.  Yet he wanted to see what management could do?  What the fuck more did he want?  Seriously.    The franchise did well by him, but when the time came to pickup a phone and say he would go to the Nets, he refused.    He forced the Nuggets to trade him for assets they didn’t want because Melo burned the bridge to for Nets, Chicago refused to trade Noah, and going to LA or staying in the west was a non-starter.  Melo only ever looked out for himself and made sure he got what he wanted."
Nuggets I like more than Melo:  Alex English  DavidThompson  Alphonso Ellis  Dikembe Mutumbo  Kenyon Martin  Marcus Camby  Chauncey Billups  A.I.  Kenneth Faried  Chris Anderson  JR Smith  Jokic  Murray  MPJ
"He’s great and has had fantastic numbers in the playoffs, he’s been very unlucky with untimely injuries either to him or to an important teammate (Blake) in the playoffs where his team ends up losing. Other than that, the Clippers choke from up 3-1 against the Josh Smith Rockers was horrendous but Chris Paul still had great numbers and played like the best player on the team (though he missed the first two games of the series). I don’t think the rest of his career he’s been on a team thats been in a real position to win it all. Only Rockets with Harden (CP3 injury) and the Clippers (bunch of injuries throughout the years to the stars). He obviously doesn’t get the respect a player of his caliber should because obviously he lacks a ring still in my opinion"
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
Hey put some respect on JSmoove name lmao   Or Josh “Chris Paul” Smith as a buddy of mine called him

"My reasoning for Josh Smith is in one of the other comments. As far as Rondo goes, I’m a Knicks fans so generally I don’t like Celtics but I did appreciate the hard nosed, pure PG play of Rondo during his tenure there specifically those later years when he was really dishing and he had a nasty floater and some good pump/head fakes in his game. A lot of people don’t like Rondo but I do, I also love it when he jars with Chris Paul whom I dislike."
"- We drafted MCW as a lead guard so we weren't going to sign another guard that year to take touches away from him  - We also had Evan Turner who was a primary ball handler and needed touches  &gt; Not expecting teams like that to sign Chris Paul, but you could've at least looked for a veteran point guard who could actually pass and open things up to give other guys opportunities  - When we got rid of MCW, we signed Ish Smith (a veteran) to compensate and help Nerlens develop as a PnR threat  - Mbah a moute was a veteran wing who was needed on that team as Covington hadn't developed yet and was still quite raw  - Mbah a moute and Nerlens actually lead us to have the 12th ranked defence that year which was our only point of pride  - Guys like Canaan were signed because we desperately lacked offensive firewpower, and at this point in the process we weren't about to trade away our picks to sign a veteran perimeter creator mid season...  - The next year was our worst year as we tried to play through Okafor and despite his best efforts, it was never going to be pretty. Okafor also unfortunately meant that our defence was terrible which was our one point of pride the preceding year (Defence plummeted to 26th)  - The next year was Embiid first year and we made a heap of trades to bring in experienced vets, they just happened to be terrible (Bayless and Henderson)  I just think your criticism is very unfounded. This team tried everything it could starting from an empty cupboard of assets. As soon as Embiid hit the court we were competitive and we haven't looked back"
Haha those are definitely the correct votes. Jokic is the MVP.  I just think people like Stephen A Smith and Chris Broussard shouldn’t have votes
"“No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals”.   LeBron did it.  “No team seeded 7th or 8th has ever won the NBA title”.   Looks like someone is gonna prove the world wrong again and we’ll have daily debates from Stephen A Smith, Max Kellerman, Skip, Shannon, Nick Wright, Chris B. Etc about the “goat conversation”.   Make a guess how long espn and undisputed will milk this debate for"
The 90's were rough lol.  Also Purvis was my favorite when I first started watching.   I think you can do about 10 other combos because same years but this is mine:  * Steph Curry 2009 * Andres Biedrins 2004 * Adonis Foyle 1997 * Donyell Marshall 1994 * Chris Mullin 1985 * Purvis Short 1978  * Phil Smith 1974 * Rick Barry 1965   **Philly Warriors:**  * Al Attles 1960 * Paul Arizin 1950 * Joe Fulks 46  Also bbref makes this pretty easy.

"I see where you're coming from. I still think there's flash but the most popular types of flash have changed. Like, Steph's crossover-to-stepback 30-foot trey balls with 22-seconds left on the shot clock are flash to me.   That said, there *are* times where I feel like today's players finally listened to the criticism previous generations always got about valuing the highlight over making the play. High flyers seem much more content with throwing down a routine quick-dunk with barely any hand-rim interaction these days. It's easy, it's efficient, it's certain. But I definitely miss so many dudes aching to break out into the open floor so they can flaunt their stuff.   I kind of think the 2000's may have been the golden era of dunking to this point. There were *so* many dudes unleashing funk back then - either via creativity (Vince Carter) or on account of murdering the rim (Kenyon Martin).   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Tracy McGrady  * Jason Richardson  * Ricky Davis  * Desmond Mason  * Stromile Swift  * Richard Jefferson  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Young LeBron James  * Dwyane Wade  * Young Andre Iguodala  * Kenyon Martin  * Gerald Wallace  * Young Josh Smith  * Young J.R. Smith  Then this whole second tier of not-quite-elite dunkers but still punishing finishers like Chris Webber, Chris Wilcox, Chris Andersen, Darius Miles, Jason Maxiell, slightly less prime Shaquille O'Neal, Rasheed Wallace, Jermaine O'Neal, Dahntay Jones, etc.   At times, it does sort of feel like we're just watching a 3-point factory night-in and night-out. But on that same token, in the 2000's, watching teams like the Atlanta Hawks could feel like watching an iso- or iso-post-up factory so to some degree you have to pick your poison."

Fun Fact: JR smith is younger than Chris Paul
JR Smith was Chris Paul's vet
"The 95 series was a close one and the Rockets won largely because Kenny Smith and Drexler were white hot from the 3 point range. Both the Jet and Drexler shot over 50% beyond the arc in that series and Drexler went 5 for 7 in the last game, despite being a 32% career 3pt shooter, foreshadowing the unexpected shooting clinic by Josh Smith and Corey Brewer crushing Chris Paul's playoff ambitions later.  Olajuwon was obviously great and I'd pick him for the #2 player of the decade too but I think it's often understated how much the shortened 3 point line helped the Rockets for their 2nd championship. The team was really perfectly set up to take advantage of it.   Also the peak prime Jazz was arguably a bit later in the decade, which unfortunately coincided with Jordan's return."
"He got his start with Chris smith, then jr smith, then carmelo (from when jr and melo were still on the Knicks) and melo is very well connected in the league"

"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."

"Yeah, Donatas Motiejunas was third in minutes for that team in the regular season, and they had Jet Terry, Terrence Jones, Prigioni, Josh Smith and Corey Brewer as crucial rotation players : almost all those guys were fringe NBA players.  That team was a young Harden, and basically nothing, the biggest and most underrated carry job in recent memory, mostly thanks to Chris Paul harmstring and the Clippers choking.  The Grizzlies, Jazz and Blazers were all way better teams (before Dame got injured), the 2017 Celtics yeah you may be right, since IT was done in that ECF"

"I've been noticing this for some time. It certainly seems to have become fashionable for a lot of guys to execute their dunks in as plain and routine of a way as possible.   It's hard to argue with guys just wanting to get the job done while utilizing minimal energy and creativity (this is likely big among the ""dunk is only worth two points"" crowd) but as a fan, I totally miss when guys seemed like they were dying to show what they could do to the rim when given the opportunity.   /u/honditar already mentioned so many, but it's pretty wild in hindsight to think back to how many entertaining dunkers there were just a bit over a decade ago.   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Jason Richardson  * LeBron James   * Desmond Mason  * Ricky Davis  * Tracy McGrady  * J.R. Smith  * Stromile Swift  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Kevin Garnett  * Darius Miles  * Amar'e Stoudemire  * Richard Jefferson  * Gerald Green  * Josh Smith  * Chris Andersen  * Dwyane Wade  Today's game is obviously still amazingly skilled and we're seeing shooting like we've never seen in NBA history but as a lifelong mega fan of the dunk, yeah, I miss it.   As an isolated example, tonight 20-year-old Sekou Doumbouya broke out into the open floor for a completely wide open fast break opportunity. Could have been a windmill, reverse, 360, or even just an emphatic one-handed hammer. Instead, we got slow motion skip step and one of those layup line drop-ins. And again, from a basketball game standpoint, that's totally fine (nice for Sekou to score either way) but I miss the funk."
"Chris Smith was soooo trash, and I’m a UL fan. It was laughable he was in the NBA. JR came to some UL games and was wild af."
JR Smith's brother Chris Smith is on my GOAT least qualified NBA player
so worse or better than Chris Smith I guess
Chris Smith has entered the conversation.
"You mean 2x club trillionaire Chris Smith?  Seriously, averaged 1 minutes and zeroes across the board in 2 games"
It pays off at very low percentages. Y’all got very lucky. Otherwise Patrick Ewing Jr. and Chris Smith would be running the league with Thanasis on the wing.
Does no one remember Chris Smith?
No one tell him about Chris Smith
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
"In 1997, the Vancouver Grizzlies traded a future first round pick with shrinking lottery protections over time for journeyman power forward Otis Thorpe, who was 35 years old. Thorpe played 47 games for the Grizzlies before being traded with Chris Robinson to Sacramento for Bobby Hurley and Michael Smith, neither of whom made an impact with the Grizz.  The Grizz sucked and kept getting lottery picks, and in 2003 the protection dropped to only the first pick. The ping pong balls fell the Grizzlies way; for the Detroit Pistons, for one of the greatest drafts in NBA history. The Grizz could have draft Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh.   The only happy thing about this is the Pistons drafted a bust in Darko Milicic.   The Grizzlies won 14 games in 1996-97, and I have no idea why they thought trading a first round pick for Otis Thorpe would make any sense."
"Yeah, if JR Smith could get his brother Chris Smith on to the Knicks in 2013, I'm pretty sure LeBron can get his son on to a team with him. Not to mention even without the nepotism factor, it might be worth a second round pick to just take a flyer on the kid growing a few inches and working out better than expected since you know whose kid he is."
"If Reggie had shot the same percentage as Klay on the same number of shots, he'd have made 158 extra 3s over 18 seasons, so less than 10 a season. If we do the opposite calculation for Klay, he'd have 103 less made 3s over 8 seasons, so about 12 a season.  Those numbers look underwhelming, but I think a better way to think about it is to bring in other players to compare. To get super specific, Klay is a career 41.9% shooter and Reggie is at 39.5%. So a 2.4% difference. Comparing Klay to Reggie, then, is like comparing Reggie to a career 37.1% shooter.  Chris Paul has that exact career average, and JR Smith is at 37.3%. It'd be ridiculous to say that JR and CP3 are basically equivalent 3-point shooters to Reggie Miller. But that's exactly what people are doing with Reggie and Klay in this thread."
"Calais is playing DE in a 3-4 that’s not an edge.  He’s an interior DLmen in the Ravens system.  I am literally a fan nobody would describe Calais as an edge he’s never lined up on the outside of the tackle.  Ravens edge defenders: McPhee, Tyus, Oweh, Hayes, Fergunsun, Chris Smith, and Houston."
Got nothing on JR Smith and Chris Smith on the knicks
So did [Portland](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillards-cousin-keljin-blevins-signs-two-way-contract-trail-blazers) and [New York](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/11/13/chris-smith-knicks-2-million)
It’s like JR &amp; Chris Smith all over again
That’s a good one. Chris Smith suuuuuuucked.
Right? This IS nepotism but it's a g-league contract. He's gonna get like 30k and won't get a second contract. It's a far cry from what actual nepotism happens in the league like how many NBA siblings get undeserving contracts like Zoran Dragic or Chris Smith. Chris Smith got a fully guaranteed contract and played like 1 full fucking minute that whole season.
When JR Smith's brother Chris Smith played for the Knicks an anonymous GM called him the worst player in the history of Summer League. I think Ziare has a chance to overtake him if he plays next year. Chris at least played 2 years in Louisville before sucking as a pro. I don't think Ziare even has a single offer from a school of that caliber
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
"Hakeem to Beat Embiid and Jokic in the 2020's, feast on Boucher and slow LeBron at the rim, slow Shaq, Duncan, Webber in the 2000's, feast on Longley/Rodman kinda for the 90's and hold up against Kareem in the 70's. Klay' shooting and defense is useful against any modern team, and he can probably slow older shooters like Bird and MJ a little. I think he'd fit with Hakeem because he's Kenny Smith but better at like literally everything. Hakeem was a serviceable ball handler but he could be a black hole so I'm going to say Chris Paul as playmaker and get the ball to Hakeem to the post and open looks to Klay. He can also serviceable score, which eases the burden from Hakeem, who can play more defense. I didn't watch the 70's or 80's but I'm hoping that Hakeem would slow their bigmen and Klay and CP3 would straight up outplay the older players."
"They are horrible, worst of the worse year in year out. Chris coward Cohen the Fromer owner of the team was a cancer… we traded tim hardaway for bimbo Fucking coles.  Bimbo coles. Think about all the players the franchise surrounded itself with, Bimbo Coles, adonal foyle (great dude btw just not good bball player), Todd fuller, joe smith , mike dunleavy jr, Chris porter, Jeff foster, Andris Birdrins, Ike diogu, Patrick Bryant ,   I don’t even wanna go in it’s depressing. I call those the dark ages of my fandom to gsw. So happy things are much better now :)))"
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP.

"I just base my knowledge on the dudes who played with him. Ertz, Cox, Kelce, Peters, Torrey Smith, Douglas, Chris Long, Lane, Celek etc. all support the dude.     The guys off the team were excited for him to get a new shot and the dudes on the team were sad to see him go. The locker room he lost appears to be the young dudes who haven’t proven much.    You’ve got Alshon, “Coach” Avant, and WIP.    Wentz was far from without fault, but at least I’ve reasons besides anonymous sources and gut feelings. That shits whack.    And I’m confident you parroted this nonsense before his vaccine stance so you should have info to support it besides that"
"Yes.  If I say JR Smith had the biggest choke job in basketball history and somebody brings up Chris Webber, it's not fucking whataboutism.  The only people have this conversation, that is to say someone else is worse, is to deflect away from their own racism, or charitably from the stress of thinking about their own racism and racism in their own community.  It's a problem everywhere.  Like people rationally understand racism is a big problem everywhere, right?  Just because you have kind friends and a diverse community in Houston or wherever else doesn't mean Texas is free of racism. It's the same thing here."
"Look at all the players that have gone into the booth or become talking heads.  Do you think those players would make good coaches?  Barkley, Shaq, Kenny Smith, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Chauncey Billups, TMac, Paul Pierce, Stephen Jackson, Matt Barnes, Scottie Pippen, Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Jalen Rose.  Out of all those dudes the only people I would for sure want coaching a team would be Chauncey and Kenny, Chauncey is getting his chance and Kenny is currently looking iirc.  Others that I think could coach if they wanted would maybe be Jalen, Channing, and RJ mayyyybe TMac.  But there's also the question of are they even interested in coaching?  There's ~500 players in the League right now, I'd be willing to bet that a huge majority aren't even interested in coaching.   &gt;While the players who are black who remain involved in the sport are talking heads or in the booth almost exclusively.  Complete bullshit ""almost exclusively""  Out of all the big talking heads I named one is currently going to be a coach, and another has been interviewed.  Mark Jackson became a coach and sucked, Tyronn Lue and Doc Rivers have been out there for a good minute.  Jason Kidd is out running around even though he has a very questionable domestic + coaching past.  Nate McMillan, David Fizdale, Dwane Casey also.    If we look farther back we have Larry Drew, Lenny Wilkens, KC Jones, etc. etc. probably quite a few others I don't know"
I saw Chris paul his rookie year walking around OKC (hornets - when they relocated for Katrina) and talked to him for a little bit. Super nice guy. Also saw JR smith and he was ok but didn’t really wanna talk to people   Met willis reed and he was cool. I shook his hand and they were HUGE
You are selling Chris Smith short. NBA launched an investigation to see if he actually was NBA quality
"Let's get a whole class going.  Players:  Chris Smith.  Literally only was in the NBA because of his brother, JR Smith.   Ricky Davis for shooting at his own basket to get a rebound for a triple double.  Ben Simmons is one of the better players to get into this hall but yeah.  Coaches:  David Fizdale for obvious reason.  Luke Walton for even more obvious reasons.  Executives and FO:  Cavaliers in LeBron's first run.  They built no good supporting him around him for years and gets mad when he rightfully bailed.  Isiah Thomas.  A rarity to go in the HOF and this HOS.  Great player and did have a decent eye for talent but his roster management was absolutely horrible and destroyed the Knicks organization for about 10 years.  Like the pick used by Chicago to get LaMarcus Aldridge was initially the Knicks pick they traded to get Eddy Curry.  Then theres whole sequel assault/harassment stuff.  Teams:  The 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats.  In the lockout shortened year they had a record of 7-59 which is the record for the worth win% of all time."
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.

"He had Josh Smith as his 2nd option in 2015 against the Warriors which you asked about earlier. Dwight was on that team but was injured and declining. It’s weird how you build up Rockets Dwight and act like Miami Shaq was a role player.   And with Chris Paul he was up against the KD-Warriors (debatably the best team of all time) until CP3 went down with injury.   With Westbrook, Westbrook also got injured and got COVID. He then got traded and just snuck into the playoffs as the 8 seed.   And I never said Harden never had help, I just pointed out that Harden carried multiple teams to the playoffs every year regardless who was beside him. That isn’t true for Wade.  And the refs gave Wade what, 50 FTs in the final 2 games?"
"Lonzo, Drummond, Westbrook, Derozan, Zach Randolph, Joakim Noah, Josh Smith, Paul Millsap, Stoudemire, Bynum, Wiggins, Carmelo Anthony  And finally:  *Chris Paul*"

"The Knicks are a pretty safe choice.  There are highs, lows, and all kinds of odd anecdotes and characters to include in the doc.  The #Knickstape Era alone has all kinds of fuckery to pull upon.  Like, there was totally a period of time when JR Smith’s brother, Chris Smith had a roster spot.  It’s fun to poke and laugh at the Knicks, but if they were given the Dorktown treatment, it’d be easier to empathize with them and root for their success.  Oh, and there’d be a Linsanity episode, so you already know the people would *love* that."
"&gt; Sekou just sort of fucked off back to France during the Covid shutdown iirc, and then it seems like he did the same during Summer League  Both instances were reported to be coordinated with the team (although initially the reporting said otherwise when he went back to France at the start of lockdown) so theoretically those shouldn't have been black marks on his record; but it also wouldn't surprise me if the Pistons claiming they were looped in was just PR damage control. Regardless of the truth of either matter, his intensity (specifically his ability to play through contact) has been a consistent issue so I think the underlying criticism is fair  &gt; My intuition says Weaver values culture and attitude as much as skill or potential and he decided no amount of G-League was going to make him the type of player he wants to keep.  I might take a more mild position that regardless of whether or not Sekou could become the type of player Weaver wants, he just didn't want to spend the time waiting for him to become that when-- as an excellent scout/talent evaluator-- he probably feels he can find a guy with a shorter timeline in the draft/free agency. Chris Smith feels like he might be that type of guy and Pickett seems like someone who could do just as much if not more than what Sekou brings right now even if his ceiling is lower.  Ultimately I'm not gonna lose sleep over the move. I liked Sekou and think that he really could be a Siakim type guy one day but that day wasn't gonna be this year or next and for a GM who navigates the cap as clunkily as Weaver has so far, I'm not totally surprised that he decided to just call it quits now and get a little value back while avoiding having to navigate an extension for a player who's resume is primarily made up of gleague minutes."
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
"Well... I'm a Raptors fan and Pistons fan.   With regard to the Raptors, I'd have to say there haven't really been 'dark days.'  Nothing like what the Kings are going through of the Clippers have gone through, or even the Warriors.   At first, it was exciting just to get a team. We got the ROY our first year. We got some great and entertaining talent early on (McGrady, Camby, and Carter).  Had some playoff runs with Carter, he left in the worst way possible, but we picked up Chris Bosh shortly there after.   Had some more playoff appearances. Lost Bosh, and then started toward building what eventually led to a championship.   The Pistons are likely in their darkest days since the 70s.   We build a contender through the 80s, getting deeper and deeper in the playoffs each year before winning back-to-back.   Had a rebuild that started out well. First got to watch Rodman tear it up with rebounds, lost him in a trade, then drafted Allan Houston. Lost him but got Grant Hill, who was on his way to becoming the best all-around player in the league.   Lost him, but got Big Ben in return.   Got to watch amazing rebounding and defensive performances, and the pieces slowly came together. Tore up the league, beat the Lakers (AGAIN) to win a title back-to-back finals, then eventually traded Billups and everything went down hill.   And since then, it has been almost 15 years since we won a playoff series.   Sure... we've had some entertaining talent along the way. A year of Blake. Some nice rebounding seasons out of Drummond. A sweet old school post player in Monroe. But horrible signings that looked promising (even if questionable) that didn't pan out (Josh Smith) and a bad trade that was the result of mandates from new management (Jennings).   And the draft? We passed up on Klay for Brandon Knight? FUCK!!! I was pissed THAT NIGHT!! And have grown more pissed since, watching what Klay turned into.   We got Greg Monroe, who looked great, but we passed up on Hayward and Paul George in the process.   Then we got KCP over McCollum.   Stanley Johnson? Over Booker, Oubre, and Myles Turner? I mean... it was like shooting fish in a barrel that draft, and we still missed.   Got Luke Kennard ONE PICK before Donavan Mitchell and a few ahead of John Collins.   The team has just drafted SO poorly over the last 15 years."
If they want to push for another finals run they might have to give up a young asset. I wouldn’t really view it as giving up on him as much as they have a limited window to try to win with Chris Paul and may not want to wait 2-3 years for Jalen Smith to develop.
"Chris Webber leaving after his rookie year.  Sprewell attacking Carlesimo and being traded for spare parts   Not being able to resign Arenas after his breakout because of weird rules about 2nd round picks  \#1 overall pick Joe Smith being dumped for nothing after a couple years because he wasn't going to re-sign.     Even when they stumbled into talent, the Warriors couldn't keep them because nobody wanted to be here."
Westbrook for shooting. Chris Paul for dunking. JE Smith for BBIQ
"&gt;Why yes I can. I spent 10 years thinking about exactly that. Think Chris Paul and Joe Johnson and Josh Smith would have been any good?  IIRC, Joe Johnson didn’t play for the Hawks until 2005-06? I’m not sure if that trade for Diaw happens, but there was probably limited sign and trade offers available.  The Hawks probably suffer for another 1-2 years and respectively are able to move up in at least the 2006 NBA Draft.  They probably end up with CP3, Smith and LaMarcus Aldridge."
Why yes I can. I spent 10 years thinking about exactly that. Think Chris Paul and Joe Johnson and Josh Smith would have been any good?   Instead we got years of Speedy Clayton and the dried up corpse of Mike Bibby. I don’t generally believe you should worry about drafting for for current fit too much at #2 but goddamn that pick was a disaster for the Hawks.
"The Hawks' point guard dilemma was never resolved, which is kind of hilarious.  Could you imagine Chris Paul throwing lobs to Josh Smith?"
Chris Smith and the Knicks. Didn’t even start at Louisville and was a garbage player. But his bro was JR and he was repped by Leon Rose
