"That Heat-Mavs game in Miami in Luka's rookie season where a bunch of slovenians went to the arena and chanted all game long was incredible! I hope that someday there'll be portuguese players in the league and I can feel that same pride, even though it looks like our best chance to make it in decades (Neemias Queta) made a mistake not declaring for the draft after his freshman year, he's probably going to be undrafted which sucks"

Yet again Neemias Queta is my number 1 pick
He'll go 2nd after neemias Queta
So Neemias Queta n1 pick?
Idk where he‚Äôs projected but Neemias Queta could be a late 1st round/second round steal. He‚Äôs built in the mold of someone like Rudy Gobert but he has fantastic hands and showed he could step out and shoot the 3 as well. He‚Äôs currently ranked like the 4th best center in the draft. The dude averaged a ridiculous 3.3 Blocks per game at Utah State and for a 7-footer he‚Äôs got pretty quick feet. Some weaknesses was he was turnover prone and would take plays off every now and then

"Very excited for Neemias Queta, set to be the first Portuguese to play in the NBA. Hope he joins the Bucks!"
"Other people have mentioned this, but I think Kuminga falls. I think his reputation from preps play kept him high in mock drafts, but we are getting no buzz about some team being super into him and I just am not convinced he is actually that good or that high upside.   Assuming Barnes goes top 5, I think the Thunder take Giddey at 6, highest upside player they could find there.  If he falls past them, I actually think the Warriors take him.  And Magic take Moody if the Warriors don't.  Wagner goes to Kings at 9 and is actually a good pick.  Knicks draft Sharife, Thibs loves quick guards and they could use someone that can get to the rim and make plays even without spacing.  Their other pick could be a shooter, like Chris Duarte, a good fit in a Thibs offense, Corey Kispert, or Trey Murphy.  Bucks draft Joel Ayayi.  Might be wrong, but that is the vibe I get based on what I know of the sorts of players Bucks typically value.  All around player from a good NCAA team who can play off the ball well.  I could see them taking Neemias Queta too.  I think Keon Johnson might be a draft slider, while I think Springer actually goes to Pacers at 13.  Tough for non-shooting guards in the league, have to have special characteristics."
"I'm Portuguese, we've never had a player in the league, the GOAT right now is probably Carlos Lisboa who had a few NBA teams scouting him but he never made it, in today's NBA he probably would have made it since its a lot easier for international players to get in. Neemias Queta (in the draft this year) will probably overtake Carlos Lisboa if he carves out any sort of role in the NBA."
Neemias Queta as of right now
"Neemias Queta, is going to be our first Portuguese player in nba, Im very proud of him"
"Neemias Queta  This year 2nd round pick 7‚Äù tall, big body"
" I saw him at Texas. He wasn‚Äôt the greatest defender mainly because he would sometime overplay. A guy like Neemias Queta is better than him all around. Sims needs to work on his offense, or be like Tristan Thompson, and use his wingspan and length to his advantage and become a great offensive rebounder. Prime Tristan Thompson was great at that."
"Nothing against the Kings, I actually like them now that they have Neemias Queta, but how funny would it be for them to pass on a big talent again?"
Kings dumb af. Neemias Queta &gt; Alex Len and Tristan Thompson
"Lakers are going to have a bounce back season. 2020 people didn't believe them as much, but they proved that, almost fully healthy, they are an absolute force on defense and a healthy LeBron can turn any roster into a competent offensive roster. I don't think Russ will be that bad of a fit and he'll adjust well into his role, and a lot of veterans are going to play an important role on a championship run. They're also trading for Hield or a certified marksman or 2 this offseason,  I also think Davion Mitchell will be ROTY, Scottie Barnes will end up being the best player in the draft and Neemias Queta was the steal of the draft"
Bout to happen again with Neemias Queta tho
Okay but Neemias Queta is the Wilt Chamberlain of Portugal
Realisticly it would be Alpereb Sengun. But I'm going with the crazy pick and say Neemias Queta.
Say it with me now  NEEMIAS. QUETA.
"Being Portuguese, I‚Äôm immensely proud of Neemias Queta to become the first Portuguese national to play in the NBA. Sacramento is actually a great fit and I bet Shaq had actually something to do with him being drafted there."
Lets go Neemias Queta!! Pick no.39 but First pick ever for Portugal in the NBA
Yes and his name is Neemias Queta
Any predictions on Neemias Queta?
Any predictions for Neemias Queta?
neemias queta
"Damn i know zero about the nba, i just want neemias queta to get picked. That looks more scary now. Thx for the explanation!"
Neemias Queta just because I‚Äôm an Aggie and I think it‚Äôs cool he will be the first Portuguese nba player
"Bold Predictions:  - Jared Butler will be a border line all-star  - Bouknight is a bust  - Bones Hyland, Trey Murphy III, JT Thor, Neemias Queta, Isiah Livers are the 2nd round steals"
"Neemias Queta is going to become the first ever Portuguese player to go to the NBA, tonight.  üáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπüáµüáπ   To the team that lands you're gaining a fan for life."
"It's very tough, but it's for a good reason :)  &amp;#x200B;  Super excited for the draft, mostly because of Neemias Queta"
Honestly an overpay for Culver.  Would MUCH rather we got Jason Preston or Neemias Queta (especially with King Kongwu missing 6 months) at 48
"Spain. Portugal's been pitiful in terms of a National Basketball team, so we're not making it (although Neemias Queta will be the first portuguese player in the NBA). But, for once, Imma show love to our neighbors simply because of how fucking awesome Pau is"
Neemias Queta
"Hassan Whiteside is one of the funniest players in the league, but he‚Äôs gone now.   I think Neemias Queta (on a 2-way) is intriguing though. 7-foot paint protector with some offensive upside. he‚Äôs the first Portuguese player drafted which is cool too, brought some new fans to the franchise"
"[Post inspiration from seven years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2fbisv/best_5man_team_of_nba_players_by_first_letter_of/).  What's your team when you use your last name?  What's the best team?  The weakest team besides 'X'?  I also added players in this year's draft to fill in spots, they were selected by the NBA so it's good enough. The two were Neemias Queta and Marcus Zegarowski, both second round picks."
"There are tons of Portuguese redditor asking about Neemias Queta who is a second round draft pick on the Kings. One of my highest upvoted comments was one where I responded to someone and said that ""I hope he gets some burn with the team."""
I drank the Neemias Queta cool-aid after the draft.  In my head he's a future 3x DPoY.
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
I would say the same for Neemias Queta
Play Neemias Queta
