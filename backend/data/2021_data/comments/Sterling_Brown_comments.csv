Milwaukee is pretty racist.  The cops attacked and tased Sterling Brown over a routine traffic stop.  I could definitely see players not wanting to come to Milwaukee.  Also it's one of the most segregated cities in the US.
And LeBron is better than Sterling Brown in my opinion
This sub was way more outraged over the Montrez incident than it ever was about Sterling Brown or Thabo Sefolosha
Where’s Sterling Brown???
"john wall, christian wood, demarcus cousins, pj tucker, danuel house, sterling brown, tate at some point is word. all houston rockets"
The Bucks really couldn't find any minutes for Sterling Brown?
i'm happy for sterling brown
"You keep calling me delusional but I think you’ve missed the point countless times, your future is that of mediocrity and being a bottom feeder in the east. 8 years ago you guys were good, you said in recent years the Pacers had more success but in those “recent” years they never made it out of the first round. Second off, the young talent I mention includes Mason Jones, Jasean Tate, and Sterling Brown. Obviously you haven’t watched any Rockets game, or even checked a box score. So if you have any valid points I would love to hear them, I can’t wait for your rebuttal just to say I’m “delusional” again. LOL"
"I like House. But we’re pretty set on wings right now with Jay’Sean Tate, Sterling Brown, Oladipo, and even Mason Jones."
Sterling Brown is in silk robes and kimonos
"He called Bruce Brown, Sterling Brown. Sterling Brown is on the Rockets"
"They should unless injuries somehow get worse than they already have been.  They've emerged looking good from the toughest part of their schedule with about a third to half of their team out on basically every given night.  OP didn't even list Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Jae'Sean Tate, David Nwaba and Sterling Brown who have all proven to be very solid depth pieces... Plus, BOOGIEEE!"
"1, 2 is Wall/Wood or Wood/Wall right now (I'm doing this with Dipo left out of the equation)  So that would make 3/4... Probably Eric Gordon, Sterling Brown. We have a lot of guys scrapping for that '4th/5th best' spot rn and House is still injured.   However I'll add the caveat that boogie is our 3rd best player if you only count the minutes he plays in games where he gets ejected. It's some sort of curse I swear to God. Either he plays meh out there for a whole game or he starts picking up steam and making an impact, and then immediately gets tossed."
You forgot about our goat Sterling Brown ?!!!!!!!!!!!! How dare you
"Good showing from the baby Rockets, especially Mason Jones and C Wood.   Can’t wait till we get John Wall, Eric Gordon, Boogie, Danuel House, and Sterling Brown back into the lineup. We still haven’t played a game at full strength."
Rockets are really struggling to score with Rockets legend Sterling Brown
"Sterling Brown played too well last game, and now he's out. Who's next? Mason Jones? Mclemore?"
This is a stupid post. Sterling brown was not almost jobless and there would have been plenty of teams trying to sign him.  He was a regular rotation player for a 60 win team two years in a row
"&gt;Are there any absolutely absurd increases across the league for an individual player who normally was like idk below league average before the pandemic but this season is shooting in the 40% range?  There's a load of absurd 'increases' because the sample size is so small. KCP, Connaughton, Millsap, Sterling Brown, etc."
I remember watching him outplay Jabari Parker in the Illinois high school state tournament and thought wow why doesn’t anyone talk about this Sterling Brown kid. Pretty cool that he’s made it in the NBA as a solid rotation player
My favorite thing is when people whine about the NBA players and social justice you can bring up Sterling Brown and then they try to change the subject or ignore it.
"Stolen from u/dhighway61:  The year is 2023. The Rockets have just come off a deflating loss in the WCF.  Wood averaged 30/12 throughout the playoff run. Sterling Brown put up a career playoff high of 54 in game 7, but it wasn't quite enough, as they lose in overtime. Jae'Sean Tate led all playoff players in triple doubles.   Your phone goes off. It's a twitter notification. Shams reports that the Rockets have signed James Harden to a veteran's minimum deal. He's coming back.  He brings his championship experience to the locker room and the court. The Rockets go 74-8 en route to a 4-4-4-4 sweep in the playoffs.   Never underestimate the heart of a champion."
Downtown Sterling Brown is the man
Friendship ended with Harden. Now Sterling Brown is my best friend.
Totally fair. Sterling brown is a solid defender but that's about it. And it's sad they had to put KJ on christian wood late to slow him down. :(
"Third time in his career that Sterling Brown has 20 points, that's really cool for him."
James Harden who? We got Sterling Brown
Don't think for a second that Sterling Brown didn't know what he was doing. He knew exactly what he was doing.
Sterling brown finally gets to be the #1 option like he always played like he was. Good for that dude.
"Tillman is beside himself, begging Stephen Silas (thru texts) to bench Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown next game."
"Brooklyn who? The real super team is Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown."
"I AM ALL IN ON THE CHRISTIAN WOOD, JOHN WALL, DEMARCUS COUSINS, STERLING BROWN, JAE'SHAUN TATE ROCKETS  EWING THEORY SZN"
"Just one day after trading Harden, the Rockets went on an 13-4 run to close out a nationally televised road win against a surging Spurs team.   [Serious] Was James Harden dead weight for the Rockets? Also, should the Rockets offer the max to Sterling Brown?"
"friendship with harden over, sterling brown is my new best friend"
"Brooklyn who? The real Big 3 is Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown."
Sterling Brown was wylin tonight. Also who is this Tate guy
"Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown are gonna be held out next game for sore elbows."
sterling brown for 3 O_O
Sterling Brown was a really good low-key pick-up for us.
"Sterling Brown with 0/4 3PT lmao, same old Sterling.  Treat him well Houston, he's a good bench player"
Yea now they get to watch sterling brown at pg
Sterling Brown and Christian Wood going to be their Point Guards tonight? lol
"Sterling Brown, Danny Green, nice band from 00's and a bakery? that's a sick bench"
Sterling brown is awesome I miss him on the bucks.
Tough way to remember you're Sterling Brown and not Shannon Brown.
"Yes, the number 1 issue is the defensive personnel (or lack thereof).  And like you said, Silas is trying to run an offense that he doesn't really have the roster for, since a large part of the roster (Harden, Tucker, Gordon, McLemore, House) are used to running MDA's offense. It's getting messy trying to integrate Wall, Wood, and Boogie, as well as Sterling Brown and Tate (who I really like) into a group that's already been playing MDA's offense for a while and getting them to play a lot of ball movement. Wall isn't even passing that much, he's just driving to the rim or taking 3s - Harden's the one racking up assists."
"Dave Nwba, Sterling Brown and Ben McLemore being a key part of your rotation is probably more damaging than 1 guy not buying in....  Seriously, where the hell did people think the rockets were going with this roster?"
That’s the Sterling Brown bucks fans know
AD's face need to be a meme after the block on the Sterling Brown dunk attempt
Sterling Brown was 25.
sterling brown? the dude from the bucks?
"Suns have the best bench. Pacers and Spurs are up there too  Our bench is pretty good. We are 6th in +/-  Gordon, Boogie, Mclemore, Nwaba, Tate, Sterling Brown are all solid guys"
It’s different this time around.  We have Sterling Brown
Kings should trade for Sterling Brown and Immanuel Quickley to fix this problem. Reason being.....  Le-quick Brown Fox double jumps over the L*** D**
Sterling Brown
it was sterling brown iirc
Harden   Wall  Wood  Gordon  House   Tate  Tucker  Are safe. So I suppose David Nwaba or Sterling Brown
"Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Tobias Harris, Julius Randle  Also I think PG13 will take a small hit as well."
I really like what Sterling Brown has done for us this season so far.
"Plus you still got a PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Sterling Brown.  I hope Harden stays."
"LMM u mean. Anyway, I really do believe we have the young pieces that can develop into elite defenders. Tate Nwaba and Sterling brown."
"A bit different than last year but I can see the similarities. But the differences between last year and this year are as follows.   This year they’ve got a pg that fits with Harden better imo. Wall is a better defender, shooter and while not on his level passing wise, wall is a great playmaker at his best. They’ve added two versatile bigs in Wood(looks like he’ll be a star) and Demarcus Cousins. Last year they didn’t have a single actual big in rotation.   And like always they’ve always got their assortment of wings like Tucker, House Jr, Gordon(if he can play to a 6th man level he’d be their X-factor) as well as Tate, Sterling Brown, etc."
Sterling Brown and Christain Wood co-MIP
Sterling Brown 6MOTY trade EG
sterling brown is HOT rn. Why did the Bucks let him go?
sterling brown seems to be a good pickup for the rockets
Bucks fans told me Sterling Brown sucks
"Excuse you my man but Silver has been shit before 2019 with Masai. John Henson, Thabo Sefolosha, Sterling Brown, and Sam Hinkie all got something to say. But yeah, fuck Silver for sure."
Sterling Brown will pass him one day
"Say that to Sterling Brown, Thabo Sefolosha, Bill Russell, Masai Ujiri and Jon Henson who have all not had the choice to ""stay out of it""  LeBron even had his home gratified with racist rhetoric. GTFO Zlatan"
"Not speaking up for Sterling Brown,  John Henson, nor Thabo Sefolosha. His mishandling of the China/Honk Kong incident w Morey. Forcing the Sixers ownership to get rid of Hinkie and forcing Colangelo on us. Dogwhistle comments regarding Masai as well. Silver just happens to be a better than commissioners than the others, but I don't even credit him for that. He can't act as outlandish as the others since this is a player dominant league."
"Don’t recall him standing up for Sterling Brown, John Henson, or Thabo Sefolosha either."
"I'm not going to lie I havent finished the last couple of games out of boredom. I tune in to watch Tate, Nwaba, Sterling Brown and Mason Jones if he plays. They are all bundles of energy and it's been a long time since I have seen players on the Rockets hustle as hard as they do minus Tucker."
He looks like sterling brown😂
Not to mention what happened to Sterling Brown...
Wrong. That would be Sterling brown
"Agreed. Also, as much as I think Sterling Brown and Nwaba are great players, I don't think they're part of our timeline for the future, and it kills me to see them getting minutes over Mason Jones, who has shown tremendous potential in his limited minutes.   We also need to find optimal playing time for KPJ when they decide to bring him over."
You don’t even know me.   Sterling Brown was a bad mother in high school.  Maybe the best basketball game I’ve ever seen.
Tell that to Sterling Brown
"Your perfect NBA example of that is Sterling Brown turning down a $400,000 settlement from Milwaukee because the settlement didn't include the police acknowledging that they fucked up. Ended up settling for $750,000 plus an admission that his rights were violated."
cant be worse than bryn forbes defensively and he offers more in half court offense than pat and craig..I just hope bud doesnt Christian wood or sterling brown him.
Nah you see once you have money as a minority you aren't a monority anymore. Nevermind years of being a minority prior or still being a minority in the eye of LEOs.  There are countless stories like Thabo Sefalosha or Sterling Brown. Or guys that get stopped and harrassed because they drive nice cars.
"I would not want to be my skin colour living in the US. There's a reason i'm glad we moved away to europe as a family.  Who knows i might be dead instead of at UNI right now if i had stayed in the US.  You don't have these issues on that scale in most other countries.  And to your point about ""privilege"". I guess it's privilege to have your leg broken like Thabo Sefalosha or getting harrassed and attacked like Sterling Brown."
I’m not saying they didn’t dominate us. Just we started the 4th quarter with  Mason Jones running PG- Nwaba- Sterling Brown- Jasean Tate- Ben Mac
"Sterling Brown deflects it though, still a heads up shot from Caleb Martin though."
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
We barely avoided the natural disasters that are Sterling Brown and Kelly Olynyk
Surprised a contender didn’t try getting Sterling Brown. He’s legit a good 3/D
Y’all took Sterling Brown and Wood so it goes both ways
"How can you objectively say that Trae didn't look back at Brown?  Ignoring your laughable takes, there's literally a video of Trae crossing over behind the back, then looking back at Sterling Brown before making the three."

sterling brown was mad as fuck after that. but hey basketball is hard when youre not Trae Young
His name is sterling brown
I remember the Sterling Brown incident had a lot of fans talking about how players should leave Milwaukee because of it... OK. So they should escape to the open caring arms of LAPD instead??  It is an American problem.
Yeah he really should've got Sterling Brown and Justin Patton wide open looks.

"Ahhhh the classic he’s attacking one team so I’ll go at his even though they aren’t relevant to the conversation. But I’ll bite.      For starters we’ve had 7 picks in the past 5 years, the highest being 10th overall. 3 first rounders and 4 second rounders that have averaged out to 33rd overall draft position. Yes thon sucked ass but we immediately made up for it by snagging brogdon. Thon was also our only lottery pick we didn’t have the luxury of picking in the top 5 all those times. Sterling Brown is an nba rotational player which is you’re more than happy with with a second round pick. DJ Wilson sucks ass not gonna defend that one but our GM was also hired like 2 days before the draft so he was put in a bad spot. Donte was a fantastic pick at 17 and looks like he could be a really good starter. Nwora and Merrill it’s too early to tell but they’re both 45+ picks anyway so nbd if they don’t pan out. All in all you have one high end starter, another solid starter, and at least one rotational player. When your picks average out to a high second round pick I’m gonna take that haul any day.       Don’t get me wrong I think you can absolutely blame the bucks FO for why we haven’t won a title yet but most of that stems from cap mismanagement rather than drafting. Bledsoe (more or less thorough that’s a whole different discussion) over brogdon obviously didn’t work out, snell was a bad contract, we had to give a lot for Jrue cause that was our only way of getting a great player, and guys like Larry Sanders are still on the fucking payroll hamstringing us further. Quite frankly we haven’t **had** the draft capital to make a huge impact and have done pretty solid overall imo because of it.      But back to the actual argument I’d say it’s a lot easier to hit on picks when you have 3 straight 2nd overall picks rather than your highest being 10th overall. And It can’t be a coincidence that literally every one of the players they’ve drafted has found more success with someone else. I understand they played a role in helping develop some of them but I do think it was a pretty small role considering the results they found elsewhere."
"Huh, I guess that only applies to a buyout then.   I think trading Dinwiddie would be our only option. Houston would have to attach their least desirable, low salary guy to make salaries work.  For example: [Dinwiddie and a second for PJ Tucker and Ben Mclemore](https://tradenba.com/trade-machine) technically works.   This assumes Dinwiddie is out all year and is leaving in FA. It also assumes HOU can't get better than a second for PJ and can't get anything for Mclemore (Sterling Brown, Nwaba, House Jr., Porter Jr., and Tate also work salary-wise) which might not be true. Houston's cap hit goes up a tiny bit, but they stay under the tax."
Sterling Brown has recovered nicely from his strip club beating /s
His actual brother is Sterling Brown too
"he helped make his own bad situation. his scheming and play designs are good, and he should be a good coach for the future. but he handled the players he did have very poorly particularly early in the season. harden gave them some fire and good timing gave them weak opponents to get a win streak. but silas seemed to buy into the false hype and overplayed the vets and underplayed the young guys. which only resulted in more injuries and less capable players down the roster. he particularly mishandled mason jones and sterling brown not utilizing the skills they do have and with mason jones who was one of their best shooters he and wall straight up told him not to shoot and his 3s tanked because of what they told him. that was extremely distasteful. he has improved after the deadline and reality forced them to realize they are not competing this season. but he still seems he would rather play names over usefulness."
"Defense is their biggest issue easily. And having both BI and Zion does not make this an easy problem to solve   Keep Adams. It wasn’t a great move but he’s there and he’s decent.  Some guys I’d try to get in a trade or in the offseason: Kris Dunn, Ariza, Crowder, Klebler, DFS, Sterling Brown, Nwaba, Portis  Basically getting defensive and/or shooting power on this team. BI/Zion should be able to handle the scoring majority and if they can’t, BI needs to go because having both of them in the front court makes being even an above average defensive team a tough thing to imagine"
Rockets have 1.  Sterling Brown at 42%.  Goddammit.
Most recently DJ wilson. Sterling brown was that dude for a while... Christian Wood... Johnny o bryant... Tobias harris
"Why can't he take credit for KPJ? He's improved from last year, particularly as a playmaker. Sterling Brown is having a career year. Jae'sean Tate and Kenyon Martin have shown promise. Christian Wood has made the leap to full time starter. Only player that has flopped is Daniel House."
Dude gets in 2 major incidents in a few years. Maybe Sterling is the problem. He was an asshole to cops and got tased. He was an asshole to a regular group of guys and got cut up. We’re those guys racist too? Or is Sterling Brown just a punk?
"Small note, but he was offered 400k previously, this is almost double that. [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/sterling-brown-lawsuit-revised-offer-1.5795419)"
lol cities ain't paying shit.  It's tax payers. Which is worse.  I wonder how much in taxes Sterling Brown paid while living in Milwaukee.  This is just a big ol refund
"Tax payers just paid Sterling Brown $750,000 for something a cop did."
Are you saying how the police acted with Sterling Brown was justified ?
Tilman trying to figure out how to use this to avoid paying Sterling Brown money as we speak
[https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/12/19/sterling-brown-cop-fired-racist-memes-appeals-get-his-job-back/2350325002/](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/12/19/sterling-brown-cop-fired-racist-memes-appeals-get-his-job-back/2350325002/)  &amp;#x200B;  different officer initiated the stop than the guy who tazed him... The guy still wasnt fired for the incident directly... he was fired because his insensitive comments on facebook make him an unreliable witness for future cases.. small small silver lining. Still shitty.
"You're right, all those 4 million Wisconsin adults who had to pay $0.18 in taxes each for there to be some justice in the world for Sterling Brown may never financially recover from the blow."
"An important point to remember here is that, just like Masai Ujiri, Sterling Brown only got justice because he was rich enough to hire lawyers to fight a plainly obvious case of police brutality for three years. We never hear about 99% of these cases because the victims are too poor to do anything about it."
"The Rockets aren’t taking, they just stink and the few good players they have (Wood, Gordon, House) have all missed extended time. Serviceable guys like Sterling Brown, Augustin, Wall have missed time too. The injury bug has bit the Rockets bad this year."
" Sterling Brown, Pat Connaughton, Divincenzo and Brogdon...  ...The Bucks had 4 of these guys on their squad at one time!"
"yeah bridges as well, i more meant i'd sign those two with the expectation that they would evolve beyond that role. i'm signing sterling brown to be a 3&amp;D guy."
"I get it, thats the point of bird rights for any team that wants to develop talent. That was the point of using shumpert or so we thought when we gave up a 1st round for him. The idea that in nba economics its the only way, along with MLE, TPE to add talent to a capped out team.  We ignored all of those options.  Have you cited that last front office ghost contract?  ""Trevor Ariza tells @SportsRadio610 that he expected to remain with the Rockets last summer, but that changed when Rockets GM Daryl Morey told him ""that we don't think it's gonna happen"" at the beginning of the free agency process""  ""More from Ariza: ""I believe my efforts deserved a shot (to return), but it is what it is. I'm not complaining about anything.  When asked if Daryl Morey gave him a reason why the Rockets weren't bringing him back Ariza said ""He doesn't need a reason, it just didn't happen""  From the writing, both Paul/Harden and Ariza were all interested in running it back with better health.   Morey has spoken at his own conference candidly about what you mentioned that when you are at the cap, you have to get creative including with contracts just to get assets.  But for some reason once tillman became the owner he ignored all the very assets he spoke about and worked to get along with the TPE, the picks, the bird rights.       As I mentioned, if you look at actual incentive. None of the moves gave our manager any cap flexiblity or future flexiblity, none of the moves benefits HArden,coach, or our city. The type of savings we had and assets we lost only went to the pockets of the owner.  Morey has his faults, no doubt about it. But all the signs above and the moves and change in how we go about things changed with tillman. Theres a reason Morey tried to cet cp3, harden, Tad brown and harden cited morey and each other as people they trusted and were apart of they left.  I've had a hard time understanding how people try to spread the blame when there are actual quotes about tilman's interference and lies.    I'm not ""anti-tillman"" despite me providing simple evidence of him being the reason the rockets went from a contender with at least a generational talent who wanted to stay to the laughing stock of the league, I hope he does well. Hell I wish he did well the first time around. Last person anyone on here wants to discuss is the owner. But his mandate is the reason in 3 short years his best case scenerio is an argument at the bottom of the barrel between him, Sarver, and Donald STerling as the worst owners. He has similar personality and meddling flaws as the infamous Dolan, but he at least will spend. Owners aren't required to do much else, let alone plaster himself all over toyota center.  ITs an embarassment for houston when instead he should've made his splash and not worried about oen year of an ariza payment, a premium just to run it back, then he can save after or as he is now. rebuild and punt and get his finances in order for whenever the next run is.  Suns just got back in the playoffs after 11  years and nyc is finally finding relevancy after years of being an embarssment. Terrible ownership direction can ruin it for the fans."
theres no guarantee kpj works out here. seems like he's attracted to chaos considering he was very active in the sterling brown situation recently.  Also I don't think he thrives next to other ball dominant guys. He wasn't doing this next to wall and wouldn't do it next to sexton/garland imo.   That being said i'm glad he's taking advantage of his opportunity here and i'm hard af.
I'd take Sterling Brown.  He's TV actor attractive
Sterling Brown is the guy who settled with the Milwaukee PD correct?

Shouldn’t sterling brown be getting fined too
Who Sterling Brown lol?
"I saw this swiss cheese level defense play out a million of times before the city admitted the cop was way out of line in this incident so can you skip the next few dog whistles and just go ahead and drop the ""Well he had to confront Sterling Brown in this situation because it's a dangerous neighborhood with drug dealers and he was black with a nice car."""
"This is an incredibly dumb comment. Did you watch the video of him in Milwaukee? He was extremely polite to the police officer that came up to him, and mentioned that he kept reflexively putting his hand in his pockets because he hadn’t expected to be pulled over, it was late at night and very cold and he didn’t have a jacket.   He repeatedly apologized and asked the police officer to give him a ticket so he could be on his way, and the officer insisted on bringing backup who then insisted on shoving brown to the ground and handcuffing him. There was no way to avoid that, Sterling did everything completely right. This is some real victim blaming bullshit when there’s full video of what happened."

"i was thinking sterling brown lol, good looks"
"Lmao. Sticking your head in the sand won’t change video evidence.   “What’s your name? What’s your name?”  “Sterling, Sterling Brown.”  “I’m asking you.”  “I’m telling you. Sterling Brown”  “These are simple questions man”  “And I’m answering”  Direct quotes from the video. Nothing I said was a lie. You can continue to disregard the very link you yourself posted, but it makes you look like quite an idiot."
"Got it.  Sorry, I forgot there can only be one prevailing opinion on what may or may not have happened.  Good work policing the comments to make sure we all agree that Sterling Brown is 100% at fault, and there's no possiblity that anything else contrary to may have happened."
Did I say I know what happened?  I'm just throwing out scenarios.  You act like I have some sort of vested interest in this.  I don't.  Sterling Brown does nothing for my team but eat up minutes unt next season.  He could be cut from the team over this and it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever.   Like I said... If we're being *generous* to Sterling that may have happened.  Just trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  In all likelihood he was drunk and talking shit and other guys were drunk and talking shit.
"The only person being the asshole was the cop.  “What’s your name?”  “Sterling, Sterling Brown”  Then the cop goes off on him for being ‘tough’ when he answered his question"
"Yeah, if we're being generous to Sterling, it's entirely possible that these guys were just jealous/annoyed that they planned a party bus strip club night only to show up and find all of the girls are draped all over NBA players all night.   Then Brown jumps on the wrong bus and pisses them off further.  Ultimately, it's hard to imagine women weren't involved in some way.  That's what drunk guys usually fight over in my experience."
"&gt;*Some Rockets players had started filing out of the Booby Trap strip club prior to the incident, but a couple of them who remained — including the team’s talented young guard Kevin Porter Jr. — also stepped into the altercation as a way to protect Brown and remove him from the situation, according to sources. Porter was also roughed up a bit by the individuals, those sources said, but was fine and played Monday night against the Heat (18 points, three assists, 31 minutes).*  I feel bad for Sterling, but I'm disappointed that he and the other players seemingly played around with COVID protocol to look at T&amp;A, and even more saddened they did this with KPJ, who seems to be trying to get his life on track. ^((I know KPJ is grown, but older players can shape the behavior of young players.)) I wouldn't be surprised if the FO and/or league wants to hand out 1-game suspensions to everyone who went to that jiggle joint, but can't b/c they wouldn't have the minimum amt of players for that game."
I’m not sure if somebody bottled sterling brown because they thought he was rich I don’t quite follow that logic
"Not sure if you are wearing blue tinted glasses but this news report clearly shows Brown was calm all the time while being accused of a bunch of lies in the report.  https://youtu.be/YvX66DoKRdU  He was not ego matching, he was being lied on and was being trapped by a LOT of cops in the middle of the night. He was correcting the cop in front of his buddys and we know how this goes.  The whole report AND what the cop is saying about Sterling is disproved by the body cam.   Last, the reasons he kept his hands in his pocket was because it was cold and in the extended bodycam footage, the extra cops kept trying to open the passenger doors to his car which triggered the alarm about 5 times and at this point, him reaching suddenly became the reason to fear for safety and to grab and tackle him.   I seriously don't know why of all cases this one would make someone think Brown calling out the cop's lie should be seen as being a lack of respect or being confrontational. People are wrong at times and this cop was delusional.  He stood his ground to not end up with the charges they made up on him anyway and is the reason he tried to make an exemple out of it.   Now if I really want to tell it like it is, that cop saw a Benz parked all crooked and wanted to see if it was a senior or a "" thug"" who owns it.   When he  rushed to block the door and realised he was dealing with a Giant, he tried to claim personal space (between a man and his car of all places) and called for backup. The backups wanted to breach his car and they did only to find out he is a legit Millionnaire for their billions dollar basketball team(you can even hear them trying to undermine the fact they know this will get them in trouble). I have to look up why thise who made the report were not brought up for perjury."
Sterling Brown has done a lot of losing imo
Yes but imprisoning or shooting people who might commit any crime is a bullshit tactic. Police make bogus charges and harass anyone they feel might cause trouble. This is a thread on a former Bucks player sterling brown who was a victim of being on the wrong side of town in Milwaukee as a black man. Our country still has a lot of segregation so the over the top police patrols the white areas then the black neighborhoods still have high crime rate but nobody cares about black victims. That is why we are at this point in our society where we have rioting and protesting all over. There is still crime being committed against the most vulnerable in society and injustices by the state. For those in your cozy suburbs or gentrified urban areas don’t care.
"Yeah isn’t Sterling Brown basically on one knee right now? If you’re basically crippled it doesn’t matter how big you are, someone comes at your hard enough, you’re gonna lose."
"He parked in a handicapped spot while popping into a Walgreens at like 2 AM (may have also been double-parked -- he truly was parking like an asshole). Cop saw it happen and approached after Sterling came out of the store.  Before long it becomes clear that the cop doesn't want to just write the ticket and be on with it. Wants to make this interaction his whole night. Calls in for a backup car.  Instead of ONE backup unit arriving, every damn cop car in Milwaukee shows up at the parking lot. After 4 or so additional cop cars have arrived, original cop (to his credit) tells them ""hey, I really only needed one unit"". But since they apparently don't have anything better to do, they all stick around.   So we end up with like 6 - 8 cops in a semi-circle around Brown, interrogating him about...I don't even know what. Maybe they asked to look in the car and he said ""No"", I don't recall. 15 or so minutes in he puts his hands in his sweatshirt pocket (It's 2AM, winter in Wisconsin - his hands are cold) and so they tase and arrest him."
explains the assaults of Sterling Brown and Thabo Sefolosha
"That was Thabo Sefolosha on the Hawks a while ago, Sterling Brown was “only” tased and arrested by the cops"
"Not for nothing, but Sterling Brown seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time often. Wishing him the best."
Who is Sterling Brown hanging around to keep getting into these situations?
"[Houston Rockets statement: “Last night, Sterling Brown was the victim of an assault. He had no prior knowledge of or interaction with the assailants. He suffered facial lacerations but will make a full recovery. Sterling is not playing tonight because of his prior knee injury.](https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1384269967541956616?s=21)"
"I'm perfectly fine with the league and players taking a stand on issues that directly impact their community. You have a league which is 74% black, who all have their own stories and experiences with the police. They are looked upon as leaders in their community, whether it's where they grew up or the city of their team. They have family and friends who aren't famous and deal with these issues on the daily. Some players might even be more like Sterling Brown, Thabo Sefolosha, or Stephen Jackson then we know.   Some people won't want to watch and just call it some fake ""woke politics"" and that's fine. To the players it's real."
"He's got the sterling brown hero ball tendency, and it can be a little tough to watch. Much better scorer than sterling thoug   Feels the need to prove himself every time out there for more minutes"
What a bad mindset to have to think money can wash away the fear instilled by systemic racism. Ask Thabo sefolosha and Sterling Brown how being a millionaire ended police brutality in their life.  They are far more important things in life than basketball and money.
I’m sure Sterling Brown disagrees.
"Heat of the moment, it's actually pretty easy to do, Especially since some NBA refs are former NBA players.   It's the reason why they have a rule that players have to put warmups on when sitting on the bench. One time Sterling Brown was standing in the bench area with his warmup t-shirt off and someone mistakenly threw him the ball."
"Sterling ""Michael Jordan"" Brown!"
MVP for the Bucks tonight Sterling Brown.🤦🏾‍♂️
Sterling Brown the MVP for the Bucks tonight.
Sterling Brown is a joke!
Sterling Brown just cost the Nets the game. Dude has been awful the entire 4th quarter.🤦🏾‍♂️
Sterling brown getting layups of brook lopez is just brutal to watch
Did you have the same emotional reaction when the police broke Thabo Sefolosha's leg for no reason? Or when they tased and beat Sterling Brown? These issues are personal for many NBA players and their fans.
Sterling brown
"That's really all this is about for you. Name calling, ganging up, trying to force an innocent stranger to ""take the L?"" Why?   It's sociopathic group power dynamic wielding shit.

"Hey Philly didn't your racist cops BOMB a black neighborhood?  Hey Milwaukee didn't your racist cops assault Sterling Brown?  Maybe chill on the racist city ""jokes"" guys"
"tbh it doesn't even really matter, even the way brooks tweeted it is correct - black players in all sports are treated as entertainment, and they only enjoy their status in that context. that's why they get assaulted by cops like anyone else (thabo sefolosha), profiled by cops (sterling brown), turned away from restaurants until someone realises who they are (dominique wilkins).  none of this will ever happen to gordon hayward or alex caruso or jj redick."
Are.. are you thinking about bruce brown? Sterling Brown isnt even in this conference
thats bruce brown bro. sterling brown is on the rockets
Sterling Brown is on the Rockets my man
"George Hill was underrated on that team. He was a solid defender and if we needed a basket he almost always came through.  Jrue is a big part of the transformation but the Bucks upgrading their entire bench isn't talked about enough. This isn't the same team as last year, Only the core players remained. 4 players from last years team played yesterday.  **Players on the bubble team that are not in Milwaukee this time around**.  Eric Bledsoe • George Hill • Wesley Matthews • Marvin Williams • Kyle Korver • Frank Mason • Robin Lopez • Sterling Brown • Ersan Ilyasova • DJ Wilson"
"i am not versed in law but I have heard of multiple cases where civilians filed lawsuits against police officers and were awarded with money (coming obviously from taxpayers) at the end of it all. since we are in an nba sub, take Sterling Brown for example, where it was settled out of court.I didn't mention types of lawsuits since I have no clue. But it doesn't have to be civil lawsuits."
"""one of the only cities"" where players talk about racism?!  Pointing out that the **NYPD BEAT AND ASSAULTED THABO SEFOLOSHA IN NEW YORK CITY** wasn't whataboutism! Does that count as one of the only cities?  WAKE UP, and recall that the **Milwaukee Police BEAT AND ASSAULTED STERLING BROWN!** How many cities are you excusing here?  Get a clue dude.  You don't know that in the past decade, Boston reoriented law enforcement and made an extremely comprehensive rebuild of their policing strategies; meanwhile, in the same time frame, NY + Milwaukee are literally BEATING AND ASSAULTING NBA PLAYERS UNDER THE COLOR OF LAW.  Stop the ""only 2 cities"" bullshit about Boston &amp; Utah.  This pile-on to Boston having ignorant meanies who say bad words is ridiculous in contrast to the extreme **RACISM ENCODED IN LAW** against Hispanics across New Mexico, YOUR STATE Arizona, and potentially Southern California.  Your Suns play in what might be the epicenter of law-enforced racism in the country. Wanna talk about the border?  A drunk, ignorant lady yelling racial slur at Marcus Smart, is not the same as YOUR BOY Joe Arapaio literally being an extreme racist + international terrorist freed by your racist president from NY."
"KPJ missed 1 week of games because of this.

The NBA's health and safety protocols limit where players can go while on the road."
Didn’t KPJ and Sterling Brown get in trouble for this
Haha yeah Sterling brown is basically tupac.  Parking in a handicap spot at 2am in the middle of a Wisconsin winter....that's gangster.    Are you actually racist in real life or do you get it out of your system online where you're safe and anonymous?
1. Wood 2. KPJ 3. Tate 4. KJ Martin 5. Khyri Thomas 6. Armoni Brooks 7. Sterling Brown 8. Kelly Olynyk
"I agree the game plan shouldn't be ""close with Thanasis on Jimmy,"" and I agree that coaching may be a bit of a question (less so than most people though... I think the impact of coaching in the NBA is overrated by a lot of people). But that's where I think a smart coaching adjustment would be to use Thanasis in the right situation.   I don't like the revolving carousel of shooters off the bench that we've had going back to like... Mirza Teletovic... especially once we got to the Bud era. On paper, we have had pretty good depth most seasons, but a lot of that depth has been largely interchangeable and the rotations at times have seemed a lot like we're just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Which is fine for managing starters' minutes and keeping everybody on the roster somewhat engaged and happy, but I think it's super hard to find your rhythm when the playoffs come and bench minutes get squeezed.  With just making up numbers right now.. it was like we had 20 bench wing minutes to give last season, and rather than giving 10 to Sterling Brown and 10 to Pat each night, we'd do 20 for Pat where Sterling gets the night off, and then flipflop the next game. For guys off the bench (shooters especially), it probably does make it easier to find their rhythm from night to night... but it doesn't help prepare them for the playoffs when those 20 total minutes get reduced to 10 (ok so Sterling might get the easy adjustment in my hypothetical of just a DNP each night, but Pat has to come in and figure out a balance between making an impact and just Tony Snelling it for his small run out there). It would have been nice to just give each guy the 10 each night to prepare them for what it's gonna be like finding their rhythm in the playoffs.  I was worried that this year we were again headed down that path of night-to-night roster changes, with no endgame or plan in sight for the playoffs, but luckily we cut loose Torry Craig (who I don't think is that bad... he just never got a chance to really prove himself or gel with the roster) and overall reduced our depth a little with some of the offseason moves  But the reason I went off on this super long tangent is because I think Thanasis is the perfect guy to get his minutes yanked around. He's not coming in hoping to splash some 3's (where if he goes 0/2 on his first couple, he turns into a pumpkin out there as do a lot of bench shooters, or where if nobody passes to him in the first place, he's a pumpkin the whole time). He's coming in to provide defensive hustle which doesn't rely on others getting him involved. Not to mention that our team doesn't have much trouble scoring (outside of clutch situations at times, but even that is more narrative than backed by stats that I've seen), so why not trade a little bench offense for bench defense if the situation calls for it?"
"There were actually a lot of injuries. Multiple times they had injured players suit up but not play just to meet the minimum player requirement (8).  Off the top of my head, Oladipo, Wall, Wood, Gordon, Nwaba, Sterling Brown, House and Demarcus Cousins all had injuries that cost them at least 2 weeks   Gordon and Nwaba missed basically the entire second half. Ray Splading (G-League center) tore his achilles in his first game."
I always get Sterling and Bruce Brown confused lol
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
"That Sterling Brown incident is one of the most baffling things ever. Like when I think about the Black Lives Matter or Defund the Police movement, I think about Sterling Brown (tased by police for parking in handicap), Thabo Sefolosha (cops broke his leg outside of a nightclub, he sued and won), Jrue Holiday (handcuffed at a routine traffic stop for not having his license with him). And that's just the NBA, some of the richest and most powerful people in America. Shit's wild."
"I have actually. Look up sterling brown for me real quick oh and all the other issues with racism in milawauke. The Midwest in general, with the south isn’t great. Not saying Boston is the bastion of non racism ( it isn’t and has a long way to go, but milawauke is worse)"
We would’ve had to make sure John Henson and Sterling Brown were safe
"Van Vleet, Rose, Nunn, Tht, Roco, AD, Richaun Holmes, Sterling Brown, Iguodala, and Kaminsky are probably the 10 best from Illinois."
don’t forget sterling brown got tasered by police very recently too
Also the Sterling Brown police incident in 2018. I can see why a black man who lived there in the 70s wouldn't be fond of Milwaukee.
"Oh yeah, for sure, the police force sucks and there’s definitely a ton of racism in the northern suburbs especially. You’re probably referring to the Sterling Brown taser incident, which was heinous. A few years before that, Larry Sanders got accosted outside of a jewelry store in the rich northern suburb.  I’m just talking about the segregation issue specifically. People cite it all the time without really understanding the dynamics of the city. Not that they shouldn’t cite it, as it is a huge knock on the city, but they misuse or misunderstand it I guess?   If you’re, say, a POC moving to the city for an advertising or finance or tech job or something like that (or even a blue-collar job), you are likely never going to step foot in the segregated areas that everyone talks about. You’re not going to be looking there for housing, and no sociopolitical or economic forces will push you there.   The segregation has a material effect on outcomes for POC growing up in Milwaukee and is a marker of generational structural racism and economic disenfranchisement. But I’d go so far as it say that it’s effectively a non-factor for someone moving to the city."
"Milwaukee took that, apologized, and learnt from it by reforming their PD because people there don’t think that the sterling brown situation was good.   New Yorkers see black people killed and maimed by police officers and think ,” I like this and want more”.  Their police department reflects their backwards views, which is why NYPD refused to apologize (after being successfully sued for 4 million dollars), releasing this statement:  This settlement is not a concession that Mr. Sefolosha was blameless in this matter and there was  **no admission of liability by the defendants** ,"" the city Law Department said in a statement, ""but in light of the gravity of his injuries, the potential impact on his career as a professional athlete and the challenge for a jury in sorting out the facts in this incident, the resolution of the case was in the best interests of the City  That’s why New Yorkers supported a stop and frisk guy for mayor like a week ago."
We now know it was [Sterling Brown](https://youtu.be/YvX66DoKRdU)
"(*googles*)...ah yes, thank you.  Henson and Sterling Brown and mixing the two together."
Sterling Brown got fucked up by the police for parking in a handicapped spot at 3 am.  When that happens to a white player we'll start talking about equality.
I miss the sterling brown dj Wilson minutes
"Nah we just watched him sit our 6th man for an entire half to play rookie Sterling Brown instead because (in his own words) he saw Sterling on the bench first, we watched him instruct Middleton to miss a FT on purpose while up 3 with 1 second left in a game, we watched our defence go from below average to literally the best in the league in one offseason without him with the only personnel change of note being known defensive juggernaut Brook Lopez.  It became Reddit gospel that Kidd is a bad coach because ‘somebody said something’ in the same way that it became Reddit gospel that Anthony Bennett was a draft bust because ‘somebody said something’."
If you ask Henson and Sterling Brown... BLM.  It's a joke!
"I aint even going to lie,I still don't look at Milwaukee the same way after the Sterling Brown incident"
Yo another thread about Milwaukee and not one mention of sterling brown and Milwaukee PD being assfaces.
Sterling brown def got something to say about the city. John Henson probably too
"Throwback to John Henson getting the cops called on him at a jewelry store because he was black, oh and sterling brown getting tased because he was also black."
"Remember when a jewelry store called the cops on John Henson because he was… black.    Remember when sterling brown got beat up and tasted by cops because u guessed it.. he was black.    Milwaukee is a very racist city, not surprised when PoC Call it shitty."
"And the Bucks sat everyone for the Denver game right before the shut down. They started Wes Mathews, Pat Connaughton, Sterling Brown, Thanasis, and Robin Lopez 🤮"
"Nope   A team over the cap with a core of Wall, Wood and Ben. And a supporting cast of Tate, Nwaba, EG, Cousins, PJ, Sterling Brown  We don’t have our picks after next year and that’s a perennial 12th seed. And we’d be paying the tax to suck ass. Probably will need to give away more picks to get rid of Wall so we can try and make the playoffs with a better fit next to Ben. Would be a disaster   I’ll take the 8 picks and 50m off the books. We have cap space now to sign someone and can roll the dice on some prospects while waiting for the draft or just use the picks and trade for someone"
"Lol he was scoring in giannis in game 6, he was clearly not himself this series but keep trying to hate on an injured player. They always use sterling brown as the screener and giannis just switched it, he didn’t give a fuck about that “beef”, stop making shit up"
"""prime time"" Sterling Brown is his name."
"We got Reggie Bullock, Sterling brown and re signed Timmy to four years. It ain’t much but I think we’ll be about as good as last year unless KP can show up for real"
"Luka (duh), Brunson, Hardaway, Finney-Smith, Willie Cauley-Stein surprisingly, and Sterling Brown if he continues what he did in Houston  I would put Kleber on here if it wasn’t for covid and nagging injury issues affecting his defense last season, because his shooting was the best it’s ever been."
"Luka, KP, Tim Jr  Plus+ Sterling Brown, Bullock, &amp; co."
Nah nah y’all got the goat sterling brown trust me that dude is a fkn stud
"&gt;	Why does no one seem to care that the Mavericks seem to primarily go after caucasian players?   Because its not true. Our targets this offseason have been Lowry, Bullock, Sterling Brown, Bobby Portis, and Batum. Dragic and Markkanen are our back up plans."
"Excuse me, they also signed Sterling Brown"
"The Mavs don’t have a CP3 to run their offense when Luka is on the bench. Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown are good signings, but that doesn’t move the needle enough for them to get anywhere close to the 2018 Rockets."
"The bench unit would be quite nice. Especially if we could pull out also the Dragic trade. Dragic, Brunson, Sterling Brown, Markkanen, Kleber. Literally three players that can easily score 15+ points, plus two elite 3point shooters."
"As a Dallas fan I hope Lauri doesn’t stay with you and comes to us. Our potential bench unit squad would be: Dragic (i have a good feeling that he’s coming), Brunson, Sterling Brown, Markkanen, Kleber.  3 guys which could easily score 15+ points, plus Brown and Kleber as elite 3 point shooters/decent defenders. We also got Moses Brown in the Richardson trade (maybe he could also become a solid bench unit option)."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Ok, then mediocre.   Don't Luka and KP still hate each other? What moves have the Mavs made other than 2 bench players Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown?  They are running out of decent FA's and only have a limited number of tradeable assets."
"Sterling Brown was a nice pickup. He can shoot, plays decent D, and doesn't make a ton of mistakes. He'll be good off the bench."
Sterling Brown can do that too. The Curry-Richardson trade was seen as a [win-win] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jwvqx8/wojnarowski_dallas_is_acquiring_philadelphias/) last year. Brown and Bullock are more like solid bench pieces that could shoot themselves out of a playoff team's rotation. Coaching got much worse.  At best those were lateral moves. Cuban claiming they improved considerably makes him look delusional af. Luka improving and Porzingis finally playing like an all-star would be their best chance of taking the next step.
The only way we can improve considerably (Reggie and Sterling Brown were really good signings but of course they only move the needle a little tiny bit) is if Kristaps utilizes his first healthy offseason in years.  Our future is tied to Kristaps performing well this year (and meshing with Luka or bringing his trade value up to get Luka a different #2)
So they added Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown and “improved considerably”?
"sterling brown, got THJ and Boban back"
"Problem is, not every team has a line of former All-Stars begging to play for them on a vet min. Lowry was off as soon as the magnificent city of Miami blessed him with the honor of living there. DeRozan was a huge overpay from the Bulls. A similar offer to us would be Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell. ""Oh, but those players are replaceable, role players, yadayada"". If you see our rotations in the Clippers series, you will see that we had to give significant minutes to Nicollo Melli, currently on a non-Euroleague team. If you see the games, you will notice how half of our possessions were wasted with Melli or a gassed DFS bricking a corner 3.  We brought defenders. We have now a rotation of wings that can switch 1-4 AND can handle their own on open shots. We could've paid DeRozan, yes, at the expense of THJ, but we could. We wouldn't, however, have any defensive depth on the wings. We would require again vet min contracts, and, unlike the almighty Los Angeles Lakers, the players that considers the vet min for us are *slightly* worse than Nunn and Monk.   Dinwiddie probably wanted to be a clear cut starting PG, considering his plan B was the Pelicans. Lonzo could've been attainable with the right price. Chicago's offer was better than the one that we could offer, but maybe we could've convinced Lonzo to force a move here. Maybe we did, but it did not work. Norman Powell signed on a steal for Portland, cheaper than THJ on production, but, again, the difference isn't that big.   Nico did what he could. He did not hinder the team going for the fences in a nutjob trade for a #2, he did not sit and waited for the Kawhi's pseudo tour while allowing every FA to walk. He took a position of deep need, signed 2 market-friendly contracts in THJ and Bullock and a steal in Sterling Brown. We still have the TPE that we can use to either add a passer (I want us to talk with the Pels for Sato) or a prolific offensive option (maybe Markkanen will accept a discount to play with Luka)."
"Just returning to this thread thinking about Sterling Brown.   You guys remember him? That was fucked.  Now remember Thabo Sefolosha? That was fucked too.  Masai Ujiri even if you count that.  So if minority NBA stars and even Team Presidents get harassed by police and face this kind of behavior, what do you think happens to your average minority on the street?   Must not be very nice. I've never had to deal with anything of the sort and I'm very grateful, but it's just sad that so many of our community has to."
Maybe Court TV should bring in Sterling Brown as an analyst for this case
 -What did you do to improve the team?  -We fired Carlisle and hired Kidd.  -Rest of the coaching staff?  -His assistant coach responsible for the Bucks' terrible defense and more players from the 2011 team. Our new GM is really popular among superstars and helped us sign Rockets legend Sterling Brown.  -Trade me
lol bullock and sterling brown. Brown is a backup
We got Bullock and Sterling Brown. Markkanen would be good addition in terms of potential. The bigger problem of Dallas is back-up PG
"Donnie Nelson never did with the Mavs. I'm sure Nico was tampering this year though, because we heard that Sterling Brown was going to Dallas a few days early."
5/6 on Hard. Not sure why I thought Sterling Brown was on the Nets.
"IMO Colangelo did a worse job than Billy King during his mutilation of the Nets.  At least King's moves had a somewhat sound logical basis. Colangelo was a total moron selling 2nd round draft picks (he sold the rights to Sterling Brown in 2017), and using 2 first rounders to draft Fultz, one of the biggest busts of the decade. There are reports that Colangelo overrode his staff's concerns when Fultz had terrible workouts.   Also, here are a few players drafted after Pasečņiks (25):  * Kuzma (27) * Derrick White (29) * Josh Hart (30) * Wes Iwundu (33) * Dillon Brooks (45)  In summary, fuck the Colangelos."
so do you think the girlfriend was beating him? did a neighbor call it?   why would the police want to talk to her alone and why wouldn’t he let them?   why didn’t he stop resisting like Sterling Brown did?    and he got benched this year bc he was awful and had a bad attitude    it’s a totally rational leap to think a young man was beating his girlfriend. those police officers could be the only thing saving her from being raped/assaulted   you have no idea what’s going on either
Sefolosha got his leg broken. Sterling Brown got slammed to the pavement over a parking violation. Yet a bunch of people here are giving the LAPD the benefit of the doubt.
"Randy bullock from the Knicks. 42% from 3 on 6 (or 8?) attempts a game while cursing toughest assignment 1-3. And Sterling Brown, a bench piece but brings good defense and 45% from 3 on 2 per game. Our sub is pessimistic because we didn’t get a bonafide superstar but it’s been a pretty good offseason for us. And we are hoping to get Dragic/Dennis/another ball handler with our 12 million TPE"
"Similar situation with sterling brown, think he only got $800k.   Which, obviously, life changing sum for anyone in this sub. But probably not worth it for someone of his net worth."
Go tell that to Jaxson Hayes or Sterling Brown
"Video evidence or testimony in front of a judge? This video seems pretty much spot on in that point, Jaxson is already being held down, why does he need to be tased? His friend is recording the police, perfectly legal, and they come after him too?  Sterling Brown video he’s parked illegally, and the cop waits for him to come out of a restaurant and then calls in a bunch of backup, for a parking ticket? What? Why couldn’t he just put the ticket on the windshield and be done with it?  In the Thabo Sefolosha video there are plenty of witnesses and he sued the NYPD, he clearly didn’t escalate anything to violence like the police tried to claim he did.  As for violent encounters between NBA players and police, are there really any others? Not that I can recall off the top of my head."
Sterling Brown too
Clearly the Mavs. We got Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock. ::sobs into pillow::
"You should have gotten him. Mavs now have both Sterling and Moses Brown, while Nuggets have both JMyke and Jeff Green. Confusing last names are all the rage in the Western Conference this year!"
Easier rule of thumb:   Always assume cops are lying.   Incidents of police smearing credibility on initial reports just in the nba in the last decade:  Thabo Sefolosha  Sterling brown  Massai Ujiri  Jaxson Hayes   This shit is ridiculous.

Sterling Brown
Mavs gonna call this summer success after signing Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown. I'm having a meltdown
not gonna lie i thought bruce brown was the one who got signed earlier. it was sterling brown. lol
They plan to go over the cap to get the MLE to use on Bullock and Sterling Brown. So they have about $15m to get over the cap
Just the fact that you see a THJ resign and S brown signing as anything above ok proves my point. We missed on several players in the past and didnt get better as a team. That's what im talking about.  We dont get big FA's here. We miss.    Happy to have THJ back. Sterling Brown is nothing noteworthy. We did not address our needs from last year.
We got Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock! Let's go MAVS!
"Even then there's no way sterling brown averages more than 5 3s a game, he's gonna come off the bench mainly to defend and shoot some open threes,"
"I mean we knew about Sterling Brown and Boban for a while, but yeah had no idea Bullock was even a possibility and definitely wasn't thinking THJ was gonna be a first minute of free agency signing"
Oh no not Sterling Brown!
Bullock and Sterling Brown are solid defenders too.  W move
The dominos will start to fall once Sterling Brown has signed
"Why?? Sterling Brown is a perfect bench guy for most teams. Shoots it well, plays good defense at an important position, and will most likely come cheap. There is nothing wrong with adding good depth."
Downtown Sterling Brown baby!
sterling brown is pretty good last I checked. Good on Dallas!
OPJ MLE + Caruso + Sterling Brown
"It doesn’t even hurt anymore at this point, but that’s because as a Mavs fan you learn not to be excited.   Time to watch Sterling Brown and Dennis Schröder highlights, I guess…"
Our biggest signing today along with Sterling Brown.
Sterling Brown will
Sterling Brown would like a word
Then Miami loses all their draft picks until 2040 and is forced to trade Jimmy Butler and Bam to the Rockets for Sterling Brown
"It’s not about age, it’s about ability. You can be 150 years old, but if you’re not washed, you’re not washed. Langston Galloway, Sterling Brown, Wayne Ellington are all better options than Melo, Iggy, and Dwight."
"I have a hot take: After being named as the front runners for Sterling Brown, the Dallas Mavericks still aren’t able to sign him."
Idk why but Sterling Brown has always been one of my favorite rotation guys. I really really want him to succeed.
Nah Sterling Brown is much better
"sterling brown is a little more stout on defense, no? and worse as a shooter? i don't think they're very much alike at all outside of the lack of ball movement lol"
He's a better version of sterling brown.   Has absolutely no clue what passing is
What are yoy talking about? They are the frontrunners to land Sterling Brown!
Tbh I saw “Sterling Brown” and just assumed it was a GM or coach for some reason.
"i mean while you’re not wrong, Sterling Brown has always been the level of player we get in free agency lol"
"""Looks like the Mavs' free agency luck is finally turning around now that Nico Harrison is at the helm as GM.""  &amp;#x200B;  I mean....it's Sterling Brown bruh. I wouldn't say this is an indication of anything in terms of front office competence."
"&gt;Nico is already morphing the Mavs into a prime destination for the most coveted free agents.    wat? WTF is Sterling Brown.   So far everyone we signed, I have never heard of before in my life."
"Everyone's a comedian on this sub, but Sterling Brown was a fantastic shooter for the Rockets last year and would be a great addition for the Mavs on a cheap deal."
You sure? Because I have it on good authority Sterling Brown will most likely not sign with the Seattle SuperSonics.
"Sterling Brown and Jason Kidd re-united, I guess. He might get some good minutes if Luka steps out of line"
Who is Sterling Brown?
TIL [Sterling Brown](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownst02.html) is brothers with [Shannon Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6c3wibswBQ)
Sterling Brown sweepstakes has begun..
I like Sterling Brown. Decent signing for the Mavs. bet he provides more value than Richardson did.
The article implies that Miami and New Orleans are ahead of the pecking order since Lowry has a good relationship with Butler and New Orleans can make the biggest offer.   But it's encouraging that the Mavs have the upper hand in the Sterling Brown sweepstakes. Close the deal Nico!
this is 100% true bc nobody is making up Sterling Brown free agency rumors
"Except Sterling Brown, poor guy."
Sterling brown disagrees
"&gt;If he actually tried to get in the house when instructed not to so he could potentially intimidate the victim that'd be awful.   There's no mention anywhere that he was trying to intimidate anyone. The only mention of a woman at all is that a woman was present who didn't want to help with their investigation, but I guess it's ok to jump to the conclusion that Hayes was abusing her?   If Hayes was involved in domestic violence he would have been arrested for that, as police don't need a victim to press charges if they see signs of domestic abuse, they can make that call on their own. So the fact that he wasn't arrested for that makes me feel confident that the police didn't think he was abusing her. We also don't know who called the police at all, as [there have been cases where neighbors have called the cops for a noise complaint and said it was domestic abuse just to get someone to show up right away,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Ryan_Whitaker?wprov=sfla1) and since the woman didn't want to cooperate with the cops it may not have been her who called.   All I'm saying is that there is a very long history of cops abusing their power, especially with black men, and then arresting them for nothing more than resisting arrest if they aren't compliant enough. After all, Sterling Brown was also arrested for resisting arrest with no other charges. If you're asking me to give the cops the benefit of the doubt, then I'm sorry if I don't. If they want that then they can release the body cam footage, as they always do immediately whenever it makes them look good. The fact that the footage hasn't already been released along with only a charge of resisting arrest sure sets off a lot of warning bells with me."
"Obviously the report could be total bullshit like the Sterling Brown one was, but the report *does* paint Hayes as the one escalating things with trying to force his way back into the house multiple times while the cops wanted to speak to the woman alone."
"Cops showed up to his place around 3am for a domestic incident. He ended up getting tased and hospitalized. A cop also went to the hospital, he has been charged with felony assualt of a cop.   There are some speculations as to what actually happened but very little details.  Some neighbors heard enough screaming to wake them up at 3am and it's not like this neighborhood has houses stacked on top of each other so it was loud. But I can't tell if it happened before or after the first cops arrived and it seems the neighbors didn't know either.  One neighbor heard the girlfriend scream, ""don't turn him over.""   It's all very confusing and little is known right now. It could be something or it could be a Sterling Brown, Thabo Sefolosha, Masai type incident.   https://www.nola.com/sports/pelicans/article_a4bcea62-eff1-11eb-a766-5f13726c03e5.html"
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"
Him and Sterling Brown are in some kind of exclusive club. The only players in the NBA that got tazed by the cops
"Rebuild to a contending status yeah but I doubt we’ll be thaaaaat bad for too long   We basically played 60% of our games with almost an entire roster of g league guys   Depends who we bring back this year but KPJ, KJ, Wall, Wood, Green, Nwaba, Sterling Brown, EG, Olynk should definitely be better than a lot of these terrible teams, assuming we’re at least slightly healthy this year"
.... Sterling brown? /s 🤣🤣🤣
"""Domestic Incident"" is literally any call to a home. It doesn't need to be domestic abuse, it could have been a noise complaint or a complaint of underage drinking or literally anything.  This just reeks of Sterling Brown. Some cops think a Black man isn't showing them the proper respect so they ""put him in his place.""  Police, **especially**, LAPD(and, hell, Milwaukee PD) should not be getting the benefit of the doubt anymore."
Really?  Was it that serious?  Similar things happened to Sterling Brown and he was fine.
"Seriously.  Remember when sterling brown got tasered and they said he ""attacked the cops"".   Shit, remember they tried to lie about what Masai did WHEN THEY HAD LIKE 1000 CAMERAS ON"
"Imma wait for the full story to come out before making any judgements. After Thabo Sefelosha, Sterling Brown and Masai Ujiri (and literally dozens of non-NBA individuals), the cops have earned zero benefit of the doubt. Body cams or fuck off."
Yeah but i honestly thought people got smarter in the last 5 years......even with the Sterling Brown stuff you would think NBA fans would be a hint smarter.
"And the cops who assaulted Sterling Brown and the ones who assaulted Thabo Sefolosha and the one who murdered Philando Castille and the ones who participated in the murder of George Floyd and huh, there seems to be a pattern here."
"are you a black man? serious question, because if you look at the cases of Sterling Brown, Thabo Sefolosha, etc your point is not actually true. You may be lacking a bit of perspective here. Not all rich people are treated alike by the police."
Sterling Brown and Masai Ujiri incidents aged like milk here
Absolutely. I’m trying to quell all the initial posts here saying Hayes is a piece of garbage.  Maybe he is. But we don’t know what actually happened yet. We have recent incidents involving Masai Ujiri (officer also claimed to get hurt) and Sterling Brown that should be enough for people to wait for more information.
Most notably Sterling Brown and Thabo Sefolosha
"Uh dipshit, you obviously have never had an actual friend that was black, otherwise you'd have heard about getting pulled over for a DWB. Driving while black. Black man, nice car, he's définitely getting stopped, shit look at Sterling Brown and there's no fucking way Wisconsin is considered more racist than Texas. Just because you don't hear about doesn't mean it doesn't happen all the fucking time; when a cop stops a rich black man, someone who can defend themself, no one wants that shit getting out, neither the team nor the city.  Honestly, your comment drives me fucking crazy. All of them, every one of those potential free agents, they damn sure think about this shit. Just mind bogglingly oblivious to what life is actually like in Dallas for anyone with a perspective different from your own. Barely 20 years ago in Texas, some good ole boys dragged a black man behind a pickup truck by a chain until he broke in two. If you don't think that kind of shit becomes possible because of pervasive, endemic racism, then you need to go fucking learn something. You talkin bout fucking taxes."
Downtown popcorn sterling brown
"And for his next prank on Sterling Brown, Giannis enlisted Milwaukee PD…."
"I'm gonna level, that trade would've been worth it even if we didn't get PJ back, just to get off of Augustin's awful contract. We wouldn't have won without PJ, and we'd be fucked going into next season FA. It was huge for us.  (Please take care of DJW, CWood and Sterling Brown for us, Houston)"
"STREET RULES? I'm going with the Rockets  Tate, Kenyon Jr, KPJ, Olynyk, Wood, Wall, House, Sterling Brown, &amp; DJ Wilson are not dudes you want to mess with, especially if Kenyon Sr is around."
"Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown and Moses Brown were all good signings, and Ntilikina could pan out with the right guidance too. Mavs had an under the radar offseason but really improved their depth and outside shooting."
"Some comments:  * DFS will only play at the 4 in small-ball packages. He will split time at the 3 with THJ and Bullock, probably pending on the matchup;  * I'm fairly sure Sterling Brown is ahead of Green in the chart. To be honest, the Ntilikina sign makes me wonder if we are not prepping a Green trade. He will take Burke's spot in the roster, but his role is basically Green's, except that he already polished his defense;  * Moses is the last C on the depth. WCS should be the usual KP backup, with Powell finding the court (if he's not traded) whenever the opponent fields a smaller 5. Boban will probably play selected matchups, against Embiid and other physical 5. Moses will be a victory cigar at best  In general you are right, our team will be heavily matchup based, or at least it should. We acquired a plethora of versatile and switchable defenders, but we have no idea if Kidd have become a smart cookie.  Our usual lineup will probably be Luka/Bullock/THJ/Maxi/KP, with Brunson/Green-Terry-Ntilikina/DFS/Sterling/WCS, but you will find THJ in the 2nd unit whenever we need firepower (considering we will force Brunson into a point role), or DFS with Bullock against high octane offenses, like the Nets."
no him and sterling brown walked in the wrong van outside a club and brown got attacked. if ur gonna complain ab kpj going to a club then ur just looking for anything cause mad nba players go to clubs. if ur just talking ab the “fight” then i get it but i don’t see that as issues off court it was just an unfortunate situation to me
"u act like i ignored his past problem. i literally just stated he hasn’t had any issues off the court unless u wanna count the sterling brown shit, but he’s been fine in houston and tweeted multiple times ab how happy he is in houston. obviously yes he can fuck around and do bad shit at any moment but it looks like houston has been a fresh place for him and he’s been great here"
"It's funny that you're getting downvoted because I think you're right.  Disclaimer: mavs fan from Dallas who's lived in NY for the last decade, who's a frank believer, and who also thinks dragic is good and a nearly-perfect fit with Luka as a secondary ball handler. This is not an indictment on dragic, more-so a discussion of fit and team identity.  The reality is that frankie smokes doesn't really need to fit what dragic would be for us, and that's okay. Frank needs to play decent defense and hit an open 3 (easier said than done with him, I feel you Knicks fans). That role is essentially what DFS and maxi have become. I think it's more than doable frank can do it (again Knicks fans, I know many of you are already beyond that point).  It seems like the goal with the signing is that the mavs wanna put at least 2-3 decent wing defenders on the floor at any given time. Getting cooked by PG and Kawhi two years in a row isn't sitting so well...So now we have dfs, frank, bullock, maxi, and sterling brown. All (except frank) have become serviceable 3 and D guys. If he can hit 3's at a consistent clip, frank fits right into that.   All that being said, we haven't fixed our need for a secondary ball handler, cuz frank...ain't it. In that way, the jokes are warranted.   That's what's scary here. It's like the team is planning for the best-case scenario, which is Luka being mvp-level, KP showing out consistently, and jalen Brunson becoming a true second-team facilitator. Again, that's best case. Brunson has shown he can weave and get buckets, but passing isn't his thing. So, overall, planning that way might backfire for dallas.  Doesn't seem like Toronto will buy dragic out. They don't have any reason to. So who exactly is gonna lessen Luka's burden? I don't see it yet with the current team."
Sterling Brown on the Mavs. He's was a very cheap (3 mil per year) and under the radar move that might make a push for more minutes. Same with Moses Brown
Sterling brown
There is a very good chance that Jalen Green will be a big improvement over the guys who he is replacing (Victor Oladipo and Sterling Brown)
I just now found out that Sterling Brown is his brother.
This man had crazy ass hops.   I forget all the time that Sterling Brown is his brother.
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
"Jake Fischer is one of the most plugged in guys in Dallas. Not saying it’s 100% true, but his track record is very very solid. He was the first to break the signings on both sterling brown and Reggie bullock this summer. Point is, he’s credible."
"Brunson and Sterling Brown. The Mavs bench unit is garbage. The team went from 118 points per game to 83 when Luka was off he court, and that can't keep happening. Brunson is getting better, but I need to see him stay consistent. And Sterling Brown is a new acquisition that might be thruster into bench minutes quick, if josh green can't get his shit together."
"Call me crazy but if KP can return to his form Mavs might be there.   Luka an MVP, KP an all star, Hardaway and Brunson were both in the top 5 in 6man of the year. Then u add good role players like DFS, Bullock and Kleber and u have yourself a good enough team. There is 1 more thing missing from Mavs and thats Dragic. If they get him Mavs might be a lowkey contender.  Luka, Hardaway, Bullock, DFS, KP with Dragic, Brunson, Sterling Brown, Kleber, WCS off the bench is a good team.  Hot take but save this comment."
"Why is Tim Hardaway Jr in that photo in the OP, like he's a new signing? I know he just signed an extension with the Mavs, but he's already been there for 2 1/2 seasons, and isn't a newcomer like Sterling Brown, Moses Brown, and Reggie Bullock."
"If my Mavs didn’t have like 5 guys above 6’10, he’d fit great into a back up lineup with Brunson and Sterling Brown."
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
"i’m pretty sure sterling brown was in a parking lot, Pero Antic  Cope and Thabo was at a nightclub   Hayes was at a really nice house in a rich part of town and the girls friend called 911 and said she was with jaxson hayes  plus Antic lost his case lol"
&gt; cops don’t fuck around with people who have money  Umm you really think that here on nba reddit? Do some research bruh look up Sterling Brown. Look Up Pero Antic. Look up Thabo and Chris Copeland. There are hundreds of instances of rich and famous people getting jacked up because 50 no care
"They've had comparable rosters, outside of khris Middleton on Jrue this year everyone has been a role players/journeymen   Eric bledsoe,Bryn Forbes,sterling brown, pat connaughton, brook lopez,bobby Portis,George hill and a bunch of other people who either aren't in the league or deep bench players"
I mean Sterling Brown also decided to return to play under Kidd.
Brother of the great Sterling Brown.
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
"Gotta be Frank Ntilikina, Josh Green, and Sterling Brown"
Sterling brown is averaging 10 minutes per game. I think bullock should get all of his minutes.
"The first moments of the offseason, the fan base was basically divided between Lonzo and Lowry. Then came the DeRozan hype and some small Dinwiddie steam, but at first, a good portion of the fanbase (myself included) wanted Lonzo.   I still think that what'll hinder us is having just Luka as a passer. Our 2nd unit would benefit a lot by having a willing passer to pair alongside Brunson. Kidd tried to have Sterling Brown as a secondary ball handler to Brunson in the preseason, but this is obviously a break the glass situation. We had to get Lonzo and, since it failed, we had to get Dragic at least.   We have good, switchable wing defenders, we have two good backcourt defenders, but if Kidd wants to see off-ball Luka (which is good. Off-ball Luka means the best defender on the other team won't be on on-ball defense and will be easier to be switched out), we had to go grab a 8+AST guy and rotate him, Luka and Brunson on the backcourt."
"That reminds of what the Milwaukee Police said about the Sterling Brown video.  &gt; ""There's going to be a video that's going to come out soon, in the next couple of weeks, involving the department, and I'm going to honest with you, we're going to need your support during the challenges,"""
"The sub is filled with people who thought we’re gonna tear up the league with Nerlens Noel and Sterling Brown, Kidd gonna awaken KP’s hidden potential (like he’s Gohan) and photos of Luka not looking fat from one angle and the sub thinking he’s gonna go prime mj mode on the league"
"Don't worry guys KP may still be stagnant, but we made the major off-season additions of Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown.  What a fucking joke of a franchise"
Wow turns out Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown don't move the needle at all  Luka isn't finishing his supermax on this team
"After only winning 9 of 23 games and losing our players to Covid, we went on to win 33 of the final 49 games, which is a 67% winning percentage (55 win pace season). We got rid of Josh Richardson and added two 40% 3-pt shooters in Bullock and Sterling Brown, so I'm not sure how our situation is different from Atlanta's sans being lucky in facing a putrid Randle and a hobbled Embiid."
Sterling Brown is better than both of them combined.
"Take that and add those minor moves that DO have a huge impact to our roster.  We are a seriously deeper team now with a lot more defense.  We basically replaced Nico Melli, Wes Iwundu, and the corpse of Jason Richardson, for Reggie Bullock - a solid 3 &amp; D starter for a playoff team, Sterling Brown who plays above average D and hit 42% from deep last year, and a flyer on Frank Ntilikina who hopefully can be a matchup based defender on some more elite wings when needed.  Even if KP doesn't improve, our regular season record should be much better simply because we are deeper.  KP is going to be the ceiling raiser in the playoffs."
"Same, people clowning the rankings for having the Mavs above clippers and Nuggets but the Clips are missing their MVP caliber leading scorer and the Nuggets are missing an all star caliber wing, the clippers are potentially looking at the play in and the Nuggets may be just 48-50 wins.   When healthy the Mavs last year went 33-16 and Reggie bullock and sterling brown are better than Josh richardson and James Johnson"
"Bruce Brown, Jaylen Brown, Moses Brown, Sterling Brown, Greg Brown III, Troy Brown Jr: they are all actually uh wait a second never mind, I pass, pay no heed to my flair"
"I just think that only the suns lakers warriors and jazz have a legitimate chance to out seed us. We had like the fourth best net rating in the league post all star break, and we got better with Bullock and Sterling Brown. Saying we get the 7/8th seed just doesn’t seem very likely but this is coming from a Mavs fan so grain of salt I suppose"
"Covid problems. KP injuried for 15 games or more.  Plus we added Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown. Brunson seems to be still developing. Josh Green looks more confident. Omoruyi and Carlik are good grabs in the draft. Kidd bringed our chemestry from 40% to 90% etc."
Sterling and Moses brown went hard
"We swapped out Josh Richardson, JJ Redick, and Melli for Moses Brown, Reggie Bullock, and Sterling Brown. We’re also utilizing KP far more effectively from what we’ve seen thus far."
But sterling brown and Reggie Bullock&gt;Josh richardson and James Johnson
Sterling Brown looking great
"Yeah but Brunson would get paid this season, so we could capitalize on that. THJ is a shooter yes, but we would still have Kleber, FINNEY-Smith, Bullock, Sterling Brown… we would be fine I guess (maybe the trade would include one more player from Philadelphia). Plus Kidd said, that we will try to play a bit more in the paint. I think that’s a really decent trade for both sides. I think KP for Simmons is not plausible at the moment, because Dallas will still try work it out with KP."
"Its just the preseason. ill trust Poole if he is gonna put this numbers in the regular season.  And adding and old Iggy, Nemanja and an always injuried OPJ doesnt make you a top 4 seed team.  As to Mavs improvements: KP is healthy and with an Kidd system he will look better. We also added depth with Bullock, Sterling Brown and Moses Brown. Brunson may take another step in his development. Luka might be the MVP this season. etc."
By getting twos and fts that also includes big men and cutters. So for example Dorian is a good cutter and sterling brown appears to be also getting it to a big off a PnR. There’s a tons of different ways of getting shots other than 3s and more than four people on our team can get those. Maybe those are the four that can create them but others can score by means other than shooting 3s
Move over down town sterling brown. Uptown sterling brown is here!
"Bruh we had 5 proven 38% and higher 3pt shooter in high volumes in the roster lol (THJ, Bullock, KP, Maxi, Brunson). Not counting Dodo or Sterling Brown around 37%. We fucked if Luka injured though because no one can dribble more than 3 times lol. We are just Hayward or Harrison Barnes away from contender :("
"Luka had an early season slump last season, but his bad stats from the perimeter comes more from volume than lack of efficiency. Luka was 9th in 3 pt attempts last season and the majority of those shots were tough ones: doubled, trapped, off the dribble. Only late in the season THJ became a reliable scaping valve for him and drew some attention. Of course, Simmons isn't the guy that will make him not be harassed, but if he manages to scale down his attempts (this was a topic this season, with Bullock and Sterling Brown coming to alleviate the fact that we only had 3 reliable perimeter guys in the roster last year, and all 3 had to start), we'll see some extra efficiency. THJ and Bullock are potential 40%+ guys on good volume (specially if THJ have some better looks) and DFS, Maxi and Sterling are 37-39% on decent volume, both starting and coming off the bench.   I don't think it would work, at least in the regular season, due to sheer rebounding. Luka is a great rebounder for a guard, but neither other player in this 5-out team is a good rebounder. Simmons is decent, Maxi, Bullock and THJ just are not. Without KP (and with, if we are being honest), our best rebounder is Powell (could be Moses Brown, if he develops), and starting Simmons in any package that isn't with him in the 2nd unit as PG or in the starting 5 as small ball C won't cut. Powell at the 4 would just clog the paint, but without the MVP upside of Embiid.   Again, I don't think this would happen. Kidd really likes KP and went out of his way to input confidence in him. Also, no way Morey accepts KP one-on-one. They need creators, not another spacer. Buuuut a decent coach could make this work for regular season (we would be abused in some games, but KP is already abused in those games, so, yeah) and, considering Luka can make any big unplayable in the post season, would be a deadly lineup. We can even put Maxi at PF so he can dunk instead of Simmons."
"I'll break this down a little different (which I'm sure is true to an *extent* elsewhere):  Republican's in Wisconsin *hate* basketball and the NBA. Even with the Buck's championship I don't think that has changed much.   What happened to Sterling Brown was horrible, but not surprising in the least. Not sure how much you read about that story, but the arresting officer made some absolutely horrific social media posts following the incident (which is actually what got him fired):  * “Nice meeting Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks at work this morning! LOL #FeartheDeer,” Andrade wrote on Facebook, referencing the Bucks’ rallying cry.  * After Game 1 of the NBA Finals, during which the Cleveland Cavaliers’ J.R. Smith committed a gaffe by letting the time run out when the game was tied, Andrade posted on Facebook, “I hope JR Smith double parks in Walgreens handicap parking spots when he’s in Milwaukee.”"
Is that the same cvs where the police beat up sterling brown?
"Mavs' starters will be Luka, Bullock, DFS, KP, and Powell, so that leaves the bench unit to be Brunson, THJ, Sterling Brown, Kleber, and WCS. It's not as talented as some other units but is still very solid. Aside from WCS, these players shoot 40% from 3 (THJ is 39.1%, but on higher volume)"
I mean their own PD couldn’t be bothered to know they were assaulting Sterling Brown so yeah doesn’t surprise me
Interested to see how Sterling Brown and Reggie bullock do for my Mavs
Still is. Go ask Sterling Brown.
"Our same role players (Tim Hardaway, Dorian Finney-Smith, Brunson, even KP) are all playing the same role and shooting well below their averages from the last couple seasons. It’s not like Bullock or Sterling Brown handled the ball a lot for the Knicks/Rockets either. If you ask those guys to dribble the ball, you’re in trouble. I have no explanation."
"Part of the reason is the difference is bigger this season is because the Mavs have added better defensive pieces to their bench in Frank Ntilikina, Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock. (Not big names, but great defenders statistically over their careers)  As a result the drop-off when he is on the court is much bigger, because the bench is better than it was. To give a similarish example, Cole Anthony has one of the absolute best on-offs in the entire league right now, not because he is a superstar in disguise (although he is very good) but because our bench is horrendously bad and lacks a true PG.  On-offs tell you as much about the replacement players as they do about the player themselves."
Ask Thabo Sefolosha and Sterling Brown how great America can be if you're a rich basketball player I'm sure they'll tell you.
"Giannis won back 2 back MVPs with Bledsoe, Matthews, Sterling Brown, can't-shoot-versions of Pat and Hill and Tony Snell. And he did so with the best record in the league also b2b while being all-defense 1st team every year and winning a DPOY too, AKA trying on both ends. Sit down and show some respect.  Facu and Rivers aren't even starters for the Nuggets lmao."
Moses Brown is a center. Sterling Brown is not.
Haha true that. Bill Burr has the funniest bit about malice in the palace lol highly recommend if you haven't seen it already. I forgot about sterling brown. I think he got hit over the head with a bottle too.
Lmao after those fat losers got beat up at the malice in the palace i think most ppl know not to fight Nba players. Im pretty sure Sterling brown got stabbed/ jumped tho but i wouldn’t consider that fighting someone
"I’d throw in Finney-Smith instead of Sterling Brown if that’s what it takes, but I don’t think that’s enough either. Our only other asset we could potentially send out is Jalen, but I don’t think that’s worth it since we don’t have another good bench facilitator"
"Turner will be perfect but idk if we have a good trade package to get him.   Any Pacers fan her will take 2 1st round picks, Moses Brown, Josh Green and Sterling Brown for Turner?"
Maybe Harrell?   Idk but they need an upgrade at that spot. Powell and WCS are almost 3rd string players.  Harrell would be a good idea to replace Powell if Mavs want to continue with their current system. If they want to go back to last year system when everyone could shot from the 3 they should look for a stretch big.  As to the assets i think we have 2 1st round picks and we can also send some mediocre prospects like Josh Green and Moses Brown. Maybe Sterling Brown too who is a decent role players but he doesnt seem to fit on Mavs that well so far.
of fucking course it comes down to the last shot  God fucking dammit.  That Sterling Brown 3 to end the 3rd is so far the difference maker
"I’d swap out Boban and Sterling for Bullock and Ntilikina. Boban’s not good enough for a team to steal him, and Brown has struggled a lot with with Mavs so far."
"Sterling brown is gone my guy, I'd take Powell, Bullock ,Ntilikina even burke before him"
Luka  Tim Jr  Tingus Pingus  Maxi Kleber  Boban  Dorian Finney Smith  Jalen Brunson  Sterling Brown
"Why? Prized offseason acquisitions Bullock and Sterling Brown are not enough for you? After all, Mark Cuban said the team got significantly better, so it must be true."
Sterling brown instead of DFS???
Sterling Brown has to challenge that. He had 0s across the board.
"I'm not sure what Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock are good for : / what a frustrating lost, ye fuck those refs too."
sterling brown is garbage
"Yeah, idk where this guy is coming from saying our bench is awful. Hell, I would go ahead and say it's a strength of our team. Brunson/Frank/Reggie/Maxi are a very solid unit, along with Sterling Brown rotating in. I know plus-minus isn't the end all, but every single one of our bench players outside of Bullock has a plus differential for the season.  Not only are they solid as a unit, but they fit extremely well with our starters. We've closed multiple games running Luka/Brunson/THJ-DFS/Reggie/KP. I would bet we end up sliding Maxi in and close most games with Luka/Brunson/Reggie/Maxi/KP come playoff time.  Additionally, we still have the $10m trade exception, so even if our bench starts to underperform we have a simple answer to bolster it come the trade deadline. Yeah our center rotation is bad, but we have pieces that can matchup to get us through the regular season. Come playoffs, KP at the 5 with Maxi at the 4 solves most of our problems."
"Actually their bench is pretty nice: DFS/Reggie, Brunson/THJ, Maxi/Dwight, Sterling Brown, Frank, Boban for spot minutes. The only real negatives are WCS and the failure of Josh Green to develop, but the former only plays limited minutes if KP is healthy. Agreed of course that Dwight shouldn't start, and especially not as part of a two-big lineup with KP at the 4."
"Yeah idk who else we could offer for him, maybe add in Josh Green if they want a young player idk, Sterling Brown or Reggie Bullock maybe idk."
"&gt; Haven't watched the Mavericks much, are they that bad with their starters?  Mavs 101, OP:  * First major issue is Dwight Powell. He knows how to do one thing, and that is setting screens. But his screens are clearing up no space, because KP now roams closer to the paint. Now, KP is playing his best ball since the bubble, so this change *is* working, but Powell is a wonky fit. We had a really better offense with Maxi, but he's injured for who knows how long. Luka's bread and butter is driving through a screen and choose between kicking to the corner or throwing the floater. Without the paint space, he is just chucking contested jumpers;  * On +/-, the team as a whole impacts the results, and, other than KP, THJ, Brunson and (yes) Ntilikina, *everyone* is in a cold spell. Bullock and DFS were constantly ranging the 40% from the 3, and both are barely making 20%. Sterling Brown took 6 games to knock down his first 3. Hell, KP before the injury was also in a cold spell. Kidd's offense is generating A LOT of open looks. I repeat, A L-O-T. People are being schemed wide open in the corner or at the key and proceeding to throw bricks. Someone in our sub posted that Luka had 21 possible assists last night, and the bricks that resulted on those open, good looks could build houses for an entire city;  * Kidd's offense works better with Brunson because he is faster. Brunson is nifty, he doesn't need a lot of space to slash, it is quite similar to Ja Morant in that aspect. His floater doesn't require well-set screens, and he is playing recklessly. Kidd gave him the reigns of the 2nd unit and he rode it right to the point that it's tough not to give him the starting nod alongside Luka. Also, Ntilikina plays gnerally with Brunson, and the French Prince is being AMAZING. Catch and shoot threat with borderline elite defense. Oh, and Brunson rarely plays with Powell, so there's that;  * Finally, Luka is off as a whole. He ranges wildly between being hesitant on half court and going full hero ball. Last night he had a lot of open looks that he just ignored because he was bent on banging bodies in the post and hitting the Dirk fadeaway that was ice cold against that Bulls defense. He chose a contested jumper against Vuc instead of doing his signature move of dropping back and throwing the stepback 3. I would say this is less about Luka playing bad basketball and more about him playing dumb, low BBIQ game. As I said, when he is off, the ball moves faster, our pace improves, shots begin to fall and we get in a rhythm. When he goes back, the offense just turns a drama show, where the wings more or less sit on the corner, KP isn't sure about what to do and Powell set up ghost screens that doesn't block anyone. It doesn't help that Luka is relying so much on bad efficient iso looks instead of running the hot hand. Kudos that this isn't an ego thing, because he played second fiddle to Brunson quite often and no pout was to be seen;  * Finally, we are 7-4 because of our defense. All issues on offense with Kidd, his defense is the best I've seen of the Mavs in the last years. KP was unlocked again working on help D, Ntilikina is a monster, Bullock and DFS are playing solid defense, hell, even Luka already had 2 games with 2+ steals and had that nasty block over Sengun. Whenever Powell checks out, our defense is legit elite."
"The reason for this is because Mavs have good role player and our bench beats other teams bench most of the time. But the problem is that we also have role players in the starting lineup except Luka and sometimes KP, thats why our starting lineup gets trashed.   Mavs changed their FO but they are still signing role players like Bullock and Sterling Brown instead of guys that can really help Luka. I never understood why we didnt went after Derozan or Dinwiddie when Lowry plan failed.   Mavs have done such a poor job building over Luka. Gave Curry and Barnes for nothing. Drafted 3 guys last year at 18,31 and 36 and all of them gonna probably be out of the league in 2 years. 0 big signing in the FA even tho we had cap space 2 out of 3 times for a max.  The way this is going i wont be surprised if someone snatches Brunson too next season."
"I mean they *are* 1-10 but even still. Last year's Rockets, the worst team in the league with a 17-55 record, ended with Khyri Thomas at +14 and Bruno Caboclo at 0. They played a total of 11 games *combined*. Anyone who played at least 30 games had at best a -28.  What's kinda crazy about that team is that Sterling Brown played 51 games and everyone else played 41 games or fewer."
Well it'd have to be a three-team trade then because Sterling Brown is on the Mavs.
He was trying to get Brad to sign Sterling Brown and trade him to Philly MarShon Brooks style.
Josh Green. Sterling Brown.
Sterling Brown gave us good minutes off the bench.
Sterling Brown is on the Mavs now!
"Not going to lie I was kind of surprised because our offense is low key garbage. It definitely looks different than last year but not really better, and not to single out anyone but Sterling Brown+ others need to stop shooting the ball or take better shots because I'm getting really tired of watching every one of the team brick open threes"
"Not good. He's trying to implement an offense style that just doesn't work with our roster. He doesn't want Luka to be heliocentric a la James Harden in Houston, which I get and think is a good thing, but we can't afford to not have Luka dominate. Instead Kidd is posting up Dorian Finney Smith or Sterling Brown. Additionally he's playing Dwight Powell and Porziņģis at the same time, and we are playing Porziņģis in the midrange/lowpost. The paint is filled 90% of the time which makes Luka's drives useless.  He has good intentions, like passing the ball around, not relying solely on Luka, but so far it's been fairly unsuccessful. The rotations are bad to mediocre and he's dealing with a flawed and injured roster.  He does seem to have really helped Jalen Brunson's game though so that's a plus.   Overall I'd say 3/10. Carlisle was around an 8/10 while coaching Luka. He got every inch from the 19-21 Mavs, but it wasn't sustainable in the playoffs."
don't understand why sterling brown is still getting minutes and they're taking frank out
"While his slump is the most drastic, it's not the only major one on the team. Luka's shooting 23.8% from 3 (35.0% last year), KP's shooting 23.5% (37.6% last year), Reggie Bullock at 31.0% (41.0% last year), and Sterling Brown at 15.4% (42.3% last year)."
"Lol Mavs are miles better then Clippers. Worry about how you gonna make the playoffs instead of us.  Also we 4-2 and we shot 30% from 3. Meaning that at our worse form we still have a good record. And that % gonna change because Reggie isnt a 31% shooter, Luka a 23%, KP 23%, DFS 18% and Sterling Brown 15%."
Literally drafted better in the 2nd round than the 1st since we got Giannis. Even that specific year we got Sterling Brown in the 2nd round and he’s not amazing or anything but he’s better than DJ.
Has Sterling Brown scored at all this season?
"Bullock will be ok just having an off night, sterling brown thi 😬"
"I don't think they did that bad this off-season. They got a bench which is more than they could say last season. I'd probably taken a PG instead of Al Horford but the roster is much better than last year. Whereas the Mavs got Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown and that's about it."
The mavs fans definitely coping hard. They were calling Bullock and Sterling brown very good moves. 2 mediocre 3 and D guys is not what the mavs needed.
"The closest chick fil a I know to Milwaukee is in this racist hellhole of a suburb, Brookfield, and Milwaukee's suburbs are full of people who pretend basketball stops at the college level and will never go into the the limits except to dip off the highway to go to a Brewers game, so it doesn't surprise me she doesn't know (not to say she's a bigot, she seems great, just that the suburbs have a history of forgetting there's an NBA team).  Same metro area where the cops didn't care Sterling Brown was a basketball player and literally said on tape essentially they'd know him if he was a Brewer before they beat him"
