"Haven't watched any TWolves games this year so I could be off base but I have to think that coaching has played a big role in that. Rubio was rock solid for the Suns last season and it's bizarre that he would drop off so significantly unless he was being misused. I know Dario Saric was pretty upset with how Ryan Saunders shoehorned him into a stretch 4 role, which is definitely not his strength."
Antichrist-Dario Saric The name on the back of his shirt during the bubble was antiracist and from afar it looked like Antichrist
Our best player is out: Booker  Our backup PG is out: Cam Payne  Our backup PF/C is out: Dario Saric  I don’t think suns loosing this game means that Warriors without Klay &gt; Suns
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
"&gt;This is a tired and wildly inaccurate trope.  It's really not. Centers have the responsibility of defending a fuck ton of PnR, protect the rim from literally every offensive player, and prevent offensive rebounds.   &gt;YES, holy shit! That's an emphatic yes.  Throwback to the 2018 Sixers having an elite defense starting JJ Redick and Dario Saric though... Teams can be really good on defense with one bad perimeter defender, and certainly can be better than 24th in the league lmao"
We didnt have dario saric? What other stupid excuse do you have
"ben's played with some great players. he's also dragged a starting lineup of amir johnson/marco belinelli/dario saric/roco to a 16 game win streak, it hasn't all been rainbows and lollipops for him"
I don't know if its still true but Dario Saric never got respect from refs in philly or minny.
"Elfrid Payton for Dario Saric, a future 1st, and a future 2nd. Payton was a pretty popular prospect and the Sixers passed on him for some random European prospect that was never going to come over."
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
I love Dario Argento Saric
"Dario Saric, obviously because he is The Homie and a Process product. But also because his home town is across a bay from where my family immigrated from (It was Italy at the time they left, now Croatia).            I never looked like the other Italian-American kids in school, but then I saw Dario who weirdly looked like me in a lot of ways, looked up where he was from, and legit me and that dude could be 4th or 5th cousins."
"Now is the time to jump on the Suns bandwagon. We're historically a winning team, but the 2010's were very unkind to us. We have, however, taken great strides to turn that around, and I think we've got a lot going for us now.  1) A young star player in Devin Booker that shows improvement every single year (though he's off to a slow start this year) and has shown incredible loyalty and passion to the city/fans.  2) One of the most talented and respected vets in the league in Chris Paul, who people call the Point God for a reason.  3) A high energy young core of players that give it all on offense and defense, ranging from respectable role players to potential All-Stars down the line, in Mikal, Ayton and Cam Johnson.  4) A scrappy bench mob consisting of Cam Payne, Jevon Carter, Dario Saric, and Langston Galloway that is just smothering on defense and lethal on offense  5) An endearing and respectable head coach in Monty Williams.  Biggest drawback is our owner is a cheap bastard with a history of meddling where he shouldn't. Lately though, he's been much quieter and hands off while our new GM, James Jones, has turned our trashcan fire of the 2010's completely around and created a very strong, balanced, and deep team. Things are looking these days, so why not praise the Suns?"
"We got the best bench with Dario Argento Saric, Cam Cammy Johnson, Cam Bring the Payne, and Langston Joey Gallowy"
"Watch Dragic, dude pulls up his socks A LOT  edit: lmao dario saric not dragic"
"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."
I remember when he was still part of The Process with Dario Saric and Sixers fans were waiting for them to come over. I mean Philly is good now but they really had a lot of players who panned out pretty well/serviceable throughout the tanking.
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."
"If you think he’s getting protected over Saric, you haven’t watched the Suns play at all. Dario has been the Suns anchor in the second unit since he got there.   Cameron Payne is a possibility, but the Suns bench *needs* a point guard, so unless we get someone in a trade or FA, Payne would be a necessity."
"One of Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, or Cam Johnson"
Brogdon getting ROY over Dario Saric. Fight me.
The bench as a whole is so much better it isn't funny. You look up some of the crap that was getting minutes in that 2017 team and you'll make yourself sick. It's crazy.   The surrounding talent in the three other starters might be close (except Tobias and Saric. Love Dario but Tobi is much much better) but the biggest difference is Ben and Joel have gotten better as they got more experience. As much as people don't like to think Ben has changed at all.
"Richaun Holmes, Dario saric, Jerami grant, Zach Lavine, Markelle Fultz, tj McConnell, kristaps porzingis, devonte graham, Roco, Ja, nerlens noel"
"We fed ayton, got to the line, and hit open shots  and dario saric"
"Jimmy butler literaly got traded for Dario saric and Robert convington... lol, because of the way he acted on the way out. I get harden has at least one more year on contract but it wouldn’t surprise me if they didn’t get that much for him"
"Oubre was a part of some of our best lineups (which also happened to be some of the best lineups in the league).  It was not addition by subtraction.  What happened in the bubble was Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson both expanded their games and filled the offensive void that was left when Oubre was injured.  Also, Cameron Payne was brought in and immediately added an offensive threat at PG that could distribute and play aggressive defense.  Add Dario Saric coming in to form and basically being a walking double/double off the bench and it all just kind of came together.  No, Oubre was fine for us.  He wasn't perfect, but he was a plus player on the court."
Prince + a few mins work to meet the necessary salary range. People forget we’re paying Prince 12m/year. You only need to hit like 15m to match.  Sixers could do the same with Danny Green who makes 15.5m. Danny Green + Mike Scott = 20m.  Pacers could do Jeremy Lamb + Doug McDermott as filler.  Suns could do Dario Saric + Jae Crowder or one of them + Jalen Smith + a few mins
"Oh shoot, forgot to mention that Dario Saric was out for the Nuggets game.   I wasn’t too surprised by the Jazz win. Donovan is having a slow start to the season, Mikal Bridges is a fantastic defender. I didn’t expect to hold Bojan to 3 points though."
"I blame the Wolves. So many players come here, suddenly get way worse, and are never the same afterward. Not always (Jimmy Butler, Dario Saric) but way too often."
Dario Saric is pretty much the exact same build and can't jump and is a great center.
"Basically this. I certainly wouldn't mind getting Delon or Hill as a backup pg, but outside of them being basically gifted to us for nothing, I don't think that's a priority like a backup 5 is. Saric is great most of the time (though his health has been a bit of an issue this season), but a lot of our woes would be relieved if we had a true rim protector on the bench. It would also allow Dario to play a bit of backup 4 on some nights.  Stix could get there, but he's not there yet."
Dario Saric deserves an honorable mention at the 5
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"**Continuing on my original post, here are some stats I don't use (and why):**  *Team* *stats (or derivatives) that shouldn't be used for player eval:*  * Defensive Win Shares * Defensive rating  *Small samples making them very susceptible to luck / lacking context:*  * dFG% for specific matchups * dFG% on shots not at the rim * Looking at raw on/off court data for players  *Okay to use, but better alternatives exist to measure what people often use them to try to measure*  * Steals - at BBall Index we use Passing Lane Defense &amp; Pickpocket rating to dig deeper into more granular styles of generating steals, rather than the high level generic one. But steals (per 75 or 100 possessions) are still good. * Blocks - they're often the highlight plays, but rim defense goes a bit deeper than just blocks. Impacting FG% at the rim, contesting a high % of shots taken at the rim, and deterring shots from even being taken at the rim are all really important too. * Defensive rebounds - with how many are uncontested, this doesn't tell us as much as we'd like it to. And some players get more/less due to positioning and box out tendencies, so there are lots of variables that just raw rebounding numbers (or rates per X possessions) won't capture.  *Impact stats that I prefer other alternatives for:*  * \[BBall Reference\] D-BPM, because it's limited to only the box score (and DPS from NBAMath is just this but using possessions instead of minutes) * \[NBAShotCharts\] D-RAPM, because it's limited to only on/off data and on single seasons can have a good bit of noise. But RAPM calcs are awesome (and Ryan is awesome) and in combination with box score ""priors"" produce some of the best performing impact stats. * Current D-RPM (the old one was good), because their integration of tracking data doesn't appear to have gone well and the results track really poorly with several others I know have solid methodologies. For example, Draymond from 2016-18 has top marks in D-LEBRON and D-RAPTOR. D-RPM has him 131st, 15th, and 412th in those years. Something's off there. They also continue to change it over and over without actually releasing any info on how it's calculated, so it's hard to evaluate the methodology. * \[Dunks &amp; 3s\] D-EPM, which hasn't released methodology publicly. It has good offensive data integrating a tracking box prior with RAPM calcs, but the defensive side has some strange results (like Dario Saric ranking 2nd, Ish Smith in the 96th percentile, or McCollum being in the 56th percentile). There's no luck-adjusting, which is why we see guys like Saric show up a bit too high (he shows up among the most lucky defenders when comparing RAPM to LA-RAPM)."
&gt; Your team literally drafted Dragan Bender and Dario Saric with lottery picks  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH  You're a 76ers fan that doesn't know Saric was drafted by the 76ers? Thank you for proving every single thing I have ever thought or said regarding the intelligence of people from Philadelphia. Omg you're amazing. And so dumb. Thank you. Comment definitely saved
"So we’re pulling out obscure bbref stats now?  How embarrasing is it for the Suns then that they have a better win% and yet zero titles?  I dont even need bbref stats.  Your team literally drafted Dragan Bender and Dario Saric with lottery picks, and took Ayton ahead of Luka, Trae, Sexton, Shai, MPJ, JJJ, etc...  Your front office are idiots and the fans are just whiners lmaooo just accept that the Suns are not contenders.  All 29 other teams have accepted it.  Even a 2 seed can’t make that team succesful in the playoffs, and that’s if they hold the 2 seed, which spoiler alert they won’t lol"

For the Lakers it was anytime Jared Dudley tried to do anything basketball related.   For the Suns it was Chris Paul forcing all of the offense to run through Dario Saric for the final 15 minutes of the game.
Lebron who? Dario Saric is a beast
"Yeah, he doesn’t get enough playing time to really decide that. Don’t know why he wasn’t playing to cover Dario Saric while Wes Mathews was."
Don’t let the Suns win distract you from the fact that the Wolves traded the pick that would become Cam Johnson and Dario Saric to move up and draft Jarret Culver 🤣🤣
"You got dusted by Cam Payne, Abdel Nader and Dario Saric my man. Take the L. The Lakers are still the defending champs but we got you tonight"
"Abdel Nader, Dario Saric. Good lord."
Suns just had a convincing win with Book ejected and Ayton sitting the whole 4th...  Dario Saric.
"I’m so ready for the “Dario Saric for 6MOTY” campaign   DA absolutely should’ve played minutes in the 4th, but I loved seeing him cheering louder than anybody while the bench closed out the game."
"Ah yes, the two Suns all stars: Dario Saric and Abdel Nader"
"Dario ""The Dream"" Saric"
Devin Booker is a decoy for Dario Saric like Keira Knightley in Phantom Menace
Who knew Dario Saric would lead a Suns wins over the Lakers lol
"Dario ""Luka Doncic"" Saric"
Sixer should have never traded Dario Saric.   Suns fans you have good player coming off the bench.
"Bring in our MVP Dario Saric, or is he injured?"
Yeah I saw him getting carried by Cam Johnson and Dario Saric in the bubble. Flair checks out
Dario Saric. He's been a phenomenal backup 5 for the Suns.
"Who said they were disappointments? Definitely not me.   But I would also bet that when you were drafting Okoro or Garland in the top 5 you weren't saying ""oh boy, I sure hope they end up with a career as good as Dario Saric!""   It was unlikely that Luka was every going to be a complete bust, I'm just saying that just because he was great in Europe it didn't mean he was a sure-fire Hall of Famer either."
&gt;  6 years ago and haven’t been discussed since and then ask other too disprove it.  It wasn't 6 years ago. It was written in 2007!  &gt;then ask other too disprove it.  You are the one that said it was disproved multiple times though. If you just said you don't know much about it but doubt it I would understand but I really think it holds up.  &gt;One minute you are bringing up Cameron Payne as this big loss and the next the suns have the best bench in the league.  It is both and the Suns bench was even better when Cam was on it. It was really good at absurd high levels but slowly went down as the year progressed but is still number 1 in the league.  &gt;Like either you need him greatly and him being injured is a problem or you don’t need him and him being injured is irrelevant.  He helped a ton and was one of the top reasons the Bubble Suns were so good as well as Suns hot start of the season but after a while the Suns are really deep they learned to adapt.  &gt;Dallas has been missing 4 out of their 5 starters  Dario Saric Missed 17 games this year. That is about the same as Dorian Finley Smith and Josh Richardson have missed combined.  In addition Cam Payne has missed a lot of games and he is one of the most important reasons the Suns have been doing so great this year (their bench). I am not saying the Suns have been hurt as much as the Mavs. I am simply saying Mavs aren't the only ones hurt and it isn't fair the discount the success the Suns have had because their opponents were hurt but they weren't.
Dario saric isn’t starting when he is available.
Dario saric missed more than 4 games
The Suns will give you Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky. Take it or leave it!
Nerlens Noel and what eventually became Dario Saric for Jrue Holiday was a great move. Getting rid of Asik's contract for Nikola Mirotic was another one. Pels made a lot of dumb ass decisions but they've been snake bitten too.
Dario saric minutes are not nice from this graph
Dario Saric
I know Dario Saric when I see him and that is Dario Saric
Saric is amazing. Sun's fans will not allow ANY dario hate.
"James jones was responsible for the bubble too and the award was given out before the bubble happened. we were just so bad that it took him 2 years to dig us all the way out instead of just 1. and to do it he made tough moves that many questioned. trading TJ Warren for cash was made fun of. but we needed that cash to get rubio. everyone said the suns reached on cam johnson, but he played a big role in that bubble run and this year. Dario saric came over in the same trade that lead us to draft cam. He's huge for us too. James did all that and we were given an F rating for that offseason. Then he picked up cam payne right before the bubble. payne has been a revelation. Then we sold high on Rubio and Oubre, both of which have been significantly worse this year, to get CP3. and just for fun signed crowder, Langston galloway, Abdul Nader, and etwuan moore. The last 3 of those guys have been really good for us this year and can't even find consistent minutes because we are that deep. to put it in perspective Isaiah Canaan was our starting PG 2 years ago. no one in the league has done a better job than him in the last 2 years and he should be rewarded for it this year.  with ya'll losing last night we would now be 1st in the east now because we own the tiebreaker. apologies for being 8 hours pre-mature."
"For those who may not know yet...  The Suns have gotten great, great production from Dario Saric at C, both in the bubble and so far this season. His position on ESPN and Bball-ref still claims he's a PF, but that's wrong. Monty Williams now uses him 90% of the time at C.  [Here's a whole video about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvOFZQN_9Ro)  The net ratings of those lineups may regress eventually, but Saric is yet another guy who seems to have found a way to thrive in the modern era as a smallball threat. Can space the floor, dribble, pass, and is still strong enough even to challenge guys like Embiid on a night like tonight."
Dario saric revenge game confirmed
"""mvp"" getting outplayed by dario saric this shit funny"
Dario Saric is legitimately better than Deandre Ayton
"Dario Saric, we love him"
"Even worse, they traded Robert Covington for Jaden McDaniels and Ricky Rubio and traded Dario Saric to move up 5 slots in the draft to pick Jarrett Culver"
"wait till we get Dario Saric back, and CP3's back up Cam Payne (who was actually playing awesome.)"
"Dario Saric has been very good for us off the bench, but he’s been out for what feels like forever"
Dario Saric is injured.
"We were out Dario, Payne, Crowder, Nader and Smith today.  Saric hasnt played in i dont remember how long"
"Dario Saric, Torrey Craig, Abdel Nader."
"The Suns are still a playoff team with Rubio instead of CP3. James Jones contracted a deep and balanced team by getting Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, Cam Payne and Torrey Craig. Plus James Jones traded for CP3. CP3 is the difference between being around the 6/7 seed and being the 1/2 seed, but James Jones built this roster and hired Monty Williams. He deserves credit for what he's done, saying CP3 is the only reason for the Suns improvement is ignorant"
Morally I have to say Malik Beasley.  However taking away off the court issues it's Jarrett Culver. The guy fucking sucks and seeing him on the court just reminds me we traded away a potential Tyler Herro or PJ Washington + Dario Saric for him
That draft day trade was amazing. Cam Johnson and Dario Saric are huge for this team
"Yup. Of course adding CP3 was huge, but James Jones hiring Monty Williams, acquiring Cam Johnson and Dario Saric, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig etc. Has given this team amazing depth and experience. This team can make a playoff run because of that"
Favors legitimately one of the worst signings of the summer. Completely useless on both ends. Getting bodied by Dario Saric in the paint when his only value is being big.
Cam Payne and Dario Saric
"Jokic, Embiid, Kat, Vuc, Nurkic, Ayton, Capela, Gobert, Jarret Allen, Porzingis are all head and shoulders better than him wtf are you talking about. Earlier this year before his cold stretch, Dario Saric was leading the NBA in Net Rating. Nobody would be stupid enough to say he’s a top 5 Center."
Dario Saric for PF
"Between 2012 and 2017, the international (no college) players drafted in the lottery were:  Dante Exum Dario Saric Kristaps Porzingis Mario Hezonja Emmanuel Mudiay Dragan Bender Thon Maker Giorgios Papagiannis Frank Ntilkina  There's a good reason why teams are hesitant to draft international players with high picks. There are definitely gems out there, but it's much more difficult to evaluate talent playing in unfamiliar circumstances."
"**Jimmy Butler Trades:**  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(CHI) FOR Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, Lauri Markkanen(MIN)  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(MIN) FOR Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round pick  The Wolves came in with good intentions but came out worse with both Butler trades"
"Just Dario saric who was going to be a free agent.   Honestly the trade wasn't bad, its just that Culver was picked instead of any other number of guys"
Orlando trading Dario Saric and a 1st for Elfrid Payton
Dario Saric should be over Dragic and Ross
"Dragic has been injured quite a bit. I'd give shouts to Alec Burks, Chris Boucher, Dario Saric and TJ McConnell"
Dario Saric deserves consideration. His impact stats are great
Dario Saric is the clear # 2 behind the clear #1 Clarkson

Nothing dario saric does is underrated to any suns fans
You better not be disrespecting Suns HoFer Dario Saric
"Ersan, hornets coach and dario saric all on the all game stop employee team"
"I can't believe the Suns found a way to win with CP3 and Jae having bad games, having no production from the bench (aside of Craig), and shooting 20% from 3 against a pretty competitive team in Charlotte.   My takeaways:  - Charlotte wins this game in regulation if they hit their FTs, the sign of a young team. They're right in the middle of the pack right now in team FT%, if they get that up to 80%+, they're going to start closing out games.   - Devonte' Graham went nuclear on us. He hit some shots yesterday that I couldn't believed, with Mikal Bridges draped all over him. Gotta give it up to him for such a stellar performance.  - Defense travels. The Suns are a great defensive team with the best road record in the NBA. I believe that those two things go hand in hand. Mikal Bridges is an elite wing defender at this point that deserves All-Defense recognition. He has the perfect combination of length, basketball IQ, and an elite transition game. He is shooting 41% from 3 on decent volume, firmly placing him in the elite 3&amp;D tier. Eddie Johnson said it best last night: ""Every great team has a Mikal Bridges.""   - Charlotte got rooked by a combination of Booker/CP3 foul baiting and poor/inconsistent officiating. It's frustrating, but they did have an opportunity to win the game at the line. You can't turn the ball over 20 times and shoot less than 70% from the FT line and then expect to win.  - The Suns struggle with closing games comfortably, particularly against lesser competition. Last night, we saw Book iso on at least 3 consecutive possessions late in t he 4th. He took bad shots and Graham made us pay.   - Dario Saric is struggling. He is a vital cog in what makes our rotations work. When he's not playing well, you can tell because our production falls off of a cliff."
Tell that to Dario Saric in 2016-17
"Alperen Sengun. He is 18 years old and putting up 19.3/9.4/2.4/1.3/1.6 on 70% TS. This in a European grown man league and he is doing it as an 18 year old. Is like number 1 or 2 in the league for points, rebounds, blocks, efficiency and is one of the highest for assists and steals for a bigman. Problem is he is listed as 6'9"" or 6'10"" and he doesn't look the part in terms of athleticism. Some places have him as top 10 in their draft board, some have him as mid second round. He reminds me of Domatas Sabonis but I don't know if that is his floor or his ceiling. At the same age, he was more productive than Jusuf Nurkic, Porzingis, Marc Gasol, and Dario Saric as compared to an [article](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30503246/nba-draft-stock-watch-scouting-international-stars-no-1-pick-contender) (scroll down to see a graph)."
Monty Williams and dario saric will do that.
"For example, you can’t have him but Dario Saric on your team would make them so damn good"
"That’s actually what I meant sorry I wasn’t clear. But when I say big, not like Dario Saric big. I meant actually big. We saw him dominate wiseman who is big but lacks the footwork and discipline to stay with him. But someone like DeAndre who isn’t even that great defensively was able to stymie him."
"Dario Saric.   He is one of our most impactful players and a perfect guy to slot in when transitioning between rotations.   He has great vision, he can create for others, he can shoot, he can work off the dribble, he has a polished low post skill set, he’s an excellent passer, and he plays with a ton of effort in every phase to the point where he’s a good defender, even with his athletic limitations."
Missing Dario Saric and Marcus Smart
"McHale's mother is Croatian, just like Dario Saric"
Dario Saric aka The Homie aka Super Dario Brother aka The Antichrist aka Sinestro
"man, a 3rd year player getting benched in closing time for Dario Saric will probably not be a star"
"Jrue Holiday from Philly to New Orleans has a crazy web too. That was in 2013.  Philly got Nerlens Noel and and a future 1st from New Orleans.   The future 1st was used on Elfrid Payton who was instantly traded to Orlando for Dario Saric, a future 1st, and a future 2nd (lol).   THAT future 1st was used on Shamet, who was traded for Harris.  Dario was traded for Butler, who was traded for Richardson, who was traded for Curry.   The future 2nd in that deal was traded to the Knicks for two future 2nds. One of those 2nds was traded to Dallas in the Curry deal, we still have the other one.   And of course Jrue was traded to Milwaukee for the boatload of picks, so the web will continue on for years."
"What you are missing here is that Chris Paul was not the only addition to the Suns this season. Compare the Suns bench from last year to now. Look at how players like Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric have taken significant leaps as contributors. Look at what newer additions like Jae Crowder and Cam Payne have brought.  I get that not a lot of people watched the Suns last year but it was a very different team in more ways than just Chris Paul. As for those 20 win teams, yeah, it's not a surprise that you win more with a supporting cast who can all legally buy alcohol."
"Dario Saric, he leads the league in net rating by far among players who played significant minutes."
"Dario Saric, underrated by the league at large, properly rated by Suns fans"
Dario Saric 2021 FMVP
"Teams can't get away with having two slow bigs on the floor on defense because they get abused on switches, and on offense it's hard to play with two non-shooters.   ""Traditional"" power forwards can succeed at the 4 if these weaknesses are accounted for. Giannis is great at defending perimeter players, and on offense they have Brook Lopez to space the floor. Sabonis has spacing around him for days. Dudes like Julius Randle, Lauri Markkanen, and Dario Saric are knockdown shooters and good enough ball handlers so they fit well into modern offenses.  The PF position isn't dead, but those who can't shoot and/or defend the perimeter just get run off the court in the playoffs."
"Both were bad rebounding. When saric came in they tried playing small and putting roco on him, we ran the offense through him during that stretch and he played great. Ayton has a pretty bad game just because kanter was killing us on the boards but same thing happened with Dario, Dario just added a different dynamic to the offense because we were able to play through him"
"It is a weird thing. Dario Saric has been a minus on [on/off numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/3239/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) every year (except 1 barely positive at +0.5). Now all of a sudden he is a crazy + 19.6 on/off and has the best [net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=GP*GE*10&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) in the entire league (except Dinwiddie's tiny 3 game sample size). His first two years, Ayton has helped the Suns on both sides of the ball but this year he has been a big negative but so have pretty much all the starters."
When did Dario Saric become this good on the Suns? He has become a legit 6th man and they ran the offense through him. I’m shocked 😳
It's crazy that Dario Saric iso plays are kinda good
Nah bro Dario Saric and Robert Covington are studs and way better than anyone Dwight ever played with!!!
"There was just a thread about this posted by Cranjis McBasketball on NBAdiscussion, the creator of LEBRON, and he concluded that out of the impact metrics he prefers DLEBRON and DRAPTOR, and this is what he said about D-EPM, which he put in the metrics that he wouldn't use for defense:  ""D-EPM, which hasn't released methodology publicly. It has good offensive data integrating a tracking box prior with RAPM calcs, but the defensive side has some strange results (like Dario Saric ranking 2nd, Ish Smith in the 96th percentile, or McCollum being in the 56th percentile). There's no luck-adjusting, which is why we see guys like Saric show up a bit too high (he shows up among the most lucky defenders when comparing RAPM to LA-RAPM). I like the offensive component of this though! Once a writeup is released it'll also be easier to evaluate. ""  Here's the full post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/lxmwf0/the\_set\_of\_data\_points\_film\_to\_use\_for\_a\_holistic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/lxmwf0/the_set_of_data_points_film_to_use_for_a_holistic/)"
"Yeah thanks a lot for clarifying some of my misconceptions here. And don't worry, I've been following your lead and also misspelling ""retrodictive"" as reductive. I think I've heard many people praise EPM for its evaluation of offense, but it's defensive ratings seem a bit weird and differ from many other advanced metrics it seems. For example this season Dario Saric ranks second and Kent Bazemore fourth. Also, for some reason, this metrics really seems to be a lot lower on AD than the others. I heard Tim, Cranjis McBasketball the creator of LEBRON, say that he thinks DEPM is a bit suspect as it seems to suffer from not luck-adjusting the results. For example according to luck-adjusted RAPM Dario Saric looks like one of the luckiest defenders in the league and DLEBRON adjusts for luck so Saric comes out looking much more like what the eye test would suggest. Thoughts?"
I actually disagree. Dario Saric was not gonna re-sign in Minnesota. So I thought trading him to move up from 11 to 6 in the draft was a good move.  Now using that 6th pick to draft Jarrett Culver however...
Right. Dario Saric throat fucked you guys while you flopped around like soccer players. I forgot about that.
Well with the Rockets he was a terrible defender and basically just rebounded. You can get guys like Dwayne Dedmond and Enes Kanter who do that just as well and more. Dario Saric this year and he at his peak have similar rebounding numbers.
Darko Saric can ball. Darko Milicic-sized banger on the boards with Dario Saric range
"i would seriously have to think about whether or not i would want him getting bench minutes over frank kaminsky. dario saric? absolutely not, not even close. and frank gets DNPs for us sometimes. he's scoring 12 points in 30mpg on under 50%ts, which is god awful. more than half his shots are threes and he shoots 30% from there."
Jae Crowder  Dario Saric  CP3  Shall I go on?
If Dario Saric gets hot he's going to be tough to contain.
bit of spice to that dario saric pronunciation i like it
"Dude, DeAndre Ayton, Frank Kaminsky &amp; Dario Saric have no chance against AD &amp; LeBron. Even if they're not 100%. Suns would probably be your ideal first round matchup."
"Yeah that's not really fair though. You can do that with Giannis too, and a lot of Euro players. It's way harder to tell if their game will translate. Will they be Darko Milicic, or Luka Doncic? In that same Jokic draft, Dario Saric and Nurkic were both taken ahead of Jokic. MPJ fell because of injuries but it's not like he was a secret unknown"
"The wolves got roco and dario saric and a 2nd round pick for a player that raises any team’s floor tremendously, and took y’all to the finals dawg. He took so much leverage from our organization when that never had to be the case."
"Yeah the whole team seemed off tonight. B2B have been hit or miss, we usually play up or down to competition. It is also very late into season and we have pretty rested players 0% of time because all games are close. Duno if some tired legs or what. Jae Crowder and Dario Saric being out is not wonderful either. Really hurts interior."
"What about Darko Milicic? Or Ricky Rubio? Or Jan Vesely? Or Dario Saric (No disrespect to Dario, but he was picked over LaVine)? Or Mario Hezonja? Or Frank Ntilinkina?  All of those guys played overseas against adults and were picked early. All of them (Except to an extent Dario) didn't pan out. Using Luka as your example is terrible because he's been that ONE guy who has been amazing. So many other guys have been busts or underwhelming."
Obviously Dario Saric is. But those two are nice pieces to build around him imo.
"All the conversations about Booker and Paul, while such little mention of the team having DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, and Cam Johnson all playing extremely good basketball is what's truly been funny. This team has an elite supporting cast around their top 2.  I think that is the reason Phoenix does not need two guys, and I think CP3 brings a bit more to the team and that is reflected in the impact metrics. If Booker goes down, you trust CP3 to pick up the scoring or get a guy like Ayton more shots and more involved. If CP3 goes down, you lose a great defender and your main playmaker."
"&gt;Guess Frank is officially higher than Dario on the depth chart now, that’s definitely not something I anticipated happening.  Frank's only higher in the depth chart because Saric is still injured. If he has no further setbacks, he'll be over Kaminsky in the playoffs.  Saric has really struggled defensively since he first got injured, though. He's never been good defensively, but he plain sucks now. It's a big issue for us. But it gives Craig more minutes, and he's been amazing for us since the trade. He's going to be a weapon for us in the playoffs."
Dario Saric reeks of mediocrity
Dario Saric
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
There's also Frank Kaminsky and Dario Saric
We got Cam Johnson AND Dario Saric for this guy!
"All they gave up was Dario Saric who wanted out anyway. Obviously didn’t work out, but it was still a fine move imo"
"Healthy JoJo was a beast and I remember thinking they could sneak into the playoffs if he was healthy in 2016-17. The TJ McConnell, Dario Saric, Roco, Embiid 76ers were so fun to watch."
Robert Covington. TJ McConnell. Nerlens Noel. Dario Saric. Jarami Grant. Michael Carter Williams. Christian Wood.
"any CP3 MVP argument is very disrespectful to DBook, Mikal, Ayton, Monty Williams and even Dario Saric and Cam Johnson  just a good team that was ascending and CP3 pushed them over the edge"
"Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell, Matisse Thybulle, Dario Saric, Joel Embiid"
They didn’t have Crowder who’s been an excellent wing defender for them this season. Do u think Kyrie and KD both go off like that if he plays ? I don’t think so. They also had Dario Saric missing which forced them to play Frank.
CP3 and Dario Saric. This is not a joke.
Jimmy butler was traded for Robert Covington and Dario saric.
"""Darko Saric"" Dario Saric's evil twin brother"
Wow I didn't know Darko Milicic and Dario Saric had a family member that's a king pin
You mean Dario Saric right?
"Let me gets this straight, you think Embiid was better 3 years ago, that Tobias Harris now is worse than Dario Saric back then, that JJ Redick is a better ball handler than Seth Curry, and that Amir Johnson is better than Dwight Howard? I have more questions, but those stood out the most"
Or just put Dario “Embiid Stopper” Saric on him
I don't watch many suns game. Is Dario Saric the worst basketball player of all time or is it just to tonight? He's dreadful
"Teams shouldn’t be drafting for “story”. Mikal being from philly and his moms connection is irrelevant, if you think zhaire smith is going to be a better player then you’re right to make the trade. Mikal is as good as we could have hoped for and zhaire had a medical emergency that derailed his career, so it looks bad in hindsight. Teams take gambles like that all the time though. The Jarrett culver/cam Johnson Dario saric trade is worse but doesn’t get talked about at all."
Dario Saric
This wasn’t dirty at all. PG had space to land and in fact did land fine. Dario went to the side not underneath him. Their feet got tangled AFTER PG came down and started heading back up court. In fact PG hopped twice before he and saric even made any contact.
"&gt;The Sixers traded Iguodala for Bynum, who didn’t play, and were left with Holiday, Evan Turner, Jason Richardson, Elton Brand, Spencer Hawes, Thaddeus Young and very few draft picks.  Philadelphia surrendered a grand total of one draft pick in the Bynum trade -- a 2018 first.  And even that pick was returned to the Sixers ( along with Dario Saric ) long before being executed, in return for Elfrid Payton.  &gt; After three years we acquired two future all stars...  So did the other teams I referenced.  Miami acquired Butler and Adebayo ( and Dragic ) without tanking.  Toronto acquired Lowry and Leonard ( and Gasol and Siakam ) without tanking.  Milwaukee acquired Antetokounmpo, and Middleton and Holiday without tanking.  This idea that one has to embarrass themselves for three years just to obtain two All-stars is unsupported by fact, and obviously not the case."
"We R Who We R. Now excuse me while I go back to watching us get destroyed by Dario Saric, because who are the Heat if not the team to shut out a star one night, just to get demolished by a role player the next 😬😬"
"PG: Doncic, SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, SF: Bojan Bogdanovic, PF: Vucevic, C: Jokic  Bench: Dragic, Pokusevski, Mirotic, Zubac, Bjelica, Boban, Dario Saric, Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Samanic...  2 All NBA players and 3 stars (Vucevic was an all star) in starting lineup. Crazy stacked bench.   This team would crush everyone except USA, and it would be on even levels with USA considering they have MVP and a Luka ""2 All NBA First teams in first 3 seasons in the league"" Doncic."
"He's targeting backup big men. If the Clippers advance, Dario Saric better watch out."
Sponsored by Dario Saric
Good question but you haven’t considered the possibility that Dario Saric could win
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
"This is so bizarre. I thought I would read an insightful post about position normalcy and instead got a condescending Thunder fan who thinks the Suns would have a very low ceiling without Paul. I mean, sure, we would have been a lower seed in the playoffs, but we still would have made them pretty comfortably. He has rescued us in multiple games, both regular season and playoffs, not discounting his effect. But very low ceiling and no leadership? That's a joke.  Also, the team doesn't play completely classic. Dario Saric or even Torrey Craig at the five is a bit abnormal, but we run it depending on the other team. If we had the tools like a Ben Simmons or Jokic we would definitely run a far different offense and defense. However, even in the NBA guys like those are the outlier.  I have enjoyed watching CP3 run the offense, as I do love  great point guard play, and the rest of the team in more position-normal roles. But I don't think we run it as a matter of fitting into positions, but because it is the best use of what we have."
1. Joel Embiid  2. Ben Simmons  3. Robert Covington  4. Dario Saric  5. TJ McConnell

"Dario Saric lol. He was struggling as of late but showed out to his old self last night. When he was balling early in the season, he was a top 10 player according to advanced stats.  During the bubble, his message on his jersey was “antiracist” but everyone thought it looked like antichrist so that’s what we call him now. Either that or Super Dario."
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"Dario Saric, take it or leave it."
"This is a good viewpoint. Useful for lineups, not for players.  Halfway through the season Dario Saric had the best +/- on our team and some people were wondering if he should take more of Ayton's minutes.  Saric was playing well, but he wasn't better than Ayton. He just was always paired up with a group that was dominating other 2nd units"

I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come .

Don't know if I'd call Dario Saric a star tbh
"The Suns were having a hard time against Anthony Davis alongside the rest of the mass the Lakers have inside. I don’t think there’s a Suns fan around who didn’t expect the Lakers to be a tough matchup, because the Suns have only one true big, then just Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky, both of whom more naturally play the 5 as a secondary position.  I also don’t think there’s a reasonable Suns fan who thinks that the rest of the playoffs will be a cakewalk. But the way the team performed throughout the season, Suns fans have good reason to feel confident.  Winning the championship? Maybe. Maybe not. Paul’s super important as a facilitator and a leader. But you’re making this team sound worse than it’s played."
"He has to play the 5 on offense but he can't really defend 5s on defense, he's too small to challenge Ayton at either end, the Dario Saric lineups drag him out to the perimeter where he's even less effective, he allows the Suns to pack the paint on defense and send double teams in the post if you play him with another big, there are many issues with Trezz that keep him from being a playoff player."
1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
Dario saric was gonna be gross.  Mostly Bc whenever he played Miami he torched us while with philly
"He didn't leave MN in free agency, he was traded (for RoCo, Dario Saric and loose change)."
Can we somehow trick the Hawks into thinking Jalen Smith and Dario Saric are good?
"Take Crowder out for The Homie, Dario Saric."
Bring in Dario Saric
"Same thing with Dario Saric. I wish Monty would give his minutes to Craig. He's more athletic, can actually defend someone, and he also hits his 3s. Saric is a better playmaker, but he lost his mojo 3-4 months ago after several ankle injuries. He can't move his feet, and he can't jump over a brick."
they are able to guard Anthony Davis and Andre Drummond with Cam Johnson and Dario Saric.  Pathetic by the lakers.
drummond is no match for athletic marvel Dario Saric
"Monty I don't want to see Saric again unless someone fouls out. Ayton, Craig, Crowder, Frank, anybody. Leave Dario on the bench."
"Dario ""Andre Drummond"" Saric"
Dario Saric is a fucking problem  For the Suns
"Dario ""Sleeper Agent"" Saric"
"Dario Saric can't pass for shit, dude is garbage."
Dario Saric looks like one of the McPoyle brothers from IASIP
Dario Saric what the fuck was that?
It’s exclusively for Dario Saric
"Also Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Landry Shaker, possibly? Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Iguodala, Lou Will"
1. Frank Kaminsky pull up 3   2. Frank Kaminsky spin move   3. Dario Saric running towards a loose ball
"Jimmy got traded for Robert Covington, Dario saric, Justin Patton, Jared bayless, and a second. Kawhi got traded for an all nba player (derozan), a young center with potential (poetl) and a pick that became keldon Johnson. Safe to say that jimmy was easier to trade for."
Lmao I never thought I'd see Dario Saric stare somebody down after a block
Sixers legends Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric on the floor
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"

Suns in 4. Dario Saric drops 60 on ADisney
Embiid had a way better cast once and they played less than 20 games together. I don't think it's fair to say Robert Covington and Dario Saric as your 3rd and 4th best players is a much better cast than those best Pelican teams.
"TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Dario Saric. Those were process guys, not first round picks, but second rounders/undrafted/gleague players/eurostash never coming over players. And they're each putting in work somewhere and earning good minutes. The only reason Silver intervened was because we weren't a small market, we were a big market and we blew up an 8 seed roster which had failure after failure and no obvious way forward to contention, it took us 5 years to go from mediocre to 1 seed. I'd fucking do it again in a heartbeat if we ever got back to that 8-10 seed mediocrity."
"I don't see how he deserves it over Monty. Monty led the Suns from the 10th seed to a game behind the best record in the league.  He completely revitalized the career of Cam Payne, Dario found a new role as a small ball center in Monty's system, we brought Craig over from Milwaukee and he fit in right away. Obviously the CP3 addition helped but most people expected the Suns to be a 6 seed at best.  If someone told you Cam Payne, Dario Saric, Jevon Carter, Cam Johnson, and Frank Kaminsky would lead the best bench in the NBA before this year you wouldn't believe it, but they've all thrived under Monty's system."
"Good for him.  He's gotten a lot out of Ayton on the defensive end, he's somehow cobbled together a great bench unit from the 1-5 combo of Cam Payne and Dario Saric, he's gotten a ton out of their young wings in Johnson and Bridges, and he's utilized Booker well off-ball."
I was going to put in the last 5 years and l had Malcolm Brogdon vs Dario Saric typed out. Lmao.
"I don't see how he deserves it over Monty. I don't wanna hear bubble talk because everyone always says those games are overrated because almost all of our opponents were missing players.   Monty deserves immense credit for leading the Suns from the 10th seed to a game behind the best record in the league.  He completely revitalized the career of Cam Payne, Dario found a new role as a small ball center in Monty's system, we brought Craig over from Milwaukee and he fit in right away. Obviously the CP3 addition helped but most people expected the Suns to be a 6 seed at best.  If someone told you Cam Payne, Dario Saric, Jevon Carter, Cam Johnson, and Frank Kaminsky would lead one of the best benches before this year you wouldn't believe it, but they've all thrived under Monty's system."
"Yea same here. I had a parlay with the warriors. Being a lifelong Spurs fan, loosing to Cameron Paynes, Dario Saric and E’Twaun Moore a day or two after Duncan’s HOF inauguration was painful."
dario saric is the great value version of jokic
tell that to Dario Saric
You are comparing Anthony Davis and Dario Saric   And calling me an idiot lol
Because if Dario Saric is the difference between winning and losing a title   You weren’t actually gonna win the title lol   Dario doesn’t matter   AD actually did
You think I’m angry and you are bringing up Dario Saric and Victor Oladipo   If I’m “angry” you need to be hospitalized for insanity
Dario fucking Saric   They beat the healthy Heat  The suns haven’t taken a game off a healthy team lol
Also two of those teams made it to game 7 and two of those teams made it to game 6.  1969 finals was just as close as 2016 finals if I’m not mistaken (4 point loss in game 7). It seems like Dario Saric going down is destroying the suns chances at winning another game this series.
"trades are still a thing. for example, if the cost to get Jimmy Butler in 2018 was only Robert Covington and Dario Saric i don’t see how they couldnt have competed with that offer"
Dario Saric died for this
The championship parade will be Dario Saric walking alone in the streets of Phoenix with the Larry O'Brien trophy.
"What about when Butler was done in Minnesota? He was traded to the Sixers for Jerryd Bayless, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and a second round pick. Portland definitely could have made a better offer than that"
"In 2017, George was traded for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, at a time when Dipo was seen as as disappointing and Sabonis as solid but nothing special. In 2018, Jimmy was traded for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round draft pick."
Oh and do yourself a favor and focus on Dario Saric in the corner react to the speech lmao
"If they had a bigger 4 and at least a backup big who isn't Dario Saric or Frank Kaminsky they would be immensely better. It would never be as effective as the raptors, but the gameplan would be similar."
"Damn, who knew Dario Saric was the key behind the suns success."
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"Noel and Embiid were both injury concerns, which explains the Okafor pick decently well. There were also reports that Hinkie was ready to sell high on Okafor the spring of or summer after his rookie season, a la MCW, but he was fired too quickly.  As far as talent evaluation goes, people always seem to forget he was responsible for taking chances on several players who have been contributors to playoff teams. TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerami Grant, and Christian Wood to name a few.  I think he would've shined the most retooling a championship contender, in the ilk of his old mentor, Morey. His real strengths were less in the lottery and more in the late second round, acquisition of G Leaguers/undrafted players, and trades. All things the Sixers could use now."

"Trading for Marc Gasol didn't make the Raptors definitively better than the 76ers, Bucks or Warriors in 2019, and it came at the price of two former first rounders (both drafted higher than Maxey and Thybulle!) that the Raptors spent years developing. But they did the trade anyways, the stars aligned, and the team won a championship.  The reality is that Lowry would have given the 76ers a golden opportunity to win it all this year considering the fact that the Nets got hobbled, the Bucks are coached by Bud, and the Suns' backup centers are Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky. AND the reports indicated that Lowry would have re-signed with the team that traded for him, in case things didn't work out this year. Oh well."
"Lol bro you won’t ever convince me for whatever reason losing saric is a bigger loss than Donte. Saric plays 10 mins a game , donte plays 40 and would make it harder on CP and book for switches. Dario got abused on defense still"
Dario Saric isn't playing. Honestly how much of a difference would he make to Giannis
Dario saric should not be the difference between a finals win vs loss…
"Ah yes, Dario Saric, Giannis stopper."
"They lost Dario Saric and the calls were bad for Ayton. Doesn't change how they shot, Booker going ice cold, or Giannis hitting his free throws, but they had a tough time at the 5 tonight."
"They lost Dario Saric, give them a break. that’s about as much adversity as the suns have faced all season"
Few more:  Eric Gordon/Cam Payne   Trevor Ariza/Torrey Craig  Gerald Green/Cam Johnson (kinda)  Ryan Anderson/Dario Saric
Suns got Cam Johnson and Dario Saric for trading down from the pick that became Jarret Culver.
Dario Saric also put on 25 pounds on his ass as he transitioned as a center.
"Just because 20 point leads are blown more often, doesn’t mean it’s an acceptable outcome, *especially* in the playoffs.   And those are just examples. Other “lesser” guys who the fanbase always really appreciated because of their hard work and hustle would be guys like TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Dario Saric. Any time those guys come back to Philly, they still get standing ovations."

"He averaged 10 mins a game in the Clipper series and put up like 5 points/3 rebounds a game. Mil doesnt have a big man that can dominate the paint...Phx can replace his production with a combo of Jae, Cam Johnson, and Craig at the backup small ball 5.  Totally feel for Saric...a torn acl is always heartbreaking, esp this late in the season as it all but guarantees a lost season next year. But I'd say the injury to Dontae and Giannis playing on a hyper extended knee impact the series much more than phx losing Dario"
The excruciating cruciate ligament tear of Dario Saric by the coward Brook Lopez.  And Lopez took out Chris Paul's ankle with a flagrant foul later in the game as well. Paul tweaked it but luckily was able to resume play.
Throwback to 2 years ago when everybody said the Suns really tanked all year for Dario Saric and to draft Cam Johnson

dario saric hurt? Asterisk finals
"Holy shit, Dario Saric just jumped.  This is serious now."
I would totally sell some of the lower tier guys if I could (but sadly you can’t). Meaning I would offer someone +15000 on like Dario Saric and be happy if anyone took the bet.
"James jones immediately added veteran players that could actually play once we hired him. Even guys like Dario Saric, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio are all players who can actually contribute in minutes they are given, unlike literally almost every other single player we had before then"
It’s because Dario saric is a classy guy
"Yes, significantly. That said, don’t let Capela’s 6’10” deceive you, he plays like a 7-footer.  Also, there is a good chance Jae Crowder/Torrey Craig/Dario Saric end up guarding Lopez with DA assigned to Giannis."
Dario Saric
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
"Yeah, imagine if Dario Saric wins Finals MVP too."
Dario Saric
You could get Denzel to play Jae Crowder and Bruce Greenwood could play Dario Saric
They got Dario Saric to the finals tho
"The Sixers get criticized because they were SO overt about it.   The front office was setting a team up for failure.   What's more, they have little in the way to show for it.   Noel?   Okafor?  Michael Carter-Williams?  Markelle Fultz?  Elfird Payton/Dario Saric?   And Ben Simmons.  They spent YEARS losing to pick up all those players.  And the only one who is still with the team has show no progress in his five years with the team.   The only player who panned out was Joel Embiid, and they got him in 2016.    Trying to WIN and build organically around Embiid would have been far easier for the Sixers than tanking every years.  We've seen with the Warriors that exceptional scouting and player development is the best approach to the draft.  Their dynasty was build primarily through the draft (Curry, Klay, Dray, and Barnes), none of whom were even top-five picks, and a couple of shrewd trades (for Bogut) that made the team a landing spot for free agents like Durant.  When you are winning, free agents are drawn to your team.  They had a sucky year last year, and it was not much better this year due to injury, but they still made a sincere effort to reach the playoffs.  And they still have great draft positioning with a early first-round pick in Wiseman on the roster now, and two lottery picks coming their way.   Sure... you can fairly expect to suck for a couple years during a rebuild and get a couple of early picks, but don't stay down there for five years trying to draft your entire starting line-up. You'll just end up with a losing culture."
Dario Saric and the 29th pick

Why is Dario Saric in the game ?
"Yes, Ayton needs to play with more force, my comment was that he had one off game but had otherwise been good this series.  People seem to be overreacting to this one game and thinking someone like Dario Saric is the answer. PG-13 hit tons of tough, contested shots in game 5, is it automatically bad defense if the opponent's shot goes in?"
"It was literally one game.  In the first 4 games Ayton was absolutely crushing the Clippers.  Dario Saric is not the answer, trust me."
at this rate looks like it will be Dario Saric vs Bogdan Bogdanovic and you will like it.

Haha his jersey in the bubble had the name “Antiracist”.  At first glance it looked like Antichrist and over on the Suns sub a meme was born. Dario Saric was then known as the ANTICHRIST!
"Sometimes he plays like Dario Saric and other times he plays like the Antichrist.   When he plays like the Antichrist he’s a really really good backup to DA.   I think Covid kinda fucked him up a bit, he has flashes of the Antichrist but overall he hasn’t looked the same since."

Dario Saric is my creepy uncle
I just wrote a whole thing about how I don’t know why him and as I was about to post it I remembered it was him who threw the ball at Dario Saric when he scored late in the game at a point where some may call it poor sportsmanship and Clarkson was mad. No one touches our Super Dario hahaha

Dario Saric has the kind of name that sounds way better if Sean Connery says it...
Is Dario Saric the worst player in NBA history or does he just look like it 100% of the time?
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"He's a lot more mobile than those 3 guys, but also a fair bit smaller. More of a Dario Saric/John Collins sized than Vuc sized. He is a good post player but can face-up as well. Pretty good passer. Has a jumper but the mechanics seem a little inconsistent at this point - I think he will be a threat from deep though.  I've seen other people claim he will be a bad defender, but I'm not so sure based on what I've seen, he has quick feet for his size and a knack for recovering. Don't think he will be a Bam type defender on the perimeter, but I think he will be a lot better on the perimeter than the 3 guys you listed.  Reminds me of a smaller, less physically gifted Embiid. I think he'll be a borderline starter, and will struggle with bigger matchups but will always have a role because of his shooting and IQ.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcGs9Ts8q_M  This is a good video for film compilation of him (i.e. not just highlights)"
Would you rather have Dario Saric or AD?  Only one is still left in the playoffs.
You’re forgetting Dario Saric. That brings Book down the 4th best imho.
"I mean it’s painfully obvious Book is stealing the spotlight from Dario Saric, you’re just not paying attention."
Yeah that season only netted us Joel embiid (pretty big addition IMO). Also turned the Pelicans pick (from jrue trade) into Dario saric and getting our pick back from the magic. But sure dude your plan would have been better and pleased the basketball gods by building “the right way”
"Let's look at Hinkie's first round draft record:   * 2013: Michael Carter-Williams (11th) - ROY, flipped for another first rounder * 2014: Joel Embiid (franchise player), Dario Saric (starter, part of Jimmy Bulter trade) * 2015: Jahlil Okafor (bust).  * Pre-2016 draft: Hinkie forced out, Colangelo takes over. * 2016 draft, just for context: The Colangelo-led Sixers draft Ben Simmons #1 overall  I only see one lottery whiff on Hinkie's record (Okafor.) So I don't know where you're getting that from.   The Hinkie-accumulated assets were mostly used to 1) trade up for Markelle Fultz in the draft (Colangelo) and 2) to trade for Jimmy Butler and 3) trade for Tobias Harris (both Elton Brand)."
Are we gonna talk about that 7 minute stretch where it took THREE clippers to keep DARIO fucking SARIC off the damn o glass LMAO
LETS GO DARIO SARIC
Dario Saric is playing so much better today. Good for him
"Man, seeing Cousins not just bodybagging Dario Saric reminds me of how much his game suffered from those injuries."
"Minnesota got Dario Saric, RoCo, and a pick. CJ’s value is miles better than that weak ass package."
"&gt;Cameron Johnson or Dario Saric could’ve helped the Timberwolves problem at the 4 this season   Dario was desperate to get out of Minnesota, he had a terrible attitude since day 1. And he's a shit defender when forced to play the PF."
Cameron Johnson or Dario Saric could’ve helped the Timberwolves problem at the 4 this season
Still can’t believe we passed on Culver for Cam Johnson and Dario Saric smh
"Sengun seems like a slightly more athletic Dario Saric to me. Better ball handler, too."
"I mean, he's gonna be Dario Saric going forward soon if he can't perform this year. Not that Saric is a bad player, but it is disappointing for a high lottery pick in Lauri to be relegated to that kind of role when he was flashing enough talent to be called baby Dirk."
"We're definitely seeing more of a transition to small-ball in the playoffs if it means that teams don't have to put a player on the court that'll get exploited. Jeff Green, Marcus Morris, Dario Saric and Bobby Portis all come to mind. I would not consider any of them to be a traditional 5.  But as I mentioned, even the small-ball guys got paid."
"Even though we got Jimmy Butler at the time, Dario Saric was second-fav behind Embiid, and I was legit sad to see him go, even if it helped in the extreme short-term. The fact that RoCo was also part of the package to Minny killed me."
"Bro are you being serious? CJ had much higher value at the beginning of his big deal. Do you even remember what Philly gave away to get Buckets? Roco and Dario Saric! Jrue was flipped for Eric Bledsoe. You can be a blind Neil Oshay supporter if you want, but a better GM would of made better moves. Enjoy the next ten years of first rounds knockouts you putts."
"Who would have ever thought Dario Saric would be an effective backup 5?   Considering some similar skills and athleticism to Saric, he might just be able to take all those backup minutes from Drummond"
"So we’re just ignoring that the nuggets had a great record to close out the season without him. And beat the blazers without him.   By your logic, the Bucks winning the title is a complete fraud because Chris Paul’s wrist was injured and we lost Dario Saric in the first game.   I cannot believe how sensitive r/nba is that the former cellar dwellers got so good so fast."
"No, he brought in shitty players. No one would want or pay for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel, or Christian Wood on their rosters to support their stars."
"Wiggins - People kinda forget that the dude won rookie of the year  Michael-Carter Williams - He had arguably the greatest debut game this side of Chamberlain, and he even won ROTY  Dario Saric - This doesn't fit in with the rest, but Dario was a high-end role-player as a rookie, and in all honesty has slightly digressed since then  Christian Laettner - Eventhough he's most famous for being hated in college and then nationally-resented for being on the dream-team over Shaq, the dude actually started his career off well, but outside of one season in Atlanta, the rest of it was very underwhelming  Tyreke Evans and OJ Mayo   Vince Carter (first 3 seasons) - In 2000, most people would've picked Vince Carter over both Iverson and Kobe. Thats how good he was perceived to be, and in that context, 8 all-star games in a 20+ year career is kind of a disappointment"
objection worked for phx.  they traded the 6th pick (Jarrett Culver) to the Wolves for the 11th pick (Cam Johnson) + Dario Saric.
Interesting that you didn’t mention drafting Joel Embiid. That was a home run.   Dario Saric was also in the same draft and he was used to trade for Jimmy Butler.
Sixers ended up getting Jimmy Butler for Robert Covington and Dario Saric after a shitty beginning of a season with these sorts of rumors. Think that's where it ends up?
Jarret Culver (pick 6) for Dario Saric and Cam Johnson (pick 11)  Many saying Suns were stupid to do it. Yet Culver is hardly playable and Saric/Johnson were key role players on a finals team
"The Suns traded the pick that ended up being Culver to the t-wolves and got the pick of Cam Johnson and Dario Saric. Everyone blasted the Suns for this at the time, media and fans"
&gt; Darko Šarić  the unholy spawn of Dario Saric and Darko Milicic
I thought that said Dario Saric at first and was extremely confused
[Remember when Culver was supposedly better than Dario Saric and Cam Johnson combined?](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/21/nba-draft-trade-grades-jarrett-culver-suns-wolves)
"No team EVER wins because of their bench. Benches are literally replaceable. If you swap the Suns bench to a team with no stars, you wouldn’t  think twice of these guys. Cam Payne was out of the league a year ago. Dario Saric has been on a few teams and made no impact. Cam Johnson is solid but unspectacular.   Do you need good bench  play? Of course! But what I’m saying is unless you’re in an anomaly situation like say the nets, or if you’re very young, every nba team has a good enough bench. You just don’t notice bc they don’t have the stars ahead of them. That’s how talented the league is. If you swap 90% of teams’ bench into Phoenix with that starting 5, they’d be just as good"
"The difference is that Suns already had Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, and more importantly - they have shown to the management that they are capable of winning before going all in with CP3 and Crowder. Suns were good enough to be 5/6th in the West with Rubio, but it was CP3 who pushed them into contender status.  In Pelican's case, they have a core of two players who still have to learn to play together and show they can win. Adding a 35-year-old Lowry makes them barely a playoff team with no much room to grow. By year 3, Lowry will be 38 and they'll find themselves without young prospects and not enough meat to make some serious noise.  EDIT: they did get  Valanciunas, and that is a huge plus."
"What is it with this sub and role players….Their bench is cam Payne, Dario saric, cam Johnson, Jae crowder. There is nothing special or unique at all about any of these players. It’s the stars being better that rises the level of the role players.   Any GM in the league can create depth, but it’s getting the stars that’s the hard part. Once you have a top 4 of Lowry, Zion, Ingram, and Jonas, it will I turn make the exact same role players look better.  Bc they (the role players) are asked to do less"
"Also in the Carmelo Anthony trade to the Knicks 3 draft picks involved in the trade are recognizable players today. The picks used to select Dario Saric, Jamal Murray, and Jakob Poeltl we’re all traded in that one transaction."
"I mean, we have seen the Heat and now Nets construct rosters with no picks involved, and the Lakers constructed a championship roster with basically nobody homegrown. Milwaukee sold their farm and just won a title.  FRPs are great, but not every team needs them at every moment. Especially when you still need to actually draft a good player.   For example, trading the thirteenth pick and a slumping backup big for the sixth pick doesn’t sound bad. Then you realize we traded Dario Saric and Cam Johnson for Jarrett Culver and it looks much worse."
he's a borderline superstar when Dario Saric guards him
I’m pretty sure the suns weren’t outrebounded because of CP3 and book but rather because their starting pf is 6’6” (Jae) and the backup center was 6’7” Torrey Craig’s or Cameron Johnson (6’8” but not that strong). It would have even been better if we had Dario saric and he really is a small ball 5 at 6’10”
A center who can pass? The Suns have a Dario Saric sized hole to fill
Dario saric
"Since trading away Mikal Bridges, Dario Saric and letting Jimmy Butler walked, all 3 players have made the NBA finals while the Sixers still have not gotten out of the second round"
"The Sixers also traded Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric, 2 members of the process, and Jimmy Butler who left them and those made the finals while the 76ers still can't get out of the 2nd round"
It's very entertaining lol. Dario fucking Saric.   He really wouldn't make a difference.
I've watched Dario Saric.   He won't make a difference vs Giannis. Let's be real here.
Dario Saric got injured early in the series which is the only reason Kaminsky has seen any play. He wasn't the first big off the bench this year and no one thought that about him. Him playing well at all is a surprise considering he's an end of bench guy.
"It’s borderline whether Dario Saric is even one of our five best players, but from a matchup POV we need him out there to rebound. Bench boards are the biggest place the Bucks are stomping us, and his rebound rate is outstanding."
"Dario Saric, our unsung hero"
The Suns have their ideal rotation -8 minutes of Dario Saric.
"Teams shouldn’t be penalized for having injuries and/ or lots of covid protocols that affected their regular season either... so don’t bring it up cause it’s not relevant.  Houston literally became a 2 man team when they turned to their super small ball playstyle and one of those players was injured. Thats far from full strength.   It doesn’t matter that Denver beat the clippers. They were worse by like every standard. Denver just matched up extremely well against them and they had a historic choke. The playoffs are all about matchups.  You’re clearly just a casual that only values big names. The clippers were probably the championship favourites if they were all healthy, but the damn MAVERICKS pushed them to 7 so there’s 0 guarantees there. Lakers didn’t prove shit even before AD got injured. They had a bad overall roster around Lebron and AD and Lebron and AD weren’t playing to their usual standard. And besides them yeah the suns were easily the best team. They were a top defensive team. Had great shooting. 2 top 20 or so talents in the league. Elite coaching. Good depth. Etc. Just cause they didn’t have a superstar doesn’t mean they weren’t a top team. You also seem to conveniently ignore all of the injuries Phoenix had in the post season, from CP being injured in round 1 to having Covid in round 3 to Dario Saric going down. And no the best team they played prior to Milwaukee was a clippers team that just closed out a series against the 1st seeded Jazz and was playing exceptionally well, especially considering CP missed the first two games and then was recovering from covid in the next two.   The fact is you can’t call this a fluke, and then not say anything about the lakers who dodged the consensus top two contenders in the league besides them, benefited immensely from injuries AND played in the damn bubble, where the circumstances immensely benefited players and lead to plenty of ‘flukey’ runs from teams and players alike"
"&gt; Yeah, my mistake for interpreting his starting 5 exactly as he presented it. Fuck me, right?  I guess? Just seems weird that you wouldn't assume the ability of the coach to just play whatever lineup they think is best. Like did you assume come playoff time they wouldn't be allowed to have lineup adjustments? But whatever, my bad for assuming, sorry.  &gt; Oh, please. Every contending small ball team in the last 5 years could at least shoot from 4 out of 5 positions.  Yes I agree, if clarke was playing big minutes next to simmons there would be problems. But besides that I just don't see the need for 5 shooters. The whole point of small ball is to have 5 quality offensive players, and so that you don't have to play some unskilled big (e.g. rudy gobert). Simmons would still be a fantastic small ball 5, on offense at the very least.  &gt; And so is saying they are a contender when you have multiple teams with top 10 players they have to compete against. Simmons can’t be your second best player on a championship team.  I think the jury is still out on Ben Simmons when he has a team built to accommodate his deficiencies. Sure this team would never be favored to beat the nets or lakers, but the way most people use the term ""contender"" is fairly broad. I could say something like ""a team with devin booker as their best player when there are teams with multiple top 10 players will never be a contender,"" but most people consider the suns to be weak contenders at worst. Also FYI I never even said this team would be contending, although I think they would be, when you consider the normal, broad definition of the term.  I'll just add, in 2017-2018, the sixers went 52-30 and were the 3rd seed in the east (this was good enough for 3rd in the west too). Joel Embiid played 63/82 games last year. Jo/Ben's best supporting players were robert covington, jj redick and dario saric. Fucking Jerryd Bayless played about 20mpg in the regular season. In other words the supporting cast was dogshit and they had 60 games of embiid instead of james harden, and that team still was the 3rd seed. I hope this shows why reading that the team in OP's post has a ceiling of 5th seed gives me an aneurysm."
Rosas wasn't _that_ good. Cam Johnson and Dario Saric for Jarrett Culver is indefensible
"I don't think Dario Saric is able to walk without crutches yet, so I MIGHT be able to take him"
"That's ridiculous. The standard for a retired jersey is way too low. Hell, the standard for a tribute video is way too low. The Sixers gave Dario Saric a tribute video and the Heat retired Michael Jordan's number"
"Dragan Bender, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Dario Saric, Enes Kanter, Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, Ricky Rubio.  It's not that hard to understand. The hit rate on the top international guys leading up to Doncic was very poor, and Luka had worse physical tools than most of them. Ricky Rubio was billed as a can't miss guy in a similar vein to Luka, and then he missed."
"Every contender thinks that.  I'm sure the Suns feel that way about Dario Saric, and CP's injured hand/shoulder.  But every team is a little beat up by that point in the year.  Just part of the game."
"If I told you we once had a GM who compiled a team of: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Dario Saric, TJ McConnell, Covington, Christian Wood, plus a ton of upcoming firsts and pick swaps, only to be pushed out by Big Collar....."
Dario Saric the fuckin homie
1. Anthony Bennett (no brainer)  2.Derrick Williams drafted 2nd after Kyrie (bust)  3. Wiggins (without a doubt overrated)  4. Dario Saric (He's Euro BIRD!)  5. Karl Anthony Towns and DLo (hot take but they're both softer than Charmin so they'll have to be included on my list)  Extra: Go ahead and include the entire lottery from the 2013 draft.   Thanks for reading
"Dragan Bender. I thought he would be the next unicorn, do it all big man. All those videos of him pre draft where he was handling the rock and playmaking me hyped.  Turns out, he literally couldn't do anything in the NBA. Forget being the next unicorn, he couldn't even be the next Dario Saric."
"In terms of what? I mean most euros historically are on the older side since the waive of drafting young euro prospects is fairly new. And summer league as mentioned doesn’t matter, but here are some euros that exceeded expectations as rookies and had strong seasons: Dario Saric (best comparison imo), bogdan bogdanovic, Luka Doncic, kristaps, Pau and Rubio"
"who would you say is more athletic, Dario saric or Zach lavine?"
"Even in the last 5 years , prime Jimmy Butler for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a second round pick was a travesty, especially if Houston’s 4 FRP offer was real. I get that RoCo was a valuable role player in his prime and Saric was coming off a really good sophomore season, but that isn’t enough for what Butler offers"
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"&gt;nobody cares that Dario saric was out for the suns  I cared dammit, I cared. The homie will always have a place in my heart"
What? Dario Saric went down with a torn ACL in Game 1 of the Finals.
"Yeah, I’m not sure if it’s enough. I don’t think it’s a terrible offer though.   Trade value can plummet when a player threatens to sit out. For instance, Philadelphia traded Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler when he demanded a trade. This proposed offer from the Timberwolves is certainly better than that trade. Beasley is a 40%, high volume shooter, McDaniels has a lot of potential, Reid is a solid backup center, and Beverley has a ton of playoff experience. The 76ers also have a chance to package the first round picks for a Star later.   Honestly, I’m not really sure if a drastically better offer is out there:  -	The Raptors reportedly don’t want Simmons after drafting Scottie Barnes. Which makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Warriors don’t think that Simmons and Draymond fit. Which also makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Kings are unwilling to offer Fox or Haliburton, and an offer based around Buddy Hield seems similar to the Wolves current offer.  -	The Trailblazers aren’t trading Lillard. Maybe they’re willing to trade CJ? I’m not sure about that though, cause CJ and Lillard are best friends. There are also reports that the Trailblazers think Simmons is too ball dominant for Lillard. Plus, I don’t think Simmons can really coexist with Nurkic and Nance."
"At least they made it through round one, even with embiid missing the first two games of that series.  They also went on an eleven game win streak with Ben at the wheel when Embiid got hurt that season.    Ben has improved his defense massively since 2018 so i'm not concerned by the Tatum and Brown shooting numbers, but to your point Dario Saric was a much more useful offensive piece in that series and Ben struggling to be useful in the half court during the playoffs is absolutely a recurring, major problem.    Just saying i'd rather bet on Ben than Wiggins, Beasley, Brogdon or Heild."
"Back when Markelle fultz was a rookie and still with the sixers, people were trying to push the nickname The FEDS (Fultz, Embiid, Dario Saric, Simmons)"
Those fans would be grasping at straws and laughed out the room. It’s like how no one mentions how donte divicenzo was hurt for the bucks or how nobody cares that Dario saric was out for the suns.
"How so? Other than Jah his picks were pretty good and no one bats 1.000  A bunch of 2nd rounders some of whom worked out some didn't. That's normal. Jerami Grant was one of these for example.  MCW and Dario Saric at 11 and 12 respectively are what people point to, but are they really evidence of Hinkie drafting poorly? Lots of guys drafted around there don't work out and MCW was ROY. Hinkie traded him when his value was high, was really good maneuvering all in all.  Saric gets a bad rap but he was still playing meaningful minutes on a finals team last season and has been a contributor scoring double digits most of his career. People just don't like awkward looking euros who aren't transcendent talents."
"Maybe a three team trade then?  * Suns receive: Thad Young * Spurs receive: Jalen Smith  * Thunder receive: Dario Saric, Chandler Hutchinson, 2022 Phoenix second-round pick, 2023 Phoenix second round pick.   Spurs get a young player to help in the frontcourt and have their roster spot issue addressed, Suns get a win-now player who'll be in their rotation, and the Thunder get two picks for absorbing $12m in salary- $4m of which comes off the books next year. Not sure what the Thunder's price to take on salary and facilitate the deal is, but they have the cap to do it. I can't imagine Phoenix throws in a first for a guy who'll be a sixth man and is older, I think they'll want to chase a star. Big hang up here is what the Thunder want, Presti seems to love picks but at what point does he cash out?"
"* Suns receive: Thad Young. * Spurs receive: Jalen Smith, Dario Saric.   Who says no?"
"&gt; It’s only now after they failed you’re calling them bad.  many people in our sub were calling out the tobias trade when it happened. most of us were fooled with the horford signing.  &gt;Same thing once Doc got fired from the clippers y’all were thirsty as fuck  this is a blanket statement. many many many fans were against the rivers signing. including myself.  Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."
"Wolves got Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton (who was our first round pick at like 14 the year before).  &amp;nbsp;  When a player makes it known he wants out and the team holding him tries to hold out for the best offer sometimes you have to accept a deal for peanuts."
"Mmm, fair, although he could still be back by the playoffs, ACL treatment has gotten a lot better in the last 5-10 years. Plus, he has another year on his deal whereas Thad only has 1 and is like 7 years older than Dario. I mean, Suns DO have a lot of young talent, and they're a returning finals team. I don't wanna say it's a short-sighted move b/c in their position they need to compete and we're talking about a backup player.   In any case, I think the Suns can match salaries without Saric, though it will be more complicated cause it would take 3-4 players, and they'd have to wait till Nov to trade guys like Frank"
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
"I was reading fast and thought it was ""Dario Saric"" instead of ""Darko Saric"" and was very deer-in-the-headlights for a second there."
Dario Saric  Domantas Sabonis  Nikola Jokic
"i doubt they'll get a DPE (for dario saric, ACL?)  doctors have to agree that he will likely be out till 6/15/22 for the team to get one for him, at the current point in time i don't think any doctor would project his recovery going so poorly that this would happen (same goes for jamal murray, and kawhi, although i wouldn't be surprised if kawhi just didn't play this season, but i don't think that's the same as a doctor agreeing that he _can't_ play).  they have until 1/15 to apply for the DPE, i guess if he suffers some setbacks in the meantime it is possible."
Kristaps Porzingis - Dario Saric = Dragan Bender
"That's not how it happened. Jimmy requested a trade when the season ended as he was unhappy with the Wolves. Jimmy would have been unhappy with any team where he wasn't the unquestioned star. Thibs ignored the trade request and let the team fall apart. There was no reason for KAT to rush into extension talks as he was guaranteed the max extension. He had every reason to wait to see how the Butler situation would play out before resigning.   Thibs played the hand poorly, waited until he had no leverage and ended up settling for a package of Dario Saric and Robert Covington for Butler. None of that was KAT's fault."
"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we’re trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don’t think that’s like a tile team but that team would “maximize” ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
"the last year he was healthy, they won 36 games where the leaders in games started were: Andrew Wiggins (at his worst arguably), Taj Gibson, Josh Okogie, Jeff Teague, Dario Saric, and Tyus Jones.   he was +11 in on/off last year.   the growth in his passing is what has prompted me to believe this really. i really think he is in a tier of his own after Jokic. KAT can do just about everything at a high level on the offensive end"
The last what 8 games and first round were won by who Marco belinelli Dario saric who was it ?
Tbf y’all lost Dario Saric who is the key piece to every championship team
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."
"I like the Sixers, and only the Sixers.  But there are plenty of other players that I root for.  TJ McConnell, RoCo, Kemba Walker, Chris Paul, Dario Saric, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, Bobi, Deaaron Fox, and a couple more.  I’d never root for any of these players when they play against Philly but I do any other time."
"Duncan Robinson, Alex Caruso, Red Velvet, Tyler Herro, Luka, Dragic, Dario Saric"
"Joel, Nerlens and MCW flying to spain to watch a Dario Saric game lmao   https://twitter.com/JoelEmbiid/status/507237616899870720  Lets not forget Okafor beating up a Celtics fan in boston, best thing he's ever done here"
"Well, you guys had Jrue, but they decided to trade him for Nerlens Noel and a 1st rounder (Dario Saric) 😅"
Dario Saric was the D
"Not at all.    The reason there's doubt with Ayton isn't because of his box score numbers, it's because his play has been wildly inconsistent.  He got suspended in his 2nd year, he played bad for 1/4 of his 3rd season.. they were using Dario Saric to close out the 4th for a stretch.  He's openly said he defines success as getting his 2nd contract.  There's a question about motivation and work ethic.  It has nothing to do with his box score, it's his consistency.  The Suns are hesitant to put 5 years in on someone who hasn't pieced together a completely good season.   His talent and upside are all great, but they want to see more consistency before a 5 year max.   Agree or disagree, that is where the issue is coming up.  It has nothing to do with his box score"
"Nah there's definite concerns but Ayton brought them upon himself.  He got caught up in the money scandal in college, he defined success as ""making my second contract"", he got suspended for 25 games in his 2nd year and in his 3rd year he had 20 games where he played really bad. It got to the point where Dario Saric was closing out games in the middle of the season.  Ayton can be a great player, he has been a great player, his playoff run was ridiculously impressive, but he has brought a lot of unnecessary questions on himself for his work ethic and motivation.  Are they true? Idk only Ayton knows what motivates him, but perception is reality in the league.    The good news for Ayton is it's an easy fix.  Go out and play hard for one year and you'll get a 5 year max no problem.    But there are legitimate concerns from the FO side to committing to 5 years."
dario saric reading this crying and throwing up
You can see it game to game.  There were stretches last year he took games off and was invisible.  He'll be essentially was benched for frank Kaminsky and Dario saric due to effort.
"Ayton, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric and three firsts for Kat if he for some reason asks out this year. Atleast this my dream scenario."
"Not so hot take, that pass was so spot on any center could have completed that play. The ball was literally over the basket. That's not the highlight you show of you're Ayton. He needs to be showing defensive highlights of Kaminsky and Saric getting cooked, and then Ayton not getting cooked. Here's an issue for Ayton (that is 100% not his fault), in those highlights he's comparing himself to forwards because the  Suns decided not to have a **true** backup center last season. The Suns got one this season.   Note: I guess Kaminsky, but Kaminsky started a ton of games at Forward for the Suns last season. And Dario played more overall. 871 min for Dario compared to 715 for Frank"
"Brogdon's only competition was Dario Saric and Joel Embiid who only played 37 games. Even with Joel clearly being the better player, there was barely a race realistically as Brogdon doubled the game's played while putting up solid on a playoff team."
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
i know this is a joke but just yesterday the blazers lost to the suns (without cp3 and dario saric) 74-119 and the hornets (without hayward rozier and oubre) lost to the mavs 59-127.
"I can’t believe someone typed that list of names and didn’t realize they were making the opposite point than they were trying to. Terrell Brandon, Wally and Joe Smith? In 15 years people are going to say the same about KAT lol. You’re telling me he won nothing with Deangelo Russell, Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Crawford, Dario Saric and Taj Gibson? Had to be a bum."
"Do you think the Suns weren't dealing with injuries all year also?  Booker had an injury to his shooting hand during the season that hampered him all year, Dario saric had a major injury that kept him out for a large part of the year and then we lost him permanently in the finals, cam Johnson probably our best shooter injured his shooting hand during the season and it affected him tremendously until he was healthy in the playoffs, DeAndre Aiden injured his ankle last year and we aggravated it this year and was hampered by it during the regular season all year and he injured his shoulder during the season which bothered him all season and reinjured it during the playoffs.  Campaign got hurt during the playoffs and Missed time.  Why were those teams dealing with injuries, oh I don't know maybe because Anthony Davis has been injury prone his entire career, maybe because kawhi Leonard has been injury prone his entire career maybe because LeBron passed his prime and is a giant human being who plays an ultra athletic play style.    Not only did they all get a huge break in the middle of the season to allow their bodies to repair, but they were all load managing to help keep them fresh for the playoffs.  One could argue that this year teams had the most preparation for the playoffs than any team previously.  Players wanting time off to help prevent injuries used to be taboo, now it's the norm."
"&gt; Played through an injured West,  CP3 was injured almost the entire finals.  Dario Saric was injured the entire finals.  Cam Payne got hurt in the finals.  CP3 missed games against the Lakers.  Etc. etc. etc."
"They had all their guys besides I guess Dario Saric by the end   And if you want to go down that road Morris and Zu had knee problems, no Kawhi and no Serge while the Suns had a significant rest advantage whereas the Clippers were playing every other night for a month straight"
"What a dumbass take. Game 6: 30 points on 50% from the field. Game 7: 49 points on 47% from the field and played fucking 53 minutes to try and carry the nets. You act like he was inefficient and also casually leave out game 5: 49 point triple double on 70% from the field. Harden being healthy instead of KD is a hypothetical and no one knows what would have happened.   Bucks went on to play injured teams??? Giannis was missing for the last few games vs the hawks and he wasn't 100% against the suns, and literally no one other than Dario Saric was injured on the suns. You're fucking dumb as shit"
"Agreed.  Ben (and Joel to a lesser extent) make three-point specialists look good and cover for them on D.   **JJ Redick** set the record for the oldest player to set a career high in ppg, then broke his own record the next year.    **Landry Shamet** was first team all-rookie with the sixers and hasn't matched any of his advanced stats from that season since (PER, TS, BPM, WS, VORP).    **Dario Saric** was a quality starter in his early twenties, second on a 50 win team in scoring and he has been a bench player after he left.  **Covington** is another guy who set all his career highs in philly.  **Furkan Korkmaz** was a free agent anybody could have had for the minimum but he's only a rotation player in Philly because Simmons covers for him on defense and sets him up on offense.  **Seth Curry** was a MLE signing who played on 5 teams in his first three seasons and has found a real home in Philly alongside Jo and Ben.  All these guys take at least half of their shots from three.  Ben is a tough fit and he shat the bed in the playoffs after he fell apart at the line but it's easy to forget he's a three-time all-star who made an all-nba team for a reason."
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
That bum Dario Saric who played hot potato with the ball every time he got it in the playoffs last year.
"&gt; and yeah he was very good in the playoffs,   Nobody talks about if but he was very quietly a total mess in the finals after game 1 regardless of his volume stats it was the biggest reason they lost if DA plays like he did round 1-3 they probzvly win. It got to the point they had to take him off Giannis in game 6 and he got benched for a stretch in the second half for Frank the Tank   People gave him a pass because he’s young and he doesn’t get held to star expectations. Well you can’t just ignore that if you want $160+ mil. And this says nothing of his regular season where he was nowhere near a max level player and you had games Monty would bench him for Dario Saric in the 4th quarter the first 2/3 of the season"
"i appreciate the discourse, i dont think its a secret im a huge hinkie fan.  This stuff still kinda gets under my skin because people like to rewrite history or just make things up and i was there for all of it.  Watching 95% of the 10-72 season shit like that.  Its just so easy to throw out a comment without much thought behind it, everyone always says its easy to tear things down for example.  He never got a chance to do anything else.  If he survived 6 more months Embiid and Dario Saric would have taken the floor for him with one of the best 3 and D players already in the league in Roco.  Maybe Ben Simmons or Ingram too (maybe Ben doesnt get hurt due to butterfly effect) who knows.  It is a great thought experiment but too many people just want to tear him down because things look grim 6 years later.  Embiid has even lamented over him being injured is what caused Hinkie to get forced out.  There is so much interesting stuff to talk about but its always hes overrated or shit like that."
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
That was Dario Saric.
I think that's also why they traded for Dario Saric. I don't remember if Simmons's year-skipping injury was before or after the Sixers drafted him but they probably would've taken him even more happily if it was before.
"I mean, I don't think ""it didn't work with a washed-up Dwight"" is argument for ""Simmons can't play with a rim-runner."" There are other kinds of non-shooting centers, though for starters Myles Turner and Christian Wood would both be perfect fits with Simmons. Also a lot of PFs who can play small-ball 5 would be good too - Jeff Green, Millsap and Tucker, at least back before they were this old, Thad Young, Dario Saric."
2011 - fareid to mirotic  2012 - Evan Fournier to sullinger  2013 - Rudy Gobert to livio jean charles  2014 doug McDermott to Dario saric  2015 - mudiay to Stanley Johnson
"Jimmy Butler &gt; Bojan Bogdanović  Marquis Teague &gt; Festus Ezeli   Tony Snell &gt; Gorgui Dieng  Doug McDermott &gt; Dario Saric  Bobby Portis &gt; Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  A slight downgrade for the bulls since I’d rather have JB, Bobby, and Doug McBuckets. Of course it really wasn’t as exciting seeing as we had generally low picks these years since we were a solid playoff team."
"Yeah and Harden wasn't traded at the deadline specifically because Houston tried to wait and it didn't work out. They had to bail out early to salvage the situation.  They didn't get any of the packages they were holding out for and settled for a package that was no better than what they already had on the table during the offseason.  Jimmy Butler was another player Minnesota tried the waiting game with and it didn't work. They didn't end up lasting until the deadline either and had to settle for less than they were hoping for.  Minnesota waited and they got: Dario Saric, Robert Covington and a 2nd round pick.   Doesnt sound like a great couple of examples.   All it shows is that Philadelphia is going to put on a brave face, get the shit kicked out of them and then settle pretty quickly for a package no better than what's already on the table.  By comparison, I could point put the Paul George trades, Westbrook trade, Anthony Davis trade, etc etc.   All cases of offseason trades where the teams actually got returns they were pretty happy with.  &gt;Tobias  Was an expiring non-star you guys picked up cheap because his old franchise didn't want to pay him what he was about to demand.  &gt;but let's not act like big deals don't go down in season  The best time to trade him is already in your rear view mirror. The trade deadline is a buyer's market not a seller's market.  Let's not pretend like your situation is going to improve by waiting for a worse time to sell your star.  You said the best time to trade him was at the deadline. Then you provided a couple bad examples and changed your tune to ""well at least some trades happen during the season"".  &gt;the trade deadline is historically the best time to sell  Lol"
"We didn't have the size to contend with the Bucks and Giannis went nuclear. Our backup center last year was Dario Saric, who was already undersized for a 5, and he got hurt in the first game of the series. After that, the Bucks outsized us at every position and just played better ball.  I would love a rematch now that we have Javale and the rest of our younger guys have taken that next step."
Saric when healthy is a monster don't be disrespecting boy haha.  But in all seriousness healthy Dario is a 6moy candidate and is unironically one of the best playmaking centers in the league (not trying to say which injury is worse or what not)  Like Dario is Frank the tank if you made him better at everything but made him smaller
suns have been missing dario saric since the playoffs last year nobody ever brings him up  that was a big reason why they didn't have enough to win the finals.  they ran out of big bodies to throw at giannis.  that's why they went out and got javale this year.    when giannis is picking up fouls like candy at halloween your frontcourt is going to be fouling out of half the games.   or at least playing big minutes with 4-5 fouls where they have to really adjust how they defend out of the fear of fouling out
"I was just looking at the $9 mil and how the Knicks could use a good spot up shooter or impact player instead of Kemba. $9 million on the open market can get you an Alex Caruso, Montrez, Seth Curry, Dario Saric--all around $9 mil a year."
Second Unit:  PG - Cam Payne  SG - Landry Shamet  SF - Cam Johnson  PF - Dario Saric (When healthy)  C - Javale McGee  Absolutely insane depth.
"Arron afflalo, vuc and… dario saric is a haul?  You seem to have missed the “protected” aspect of all those picks. Basically all of the firsts were protected 1-5 and didn’t end up conveying for one reason or another   It’s worse than having 2 pick 30s, because ⅔ of those FRPs didn’t convey at all. The other one was the 11th pick in 2014… not exactly lighting the world aflame  The previous FO somehow managed to bungle the few resources they had even worse by making the elfrid/saric swap, but this isn’t exactly a great haul unless you consider Vuc the developed product instead of the prospect he was before the magic developed him"
"Wishing Super Dario ""Antichrist"" Saric a good recovery. I dont think he comes back before playoffs, if at all. Instead we get Nader in his place."
Cam Payne  Cam Johnson  Jae Crowder  Lebron  Dario Saric  My bad I just put prime lebron with all the suns role players averaging under 10 ppg
Dario Saric and Jared Dudley.
No I’m not lol. I know Horford back then was good he still is good but are you telling me he was Embiid good? Sorry going into that series Simmons and Embiid were looked at as the best two players in that series especially coming off of you guys dismantling Miami. You guys had Robert Convington who is a decent enough wing. He was able to later land you a Jimmy Butler alongside Dario Saric. You guys had 16 Ppg JJ Redick as well who was averaging more than Tatum or Brown that year. You guys were the 3rd seed and we were the 2nd we were only the 2nd because of how good Kyrie was. If we didn’t have him you guys would’ve been the higher seed and you got beat 4-1. No offense but do you understand basketball? Cuz I think if a team has the best two players going into a series and the other team’s leading scoring is a 19 year old you should win. There’s no legit reason why you should’ve lost 4-1. You had people thinking you guys could get to the finals that year cuz Bron and the Cavs were looking shaky too. That’s why I’ll take Tatum and Brown over your guy.
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He’s no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I’m being petty but I’ve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I’m a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
"Go look at the roster of those teams and try to figure out why.   In fact, heres a reminder of what the Wolves traded an All NBA talent for....Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick.   2 rotation players... one of which had a major injury that year, and the other that didn't even wanna be in Minnesota and played like it. One guy thats not in the league anymore and a 2nd round pick...   Shouldn't be rocket science around here that when you take an All NBA talent off the team and replace it with bench guys, the team gets worse. Also, the last two seasons have been Towns' worst when it comes to injuries. So shouldn't exactly be shocking the Wolves have missed the playoffs since Jimmy left."
in order of importance  1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Deandre Ayton  5. JaVale McGee  6. Cam Johnson  7. Cam Payne  8. Jae Crowder (Dario Saric if he was healthy)
Jalen Smith has been so bad that they declined his player option. Dario Saric is out for the season and the spurs have a full roster. There's no way I would do that trade for 1 second.
"Maybe Saric could take some of his minutes once he's back? We could somewhat run a big lineup of Payne, Shamet, CamJ, Dario, and Javale?"
"This sub loves praising the Warriors, but why is no one talking about the defending Western Conference Champion Suns being on a 10 game win streak?  I didn't realize until now that the Suns are currently on a 10 game win streak.. why is no-one talking about this?  They beat a strong Mavs team yesterday and nearly won by 30 pts against the Rockets with a scintillating Kevin Porter Jr. And they still have Dario Saric to come back from injury.  For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what's the main reason for the complete domination? You would think they'd have a bunch of struggles to start the season after their agonizing Finals loss.."
Hey is Bobby Portis for sale? We can offer an injured Dario saric and a mediocre g league center who’s so skinny we call him stix?
"You make a great a point. That Jimmy butler deal was a great move, but the wolves flipped a super athletic high potential all star for a solidified one to win now with Kat and Wiggins.   To then forced to trade Jimmy  in less then a year for role players like Dario saric and covington who aren't on the team anymore lol.   I think you forgt that Tom timbs got the gm and coaching role of the team. He loves his own players. Started signing every old Chicago bulls player avaible"
"Cam Payne, Dario Saric, Deandre Ayton.  It's not even, sorry."
I see Minny fans thinking that Towns for Ayton + Bridges and picks is going happen.  They'll get Ayton + Jalen Smith + Dario Saric and picks and that's it.
I forgot the exact timeline too but it didn't look right seeing Embiid in Wiggins year. Brogdon's was a weird year because everyone saw that Embiid was dominant and amazing but still couldn't vote for him cause he missed 60% of the year lol. Real tight race between Brodgon and future hall of famer Dario Saric haha
"Spurs - Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, future 2nd pick  Suns - Thaddeus Young  To make it dumber, add in 2 firsts from the Suns because Thad Young was on a graphic with MJ and Bird once"
"I mean what else are they gonna do?   They've sucked, got lucky in the draft by getting the 1st pick, and still can't put together a top 10 seeded team:  \#1 Ant Edwards, #6 Jarret Culver, #12 Dario Saric, #5 Kris Dunn, #13 Zach LaVine, KAT #1, traded for Wiggins #1, Rubio #5, Wesley Johnson #4, Derrick Williams #2, Kevin Love #5   Out of all their lottery picks ones that have ""hit"" are Ant Edwards (likely), Lavine who they traded for Jimmy, KAT, and Love who they traded. Wiggins and Saric are also decent NBA players but they traded those guys too."
"Took me a second to compute that you weren't saying Marko jaric, Dario saric or darko milicic lol"
"People were shitting on him trading for Adams with pick to begin with.   They traded a first rounder for a 27m/year center who can't space the floor.  If they were gonna use a first rounder to fetch a center, they could have try at Dario Saric on a bad Suns team."
"Suns look like they’re trying new things out offensively, plus CP3 is coming off an injury and Book is coming back from COVID so feeling neutral there. Defense has been concerning though, that’s the one thing that was super consistent last season and we are very clearly missing having guys like Torrey Craig and Dario Saric as small ball switchable pieces off the bench.  I’m confident things will even out but I really hope we find a way to add someone who can fill in as a switchable 4/5, Thad Young was on the radar for a while but I don’t know that it’ll happen"
"Lol that was Sengun not Jokic  Jokic won MVP of the ABA, a league of former Yugoslavian nations (Dario Saric won that too fun fact)"
&gt;2019 (6th pick) Jarrett Culver: traded on draft night for Dario Saric.  Jarrett Culver was traded for Dario Saric and Cam Johnson. Massive win for the sun's on that one.
"Spurs should trade for him, Thad Young for Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, and a second. You could probably get better value for Thad Young tho if you let him play."
"It's also one of the biggest indicators that regression is likely for the Suns this year (along with the extremely good health your team had last year). We're already seeing the health be an issue with no Dario Saric, the bench is weaker.  But those games against elite teams are usually toss-ups that are decided by margins and weirdness at times, especially on national TV. It's rare to be dominant against all the great teams two years in a row, whereas beating the bad teams is consistent (that's also why Portland has consistently been a really firm playoff team in Dame's career, ranging from 3-6 seed - they just beat the pants off the bad teams, more or less consistently). Point being though - a bit of regression against the elite teams with similar performance against the bad teams would probably put PHX around 5th or so this year in the West. Substantial regression against elite teams would be worse ofc."
Dario Saric looks like a McPoyle.
Dario Saric looks like Little Nicky
"Let's take this to another level. Look at the lottery picks for the sixers since the 2013, the beginning of the process: Nerlens Noel, MCW, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Jalil Okafor, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz and Zhaire Smith. Besides Embiid and Simmons, noting but backups and out-of-the-league guys."
"1. He didn't take Noel 2. It was MCW, Embiid then Okafor. Noel (and Dario Saric) were draft day trades.  3. Embiid had a setback in Spring 2015 which is probably why they panicked and took Okafor. The top 10 in 2015 was trash though so other than Porzingis and Cauley-Stein, they would be stuck with a stiff."
"2013 draft: traded Jrue for Noel and a pick  2014 draft: Embiid, Saric, Grant. Signed Covington from D League.   2015 draft. Okarfor, Holmes. Took cap space on for a Kings pick swap, later becoming 3rd overall pick.   15-16 season we start 1-21 but had a lot of injuries. We were still in tank mode though. Big collar colangelo brought in by Adam Silver (very legal, very cool) Hinkie out. Bigger collar colangelo brought in to replace   2016 draft: Simmons, Furkan  2017 draft: Kings pick used to trade up for Fultz.  Covington and Dario for Butler  Shamet and 2 first for Tobias"
"Except that if they had drafted Luka then they would have presumably built the team differently, not just gone with dario saric"
"Can't forget Dario ""Antichrist"" Saric"
Dario Saric is good but not quite as good as Cody Zeller
Dario saric better be playing in the wakandan G league next season
Dario Saric looking like a bonafide scrub
Dario Saric was pretty decent for the Sixers especially that series vs. Miami. Tf happened to him?
RIP dario saric
"First: Every starter in every team. Most 2nd unit guys on any team. As for actual player names, for defensive play I would take a guy like Alex Caruso over Simmons. At least he frustrates the offense and draws charges. How many times does Simmons throw his body in the way and draw critical fouls? I haven't seen it. In offense, I would take a player like Dario Saric over Simmons any day. He takes 3s and hits them at a respectable rate. He attacks the rim and can throw down a dunk and get and 1 (and make it). He also moves away from the ball to try and space the floor,  meanwhile Simmons impersonated a statue on offense.   And for what's it worth, I don't think either of those guys are particularly good. But I would take both of them over Simmons. At least they don't play scared. And it's not just those two players, it's any typical bench guy that plays like them. Seriously dude, look at Ben's shot chart in the 2nd half this series. If you saw it, you would think you were looking at a 3rd stringers shot chart. Not a supposed all star.   And I am not even bringing up how much these guys are getting paid. If you made a cost to performance ratio of every player in the league, I would shocked if Ben wasn't dead last."
Hey that's ROY runner up Dario Saric.
"Dario Saric, dummy. You come at the king, you better not miss."
Dario Saric
"I mean Robert Covington and Dario Saric turned into Jimmy Butler turned into Josh Richardson turned into Seth Curry, so maybe Seth Curry was the final stage of the process all along"
"Sure, but we’ve seen players escalate situations to force their way out. Kyrie threatened to have a season-ending procedure if he wasn’t moved. Kawhi was willing to sit out the season if I remember right. James Harden intentionally flouted COVID protocols. Butler threw a tantrum and set up an interview to embarrass the franchise, then loafed it up and down the court for 13 games before tanking his value so severely he got moved for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.   The way things are currently constructed, players have a lot of power to get what they want. There’s no way to fully combat that, but if a dude not even halfway through a rookie contract is trying to force his way out, the league needs reevaluate how they maintain parity and keep the league as a whole running."
