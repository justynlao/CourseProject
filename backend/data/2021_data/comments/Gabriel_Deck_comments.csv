I'm here for Gabriel Deck
Gabriel Deck when?
"&gt;The best players in the G-League are typically end of the bench guys in the NBA. Sometimes they get minutes on tanking teams or they were on a rookie contract sent down to gain experience.  Right. And the same is true for the best euroleague players. Shane Larkin was an end of the bench guy. Gabriel Deck just got signed to OKC, a tanking team and he still probably won’t play much.   &gt;But overall the G-League has nowhere close to the budget that they have in Europe. A guy like Nikola Mirotic was a solid NBA player making millions to play in Europe. He is in a team where multiple guys have played in the NBA. If a player is really good in the G-League but they can’t crack an NBA roster they frequently go play in Europe.  You’re proving my point for me. The euroleague literally has the caliber of players in the g league. That’s the point — the talent discrepancy is not that different. The best player in Europe is an American from the g league.   &gt;Compare that to Europe where they have a big pay roll, and are getting guys from the G-League, NBA, and the best overall players from there, it makes their league much more competitive overall. Their teams are just way better 1-10 and the best teams have multiple players capable of logging NBA minutes.  Comparing the competitiveness of the leagues is missing the point ten-fold. We’re comparing the pool of talent. It’s not that much different.  The teams are more cohesive and conducive to win but talent wise they aren’t that far off. The best team in Europe has 1-2 guys at most that can play in the NBA."
We’re doing the exact thing same with Gabriel Deck right now. Basically a long term non guaranteed deal to a proven professional
What about Gabriel Deck?
"Presti must be stopped, he did it again with Gabriel Deck"
"I started watching the NBA when manu won his second championship in 05, I was 7 years old. When Manu retired I kept watching the spurs as I was already invested in them, but now there are 2 more Argentinians in the NBA, so I try to watch as many nuggets game as I can, and then watch Gabriel Deck highlights because I'm not watching this dogshit thunder team   so yeah what I did was cheer for the team that has my countrymen, I also enjoy watching Luka Doncic play, so if the mavs are playing ill just leave the TV on their game"
"Charlie Brown Jr, Jaylen Hoard, Gabriel Deck, Josh Hall, Justin Robinson  Heard any of those names before?  Our best player the past month is an undrafted Sophomore."

He won't last much longer with hungry young lions like Saben Lee and Gabriel Deck gunning for their time in the spotlight.
"Has some trouble with late season additions, for example it says George Hill and Gabriel Deck were teammates, which is not correct. Might be impossible to fix though lol"
"Gabriel Deck, longtime international player. Signed with the OKC Thunder halfway through the year, he was a pretty solid role player for us"
That’s Gabriel Deck. Another Presti gem in OKC
"I doubt any of the top 4 will budge so I think the most likely move will be to take those picks after #6 (16, 18, 34, 36 &amp; 55) plus some of the more trade-baity guys on the roster (Kenrich Williams, Gabriel Deck) to try and get up as high into the late lottery as possible.  I could see them going after the New Orleans #10 using some of those picks and offering to eat up Bledsoe and/or Adams' contracts. If it takes both 16+18 to get back in the top 10 then they could take those 3 2nd rounders and watch how the board falls and try to trade up for a guy they really like somewhere in the 20s like Thor, Murphy or Prkacin."
Gabriel Deck too!
"All time: Manu Ginobilli ofc  Currently I'd say Gabriel Deck will be a powerhouse once OKC gets their shit together, couldn't do much this season, don't sleep on him!. Facu is facu."
bro wait until you see Gabriel Deck.   Now THAT is a slow free throw if I've ever seen any
I understand how the salary minimum works. What I’m saying is that Horford was not the only bad contract on the market and that they also could have spent the money gambling on prospects such as what they did with Gabriel Deck. Obviously they had to spend it but there was multiple ways to do it so there was still an opportunity cost to trading for Horford.
I will marry Gabriel Deck one day
Gabriel Deck is a problem
"For the Thunder, Joe Mussatto (The Oklahoman) and Brandon Rahbar (Daily Thunder) slot into Tier 1. Royce is not really on the Thunder beat anymore so he's probably in Tier 2. Andrew Schlecht is probably in Tier 2 as well, he broke the signing of Gabriel Deck but is not usually a newsbreaker. Tier 3 is the likes of Addams Francisco"
Lmao Gabriel Deck is our 3rd highest paid player???
Fantasy bball legend gabriel deck

"Come home Hami. You'll get playing time with us.  If Roby, Ty Jerome and Gabriel Deck can get playing time, he can."
"Trade idea:   Mavericks get:   * Christian Wood  Thunder get:   * John Wall  * 2027 Mavericks 1st (top 5 protected)  * 2023 Rockets 1st (lotto protected each year until unprotected 2027)  * 2022, 2024 Mavericks 2nds   Rockets get:   * Kristaps Porzingis  * Darius Bazley  * Gabriel Deck  * Derrick Favors  It works in the trade machine financially. Mavericks burn a pick to turn KP into Christian Wood. Rockets move Wood and a heavily protected pick to get rid of John Wall, and they get back a fair return. Thunder take on Wall's contract to get a few picks. Who says no?"
