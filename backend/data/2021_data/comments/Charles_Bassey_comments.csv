"We also bought pick 53 that ended up being Charles Bassey for $2m, so they're easily replaceable"
Charles Bassey 2-way on the way
Sixers drafted Charles Bassey...  Your point still stands though because he is more like a 2nd Starting Center.
very minor but Philly traded cash to New Orleans for pick 53 to draft Charles Bassey
"&gt; Yeah have you seen him play dudes a beast dont be suprised when he averages 22/8/3 his rookie year  22/6/3, close enough. This guy is a prophet. Charles Bassey will save the Sixers, I believe."
"Holy shit thank you for holding onto this treasure. Devin Booker? Outta the league. Luka? Role player. Oh but big Charles Bassey, that mf'er is top 10 easy."
"Was expecting Charles Bassey and/or Sharife Cooper since he’s still on the board, but our FO continues to surprise.  0/3 on my draft predictions this year"
Charles Bassey is what we in the industry call a SLEEPER
"Brown sucks lol. His highlight plays look flashy but he has no clue what he’s doing out there. If we’re looking for a Kanter replacement, Charles Bassey would’ve more than sufficed."
Well that’s not Charles Bassey
"Charles Bassey, he is more pro-ready than a lot of other centers in this draft"
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
Charles Bassey is going to have an extremely solid 15 year NBA career.
&gt;Couldn't Be Whiter Division  &gt;   &gt;Jack Anderson  &gt;Charles Bassey  &gt;Herbert Jones  &gt;Matthew Hurt  &gt;John Petty  I'm sorry but David Duke needs to be here for obvious reasons
"Josh Primo, Ayo Dosunmu, Kessler Edwards, Charles Bassey"
"Haha, in shambles? We’re currently discussing Charles Bassey and getting Paul Reed out of the mud"
Charles Bassey
"There is no cap space. If they were able to somehow get rid of Ben without taking on any salary at all, they'd still be right around the cap. They're using roster spots on guys like Paul Reed and Charles Bassey, they don't need roster spots.  A few good role players and picks is not better than having Ben, it really is that simple. There is nothing gained by dumping Ben, and they already have more than enough role players. What they're missing is a star PG, and dumping Ben for anything less than a star PG closes the window. And Morey isn't going to close the window just so he doesn't have to deal with this."
Sixers rookie Charles bassey!
If fox holmes hield Barnes Mitchell Halliburton can’t beat Charles bassey and Andre Drummond I don’t know if it’s the coaching
Yeah Charles Bassey sent them to the lottery
Too valuable:  Embiid Maxey Thybulle Simmons (fml)  Contract is too good: Curry Korkmaz  Upside: Basketball Paul Reed Jaden Springer  Not Harris because I don’t think anyone else would take his contract willingly. Thoughts? Other sixers fans want to tell me who I forgot? Charles Bassey?
Charles Bassey   Or  Tyrese Maxey
"Ask the Nuggets fans, who will agree  Charles Bassey got the MVP trophy locked up fam"
Dont forget my man Charles Bassey. But yes this is a great point. Getting a couple good role players does almost nothing for this team.  There are 10 players on this team I have no trouble seeing play 20+ minutes in the playoffs.  This team obviously needs another star. You are the first non-sixers fan Ive seen understand that lol.
he's still sore from Charles Bassey destroying him a couple nights ago
"Did you watch the game? It wasn’t really an abusive 30 points, and he was being guarded by Charles Bassey. It was more of a “holy shit nobody can get a bucket let me try to carry these losers” 30"
3/3/2 on 0/5 shooting in the 2nd half (after his father Charles Bassey started clamping him)
he's faking it because he's embarrassed from getting sonned by Charles Bassey last night
"3/3/2 on 0/5 FGs and 3/4 FTs in the 2nd half + Sonned by Charles Bassey and lost to Philly without Embiid, Simmons, Thybulle, and Danny Green.  Nuggets are gonna be fighting for a play-in spot this year and Jokic has no shot at MVP."
People downvoting this clearly didn't watch Chokic score 3 points on 0/5 shooting in the 2nd half last night. That fraud got sonned by Charles Bassey and lost to Philly's G league team lmao
The second the Sixers took Drummond off him and put on Charles Bassey he couldn’t score
Charles Bassey and our shooters rediscovered how to shoot the ball through the hoop.
Charles Bassey for starter
Andre Drummond should never start again. Charles Bassey stepped up for the Sixers off the bench. Seth Curry regained his rhythm. No one not named Jokic wanted to show up for the Nuggets tonight. Some of the Nuggets turnovers were brutal to watch. Nuggets need Jamal back. There was no Zeke Nnaji and that saddens me.
Jokic is going to be seeing Charles Bassey in his nightmares
I rmeber when Charles Bassey was mentioned in the same convo as Evan Mobley back in high school lol
The Sixers played with 8 guys last night including Charles Bassey and Paul Reed.  I understand what he's trying to say.
You almost lost a half to Charles Bassey and the funky bunch
"Sir Charles for Bassey , that’s not taken already is it?"
Charles Bassey getting real NBA minutes who woulda guessed? Not me
oh boy Charles Bassey minutes
"Do we even have enough players for this game to be played? We're down Embiid, Tobias, Simmons, Matisse, Isaiah Joe, and now Seth.    That leaves Maxey, Niang, Korkmaz, Drummond, Danny Green, Paul Reed, and Shake. Is Charles Bassey our eighth man or is he in the g-league? Either way, I hope these guys stay healthy playing so many fucking minutes since this is our fifth game in the last six days."
"&gt; we don't have room on the roster for a 12th man making 10mil  ""man we'd really like Malcolm Brogdon, but we can't take on Caris Levert too because we don't can't spare the roster spot of Charles Bassey so we're just gonna let our disgruntled toxic star hang out some more providing 0 value on a max contract""  Lol think this through my guy"
Charles Bassey time
We need to trade for shooters. Idc if we trade for goddamn bench shooters just get a bunch of them and throw in Charles bassey and whoever else to match player numbers
